India's petrochemical sector to grow over three-fold to USD 1 trillion by 2040: Hardeep Puri,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/petrochem/indias-petrochemical-sector-to-grow-over-three-fold-to-usd-1-trillion-by-2040-hardeep-puri/articleshow/115020200.cms,06-11-2024,"India's petrochemical sector is on track to touch USD 300 billion next year, with the potential to reach upwards of USD 1 trillion in 2040, Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri.
India is transforming into a global petrochemical powerhouse under Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
's leadership, said the minister in an X post, attaching a video highlighting the works that are underway and or are in the plans.
""Our petrochemical sector, once valued at USD 220 billion, is on track to reach USD 300 billion by 2025, with potential to touch USD 1 trillion by 2040,"" Puri said.
The growth in the sector means more jobs, growth, and a sustainable, self-sufficient future for every Indian, Puri said.
With initiatives like Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Regions (PCPIRs) and 100 per cent FDI, India is paving the way for global investors and building a cleaner, greener tomorrow.
Live Events
With a rising population and an expanding middle class, the demand for products, from fertilizers to electronics, is skyrocketing in India.
India is the world's sixth largest chemicals producer, there is still room to grow. India's per capita consumption is far below developed countries, which means massive potential.
The government is paving the way with major policies and investments. PSUs like ONGC and BPCL are joining forces with private players, pushing nearly USD 45 billion into new projects. And over the next decade, the video presentation said that the government expects another USD 100 billion in investments.
With 100 per cent foreign direct investment allowed automatically, India has become a top destination for global investors who see its potential.
But there is one challenge as India still imports around 45 per cent of its petrochemical intermediates.
Speciality chemicals are another high-growth area, expanding at 12 per cent each year. India is taking inspiration from global chemical hubs, learning how to create clusters that drive innovation, achieve economies of scale, and develop world-class facilities.

Top banks keen to share project loan for Adani Enterprises,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/petrochem/top-banks-keen-to-share-project-loan-for-adani-enterprises/articleshow/114789881.cms,31-10-2024,"Top public and private sector banks have lined up to take a bite of a rare greenfield project finance loan by
Adani Enterprises
as lead lender
State Bank of India
(
SBI
) looks to sell down a large chunk of the Rs 20,000-crore credit line it had sanctioned earlier this year for the conglomerate’s petrochemicals debut.
Bank of Baroda
(BoB),
Punjab National Bank
(PNB),
Union Bank of India
,
Central Bank of India
,
ICICI Bank
and
Axis Bank
have either committed or are in the process of committing funds to the $4-billion polyvinyl chloride (PVC) project at Mundra in Gujarat, people familiar with the developments said.
The 15-year loan was priced at 9.25% by SBI earlier this year.
“SBI was the sole underwriter for this loan a few months ago and has also disbursed a few hundred crores already. They plan to down sell it to other banks which is in line with their strategy. The bank plans to retain Rs 5,000-7,000 crore and downsell the rest of the loan, which will eventually be disbursed by other banks,” said a person familiar with the matter.
A loan selldown helps a bank reduce its risk to a particular entity and also opens up its group limits in case it wants to lend to other businesses in the group. The SBI loan was sanctioned for a
greenfield polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) plant to be set up by Adani Enterprises in Mundra Gujarat.
Live Events
The 2 million tonne PVC plan is the Adani's Group's first foray into the petrochemical sector and is expected to double India's capacity to make the plastic polymer which is used to make raincoats, wires, plastic pipes, shower curtains and medical equipment among other things.
“This is a huge greenfield project and an interesting one for banks to be part off because this is a highly rated credit. The commodity to be manufactured, the amount of the loan and the credit rating of the group is why so many banks are open to taking a share,” said a second person aware of the process.
Spokespersons at the Adani Group, SBI, BoB, PNB, Union Bank, Central Bank, ICICI and Axis Bank did not reply to separate emails seeking comment.
Domestic manufacturing of PVC will help India reduce dependence on imports even as economic activity and higher infrastructure spending is expected to increase demand for PVC. Adani expects to implement the first phase of the project by late 2026.
“The final securitisation papers for this loan are being drawn after which individual banks depending on their internal approvals will each take some part. These limits will be released by SBI and will be finally drawn down by the Adani Group from those banks whenever they need the money,” said the first person cited above.
Banks expect to complete the process of distributing the loan in a month’s time. Expectations are that the smaller banks will take anything between Rs 1000 crore to 2000 crore of the loan amount in their books.

Adani Group to commission $4-billion petchem project by next year,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/petrochem/adani-group-to-commission-4-billion-petchem-project-by-next-year/articleshow/112076091.cms,28-07-2024,"NEW DELHI: The
Adani Group
will commission the first phase of a USD 4 billion
PVC project
by December 2026, making its foray into the
petrochemicals sector
that is marked by a mismatch between domestic demand and supply, sources said.
Polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) - the third-most common synthetic plastic polymer made worldwide - is used to make products such as raincoats, shower curtains, window frames, pipes for indoor plumbing, medical equipment, wire & cable insulation, bottles, credit cards, and flooring.
India's annual PVC demand is roughly 4 million tonne but domestic production capacity is only about 1.5 million tonne, resulting in a supply-demand mismatch. With this disparity between domestic output and consumption expected to widen with an increase in consumption,
Adani
Group is looking to tap into the sector.
Adani Enterprises
, the group's flagship firm, is setting up a petrochemical cluster in Mundra in Gujarat. Within this cluster, it aims to set up a PVC plant with a capacity of 2 million tonne per annum, to be executed in phases, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The initial phase, with a capacity of 1 million tonne per annum, is slated for commissioning by December 2026, they said.
The group had in March last year halted the project saying it had decided to hold major equipment procurement and site construction activities pending financial closure. This followed US short seller Hindenburg Research in a report alleging financial and accounting fraud at Adani Group companies.

Though Adani group vehemently denied all allegations, the report sent Adani stock down and brought into focus its governance practices. The group refocused its resources on core competencies and scripted a comeback strategy that involved raising over USD 5 billion in equity and double of that in debt, repaying some debt and fully repaying share-backed financing.
And as markets regained confidence in the ports-to-energy conglomerate, Adani Group resumed work on the petrochemical plant.
Sources said State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium of lenders will be financing the project.
Adani Group intends to implement Acetylene and Carbide based PVC production processes for the
Mundra project
. The environment clearance and consent to establish the project have already been received.
After polyethylene and polypropylene, PVC is the third most produced synthetic plastic polymer worldwide. By 2027, India is predicted to be the nation adding the most polyvinyl chloride capacity, followed by China and the US. The construction and agriculture sectors are seen driving the PVC demand in India.
The increasing government spending on housing, sanitation and irrigation through programmes like PMKSY, AMRUT and Housing for All are driving the demand for pipes and tubes, sources said adding PVC demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8-10 per cent between fiscal years 2023 and 2026 as a result of increased infrastructure spending and various government initiatives.

Haldia Petrochemicals seeks local Indian naphtha supplies amid Red Sea disruption: CEO,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/petrochem/haldia-petrochemicals-seeks-local-indian-naphtha-supplies-amid-red-sea-disruption-ceo/articleshow/108826904.cms,27-03-2024,"India's
Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd
is looking to source feedstock
naphtha
from domestic refiners to shield itself from volatile shipping costs triggered by ship attacks in the
Red Sea
, the company's chief executive officer said on Wednesday.
The company, which owns a naphtha cracker producing 700,000 metric tons per year in the eastern state of West Bengal, sources 50% of its
feedstock
from the
Middle East
and relies on local refiners like
Indian Oil
,
HPCL
and
BPCL
for the rest of its feedstock needs.
While freight costs have now come off highs after spiking 30-40%, there is no certainty that costs will not rise again in the next 12 months, HPL's
CEO
Navanit Narayan told Reuters.
""It adds a lot of volatility to our imports and we are looking at domestic markets for buying feedstock,"" he added.
Clean Petroleum Product (CPP) tanker rates on the Middle East to Asia route have come down to about $70-$90 per metric ton in last week of March, compared with about $110 per ton earlier this year, trade sources said.

Narayan said the company uses lighter grades of naphtha as feedstock and that makes it difficult to buy in large amounts from local refiners who process Russian crude.
Naphtha produced from Russian crude is slightly heavier, while Middle East producers like Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) supply high quality light naphtha, he added.
On petrochemical margins, Narayan said overcapacity globally is weighing on profits even though demand for petrochemicals like paints and pipes is stable compared with last year.
He expects petrochemical margins in India to recover after the first quarter in 2025.
While the company exported some of its polymers to South East Asia and Africa earlier this year, he said, export margins are not as lucrative at present.
""A lot of it depends on recovery in the Chinese economy... also, the problem is a lot of petrochemicals in Europe and Asia which rely on old technologies are not shutting down,"" he said.
The industry as a whole will perform better if consolidation occurs in next two or four years as is already happening in Japan, Narayan added.

Nayara Energy to start PP plant in first half of 2024,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/petrochem/nayara-energy-to-start-pp-plant-in-first-half-of-2024/articleshow/105842314.cms,08-12-2023,"Nayara Energy
, India's second-largest private oil firm, on Friday said it will start operations of a new
polypropylene
plant in the first half of next year, marking its entry into the lucrative petrochemical sector. In the last financial year (April 2022 to March 2023), India's consumption of polypropylene stood at 6.4 million tonnes, of which around 1.6 million tonnes or around 25 per cent was imported.
With wide applications in segments like
packaging
, automotive applications, consumer durables and lifestyle products, the demand for polypropylene (PP) is projected to rise.
""Nayara is well on track for its entry into the petrochemicals sector with its upcoming 4,50,000 tonnes per annum polypropylene plant expected to be commercially operational during H1 2024 - when Nayara expects the demand to accelerate and margins to kick in,"" the firm said.
As India's
GDP
grows, the demand for polypropylene is expected to grow to around 7.5 million tonnes in the next two years, creating sufficient room for new and upcoming domestic capacities.
Nayara said it will be the first polypropylene (PP) producer in the country using the latest phthalate-free catalyst for the entire PP production. Phthalate-free grades will provide cleaner PP for
pharma
, health and hygiene applications.
Live Events
""Our customers are also expected to achieve higher throughput, quality consistency and smooth processing with our PP grades produced using advanced catalyst and technology platform,"" it said. ""We will be packaging our products in pilferage-contamination proof HDSS bags. Our customers will also have the advantage of our all-India sales distribution network and strong technical support. We believe it will be the best product in India for food applications.""
Presently, refinery-based PP economics are lower due to strong fuel cracks and lower PP prices (which have fallen significantly in the last 18 months).
This is the cyclical nature of the business and the long-term prospects of the industry remain bright.
Importantly, integrated refineries with Petchem portfolios are expected to achieve margin resilience through business cycles as compared to standalone refiners.
""At the same time, we are actively considering increasing investment in the India growth story, especially in the petchem sector,"" Nayara said.
With its strategically located refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, which is the largest petrochemical consumption region in the country, the company is positioned to make a strong entry into this high growth segment.
Nayara operates a 20 million tonnes a year oil refinery at Vadinar and also has more than 6,500 petrol pumps in the country. It delivers about 8 per cent of India's refining output.

Petronet LNG defends petchem diversification plan after shares fall 8.5%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/petrochem/petronet-lng-defends-petchem-diversification-plan-after-shares-fall-8-5/articleshow/104828829.cms,30-10-2023,"Petronet LNG
has defended the decision to diversify into petrochemicals after its shares fell 8.5% on Monday, with its CEO saying the Rs 21,000 crore-project would be profitable and ""substantially improve” the finances of the firm.
Petronet’s board on Monday gave a green signal to a plan to set up a
petrochemical plant
as well as propane and ethane handling facilities at Dahej in Gujarat, which already has its largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal.
“The market should not have any apprehension about its profitability,” Petronet LNG’s CEO A K Singh told a news conference. The project would have an internal rate of return of 19%, he added. Investors have been concerned about the returns in the petrochemicals industry given the margin squeeze witnessed in recent times.
Singh said the project has ‘very little chance of delay’ and will benefit from the petrochemicals supply shortfall in the country.
Petronet LNG
reported a 10% year-on-year rise in the July-September quarter to Rs 818 crore on increased utilization at its import terminals. Utilization at its regasification terminal at Dahej rose above 90% in the September quarter from under 80% last year. The company's quarterly revenues fell 22% year-on-year on lower gas prices.

The auditors again flagged the persistent issue of non-receipt of money from customers under use or pay charges. Petronet has booked income towards use or pay charges of Rs 849 crore and Rs 416 crore in the financial year 2022-23 and 2021-22 respectively on account of lower capacity utilization by its customers, the auditors pointed out in the earnings statement. “The balance confirmation / payment against the same is yet to be received,” it added.
Petronet LNG is yet to finalise the renewal of its long-term LNG purchase contract with Qatar, Singh said. A decision on renewal needs to be taken by December 2023, according to the provision of the 25-year purchase contract, which expires in 2028.
Petronet’s shares closed 8.5% lower at Rs 201.7 apiece on Monday when the benchmark Sensex closed 0.5% higher.

""There is a potential investment opportunity of USD 30 billion in next decade in petrochemical sector. And the government of India is proactively addressing the present challenges and implementing several flagship initiatives to improve the overall competitiveness quality and output of the industry,"" he said.
Stating that this sector supports the Prime Minister's initiative of '
Make in India
' and make for the world, Puri said that the chemical and petrochemicals sector can transform India into a global manufacturing hub.
""India today is not only the sixth largest chemical producer in the world, and the fourth in Asia, but also exports chemicals to more than 175 countries. It accounts for 13 per cent of India's total exports,"" he added.
The minister noted that the growth of the petrochemical industry in India has been driven by several factors, including increasing demand for such products from a growing population and a rapidly expanding economy.
""As more and more people in India move into the middle class, they are demanding a wide range of products, many of which are made using petrochemicals,"" he said.
Further, Puri said that Indian petrochemical industry has come a long way from the inception in the 1970s and is poised for transformational growth.
""It is expected to contribute almost 10 per cent of incremental growth in the global petrochemical demand in the coming years,"" he added.
The minister highlighted some policy changes that have been made to boost the sector and improve the ease of doing business, including 100 per cent FDI through automatic routes, Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) and set up of infrastructure such as 10-plus plastic parks, etc.
""The proposed new PCPIR policy will be implemented between 2020-35 and is expected to attract an approximate combined investment of over Rs 34 lakh crore..,"" he said.
Puri pointed out that India's import dependency on petrochemical intermediaries is a staggering 45 per cent, one of the highest in the manufacturing industry.
India currently is a net importer of all major petrochemicals except for benzene and polyester chips, he added.
""The Indian chemical sector continues to grow at a rate of 1.2-1.5 times the GDP and if you look at the Indian GDP growth, this is not insignificant. I would say it's a commendable growth,"" the minister said.
About 80 per cent of India's petrochemicals capacity is integrated with petroleum refineries, he said.
""This gives an edge in terms of petrochemical feedstock certainty, we are increasing our refining capacity from 215 million metric tonnes per annum in 2013-14 to 251.2 million metric tonnes per annum, the fourth largest in the world, after the United States, China and Russia.
""We have plans in place to take this from 252 million metric tonnes per annum to nearly 450 million metric tonnes per annum,"" Puri said.
