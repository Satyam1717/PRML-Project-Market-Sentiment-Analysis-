Kosi Mechi Intra-State Link Project
under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana-Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (
PMKSY-AIBP
) to enhance irrigation and flood management in the region. The project envisages diversion of a part of surplus Kosi water for extending irrigation to Mahananda basin in Bihar by way of remodelling existing Eastern Kosi Main Canal.
Estimated to cost Rs. 6,282.32 crore, the project includes Rs 3,652.56 crore as central assistance to Bihar and is scheduled for completion by March 2029.
Responding to a question during a media briefing after a Cabinet meeting, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said discussions with Nepal have taken place about the project and it is expected to have a major impact on
flood management in Bihar
.
Asked whether more such projects would be announced ahead of elections in Bihar, he said decisions were being made ""for the entire country"".
The Kosi Mechi Intra-State Link Project aims to divert excess water from the Kosi River to the Mahananda basin in Bihar. This will be achieved through the remodelling of the Eastern Kosi Main Canal (EKMC) up to 41.30 km and its extension to the Mechi River at 117.50 km.

Once completed, the project aims to provide additional irrigation to 2,10,516 hectares of farmland in Araria, Purnea, Kishanganj, and Katihar districts during the Kharif season.
It will also restore the shortfall supply to 1.57 lakh hectares currently irrigated by the existing EKMC system. Additionally, about 2,050 million cubic meters of surplus water from Kosi will be diverted to the Mahananda command area during monsoons.
The project is part of the broader PMKSY-AIBP initiative, which was launched in 2015-16 to expand irrigation coverage and improve water conservation efforts.
The scheme's Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme component focuses on major and medium irrigation projects, with the aim of ensuring water access for farmers.
Since April 2016, 63 projects have been completed under PMKSY-AIBP, creating
additional irrigation potential
for 26.11 lakh hectares. The Kosi Mechi project is the tenth to be included in the AIBP component since 2021.

Bharatmala Pariyojana Scheme
, have faced delays primarily due to factors like
land acquisition issues
and financial difficulties faced by contractors, Parliament was informed Wednesday. Besides force majeure events, scarcity of construction materials, etc have also caused delays in the projects, Union Minister for Road, Transport and Highways
Nitin Gadkari
said in a reply to Rajya Sabha.
""The implementation of 637 projects, including those under the Bharatmala Pariyojana Scheme, has faced delays...,"" the Minister said.
To overcome these challenges and expedite project execution, the government has undertaken various initiatives, Gadkari said..
These include streamlining and expediting land acquisition process, revamping Parivesh Portal to facilitate faster forest and environmental clearances, enabling online approval of General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) of Road Over Bridge/Road Under Bridge (ROB/RUB) from the Railways, and conducting review meetings at various levels with all stakeholders, including state governments, he said.
On the financial implication, Gadkari said it does not arise in every delayed project. The minister said if delay is not attributable to the contractor, price escalation is paid as per contract conditions, which may or may not result in additional cost, depending upon final value of price escalation determined on actual completion of the project.

While Rs 8,340 crore were raised in unit capital from domestic and international investors, Rs 10,040 crore was raised in debt from domestic lenders, the ministry of road transport and highways said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
The National Highways Infra Trust (
NHIT
), the
Infrastructure Investment Trust
(InvIT), was set up by NHAI in 2020 to support the government asset monetization programme.
According to the statement, for the first time the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has invested Rs 2,035 crore in InvIT.

“The issue attracted strong demand from both existing and new investors,” it said, adding that NHAI also subscribed to its share of 15% of the units at the same price.
The other domestic pension and provident funds that invested in the fourth round of InvIT included L&T Provident Fund, the Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Karamchari PF and the Indian Oil Corporation PF.
From the insurance sector, Axis Max Life Insurance invested in the InvIT while NaBFID,

Private capex share dipped to decadal low of 33% in FY24: ICRA,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/private-capex-share-dipped-to-decadal-low-of-33-in-fy24-icra/articleshow/119421235.cms,24-03-2025,"Domestic rating agency
ICRA
on Monday said private capital expenditure's share in the overall investments in the economy dipped to a decadal low of 33 per cent in FY24. Among the
private companies
, it was the unlisted players which were subdued in investments as compared to the listed entities, as per a report.
It can be noted that for the last few years, the government has been driving investments, leading to concerns in some quarters over the private sector's absence and its impact on the overall economic activity.
The private sector has instead focused on deploying excess cash at reducing loan burdens rather than investing in new facilities, choosing to run at high capacity utilisation.
""Weak domestic consumption, especially urban, muted export demand, and the influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors, among other factors, restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporates,"" the agency's chief rating officer K Ravichandran said.
Illustrating the importance of investments in the economy, the agency said Gross Fixed Capital Formation (
GFCF
), encompassing the gross addition to fixed assets and intangibles, constitutes around 30 per cent of India's nominal GDP, making it the second largest component after private final consumption expenditure.
Live Events
The GFCF has been slowing down since FY23, largely due to the slowdown in the private sector's activity, the agency said, adding that government
capex
and household investments in real estate have helped it.
The listed corporates increased their capex spending by 28 per cent in FY23 and 12 per cent in FY24, but the unlisted entities experienced a contraction in FY24, dragging overall
private capex
growth, the agency said.
The cash generation of corporates has consistently improved, post the Covid shock, with the ratio of cash flow from operations vis-a-vis capex increasing to 1.6 times in FY2024 from an average of 1.3 times from FY2014 to FY2020. This has also led to a steady reduction in gearing levels to 0.9 times in FY2024 from 1.1 times in FY2014, it said.
""Deleveraged corporate balance sheets, together with improving cash flows from operations, point towards favourable conditions for an upturn in the private capex cycle,"" Ravichandran said, adding RBI's rate cuts, and income tax relief in the budget could help the process.

On the elevated highway over Kaziranga National Park, he said, ""We don't have any fund problem. We manage national highway in such a way that we have got the highest reputation in the capital market"". The project will start soon after getting the Cabinet approval.
Replying to a question by Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge regarding connectivity between Gulbarga and Bengaluru, Gadkari said the Modi government has done a lot of work in Karnataka since 2014.
The minister also asked the Congress President to provide him with a list of work that needs to be done in Karnataka, and he will look into it.
Gadkari pointed out that there has been a problem with land acquisition and environment clearance in Karnataka.
While asking questions, Kharge also said that he has heard that even files related to the allocation of numbers to national highways go to the Prime Minister's Office.
To this, the minister replied: ""I want to inform Kharge Ji that files on the allocation of numbers do not go to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has appointed me and my department works as per the mandate given. There are no obstacles"".
Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar also made a special request to Gadkari.
""It is my great fortune that I was born in Tithana village of Haryana and I did my schooling there too. It is a request that Union Minister Nitin Gadkari should consider that the area should be connected with a national highway. It will benefit the people travelling to Delhi greatly,"" Dhankhar said.
Gadkari responded in affirmative to the request.

Land for highways left unused for 5 years will be returned; govt's new rules aim to clear roadblocks,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/land-left-unused-for-5-years-will-be-returned-govts-new-rules-aim-to-clear-roadblocks/articleshow/119106255.cms,17-03-2025,"The Central government has proposed that land parcels acquired for
highway development
be returned to their original owners if they remain unused for five years, reported TOI.
Additionally, landowners and the highway authority will no longer be able to challenge the compensation amount for the acquired land three months after the announcement of the award.
According to the TOI report, these are part of the key provisions outlined by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in its proposal to amend the
National Highways Act
, which has been sent to the cabinet for approval.
The proposed amendments aim to speed up land acquisition for national highway development and
wayside amenities
while reducing the need for arbitration, TOI reported citing sources.
One of the key changes would allow the government to declare any interchange of a highway with other transportation modes, such as rail or air, as part of the national highway network. This provision is intended to address both current and future needs.
Live Events
Moreover, various ministries, including Civil Aviation, Railways, Defence, Shipping, Coal, Environment, Legal Affairs, and Revenue, have provided feedback on the proposed amendments, said TOI.
The government also plans to create a designated portal for publishing notices related to land acquisition, facilitating the process for acquiring land for wayside amenities, public utilities, tolls, and highway operation offices.
Meanwhile, in a bid to prevent any potential disputes, the Ministry of Highways has proposed that no transactions or encumbrances be allowed on land once the government issues a notification for its acquisition until the process is complete, reported TOI.
This measure comes in response to cases where landowners built houses or started businesses on the land after the first notification in an attempt to secure higher compensation.
Moreover, the amendments clarify that arbitrators determining compensation will have to base their decision on the market value of the land on the date of the initial notification. This change is intended to prevent arbitrary compensation awards.
TOI sources also revealed that the proposed amendments set clear timelines for determining compensation, filing objections, and setting parameters for arbitrators, all aimed at enhancing transparency in the land acquisition process for highway development.

"Grant of Rs 8,000 crore to develop 8 greenfield cities unutilised, may lapse",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/grant-of-rs-8000-crore-to-develop-8-greenfield-cities-unutilised-may-lapse/articleshow/118901069.cms,11-03-2025,"₹8,000 crore to develop eight new greenfield cities in a year -- this is the task before the ministry of housing and urban affairs which is yet to finalise the new cities to be incubated.
In 2021, the
Fifteenth Finance Commission
had allocated a grant of ₹8,000 crore as
performance-based challenge fund
to incubate eight new greenfield cities in five years. Though the process for choosing the eight new centres to be developed was completed in 2023, the ministry of housing and urban affairs has not finalised the names. This grant will lapse on March 31, 2026.
After the Finance Commission announced the grant, the ministry of housing and urban affairs constituted an expert committee for finalisation of the bid parameters for incubation of new cities. The committee finalised minimum eligibility conditions and bid parameters and a Request for Proposal (RfP) was circulated to all states. The ministry received 26 proposals from 21 states by January 2023. However, the ministry decided to give another opportunity to the North East states and revised proposals were sought. Finally, two more proposals were added. The final list before the ministry is 28 proposals from 23 states. Even if the new incubation centres are chosen now, officials say it will be difficult to utilise the grant money fully in just one year. ""It is extremely difficult for a state to spend ₹1,000 crore in a year to incubate a new city. There are several challenges, including land acquisition and clearances to set up a new city. Something else will need to be worked out to ensure that this grant is utilised."" One of the options could be to discuss the proposal with the Sixteenth Finance Commission and then earmark another grant for the new cities.
The Centre wants to encourage the North East and hill states for incubating new cities. The official quoted above said, ""There could be more than eight cities as the government wants to encourage the NE states. Since they do not have the capacity to absorb ₹1,000 crore, the Centre may split the amount and choose two centres in the North East states and give ₹500 crore each.""
To give impetus to the proposals from the North East and hill states, the ministry had relaxed the preferred size and population criteria. The preferred size of the proposed cities in the North East and hill states is ""more than 25 hectares"" and for all other states is ""more than 50 hectares"". Similarly, the envisaged population of the new city is 25,000 for the NE states and 1,00,000 for other states. In December 2024, in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for ministry of housing and urban affairs Tokhan Sahu had said, ""All the proposals are at the competent level for examination/scrutiny.""

ADB commits $200 million loan to expand urban services in Kolkata,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/adb-commits-200-million-loan-to-expand-urban-services-in-kolkata/articleshow/118603851.cms,27-02-2025,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a USD 200 million loan to enhance the development of climate-and disaster-resilient sewerage and drainage infrastructure in Kolkata, aiming to improve the city's livability. These interventions, which are part of the
Kolkata Municipal Corporation
Sustainability, Hygiene, and Resilience (Sector) Project, will improve the living conditions and health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable groups including women and children, ADB said in a statement.
Kolkata, one of India's most populous and densely populated cities, faces significant challenges due to inadequate drainage and sewerage systems, causing urban floods and an unhygienic environment, it said.
These issues are exacerbated by increased heavy rains due to climate change, it said.
To address these challenges, the project will construct 84 kilometers (km) of combined trunk and secondary sewerage and drainage pipelines, 176 km of combined lateral sewerage and drainage pipelines up to customer connections, and 50,000 household sewer connections, it said.
It will construct one sewage treatment plant and five pumping stations. The project will benefit over 277,000 residents, it added.

Centre examining big-ticket projects over cost overrun,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/centre-examining-big-ticket-projects-over-cost-overrun/articleshow/118585671.cms,26-02-2025,"The construction of the new Vice-President Enclave in the heart of New Delhi was bid out for ₹189.16 crore and had to be completed by November 2022. But the big-ticket project was completed almost two years later, in June 2024 and with a 51% cost overrun.
The works related to shifting of tourism and skill development ministries at Jodhpur Officers Hostel were tendered at ₹7.94 crore with a targeted date of completion of February 2023. This project saw a 142% cost overrun with the final bill at ₹19.26 crore and a time overrun of five months.
In the run-up to 2022 Republic Day parade, the work for 3D projection mapping on North block and South block buildings was given out at a cost of ₹2.32 crore but the completion cost saw a 33.48% overrun at ₹3.10 crore.
The work of external development of two-side roads outside the Vice-President Enclave was tendered out at a cost of ₹5.71 crore but the final bill came with an almost 19% cost overrun and a five-month delay.
Hit by time and cost overruns in urban development projects like these, the Centre has started examining big-ticket projects initiated across India to investigate the reasons for escalations and how these can be curbed.
Live Events
The
Central Public Works Department
, the primary construction arm of the government, has asked all its divisions to prepare reports with details of projects with a tendered cost of over ₹1 crore and initiated after 2020. The government is now looking at what was the expected cost of the project, if it was tendered out at a lower cost, how low was the tendered cost, the final completion cost, different heads where there was cost escalation, stipulated date of completion and the time overrun.
Though the exercise is incomplete yet, the initial reports have thrown staggering statistics. The biggest challenge is that the contractors try to outbid each other by quoting very low costs. Take for instance, the finishing work of the subterranean tunnel in Vice-President's Enclave. The government expected to bid out the project at ₹3.85 crore but the tendered cost was 38% lower at ₹2.78 crore. The government expected the construction work of the same tunnel to cost ₹21.31 crore but the tendered cost was ₹18.31 crore and the final completion cost was almost ₹20 crore - closer to government's initial estimates.
A government source told ET, ""There is stiff competition among contractors and this is why the tendered cost is very low. There are now complaints of poor quality of work and time and cost overruns. Here cost overruns are important because the projects were taken at very low rates to beat competition.""

Addressing the gathering in Guwahati during the investors' summit, Advantage Assam 2.0 Investment & Infrastructure Summit 2025, Ambani emphasized Reliance's long-term commitment to the state's development, particularly in the technology and digital sectors.
""In the coming years, Reliance will more than quadruple its investment in Assam to over Rs 50,000 crore,"" Ambani stated.
He recalled the company's earlier commitment of Rs 5,000 crore in the 2018 summit and highlighted that Reliance has since exceeded Rs 12,000 crore in investments in the state.
Ambani highlighted Reliance's priority of making Assam ""tech-ready and AI-ready,"" calling the state's digital transformation a ""noble and patriotic mission.""

He noted that Jio has played an important role in modernizing Assam's telecom infrastructure, making it ""not only 2G-mukt but 5G-yukt"" (free from 2G and empowered with 5G). He expressed gratitude to the people of Assam for embracing Jio wholeheartedly.
Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, Ambani stated that the summit's theme, Advantage Assam, reflects the transformation the state has undergone under Modi's governance. He identified four key advantages that Modi has brought to Assam.
""In the past 11 years you have brought four unique advantages to Assam. Advantage one, you have brought Assam and the rest of northeast from the periphery to the center of India's development map. You have yourself visited the northeast over 70 times more than any other prime minister in the past,"" Ambani said, pointing out that the Prime Minister has visited the region more than 70 times--more than any other previous leader.
""Second, you have given Assam an inspiring new mantra: Act East, Act Fast, and Act First,"" he said, adding that Assam has the potential to develop so rapidly that Southeast Asia and East Asia will begin looking towards the state as a hub of growth opportunities.
The third advantage, Ambani noted, is the ""unprecedented connectivity revolution"" in Assam and the Northeast, which goes beyond physical and digital connectivity to also include developmental and emotional connectivity with the rest of India.
The fourth and most significant advantage, he added, is the emphasis on technology as a key driver of development. Comparing Assam's global reputation as a tea paradise, Ambani expressed confidence that in the coming decades, the state will also emerge as a ""technological paradise.""
With Reliance's massive new investment commitment, Assam is poised to see significant growth in digital infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and overall economic development in the years ahead.

NHAI identifies 24 road assets to be monetised in 2025-26,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/nhai-identifies-24-road-assets-to-be-monetised-in-2025-26/articleshow/118535988.cms,24-02-2025,"The
National Highways Authority of India
(NHAI) has drawn up a tentative list of 24 road assets to be monetised in 2025-26 and has sought comments from the stakeholders to firm up a comprehensive list.
The total length of the roads assets to be monetised in the coming financial year is 1,472 km with a cumulative annual revenue from these assets pegged at Rs 1,863 crore in 2023-24.
“These assets are preferably to be montised through
toll-operate-transfer
(
TOT
) mode unless not revised at a later stage for any other mode of monetisation,” NHAI, which is the administrative control of the
ministry of road transport and highways
, said in an office order dated February 24, 2025.
As per the order, out of the 24 projects, five road projects are in Maharashtra, four in Jharkhand, three in Uttar Pradesh, two each in West Bengal, Bihar and Telangana and one each in Chattisgarh, Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala and Odisha.
The target for 2025-26 is lower when compared to 2024-25 when NHAI had identified 33 highway stretches with a total length of 2741 km across the country for monetisation.

NHAI is adopting three modes for monetizing, i.e. toll-operate-transfer (TOT), InvIT and securitization. Under toll-operate-transfer (TOT) mode, the right of collection of fees for selected operational national highway projects constructed through public funding is assigned to a concessionaire against upfront payment of a lump-sum amount to NHAI.
MoRTH has targeted to raise Rs 39,000 crore through various modes of asset monetisation in 2024-25. “Out of this, a concession agreement for TOT Bundle-16 (251 km) amounting to Rs 6,661 crore has already been signed in November 2024,” it said in its annual report 2024-25.

Montek Singh Ahluwalia
on Wednesday argued in favour of splitting large states like Uttar Pradesh to give a new impetus to
urbanisation
. He also suggested picking up some
tier-2 towns
and developing them into ""near-Metros"".
The former deputy chairman of the erstwhile planning commission shared his views at a fireside chat with economist Salman Anees Soz on ""Resilient Pathways: Charting Economic Growth Amid Global Challenges"" at the Global Investors' Meet here.
""We should seriously consider cutting down many of the larger states into two or three,"" he said.
He recalled that former UP CM and BSP leader Mayawati had suggested splitting her State into three. Had this been done, there would have been a political willingness instantly to create three new good cities, according to him. People have said this could be done in many other states. In Maharashtra, for example, there are people who said that the Vidarbha region should be made a separate state with Nagpur as its capital.
He acknowledged that interesting reforms and tough decisions such as this are not politically easy. Ahluwalia also noted that all our States are highly centralised.
Live Events
There is evidence to suggest that performance of new states has improved, he said.
Responding to a question on rising public debt, he said the States have all become fiscally very weak because of the scale of debt relative to both revenue generation and their gross domestic product is too high.
The nature of reforms needed for India to achieve 8% annual growth for two decades to realise its vision of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047 have not been clearly spelt out and said there are some challenges to achieve this goal. If India is to grow at 8% then the urban population has to grow very rapidly, he said.
Earlier in 1991, initiating reforms was easy because the world was speaking one language.
""We started the reforms after Eastern Europe had abolished communism…there was only one thing to do which was integrating with the global market. That has become much more complex now.""
Geopolitical tensions are now rising, the US has its own problems not only with its closest allies, like Canada and Mexico, but also with China. China is cozying up to Russia. Russia is becoming more dependent on China. Europeans are very scared of Russia. They are not so bothered about China. ""India is faced with a world that is now fragmented. We didn't have that problem in 1991 at all.""
Gandhiji had said India lives in its villages. and many people still regard that as a sort of romantic vision, he said. ""I think you have to recognise that India will not be 'viksit' if it does not largely reduce the numbers staying in villages."" Good Gandhians should recognise that this is not undermining the views of Mahatma Gandhi, who expressed these views 100 years ago but did not mean that it will continue to do so 100 years later, Ahluwalia said.

Addressing a press conference to highlight various provisions made in the recently-presented Union Budget, he said the budget will make India self-reliant and aims to establish it as a 'Vishwaguru' (world leader) by 2047.
""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always said that he considers poor, farmers, women and youth as the only four castes in our country, and this budget focuses on these four categories,"" he said. ""In the last one year, Rs 11 lakh crore have been spent on infrastructure.
The UPA used to spend only Rs 2 lakh crore on this front,"" the Minister of Communications said. According to him, railway lines of 2,031 km were laid and 6,000 km-long national highways were constructed in the past one year. In the telecom sector, towers have been installed across 10,700 villages to improve connectivity, he said.
""In the past, 90 per cent phones in India used to be imported. Now, 90 per cent phones are being manufactured in India and units of Rs 1.28 lakh crore are being exported,"" he said.

India's exports have gone up to USD 600 billion and the foreign exchange reserves are pegged at USD 705 billion.
The country has the fourth largest foreign exchange reserves in the whole world, the minister said. ""There has been a 3.5 per cent growth in the agriculture sector and Madhya Pradesh has made the highest contribution, which has grown by 6.5 per cent,"" he said.
""Our aim is that India becomes the third largest economy by 2027,"" Scindia said. India will leave behind Germany and Japan in the next two years. The target is that India will be a USD 5 trillion economy by 2028 and USD 6 trillion by 2030, he added.
Nowhere else in the world one will find an establishment like the Indian Postal Department, which has 1.64 lakh post offices and four lakh postmen. These offices will be converted into logistics centres, he said, adding that the postal departments of many countries have been studied.
Scindia said that the postal department will provide services like parcels and e-commerce.
Along with this, 2.45 lakh gram panchayats in the country are being connected through BharatNet. Currently, 2.12 lakh gram panchayats are connected and the rest will also be linked in a similar way. An amount of Rs 1.39 lakh crore has been allocated for this, he said. BharatNet is an ambitious project of the central government to provide broadband connectivity to all village panchayats in the country.
According to Scindia, the budget has provided relief to the middle class as individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh will not have to pay income tax.

FY25 target to fund projects via green bonds pruned 27%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/fy25-target-to-fund-projects-via-green-bonds-pruned-27/articleshow/117924856.cms,04-02-2025,"The government has cut its FY25 target for financing projects and schemes through the green bond proceeds by 27% from the budget estimate and intends to maintain this level next fiscal as well amid muted investor appetite, a senior official said.
Sovereign
green bonds
debuted in FY23 to signal the government's increased commitment to deepen the country's green financing market. It was also part of the broader efforts to reduce the country's carbon footprint and contribute to its ambitious 2070
net zero emissions
target.
The revised financing target for FY25 has been curtailed to ₹25,298 crore from the budget estimate of ₹32,061 crore. For the next fiscal, the government intends to use the funds mobilised via such bonds on projects worth ₹25,342 crore, the official said, citing the finance ministry's expenditure plan for FY26.
This means the green bond issuance in the next fiscal would be around the same level as in FY25. The government decides on the issue size of green bonds just when it finalises its borrowing plan for the next fiscal. But the funding requirement for the earmarked projects indicates the bond issuance size. The funding needs have been prepared based on proposals submitted by various ministries.
Inadequate
greenium
Live Events
However, while the government raised ₹16,000 crore in FY23 and ₹20,000 crore in FY24, the bonds barely attracted the so-called ""greenium""-the premium over the borrowing cost of similar non-green instruments-that it expected. The official said the greenium has been negligible since FY23.
This is a disincentive for the government, which has to deploy resources to ensure that the proceeds raised via this route are spent only on green projects.
Project allocations
Railways account for close to 60% of the proposed spending on green projects for the next fiscal, followed by new and renewable energy (almost 21%) and housing & urban affairs (20%).
The government's annual budgetary spending on green projects across sectors would far exceed this level. But such expenditures are not strictly segregated and classified as per the environment-friendly nature of the projects.

Highways move into the slow lane: Construction pace likely to dip due to fewer project awards in the last two fiscals,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/highways-move-into-the-slow-lane-construction-pace-likely-to-dip-due-to-fewer-project-awards-in-the-last-two-fiscals/articleshow/117884497.cms,03-02-2025,"The government is expected to witness a slowdown in
highway construction
over the next two years due to a decline in new project awards in 2023-24 and the current financial year. However, the road transport ministry remains optimistic about surpassing the 10,400 km construction target for the ongoing fiscal year, a TOI report stated.
Project Completion and Current Progress
It generally takes at least two years for a highway project to be completed after the awarding of contracts. According to TOI sources, the ministry is aiming to reach 11,000 km in highway construction this year, as around 7,000 km has already been built. The pace of construction is traditionally higher during February and March. However, sustaining this momentum beyond this fiscal year may be challenging due to a reduction in project awards.
A source stated, “But maintaining this pace for the next two years will be difficult as the projects under implementation have reduced with bidding out of fewer projects.”
Project Awards and Revised Targets
By the third week of January, around 4,100 km of
national highway projects
had been awarded, slightly higher than last year’s figures. The ministry has now revised its bidding target to approximately 8,000 km. Officials expressed confidence in surpassing the previous year’s total of 8,581 km, citing recent approvals of multiple projects.
The government had awarded 10,964 km in 2020-21, which increased to 12,731 km in 2021-22. In the 2022-23 financial year, the total stood at 12,379 km.
Live Events
Reasons for the Slowdown
The slowdown in awarding new highway projects is attributed to government directives restricting fresh approvals under the ‘Bharatmala’ programme. Additionally, no new highway development initiatives have been introduced.
Meanwhile, an inter-ministerial panel responsible for reviewing major highway projects has recommended that the ministry accept bids only after acquiring 80%-90% of the required land and obtaining statutory clearances such as environmental and forest approvals. Officials acknowledged that this requirement could slow down project approvals but would help prevent delays, cost overruns, and legal disputes.
Land Acquisition Requirements for Different Project Models
Under the hybrid annuity model (HAM), where private players contribute 60% of the investment, agencies must secure 80% of the required land before beginning construction. For projects under the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model—where the government bears the full project cost—90% of the land must be acquired before the bidding process.
The ministry is now focused on ensuring land acquisition and regulatory clearances before project allocation to avoid future complications.

Infrastructure capex is up 10%; govt to rope in private companies for partnerships; to double down on execution,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/infrastructure-capex-is-up-10-govt-to-rope-in-private-companies-for-partnerships-to-double-down-on-execution/articleshow/117841716.cms,02-02-2025,"Public-private partnerships
(PPPs) are back in vogue as the budget seeks to encourage India Inc to start spending on
infrastructure projects
. The push is backed by a 10% hike in
capital expenditure
to `11.21 lakh crore for FY26.
The establishment of a mechanism for speedier implementation of PPP projects is also an indication along these lines as the Centre rationalises spends to ensure fiscal prudence.
To be sure, the FY26 capex goal is 0.9% higher than the budgetary estimate (BE) of 11.11 lakh crore earmarked for FY25. Since key
infrastructure ministries
were unable to meet these targets, the allocation was lowered to 10.18 lakh crore in the revised estimate (RE) for the current fiscal year.
Capex allocation for roads has been kept at 2.72 lakh crore for FY26, roughly the same as in FY25. For Indian Railways as well, the budgetary allocation for capex is little changed at 2.52 lakh crore.
“Although the government's capital expenditure allocation has increased moderately, the emphasis is likely to shift towards effective implementation through the PPP model,” India Ratings & Research director Vishal Kotecha said on the change in approach.
Live Events
This is evident from initiatives aimed at creating a three-year pipeline of projects, annual
monetisation plan
and access to
PM Gati Shakti data
, ensuring a steady stream of investments and timely execution.
In her budget speech, finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said each infrastructure-related ministry will come up with a three-year pipeline of projects that can be implemented in PPP mode. States will also be encouraged to do so and can seek support from the
India Infrastructure Project Development Fund
scheme to prepare PPP proposals, she added.
Sitharaman said the government will also set up an Urban Challenge Fund of 1 lakh crore to implement proposals for “cities as growth hubs.”
“This fund will finance up to 25% of the cost of bankable projects with a stipulation that at least 50% of the cost is funded from bonds, bank loans and PPPs,” she said, adding an allocation of `10,000 crore is proposed for FY26.

, a new fund for urban infrastructure, and credit enhancement were among the measures announced in the budget on Saturday, potentially freeing up bank credit and giving insurance and pension funds a new avenue for investments.
An outlay of ₹1.5 lakh crore for 50-year interest-free loans to states for capital expenditure and an
Urban Challenge Fund
(UCF) of ₹1 lakh crore were announced.
The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure & Development (NaBFID) has been allowed to set up a partial credit enhancement facility for corporate bonds for infrastructure.
The UCF, meanwhile, will finance up to 25% of the cost of bankable projects with a stipulation that at least 50% of the cost is funded from bonds, bank loans and public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Live Events
""This will help us provide a first-loss guarantee of up to 20% of the loan while improving the project's rating. Most of the completed infrastructure projects are rated 'A' today, but after this credit enhancement, the rating could improve to 'AA', qualifying them to seek investments from long-term insurance and pension funds,"" NaBFID managing director Rajkiran Rai said.
Banks and development finance institutions (DFIs) provide credit enhancement for a fee typically between 1% and 2% of the loan. A higher rating due to the first loss guarantee allows the bonds to be priced at a lower yield than a loan, benefiting both the borrower and simultaneously deleveraging bank exposure.
Rai said NaBFID is in discussions with the central bank to ease some capital requirements that will bring down borrowing costs further.
The proposal of interest-free loans to states will accelerate infrastructure development and boost growth, said Ajay Kumar Srivastava, managing director of
Indian Overseas Bank

PM Gati Shakti portal
to the private sector, a decision which could help them optimize
last-mile delivery services
and develop infrastructure-based applications. PM Gati Shakti national master plan initiative was launched in October 2021 for integrated and planned development of critical infrastructure projects to reduce logistics costs.
""For furthering PPPs (public private partnerships) and assisting the private sector in project planning, access to relevant data and maps from the PM Gati Shakti portal will be provided,"" Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said in her Budget speech.
Using these data layers like track length details, railway stations, DFC (Dedicated Freight Corridor), Good Sheds, national and state highways/ district layers, MMLPs (Multi Modal Logistics Parks), ware houses, existing airports from different ministries will help private sector to optimize last mile delivery services, developing infrastructure-based apps, smart city solutions and tech driven
logistics management
and also enable them for informed decision and better planning in healthcare sector, disaster management, agriculture sector, and food distribution.
All logistics and connectivity infrastructure projects, entailing investment of over Rs 500 crore, route through the network planning group (NPG) constituted under the initiative. A GIS enabled national master plan digital platform has also been developed and over 1,300 data layers are uploaded by the Centre and states on this platform.
Data related to land records, ports, forest, schools, railway stations, water bodies, telecom towers, and highways are available on the portal.
Live Events
For example, if the railway is planning a project on a specified route, so by putting the relevant data/information on the PM Gati Shakti national master plan portal/platform before finalising the DPR (detailed project report), it can see whether the proposed track is crossing through public land or private property or forest or canal or highways and accordingly make changes without visiting the area physically.
The aim is to improve logistics efficiency by reducing the time and cost of transportation, simplifying procedures and creating an efficient logistics ecosystem.
By the use of this platform, the DPRs are getting ready in 2-3 months (including ground truthing). Earlier it used to take 6-8 months through simultaneous visualisation of all relevant details available on the platform.
The minister also announced to start a
National Geospatial Mission
to develop foundational
geospatial infrastructure
and data.
""Using PM Gati Shakti, this Mission will facilitate modernization of land records, urban planning, and design of infrastructure projects,"" she said.
This initiative, according to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) seeks to digitize land records using Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping, enhancing accuracy, bringing in transparency and accessibility.

Need to step up infrastructure investment over the next two decades: Economic Survey 2024-25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/need-to-step-up-infrastructure-investment-over-the-next-two-decades-economic-survey-2024-25/articleshow/117781364.cms,31-01-2025,"India needs a continued step-up of
infrastructure investment
over the next two decades to sustain a high rate of growth, the
Economic Survey
2024-25 said, suggesting a need for accelerating private sector participation in infrastructure creation in the country.
According to the Survey, tabled in Parliament on Friday, India’s infrastructure requirements are aplenty and all this requires greater attention.
“Quite clearly, public sector efforts cannot fully meet these requirements as there are binding
budget
constraints to the different tiers of government,” the Survey said.
“Private participation should accelerate in many critical infrastructure sectors in many ways—programme and project planning, financing, construction, maintenance, monetisation and impact assessment,” it suggested.
Outlining the various initiatives of the government including the availability of multiple ways of infrastructure development, introduction of facilitatory mechanisms like the National Infrastructure Pipeline, National Monetisation Pipeline and PM-Gati Sakti and the financial market reforms, the Survey said that the uptake of private enterprise is limited in many core sectors.

“The strategy to step up private participation needs coordinated action of all stakeholders involved - governments at different tiers, financial market players, project management experts and planners, and the private sector,” it suggested.
According to the Survey, capacities to conceptualise projects, development of sector-specific innovative strategies for execution, and development of high-expertise areas such as risk and revenue sharing, contract management, conflict resolution and project closure need to improve substantially.
“The efforts of the union government would need to be supplemented with wholehearted acceptance of the need for public-private partnerships in infrastructure across the country,” it added.

"Budget 2025: Despite govt capex of Rs 54 Lakh cr over 5 years, concern on pvt investment and employment remain",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/budget-2025-despite-govt-capex-of-rs-54-lakh-cr-over-5-years-concern-on-pvt-investment-and-employment-remain/articleshow/117770246.cms,31-01-2025,"Budget 2025
: The Indian government has spent over Rs 54 lakh crore on capital expenditure in the past 11 years, according to a report by Systematix Institutional Equities.
This includes the budgeted allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for FY25. Despite this massive spending, the report added that the concerns over weak private investment and unemployment persist.
The report also highlighted that Rs 38 lakh crore of the total capital expenditure was allocated after the COVID-19 pandemic. In FY25, capital expenditure will account for 23 per cent of total government spending, reaching levels last seen in FY04. Back then, India experienced one of its strongest nine-year private investment cycles.
However, the current situation is different, as private investment has not picked up, despite the government's heavy spending on infrastructure.
It said ""The worries of lagging private capex and unemployment have persisted since 2012, and in the recent year, as the RBI's KLEMS data and PLFS survey jointly suggest, it has culminated in an unprecedented surge in disguised unemployment and contraction in real wages"".
Live Events
A major concern raised in the report is the lack of a significant multiplier effect from this high capital expenditure. Ideally, large government spending should stimulate private investment and economic growth.
However, the expected boost in private sector investments has not materialized, leading to renewed calls for even higher infrastructure spending ahead of the
Union Budget
.
The report stated that companies have also raised concerns about a shrinking middle-income segment, pointing towards a structural slowdown in India's long-term economic growth.
Over the past decade, the government has focused on two major policy responses to address economic challenges. The first phase involved steps such as resolving bad loans, recapitalizing banks, cutting corporate taxes (in 2019), and improving business conditions through formalization and GST implementation.
When these measures failed to boost private investment, the government introduced a second phase of stimulus--massive infrastructure spending, especially on roads and railways--particularly after the pandemic. Policymakers hoped this would trigger private investment and create a ripple effect on economic growth.
However, the report suggests that this strategy has not delivered the expected results. Instead of driving growth, it has led to a fiscal burden, even though the government has maintained fiscal discipline, reducing the deficit from its peak of 9.2 per cent of GDP in FY21.
As the government prepares for the upcoming Union Budget, the report highlights the challenge of balancing fiscal discipline with the need to stimulate private investment. While the government has adhered to its
fiscal deficit
reduction plan, the lack of a strong response from private investors and worsening employment conditions raise concerns about India's long-term economic prospects.
With growing calls for increased infrastructure spending, policymakers must find ways to make government investments more effective in driving private sector participation and sustainable economic growth.

, which is undergoing a corporate insolvency resolution process.
Investors such as Authum Investment & Infrastructure Ltd, Dickey Alternative Investment Trust and Finquest Financial Solutions Pvt Ltd have also evinced interest in the company, said a person aware of the development. The company has admitted liabilities of over ₹6,647 crore, which includes about ₹3,082 crore from secured financial creditors and ₹3,544 crore from unsecured financial creditors.
Mumbai-based Arshiya provides unified supply chain and integrated

As per the company's website, it is the only free zone developer operating two free trade warehousing zones (FTWZs) and the largest private container train operator with pan-India operations. The company also owns the only private
inland container depot
with six rail loop lines.
The company's resolution professional Pankaj Mahajan declined to comment, citing confidentiality due to the ongoing corporate insolvency resolution process. Emailed queries to Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone,

""A diverse group of bidders are interested in the company due to large assets at very strategic locations,"" said the person cited earlier. ""It has a container yard with an approximate storage capacity of 6,000 containers and seven warehouses with a combined total leasable area of about 1.16 million sq ft."" Arshiya was admitted under CIRP in April last year following an application by its lender Punjab National Bank. It had defaulted on dues of about ₹193 crore.
Sudip Mahapatra, partner at law firm S&R Associates, said companies with real physical assets undergoing CIRP are attractive targets for many reasons.
""Firstly, the physical assets will typically not lose value during the insolvency resolution process. Secondly, the debt can also be brought down to a sustainable level through the IBC process to make the business viable,"" said Mahapatra.
""Companies with real assets therefore tend to see more interest from bidders. Also, given the massive growth in India's consumption story, there is a significant interest in the logistics sector,"" he added.

Highway development gave a boost to economic growth: IIM Bangalore Study,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/highway-development-gave-a-boost-to-economic-growth-iim-bangalore-study/articleshow/117603649.cms,27-01-2025,"Highway development
in the country since 2013 has had a multiplier effect on India's economic growth with each unit of expenditure made on highway construction resulting in a 3.21 unit increase in GDP growth, shows the preliminary report by the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, accessed by ET.
Further, there has been a 9% increase in household income, 6% increase in household expenditure and 10.4% increase in car sales in the country between 2013 and 2022.
Besides, there has been a 2.94% and 1.33% decrease in cost of transportation between the factory and the supplier and between factory and the customer respectively.
The report, done by the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore’s Supply Chain Management Centre (IIMB-SCMC) in partnership with the National
Highways
Authority of India (NHAI), was aimed at assessing the socio-economic impact of national highway development during this period.
“This research study reveals a notable increase in household incomes, relative impact on household expenditure, improved access to agricultural markets, optimized employment accessibility and the availability of job opportunities,” Jitamitra Desai, professor of operations research in the decision sciences (DS) group at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore told ET.

“Besides, there have been notable changes in consumption behaviour, catalyzing growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), enhanced accessibility to schools, higher education institutions, essential healthcare services, and community services, and an attributable development in transportation accessibility,” he added.
According to professor Desai, findings also indicate reduced crime rates, accidents, pollution, noise levels, and congestion in treatment districts.
The results are based on survey data and methodological analyses across over a hundred districts, strategically chosen to encompass diverse socio-economic contexts, including employment, economic vitality, accessibility, and overall quality of life, influenced (or not) by the presence of national highways.
Length of national highways in India has gone up to 1,46,145 km in 2023-24 from 91,287 km in 2013-15, a jump of 60.1% while the expenditure on

This assumes significance in view of India's 100 years of independence in 2047 and the government's goal of 'Viksit Bharat@2047'.
Addressing the inaugural of ISSA-ESIC International Seminar 'Formalization & Social Security Coverage for Workers in the Informal Sector Challenges & Innovation', Mandaviya stated that the infrastructure investment budget was Rs 1.2 lakh crore in 2012 and this budget was Rs 2.4 lakh crore in 2014 under the Narendra Modi-led government.
""In 2024, the budget has been pegged at Rs 11.5 lakh crore. We have to take it to Rs 15 lakh crore. When the government will invest Rs 15 lakh crore on infrastructure for the next 25 years, only then India will become a developed country (by 2047),"" he said.

According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, over 500 million Indians live in urban areas. The economic survey of India 2023-24 further predicted that more than 40 per cent of the population will reside in urban areas by 2030.
The government needs to be prepared to cater to the growing needs of cities. Majority of economic activities are projected to happen in urban regions, with 70 per cent the GDP coming from these areas, according to Auguste Tano Kouame, World Bank’s Country Director for India.
“Globally, economies in the new-age world are driven by a services industry that is people dependent, and therefore a significant portion of the population resides in cities, which are hubs for services-oriented firms,” said Bhavik Bhandari, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Ashwin Seth Group.
“Indian cities are part of this phenomenon and many of them have dramatically transformed in recent years with increased investments in transport, energy, and digital networks empowering cities to support industries, create jobs, and improve living standards. A comprehensive urban renewal program is essential to address aging infrastructure and improve quality of life since many age-old structures can be repurposed to align with modern day living,” added Bhandari.

Union Budget 2025: How Budget may determine India’s economic trajectory on the global stage
In view of the growth, the Indian government had
urban development
as one of its nine priorities of the 2024
budget
. The government had allocated Rs 82,577 crore for urban development in the previous budget. This included key schemes like the lower stamp duty for property purchased by women, establishing weekly street ‘haats’ in select cities, focus on transit related development in 14 large cities and water management. Additionally, the PMAY 2.0 scheme was introduced in the budget.
“The Government’s initiative to build 10 million houses under the
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
(PMAY) is a commendable step, further complemented by measures such as enhanced home loan subsidies and stamp duty reductions for women. While the real estate market continues to show growth, the affordable housing segment has faced a decline, with housing prices in key cities rising by as much as 46 per cent,” Kaushal Agarwal, Co-Founder & Director of The Guardians Real Estate Advisory, told ET.
The pre-budget consultation meeting involving Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman discussed issues like affordable housing, rental housing, slum redevelopment, and infrastructure development. The government is also looking for the creation of a better environment for growth.
Niranjan Hiranandani, Managing director of Hiranandani Group, had said, “In my whole career of 40-plus years, this is the first year where affordable housing growth is negative. It has never happened in my whole career. So I think the focus on the PM Awas scheme for the purposes of incentivizing affordable housing was a major thing.”

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna
The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Urban (PMAY) 2.0 was given a budget of Rs 10 lakh crore alone for urban housing.
“The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana stands out as a critical initiative by the government, addressing this demand-supply gap in housing and making homeownership more accessible, particularly in urban areas,” Shikha Kapur, Partner, Deloitte India said.
The scheme aims to build 1 crore affordable houses in urban areas for people to live in. The growing urban population means that these areas will be the centre of growth in the near future, and basic shelter facilities for all are important.
“By promoting mixed-use projects, green infrastructure, and planned densification, the PMAY program has the potential to completely transform urban housing. Prioritising these components in the next budget could spur the development of lively and inclusive urban areas, meeting housing demands and improving community quality of life,” Dikshu Kukreja, Managing Principal, CP Kukreja Architects, told ET.

“PMAY is not only facilitating affordable housing but is also contributing to the creation of new infrastructure, which aligns with broader urban development goals. Ultimately, PMAY is paving the way for a more sustainable and inclusive urban environment, where housing for all becomes a reality,” Deloitte's Kapur added.
Focus on sustainable development
While the PMAY scheme is one of the major urban development projects of the government, it would want to focus on
sustainable development
, keeping climate change and its consequences in view.
As the world stares at a climate crisis, the Indian government has set certain environmental goals to sustain in the future. Several greenfield projects have been introduced and these have to coincide with urban development planning.
“The rapid growth of urban areas will put massive pressure on natural infrastructure such as soil, water, forest, wetlands etc. To overcome such critical and complex challenges, stronger budgetary support for the development of next-gen urban areas which are sensitive to water and ecology,” said Jaya Dhindaw, urban development professional and researcher specialisnig in sustainable development.
The 2024 budget had allocation for water management in cities. The initiative aimed to bring together the Union Government, state governments and multilateral development banks for promoting water supply, sewage treatment, and solid waste management projects in 100 large cities. These projects will also utilise treated water for irrigation and filling up nearby tanks.
“This budget should allocate greater reform linked incentive provisions to encourage cities to transition towards becoming water sensitive cities. The reforms should include adoption of water sensitive urban planning and development approaches for enhancing the capacity of urban areas to absorb, infiltrate, store, delay, retain, purify, reuse and drain storm water and sewage effectively and should ensure that urban development, economic growth and ecological health are in balance,” added Dhindaw.
Apart from water management, the budget would have to focus on overall sustainability. Urban areas need to be more eco-friendly that not only support growth but also support the future generations.
“Partnerships that drive sustainable infrastructure projects must be explored, along with incentives for the use of eco-friendly construction materials such as steel slag and recycled plastic waste for road development,” Y R Nagaraja, Managing Director of Ramky Infrastructure, said.
Bhandari called for further tax benefits for green projects and waste water management solutions.
“Sustainability should take center stage in the budget. Tax benefits for green-certified projects, subsidies for renewable energy adoption in construction, and incentives for waste and water management solutions are critical. Policies encouraging the development of eco-friendly housing will align the real estate sector with India’s commitment to global environmental goals,” Bhandari said.
Kukreja, on the other hand, called for allocation of large funds to combat air pollution and water management in order to develop resilient and sustainable cities.
“The urgent need for addressing air pollution must take precedence in urban development priorities. Allocating substantial funds to combat this crisis is essential — what’s the point of a Viksit Bharat if urban citizens are inhaling poison every second? Our cities are also struggling under the burden of waste, turning into sprawling garbage dumps. Increased and dedicated allocations for waste management are crucial to restoring the health of urban environments. In order to create resilient and sustainable cities, urban water management is essential,” Kukreja said.
Inclusive urban development
While there is a need for sustainable development, the government's focus should also be on inclusivity and must be extended to tier 2 and tier 3 cities.
“The vast majority (about 92 percent) of India’s urban centers are small towns with a population of less than 100,000. Smaller towns have a high potential for accommodating future urbanization. However, they lack capacities and skills to design, and deliver resilient infrastructure and service,” Dhindaw said.
“We need to focus on educational institutes and vocational training in these centres to build a skilled and relevant workforce- while uplifting the quality of life for the people living there,” she added.
Apart from housing and sustainable development projects, the government will also need to focus on transport and mobility within cities.

“We hope to see increased allocations for infrastructure development, especially for seamless connectivity, urban mobility solutions, and smart city projects. Incentives for real estate developers to invest in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities could decentralise urbanisation and unlock the potential of underutilised regions,” Bhandari said.

It passes through 12 districts, including Wardha, Yavatmal, Hingoli, Nanded, Parbhani, and Sindhudurg. By creating a faster and more convenient route, the project will enhance regional tourism and development.
Connecting pilgrimage and progress
A key feature of the expressway is its ability to link important pilgrimage sites. Stretching from Wardha to Sindhudurg, it will facilitate easier access for devotees and tourists, fostering spiritual tourism and driving economic growth in the region. The expressway will cover three religious sites- Tuljapur near Solapur, Mahalaxmi in Kolhapur and Patra Devi. The connectivity between Wardha and Sindhudurg will also enhance accessibility to various major pilgrimage sites, boosting spiritual and economic development.
Shaktipeeth Expressway Villages along the route
The expressway will traverse villages such as Sangavade, Sangavadewadi, Halasavade, Nerli, Vikaswadi, Kaneriwadi, Kaneri, Kogil Budruk, and Khebwade. This integration of rural areas is expected to spur economic opportunities and development in these regions.
Shaktipeeth Expressway Cost
The cost of the Shakitpeeth Expressway is around Rs 86000 crore
Nagpur-Goa Shaktipeeth Expressway to be India's longest
This expressway will rank among India’s longest highways, surpassing the 701-kilometer Nagpur-Mumbai Expressway. Beyond its physical expanse, it symbolizes a connection between cultural traditions and the economic aspirations of Maharashtra’s populace. The Nagpur-Goa Shaktipeeth Expressway’s achievement in becoming one of the longest in India extends beyond its length. It will act as a bridge between people, their religious traditions, and economic aspirations. Its scope extends beyond reducing travel times. By connecting districts, fostering economic development, and linking Nagpur and Goa, it aims to improve the quality of life for millions. This initiative is poised to be a transformative project for the state and its people.

Overcoming hurdles
The project has advanced despite facing several challenges. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis directed expedited land acquisition efforts, enabling the Rs 86,000-crore initiative to progress. The expressway, modeled after the Samruddhi Expressway, highlights the state’s dedication to improving infrastructure and reducing travel times.

Green investments in India to rise 5x to Rs 31 lakh cr through 2030: Crisil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/green-investments-in-india-to-rise-5x-to-rs-31-lakh-cr-through-2030-crisil/articleshow/117268927.cms,15-01-2025,"New Delhi: India will see a five-fold growth in green investments to Rs 31 lakh crore between 2025 and 2030, rating agency
CRISIL
said on Wednesday. It further said this is a crucial part of an estimated USD 10-trillion investments needed through 2070 to achieve the country's net-zero goals as per the Updated First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.
""Based on the plans announced by the government and corporates, and progress on the ground, we estimate Rs 31 lakh crore of green investments through 2030,""
Crisil Ltd
Managing Director & CEO Amish Mehta said.
""Accelerating grants and incentives, scaling up blended finance initiatives with multilaterals, policy support and flexibility to drive initiatives for carbon market development and industrial decarbonisation are imperatives in the road ahead,"" he added.
Among India's key NDC commitments are a 45 per cent reduction in the carbon intensity of its
gross domestic product
(GDP) by 2030 from 2005 levels, and an increase in the share of cumulative installed power capacity from non-fossil-fuel-based energy resources to 50 per cent.
The rating agency said of the Rs 31 lakh crore investments foreseen, Rs 19 lakh crore is seen going into renewable energy and storage, Rs 4.1 lakh crore into transport and automotive sectors, and Rs 3.3 lakh crore into oil & gas.
Live Events
However, it said for relatively high-risk projects such as green hydrogen, CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation and storage), energy storage and other emerging technologies, government grants and incentives will hold the key in improving project viability.
According to the latest Crisil InfraInvex, which has been measuring the investability or 'investment attractiveness' of select infrastructure sectors, four power-linked sectors -- renewables, conventional generation, transmission, and distribution -- have done well due to improving policy framework and investment opportunities.
Mining and the EV ecosystem saw some loss of investment attractiveness, Crisil InfraInvex added.
The mining sector can benefit from sharper focus on critical minerals, while the EV ecosystem awaits the next round of policy interventions.

Atal Setu
, inaugurated a year ago, recorded an average traffic of fewer than 23,000 vehicles per day, lower than the initiation projections of handling more than 56,000 vehicles daily. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the nearly 22-km-long bridge, which connects Sewri in Mumbai to Chirle in Navi Mumbai, on January 12, 2024, marking the completion of a major infrastructure project in Maharashtra.
Built at a cost of about Rs 17,840 crore, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri-Nhava Sheva Atal Setu is the longest bridge in India and also the longest such structure on sea in the country.
In a release on Monday, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (
MMRDA
) said the Atal Setu (formerly
Mumbai Trans Harbour Link
or MTHL) was ""emerging as a symbol of modern infrastructure, safety, and efficiency"".
The bridge, that crosses over the Thane creek, facilitated the movement of 83,06,009 vehicles over the past year, significantly contributing to smoother and faster transit between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, the state-run agency said.
As per a MMRDA report, on an average 57,525 vehicles were projected to use the bridge daily by 2021 (the structure was inaugurated after much delays) and 88,550 by 2031.
Live Events
With an average daily traffic of 22,689 vehicles since its inauguration, the bridge witnessed its highest single-day count of 61,807 on January 14, 2024, just after it was thrown open for people's use, the release said.
As many as 77,28,149 cars, 99,660 mini buses and LCVs, 1,17,604 buses and two-axle trucks, 1,99,636 three-axle vehicles, 1,60,061 four to six-axle ones and 899 over dimensions vehicles used the Atal Setu in the last one year, the MMRDA pointed out.
""In just one year, it has transformed the commuting experience for over eight million vehicles, contributing significantly to the economic and social development of the region,"" the release quoted Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis as saying.
The Atal Setu's robust traffic management and emergency response systems, comprising the Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS), Fire-Rescue Vehicles (FRVs), maintenance teams, and patrolling units, have ensured seamless operations and swift incident handling, the release said.
""Three specialised teams work 24/7 to monitor traffic, provide medical aid (in case of injuries), and clear disruptions, minimising hazards and maintaining high safety standards,"" it stated.
The six-lane bridge, having about 16.5 km length over the sea and 5.5 km on land, is also meant to provide faster connectivity between the Mumbai International Airport and the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (expected to be operational later this year).
It has reduced the travel time from Mumbai to Pune, Goa and South India, besides improving connectivity between Mumbai Port and Jawaharlal Nehru Port.

Sonamarg tunnel
, located in Ganderbal district. His visit marked the completion of the Z-Morh tunnel, which will ensure all-weather connectivity to the picturesque Sonamarg region.
After landing at Srinagar's international airport, PM Modi traveled by Air Force helicopter to Neelgrad, where he was taken in a cavalcade to the Gagangir area for the official inauguration. The tunnel, which bypasses avalanche-prone sections of the Srinagar-Sonamarg highway, is set to boost the region’s tourism, making Sonamarg a year-round destination.
The event was attended by Union Minister of Surface Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, MoS (PMO) Dr Jitendra Singh, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, and Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah. Following the inauguration, PM Modi addressed a public rally in Sonamarg, where hundreds braved the cold to hear him speak.
The 6.5 km Sonamarg tunnel, constructed at a cost of Rs 2,700 crore by APCO Infratech, was overseen by the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL). Construction of the tunnel began in 2018. It will reduce travel time dramatically, cutting down a journey that once took hours on the winding road to just 15 minutes.
The tunnel is expected to provide a major boost to local employment, trade, and tourism, with positive implications for the Ladakh region, the Amarnath Yatra, and local businesses. Additionally, the
Zojila Tunnel
, currently under construction, will complement the Sonamarg tunnel, making the journey to Ladakh safer and potentially accessible throughout the year.

"Hybrid annuity model for road construction is expensive, says NHAI member",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/hybrid-annuity-model-for-road-construction-is-expensive-says-nhai-member/articleshow/116995074.cms,06-01-2025,"The
hybrid annuity model
(HAM) is costly to the government and the new build-operate-transfer (BOT) model is expected to attract more private players to invest in
road construction in India
, Rajender Kumar, member (finance), the National Highways Authority of India said Monday.
""Unfortunately, the previous version of BOT has not worked. Several factors contributed to the challenges including forecasting or estimation as we had issues pertaining to land acquisition,” he said.
Speaking at a panel session at the National Summit on Indian Infrastructure for
Viksit Bharat 2047
by the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) on Monday. Kumar said one good thing about the road sector is that the corrective action has been taken very quickly by signing of HAM contracts.
""However, if we see HAM it is very costly to the government.We not only give a grant upfront but also return the money arranged by the concessionaires with interest,"" he added.
According to Kumar, after gaining entire experience from the last 10-15 years,
NHAI
has now come out with a new BOT contract which has been crafted with due consultation from all the stakeholders.
Live Events
“We have tried to address all risk-related issues, either by creating a very credible policy or bringing clarity on termination payments, bringing in clauses for buyback, among others. Once this new BOT is tested by the market, we expect that it will perform better than what we have seen in the previous version,"" he added.
Talking about the NHAI budgetary allocation, Kumar said this year (2024-25), NHAI got Rs 2,20,000 crore. ""Nearly Rs 2 lakh crore comes from the government, in the form of capital grant or investment into NHAI. Plus we also execute certain works on behalf of the ministry of road transport and highways and some funds come from that,"" he said.
Kumar said NHAI also gets some funds through the monetization and toll-operate-transfer (T-O-T) model. ""But monetization funds are treated differently as we retain them with ourselves and use them to retire debt. The T-O-T proceeds are treated like toll receivables, and they are remitted to the consolidated fund of India, which will again be brought back into NHAI as toll,"" he said.
The NHAI spent Rs 1,70,000 crore in 2022-23 and Rs 2,00,000 crore in 2023-24, Kumar said, adding 65% of this is invested into land acquisition and the civil construction cost.
As per Kumar, the private sector contribution to the road sector is minimal. ""In an ideal scenario, maybe the public sector and the private sector contribution could be 60:40. But then that's not happening. Maybe with the BOT picking up, we hope it will ultimately move in that direction,” he said.
According to Kumar, India is a developing country, its road network is expanding and it would take some time for us to have a stable network.
“So we are estimating that we will be constructing roads for another 10 to 12 years, and then the network will stabilize at that point of time. Then we will slowly move to asset maintenance,” he added.

Stable policy framework key to attract investments in infrastructure sector: Aviation secy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/stable-policy-framework-key-to-attract-investments-in-infrastructure-sector-aviation-secy/articleshow/116990900.cms,06-01-2025,"Policy stability, improvement in efficiency and respect for contracts are the key essentials for attracting
international investments
into the infrastructure sector in the country, civil aviation secretary Vumlunmang Vualnam said.
“Infrastructure, by design, tends to have a long gestation period and a long investment period. So I think that certainty, that confidence, that the framework would remain stable is important to attract international investors or international developers and various other agencies,” Vualnam said.
“From the government side, what we have tried, is the stability of the framework and respect for contracts by all parties, which comes either through a statutory provision, or through the concession agreements which have been signed, or whichever clauses,” he said while speaking at a panel session at
National Summit
on
Indian Infrastructure for Viksit Bharat 2047
by the
India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited
(IIFCL) on Monday.
Other members of the panel, however, said efficiency in decision making and execution of the projects, introducing scale, speed and simplicity and ability to innovate are other key requisites to make world-class infrastructure in the country by 2047 when India becomes a Viksit Bharat.
“From the multilateral institution side, we find that the decision making is still very slow in India with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka better than India,” Sanjeev Kaushik, principal finance sector specialist at the
Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said.
Live Events
According to Kaushik, the government must identify the top 50 projects across the country as
mega infrastructure projects
and target them to deliver in the next five years through a dedicated team of officers responsible at the state level. “This will help in fast tracking execution which is a big issue,” he said.
Kaushik said India needs to tap on to concessional finance for some under resourced infrastructure sectors, for example, education and health, to catalyze further flow of funds.
Pawan Kant, chief executive officer of Interise InvIT pointed out the need for a
National Transport Policy
with focus on faster clearances to infrastructure projects and provision of a reset clause in the infrastructure contracts considering the changing dynamics of transportation in India.
“Our sector has been mired with very slow clearances especially when you look at divestment. It takes months to get the file cleared out an existing promoter,” Kant said vouching for identifying top 50 mega projects for India
Reiterating that not everything can be the responsibility of the central government, Pankaj Sindwani, chief business officer of Tata Cleantech Capital said multilateral institutions can play a very vital role in allocating the risk capital which bridges that gap between perceived risk and the real risk.
“That's where the role of multilateral institutions is very, very important. I think the decision making there will also need to be improved,” Sindwani said, adding speed in terms of decision making and dispute resolution and predictability and robustness of policy framework will be the key factors for the sector.
Palash Srivastava, chief executive officer, IIFCL Projects said replicability needs to be built in infrastructure projects to avoid reappraising projects by financial institutions.
“Since the sector has grown so well in these last few years, I would like to actually make more reliance on the energy and the excitement of people at large and the ability to innovate and take failures in stride,” he added.

Rs 150 crore are to be released every month until June end of this year, said a press release issued by the Chief Minister's office.
The Chief Minister held a review of the R&B and Panchayati Raj departments at the Secretariat on Friday evening. CM Revanth Reddy made several key comments regarding rural roads. The width of single-lane and double-lane roads has been decided in accordance with the movement of bullock carts, bicycles and motorcycles in the past.
Now, cars, tractors and other four-wheeled vehicles are moving on the roads even in remote villages. Hence, the dimensions of the roads should be redefined to facilitate the increasing vehicular movement in the villages, the Chief Minister said in the meeting.
The Chief Minister emphasized that the roads should be constructed in a way that the vehicles can move freely without any hurdles. Even though Tandas and Gudems have been upgraded as Panchayats, the construction of roads and panchayat school buildings are neglected. CM Revanth Reddy ordered that every panchayat in the state should have a BT road and there should be no panchayat without a BT road.
The Chief Minister also ordered the officials to develop a single road network between the villages and mandals and double roads from the mandals to the district headquarters. Repairs should also be started immediately on potholed roads in rural areas, the CM said, pointing out that different methods were adopted in the construction standards of Panchayat Raj and R&B roads.

Roads under the two departments should be built with the same quality standards, the CM said that the Motorists did not differentiate whether they are travelling on Panchayat Raj roads or R&B roads and the only thing is how they travel on the road. The CM also suggested that a road network should be developed even for the villages in the forest areas.

Faced with criticism over poor quality of certain highways, such as Delhi-Jaipur (NH-48) and Amritsar-Jamnagar Economic corridor on social media, the ministry is set to take steps to improve the quality.
Live Events
Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari has repeatedly expressed frustration over poor quality of construction of some highways.
To enhance accountability and assess the quality of construction and maintenance of National Highways, state-owned National Highways Authority of India (
NHAI
) earlier this month introduced a comprehensive rating system for performance assessment of the concessionaires engaged in such works.
A detailed methodology for rating the concessioners has been formulated by NHAI under which concessioners will be evaluated every six months and ratings will be uploaded on the NHAI website and its social media handles.
In 2025, the NHAI is aiming to set new benchmarks in
quality construction
and management of National Highways and provide a safer, smoother, and seamless travel experience to National Highway users.
Construction of the much delayed
Delhi-Mumbai Expressway
, Delhi-Dehradun Expressway, and Bengaluru-Chennai Expressway is also likely to be completed in 2025.
The ministry is also likely to push a corridor-based highway
infrastructure development
approach focusing on ensuring consistent standards, user convenience and logistics efficiency, as compared to the earlier project-based development approach, focused on addressing stretches of local congestion.
This corridor approach has already led to the identification of a network of 50,000 km of high-speed highway corridors through a scientific transport study based on GSTN and toll data to support India's transformation into a USD 30-plus trillion economy by 2047.
By the end of the ongoing fiscal year, the ministry is aiming to increase the length of operational high speed corridors (HSC) to 4,827 km. Till December 2024, the ministry has been successful in operationalising 4,693 km of HSC in the country.
The ministry is also likely to issue bids in a transparent manner for multi-party interoperable system for barrier-free
toll collection system
based on satellite navigation technology.
Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal told PTI that 2024 has been significant so far as the
shipping industry
is concerned.
""Of Rs 80 trillion investment projected in the maritime sector in the next 25 years in
Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047
, Rs 54 trillion is estimated in enhancing India's ship ownership, ship-building and ship registration ecosystem,"" Sonowal said.
He further said steps required to be taken to boost the Indian shipping industry include granting infrastructure status to ships under DEA's harmonised master list, and bringing vessels within the ambit of the SARFAESI Act, allowing creditors to leverage the Act's mechanisms for efficient recovery of dues.
According to the minister, domestic shipyards such as
Cochin Shipyard Ltd
, L&T Shipyard, Swan Energy (Pipavav Shipyard), Chowgule Shipyard, and Shoft Shipyard are in talks with global players to participate in ship-building and ship-repair clusters.
Sonowal noted that the beginning of construction of the largest all-weather deep-draft mega port of India -- Vadhavan Port -- to become one of the top-10 ports of the world, along with commencement of major infrastructure projects in Kandla Port, Tuticorin Port, and Galathea Bay Transshipment Hub in the coming year would have far-reaching implications for creating a rejuvenated and vibrant Port and maritime ecosystem across the nation.
ICRA
Vice-President and Sector Head Vinay Kumar G said the outlook on the toll roads sector is stable.
""The healthy toll collection growth, lower outflow towards operations and maintenance (O&M) should support the debt coverage metrics for BOT toll road assets,"" he said.
Tata Projects Ltd MD and CEO Vinayak Pai said 2024 has been transformative for the country's infrastructure sector.
""As we step into 2025, the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) sector is poised for further growth, driven by progressive policies, increased investments, and a unified push for sustainable infrastructure,"" Pai added.

Revamped infra monitoring system to be unveiled in January,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/revamped-infra-monitoring-system-to-be-unveiled-in-january/articleshow/116808973.cms,31-12-2024,"New Delhi: The Centre's infrastructure project monitoring system is undergoing a revamp to enhance milestone tracking in the pre-construction stage and provide information on every step of the project, according to sources.
The updated system, set for launch next month, will identify potential slippages so that costs and timelines remain within approved limits, people aware of the development said. It will also capture project start and tender award dates compared with the board approval date recorded previously. Additionally, project completion date will be derived based on the start date.
The Online Computerised Monitoring System (OCMS) of the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI), which facilitates project monitoring by the Prime Minister's Office, cabinet secretariat and government think-tank NITI Aayog, tracks central
infrastructure projects
worth ₹150 crore and above. The
OCMS
portal releases monthly and quarterly reports on the status of central infrastructure projects across sectors and states. These reports include details on completed, added, deleted and ongoing projects. On the financial side, it provides information on original and anticipated costs, enabling tracking of cost overruns or additional expenditures.
As part of the revamp, OCMS will integrate with the
India Investment Grid
(IIG)-Project Monitoring Group (PMG) portal through API (application programming interfaces) to ensure single entry of a particular data point and uniformity across definitions and calculations.
The effort will be closely coordinated with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), the source said.

IIT study finds out smart cities' biggest challenge,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/iit-study-finds-out-smart-cities-biggest-challenge/articleshow/116792516.cms,30-12-2024,"A new study by IIT-Kharagpur has revealed for challenge faced by India's much-touted
Smart City Mission
, ToI reported on December 30. The Integrated Command and Control Centers (ICCCs) in 100
smart cities
across India are suffering from inadequate funding, ToI's report (by Dipak K Dash) said.
These centers manage various city services, including infrastructure, traffic, surveillance, and disaster response. The study, focusing on ICCCs' role in disaster management, found that their financial sustainability is the biggest hurdle.
According to the IIT-Kharagpur report, ""At present, the revenue generated goes to the state exchequer with no basis for sharing with ICCCs which have to install, maintain, operate and periodically upgrade infrastructure. There are huge recurring costs required for the operation and maintenance of such infrastructure. A mechanism for cost sharing is mandatory for supporting the allied functions of the ICCC.”
Researchers recommend sharing revenue generated from ICCC operations like traffic management and surveillance. They also suggest monetizing assets like fiber optic cables and mandatory mobile applications linked to the centers to generate funds. The report emphasizes the need for these apps to connect citizens with local authorities and the Smart City Mission.
The study also noted a heavy reliance on private companies to manage the centers. It recommends building in-house expertise among city staff to reduce dependence on these outside vendors. While praising the role of ICCCs in disaster management in cities like Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatnam, and Agartala, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, the study also highlighted the need to protect ICCC hardware against theft and vandalism.

Jyotiraditya Scindia
on Saturday held a meeting with Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
in New Delhi to discuss
India Post
's path to profitability.
Scindia and his team at the
Department of Posts
presented their capital expenditure demands to the finance minister to make the department a profit centre by 2029, according to a press note.
In the meeting, Minister Scindia presented a new development plan for India Post. He shared that the department is working on rationalising costs and aiming to make maximum processes digital.
He reiterated that his aim is to make the department a profit-making logistics company with a focus on customer satisfaction.
He also talked about how the ongoing Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) exercise will benefit a lot from the investment from the Finance Ministry.
Live Events
He shared that the BPR exercise will also focus on launching more attractive business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) services.
In the meeting, Scindia shared that with investment from the Finance Ministry for our capital expenditure, we will focus on infrastructure development and renovation of post offices as well as staff housing quarters across the nation.
He also stated that the department will work towards automation of processes to make them efficient and future-ready.
Minister Scindia, in 2007, standardised the look and feel of post offices and helped Dak Sewaks get office equipment. In 6 months of him taking charge of this department in 2024, he had asked his India Post team to get exposure to international best practices and come up with innovative strategies for the department.
Scindia shared that he believes in India Post's potential to increase market share for most of its products, increase revenue and compete in the industry in the next 5-7 years. He shared that the focus will be on expanding the market share in mail and parcel verticals.
India Post is the postal network of the Department of Posts (DoP) in India, which is responsible for the country's communication and social economic developments.
Among the significant initiatives this year, the department has introduced PMA (Parcel Monitoring Application), real-time delivery information sharing. From May 2019 to October 2024, the delivery of accountable mail has shown remarkable growth from 4.33 lakh articles to 5.35 crore articles, as per the official data.
India Post has also implemented e-Clearance of Letter Boxes, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Click N Book Service, Nodal Delivery Centres and Transshipment Centres and has signed an MoU with the e-commerce giant Amazon to strengthen logistics operations.

Budget 2025-26: Rural roads scheme could get 10% topup; FY26 outlay hike likely,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/budget-2025-26-rural-roads-scheme-could-get-10-topup-fy26-outlay-hike-likely/articleshow/116662058.cms,26-12-2024,"NEW DELHI: The Centre is likely to raise the outlay for its key roads scheme by nearly 10% in the budget for the next fiscal year to deepen its rural push, recognising the high multiplier effect of such productive spending on the economy.
The
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
(PMGSY) scheme received a budgetary allocation of Rs 16,100 crore for this fiscal.
Connectivity in Remote Areas
This was higher from the revised estimate of Rs 14,800 crore in FY24. “The government intends to maintain its rural focus. The PMGSY or the Prime Minister
Rural Roads
in particular, will see a hike in outlay, considering its multiplier effect,” a person aware of the matter told ET.
The
Modi administration
remains focussed on building 62,500 km rural roads in five years by connecting 25,000 rural habitations under the fourth and the latest phase of PMGSY by revamping the ongoing programme, the person said. The target is on top of rural road projects already sanctioned or planned in the earlier phases. The government had announced the fourth phase of the rural roads scheme in the July budget The scheme is aimed at substantially improving road connectivity in remote areas, stimulating economic growth and alleviating poverty.
Live Events
Subsequently, the government, in September, approved a Rs 70,125 crore package for the latest phase spanning five years.
Earlier this month, rural development minister
Shivraj Singh Chouhan
said under the fourth phase, sanctions had already been granted to construct 6,614 km of rural roads, of which 3,380 km would be built in West Bengal alone.
According to Chauhan, since the scheme’s launch in late 2000, rural roads stretching over 769,284 km have been built against the sanctioned length of 834,457 km.
A new phase is typically rolled out by widening the scheme’s scope and revamping the implementation method.
PROJECT COMPLETION
As of April 2, more than 90% of roads identified under the scheme have been built in 16 states and Union territories, with Goa touching 100%. In 13 others, 80-90% of construction has been completed.
However, completion ranged between 60% and 72% in Andaman & Nicobar, Ladakh and Puducherry.
On the multiplier effect, a 2018
World Bank
study on the impact of PMGSY revealed that farm produce transported to markets for sale using roads built under the scheme had increased 8% than before.
The rate of primary employment in the non-farm sector had improved about 13% due to the improved road network and the share of people with primary employment outside their habitation had inched up 8%.
Even the share of babies delivered at homes declined by 30% in connected habitations, leading to improved child mortality in rural areas.

Infrastructure Finance
Company Ltd (
IIFCL
), the finance ministry said in a statement on Monday.
The signatories to the Financing Environmentally Sustainable Growth in Infrastructure Project were Juhi Mukherjee, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, for the Government of India, and Country Director Mio Oka for ADB.
""ADB financing will help IIFCL provide long-term capital for infrastructure projects focusing on connectivity and energy transition as well as under-resourced sectors like urban projects, education, and health care,"" said Oka.
To meet its net-zero commitments, the country needs immense
private capital investment
that will require innovative financing platforms and risk-mitigation instruments to address inherent sector risks and market asymmetries, it said.
As a strategic development finance institution, IIFCL is well-suited to meet these needs, it said.

ADB has worked closely with IIFCL over the years to develop its operational and risk management capacities.
As IIFCL has developed and evolved, its operations are increasingly geared toward leveraging private sector resources that necessitate the expansion of its product offerings for potential institutional investors, it said.
The project will build the institutional capacity of IIFCL to integrate green and best practices into the infrastructure projects, it said.
A sustainability unit and an environmental sustainability framework and scoring method to assess the sustainability rating of the projects will also be established, it added.

“Common policy will help all stakeholders.

Commenting on the need for a good quality as well as cost effective construction, Gadkari said, the quality of national highways in the country is not up to the mark and we need technological innovations to develop best quality infrastructure which is also economically viable.
“The pre-cast technology is one option going forward,” he said.
“Besides, we need to look at alternatives to stainless steel as its cost is going up and one option could be glass fibre steel that can make these projects viable,” Gadkari said.

According to Gadkari, India should also look at
Make in India
construction machinery as such imports from China are getting difficult.
Citing the example of
Zojila tunnel
, Gadkari said the adoption of futuristic technology has helped save Rs 5000 crore on the project. “The estimated cost for the project was Rs 12,000 crore but has now saved Rs 5000 crore,” he said.
Gadkari urged industry to look at alternative materials and better technology for construction of tunnels and bridges to reduce cost but without compromising on quality of construction.

“Initially highways were constructed manually. Subsequently highway construction evolved to mechanized construction. Now with technological development and considering the availability of intelligent road construction machines, it is the right time to adopt Automated & Intelligent Machine aided Construction (AIMC),” the ministry said in a notification.
According to the notification, some of the benefits of AIMC include using digitized construction data to achieve high adherence to design specification, enhance efficiency and reduce wastage.
“Time bound construction without compromising quality of construction (smooth levelled and adequately and uniformly compacted surface), improved rideability, enhanced performance and longevity, increased productivity, real time documentation, better transparency and minimum human interventions are the other benefits,” it added.

Don't see any slowdown in public infra funding: Bentley Systems,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/dont-see-any-slowdown-in-public-infra-funding-bentley-systems/articleshow/116323847.cms,15-12-2024,"Mumbai:
Bentley Systems
, the Nasdaq-listed infrastructure
engineering software company
, does not see any slowdown in India's infrastructure spending which will help its India business grow faster than the average of the company, said a senior company official.
Bentley Systems develops, sells, and supports software for the design, construction, and operation of infrastructure. Their software is used in the building, plant, civil, and geospatial markets.
""Even though a lot of infrastructure work is done by engineering firms and private companies, it is tied to public funding, and there's no slowdown in public funding for infrastructure. Infrastructure investments are going to be needed, to stimulate the economy,"" Nicholas Cumins, CEO, of Bentley Systems, told ET.
Maintaining strong fiscal support for infrastructure over the next five years, the Indian government in the budget allocated a spend of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for capital expenditure for FY2024-25, which is 3.4% of GDP.
Bentley Systems has been in operation in India for over 24 years. Its user base includes firms across engineering and construction companies and several public sector agencies involved in the design, construction, and operations of infrastructure.
Live Events
Approximately 70% of the software work being done by the company in India is engineering resources supporting projects outside of India, with the remaining 30% supporting local Indian projects.
""The next five years we see a lot of growth continuing in water; the water infrastructure and energy, which is especially around the transmission distribution as that network and the grid is modernised, we see a lot of growth potential there. And of course, renewables is a strong potential driver,"" said Cumins, adding that it sees its Indian user base expanding.
Bentley Systems India has a workforce of over 800 colleagues, which represents more than 15% of its global workforce. But there is a shortage of engineers and the industry demand is far outpacing what the company is able to deliver. ""In some countries, you will see backlogs that got least one year out and you will see engineering firms who refuse work,"" said Cumins.
This October, Bentley Systems, tied up with Google to integrate Google's high-quality geospatial content with Bentley's infrastructure engineering software and digital twin platform to improve the way infrastructure is designed, built, and operated.
""Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a big role to play when it comes to an existing infrastructure asset and we need to understand the operating foundations of that asset,"" said Cumins adding that there are two ways of doing it-sending people to inspect the facility or use digital means by flying a drone that captures pictures and videos of infrastructure asset.
""And then we use AI to process all of that data and understand, ""Ah! This is vegetation or this is a potential crack or spalling on a bridge, and then we can trigger remediation work. We see governments as becoming more aware of this,"" added Cumins.

""However, there are certain bottlenecks limiting this scope. Hence, radical measures are required to induce a higher allocation of private investments towards infrastructure development to balance fiscal prudence to the government's budget and bring inclusive and long-term sustainable economic growth in the country,"" he said.
Knight Frank's report said that the central and state governments' heavy reliance on infrastructure investments could strain fiscal deficit targets.
""Private participation in infrastructure development in India has decreased significantly, from USD 160 billion (46.4 per cent of total investments) between 2009-13 to USD 39.2 billion (7.2 per cent) between 2019-23,"" the consultant pointed out.
This shift has led to a larger share of government-led investments, potentially widening the fiscal deficit, it added.
""Maintaining a controlled fiscal deficit is crucial for long-term economic stability and effective debt management. The central government aims to reduce its gross fiscal deficit to below 4.5 per cent by 2025,"" the report said.
Increasing
private sector participation
in infrastructure development would help balance fiscal deficit targets, the consultant felt.
""By increasing the private participation in infrastructure development, the government can redirect the expenditure towards other key segments of economic growth such as public healthcare, strengthening human capital, debt payments, etc., which will support long-term growth of the economy,"" Knight Frank said.
On a sector-wise analysis, the report found out that renewable energy, data centres, roads and highways, warehousing and logistics have significant potential to attract private investments.
Supported by a rapid urbanisation and shifting demographics, the consultant said that sectors such as urban mass transit, airports, power distribution etc. hold massive investment opportunities.

NHAI to rate concessionaires on the quality of construction and maintenance of national highways,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/nhai-to-rate-concessionaires-on-the-quality-of-construction-and-maintenance-of-national-highways/articleshow/116048310.cms,06-12-2024,"The
National Highways
Authority of India has introduced a comprehensive rating system for assessing performance of the concessionaires engaged in the development and maintenance of the national highways across the country.
The idea is to enhance accountability and set new benchmarks in quality construction and management of national highways and provide a safer, smoother, and seamless travel experience to national highway users,
NHAI
said on Friday.
By establishing a transparent framework for concessionaire evaluation, NHAI aims to set new benchmarks in quality construction and management of National Highways and provide a safer, smoother, and seamless travel experience to National Highway users.
As per the assessed ‘Concessionaire Rating Value’, concessionaires will be divided under different categories. Contractors scoring less than 70 out of 100 rating will be declared ‘non-performers’, thus becoming ineligible to secure new national highway projects till improvement in its rating.
The assessment of the concessionaires will be done at two levels, first at individual project level and second at concessionaire level. The rating value at project level as well as combined concessionaire rating value would be reviewed every six months with every cycle of network survey vehicles (NSV) survey. Data related to defects rectification compliance on
NHAI One App
will also be used for calculating rating value.

According to NHAI, a detailed methodology for rating the concessioners has been formulated under which concessioners will be evaluated every six months and ratings will be uploaded on NHAI website and its social media handles.
“The assessment methodology will be based on Pavement Condition Index (PCI) as well as Defect rectification compliance on NHAI One App, where over 95 defects can be notified and monitored digitally, shall also form a part of rating assessment,” it said.
“80% weightage would be given to PCI and 20% weightage would be given to compliance on NHAI One App,” it added.
PCI, which is a scientific metric ranging from 0 to 100, reflects pavement conditions from ‘excellent’ to ‘failed’ as per IRC 82:2023 guidelines.
PCI will be calculated based on six functional parameters that include roughness, potholes, cracking, ravelling, rut depth and patchwork. The data for PCI value will be calculated using the laser crack measurement systems through Network Survey Vehicles (NSV) and will be surveyed and processed through centrally deployed agencies by NHAI under supervision of a dedicated team.

Public investments in infra surpass pre-Covid level: Finmin,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/public-investments-in-infra-surpass-pre-covid-level-finmin/articleshow/115944356.cms,03-12-2024,"Public investments in infrastructure, as a percentage of the country’s gross domestic product (
GDP
), have exceeded the pre-pandemic level, the Rajya Sabha was informed on Tuesday.
Infrastructure investments by the Union and state governments and Central Public Sector Enterprises touched 5.87% of GDP in 2023-24, higher than 5.03% in the previous year and 5.76% in the pre-pandemic year of 2019-20, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in a written reply.
In absolute terms, the investments surged to Rs 17.35 lakh crore in 2023-24, against Rs 13.57 lakh crore in the previous fiscal and Rs 11.57 lakh crore in 2019-20, he said.
The Central government, in particular, has raised its
capital investments
sharply in recent years, using the high-multiplier effect of such spending to nurse the Covid-hit economy back to health fast. The Centre’s annual capex hike has been in the range of 17% to 39% annually since FY22.
For the current fiscal, the Centre alone has budgeted its capital spending outlay at a record Rs 11.11 lakh crore. This includes Rs 1.5 lakh crore in long-term interest-free loans to states to bolster their capex.

“Over the years, the government has significantly increased investment in the infrastructure sector, which is expected to crowd in private investment,” Chaudhary said.
Several measures have been introduced to attract private sector participation, including supporting the
public-private partnerships
with viability gap funding and reforms for innovative financing tools like InvITs, REITs and IDFs, the minister said.
Similarly, to ensure long-term infrastructure financing, institutions like the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development have also been set up, Chaudhary added.

rapid transit projects
for development under the India-UK investment bridge, according to a report in the Times of India. As per the report, India is willing to tailor the design for greater participation from global investors.
A discussion on potential projects was held also where representatives from the City of London Corporation, officials from Niti Aayog and other ministries and companies from the UK and India, including foreign companies operating in India participated.
Quoting govt sources, ToI claimed that the participation will be open to global bidding, not nomination. This comes as foreign companies have largely exited India's road sector, leaving smaller Indian developers to fill the gap.
Chris Hayward, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, outlined the plan: “We are receiving presentations from Indian partner companies and also from the UK companies. We have got major engineering firms like Mott Macdonald and Arup, which have global companies with huge global experience in infra projects. The plan is, between now and March next year, we are going to identify three projects with Indian govt which are likely to be in the sectors of roads, rapid transit and renewables.”
The partnership will initially focus on identifying three projects by March 2024, with UK firms offering project management expertise. The long-term goal is to attract capital investment from the UK to support India's sustainable transport strategy. Hayward expressed hopes for a lasting partnership: “Once those are agreed, we will be bringing to the table the expertise that the project management firms can supply. In due course, we expect that to expand to capital investment and capital coming out of London and out of the UK to support PM Modi's sustainable transport strategy. This is a two-year agreement initially, but we hope that it would blossom into a long-term partnership between London and the Indian govt because the growth in India is so spectacular and so fast that India needs friend and partners to support in delivering infrastructure ambitions.”
Live Events
Hayward emphasized the need for mutual benefit and acknowledged past challenges for UK firms in India, stating: “One of the challenges of this bridge is that British and other firms have had their fingers burnt. The whole market in India has developed or changed since those days. But, of course, the first thing is confidence building in the British companies that they are not going to get their fingers burnt.” The role of a potential bilateral investment treaty remains under discussion, with Hayward highlighting the need for regulatory certainty and ease of participation for UK businesses. He noted: “There are negotiations still in play. For this to succeed, the Indian govt has to make it as easy as possible for UK businesses to participate. If barriers are put up that are unacceptable, then it will not work. Regulatory certainty is important for everything, the world over.”

""Our Non-Performing Asset (NPA) levels are on 0.22% so we are highly insulated. In the global investment scene, we are not investing any projects outside India. We are only investing in projects within India in the debt side,"" Jaishankar said in response to a question on whether IIFCL had exposure to the Adani group and is concerned about the
US Department of Justice
(DOJ) acting against them.
IIFCL is aiming at achieving zero NPA levels. According to a company presentation, there have been no fresh NPAs during fiscal 2023-24 and in the first half of the current fiscal.

There are several benefits of using the PM GatiShakti system, including significant cuts in time and cost for planning these infrastructure projects.
The maximum number of projects recommended by the group are related to roads (108), railways (85), urban development (12), and four from the oil and gas ministry.
The inter-ministerial NPG meets every fortnight and appraises infra projects to ensure multi-modality, synchronisation of efforts, and comprehensive development in and around the project location.

Over 1,600 layers of data, including those related to land, ports, forests, and highways, are available on the portal.
Usage of the portal by different ministries, including social sector departments and states, is increasing, and it is helping in the proper planning of projects.

Electronic toll collection
in India totalled ₹6,114.92 crore in October, the highest in a month since the collation of data from 2021 and 7.6% higher than the monthly average of ₹5,681.46 crore over the previous six months, according to government data, signalling robust economic activity during the festive month.
Total electronic toll collection in the country in the first six months of this financial year stood at ₹34,088.77 crore, up 9.8% from ₹31,026.64 crore a year ago.
A senior government official said the toll collection in October reflected a surge in both business activity and personal road travel, as Dussehra and Diwali fell in the same month. Electronic toll collection was up 8.8% month-on-month from ₹5,620.48 crore collected in September and 10.4% higher than ₹5,539.20 crore collected a year ago. Increased passenger vehicle movement for festive celebrations, especially toward month-end, added to the toll collection in October, said Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, global head of consulting, Crisil Market Intelligence and Analytics.
""Heightened goods transportation to retail outlets at the start of the month to stock for the season and continuous highway traffic for e-commerce deliveries throughout October significantly fuelled toll collection last month,"" Padmanabhan said.

The India Economic Outlook, 2024 by Deloitte projected a rebound in rural consumption spending due to moderating inflation.
""Better rainfall (over June to September, precipitation in the country as a whole was 109% of its long-period average in 2020, and it has been the third highest since 1994) and all-time high production and stock of kharif crops (such as rice and paddy sown during the monsoon season from June to August) point to robust agricultural output this year, thereby further pushing rural demand,"" it said, adding that this was likely to factor into spending during festive months and beyond.

Govt plans to incentivise planned urbanisation of peri-urban areas,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/govt-plans-to-incentivise-planned-urbanisation-of-peri-urban-areas/articleshow/114920220.cms,04-11-2024,"New Delhi: Encouraging planned development of peri-urban areas while discouraging haphazard growth and illegal constructions is likely to be the focus area to tap into Sixteenth Finance Commission grants. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is finalising its recommendation to the commission to incentivise planned urbanisation of peri-urban areas, people aware of the matter said.
The ministry has formed sub-groups to address specific areas like political intervention, administrative reforms and financial resources, they said.
The five-member Sixteenth Finance Commission, chaired by former Niti Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya, was constituted on December 31, 2023, and is expected to finalise its recommendations by October 2025. Its recommendations will be valid for five years from 2026-27 to 2031-32.
The commission is expected to recommend ways to augment the revenues of urban local bodies.
While the Fifteenth Finance Commission incentivised urban reforms with a sharp focus on rapid urbanisation, the ministry now wants to incentivise planned development of peri-urban areas, people cited above said.

""While the Fifteenth Finance Commission's focus was cities, we want this time to focus on peri-urban areas so that states start planning for urbanisation and not just allow these areas to grow organically and haphazardly,"" a senior official, who did not wish to be identified, told ET, adding that the ministry is looking at involving various planning bodies in this process.
""The problem is that these planning bodies at the state level are very top heavy with, say, the chief minister as the head. How many times can these bodies meet in a year and discuss micro issues? These processes and structures need to be broken down. This can be done only if these are incentivised,"" the official said.
The Fifteenth Finance Commission categorised urban local bodies into two groups based on population - those with a population of less than one million received basic grants while those with a population of more than one million received 100% performance-linked grants. It recommended a total of Rs 1,21,055 crore for urban local bodies from 2021-2026.
The finance commission decides what proportion of the Centre's net tax revenue goes to states (which is known as vertical devolution) and how this share is distributed among various states (which is known as horizontal devolution).

He said that economic viability is important for the projects. ""In the road construction, we are using many technologies. We have to develop economy and protect ecology and environment,"" he added.
Gadkari mentioned that the priority is to standardize policies and transform the ropeway industry by promoting the manufacturing of ropeway components under the ""
Make in India
"" initiative.
In his address, Gadkari said that the foremost priority of the sector in India should be to make ropeways economically viable by bringing down the overall project cost to make this affordable.
Gadkari said focus should be on developing indigenous and cost-efficient solutions without compromising safety.

"Freight corridors contribute Rs 16,000 crore to India’s GDP",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/freight-corridors-contribute-rs-16000-crore-to-indias-gdp/articleshow/114552023.cms,24-10-2024,"India’s existing
Dedicated Freight Corridors
(DFCs) will contribute Rs 16,000 crore to the country’s gross domestic product, a study by Australia-based University of New South Wales has found. Sharing findings of this study, a Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (
DFCCIL
) statement said reduction in freight cost and travel time due to operationalisation of the
Western DFC
(WDFC) has helped reduce commodity prices by up to 0.5%.
In addition to this, the study also found that DFC contributed to 2.94% of the revenue growth realised by Indian Railways between by FY 2022–23 and FY 2018–19. Over 10% of freight running on the Indian Railways is now handled by DFC.
This study concluded that introduction of the DFC contributed to overall national economic benefits, with greatest benefits being realized in western regions closest to the DFC due to significant reductions in freight costs.
“Regions further away also experienced economic advantages from the decreased transportation costs,” the DFCCIL statement said while adding that findings indicated a ""Social-Equalizing Effect,"" with states that have a lower per-capita GDP experiencing significant benefits.
The 2,843-kilometre (km) long DFC project passes through 56 districts in seven states and is 96.4% complete as of October-2024. Of this, the 1337 km long
Eastern DFC
(EDFC) runs from Ludhiana to Sonnagar and the 1506 km long WDFC connects Dadri with Mumbai.

According to DFCCIL, the EDFC is 100% complete and operational with feeder routes to different coal mines and thermal power plants. WDFC is 93.2% complete with feeder routes serving various cement plants and the large ports of Mundra, Kandla, Pipavav, and Hazira in Gujarat.
An average 325 trains are currently running per day on the freight corridors which is 60% more than last year.

Sarma had said, “We decided it will come between Numaligarh and Gohpur where both rails and vehicles will move. The two banks of Brahmaputra North and south will come closer.”
At a review meeting with Sarma and other senior officials of NHIDCL, NHAI and State PWD in the national capital, Union Minister Gadkari called for completion of the 28 ongoing projects that are running on schedule and for expediting completion of 11 numbers of delayed projects under NHIDCL in Assam.
Following the plea of Chief Minister Sarma, Gadkari instructed the officials to expedite the completion of balance work of four-laning of 14-km stretch of Jorhat to Jhanji and from Jhanji to Demow stretching 11 km of
NH 37
under SARDP-NE. Gadkari also asked the officials to put up road signages at proper places to prevent road mishaps on this vital portion of NH 37.
The Chief Minister requested Gadkari for deputing a Minister of State to inspect the ongoing work of four-laning of NH 37 from Jorhat to Dibrugarh.
The remaining work of four-laning of Demow to end of Moran bypass of NH 37, widening of four-lane with paved shoulder of Kawaram Taro Village-Dilai Section of NH 29 under NH(O), NE, including Manja bypass, four-laning of NH 37 from end of Moran bypass to Bogibeel, development and upgradation of four-laning from Jamugurihat end to Biswanath Chariali Bypass of NH 52, construction of Indunglo to Jatinga junction and from Jatinga to Harangajao of NH 54 also came up for detailed review.
On Chief Minister's plea, Union Minister Gadkari asked the officials to complete the process for awarding the contract for the 121-km
Guwahati Ring Road
at an estimated cost of Rs.5,729 crore by November end, to submit DPR for the elevated corridor of over 85-km length over Kaziranga National Park at a cost of Rs.5,500 crore and re-tendering of
Majuli bridge
over the Brahmaputra.
Chief Minister Dr.Sarma also urged Union Minister Gadkari to hasten the process for Majuli bridge connecting Kamalabari and Nimatighat over the Brahmaputra, four-laning of Baihata Chariali to Tezpur highway stretch and construction of Mangaldoi bypass on NH 15.
The Union Minister also reviewed the status of ongoing four numbers of projects that are on schedule and four projects with one-year delay under State PWD and MoRTH.
Sarma urged the Union Minister to see to it that existing roads are kept in good shape by NHIDCL and NHAI during construction of NHs to prevent accidents. Gadkari asked the senior officials, including GM, NHIDCL to blacklist contractors who did not adhere to the provisions of keeping the existing roads in good condition by way of imposing default liability.
Sarma further requested Gadkari to formulate a different work schedule for civil works in Assam in particular and the Northeast Region as a whole keeping in view the monsoon season from April to October. Taking into account the Chief Minister's suggestion, Gadkari directed the senior functionaries of the Central Road agencies to work on it.
Later taking to X, Chief Minister Sarma wrote, ""Today in New Delhi, I had the privilege of attending a review meeting led by Hon’ble Union Minister Shri @nitin_gadkari ji, focused on the development of 1001 kms of highway projects in Assam.
Our collective priority remains the timely completion of 57 critical
National Highway projects
across various implementing agencies.""

Rise of new cities: Meet the new Gurgaons of India that are growing quietly but steadily,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/rise-of-new-cities-meet-the-new-gurgaons-of-india-that-are-growing-quietly-but-steadily/articleshow/114378934.cms,20-10-2024,"The Union government recently shared six concept notes with state governments to address unemployment and underemployment in rural areas and bottlenecks holding back job generation in non-metro cities. The feedback from states will be discussed at the fourth National Conference of Chief Secretaries, scheduled to be held in November under the chairmanship of the prime minister. What that gathering may also take up is India’s new phenomenon: the rise of
satellite cities
, which is gathering pace quietly but steadily.
Sri City
in Andhra Pradesh,
Hosur
in Tamil Nadu,
Dahej
and
Dholera
in Gujarat.
Manesar
in Haryana,
Greater Noida
in Uttar Pradesh, and
Shendra-Bidkin
and
Navi Mumbai
in Maharashtra. These new Gurgaons are promising to be new industrial and population hubs, taking away the pressure from overcongested New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Ahmedabad. Urban planning and development experts believe these new satellite cities that tap into the overflow from abutting megacities could be the real answer to India’s urban woes.
THE PRIVATE TOWN
Sri City, whose body is in Andhra Pradesh but soul in Chennai, brings a unique twist to the concept. This 40 sq km township is located only 55 km from Chennai, and is privately owned. It’s a distinct corporate-driven model that sets it apart from typical suburban areas. Of the 220 companies, predominantly multinationals, that have made Sri City their base, giants like Kellogg’s churn out cereal, Alstom builds metro coaches, Colgate-Palmolive produces toothbrushes, and PepsiCo bottles soft drinks.
Launched in 2008 in Tirupati district during the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) boom, this satellite city also boasts Asia’s largest chocolate factory. Confectionery titan Mondelez, known for its iconic Cadbury chocolate, set up its Rs 1,250 crore plant here in 2016, cementing Sri City’s status as a powerhouse for global brands. With four seaports and two airports—Tirupati and Chennai — within a 100 km radius, this satellite hub has become a magnet for global investors.
Live Events
“We are expanding residential options to create a ‘walk-to-work’ environment,” says Ravindra Sannareddy, founder and managing director of Sri City Pvt Ltd. The workforce is expected to grow from 62,000 to nearly 100,000 soon, with another 200,000 indirect jobs on the horizon, he says. Sri City is also home to Krea University that aspires to be an academic centre of international repute. Its governing council includes former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel laureate Esther Duflo.
A QUIET BOOM
India’s G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant says Shendra-Bidkin in Maharashtra and Dholera in Gujarat—both designed as sustainable industrial hubs with residential spaces—hold the same potential as Sri City. Shendra-Bidkin, situated near the industrial zones of Aurangabad, is being developed as a hub for export-oriented businesses, while Dholera is envisioned as a cutting-edge industrial smart city, with Tata Electronics recently establishing a semiconductor fab.
Dholera is about 100 km from Ahmedabad. Dahej, with its flourishing chemical industries, has capitalised on its coastal location to attract more businesses. Manesar benefits from seamless connectivity to Delhi, driving industrial growth and real estate development, says Kant, who was the CEO of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (now the National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation) in 2009-14.
“The Noida-Greater Noida region continues to thrive as a technology and manufacturing hub, benefiting from its strategic proximity to Delhi and extensive infrastructure, which attracts businesses and enhances residential opportunities,” he says. Kant’s list also includes Navi Mumbai with its upcoming international airport. He notes that these satellite cities do more than just alleviate the pressure on overcrowded metros. They open up new economic opportunities and are instrumental in fostering balanced regional growth.
URBAN LEGENDS
The introduction of GST in 2017 streamlined interstate trade, making a satellite city’s location across state lines irrelevant for businesses. This has fuelled growth in places like Hosur. It is in Tamil Nadu but has seen a surge in development due to its proximity to Karnataka’s capital Bengaluru.
Although cities occupy just 3% of India’s geography, they generate a substantial 60% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Between 1970 and 2018, India’s urban population surged fourfold—from 109 million to 460 million—as noted in the 2018 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects published by the UN. The significance of cities—and the inevitable expansion of suburban areas and satellite cities—is underscored by projections that India will add another 416 million people to its urban areas by 2050, at which point half of the population will reside in cities. According to the 2011 Census, India had 7,935 towns and cities, a notable rise from 5,161 in 2001. While a city is typically larger than a town, the 2011 census, the most recent such count in India , used the term “Urban Area” to encompass towns and cities.
According to OP Agarwal, former urban transport specialist at the World Bank, satellite cities can be right next to a major city or 100 miles away. “What defines a satellite city is its strong connection to the main city, thanks to a robust transport network. It essentially rides on the metro’s foundational infrastructure. Take Gurgaon. It taps into Delhi’s universities and airport,” he says.
Agarwal says the emphasis of policymakers should shift to satellite cities and city clusters whether in linear or circular formations. “The bulk of India’s ambitious goal to grow its GDP from $3 trillion to $30 trillion by 2047 will have to come from urban areas,” he says. “This growth will largely spring from tier-2 and-3 cities, many of which are satellite cities.” He adds, “To attract investments, especially from manufacturing firms, satellite cities need to ensure essentials are in place— power, water, road connectivity, labour and more.”
Rumki Majumdar, an economist in Deloitte India, emphasises on smarter town planning and transport. “India will need smart urban planning and investment in connectivity so that satellite cities can become key engines for industrial expansion, innovation and job creation,” she says, stressing that decongesting major urban centres is essential for a more balanced distribution of economic opportunities. “By fostering regional development, satellite cities can offer people lower cost of living, improved infrastructure and a better quality of life. They will help attract companies and talent,” she adds.
GOING UP
When it comes to satellite cities, urban planners and policymakers are under growing pressure to develop vertical cities featuring 20-storey to 30-storey apartment buildings. “Metro rail and other public transit systems depend on population density, which is driven by verticalisation,” says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert and founder, The Infravision Foundation. He says for vertical growth to be truly sustainable, it must be matched with essential civic amenities like water and sewerage systems. “The success of any satellite city depends on enhanced transport connectivity,” he says.
For instance, Meerut, situated 80 km east of Delhi, has emerged as a thriving satellite city, with real estate prices soaring due to the development of an expressway and the upcoming regional rapid rail project. The completion of the 508 km Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train corridor, likely by 2028, will elevate the status of cities like Bharuch in Gujarat, which will have stops for the slower version of the bullet train that will travel from Mumbai to Ahmedabad in less than three hours.
As India’s major metros grow increasingly congested and almost unlivable, the chaotic expansion of suburban areas and satellite cities only intensifies the challenges of rapid urbanisation. “We still lack a cohesive policy to address areas adjacent to larger cities,” says M Ramachandran, former secretary in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, adding that the National Capital Region concept, an outcome of a legislative process, is an exception. “Cities like Bengaluru have absorbed nearby villages into their limits, but the downside is that they also inherit rural issues, such as outdated sewerage and water supply systems,” he says.
ROAD AHEAD
India’s policymakers have also overlooked the challenges posed by the rapid spread of “census towns”. These settlements resemble towns and have a population of over 5,000, with more than 75% of the male workforce engaged in non-agricultural work. Many of these are springing up between metros and their satellite cities. The number of census towns surged from 1,362 in 2001 to 3,894 in 2011, creating new headaches for urban planners.
Often governed by panchayats, these areas —such as Chikhli near Surat and Nandigram in the south of Kolkata— are rarely integrated into broader urban strategies.
“When a census town lies close to a city, there is a strong case for including it in the city’s overall planning,” says Ramachandran. He warns that the rapid construction of cities without careful planning or vision risks making these new urban areas unlivable. “In some respects, old metros still offer a better quality of life than emerging satellite hubs. For instance, Delhi has far more greenery than Gurgaon,” he says.
Despite hosting top companies like Accenture, American Express and Google, property prices in Gurgaon are 60% lower than that of Delhi. As of September 30, the average residential price in Gurgaon is Rs 9,500 per sq ft, compared with Delhi’s Rs 24,200, according to Anarock, a real estate consultancy firm. In Sohna, a little away from Gurgaon, properties are about 25% cheaper than in Gurgaon. Based on current real estate trends, Greater Noida, Navi Mumbai, Gurgaon, Sohna, and New Town in Kolkata are among India’s most prominent satellite cities, experiencing substantial growth over the past two decades and showing strong promise, says Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock group.
“These cities are not just seeing high real-estate activity in terms of new supply and housing sales but have also seen high growth in average residential prices,” he adds. Among these, only New Town boasts higher average residential prices than its main city; a home here costs 14% more than in Kolkata, according to Puri’s analysis.
Urban planners and policymakers must adhere to a simple yardstick: the new satellite cities have to be more innovative, vibrant and aesthetically pleasing than the cities of the past.
Hope the National Conference of Chief Secretaries will take note.

Supercharging one key market is crucial to India’s $5 trillion goals,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/infrastructure-investments-infrastructure-bonds-supercharging-a-market-is-key-to-indias-5-lakh-crore-goals/articleshow/114343476.cms,18-10-2024,"India, already the world’s fastest-growing major economy, is pushing for even more dramatic expansion to become a developed nation, a goal that hinges on expanding access to capital.
Nothing illustrates that challenge better than the 47 trillion rupee ($559 billion)
corporate bond market
. It’s one of the world’s smallest as a percentage of gross domestic product, at just 16%, even after record growth. Bankers in Mumbai say doubling that ratio would better help finance ambitious goals, like becoming a $5 trillion economy in the next three years.
One of the major impediments is a longstanding rule from authorities that makes it hard for long-term investors like insurers and pension funds to go big on infrastructure. The regulation bars them from investing in notes rated below AA, which in India are deemed risky because they’re hard to offload in a smaller market during times of stress.
Spending on roads, ports and bridges, as well as on all kinds of capital expenditure, is set to reach about 110 trillion rupees ($1.3 trillion) between 2023 and 2027, an increase of 70% from the previous five years, according to the National Stock Exchange of India. The company notes market will likely cover just one-sixth of that amount, it said. That’s due in part to those restrictions, given many infrastructure borrowings carry lower or no ratings.
“The corporate bond market is not deep enough to support the country’s infrastructure finance requirement,” said R Shankar Raman, director and chief financial officer at Larsen & Toubro Ltd., India’s top engineering company. For these reasons, the firm has tended to rely mainly on its own cash and bank loans for funding, and has only tapped the bond market once in the past four years.

Government financing of course plays a major role in the infrastructure projects dotting Indian cities. But as the economy gets even bigger, the need for both the local credit market and overseas lenders to offer alternative funding sources will become more acute.
The subways, airports, sanitation and electricity grids underpinning urbanization in the world’s most populous nation take years to build. Such time horizons attract investors like insurers who need cash flows that match their longer-term payouts. But in India the regulatory hurdles have disrupted this dynamic.
Insurers are also subject to a cap on their exposure to infrastructure assets. For instance, they cannot invest more than 20% of the cost of the project.
“The rules clearly deserve a relook,” said Somasekhar Vemuri, senior director regulatory, affairs and operations at Crisil Ratings Ltd., a local unit of S&P Global Ratings. “There can be guidelines based on the investor’s risk capital to avoid concentration risk rather than linking the exposure limit to the issuer’s capital base.”
A spokesperson for the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, the industry watchdog, said that the authority will continue to review investment measures and look at any innovative debt instruments that would enable infrastructure funding.
A representative at the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

There has been some progress. That follows steps spanning recent years up to just the past few days— measures that stand to strengthen the bond market and wean companies off bank borrowings. Those include:
The securities regulator on Wednesday introduced a measure to boost liquidity in the secondary market for company bonds
In April, the Securities and Exchange Board of India shifted to allow borrowers to privately place bonds with face values as low as 10,000 rupees, in an effort to boost retail investor participation. The previous threshold was 100,000 rupees
In 2022, SEBI took a step to enhance liquidity in the bond market, by encouraging bigger outstanding issuance sizes of the kind that are more easily traded. It made it compulsory for companies to have no more than nine conventional bonds maturing within a given year, which effectively encouraged them to tap existing securities, increasing their overall size
Earlier, in 2016, borrowers were required to issue privately placed notes using an electronic book platform to improve price discovery and reduce costs
Companies have already raised almost 8.6 trillion rupees selling bonds in 2024, set for a second record year. Banks and shadow financiers are leading the expansion amid a double-digit spurt in loan demand.
At the same time, companies helping to fuel India’s expansion also have other debt financing options. Some prefer local loans. The amount of such lending to industries and services stands at about 28% of GDP.
What would be one of the largest local-currency deals in India this year highlights the reliance on loans for key infrastructure. State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp. is in talks with lenders to raise about 320 billion rupees for building a refinery.
A unit of Indian Oil Corp. is also targeting a 280 billion rupee facility for a similar project.
Loans are often more practical to finance projects than bonds as the money can be drawn in phases, unlike bonds where the funds would sit idle until needed, according to Vetsa Ramakrishna Gupta, director finance at BPCL.
Yet, expanding the bond market remains crucial, as it allows lenders to spread out credit risks. Also, the yields are more sensitive to shifts in policy rates, meaning any central bank rate cut would filter down more quickly.
There are signs of greenshoots as some new lenders that finance infrastructure tap the bond market steadily, said Sujata Guhathakurta, president and head of debt capital markets at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“If the investment rules are relaxed a bit, then investor appetite will improve resulting in the bond market to deepen and grow further,” she said.

Most Indian execs say IT infra 'best-in-class' but only half of them trust risk preparedness: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/most-indian-execs-say-it-infra-best-in-class-but-only-half-of-them-trust-risk-preparedness-report/articleshow/114291762.cms,16-10-2024,"A majority of
Indian executives
believe they have 'best-in-class'
IT infrastructure
, but only half of them trust their systems' preparedness to tackle future risks and challenges, a report said on Wednesday. The findings of the 2024 Kyndryl Readiness Report is based on insights from AI-powered
digital business
platform Kyndryl Bridge as well as a survey conducted across 3,200 senior decision-makers across 25 industries in 18 global markets, covering sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, energy, and finance.
""Among global respondents, India leads in average readiness across risks at 35 per cent. In India, 88 per cent of business leaders are confident that their IT infrastructure is the best in class and 44 per cent among them say their IT infrastructure is ready to manage future risks,"" the report said.
The report further said that 94 per cent of Indian leaders prioritise
technology modernisation
, but 44 per cent of mission-critical IT infrastructure is nearing or has reached end-of-life, raising vulnerabilities and complicating modernization efforts.
Besides, regulatory compliance remains a pressing issue, with most Indian executives believing that policy changes are occurring too rapidly.
Martin Schroeter, Chairman and CEO of Kyndryl, emphasized the importance of aligning technology with organisational culture to navigate these challenges effectively.

""Readiness is an ongoing challenge,"" he said, advocating for a holistic approach that empowers employees and integrates new technologies into business processes.
The report also revealed that India is at the forefront of AI (artificial intelligence) adoption, with 85 per cent of business leaders investing in AI technologies.
However, it said, the AI return on investment is limited by skills, compliance, and compatibility.
A substantial 27 per cent skill gap among Indian leaders in AI and a 10 per cent gap in data science and analytics are hindering the full potential utilisation of these technologies, the report said.

"Union Cabinet approves Rs 2,642-cr Varanasi-DDU multi-tracking project",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/union-cabinet-approves-rs-2642-cr-varanasi-ddu-multi-tracking-project/articleshow/114284944.cms,17-10-2024,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Varanasi-Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) multi-tracking project with an estimated cost of Rs 2,642 crore. The proposed project includes a new rail-cum-road bridge across the Ganga river and the addition of third and fourth railway lines between Varanasi and
DDU Junction
route, among other infrastructural upgrades.
""The proposed multi-tracking project will ease operations and reduce congestion, providing the much-required infrastructural development on the busiest sections across
Indian Railways
. The project traverses through Varanasi and Chandauli districts in
Uttar Pradesh
,"" a government statement said.
It added, ""Varanasi Railway Station, a crucial hub in Indian Railways, connects key zones and serves as a gateway for pilgrims, tourists and the local population.""
According to the statement, the Varanasi-DDU Junction route, vital for both passenger and freight traffic, faces heavy congestion due to its role in transporting goods like coal, cement, and food grains, as well as serving growing tourism and industrial demands.
""To address this issue, infrastructure upgrades are needed, including a new rail-cum-road bridge over the Ganga River and the addition of 3rd and 4th railway lines. These enhancements aim to improve capacity, efficiency and support the region's socio-economic growth,"" the statement said.

infrastructure projects
of different ministries, including roads and railways, worth Rs 15.39 lakh crore have been recommended for approval under the
PM GatiShakti
initiative so far, a top government official said on Saturday. These projects have been recommended by the
Network Planning Group
(NPG) constituted under the PM
GatiShakti
initiative launched on October 13, 2021.
""So far, 208 projects have been assessed under the initiative worth Rs 15.39 lakh crore,"" Secretary,
Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade
(DPIIT), Amardeep Singh Bhatia told reporters.
There are several benefits of using the system, including significant cuts in time and cost for planning these infrastructure projects, he added.
The maximum number of projects recommended by the group are related to roads (101), railways (73), urban development (12), and four from the oil and gas ministry.
The inter-ministerial NPG meets every fortnight and appraises infra projects to ensure multi-modality, synchronisation of efforts, and comprehensive development in and around the project location.
Live Events
The initiative was launched to develop an integrated infrastructure to reduce
logistics costs
. All logistics and connectivity infrastructure projects, entailing investments of over Rs 500 crore are routed through the NPG.
The NPG's approval is required before the clearance of the project by the
Public Investment Board
(PIB) or Department of Expenditure under the finance ministry.
The NMP (National Master Plan) has over 1,600 layers of geospatial data, showing all physical and social infrastructure of an area and land records in one place. It has been designed for faster planning and better design so that the impact of an investment is maximised.
The NPG has representations from various connectivity infrastructure ministries/ departments, involving their heads of network planning division for unified planning and integration of the proposals.
All these departments approach the NPG first for approval before making a
DPR
(Detailed Project Report) at the planning stage. After the NPG's clearance, the project follows the normal procedure of approval by the finance ministry and the Cabinet.
Over 1,600 layers of data, including those related to land, ports, forests, and highways, are available on the portal.
Usage of the portal by different ministries, including social sector departments and states, is increasing, and it is helping in the proper planning of projects.

"Cabinet okays Rs 4,406 cr plan to develop 2,280 km border roads in Punjab, Rajasthan villages",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/cabinet-okays-rs-4406-cr-plan-to-develop-2280-km-border-roads-in-punjab-rajasthan-villages/articleshow/114094010.cms,10-10-2024,"The
Union Cabinet
on Wednesday approved a ₹4,406 crore plan to develop 2,280 km roads in the border areas to connect the villages of
Punjab
and
Rajasthan
. I&B minister
Ashwani Vaishnaw
said these roads are part of the project to connect the border villages with main highways, which were coming up. This would help in connecting these border villages to markets and aid in trade.
The government has already launched programmes to upgrade border villages along the
Line of Actual Control
with China by providing telecom connectivity, roads, infrastructure, etc. In this regard, the government also launched the vibrant village programme last year.
The number of drones seized by the
Border Security Force
has gone up in the first seven months of this year as compared to previous year, said officials. The security forces have seized a large number of drones in Punjab and Rajasthan for smuggling of narcotics, arms and ammunition. Punjab has 23 districts and shares borders with Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. Besides Punjab, the drones are also sighted in Rajasthan's Sriganganagar, Bikaner and Jaisalmer (North).
BSF
also seized arms, ammunition, tiffin bombs and AK-47 pistols being ferried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

"Soon, you can travel from Bangalore airport to Cantt Station in 40 minutes, says Minister Vaishnaw",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/soon-you-can-travel-from-bangalore-airport-to-cantt-station-in-40-minutes-says-minister-vaishnaw/articleshow/113984324.cms,06-10-2024,"People would soon be able to travel from the international airport premises to the Bangalore
Cantt station
in about 40 minutes, MeitY, I&B and Railway Minister
Ashwini Vaishnaw
announced at the ET Startup Awards event, Saturday evening, promising citizens a faster alternative to the road commute.
Vaishnaw himself took the train from the airport to Cantt station where he reviewed the progress of ongoing projects and the planned ones. The journey, he said, took 35 minutes for him and when commissioned in a few months’ time, may take five extra minutes.
The shortest route to the airport from the Cantt
railway station
is 32 kms, but the traffic jams make the travel time unpredictable. MoS (railways) and Tumakuru Lok Sabha member V Somanna would be leading the project of taking the railway station right into the sprawling airport. Last year he inspected the airport line project and most of the work planned had been done, the Union Minister said.
At the Cantt station, he reviewed the progress of the redevelopment work going on at Cantt as well as Yeshwantpur railway stations. The redevelopment at Cantt, the minister said, would result in creation of 18,000 square metres of new land near tracks.
The two stations in Bengaluru are among 1137 stations currently being modernized in India in the world’s largest such redevelopment challenge. Such projects used to take decades, the union minister said, and added that this year 1050 stations would be ready and inaugurated.

CIRCULAR RAILWAY:
The railway board would finalise the detailed project report (DPR) for circular rail for Bengaluru by December. The railways conceptualized the circular railway for Bengaluru last year with seven spokes connecting the city. The lines would connect Bengaluru with surrounding towns and cities like Tumakuru and Mysuru and integrate them closely with Bengauru.
Most people living in those cities and working in Bengaluru can commute daily and get back home faster and, added in a light hearted comment, 'enjoy their dosa.'
The railway ministry, Vaishnaw said, had a capital expenditure of $29 billion last year and constructed 5300 km of new tracks, which is more than the entire rail network of Switzerland.

Union Cabinet
approved the second phase of
Chennai metro
on Thursday. The 119-km network will be built at a cost of Rs 63,246 crore, ending a deadlock over the project that lasted several months, reported TOI.
The entire process of approval of a high investment project came at “superfast train speed” in just one day, sources told TOI. The project was cleared within 24 hours, a rare occurrence considering the size and the number of ministries involved.
The project will have 128 stations and is expected to be completed by 2027. When fully operational,
Chennai
will have a total metro network of 173 km.
PM Modi in a post on X said, “I congratulate the people of Chennai and
Tamil Nadu
on the cabinet’s approval of the Chennai Metro Rail Project Phase-II. This will help in easing traffic, improving sustainability and economic growth.”

Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai aso thanked the PM for the cabinet nod for the project, mentioning that “PM has always had a special interest in ensuring TN receives its rightful share, which was denied during the 10 years of UPA govt, despite DMK holding key portfolios”.
— annamalai_k (@annamalai_k)
The
infrastructure project
will be funded by both the Central and the Tamil Nadu governments. Loans from multilateral funding agencies will also be sanctioned.
The second phase will have three corridors. Madhavaram to SIPCOT, Light House to Poonamallee Bypass, and Madhavaram to Sholinganallur. These corridors will connect north to south and east to west of Chennai, passing through major areas.
While 64 per cent of the corridors will be elevated, the 36 per cent will be underground. The design speed of the network will be 80 kmph, and the scheduled speed will be 32 kmph.
Union Ministry announced the decision and said once the approved phase becomes operational, the metro network will create an additional capacity for 13 lakh passengers per day. The minister added that this phase will integrate with other modes like suburban rail, and inter and intra-city bus terminus at 21 locations. It will also integrate with the Phase-I network at seven locations.

smart cities
will be developed as dedicated
industrial hubs
, each specific to a certain sector, officials said.
While the one in Agra is proposed as a hub for
electric vehicles

These cities will span across 10 states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala and Telangana and six major industrial corridors. They will function more like industrial cities, where residential and commercial setups would co-exist, have plug and play infrastructure with potable drinking water, 24 hours electricity and would be based on the 'walk-to-work' concept.
In Maharashtra, while Bidkin is coming up as an auto hub, Dighi is being developed as a project that would lead to
port-led industrialisation
and industry-led urbanisation while promoting ecotourism.
""Dighi and Krishnapatnam will be important for port-led industrialisation and industry-led urbanisation,"" said Rajat Kumar Saini, managing director, National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation, adding that all projects have been mapped with

Hospitality is also identified as another sector in Gaya while hospitals are showing interest in Agra.
These 12 cities have an investment potential of ₹1.5 lakh crore and employment potential of 1 million direct jobs and up to 3 million indirect jobs.
Japan, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan have shown interest in having dedicated industrial space in these cities. Officials said Switzerland has shown interest promoted by India-European Free Trade Association (EFTA), under which New Delhi has received an investment commitment of $100 billion over next 15 years.

smart city development
in
Uttar Pradesh
is almost sold out and talks are on for the next phase, commerce and industry minister
Piyush Goyal
said Saturday.
Last month, the Union Cabinet approved setting up 12
industrial smart cities
including in Agra and Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, with an overall investment of Rs 28,602 crore, employment potential of 1 million direct jobs and up to 3 million indirect jobs and investment potential of Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
At the UP International Trade Show, Goyal also said that India’s
intellectual property rights
(IPR) regime has improved so much so that in 2014, only 6,000 patents were issued in 2014 but in 2024, one lakh patents were issued.
“We are the 39th rank innovation economy in 133 countries. People who are interested in R&D and innovation, have seen how India’s IPR regime has improved,” he said.
India’s position rose one notch to 39th among 133 global economies in the
Global Innovation Index
2024 released by the
World Intellectual Property Organization
.
Live Events
Noting that India’s identity in the world is now as a quality provider of goods and services, he said: “We should buy products from each other to try to reduce goods made in other countries and instead use products made in India as that would support
MSMEs
and promote One District One Product scheme.”
This, he said, will promote modern technologies like semiconductor, electronics manufacturing, done manufacturing, high quality electric mobility, construction equipment and machinery.
Jan Vishwas 2.0
The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is working on about 100 rules and laws of various departments of government to bring Jan Vishwas 2.0 bill to achieve a greater
ease of doing business
environment in the country as part of the first 100-day thrust of the present government.
The Jan Vishwas Act introduces civil penalties and administrative actions for minor technical and procedural lapses, reducing the fear of criminal penalties and enhancing the ease of doing business and living in the country.
“The decriminalisation effort ensures that penalties are proportionate to the severity of offences while maintaining stringent punishments for serious violations,” DPIIT said, adding that it promotes investor confidence and facilitates smoother business operations.
The Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023 decriminalised minor offences across 42 Central Acts and eliminated 183 criminal provisions across 19 Ministries/Departments.
The Joint Parliamentary Committee, which reviewed the Jan Vishwas Bill, has recommended extending the exercise to further Acts, ensuring the continuous modernization of India's regulatory framework.

Light Rail Transit to connect Noida International Airport with Film City,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/light-rail-transit-to-connect-noida-international-airport-with-film-city/articleshow/113728015.cms,27-09-2024,"Noida
International Airport will be linked with
Film City
off
Yamuna Expressway
with a
light rail
transit that will be integrated with the
Rapid Rail
Transit System (RRTS) route, reported TOI.
The decision was taken at a board meeting of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (
YEIDA
) on Thursday. The
NCR Transport Corporation
made a presentation on the 72km rapid rail route it is planning between the airport and Ghaziabad. The proposal was sent to the Centre for approval, said officials to TOI.
According to an earlier proposal, the 14km route was supposed to be connected by pod taxis. Conceived in 2021, the first tender for 12 stations off the expressway was issued in July last year, with an estimated project cost of Rs 641.5 crore. However, no company came forward despite multiple extensions to submit the bids as there are questions on the project's feasibility.
YEIDA was asked to conduct a comparative study between pod taxis and light rail.

When the Uttar Pradesh government approved the 72km
RRTS corridor
between Ghaziabad and the airport, NCRTC submitted a project report to include either pod taxi or light rail in it.
""The plan now is for three services on the same tracks — metro, RRTS and light rail — with only loops and sections differentiating them.
Metro trains
will run at an interval of 3.5 minutes, rapid rail after every 7 minutes and light rail in a gap of 8 minutes. The UP govt has already approved this plan. It has now been sent to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for clearance,"" Arun Vir Singh told TOI.
There have been no changes in the original 72 km track plan either. ""The RRTS corridor was originally planned in two phases —Ghaziabad to Ecotech VI and Ecotech VI to Jewar. Now, it will be constructed as a single, unified project,"" Singh said.

Each of the three lines will sevre a different purpose. For instance, planning to go to the airport would preferably take the rapid rail because of its speed. Metro, on the other hand, will also ply on the same tracks but will stop at every station, requiring much longer to cover the distance.
Light rail will primarily cater to sectors along the Yamuna Expressway between Film City and airport.
The RRTS project is to be completed by 2031. While the Centre and state governments together will contribute 40 per cent of the funds, the rest will be raised by development authorities in Greater Noida, Yamuna Expressway and Ghaziabad.
NCRTC needs to secure 60 per cent funds initially. If it succeeds, no additional contribution will be required from local authorities.
The board meeting also decided upon a a 10km corridor that will connect the Aqua Line station at Sector 51 with the RRTS corridor at Knowledge Park V.
Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco), meanwhile, has assured YEIDA of a loan worth more than Rs 30,000 crore for connectivity projects, in addition to Rs 3,300 crore for land acquisition.

""The four-priority links are just the beginning of the decade-long plan of the ILR project implementation.

is considered the
Silicon Valley
of India, but Commerce and Industry Minister
Piyush Goyal
wants to create a brand new one.
The minister proposed the creation of a new township dedicated to
startups
during an event in New Delhi on Monday.
“We should aspire to go beyond. We should aspire to have our own Silicon Valley… I know Bengaluru is the Silicon Valley of India, but it's time we started thinking about tying up with
NICDC
and creating a whole new township dedicated to
entrepreneurs
, startups, innovators, and disruptors,” Goyal said.
The National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (NICDC) is responsible for implementing the National Industrial Corridor program to develop new industrial cities. The proposed new township would aim to create a concentrated area, providing support to startups and entrepreneurs who may not have existing connections.
Goyal suggested that the new Silicon Valley could be built on a 500-acre area. “Can we create a society, or a whole 200 or 100 or 500-acre area… and see if we can create such an ecosystem where incubators exist... or where someone from a very distant place with an idea but no connections can land… like people once used to go to Mumbai,” the minister said.

According to the government, India has established itself as one of the largest and most vibrant startup ecosystems globally, with over 1.4 lakh DPIIT-recognized startups as of August 2024. ""However, this tremendous growth has also led to the fragmentation of resources and stakeholders,” an official statement said.
The government has launched a portal,
BHASKAR
, to facilitate better coordination among incubators, policymakers, and other stakeholders.

for such projects.
This will apply to all road and bridge construction under
EPC mode

“Considering the current practices in highway projects and greater emphasis on meeting strength and serviceability requirements in respect of components of a highway project over respective design periods, modifications have been made to the model EPC agreement and RFP for consultancy services for authority’s engineer for supervision of EPC projects,” the ministry said in a notification on Thursday.
Under the amended model EPC agreement, the ministry notified that the engineer will witness all the quality control tests carried out by the contractor as against 50% of the quality of the number of tests prescribed earlier for supervision.
As per the amended request for proposal document for consultancy services for such projects, the ministry mandated engineers to now witness all the quality control tests carried out by the contractor against 60% of the number of tests prescribed earlier for quality control for supervision.

Revamp of Gati Shakti Cargo Terminal Policy in works to woo private players,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/revamp-of-gati-shakti-cargo-terminal-policy-in-works-to-woo-private-players/articleshow/113136535.cms,07-09-2024,"The
Indian Railways
is revamping the Gati Shakti Cargo Terminal (
GCT
) policy to increase private sector participation in setting up freight-oriented infrastructure, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Guidelines will soon be issued to lower costs for private players in the development of new GCTs, they said.
The national transporter is already on course to achieving its target of setting up 100 GCTs and the proposed changes are likely to help in this regard, the people said.
The railways is now looking to double the number of terminals.
Under the proposed changes, some capital expenditure which was earlier borne by the private player can now be incurred by the railways. Further, the railways will not insist on upgraded traffic management infrastructure if the need for it does not arise at terminals where much load is not expected.
Live Events
""Sidings for GCT need not be of mainline standards but should be on the basis of the traffic they are likely to handle,"" RK Jain, former managing director at the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation Ltd, told ET.
""These measures will ensure excess expenditure is avoided and GCTs are made more attractive to investors. Cost saving for a long GCT of around 10-12 kilometres could be to the tune of 10-20% with significant gains due to lowered signalling expenditure.""
Traction substation, a crucial part of
railway infrastructure
that converts electricity from the power grid to run locomotives, will not be planned on the railway siding (private investment) account. No electronic interlocking and track circuiting will be insisted on either.
""Such associated costs will be paid for by the railways, if needed. Fresh changes are being considered to rationalise the capital cost of setting up a GCT,"" said a senior official, who did not wish to be identified.
The GCT policy was launched in 2021 to encourage private sector participation in developing terminals and integrating modern technology for freight management. These terminals are used for handling
bulk cargo
by companies that have interlinkages with the Indian Railways.
The GCT is operated for non-passenger commercial uses such as freight and helping monetise vacant railways land.

Kenya airport: Adani sharpens India's challenge to China's global clout,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/kenya-airport-adani-sharpens-indias-challenge-to-chinas-global-clout/articleshow/113099651.cms,05-09-2024,"Two events unfolding parallelly show how
China
and
India
are vying to gain clout over smaller countries. While China President
Xi Jinping
at a summit in Beijing today has pledged to step up support across debt-laden Africa with funding of nearly $51 billion over three years, backing for more
infrastructure
projects, and the creation of at least one million jobs, workers at an
airport
in Kenya are protesting against India's
Adani Group
.
Adani Enterprises
has set up a company in Kenya to expand and operate Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). The company, Airports Infrastructure, is looking to take over the management of JKIA. The move drew protests from the country's transport workers over potential job losses.
Adani Enterprises has proposed an investment of $750 million for a new terminal and taxiway system by 2029 to the Kenyan authorities, with an additional $92 million for improvements by 2035. If the deal is struck, it will be Adani's first airport outside of India. It currently operates a little over half a dozen airports in the country. Kenya's government has defended the deal as a necessary measure to refurbish JKIA -- one of Africa's busiest hubs -- which is often hit by power outages and leaking roofs. The government said last month that the deal would be ""subjected to technical, financial and legal reviews alongside requisite due processes"".
Adani's entry into Africa is seen as part of its challenge to China which has funded gargantuan infrastructure projects in the continent. Adani's other global infrastructure moves have rivalled China and given India important strategic and economic footholds in other countries.
Adani's strategic global play
Though many Indian infrastructure companies are operating in other smaller countries -- homegrown player GMR operates the Mactan Cebu International Airport in the Philippines and has also bagged deals to operate airports in Greece and Indonesia -- Adani's global infrastructure play, especially in ports, in recent years has competed with Chinese investments. It's the first time Adani is stepping into the aviation sector abroad.

Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd., the world’s largest logistics operator by market value, is either already operating a port or gearing up for it in four overseas locations, as it tries to challenge China’s dominance of the Indian Ocean trade infrastructure. It plans to take over more seaports around the globe, especially in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia, to transform India into a major trading hub. “We are working on making India the center point of the overall supply chain from east to west,” Karan Adani, Managing Director of the company, has told Bloomberg. “We will take positions wherever we have to for achieving this.”
Adani's expansion into smaller countries also ties into India's push to organise the Global South as a bloc of countries. Last year, the African Union formally took its seat as a new member of the G20 at the invitation of summit host Prime Minister Modi.
The Adani Group seeks to extend its footprint in Africa through strategic partnerships that align with local developmental priorities. It is exploring strategic partnership with Tanzania. Adani Ports has secured a 30-year concession agreement through its subsidiary, Adani International Ports Holdings Pte Ltd. (AIPH), to operate and manage a container terminal at the Dar es Salaam Port in Tanzania.
Taking on China
Gautam Adani
, the Chairman of Adani Group, spoke two years ago about the opportunity he saw in the decline of China's project to spread a global footprint. “I anticipate that China, which was seen as the foremost champion of globalization, will feel increasingly isolated. Increasing nationalism, supply chain risk mitigation, and technology restrictions will have an impact,” Adani said, referring to China's scuppering Belt and Road Initiative that envisaged connecting China with dozens of countries through roads, railways, shipping lanes, ports and other infrastructure and energy projects, and provide China strategic footholds all over the world.
Last year, the US invested more than half a billion dollars in a port terminal in Sri Lanka’s capital being developed by Adani. The financing by the American government's International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was seen as the US backing Indian interests in Sri Lanka to curtail China’s influence in South Asia.
Securing a foothold in Colombo’s new port was seen as particularly important for India, with China constructing the adjacent Colombo Port City, a Dubai-like financial hub, and operating the Colombo International Container Terminals Ltd.
Adani also operates the Haifa Port in northern Israel along with a local company after it completed its purchase for $1.03 billion in January this year. Haifa is one of the main seaports in Israel, where about 99% of all goods move in and out of the country by sea. This too was seen as a move to curtail China's influence. China's Shanghai International Port Group already operates a port at Haifa.
China got a port in Haifa in 2021 to strengthen its
BRI
project. Adani buying another port close by will not only boost India's trade ambitions but actually prove to be a counter to the BRI as the proposed India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) is being seen by many as a challenge to China's BRI.
Haifa is a major trade hub on the Mediterranean that gives access to European markets. It will boost trade lanes with the company's Indian ports and could better connect Europe and the Middle East in the longer term, as well as give Indian goods a direct route to Europe.
Adani also plans to build ports in Vietnam and Indonesia, and looks for more opportunities in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, East Africa, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Vietnam and Cambodia as these are regions where trade is coming to India. “The idea is to make India a maritime hub,” Karan, the elder son of Gautam Adani, said. “We are targeting countries that are high on manufacturing or high on population, which will lead to high consumption. We are focusing on export volumes in these countries.”
While Adani is the largest ports
business
in India, it is still a small player overseas. It’ll need to scale up manifold before challenging China’s wide sphere of influence, which is built on investments in more than 90 ports outside its borders, 13 of which have majority Chinese ownership, according to the US Council on Foreign Relations. “Given that Beijing is so far out front, it’s hard for Adani or anyone else to hold a candle to China’s infrastructure investments anytime in the foreseeable future,” Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, has told Bloomberg. “But Adani and his companies are playing a long game. They’re looking to slowly but consistently build out new investments in South Asia and beyond.”

Transforming India's industrial landscape through smart cities,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/transforming-indias-industrial-landscape-through-smart-cities/articleshow/113098934.cms,05-09-2024,"India is on the cusp of a transformative leap in its
industrial development
, with the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (
NICDP
) playing a critical role. Aligned with the vision of a ""Viksit Bharat,"" this ambitious initiative aims to establish a grand necklace of industrial
smart cities
along the backbone of the Golden Quadrilateral. This strategic move is not just a game-changer for India's industrial landscape but also a significant step towards positioning the country as a
global hub
for manufacturing.
The NICDP is set to create 12 industrial smart cities, covering an area approach for world-class greenfield industrial developments. These cities are designed to incorporate the latest
urban planning
concepts such as 'plug-n-play' and 'walk-to-work' frameworks, ensuring seamless integration of industrial and residential zones. This initiative is expected to generate direct employment for nearly 1 million individuals and indirect employment for up to 3 million more. The total investment potential of these projects is estimated at ?1.5 lakh crore, with a project cost of ?28,602 crore.
India's Smart City initiative can draw parallels with similar successful projects across the globe. For instance, Songdo International Business District in South Korea, a purpose-built smart city, is often cited as the benchmark for modern urban planning. Songdo, like India’s industrial smart cities, integrates advanced technology, green spaces, and efficient public transport, aiming to provide a high quality of life while promoting
economic growth
. Similarly, Singapore's
Smart Nation
initiative focuses on harnessing
technology
to improve the lives of its citizens and create new business opportunities. The emphasis on sustainability, connectivity, and innovation in Singapore aligns closely with the goals of India's NICDP, which aims to create an industrial ecosystem supported by robust, sustainable infrastructure.
Historically, India’s industrial landscape has evolved through various phases, with each period marked by significant policy initiatives aimed at fostering growth. The journey began with the establishment of industrial hubs like Jamshedpur and Durgapur during the early years of independence. However, the real momentum was achieved with the launch of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), which laid the foundation for large-scale industrialization in modern India. The DMIC, with its emphasis on creating world-class infrastructure, set the stage for the NICDP, making the latter a natural progression in India's quest for industrial supremacy. The NICDP builds on the lessons learned from DMIC, enhancing the focus on smart urban planning and leveraging technology to create a more integrated and efficient industrial ecosystem.
One of the key strengths of the NICDP is its focus on strategic location and multimodal connectivity. The cities are situated in proximity to major highways, railways, airports, and ports, ensuring easy access to both domestic and international markets. This will not only enhance logistics and transportation but also attract global investors, thereby cementing India's role in global value chains.
Live Events
The integration of last-mile connectivity and reduced ecological impact further underscores the initiative's commitment to
sustainable development
. By synchronizing with other major infrastructure projects, these industrial smart cities will minimize clearance bottlenecks and expedite land acquisition, making it easier for businesses to set up and operate efficiently.
The NICDP is not just about industrial growth; it is also about balanced regional development. By distributing these industrial hubs across 10 states and six corridors, the initiative aims to spur economic growth in underdeveloped regions, thereby reducing regional disparities. This decentralized approach ensures that the benefits of industrialization reach all corners of the country, fostering inclusive growth.
Looking ahead, the NICDP is poised to be at the forefront of integrating emerging technologies into the industrial landscape. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and renewable energy solutions, these smart cities could serve as innovation hubs that drive the next wave of industrial revolution in India.
AI
can optimize manufacturing processes, reduce waste, and improve supply chain efficiency, while IoT can enable real-time monitoring and management of industrial operations. Furthermore, the emphasis on renewable energy within these cities aligns with India’s commitment to sustainability, potentially making these corridors global leaders in green industrial practices.
The establishment of these smart cities is not just an investment in infrastructure but an investment in the future of India—a future where the country stands tall as a global manufacturing powerhouse. As these cities begin to take shape, they will serve as beacons of progress, showcasing the potential of smart urban planning and sustainable development. With the right execution and continued commitment, India's dream of becoming a global industrial leader is well within reach.

Emphasising the critical role of performance audits in ensuring project efficiency, Gadkari said, “performance audit is more important than financial audit”.
Gadkari said there is a need for a holistic evaluation of projects from the initial detailed project report (DPR) stage to implementation. “This approach would help achieve perfection in execution, optimal use of technology, and quality assurance while minimising capital investment,” he argued.
Reiterating that the quality of DPRs is very low in India, Gadkari said DPR consultants are not adhering to proper procedure in the construction of highways, roads and tunnels across the country.

,
Nitin Gadkari
on Tuesday criticized the Detailed Project Report (DPR) makers for not adhering to proper procedures in the
construction
of highways, roads, and
tunnels
across the country.
The Union Minister was speaking at 2nd edition of TUNNELING INDIA: Emerging Trends and Opportunities organised by
FICCI
.
Addressing issues related to road accidents and tunnel failures,
Gadkari
pointedly remarked, ""I should not use these words, but if there is any culprit in this, then it is the one who made the DPR. I apologize; I am using the word 'culprit'. The companies that make DPRs are owned by retired government officials. They work on Google from their homes without any detailed investigation.""
Gadkari further elaborated on the process followed by the government, stating, ""Our government has such a system that after getting the DPR, they only do the work of issuing the tender. Because the ministers are not the ones to understand technical terms, technical and financial qualifications are also wisely included by the officials.""
He expressed concern over the involvement of certain companies in manipulating the tender process, saying, ""I have no hesitation in saying that big companies get these financial and technical qualifications done as per their own calculation,"" while also clarifying that not all companies are involved in these manipulations.

Gadkari highlighted the influence of government officials in the decision-making process, stating, ""I feel that we run the government...our joint secretary, undersecretary is a guide and philosopher. And whatever he writes on the file is signed by the Director General (DG), and the minister also signs it in the same manner. This is how our Ramrajya runs.""
He noted that due to these manipulations, the costs of projects often escalate unnecessarily. However, he pointed out that through comprehensive studies and competition, costs could be reduced, citing the Zozila Tunnel project as an example.
""The project which was sanctioned for Rs 12,000 crore will be completed in Rs 5,200 or Rs 5,300 crore. This happened because of the competition,"" Gadkari said highlighting the effective planning and implementation in the project. (ANI)

"Industrial corridors to drive manufacturing, exports & jobs: Sanjay Nayar",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/industrial-corridors-to-drive-manufacturing-exports-jobs-sanjay-nayar/articleshow/112934331.cms,31-08-2024,"India is on the verge of a transformative leap in its industrial landscape with the recent approval of 12 new industrial nodes under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (
NICDP
). The initiative, approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, envisions a ""grand necklace"" of industrial smart cities along the backbone of the Golden Quadrilateral. With an investment of ₹28,602 crore, these projects are set to redefine India's industrial geography by strengthening a vibrant ecosystem of large industries and
MSMEs
.
Strategically being planned across 10 states along 6 major corridors, these projects represent a significant leap forward in India's quest to enhance its
manufacturing
capabilities and economic growth. It will spur
economic growth
in underdeveloped regions and reduce regional disparities by transforming these regions into industrial powerhouses. This integrated approach has a significant socio-economic impact by promoting inclusive growth and contributing to sustained economic development in the regions, accelerating investments from both large anchor industries and MSMEs, creating 10 lakh jobs directly and another 30 lakh indirectly.
The development of these
industrial corridors
under the NICDP is set to be a major catalyst for positioning India as a global manufacturing hub. Designed to create a synchronized industrial ecosystem, these corridors feature robust transportation networks, reliable energy supplies, advanced telecommunications, and sustainable urban environments. These futuristic greenfield projects are in line with India's vision of creating a vibrant industrial ecosystem that will act as a catalyst for achieving $2 trillion in exports by 2030.
Unlike low-cost manufacturing units of the past, these cities will boast ICT-enabled utilities, green technologies to minimize environmental impact, plug and play infrastructure and seamless connectivity. The cities will be equipped with water, power, gas, and telecom connectivity, along with rail, dedicated freight corridors, national highways, airports, and ports. India currently accounts for only 2.87% of global manufacturing. In comparison, China accounts for 31.63% and the US for 15.87%. Over the last few years, India has been focusing on attracting investments in manufacturing from frontier sectors like semiconductor, electronic goods manufacturing and extraction of critical mineral blocks. It has been offering industry-specific incentives and financial packages along with entering into technical collaborations across the globe.
While the hubs have immense potential, it is essential to address several challenges to fully realize the larger goal. Most manufacturers wanting to invest in India face challenges posed by land acquisition and environmental clearances. Despite the government's efforts to expedite these processes, there are still hurdles that can lead to delays and increased costs for businesses. By aligning land acquisition policies with the broader objectives of ease of doing business, the government can facilitate smoother transitions for investors looking to set up operations in these corridors.

These smart cities, which are expected to be ready in a record three years, having dealt with these issues in advance, will encourage manufacturers to set up operations in India, with its advantages of skilled manpower, geographical location with easy access to major regions of the world via its extensive coastline and political stability.
In essence, the recent industrial corridor initiative, if executed effectively, has the potential to propel India to the forefront of global manufacturing. By tacking ease of doing business from the core, by facilitating logistics, providing plug and play facilities and strengthening connectivity, these corridors should be more than just infrastructure projects, serving as catalysts for economic transformation. This will drive India towards becoming a global manufacturing powerhouse, ultimately contributing to the realization of a 'Viksit Bharat'. A rework of the industry-friendly policies, in consultation with industry bodies, would speed up our journey.

road transport
and highways ministry plans to build
public transport
and terminal infrastructure across India to centralise all transportation systems, including
roadways
,
railways
,
airways
, waterways and ropeways, into a single location to streamline passenger experience and significantly enhance convenience for users.
The move is aimed at improving the efficiency of freight and passenger movement in the country as such terminals will act as a one-stop solution for interfacing and interconnecting different modes of transport to cater to 87% of the passenger traffic moving through roads in the country, said officials.
The plan is to develop two pilot hubs in Katra and Tirupati and another two in Varanasi and Nagpur through the
National Highways Logistics Management
, a fully owned company of the National Highways Authority of India under the road transport and highways ministry.
“Development of public transport and terminal infrastructure will have multiple socio-economic benefits and help in improving passenger experience, reducing urban congestion and improving economic activity through creation of city centres,” said one of the officials, who did not wish to be identified.
Live Events
The government is of the view that travellers often face challenges navigating through fragmented transport systems, including state-run buses, metros, rickshaws and auto-rickshaws, and navigating city roads congested with hotels and lounges.
“By integrating various modes of transportation, public transport and terminal infrastructure seeks to simplify journeys for passengers, providing seamless connectivity and facilitating easy transfers between different modes of transport,” the official said.
As per the plan, these hubs will have a transport zone as well as a commercial zone. The transport zone will have a state-of-the-art public transport bus terminal catering to interstate, intercity, regional and local public transport buses, with provisions to connect other transport mode terminals such as metro station, ropeway terminal and railway station in the vicinity.
They will also provide other facilities such as bus bays, car parking facilities, taxi stands, toilets, baby care rooms, passenger lounges and waiting rooms, retail shops and electric vehicle charging stations.
The commercial zone, on the other hand, will house hotels, commercial complexes, restaurants and recreational facilities.

Govt directs NHAI to focus on upgrading existing national highways,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/govt-directs-nhai-to-focus-on-upgrading-existing-national-highways/articleshow/112611997.cms,18-08-2024,"New Delhi: The government has directed the
National Highways
Authority of India (
NHAI
) to focus on upgrading the existing national highways, amid increasing concerns over their maintenance and upkeep.
It marks a shift from the current practice of the NHAI focusing solely on the development of new
highways
and expressways under the
Bharatmala Pariyojana
and the
road transport
and highways ministry directly implementing these projects.
ET has seen a copy of the directive.
The focus has shifted to the existing highways because the
finance ministry
has paused sanction of new road projects under the Bharatmala Pariyojana due to high project cost and fund issues, said a senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.
Experts said this could ease congestion on many highways while ensuring their upkeep. ""National Highways (Original) projects are more bent towards upgradation and maintenance unlike greenfield ones. Hence, the economic impact will be more on ease of congestion,"" said Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, global head of consulting, Crisil Market Intelligence and Analytics.

As per the NHAI directive, the authority will take up 79 National Highways (Original) projects spanning about 1,421 km at an estimated cost of ₹1,44,392 crore in this financial year.
The scheme has two categories of projects - NHO1 and NHO2 - focused on the maintenance and upgrade of the existing national highways network.
NHO1 projects involve maintenance, repair and minor upgrades of the original national highways, while NHO2 projects often include more extensive upgrades and modernisation of the original national highways, aimed at enhancing the capacity and safety of the highways, accommodating increased traffic and improving overall efficiency.
Of the ₹1,44,392 crore, ₹71,112 crore is to be spent on NHO1 projects and ₹73,280 crore on NHO2 projects.
As per the prioritised plan of the NHAI for 2024-25, approved by the road transport and highways ministry, 39 projects have been identified under NHO1 and 40 projects under NHO2.
""The ministry will now undertake these projects through the NHAI after cabinet approval,"" the official said. ""However, this shift could significantly slow the creation of new greenfield highways and expressways in the current financial year.""
Bihar leads the list of states in the number of national highways to be undertaken by the NHAI this year under the NH (O) scheme, followed by Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.

A vital link between West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and the North-East, the Kharagpur-Moregram corridor is set to play a crucial role in regional development.
By increasing traffic capacity by over five times, this project will greatly improve travel efficiency, making the North-East more accessible and fostering economic growth across these states.
This corridor is strategically important for linking industrial regions in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan to major ports in Maharashtra. By enhancing logistics efficiency, it will boost industrial growth and support the seamless movement of goods across these critical industrial hubs, cementing India's position as a global manufacturing powerhouse.
The
Ayodhya Ring Road project
is set to transform the pilgrimage experience for millions of devotees visiting the sacred Ram Mandir. By facilitating quicker and smoother travel, this project will not only enhance the spiritual journey but also support regional tourism and infrastructure development, making Ayodhya more accessible to pilgrims from across the country.
The development of the Pathalgaon and Gumla sections of the Raipur-Ranchi corridor will provide a critical link between the mining areas of Gumla, Lohardaga, Raigarh, Korba, and Dhanbad with industrial zones in Raipur, Durg, Bilaspur, and Bokaro.
This corridor will facilitate faster and more efficient transportation, promoting industrial growth and economic development in these regions.
The completion of the 6-lane National Highway Ring around Kanpur, through the Kanpur Ring Road project, is expected to reduce congestion and enhance traffic flow within the city.
This project will not only improve travel within Kanpur but also ensure smoother and faster connectivity to other regions, transforming the city's urban landscape.
The Northern Guwahati Bypass project, which includes upgrading the existing bypass and constructing a major bridge over the Brahmaputra, will be a game-changer for connectivity in Assam. This project will greatly improve travel efficiency, reduce travel time, and support regional development, making Guwahati a more accessible and economically vibrant city.
The Nashik Phata - Khed corridor will significantly enhance travel between Pune and Nashik along NH-60. By reducing congestion around the bustling industrial area of Pimpri-Chinchwad, this corridor will foster industrial growth and ensure smoother transportation, reinforcing the region's industrial backbone.
These
high-speed road corridors
represent a stride towards realizing India's vision of seamless connectivity and robust infrastructure. As these projects progress, they are expected to not only transform travel but also catalyse economic growth, regional development, and industrial expansion across the nation.
With these initiatives, India is poised to take a giant leap forward in its journey towards becoming a global economic powerhouse.

"Gift City-like zones, IP-linked schemes key for manufacturing: PwC Chief Sanjeev Krishan",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/gift-city-like-zones-ip-linked-schemes-key-for-manufacturing-pwc-chief-sanjeev-krishan/articleshow/112411477.cms,10-08-2024,"India
can set up 5-6 massive zones for manufacturing, similar to the Gift City for financial services, as it moves towards its $1 trillion
goods exports
target,
PwC
India chairperson Sanjeev Krishan said.
He spoke to ET on a PwC India report released Friday that said India's $1 trillion goods export target can be achieved one year in advance by fiscal 2029 with appropriate measures.
The report, 'VIKSIT: An approach for India to achieve $1 trillion exports', offers a six-pillar framework for achieving the target.
""Can we have an outsized focus on manufacturing in a setup which is a very similar setup to what has been done for financial services in Gift City? It encourages you to produce ... creates a fair amount of employment generation and an entire ecosystem,"" Krishan told ET.
These could be outside the production-linked incentive (PLI) framework, he said. ""Maybe some of the elements of PLI are not required because it's a very different paradigm. It is a 10-year holiday and then by then, the hope is that you have embedded yourself and managed to scale enough.""

He said these
manufacturing zones
will have to be on a large geographic area and include the private sector. ""It is an entire ecosystem with connectivity and low factor cost so that productivity improves,"" Krishan added.
Only 1.36% of India's registered micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are exporting, revealing a gap between export growth and MSME internationalisation, he said, making a case for including them in the exports push. ""Challenges such as the business environment, export procedures, finance access and market information hinder
MSME exports
and must be addressed to unlock India's path to achieving $1 trillion in merchandise exports,"" he added.
This target of $1 trillion goods exports by 2030 is not an outstanding aspiration but only an interim one, he said, and called for creating Brand India for every product irrespective of the product category.
The country is looking at an export market of around $7.15 trillion being opened up by free-trade agreements, which can go up to $10 trillion, he said.
Many of the measures outlined in the report need support from states. ""It is a world of competitive federalism. I'm quite sanguine,"" he added.
Krishan said the private sector also has a role to play in this, especially the large Indian corporates who should be incentivised to invest. ""We should give credit to those who spend on innovation and IP creation besides corporate social responsibility. The aspiration of Indian businesses has to be higher,"" he said.
On the
Economic Survey
highlighting the need for Chinese investment, he said sometimes technical inputs or expertise are not available which constrain installing key equipment but now steps are being taken to ease those issues.
The PwC report says the six VIKSIT pillars - value addition and volume growth, infrastructure investments, knowledge sharing and capacity building, sustainable supply chain, inclusive industrialisation focused on MSMEs and technology enablement - have the potential to uncover new sector-specific opportunities to help achieve India's export ambitions.

World Bank
's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (
MIGA
) is to bolster its partnership with
India substantially
to help boost the country's
energy transition
and other development initiatives, its top officials told ET on Wednesday.
MIGA typically promotes cross-border investment in developing countries by providing guarantees and credit enhancement tools to induce investors and lenders to deploy funds in projects that may not otherwise gather investor interest.
MIGA now wants India to use its credit guarantee instruments to crowd in private investors in development projects, not just at home but also in other developing countries, they indicated.
""India is the best place to deploy guarantees. There is a huge need for infrastructure development. So, we did two transactions in the past six months. That's very unique. We want to use it more here,"" MIGA executive vice president
Hiroshi Matano
said, suggesting that there was ""plenty of room"" available for India to raise resources and find collaborations. Greater collaboration between MIGA and India also coincides with India's emergence as a leader of developing countries, Matano indicated. Energy, water, and infrastructure sectors are potential areas of deeper engagement with India, he said.
Earlier, MIGA had supported only one small project in India in 1997. But over the last six months, it signed up for a $317.5-million solar refinancing project with
State Bank of India
and a $132-million plan with
Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation

MIGA is holding discussions with senior Indian government officials as to how to strengthen the partnerships and allocate funds where they are most required, Matano said.
Talks with SIDBI
Junaid Kamal Ahmad
, vice-president (operations) at MIGA, said the organisation will soon have talks with Small Industries Development Bank of India- (SIDBI), which can use its guarantee to finance small and medium enterprises engaged in various development projects.
Ahmad said MIGA's credit guarantees are bolstering the ""leveraging part of the World Bank group and complementing the lending part."" He said Indian state-run financing entities, including SBI, could use MIGA guarantees to support projects in other developing countries. ""Every dollar of our economic capital that we put into a guarantee, we crowd in close to $20 of private finance,"" Ahmad said.
""There are those state-owned enterprises that are better suited for the domestic market (investment) and then there are those that are better suited to go abroad. Our purpose is to support platforms for scale and impact,"" he said.
Private capital in climate transition
Developing countries, said Matano, need trillions of dollars for climate change initiatives, and it would be impossible for multilateral agencies or the public sector alone to raise that much of resources. This warrants large-scale deployment of private capital that can be facilitated by MIGA through its guarantee instruments, he suggested.

in different states like the ones developed in Greater Noida,
Uttar Pradesh
and Dholera in Gujarat to further

, a top
government
official said. Out of this, two are coming up in Andhra Pradesh and one in Bihar.
The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (

has been created in four cities - Dholera (Gujarat), Auric (Maharashtra), Vikram Udyogpuri (Madhya Pradesh) and Krishnapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and allotment of land plots is underway for the industry.
Similarly in the other four, the government's special purpose vehicle is in the process of construction of the basic infrastructure like road connectivity, water and power supply.
With eight already under the
development
stage and the announcement of 12 new in the Budget, the total count of these cities in the country to 20, Singh told PTI.
Live Events
""These are industrial smart cities. These 12 new cities will make the count to 20. We built the trunk infrastructure and then gave the plots. We take environmental clearance for the entire city, so the company gets the 'plug and play' kind of things,"" he said, adding the department will approach the Union cabinet for the new ones.
The plans are ready and the land is with the state governments and ""We just have to approve the equity to the SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle), "" he added.
The move will help in increasing the share of manufacturing in the country's
GDP
and creating jobs.
Commenting on these smart cities announcements, Ashoo Gupta, Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said that this innovative reform, in collaboration with states and the private sector, can significantly boost industrial growth and city planning.
""These projects will become dynamic economic centres that drive development and innovation, creating a lasting impact. Usually, the government constructs essential infrastructure and provides land to industries, attracting investments by offering high-quality, dependable, eco-friendly, and robust infrastructure,"" Gupta added.
In the Budget 2024-25, the government has also announced other measures such as customs duty rationalisation to promote manufacturing and boost exports.

project finance
from lending institutions.
This will also be a big boost for all players in the value chain from EPC players to equipment suppliers. The current budget outlines an ambitious
capital expenditure
target of USD 133 billion, representing 3.4 percent of the GDP as infra spend.
This investment is intended to accelerate the implementation of major project across roads, railways and power sector. To realize this vision, over USD 20 billion in equity contributions from private entities would be required.

(b) the newly introduced Pumped Storage Policy which is in line with government's ambitions to move towards more grid friendly hybrid renewable projects and storage solutions
(c) green hydrogen via the National Green Hydrogen Mission
(d) EVs which will get a boost because of the Critical Mineral Mission
To implement the long-term target of
renewable energy
installation capacity i.e. 500 GW by 2030, additional c. 300 GW needs to be commissioned and this would entail capex of USD 160 Bn over next 5 years with an equity outlay of c. USD 40 Bn. This will need extensive investment in the supply chain and transmission network as these could be the potential road blocks.
Infrastructure development will need active participation of the states, especially for urban infrastructure and last mile connectivity and to accelerate that, the budget has allocated USD 18 Bn financing for states.

Budget 2024: Availability of land is a major hurdle in developing new airport in Bihar,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/budget-2024-availability-of-land-is-a-major-hurdle-in-developing-new-airport-in-bihar/articleshow/111953344.cms,23-07-2024,"Budget 2024: Establishment of a new
greenfield airport
in
Bihar
has again found impetus with Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
announcing in the budget speech that the government will establish airports, medical colleges, and sports infrastructure in Bihar.
Currently, there are three operational airports in Bihar- Gaya, Patna and Darbhanga.
However, the establishment of new airports in Bihar has time and again faced the hurdle of availability of land, government officials said.
For instance, for the growth of
civil enclave
at Bihta, which is a satellite town of Patna, Airport Authority of India (
AAI
) in 2016 had projected a land requirement of 191.5 acre for runway extension and 8 acre for apron extension and development of terminal side to make suitable for operation of wide-bodied aircraft.
However, the land is yet to be handed over by the state government.
Live Events
Similarly for the expansion of the Gaya Airport, a requirement of around 212 acres acres for expansion of Gaya Airport was forwarded to the Bihar government way back in 2017, which included 70 acres for runway extension, 30 acres for approach lights and 100 acres for future airport expansion.
“Subsequently, based on the site conditions, the land requirement was revised to 212.76 acres, which included 70 acres for runway extension, 42.76 acres for approach lights and 100 acres for future airport expansion. This was forwarded to the Bihar government in July 2017.
“Out of this, 23.84 acres have been handed over to AAI for approach lights, runway extension and for future airport expansion to be handed over by the state government,” the Ministry of Civil Aviation told a parliamentary standing committee last year.
Officials said that for a greenfield civil airport in Purnea, a feasibility study for development was conducted by AAI in July, 2015.
Since the airstrip is also used by the Indian Air Force, AAI had requested the state government for 50 acre of land for development of a New Civil Enclave. The State Government in June, 2022 informed that 52 acre of land has been acquired. However, the land was found unsuitable for development of the airport.
“AAI has requested the state government for additional land of 15 acres and assurance for 4 lane road connectivity to the airport site. The state government is yet to reply to the same,” a person aware of the development said.

PMGSY
) will be launched that will connect 25,000 rural habitations.

People familiar with the plans had earlier said the PMGSY revamp would focus on substantially expanding and upgrading the existing network of rural roads and linking them with nearby hubs and markets to bolster productive capacity of the economy and ensure ease of living.
Since its launch, about 0.8 million km of roads have been built under the scheme. Already three versions of the scheme—PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II and PMGSY-III—have been rolled out periodically by widening its scope and revamping the implementation method. Construction of roads identified has been completed above 90% in 18 states, with Goa touching 100%. But in certain hilly and north-eastern states, and Union territories, the completion is in the range of 58% to 89%.
A study on the impact of PMGSY, conducted by the World Bank in 2018, revealed that farm produce transported to markets for sale using roads built under the scheme increased 8% than before. The rate of primary employment in the non-farm sector rose about 13% because of the improved road network and the share of people with primary employment outside their habitation inched up 8%. Even the share of babies delivered at home dropped by 30% in connected habitations, leading to improved child mortality rate in
rural areas
, according to the study.

Private sector gross fixed capital formation (GCFC) in machinery and equipment and intellectual property products has grown cumulatively by just 35% in the four years through fiscal 2022-23. But its GFCF in ""dwellings, other buildings and structures"" increased by 105% during the period, it said.
""This is not a healthy mix,"" chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran wrote in the preface to the Survey.

A laggard approach by India Inc in these segments is the reason why there is a smaller number of higher-quality formal jobs than otherwise, the survey pointed out.
A slow pace of investment in these segments will delay India's quest to raise the
manufacturing
share of gross domestic product, it said.
""The government economists may be concerned since multiple policy interventions such as production-linked incentives (PLI) to boost local manufacturing have not yielded optimum results,"" said NR Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.
The Economic Survey estimates that the Indian economy needs to generate nearly 78.51 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce.
However, to create these many jobs, there is a need to provide the conditions for faster growth of productive jobs outside of agriculture, especially in organised manufacturing and services, even while improving productivity in the former.
""There needs to be complementary reforms in the services and
regulatory framework
of the country to boost manufacturing and create jobs. Speedily filling up vacancies in regulatory bodies is one such needed exercise that will go a long way in improving how businesses operate in the country,"" Bhanumurthy added.
According to the survey, capital formation in the private sector, after the consolidation in the second decade due to balance sheet issues, has begun to recover after Covid.
There is a need to improve private participation in funding
infrastructure projects
, the survey noted. The addition to the stock of infrastructure in the last five years owed predominantly to public sector financing, it said, adding that private sector participation is not forthcoming to the extent desired.
Focus now has to be on implementation of measures targeting to put the private sector non-residential investment (including equipment, structures, software and R&D) on a sustainable footing so that it can catalyse the efforts towards increasing investment to 35 % of
GDP
.

India needs to overhaul metrics used for measuring infrastructure utilisation: Eco Survey 2024,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/india-needs-to-overhaul-metrics-used-for-measuring-infrastructure-utilisation-eco-survey-2024/articleshow/111923988.cms,22-07-2024,"India needs to better track
infrastructure utilisation
rates for shedding light on sub-sectors where there is either an oversupply or a shortfall. To address these concerns, the
Economic Survey 2023-24
has recommended creating an index that tracks this metric.
According to the survey, existing databases fall short on assessing the demand for infrastructure and tracking the utilisation of facilities. While statistics on the infrastructure sector can be derived from several available databases, aggregation of information - on both financial flows and physical progress - is difficult now.
""A roadmap and an action plan for systematic collection of information on infrastructure-oriented financial flows are essential,"" the Survey has recommended while adding that project-wise and sector-wise information on physical progress, now maintained in different formats and frequencies, need to be reexamined and revised to facilitate a complete picture.
Vinayak Chatterjee, Founder and Managing Trustee at the Infravision Foundation, “The key macroeconomic index for infrastructure development is Gross fixed capital formation in infrastructure (GCFI) represented as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). India’s aspirational target is 8%.”
“However, the
economic survey
seems to allude to the fact that a statistical collection super- structure to agglomerate such data from central, state, village, panchayat, and Urban Local Bodies (ULB) level is still not in place,” he added.

In its commentary on the Indian economy, the survey said there is a need to improve data capture and reporting mechanisms for investments in infrastructure across instruments and sectors as well its composition across different projects on a granular level.
“The
Rangarajan Commission Report
on Infrastructure Statistics (2001) had underscored the importance of collecting and maintaining a reliable statistical database for the infrastructure sector. Major strides have been made since then to collect data on policy direction, institutional strength, project performance and monitoring. However, data gaps persist in some key areas,” the Survey highlighted.
Commenting on the need for better monitoring infrastructure spend as well, the survey pointed out that analysis of the capital expenditure of the State Governments is not possible. This is because the data on the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) by the State Government to the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and the resources mobilised by SPSEs themselves are not available in a consolidated form.

power plants
of
Northern India
has been reduced by 30-40% with the operationalization of Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor. This is leading to a significant reduction in the inventory costs of power plants.
“With the running of trains over WDFC, the freight transit time between the ports of Western India and North India has been reduced by almost 50%,” the statement said while highlighting the successful transportation of perishable commodity (milk) in a much reduced time from the dairies of Gujarat to the National Capital Region (NCR).

NHAI to charge double user fee in case of non-affixation of FASTag on the front windshield,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/nhai-to-charge-double-user-fee-in-case-of-non-affixation-of-fastag-on-the-front-windshield/articleshow/111840632.cms,19-07-2024,"Those travelling on national highways without a
FASTag
affixed on the windscreen will have to pay double the user fee at the toll plazas. The National Highways Authority of India has issued guidelines to collect double user fee from such users entering the toll lane with non-affixed FASTag on
front windshield
from the inside to deter such a move.
The
NHAI
is of the view that the deliberate non-affixation of FASTag on the windscreen leads to unnecessary delays at the toll plazas causing inconvenience to the fellow National Highway users.
“This initiative of charging double user fee from non-affixation of FASTag will help to make toll operations more efficient and ensure seamless and comfortable journey for the national highway users,” NHAI said.
In a statement issued on Thursday, NHAI said detailed standard operating procedures (SOP) has been issued to all user fee collection agencies and concessionaires to charge double user fee in case of non-affixation of FASTag on the front windshield.
Live Events
“The information will also be prominently displayed at all user fee plazas, informing highway users about the penalties for non-compliance of entering a toll lane without a fixed FASTag on the front windshield,” it said.
“In addition, CCTV footage with vehicle registration number (VRN) at the fee plaza shall be recorded of the non-affixed FASTag cases,” it said, adding this will help in maintaining proper record regarding the fee charged and presence of the vehicle in the toll lane.
The move is aimed at enforcing the standard procedural guidelines for affixation of FASTag on the front windshield of the assigned vehicle from inside and any FASTag that is not affixed on the assigned vehicle as per standard process is not entitled to carry out electronic toll collection (ETC) transaction at a user fee plaza and will have to pay
double toll
fee as well as can be duly blacklisted, NHAI said.
Issuer banks have also been directed to ensure fixation of the FASTag to the assigned vehicle on the front windshield at the time of issuance from various point-of-sale (POS).
NHAI collects user fee on National Highways as per the National Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008. At present, user fee is collected for approximately 45,000 km of national highways and expressways at around 1,000 toll plazas on National Highways across the country.
With a penetration rate of around 98%, currently India has over 80 million FASTag users.

"Ambitious Delhi-Mumbai expressway project misses revised 2024 target, delayed further to 2025",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/ambitious-delhi-mumbai-expressway-project-misses-revised-2024-target-delayed-further-to-2025/articleshow/111803533.cms,17-07-2024,"The ambitious
Delhi-Mumbai expressway
project, touted as a game-changer for Indian infrastructure, faces significant delays primarily due to
land-related challenges
in Gujarat. According to Times of India sources, two crucial segments totaling 62 kilometers in
Gujarat
only saw bidding commence in November 2023, while construction on one of these segments began in April this year, and the other started just this month.
Initially slated for completion by January 2023, the project has encountered multiple setbacks, pushing the revised target to March 2024, which has also been missed. Sources reveal that constructing each stretch requires a minimum of eighteen months. To expedite progress, the project was divided into smaller 'packages' for faster execution. Officials assure that all outstanding
land acquisition
issues are being actively addressed.
Presently, approximately 630 kilometers of the total 1,386 kilometers have been opened to traffic in various segments. Notable sections include Sohna-Dausa-Sawai Madhopur (293 km) and Jhalawar-MP/Gujarat border (245 km). Authorities express confidence that the 845-kilometer stretch from Sohna to Vadodara will be fully operational by March 2025. Subsequent sections, crucially linking to Mumbai's JNPT port, Jewar Airport in Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi's DND Flyway, are expected to follow suit.
Former
NHAI officials
highlight the critical role of timely land acquisition in such projects, emphasizing proactive steps by state governments. A former official said, ""Non-availability of land is the biggest hurdle in the execution of
road projects
, especially for greenfield expressways.""
In a recent development, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways disclosed that contracts worth Rs 3,633 crore and Rs 2,287 crore were awarded for constructing 35 km in Valsad and 27 km in Navsari districts, respectively, yet actual construction has not commenced in these areas.
Live Events
Despite significant progress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Gujarat's slow pace remains a concern. With work now initiated across all packages, officials express optimism that the entire expressway will be operational by October next year, significantly enhancing connectivity between Delhi and Mumbai.

PM GatiShakti platform may adopt AI to boost India’s economic development,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/soon-ai-powered-pm-gatishakti-platform-to-boost-indias-economic-development-official/articleshow/111638976.cms,22-07-2024,"The Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led
NDA 3.0 government
is ""considering"" leveraging
artificial intelligence
(
AI
) as a part of an advanced version of the
PM GatiShakti
platform, to fast-track
infrastructure
development in the country.
""We are looking at having a next version of futuristic PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan, which we call as PMGS 2.0 or AI-enabled predictive platform, where we can imagine various scenarios and make an assessment of what is going to be the trends for
economic development
, which area or sector, and at what pace,"" Surendra Kumar Ahirwar, Joint Secretary -
Logistics
at the Department of Commerce told ET.
The official further said that the initial preparatory work is on to develop such a platform that could boost economic development by intelligently undertaking risk assessment, adding that the department is always at forefront in adopting new technologies.
Considering various scenarios - optimistic, business as usual or pessimistic scenarios, the AI-backed system would be able to analyse and foresee for the economic and sectoral development, including probable growth rate, and infrastructure requirement accordingly, if it is implemented, he said.
In October 2021, the Centre launched PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS-NMP) was launched for improving
multimodal connectivity
infrastructure to various economic activities in line with Aatmanirbharta (self reliance) and a vision of $5 trillion economy by 2025,
Live Events
The national initiative, with integrated planning and synchronised project implementation across departments and state governments, incorporated a dynamic Geospatial data platform to derive logistics efficiency by addressing critical infrastructure gaps.
""There have been more than 170 projects which have been evaluated in the last two years which value about Rs 13.5 lakh crores. Some of them are there coming to either fruition or in the implementation stage. This is a big way we are utilizing the digital technology which is the PM
Gati Shakti Master Plan
platform, which is helping us make these infrastructure projects more multimodal, efficient, and more connected to the industrial or other economic nodes.
As many as 48 Union ministries, and all the states and Union Territories have already boarded the PM Gati Shakti platform.
In FY 22-23, the government disbursed around Rs 5,000 crores to states. With the special capital assistance scheme of the Ministry of Finance, more than Rs 1 lakh crore will be given to various states in FY 2024-25, Ahirwar said.
In 2022, the Centre unveiled a scheme for special assistance, and offered financial assistance to the states in the form of a 50-year interest free loan for capital investments.
Logistics sector remains at the forefront in adopting advanced technologies, according to him.
""Nearly 37 digital systems of the logistics sector in various ministries have been integrated to the ULIP (Unified Logistics Interface Platform) which has become almost the UPI in terms of the data it has for the logistics sector.""
Industries are looking to embrace AI to enhance efficiencies while the use of AI and machine learning (AI-ML) technology can transform the logistics industry including lowering the costs.
The top official further said that the logistics cost is relatively higher in India and that needs a reduction.
""India has a huge potential. It requires to realise that potential in terms of infrastructure development in terms of economic and social development, and should be able to address the cause of employment to a greater extent than what have been able to hitherto"", he said.
The department also has a data-driven index Logistics Ease Across Different States (Leads), focussing on providing a common platform for a consultative and
collaborative framework for Central and State Governments to work in a coordinated manner in the logistic sector for achieving ease of logistics.
""Logistics is an outcome of infrastructure, technology and people in the processes. So, we cannot just say that one factor can determine an entire efficiency of the logistics sector. So, it has to be a concerted effort and the realization can only be attained through an integrated approach."" the official added.

Government of India
to continue its focus on
infrastructure development
.
The Interim Budget 2024-25 had allocated an impressive ₹11.1 lakh crore for capital investment in infrastructure, which was a 11 % increase over the previous year's budget. This allocation constituted 3.4% of India's projected GDP for 2024-25, up from 3.3% in the previous year. However the growth rate was lower compared to the previous year's 34% increase. Yet considering the fiscal challenges that the Government faces, this did demonstrate its commitment to infrastructure spend.
The Government continues to face similar challenges going ahead as well and we can expect a lot of emphasis on measures in the upcoming July 2024 that increase the bang for the buck.
In this context, some suggestions keeping this philosophy under consideration are the following:
It is imperative to expedite implementation of ongoing projects. A lot more focus would be on project monitoring and tracking the progress of key projects and ensure timely completion. The Government would do well to provide incentives to Project authorities and executing companies to complete their projects within the scheduled timelines.
Bring in
private sector investment
is really going to be critical considering the limited fiscal space the Government has in increasing its own capital spend. Therefore we can expect more attractive viability gap funding and other incentives to attract private investment in infrastructure projects, Modifications in the viability gap guidelines and changes to PPP approval guidelines may be considered.
With the increasing impact of climate change, a lot more focus on sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure can be expected. I would expect allocation of specific funds for development of green corridors, and circular economy projects etc to promote
sustainable infrastructure
, We could also see specific tax incentives and subsidies for the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy solutions in infrastructure projects.
While the Government of India has been focusing on simplifying regulations, a focused initiative to support the implementation of
regulatory reforms
and address bottlenecks may be considered. This has been deliberated with the Government as well.
It is imperative to allocate funds for the development of digital infrastructure, to support the integration of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in infrastructure projects, There could be specific grants and incentives for the adoption of AI led solutions in infrastructure planning, construction, and maintenance to improve efficiency and reduce costs,
In addition to the above, I would like to see more focus in the budget on sectors and areas that need greater thrust going forward.
BUDGET 2024 EXPECTATIONS
Tourism is one of the sectors that has significant linkages to various economic sectors. Investing in
tourism infrastructure
can have significant benefits to the local economy and enhances employment opportunities amongst others. The benefits also reach the remotest parts of the country. It would be very helpful to enhance the budgets for various tourism programs like Swadesh Darshan and enhance the scope and scale significantly.
Water continues to be one of the significant challenges that the country will face considering the significant variability in availability due to climate change and declining quality. Continued investments both in irrigation, and drinking water as well as industrial water is necessary. Water is a complicated area and there are significant investment needs across the value chain. Bringing in climate resilient source sustainability, focus on water quality, improvement in operational efficiency would need to be encouraged in this budget.
Safety continues to be an important focus in both railways and highways. We can expect focused allocation on these critical aspects especially in the light of recent tragic incidents.

SC declines to stay Bombay HC proceedings against MEP Infrastructure,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/sc-declines-to-stay-bombay-hc-proceedings-against-mep-infrastructure/articleshow/111585479.cms,08-07-2024,"The
Supreme Court
on Monday refused to stay the
proceedings
before the
Bombay High Court
that restrained toll company
MEP Infrastructure
, which had
defaulted payment
of Rs 5,500 crore to the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi
(MCD), from disposing of its shareholdings in any of its 31 subsidiary companies. The HC had also asked these 31 firms to give details of their assets.
A Bench led by Justice Sanjiv Khanna dismissed the debt-laden MEP's appeal that sought stay on the court proceedings on the grounds that the attachment of properties could not have been passed since the
National Company Law Tribunal
had on March 28 admitted it to CIRP and a moratorium order under Section 14 had come into force.
Challenging the HC various orders that directed its 31 companies to give details of its assets, as called for by the Tehsildar,
MEP
said that the HC failed to appreciate that it is a well settled proposition of law that applicability of the provisions of Section 14 against a company also includes execution of suits and proceedings.
The company said that it was unable to pay the agreed weekly toll remittances of Rs 23.12 crore due to
Covid pandemic
.
The HC has “erred” in not appreciating that once the petition under Section 7 of the IBC is admitted, no proceedings can be continued against the corporate debtor i.e. MEP, the appeal stated.
Live Events
The HC had passed a series of orders on the two petitions by MCD, which is entrusted with the collection of toll tax from commercial vehicles entering Delhi from 124 toll points around the capital, seeking recovery of Rs 3927 crore with interest from MEP Infrastructure towards toll tax and environmental compensation charge between 2017 and 2020. The corporation had also sought directions to attach and recover shares owned by the company in its 31 subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The HC had observed that “such recovery is of public money, hence, it concerns an issue involving immense public interest.”
The MCD had issued warrants of distress or recovery certificates for attaching MEP’s properties for recovering tax arrears. Since some of these properties were located in Maharashtra, the municipal body had sought assistance from the state district collectors under the Revenue Recovery Act.
While MCD's petitions against MEP under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code were dismissed by NCLT, Mumbai Bench and also by the
NCLAT
since there was a 'pre-existing dispute', the HC had allowed the municipal body's plea to take action against the company for recovery of dues from MEP as arrears of land revenue.
MCD had contended that for want of funds the salaries payable to its employees are adversely affected, as such payment is being systematically defeated.

NHAI
is identifying vulnerable locations that may be severely impacted due to rains and is in talks with the district administration to work on an alternative diversion plan for uninterrupted travel experience. Besides, it is working with the local authorities and administration, both in the hilly areas as well as plains, to mobilise machinery and manpower to the flood- and landslide-prone locations.
""To ensure availability of resources for effective disaster preparedness, NHAI has initiated shifting of required equipment from less flooding locations to flood-prone areas,"" the official said.

Delhi Airport disaster raises concern over Modi’s building spree,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/delhi-airport-disaster-raises-concern-over-modis-building-spree/articleshow/111355488.cms,29-06-2024,"The deadly roof collapse at India’s busiest airport is the latest in a string of recent
infrastructure disasters
in the country, raising safety questions as Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
spends billions of dollars to improve transportation across the country.
Officials at Delhi’s airport canceled operations at Terminal 1 after an outdoor metal canopy collapsed during torrential rainfall on Friday. Multiple cars were crushed outside the airport, which was recently renovated, killing one person and injuring eight, according to the authorities. The area recorded its heaviest one-day June rainfall in 88 years that day.
Several hundred kilometers east, in the state of Bihar, four bridges recently collapsed and a structure at an airport in central India caved in. With the start of the monsoon season, water-logging is now the norm in many cities. In Ayodhya, the roof of a massive temple inaugurated by
Modi
earlier this year has been leaking, and flooding has inundated newly built roads, according to local reports.
The issues cast a harsh spotlight on Modi’s building spree, which officials are leaning on to boost development in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. According to Bloomberg Economics, 44.4 trillion rupees ($532 billion) worth of new infrastructure will become operational over the next two years. That figure equals the value of all projects built in the last 11 years.
Modi has presided over ribbon-cutting ceremonies at many of them. Modernizing infrastructure was a key part of his pitch to voters during this year’s national election, when he won a third term as prime minister. Over the last decade, his government says it’s built 80 new airports, upgraded railways and expanded highways by many thousands of kilometers.

Niranjan Sahoo, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, says Friday’s disaster at Terminal 1 raises fresh questions about the quality of India’s infrastructure. “It puts the country, which aspires to be a global power, in a very poor light,” he said, calling many of the projects an “electoral gimmick.”
Economists and business leaders have justified a big budget for infrastructure, arguing that it’s necessary to turbo-charge India’s growth and build out the nation’s manufacturing sector. As China’s economy slows, many international companies are looking to the South Asian nation as an alternative for their factories. Bloomberg Economics expects the infrastructure drive to help lift
economic growth
to 9% by 2030, up from 8.2% in the last fiscal year.
India’s opposition leaders, however, have criticized some of the projects, calling them wasteful and rife with corruption. They’ve accused Modi of diverting resources and attention from reducing poverty or unemployment. The country’s infrastructure is “falling like a deck of cards,” Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the opposition Indian National Congress party, wrote on X.
Officials attempted damage control after Friday’s incident outside Terminal 1. India’s aviation minister, Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, said the structure that collapsed wasn’t part of the recent renovations. “The building inaugurated by PM Modi is on the other side,” he said.
Still, the disaster at the very least suggests poor maintenance, Sahoo said, and gives Modi’s critics fresh fodder to attack his record.
“Infrastructure is just not about building those bridges, airports and ports and roads,” he said. “It is also about governance. It is about maintaining them.”

Morgan Stanley
has all praise for
PM Gati Shakti scheme
.
The report says India has scaled up its infrastructure strongly over the last decade, investment is not only increasing but it is better targeted and potentially more productive. The report further adds India's thrust on
infrastructure spending
is set to continue.
The report said, ""We expect
India's infrastructure
investment to steadily increase from 5.3 per cent of GDP in F24 to 6.5 per cent of GDP by F29. Indeed, this implies that infrastructure investments are expected to register a strong 15.3 per cent CAGR, resulting in cumulative spending of USD 1.45 trillion over the next five years. In our view, this will help to lift the investment rate, leading to a sustained period of high productive growth.""
According to the report, contrary to popular perception, India's physical infrastructure scale already compares favorably to China's when viewed in the context of GDP differential.
Talking about PM
Gati Shakti
scheme, it says it has given a new filip to the infrastructure development and
multi-modal connectivity
. The report cites
World Bank
's Logistics Index Report, 2023, it says the average Container Dwell Time in India was three days compared to four days for countries like the UAE and South Africa, seven days for the USA, and 10 days for Germany.

revenue
,
road transport
and
highways
minister
Nitin Gadkari
said.
Speaking at the international workshop on GNSS-based
electronic toll collection
in India, Gadkari said since commercial vehicles including trucks account for 75% of annual toll revenue it is important that the new system is implemented on commercial vehicles first.
“GNSS will add another Rs 10,000 crore to the toll revenue and remove 99% of the existing loopholes in the system,” Gadkari said.
“We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of
GNSS-based toll collection
in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added.
India’s toll collection stood at Rs 64,809.86 crore in 2023-24 as against Rs 48,028.22 crore in 2022-23, an increase of 34.9%.
Live Events
The government feels the GNSS-based toll collection will enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and will be a major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance traveled.
The
National Highways Authority of India
, under the ministry of road transport and highways, has invited bids to develop and implement GNSS-based electronic toll collection system in India in a phased manner over the next two years.
“We hope to put in place the system for GNSS-based toll collection by December and cover 4000-5000 km of highways before the end of this financial year,”
NHAI
chairman Santosh Yadav said.
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based tolling is a barrier free method of electronic toll collection wherein the road users are charged on the distance they have travelled on the tolled highway stretch. The system uses satellites or constellations of satellites to track vehicle’s movement and calculate tolls based on the distance travelled on tolled highways.
NHAI plans to implement the GNSS-based Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system within the existing
FASTag
ecosystem, initially using a hybrid model where both RFID-based ETC and GNSS-based ETC will operate simultaneously.
The plan is to introduce GNSS based tolling initially on 2000 km of national highways in the first three months after the award of the contract and extended to 10000 km in nine months, 25000 km of tolled highways in 15 months and 50,000 km of tolled highways or pan-India in two years. The concessionaire will be expected to operate and maintain the toll plaza for 10 years.
Presently electronic toll collection in India is done through radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, branded as FASTag, since 2015.
Since February 2021, FASTag has been made mandatory for the payment of user fees at national highway toll plazas. At present, user fee is collected for approximately 45,000 km of national highways (NH) and expressways in approximately 1200 toll plazas maintained by the National Highways Authority of India or concessionaires.

In 1999, when the project was awarded to the Siemens-led consortium, the contract term stipulated that the union government cannot allow a second airport within a radius of 150 kilometers till 2033. With nine years to go for the clause to cease, it was time for the government to begin planning a second airport for the fast-expanding city, Patil said.
The current international airport, according to him, is projected to reach its peak passenger handling capacity by 2033 and its maximum cargo handling capacity by 2040.
Considering that land acquisition and compensation for landowners take a significant amount of time, Patil stressed the need to begin work on the second airport immediately.
Infrastructure department secretary N Manjula, Karnataka Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation MD BC Satisha and Karnataka State Industrial Investment & Development Corporation executive director DP Prakasha were present at the meeting.

Get InvITs under purview of bankruptcy law: SBI MD,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/get-invits-under-purview-of-bankruptcy-law-sbi-md/articleshow/111170136.cms,21-06-2024,"Mumbai:
Infrastructure
investment trusts (InvITs) are enjoying immunity from insolvency proceedings and should be brought under the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
, a top official from
SBI
said on Friday. Ashwini Kumar Tewari, the managing director of the bank, said
lenders
need the assurance of being able to recover their dues from
InvITs
in case of a default and added that they are in touch with the Reserve Bank and the government on the same.
""We need to bring these trusts, which are
bankruptcy
remote, within the purview of the IBC because that will go a long way in giving us the assurance that this is like any other asset,"" Tewari said, addressing an
NBFC
event organized by industry lobby Assocham here.
He elaborated that at present, the primary responsibility of an InvIT or a special purpose vehicle under it is towards the trust holders and there are ""gaps"" which need to be filled.
""This space needs clarification; this space needs assurance to the lenders that in case there is a (legal) testing of default etc, it will be the same as any other lending that they do within this space (infrastructure),"" he said.
Tewari mentioned that banks also lack the power to change
management
at entities, which is a key feature under the IBC provisions and has already been invoked in the past.

He also made it clear that
SBI
is ""very bullish"" on the InvITs space because it takes away the long-term risk from the bank after a project is completed, and also because it provides steady flow of cash to pension funds and other investors.
The IBC was promulgated in December 2019 while InvIT saw the maiden listing in 2017.
Meanwhile, Tewari also questioned the need for a non-banking financial company (NBFC) to have a long list of lenders, and pitched for consortium arrangements in the same.
""'We feel that if there are so many banks involved, each with a smaller share and yet the overall credit size is large, the only conclusion which can be drawn is the follow-up, and the control mechanism on the portfolio then is so much lesser. And that is something we are not very comfortable with,"" he said.
Making it clear that SBI has flagged the issue to the
RBI
, Tewari said banks do not want any caps on the number of relationships an NBFC keeps.
At present, a bank gets a separate list of debtors, and has to do a sample check on every account, which is ""not a good way"" to handle large exposures, Tewari said, adding that in case of a similar sized manufacturing or a services company, the number of bank relationships is much smaller.
If this sector has to sustain, this particular issue needs to be resolved, he added.
Tewari welcomed the higher awareness levels and strength among NBFCs in southern India on internal audit and said this helps reduce any instances of risks.
The heightened regulatory scrutiny of the NBFC sector is courtesy the stress faced by the sector after the IL&FS crisis in 2018-19, and also the growth which we have witnessed, he said.
At present, over half of the NBFC sector's funding requirements are funded by the banks and the risks coming from this have to be taken on board, Tewari said, advocating similar regulation between banks and NBFCs.
Domestic rating agency
Icra
's group head for financial sector ratings, Karthik Srinivasan said the banking industry's exposure to NBFCs is at an all-time high of over a tenth of the overall portfolio and added that NBFCs which are able to maintain better credit quality will not face any challenges on funding.
There are some pockets where there are asset quality issues, he said, adding that some retail NBFCs have been growing the riskier unsecured books at double the pace of overall growth in assets under management.

road safety
.
The tentative length to be covered under this project shall be around 25,000 km, the ministry of road transport and highways said in a statement issued on Thursday.
As per the agreement,
IIIT Delhi
will conduct surveys for collecting imagery and other data related to availability and condition of road signages on selected national highways stretches.
The data collected through surveys will be processed by IIIT Delhi through deployment of Artificial Intelligence for accurate identification and classification of road signs.
The survey report based on the results will include geo-stamped inventory of existing road signs with the categorisation, broad structural condition of the road signs and other ancillary data.

The institute will also conduct a gap study that will be carried out by assessing the difference between the survey findings and the requirement of road signs as per the approved road signages plan of the respective contract agreement, the ministry said.
“The gap study shall additionally cover the requirements as per latest codal provisions relevant to high- speed corridors to cater the enhanced safety requirements,” it added.
As per the statement, the aim is to enhance road safety for all national highway users by harnessing the potential of Al and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).cing innovation and adopting advanced technologies.

""The next decade will see us invest over $100 billion in energy transition space and expand our integrated
renewable energy
value chain that today already spans the manufacturing of every major component required for green energy generation,"" he said.
The conglomerate is focusing on producing the ""world's least expensive green electron"" that will become the feedstock for several sectors that must meet the sustainability mandate.
""And to make this happen, we are building the world's largest single-site renewable energy park in Khavda in district of Kutch (Gujarat). Just this single location will generate 30 GW of power, thereby taking our total
renewable energy capacity
to 50 GW by 2030,"" he said.
On digital infrastructure, he said data is indeed the new oil, and at the heart of all the action is the data centre-the critical infrastructure needed to power all forms of computational needs, especially AI workloads for machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision and deep learning.
All of this is dependent on the ability to process data at an unprecedented speed and scale, which are the precise capabilities that
data centres
provide. However, this will need massive amounts of energy, making the data centre business the largest energy-consuming industry in the world, he said. ""This makes the energy transition even more complex and is raising electricity prices, thereby adding to the already high prices because of the combined impact of climate change and demand growth,"" Adani said.

's infrastructure story has been about foundations being laid between 1991-2014 and then the eventual take-off in the last decade,
Adani Group
chairman
Gautam Adani
said at an event on Wednesday.
""If the period between 1991 and 2014 was about putting down the foundations and building the runway the period from 2014 to 2024 has been about the aircraft taking off,"" the billionaire said at a CRISIL event in Mumbai.
Adani also said that the liberalisation policy tweak announced in 1991 by the then-Finance Minister Manmohan Singh marked a major turning point. ""The breaking down of the License Raj meant that the government did away with industrial licensing for most sectors. It eliminated much of the requirement for businesses to obtain government permission to invest, or set prices, or build capacity,"" he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA has been at the Centre since 2014. The BJP-led alliance was freshly voted to power for the next five years in June 2024 for the third consecutive term. Adani noted that the 'single most important catalyst' that led to this infrastructure boost has been the quality of governance seen in the last decade in India.
""India’s remarkable infrastructure journey is fundamentally rooted in this government’s effectiveness in institutionalizing policy for transforming our nation's landscape—from one of challenges—to one of possibilities,"" Adani said.

Giving an example of 'aircraft taking off', Adani spoke of the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP).
""The core essence of the NIP is its integrated approach involving participation from both the public and private sectors with the funding model divided between the two. I consider the NIP program that has earmarked a projected investment of Rs. 111 lakh crore over the period FY20-25 as a benchmark of how a government can put in place a national view of over 9,000 infrastructure projects across sectors like energy, logistics, water, airports, and social infrastructure,"" he added.
Will invest over $100 billion in energy transition space in next decade: Adani
The Adani Group intends to invest over a $100 billion in the energy transition space as it seeks to further expand its integrated renewable energy value chain, he said.
The billionaire said that in the days ahead, the availability of the green electron will be the primary driver of a nation’s economic progress. ""In my opinion the market size for the green electron as of now has no limits,"" he said.
""We are confident that we will produce the world’s least expensive green electron that will become the feedstock for several sectors that must meet the sustainability mandate. And to make this happen, we are already building the world’s largest single site renewable energy park in Khavda, in the district of Kutch,"" Adani added.
The company aims to generate 30 GW of power through its Khavda park, taking its total renewable energy capacity to 50 GW by 2030.

NHAI to undertake Miyawaki plantations along national highways to restore green cover,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/nhai-to-undertake-miyawaki-plantations-along-national-highways-to-restore-green-cover/articleshow/111090799.cms,18-06-2024,"The
National Highways
Authority of India (NHAI) will go the Japanese way for greening of national highways. To begin with,
NHAI
will undertake
Miyawaki plantations
, a unique Japanese approach to
ecological restoration
and
afforestation
, on 53 acres of land parcel adjacent to national highways in and around Delhi and the national capital region.
Based on the success of Miyawaki plantation in Delhi-NCR, the similar pattern will be replicated across the country, NHAI said in a statement on Tuesday.
According to NHAI, ground preparation has already started at the selected sites and plantations shall be taken up during the upcoming monsoon season and is scheduled to be completed by the end of August 2024.
“For successful implementation of the Miyawaki Plantation method, focus will be on the plantation of indigenous species of plants that can survive in the local climate and soil conditions,” it said.
The Miyawaki method aims to create dense, native, and
biodiverse forests
in a short period of time. These forests retain ground water and help to recharge the groundwater table. With this method, trees grow ten times faster and the plantations act as a sound and dust barrier.
Live Events
“Development of Miyawaki forests will contribute towards the creation of a
resilient ecosystem
, offering a range of benefits to both the environment and local community,” NHAI said, adding it will have multiple long-term benefits, including improvement in
micro-climatic conditions
as well as improved air and soil quality.
“It will also help in biodiversity conservation, rapid growth of
green cover
, efficient carbon absorption, soil restoration and in habitat creation for local flora and fauna,” NHAI added.
Some of the sites proposed for development of Miyawaki plantations along the national highways include 4.7 acres of land area along Haryana section of Dwarka Expressway, 4.1 acres near Sohna on Delhi – Vadodara section of Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, around 5 acres each at Chabri and Kharkhara interchanges on NH 152D of Ambala – Kotputli corridor in Haryana, over 12 acres at Shamli bypass on NH-709B, 9.2 acres at Duhai interchange on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway near Ghaziabad and 5.6 acres near Meerut-Najibabad section of NH-34 in Uttar Pradesh.

renewable energy
, roads and real estate are expected to grow by 38% in FY’25 and FY’26 compared with the previous two fiscals to Rs 15 lakh crore on the back of supportive policy interventions and improved credit profile,
CRISIL
Ratings said.
“The surge will ride on India’s need for creation of sustainable infrastructure by adding more green power to the energy mix, improving physical connectivity through a denser road network, as well as rising demand for residential and commercial real estate,” it said.
“The underlying demand drivers in these three sectors remain strong, with regular policy interventions fuelling investor interest,” Krishnan Sitaraman, senior director and chief ratings officer, CRISIL Ratings, said while speaking at its annual Infrastructure Summit 2024 held virtually.
“This has also supported healthy credit risk profiles of private players and strengthened their execution and funding capabilities,” Sitaraman added.
According to CRISIL Ratings, the key growth driver for renewables is demand for sustainable energy transition.

“The government’s target is driving up auctions, which has created a strong pipeline. India saw auctions of 35 GW in fiscal 2024, the highest ever in a single fiscal, resulting in a strong pipeline of 75 GW. This will primarily drive implementation of 50 GW capacity over the next two fiscals,” it said.
Further, the need for improved physical connectivity in the roads sector has led to healthy awarding over the past few fiscal years, barring the last one.
“Strengthened order books of road developers, at 2.5 times of revenue, will support 11% growth in highway construction, which is seen at 12,500 km per year over the next two fiscals,” it added.
CRISIL Ratings said the real estate sector is expected to see 8-10% jump in demand for commercial office space this fiscal and the next while demand for residential real estate will sustain at 8-12% this fiscal and the next, aided by favourable affordability.
“The primary drivers of the same will be global capability centres eyeing India’s large talent pool and competitive rentals, as well as healthy demand from domestic sectors,” it added.
As per the CRISIL Ratings, cumulatively over Rs 2 lakh crore of equity capital has been deployed in these sectors over the past two fiscals driven by strong investor participation.
“A key enabler here has been the emergence of vehicles such as infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The capital inflows from investors have helped improve credit profiles of private players, thus strengthening their ability to fund future growth,” it added.
However, there are some risks to watch out for as the growth momentum could be impacted if these play out in a meaningful way, it said.
“In renewables, timely commissioning of storage and storage-linked capacities remains a key risk given their higher tariffs compared with the usual renewable capacities,” it said.
Similarly, the moderation in government budgetary allocation to the roads sector could be a risk. “Amendments in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) toll model concession agreement have been made to increase private participation. However, improvement in traffic estimation accuracy and increase in willingness of lenders to fund BOT toll projects will bear watching,” it cautioned.
“In real estate, while reduction in inventory in recent years has added to the resilience of the sector, discipline in new launches and, consequently, the impact on inventory going ahead will remain monitorable,” it added.

at the earliest, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways
Nitin Gadkari
said on Monday. Gadkari on Monday chaired a review meeting that was also attended by Union Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Jitendra Singh.
""The prestigious Chhatergala tunnel work, costing about Rs 4,000 crore, will be executed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the underpasses on the Kathua express corridor section, wherever demanded by the public, will be undertaken at the earliest,"" an official spokesperson said after the review meeting.
During the meeting, Singh thanked Gadkari for accepting most of the suggestions and proposals put across by him.
Singh said the proposal for the tunnel was initiated about six years ago and the detailed project report prepared by the
Border Roads Organisation
but the work could not be started due to a lack of funds.
Now, it has been decided that the NHAI will undertake construction of the new national highway from Lakhanpur to Basohli-Bani to Bhaderwah-Doda.

""Once this highway is complete, it will be a game changer as it will provide all-weather connectivity between Lakhanpur and Doda district via the tourist spots of Basohli and Bani, in addition to reducing travel time and giving a boost to businesses, employment and revenue generation,"" Singh said.
Referring to the under-construction Delhi-Katra express corridor, Singh recalled that it was approved after a lot of effort that began in 2015. There were initial delays because Punjab had also demanded a similar corridor for the highway between Delhi and Amritsar.
""Finally, after arriving at a compromise to have an express corridor between Delhi and Katra with stopovers in Amritsar and Kathua, the project was finalised,"" he said.
Singh said the corridor is in the last phase of construction and expressed satisfaction that the public demand for underpasses at places such as Hatli, Rajbagh, Chann Arorian, Chapper and Kootah had been accepted for the convenience of locals.

MEP Infrastructure Developers to seek settlement with lenders under IBC: Jayant Mhaiskar,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/mep-infrastructure-developers-to-seek-settlement-with-lenders-under-ibc-jayant-mhaiskar/articleshow/111042930.cms,17-06-2024,"Mumbai:
MEP Infrastructure Developers
(MIDL) will submit a
plan
under Section 12A of the
Insolvency
and
Bankruptcy
Code (
IBC
) and seek a
settlement
with
lenders
, its chairman told ET.
Jayant Mhaiskar said that before being admitted to bankruptcy, the company had planned to bring in a new investor. This plan will be pursued, he said. Section 12 A of IBC allows a promoter to settle dues with
creditors
and withdraw the insolvency application if 90% of the lenders agree to the plan. ""We had already proposed a settlement. Now that the IBC process has started, we will wait for more clarity and (see) how the company is valued and submit a plan accordingly,"" Mhasikar said.
Debt-laden MIDL was admitted to insolvency in late March after Bank of India (BoI) filed a petition. BoI and
IDBI Bank
are the primary creditors to the company. ET could not ascertain how much the company owes to the lenders, since creditors claims are yet to be made public.
Total banking sector exposure to the MIDL group is estimated to be close to ₹1,500 crore, including some with local co-operative banks, but most of it is in subsidiary companies or special purpose vehicles like MEP Infrastructure (MIPL), which was earlier operating the Bandra-Worli sea link.

MIDL has about 38 subsidiaries and joint ventures for different projects. Some contracts have been scrapped due to delay in project execution. ""It is unclear whether the court wants to consolidate all the group exposure into a single insolvency process or wants to do it separately for all SPVs as well. We will know as the case progresses,"" said a senior bank executive. Ravindra Kumar Goyal has already been appointed as resolution professional (IRP). He has already called for claims from creditors to determine the dues of the company. Two meetings of committee of creditors have taken place, the company informed the stock exchanges.
The admission of BoI's petition came just over a month after MIDL sought shareholder approval to bring a new investor and infuse ₹225 crore under the pre-packaged insolvency resolution process (PPIRP). The plan was that the company will issue
shares
to Nagpur-based Ashmi Road Carriers post shareholder approval. However, with the company's default topping ₹1 crore, PPIRP may not be feasible, according to regulations.

“The meeting focused on evaluating three significant infrastructure projects, one each from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (
MoRTH
), Ministry of
Railways
(MoR), and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (
MoHUA
),” the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement Saturday.
Held on June 12, the meeting was chaired by Rajeev Singh Thakur, additional secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (
DPIIT
).
A highway project in Jammu and Kashmir, which involves the construction and upgradation of a 51-Km section of NH-701 from Rafiabad to Chamkot, was evaluated.
With both greenfield (14.34 km) and brownfield (36.66 km) developments, the project is expected to cost Rs 1,405 crore.

“The upgraded route will significantly enhance connectivity for villages such as Kupwara, Chowkibal, and Tangdhar, improving logistical support for defence forces and boosting socio-economic conditions by providing better access to health, education, and business opportunities,” the ministry said.
The MoR project pertains to Gudur-Renigunta Third Rail Line in Andhra Pradesh for the construction of a third rail line between Gudur and Renigunta stations in Andhra Pradesh’s Tirupati district involves an 83.17 km line aimed at enhancing the capacity of the existing double line.
As per the statement, with an estimated cost of Rs 884 crore, this project will improve passenger and cargo movement efficiency, requiring 36.58 hectares of land. Infrastructure upgrades include new bridges, extended underpasses, and advanced signalling systems.
The third project was
Pune Metro Line Extension
in Maharashtra under the MoHUA
which aims to extend the operational metro corridor from Vanaz to Ramwadi in Pune. The project involves the extension of two lines on the eastern and western ends of the Vanaz–Ramwadi metro corridor. The extension on the western side is an elevated section of 1.12 km from Vanaz to Chandani Chowk, while the extension on the eastern side is an elevated section of 11.63 km from Ramwadi to Wagholi/Vitthalwadi. The total length of this elevated metro corridor will be 12.75 km and will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 3,757 crore.
The daily ridership for the line is anticipated to reach 3.59 lakh by 2027, and it is projected to grow to 9.93 lakh by 2057. This extension will connect central Pune with rapidly growing suburbs, reducing travel time and road congestion, and significantly enhancing the city’s public transport infrastructure.

FIDC urges RBI to relax draft guidelines on infrastructure provisioning,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/fidc-urges-rbi-to-relax-draft-guidelines-on-infrastructure-provisioning/articleshow/110895349.cms,11-06-2024,"Mumbai: The
Finance Industry Development Council
(
FIDC
), the representative body for
Non-Banking Financial Companies
(NBFCs), has requested the Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) to reconsider and clarify certain proposals in its recent draft circular on
infrastructure provisioning
. The draft, released last month, sets forth guidelines that
NBFCs
argue need flexibility to support the infrastructure sector.
Key concerns of the industry are the provisions on standard assets during the construction phase. The draft suggests a general provision of 5% of the funded outstanding should be maintained on all existing and stressed exposures on a portfolio basis. The FIDC has proposed RBI that the standard provision rate of 0.4% should continue for all projects, with enhanced provisioning reserved only for those projects requiring an extension in their Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations (DCCO).
The FIDC has sought clarity on whether the provisions apply solely to lenders financing projects under a common agreement between debtors and lenders. It also recommended that minimum financing limits should not be prescribed by the RBI but instead determined through commercial agreements between parties.
While RBI's draft stipulates that for projects with an aggregate exposure of up to Rs. 1500 crore, no individual lender's exposure should be less than 10% of the total exposure. For projects exceeding Rs. 1500 crore, the individual exposure floor should be 5% or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is higher, the FIDC wants regulator to relook these minimum limits and allow for commercial decisions to dictate financing terms.
On the proposed requirement of such events be reported to the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) by lenders, the FIDC has said that NBFCs currently lack access to CRILC, resulting in potential delays in information dissemination. It has requested the RBI to grant NBFCs access to CRILC, which has been a longstanding industry demand.

On the matter of DCCO extension, the FIDC requests that the timelines for exogenous and legal reasons be aligned with those for endogenous reasons, set at two years. The RBI's provision allows funding for cost overruns up to 10% of the original project cost if a standby credit facility was sanctioned initially. The FIDC has said that cost overruns can occur for various reasons beyond the control of borrowers and lenders. It has suggested that no cap should be placed on the maximum cost overrun that can be funded, leaving such decisions to commercial discretion.

Northeast
is set to get a crucial
connectivity link
to the
Bay of Bengal
with the opening of the long-awaited
Bangladesh-India friendship bridge
, known as
Maitri Setu
, by September.
The bridge was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina virtually in March 2021.
Modi and Hasina had a brief interaction at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Sunday night after the swearing-in ceremony of Modi 3.0. Hasina is expected to return for an official visit later in June or July.
The Bangladesh PM along with six other leaders from India’s immediate neighbourhood and Indian Ocean Region were invited for the inauguration ceremony.
Maitri Setu connects Bangladesh with
Tripura
giving northeastern states access to ports in Bay of Bengal. The bridge was built over the
Feni river
which flows between Bangladesh and Tripura. The 1.9-km-long bridge connects Ramgarh in Bangladesh with Sabroom in India. It was built by National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd at a project cost of Rs. 133 crore.
Live Events
Cargo movement
through the bridge is seen as strategically important as Bangladesh’s
Chittagong port
is just 80km from Tripura's Sabroom.
""The Maitri Setu has already been inaugurated. The land port is almost ready... The movement of passengers through the bridge will commence in September. It will take two or three months to introduce goods movement after passenger movement gets underway,"" Tripura industries and commerce department secretary Kiran Gitte said at a press conference in Agartala on Friday.
Meanwhile, India will also assist in the transit of electricity from Bhutan to Bangladesh. Hasina reiterated Bangladesh's eagerness to import hydroelectricity from Bhutan through India when the visiting Bhutanese prime minister Dasho Tshering Tobgay paid a courtesy call on her on Sunday in New Delhi.
""Import of hydroelectricity will require a tripartite agreement involving India, and we have already brought the matter to their (India's) attention,"" she told Tobgay.

investment
of Rs 150 crore or above, were hit by a
cost overrun
of more than Rs 5.55 lakh crore in April 2024, according to an official report. According to the
Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation
(
MoSPI
), which monitors
infrastructure projects
worth Rs 150 crore and above, out of 1,838 projects, 448 reported cost overruns and 792 projects were delayed.
The total
original cost
of implementation of the 1,838 projects was Rs 27,64,246.50 crore, and their anticipated
completion cost
is likely to be Rs 33,19,601.84 crore, which reflects an overall cost overrun of over Rs 5,55,355.34 (20.09 per cent of original cost), the ministry's latest report for April 2024 showed.
According to the report, the expenditure incurred on these projects till April 2024 is Rs 1,692,997.5 crore crore, which is 51 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects.
However, the number of
delayed projects
decreased to 514 if the delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion, it added.
Of the 792 delayed projects, 220 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 192 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 259 projects for 25-60 months, and 121 projects for more than 60 months.

Better planning can check delays in infra creation: Tata Projects,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/better-planning-can-check-delays-in-infra-creation-tata-projects/articleshow/110805589.cms,08-06-2024,"Delays
in
infrastructure projects
can be minimised by improving detailed project report (
DPR
) preparation, according to
Vinayak Pai
, managing director and chief executive officer at
Tata Projects
.
Speaking to ET, Pai said India needs better planned infrastructure for minimising delays during execution.
On reasons for various projects missing deadlines, he said the front end and concept design stage needs to get better.
""The level of effort and time given in the early-stage design or detailed project report (DPR) is much lower in India compared to global averages. This is why projects are not well defined, leading to delays,"" Pai said. Besides this, there is also a need to bring consistency in monitoring and executing contracts across ministries in public-private partnership (PPP) projects. ""Better
front-end planning
and consistent contracting mechanism across ministries will be very helpful in doing projects,"" he added.
Investments
in roads, railways,
metro projects
, ports and
airports
are expected to scale up significantly in the coming few months shortly after the new government takes charge.
Live Events
""The maximum investment of the government goes in roads and railways, so roads will continue to see a lot of investments and railways is coming up a lot stronger now,"" he said while adding that metro projects and airports will be the focus areas for his company.
Tata Projects is already executing the Pune Metro and the Noida International Airport (Jewar) which, according to Pai, are going as per schedule. Construction for a typical metro project can range up to ₹3,000 crore while new airports cost around ₹5,000 crore for full-scale international operations. Smaller airports can be built for half this cost.
He also assesses a strong demand for pumped hydro storage, green hydrogen, and manufacturing of batteries, semiconductors and electronics where Tata Projects has interest as an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor. ""We have chosen sectors where there is a mix of public-private partnerships and government funding,"" he said.
Metros were growing annually at around 20 kilometre (km) per year a decade ago.
""This has risen to almost 70-80 km per year and is trending towards 120 km per year across the country,"" Pai said, adding that there is a surge for developing airport projects as well.

NHAI's revised toll rates come to effect across highways,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/nhais-revised-toll-rates-come-to-effect-across-highways/articleshow/110666790.cms,03-06-2024,"New Delhi: The
revised
toll charges for
motorists
on
national highways
across the country have come to effect from Monday, an official said. The National Highways Authority of India (
NHAI

The
hike
is part of NHAI's annual exercise where the state-owned body calculates new rates factoring in several parameters, the senior NHAI official told PTI.
Every year, it is implemented from April 1 but this year the implementation was deferred due to general elections. The average hike this time was 5 per cent. The revised
user fee
has been implemented from today, the official said.
From Monday, motorists using national highways/expressways will have to shell out more money for their
road journeys

""The
fuel costs
were already high. The increased
toll rates
will make road journeys costlier for people,"" said Ankur Saxena, an advertising professional who frequently travels through Delhi-Lucknow route.

The toll fee is revised annually, taking into accounts the changes in the wholesale price index (CPI)-based
inflation
.
There are around 855 user fee plazas on the national highway network on which user fee is levied as per the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008.
Out of these, around 675 are public-funded fee plazas and 180 are operated by concessionaires.

have suggested that the
provision
that
lenders
must make against financing their

be fixed at
2%
instead of the

Currently, lenders need to set aside 0.4% as provision against loans provided to

The contractors have also proposed that the government consider 90% of
land availability
for financial closure as against the proposed 50%, and increase the
moratorium
for repayment to a year from the
RBI
suggested six months.
""By increasing the provisioning from 0.4% to 5%, project viability will be the biggest impediment as interest cost will increase which is turn will increase the cost of the project both for the investor as well as the government,"" the

According to the NHBF, this increased provisioning will slow down the pace of infrastructure development and hurt economic growth, besides impacting monetisation benefits.
The federation also said 2% provisioning could be implemented faster by 2025-26, as against 2026-27 if the government sticks with RBI's proposal to implement 5% in a phased manner.
""The phasing may not help the infrastructure industry as the lenders may factor in the highest provisioning rate in calculation of lending rates,"" it said.
Commenting on the extent of land availability for financial closure of infrastructure projects, the NHBF said land availability of not less than 90% should be considered sufficient. ""Land availability is the single largest risk factor which creates the delays or sometimes even leads to termination of projects,"" it said.
Calling for an increase in the moratorium period to a year, the NHBF argued that moratorium period is often availed of from lenders to sustain initial requirements of cash flow for stabilising operations.
""Restriction on this will create pressure on the cash flow of the company and may result in stress on the project, particularly for build-operate-transfer projects,"" it said.

As per the data, South Central Mumbai has the maximum 103 high-rise towers. Of these, at least 61 towers are completed and another 42 will be completed within the 2024-2030 period.
Mumbai's Central suburbs has 87 high-rises of over 40 floors. Of these 42 are completed and another 45 towers are under
construction
.
The city's Western suburbs have at least 80 high rises, with 50 towers complete and 30 towers scheduled for completion in the next six years.
Thane has at least 61 high-rises, of which just 2 towers are completed and the remaining 59 under development.
Navi Mumbai
follows with a total of 25 high-rise towers of 40+ floors - 10 are complete and 15 in various stages of construction.
The peripheral central and western suburbs have limited high-rise towers - 5 towers in total, all completed.
Micro-markets like Byculla, Worli, Lower Parel, Prabhadevi, Mahalakshmi, Marine Line, Mulund, Chembur, Kanjurmarg, Santacruz, Malad, Goregaon, and Thane City are the definitive skyscraper hotspots.
Commenting on the report, construction firm
BCD
MD Angad Bedi said, ""We are quite bullish on the Mumbai real estate market as it continues to attract occupiers and employees, thereby keeping the demand high across
CBD
, SBD and other sub-markets. This, complemented with the spate of redevelopment projects in city hot spots, is leading to the development of high rise projects across the city."".
This mushrooming of high-rise projects will accelerate Mumbai's journey to becoming a global metropolitan city on the lines of New York and Hong Kong, he added.

At the FICCI-Cold Chain and Logistics Summit on Wednesday, Ahirwar said that the gaps in
physical infrastructure
such as bad roads and inefficient ports are dampening the growth of the
logistics sector
, and these schemes are addressing those gaps.
“The push for
infrastructure development
, especially the physical infrastructure, under these schemes, will drive the growth of the logistics sector, including
temperature control warehousing
and make the cold chain sector more efficient,” he said.
Further, granting infrastructure status to warehousing facilities and cold chains has ensured the flow of credit to the logistics sector, including the cold chain infrastructure.
Ahirwar said that
ice batteries
have ensured uninterrupted temperature control even with interrupted power supply and in the most efficient way possible.

The government has also rolled out digital initiatives such as the
Unified Logistics Interference Platform
(ULIP) that allows tracking of each stage of the supply chain, from the place of production to the market.
“ULIP is the national data gateway for all logistics-related transactions and data from it can track the movement of goods from origin to destination,” Ahirwar said.

The ratio of cost overruns in central government projects hit a 12-month high of 20.09% in April, rising from 18.65% in the previous month,
government data
showed on Tuesday.
During the month, the anticipated cost of 1,838 projects involving
investment
of at least ₹150 crore swelled to ₹33.2 lakh crore or ₹5.6 lakh crore more than the original cost. The ratio of delayed projects also rose compared with the previous few months.
Experts say elections tend to cause disruptions to overall project activity.
ET Bureau

ministry of road transport and highways
will bat for status quo in

Reserve Bank of India

The ministry will oppose any change in the norms that would lead to a rise in

and urge the
central bank
to ensure that cost and pace of infrastructure creation is not impacted in the country, the official told ET.
""RBI, as a regulator, will have to create that balance to ensure

The central bank earlier this month proposed tighter norms, requiring lenders to allocate 5% of the project loan amount as general provisions during the construction phase, up from 0.4% provisions now.
The
National Highways Authority of India

People aware of the deliberations told ET that the
highway builders
see a significant rise in financial burden on agencies executing highway
infrastructure projects
following RBI's proposal of 5% provisions.
""This could potentially hinder the flow of credit to deserving sectors and individuals, ultimately impeding economic progress and the development of vital infrastructure projects,"" one of the sources told ET.
NHBF is of the view that the stringent timeline for compliance with the provisioning requirements and the provision for funding cost overruns arising from date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) extensions could pose challenges for agencies, particularly in infrastructure projects with varying timelines and complexities.
""It has suggested a phased approach to the provisioning requirements so as to provide more time for agencies to adjust to the new provisions and avoid sudden financial strains,"" the person quoted above said.
NHBF has also urged the central bank to re-evaluate the terms and conditions for funding cost overruns and has sought more clarity in the disclosure requirements to help highway builders streamline the reporting process without excessive administrative burdens.
""Ensuring a fair and sustainable approach for all stakeholders involved in highway infrastructure projects is crucial for the overall development and economic growth of the country,"" it had said.

Infrastructural projects helping improve India's relationship with Africa: Indian corporate executive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/infrastructural-projects-helping-improve-indias-relationship-with-africa-indian-corporate-executive/articleshow/110415971.cms,25-05-2024,"India's
infrastructure projects
are helping it strengthen ties with African nations, an Indian corporate executive has said, as he asked US
development finance institutions
to collaborate with the country to ensure the quickest execution of such projects to regain the trust of the nations lost out to
China
. S Kuppuswamy, a senior executive from the
Shapoorji Pallonji group
, was here to meet officials from both the private and government sectors to discuss the need for financing major infrastructural projects in Africa, which is increasingly looking towards countries like
India
and the
United States
.
These projects by India have ""phenomenally"" increased India's ties with African nations, he said.
""Our invitation is that development finance institutions from the US and elsewhere should collaborate with India... to see that more such (infrastructural) projects are executed in the quickest possible time in Africa to ensure that the nations lost out to China in the last two decades can be regained for mutual benefit,"" Kuppuswamy told
PTI
in an interview.
""Today, if you go to Ghana, any president there, whichever party he belongs to, takes pride in saying, when I go there, we are under your roof. I'm told that when President Barack Obama visited Ghana, he was shown the presentation, oh, an Indian company has constructed this, Kuppuswamy said.
""So, these are all things that enhance the prestige of Indian companies,"" he said.

Over the past few decades, the
Shapoorji Pallonji
group, which is more than 150 years old, has developed several major infrastructural projects in various parts of Africa including the
presidential palace
in Ghana and an international convention centre in Niger. In India, it recently completed the
Bharat Mandapam
.
""We hope that these projects, along with our attempts to get into mining-related infrastructure projects in Africa, will take Indian construction and infrastructure companies multiple notches up in Africa and in other parts of the developing world,"" he said.
Engineers from these African nations say that Indian companies involve them in the project, involving teaching and training them.
They say ""We are able to learn a lot about construction and all. This does not happen when we work for Chinese or other companies. This is something which is going to stand us in good stead,"" he said.
""Today, if you look at quality, African nations look more to India and to my group companies rather than to other countries' companies. Because we have been in a position to prove that we can do it at a lower cost and of greater
quality
than other nations,"" Kuppuswamy said.
Observing that
healthcare
is a sector where Africa lags behind a lot, he said that top-quality hospitals can be constructed with Indian construction technology, with healthcare equipment from the US or other countries.
""If there is financial assistance available from here, it can be run by qualified doctors from India or even elsewhere on a 5 or 10-year running contract with which we will be in a position to uplift the healthcare capabilities of these countries,"" Kuppuswamy said.
Responding to a question, Kuppuswamy said Indian companies are much better than the Chinese in quality. ""We treat people well. We impart learning to them. We take up corporate social responsibility activities on a large scale,"" he said.
""Wherever Shapoorji Pallonji group companies go, they give something to the society which is remembered by them much beyond the period of construction of these projects which means that we take pride in our ability to involve the local population in the construction and in uplifting the quality of life of those areas where you go for working,"" he said.

Ind-Ra expects stable operating performance for most infrastructural projects in FY25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/ind-ra-expects-stable-operating-performance-for-most-infrastructural-projects-in-fy25/articleshow/110366812.cms,23-05-2024,"India Ratings and Research
(
Ind-Ra
) expects stable
operating performance
for most
infrastructure projects
in the current financial year. The rating agency on Thursday maintained its
stable outlook
on the infrastructure sector, including the transport segment - which signifies low chances of rating changes for the sector in the near to medium term.
The rating agency assigned a positive outlook on the
airport segment
which means there are high chances of rating upgrades in the near to medium term.
Ind-Ra stated that the stable outlook on the infrastructure sector factors in the likelihood of a stable operating performance for most projects, long-term revenue visibility under concession agreements and power purchase pacts and expected improved cargo and traffic volumes.
On the
power sector
, the rating agency said it expects total capacity installed to reach about 476 GW in FY25 against 440 GW as of March 2024.
In a virtual press meet, Bharat Kumar Reddy, Associate Director at India Ratings and Research, said, ""On the energy front, we have seen peak demand growing by almost 13 per cent during the last fiscal. However, the deficit has reduced to 1.5 per cent compared to 4 per cent which we have seen in FY23 that is largely because of better coal supply.""

The overall peak demand was 243 GW in FY24 and the total capacity installed was about 440 GW as of March 2024.
""This is incremental of about 26 GW largely driven by solar of about 15 GW,"" Reddy said.
Maintaining its stable outlook on
toll roads
, the rating agency said it expects a moderation in toll collection growth in the range of 6-7 per cent in the current fiscal compared to double-digit growth seen in FY23 and last fiscal.
""Over 5-7 per cent is the
revenue growth
which is expected with toll revisions happening post elections,"" Rishabh Jain, Associate Director at Ind-Ra, said.
The rating agency has maintained a stable rating outlook on projects based on the hybrid annuity model for FY25. This is because of sustained high competition, a significant chunk of projects won by a new sponsor in either the under-construction or pre-appointment date stage, persisting land-related issues and lower awarding activity in FY24 and so far in FY25.
All these factors could cause developers to aggressively bid for projects leading to a build-up of stress in the sector.
Ports
, Jain said, continue to be stable and will be growing at around 6-7 per cent. The continued positive outlook for airports is based on steady
traffic growth
and improving non-aero revenues.
""Airport traffic has been very robust post-COVID. More importantly, non-aeronautical income has also been going up which means passengers are spending more at the airport leading to more non-aeronautical income at the airports which is leading them to a positive outlook.
""In addition to the spends and passenger movement, from a regulatory framework perspective, you will see there were a lot of delays which used to happen in terms of implementation of tariff orders in the past.
""Those delays have come down significantly...which probably makes us believe that from regulatory perspective we are getting into a far stable regime which is again a positive outlook for the airport,"" he explained.

ICRA
on Thursday said state-owned

's targeted

of
road assets
could fetch the
government
up to Rs 60,000 crore in the current

(NHAI) had released an indicative list of 33 road assets it plans to monetise in FY2025, through a mix of toll-operate-transfer (
TOT
) and sale to the NHAI's
Infrastructure Investment Trust
(InvIT).
These assets are spread across 12 states, cumulatively spanning nearly 2,750 km and with an annual toll collection of Rs 4,931 crore.
""ICRA estimates a
monetisation
potential of Rs 53,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore from the sale of 33 road assets through TOT/ InvIT mode,"" it said.
NHAI intends to club the 33 identified assets into large (more than Rs 6,000 crore), medium (about Rs 3,000 crore - Rs 4,000 crore) and smaller bundles (Rs 1,000-3,000 crore), for different types of investors.
Under the government's National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), road sector monetisation was expected to account for Rs 1.6 lakh crore, viz. 27 per cent of total monetisation during FY2022-FY2025.

Revamping of BOT model is tactical move to attract private capex: Ind-Ra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/revamping-of-bot-model-is-tactical-move-to-attract-private-capex-ind-ra/articleshow/110301784.cms,21-05-2024,"India Ratings and Research
(
Ind-Ra
) on Tuesday said the revamping of the built-operate-transfer (
BOT
) model is a tactical move to attract
private capex
, which is estimated to surpass Rs 1 trillion by 2030, as per the government. According to the rating agency, during the past seven years, the
government
has successfully rolled out about 400
Hybrid Annuity Model
(HAM) road projects in India, worth over Rs 4 trillion.
This approach has balanced risk appropriately between private and public partners, thereby boosting
public-private partnership
activity in the sector.
Also, the government's enhanced focus on monetisation via the
National Monetisation Pipeline
(NMP) has attracted
foreign investors
, including various sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, it added.
Ind-Ra asserted that developers need to be mindful of aggressive bidding, taking projects beyond the appetite of their balance sheet, and overestimating toll revenue for greenfield projects to protect them from volatilities in the longer run.
The
road sector
in India has been at the forefront of performance and innovation and has played a crucial role in shaping the country's
economic growth
trajectory, with a CAGR of about 14 per cent over the past decade, it said.

As per Ind-Ra,
BOT model
of road development will drive investments worth Rs 0.4 trillion-Rs 0.5 trillion in FY25.

made the infrastructure turnaround possible with him personally monitoring and reviewing projects worth 17.36 lakh crore, in contrast to the UPA government's term. , which was replete with examples of cost overruns, stalled projects and lack of timely approvals.

“Recognizing the potential of ISB, the panelists advocated for a wider adoption of the
financial instrument
for awarding of NHAI contracts while outlining various challenges and deliberating on possible measures that can be taken for faster adoption of the instrument,” NHAI said.
Insurance surety bonds is a financial instrument, where insurance companies act as ‘Surety’ and provide the financial guarantee that the contractor will fulfill its obligation as per the agreed terms.
NHAI is of the view that wider adoption of such instruments will help to strengthen
infrastructure development
in the country.

Chabahar brings to fore India's hidden infrastructural play,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/chabahar-brings-to-fore-indias-hidden-infrastructural-play/articleshow/110144827.cms,15-05-2024,"Construction of a gargantuan network of roads, highways, tunnels, bridges, airports, metros and high-speed trains is the showpiece of the
Narendra Modi
government. But one crucial piece of Modi's massive
infrastructure
upgrade remains invisible to voters. ""There is deeper transformation going on behind the scenes, too, in sectors with which most Indians have no direct contact but which affect their lives all the same. One of these is
ports
, which has seen huge improvement in capacity and efficiency,""
The Economist
wrote last week.
""
India
's politicians are often criticised for focusing on visible outcomes. But fixing infrastructure most voters do not see and simplifying rules most do not consider show that the state is capable of enacting deeper reform,"" wrote The Economist.
WIth India signing a deal with Iran to manage its
Chabahar Port
for the next 10 years, Modi's port play has come to light. This is the first time India will take over management of a port overseas. The port, which is seen as India's key
connectivity
link to Afghanistan, Central Asia and the larger
Eurasian
space, will help counterbalance Pakistan's Gwadar port as well as China's Belt and Road Initiative.
Chabahar has highlighted how India is expanding its
geopolitical
power by countering Chinese and Pakistani influence in the region and creating strategic footholds in other countries.
But
Chabahar
is also part of the ongoing port development in India which is a key component of Modi's aim to turn the country into a
manufacturing
powerhouse. The Chabahar port pact should be music to the ears of domestic traders and exporters, ET has written. This is because the port will also serve as a key node in the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a multimodal transportation network that aims to connect South Asia to Europe and Russia via Iran.

Chabahar: A step towards connectivity
The government says plans are underway to connect Chabahar to the INSTC, allowing Indian traders to reach Central Asia with greater ease and more cost-effectively.
Trade
experts explain that this will mean efficient access to Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, and the Baltic and Nordic countries — and not just the 11 countries in Central Asia. They also point out that the INSTC is being seen as an alternative to the Suez Canal trade route which remains vulnerable to regional conflicts.
Energy, pharmaceuticals, information technology, health, agriculture, textiles, and gems and jewellery can benefit greatly once India starts leveraging Chabahar port for the INSTC route, Nisha Taneja, a professor at Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), has told ET.
While the Chabahar port pact has hogged the headlines due to its geopolitical importance and the risk it carries of US sanctions against India, a silent transformation of India's port sector is on which doesn't figure prominently in popular discourse since ports are not visible to everyone like highways and trains are.
India's mega port push

Inaugurating three major infrastructure projects in Kochi in January,
Modi
said Indian ports have achieved double-digit annual growth in the past 10 years and beaten many developed nations in ship turnaround time. Earlier, ships had to wait long hours at ports and unloading took very long. ""Today, the situation has changed,"" he said.
The capacity at India's dozen major ports has doubled in the past 10 years from 745 mt to over 1,600 mt, The Economist has written. Traffic at these ports, which handle more than half of India's trade, jumped by 46% to 795 mt in the 10 years to 2023. Turnaround time, or the number of hours between the arrival and departure of a cargo ship, has plummeted from 127 hours in 2010-11 to 53 hours ten years later. The maritime sector accounts for 95% of India's trade by volume and 65% by value.
India's ambition to become a manufacturing powerhouse as well as the world's factory got a boost with a key project by the
Adani Group
getting the government nod recently. Adani's Vizhinjam Port in Kerala has received the shipping ministry's approval for operating as India's first transshipment port. It will be India's first full-fledged deepwater transshipment port. Located strategically between the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca, the port will put India on the map of global sea trade.
The proximity to the international shipping routes that account for 30% of global cargo traffic and a natural channel that goes up to 24 meters below the sea makes the port an ideal hub for some of the world’s biggest ships to call in, as per Bloomberg. Until now, the biggest container ships have been skipping India because its harbors weren’t deep enough to handle such vessels and docking at neighboring ports such as Colombo, Dubai, Singapore and Malaysia.

Ports play a crucial role in making a nation a powerhouse of manufacturing and exports. China is the prime example: the country has seven of the 10 busiest container ports in the world. Poor shipping connectivity has hindered India’s integration into the global value chain, the
Reserve Bank of India
said in a 2022 report. India’s container traffic was only 17 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit, is a measure of volume in units of twenty-foot long containers) in 2020 versus China’s 245 million TEUs, the
ports ministry
in February. That makes India’s container traffic less than 10% of China’s.
To boost its cargo handling capacity and host large vessels, India is constructing another port, the Vadhavan port in Dahanu, 150 km north of Mumbai.
India's maritime vision
Ports at Vizhinjam and Vadhavan are part of the government's Maritime India Vision 2030 that seeks to develop world-class mega ports, transshipment hubs and modernize infrastructure.
As part of the Amrit Kaal Vision 2047, India has six mega ports on the anvil as part of its maritime expansion plans. According to official estimates, around Rs 15-20 lakh crore of this investment will be needed in raising the country's port handling capacity by 2047. This investment will come handy for increasing port handling capacity by four times, creating maritime clusters along Indian ports, and developing three islands as hubs for bunkering, ship repair, and Vessel Spares and Stores, among others.

Reasons for time overrun, as reported by various project implementing agencies, include delay in
land acquisition
, obtaining forest and
environment clearances
, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delays in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems are among other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in the implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

is evaluating
Reserve Bank of India
draft rules calling for higher provisioning in infrastructure projects, while

are likely to oppose them on multiple forums. Officials cited concerns that they could lead to a rise in
interest rates
and derail
capital expenditure
momentum.
After the evaluation exercise, the draft rules will be discussed with the banking regulator during consultations, said people with knowledge of the matter.
The unveiling of the proposals led to a slide a day earlier, in the stocks of state-owned banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and infrastructure firms, over investor worries that the norms could take a toll on financials, if implemented.
""These are draft guidelines, and the consultation process is on. All stakeholders will try to find a common ground to manage risks while supporting infrastructure financing,"" said a finance ministry official, adding that if banks and other ministries flag any concerns, these will be shared with
RBI
. The regulator has sought comments on its proposed guidelines by June 15.

Banks are also set to lobby with the central
bank
against the sharp increase in provisions, arguing that it may stall the momentum that's made India the fastest-growing major economy amid a climate of global uncertainty. The lenders will also likely make their views against the proposals known through the
Indian Banks' Association
(IBA), senior bankers said. They will argue that applying higher
provisions
for ongoing projects could impact their viability, with costs going up, possibly leading to delays and stressed loans.
State-owned power sector NBFCs such as
REC
and
Power Finance Corp
will communicate their views directly to the regulator, said the officials cited above, adding that the Department of Financial Services will also flag any concerns that state-owned lenders highlight.

Indian lenders to appeal RBI's tough project finance proposal, sources say
The Fallout
""This is a very steep increase and comes when there are no real risks that one can see in
project finance
,"" said a senior private sector bank executive. ""No one has a clue on what led RBI to increase the provisions so sharply, because when you look at banking results, or even fresh slippages, they are lower than what is being recovered.""
""Banks will have to give feedback based on what they see,"" the executive said. ""But since RBI has started at 5%, it is very difficult to see what the logic is, or what could be a fair level, for provisions. It could force the handful of banks which do infrastructure lending to rethink lending to this sector.""
Under the proposed guidelines issued on May 3, lenders will be required to set aside up to 5% of outstanding exposure as provisions during the construction phase of projects, compared with the current 0.4%. This will be reduced to 2.5% when the project is operational. It will drop to 1% after the project generates adequate cash flow to repay obligations and long-term debt declines by at least 20% from the time of commencing commercial operations. The provisions are expected to be implemented in phases - 2% in FY25, 3.5% in FY26 and 5% by FY27.
Stocks of key infrastructure NBFCs such as Power Finance Corp, REC and
Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency
fell for the second day in a row on Tuesday. Public sector stocks had seen a decline of Rs 1.83 lakh crore in
stakeholder value
the previous day.
Bankers said the new norms are for all infrastructure projects, so costs will go across the board.
""The higher costs could make some of these projects unviable and increase stress in the banking system when none exists today. Banks and IBA will, of course, share feedback and suggestions on these new norms,"" said a senior public sector bank executive.
Assessments Ongoing
An executive at IIFCL said the state-run infrastructure financing firm is studying the draft guidelines and will send inputs accordingly. ""It's too early to comment on the impact,"" he said.
The road ministry is evaluating the implications, an official said. The initial observation was that it may result in a slight increase in interest rates for infrastructure projects and impact the cash flow for private players as well as the government, the person said. ""Though risk weightage will go up, we don't see any significant impact on the final cost,"" he added.
PFC and REC may have a limited impact on profit and loss (P&L) accounts, but the stringent provisioning requirements may impact the capital adequacy ratio, an executive with one of the companies said.
According to a note by IIFL Securities, the proposed additional provisions in the draft guidelines will not be routed through P&L but instead apportioned to the impairment reserve (which cannot be included in the capital ratio and net non-performing assets calculations). ""Therefore, NBFCs shall not have a return-on-equity impact, but infra-focused NBFCs, such as REC, PFC and IREDA can see a potential hit of 200-300 bps (basis points) to their capital ratio,"" it said in its research note.
Some experts said the proposed guidelines will have no impact on the pace of infrastructure creation. ""With this, RBI has only tried to reset areas of doubt. I don't see any impact on interest rates or the pace of the construction,"" said Vinayak Chatterjee, founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.
Additional Burden
However, Karthik Srinivasan, head of
financial sector
ratings at Icra, said that besides making projects more expensive, bank profitability may take a hit. ""Banks will now be more mindful of increased exposure to project finance,"" he said. ""From RBI's perspective, this move is in line with the recent tightening of regulations. The regulator is probably trying to ensure banks and NBFCs are insulated from any risk building up in project finance because it was this sector that a large part of NPAs came from in the last cycle.""
In a report on Tuesday, Macquarie analyst Suresh Ganapathy said the new provisions - along with additional disclosures that financial sector companies need to furnish on a quarterly basis - make the guidelines onerous in nature.
""It usually takes 6-7 years to achieve that outcome and hence, in the interim, banks will have to carry between 2.5-5% of the loan amount as provisioning charge, thereby significantly affecting the economics for the bank as well as for the project if banks decide to fully pass on the increased provisioning,"" Ganapathy said.
CareEdge Ratings said in a report that the norms could lead to funding challenges. ""A mandatory tail period accounting for 15% of a project's economic life will restrict the ability of infrastructure projects to secure additional top-up loans,"" it said. ""This will necessitate an 8-10% increase in equity requirements for hybrid annuity model-based road projects to align the loan tenure with 85% of the economic life for concessions lasting 15 years.""

“It has also been observed that
project agencies
are not reporting
revised cost estimates
and
commissioning schedules
for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures may be underreported,” the release stated.
A sectoral division shows that Railways and water resources had the highest cost overruns, with the anticipated costs of all projects monitored by the ministry exceeding the original cost by 54% and 197%, respectively.
Of the 249 projects monitored by the portal under Railways, over half or 149, were facing cost overruns, while the ratio was 9 out of 41 for water resources. Nearly a fifth of projects in roads, which accounts for the highest number of undergoing projects, were facing cost overruns.
Regarding
time overruns
, 109 of 249 railway projects faced time overruns, whereas nearly 40% of road projects were delayed.

The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (
DPIIT
) plans to engage the National Council of Applied Economic Research (
NCAER
) to conduct a primary survey to assess cargo movement patterns and the cost of logistics for each component involved, they said.
Last year, the think tank had estimated India's logistics costs in 2021-22 at 7.8-8.9% of the GDP, based on secondary data. ""We will do another exercise along with the NCAER because the previous one was based on secondary data. This time, it will combine feedback and original surveys,"" said an official, who did not wish to be identified.
A memorandum of understanding is being worked out between the department and the council for this, the official said. Capturing origin-destination pair-wise, commodity-wise, geography-wise data is critical for accurate estimations. The department is also working on improving India's ranking in the
World Bank Logistics Performance Index
from 38 in 2023 to below 25.
Live Events
The government aims to come up with a methodology to address the twin objectives of timely and robust measurements of logistic costs, and ways to reduce such costs by removing bottlenecks.
The survey will help shed light on logistics cost per tonne per kilometre on each of the routes under consideration and differential in logistics costs across routes, modes, products, types of cargo and service operations.
Origin-destination route surveys of selected products to obtain information on the relevant time and cost of transportation and storage, administrative bottlenecks at customs, warehouses and freight and forwarding agents, and ports are being deliberated, according to people in the know.

National Highways construction to decline by 7-10% to 31 km/day in FY25: CareEdge Ratings,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/national-highways-construction-to-decline-by-7-10-to-31-km/day-in-fy25-careedge-ratings/articleshow/109731254.cms,30-04-2024,"The pace of
National Highways
construction in India is estimated to
slow down
by 7-10 per cent to around 31 km/day in the current fiscal due to heightened execution challenges,
CareEdge Ratings
said on Tuesday. The pace of National Highways construction in India during FY24 registered a healthy uptick of 20 per cent to 34 km/day.
""CareEdge Ratings expects National Highways Construction to slow down from 12,350 km in FY24 to 11,100-11,500 km in FY25,"" it said.
However, according to the rating agency, despite the uptick, the pace of construction fared lower than 37 km per day reported in FY21 due to execution woes and an increasingly competitive landscape.
It said BOT (build, operate and transfer)-HAM remained the preferred mode of award, constituting around 55 per cent of the total projects awarded during FY21-24.
Under the HAM model, the government provides 40 per cent of the project cost to the developer to start work, while the remaining investment are made by the contractor.

Road construction in India to witness 7-10% slowdown in FY25 due to challenges in execution: CareEdge Ratings,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/road-construction-in-india-to-witness-7-10-slowdown-in-fy25-due-to-challenges-in-execution-careedge-ratings/articleshow/109721937.cms,30-04-2024,"Pace of
road construction
in
India
is expected to witness a 7-10% decline in 2024-25 with the daily construction estimated at 31 km per day as against 34 km per day in 2023-24 due to heightened challenges in execution, the
CareEdge Ratings
said on Tuesday.
This will result in the national highways construction to slow down to 11,100 km to 11,500 km in this financial year as against 12,350 km in FY '24, it said.
“Increasing project complexities, rising participation of moderate creditworthy sponsors and significant delay in the receipt of appointed date post award of the project are expected to pull down the execution pace by 7-10% during
FY25
to around 31 km per day,” it added.
According to CareEdge Ratings, with the announcement of greenfield expressways and highways, the challenges towards land acquisition have aggravated, thereby elongating the receipt of the appointed date.
“Also, the permissible execution span for projects is uniform at two years, irrespective of the project scope whether brownfield or greenfield expressway, which has further contributed to the project delays,” it said.

“All the above factors have increased the project completion cycle from earlier 2.75-3.25 years to around 3.50-4 years presently, resulting in a higher turnaround time for project execution and a subdued execution pace in the sector,” it added.
CareEdge Ratings further said that the expected shift in awarding preference from engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) to hybrid annuity model (HAM) and toll projects in the medium term will lead to 25-30% reduction in the share of EPC projects going forward. “This shall also help in reducing the funding requirement for NHAI while focusing on the quality of construction,” it added.
As per the rating agency, under the revised toll concessions also, the funding requirement for NHAI shall reduce to 20%-32.5% of project cost as against 100% for EPC projects. “At the same time, peak debt requirement is likely to be lower by 10% vi-a-vis old BOT-toll concessions due to equity support from NHAI,” he added.
According to the CareEdge Ratings, build-operate-transfer (BOT) and hybrid annuity model (HAM) remained the preferred mode of award constituting around 55% of the total projects awarded in the road sector during FY21-FY24.
“We have observed significant delays in the execution of such HAM projects. Of the overall sample of HAM projects awarded after March 2020 amounting to Rs.1.50 lakh crore, approximately one-third of the projects with an aggregate bid project cost (BPC) value of Rs 50,000 crore are facing delays ranging from four-six months beyond the grace period of three months,” it said.
“Notably, another significant portion of NH-HAM projects with an aggregate BPC value of Rs 40,000 crore as of April 1, 2024 are still awaiting issuance of appointed date for more than a year as compared to Rs14,500 crore as of June 30, 2023,” it added.
“As project complexities rise and timelines elongate, it is imperative to swiftly address bottlenecks thus ensuring seamless infrastructure development,” Maulesh Desai, director, CareEdge Ratings said.

India has one of the largest construction industries in the world,with an estimated size of over $700 billion. And yet, the industry operates in a fragmented fashion, leading to delays, cost overrun, compliance-related delays, and substandard quality of work.

The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
While the cost overruns due to general price escalation could not be avoided, the cost escalation on account of delay could be minimized, it stated.

growing at a fast pace, REITs and InvITs are emerging as alternative investment instruments, especially for high net-worth individuals.
""India has been a late adopter of

RBI
's April Bulletin.
March witnessed the listing of an InvIT, which raised Rs 2,500 crore through a public issue, attracting substantial interest from foreign investors.
The article noted that market regulator
SEBI
has progressively reduced the minimum investment size and trading lot, enabling greater retail participation in these hybrid instruments.
To further develop this space, the market regulator notified
regulations
for small and medium REITs on March 8, 2024.

""This is expected to facilitate pooled investment in a wider range of real estate assets as a regulated financial product, thereby facilitating further
growth
of REITs in India,"" said the article authored by a team led by RBI deputy governor Michael Debabrata Patra.
Rajeshwar Burla, Senior Vice President and Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said the RBI allowed banks to lend to InvITs, which along with security enforcement for lenders under the SARFAESI Act, are some promising steps taken in recent times.
""Thanks to a conducive regulatory framework, and a strong pipeline of good operational assets, the industry was able to mobilise over Rs 1.3 lakh crore since FY2020. InvITs and REITs helped unwind capital blocked in already operational infrastructure assets - which can be re-invested into under-construction projects and support infrastructure development in India,"" said Burla.
Indian REITs Association said SEBI's progressive regulations, particularly the reduction in lot size to bringing it on par with other listed companies to buy even single units has transformed REITs into an attractive asset class for retail investors.
""This has not only enhanced accessibility but also ensured liquidity, allowing reach to a broader investor base... We are also actively collaborating with SEBI on multiple fronts, including global benchmarking of best REIT practices, standardising financial reporting and disclosures, and addressing other regulatory requirements, amongst others,"" the Association said in a statement.
A REIT is made up of a portfolio of commercial real estate assets, the majority of which are already leased out, and InvITs consist of a portfolio of infrastructure assets like highways.
Co-Founder and CEO of YOURS, a platform for fractional ownership of luxury second homes, Sudeep Chandran said it is true that India was a bit late in allowing REITs, yet in the last couple of years it has gathered momentum particularly from HNIs.
""The continuous rise in monthly inflows reflects this momentum. The recent SEBI guidelines on SM REITs provides another option to savvy investors. We anticipate significant investor interest in SM REITs, driving substantial growth in combined REIT and SM REIT investments over the next 3-5 years,"" Chandran said.
Commenting on these investment instruments, Ritesh Kumar Shyam, Partner, M&A Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India, said REITs and InvITs have picked up quite some traction in the domestic investment market given that these assets offer fixed income with a secured asset base and the returns are generally better than other secured asset investments.
""The recent small-medium ReITS regulation by SEBI is another boost to this sector...What is needed for the SM ReITS to be successful is a tax neutral regime that allows fractional-ownership platforms to switch to SM ReIT structure including some stamp duty exemptions,"" Kumar added.
Overall, InvITs and REITs have seen tremendous growth. While the rules were put in place in 2014, the first investment trust was registered with Sebi in 2016-17. At present, there are 24 registered InvITs and 5 REITs.
Amit Chopra- president NAR India, was of the opinion that India's REIT and InvIT market is expected to witness further growth in the years to come.
""The government's initiatives to promote infrastructure development and ease the doing business environment are expected to continue to drive the investment landscape. As market participants get to know these investment vehicles better and regulatory frameworks change, we can expect to see an increase in REIT activity and participation,"" Chopra said, and added the continued growth of these instruments is expected to significantly contribute to the development and growth of the infrastructure and real estate sectors in India.
CEO and Founder of FOIP (Fractional Ownership Investment Platform) Aankush Ahuja said MSME REITs will offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and stable cash flow. Including real estate in a portfolio provides diversification and dividend-based income.
""REITs and InvITs are promising formats which provide investors with an avenue to participate in the real estate and infrastructure space without assuming the elevated levels of risk and without the need for substantial capital typically associated with direct investments in these projects,"" Ahuja said.
The markets regulator has been consistently working on amendments to REITs and InvITs to upscale the governance standards while increasing transparency through provisions like Unitholder Nominated Directors, the cap on leverage, minimum rating requirements, higher disclosure measures than companies, various options to raise equity, such as rights, institutional placement, in addition to IPO.
Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has improved the ease of investment by reducing lot size to one or updating the pricing requirements for institutional placements by listed trusts.

Centre studying innovative ways to boost infrastructure funding,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/centre-studying-innovative-ways-to-boost-infrastructure-funding/articleshow/109510192.cms,22-04-2024,"The government is exploring policy mechanisms to capture the increase in land value resulting from
road projects
, including auctioning exits at
greenfield expressways
and 'betterment' levy, as it looks to ramp up funding for infrastructure creation, a senior official told ET.
In this regard, the roads ministry is studying global best practices on innovative ways of
infrastructure financing
, the official said, adding that a decision on which mechanism will be used will be taken after the new government takes charge.
""The thinking is part of the long-term vision of the ministry...The idea is to recover and reinvest the increase in land value along our upcoming expressways, which can be used for financing development of future infrastructure creation,"" the official said. Betterment levy is a one-time charge on property owners adjacent to expressways who have benefited from government action to develop infrastructure. The charge depends on the proximity to the expressway.
Land value capture
is a tool used by governments globally to generate revenue for public services. For instance, Columbia and Brazil are experimenting with betterment levy, the US and Canada are trying impact fee in some projects, while Latin America is looking at additional development rights. The governments of Japan and Germany are exploring land pooling or land readjustment.

According to Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, senior director & global head, consulting, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics, 'land value capture' is an established way of capturing the increase in the market rate of land on account of government spending on public infrastructure, and is usually accentuated for linear infrastructure projects like roads and metro rail networks.
""This is certainly doable in India. However, the challenge would be in terms of demarcating the zone as the value increase of land is higher nearer to the area of development and decreases as you move away, hence making the owners pay up in an uniform manner becomes a challenge,"" Padmanabhan said. Vinayak Chatterjee, founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation, said, ""The various land value capture mechanisms are reasonably simple and can be easily implemented in India."" TheCentre is of the view that since the value of land near highway projects appreciates after the roads are ready, benefiting real estate companies developing those areas, it should look at ways of tapping it for bolstering public infrastructure projects. India requires more than ₹20 lakh crore by 2030 to upgrade its road infrastructure. Such a move, coupled with
asset monetisation
, can help reduce dependence on budget support for road projects, which is pegged at ₹2,78,000 crore for FY25.
The Centre has sanctioned 27 greenfield expressway projects totalling 10,000 km in length across the country at a cost of ₹4.5 lakh crore. These are expected to be ready by 2030. At present, the ministry, through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), is pursuing asset monetisation to raise funds for its projects through toll-operate-transfer (TOT) and an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) modes.

ANZ Bank in talks with Australia Pensions on India investments,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/anz-bank-in-talks-with-australia-pensions-on-india-investments/articleshow/109422851.cms,19-04-2024,"ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. is in discussions with
Australian pension funds
about investing in India’s
infrastructure assets
and its
debt market
, according to a senior bank official.
“We are currently in talks with a few Australian pension funds to bring them to India,” Mark Whelan, group executive of institutional at the bank, said in an interview in Mumbai. “We are looking at establishing a holistic business relationship with them.”
ANZ will help pension funds by identifying suitable assets as well as connect them to potential investment opportunities as an intermediary, Whelan said, without naming the funds.
India’s infrastructure sector is in need of substantial funding, while Australian funds are looking for investment opportunities globally due to limited domestic options. India’s ruling party has committed to prioritize infrastructure in its campaign manifesto as Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
seeks a third term in elections that kicked off Friday.
The South Asian nation’s infrastructure spending is expected to double, reaching nearly $143 lakh crore ($1.7 trillion) in the next seven fiscal years through 2030, according to a note from Crisil Ratings. That presents opportunities for Australia’s A$3.7 trillion ($2.4 trillion) pensions industry, the world’s fourth largest. Its assets are projected to more than triple to A$13.6 trillion by 2048, as per a Mercer report.
Live Events
Additionally, Indian
government bonds
are becoming an attractive investment avenue, as they will be included in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s flagship emerging markets bond index from June.
“Investing in government bonds via foreign portfolio route is an attractive bet for Australian pension funds as Indian sovereign securities are offering 7%-7.50%,” Whelan said. It provides a chance for large Australian pension funds to deploy their capital, he added.
ANZ has doubled its capital base in India to A$600 million over the past two years, he said.
ANZ Group Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliott last month told Bloomberg he aims to grow the firm’s presence in India as customer needs shift with changing global trade patterns. The strategy also includes reducing positions it holds in banks in Malaysia, China and Indonesia.

Overhaul of rural roads scheme likely after polls; proposal part of govt's Viksit Bharat by 2047 plan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/overhaul-of-rural-roads-scheme-likely-after-polls-proposal-part-of-govt-viksit-bharat-by-2047-plan/articleshow/109382595.cms,18-04-2024,"The government is planning to overhaul its flagship rural roads scheme after the general election to further bolster connectivity in remote areas, spur economic growth and alleviate poverty, people close to the development told ET. This will form part of the government’s ambition to turn
India
into a developed country by 2047.
Revamping the
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
(PMGSY) will focus on substantially expanding and upgrading the existing network of rural roads and linking them with nearby hubs and markets to bolster “productive capacity of the economy and ensure ease of living”, said the people cited above.
“Along with rural housing, rural roads will assume renewed focus in the next term (of the Modi government). The priority will not just be to have roads in every nook and corner of rural India but to go beyond that and link economic, educational, health, social or agriculture centres,” one of the persons said. “These steps are aimed at transforming rural India like never before,” he added.
ET Bureau
Already, the interim
Budget
has announced constructing 20 million houses under the
Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana
(
Gramin
) over five years. PMGSY was introduced by the
Vajpayee
government in December 2000, with experts calling it a decisive step that has altered the rural economic and social landscape.

Since its launch, 759,689 km of roads have been built under the scheme. Already three versions of the scheme—PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II and PMGSY-III—have been rolled out periodically by widening its scope and revamping the implementation method. The construction of roads identified has been completed above 90% in 18 states, with
Goa
touching 100%. But in certain hilly and north-eastern states, and Union territories, the completion is in the range of 58% to 89%.
A study on the impact of the PMGSY, conducted by the World Bank in 2018, revealed that farm produce transported to markets for sale using roads built under the scheme increased 8% than before. The rate of primary employment in the non-farm sector rose about 13% because of the improved road network and the share of people with primary employment outside their habitation inched up 8%. Even the share of babies delivered at home dropped by 30% in connected habitations, leading to an improved child mortality rate in rural areas, according to the study.

NIIF eyes $1 billion for second Private Markets Fund,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/niif-eyes-1-billion-for-second-private-markets-fund/articleshow/109362296.cms,17-04-2024,"India
's quasi-sovereign National
Investment
and Infrastructure Fund Ltd (
NIIF
) is set to raise about $1 billion for its second
Private Markets Fund
(
PMF
), said people aware of the development. PMF-II will back India-focused private equity and venture capital funds.
NIIF, which launched the fundraising process early this year, is expected to make a first closure of about $550 million in a few months. The government of India, which owns about 49% of NIIF, will be the largest contributor to PMF-II.
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which backed the first PMF, is likely to invest about $125 million in the second one.
NIIF raised the $600 million PMF-I in 2019 and deployed the money in eight funds in India. PMF-I was backed by AIIB, Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB) and Asian Development Bank (ADB), besides the government of India (GoI).
PMF-II will invest in funds that are being newly raised to the extent of 15-20%, said the people cited above. NIIF is in discussions with sovereign wealth funds, insurance funds and pension funds from North America, Asia, Australia and West Asia to tap them as possible
investors
in PMF-II, said the people cited.
Live Events
NIIF didn't respond to queries.
PMF-I invested in Renuka Ramnath-run Multiples PE ($125 million), Lighthouse India ($50 million), Eversource Capital ($170 million), Somerset Healthcare ($18 million), Arpwood Partners ($80 million).
It also invested in Yournest Capital Advisors ($15 million), HDFC Capital Advisors ($100 million) and Amicus Capital Partners ($25 million).
According to the NIIF website, 37% of PMF-I was deployed in nine portfolio companies in the areas of renewable energy, e-mobility, waste and water management, and climate financing. The bulk of the rest went to 34 portfolio companies in segments such as hospitals, med-tech distribution, affordable housing, financial services, technology and startups.
The NIIF PMF provides global institutional investors a platform for accessing India's private assets market through a mix of third-party fund managers and co-investment opportunities, according to the website. NIIF has returned about $100 million from PMF-I to investors till date.
NIIF had hired Anand Unnikrishnan in 2018 as managing partner to head its PMF (formerly fund of funds) business. Anand had been a senior member of the Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) team in India for about 10 years.
NIIF manages over $4.9 billion of equity capital commitments across its four funds - Master Fund, PMF, Strategic Opportunities Fund and India-Japan Fund.
2023 recorded an 8% decline in fundraising to $15.9 billion by 102 funds, compared with $17.4 billion by 99 funds in 2022, against $7.7 billion by 73 funds in 2021, according to an EY report.
Homegrown fund Kedaara Capital is closing its Fund IV at $1.7 billion while ChrysCapital is raising its 10th fund with a corpus of $2 billion. Recently, Multiples PE closed its Fund IV at $800 million with a provision to add another $500 million as a greenshoe option.
PE and VC deals declined to $49 billion in 2023 from $56 billion in 2022 and $76 billion in 2021. The number of deals fell to 853 from 1,273 in 2022, according to the EY India report. The first half attracted PE and VC investments of $27.5 billion, while the second half saw investments of $22.2 billion, as firms exercised increased caution amid rising inflationary pressures, geopolitical conflicts, and impending general elections, all of which contributed to a slowdown in deal activity, it said.

"Road execution to grow 5-8 per cent in FY25 to 12,500-13,000 km: Icra",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/road-execution-to-grow-5-8-per-cent-in-fy25-to-12500-13000-km-icra/articleshow/109341732.cms,16-04-2024,"Road execution
in India is likely to grow 5-8 per cent to 12,500-13,000 km in the current fiscal, after recording a robust expansion of 20 per cent in 2023-24, rating agency
Icra
said on Tuesday. It added that the pace of execution in this fiscal will be supported by a healthy pipeline of projects, increased capital outlay by the government and focus on completion of projects by
Ministry of Road Transport
and Highways (MoRTH).
Icra noted that road execution was impacted in the first half of FY24 on account of a prolonged monsoon in certain geographies, which affected productive days.
According to Icra, the ministry's project award pipeline is healthy, at above 45,000 km as of March 2024.
This is despite the awarding being significantly impacted in FY24 amid delay in approval from the Cabinet for the revised cost estimates of
Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase
1 (BMP), it added.
Consequently, the overall awards declined by 31 per cent to 8,551 km in FY24 from 12,375 km in FY23.
Live Events
Icra pointed out that a similar trend was seen in FY19 before the last general elections, when the project awarding had declined by over 67 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
The rating agency said engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) mode continues to be the mainstay of this process, accounting for 70-75 per cent of the awards in FY24, followed by
Build, Operate, Transfer
(BOT)- Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM), accounting for 25-30 per cent share.
""There were no awards under
BOT-Toll
in FY2024,"" Icra said, adding that in March 2024, the ministry amended the BOT-Toll model concession agreement to improve its attractiveness.

Funds for rural housing scheme okayed till September,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/funds-for-rural-housing-scheme-okayed-till-september/articleshow/109323376.cms,16-04-2024,"The
finance
ministry has approved the release of funds for six more months through September 2024 under the government's flagship housing scheme, a move that will enable completion of about 3.5 million rural houses, a senior official told ET.
The government had set a target of building 29.5 million houses under the
Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin
(
PMAY-G
) by March 2024 to realise its ""housing for all"" goal.
Approval was granted to construct nearly all these. About 26 million houses have already been built since November 2016 when the scheme was rolled out revamping the erstwhile Indira Awas Yojana.
ET Bureau
In a communication to the rural development ministry this month, the finance ministry has made it clear the funds will have to be utilised only for meeting committed liabilities under the PMAY-G as of March 31, said the official.

""They (the rural development ministry) have been told that there should be no fresh sanctions under the scheme beyond March 31 or beyond the targeted 29.5 million houses for now,"" the official said.
The rural development ministry had last month sought the finance ministry's approval for releasing funds beyond March 2024 against committed PMAY-G liabilities, the official added.
'Not bypassing EC norms'
Although the latest move comes in the build-up to the general election, it doesn't violate the Election Commission's model code of conduct, as the
fund
release is to merely honour past commitments, said another official.
Under the scheme, the Centre bears 60% of the construction cost in most states, which goes up to 90% in
North East
and 100% for UTs, while states pitch in with the rest.
Delay in construction
About 1.1 million of the targeted 4.57 million houses in
West Bengal
are yet to be completed, as the Centre's payment has been withheld for now due to alleged irregularities in the implementation of the scheme by the state government.
Similarly, in
Andhra Pradesh
, only 29% of the houses have been completed, thanks to allegations of non-adherence of rules. However, the pace of construction in the state has now gathered steam.

business
optimism, could nurture a sustained revival in the investment cycle, according to a
Reserve Bank
report. According to the
RBI
's
Monetary Policy
Report- April 2024, domestic economic activity, backed by strong fundamentals, remained robust in the first half of 2023-24, weathering challenges from muted global
demand
.
The report further said that while the fixed investment and the lower drag from net external demand propelled real GDP growth, private consumption received support from steady urban demand.
On the supply side, it added, manufacturing activity strengthened further, benefiting from lower input costs and the improvement in global supply chains.
Construction activity remained firm on the back of buoyant housing demand and the government's thrust on infrastructure.
""Going ahead, private consumption will get support from improved prospects for rural demand and rising consumer confidence.

""The government's continued emphasis on infrastructure creation, coupled with an uptick in private corporate investment and buoyant business optimism, could nurture a sustained revival in the investment cycle, which augurs well for boosting productivity and growth in the economy,"" the RBI report said.
It further said that the impact of a lower fiscal impulse on growth could be offset by higher growth-inducing capital expenditure.
The economy's medium and long-term growth potential ""is rising, propelled by structural drivers like improving physical infrastructure; development of world class digital and payments technology; ease of doing business; enhanced labour force participation; and improved quality of fiscal spending,"" the report said.
The government has announced an 11 per cent growth in capital expenditure (capex) to Rs 11.11 lakh crore for the current financial year as private investment picks up.
The government hiked capex by 37.5 per cent to Rs 10 lakh crore in 2023-24.
As per a RBI survey, consumer confidence one year ahead reached a new high.
The survey reflected that the prospects of investment activity remain bright owing to an upturn in the private capex cycle becoming steadily broad-based; persisting and robust government capital expenditure; healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates; rising capacity utilisation; and strengthening business optimism.

: The
Ministry of Road Transport
and Highways, in the first 100 of the formation of the next government, could unveil a mega plan for building 50,000 km of new, access-controlled, expressways by 2037 to help reduce logistic costs.
The programme is expected to replace the Bharatmala scheme and will sync all future road projects with the government’s Vision 2047 for the sector. Besides, the government is considering satellite- or GPS-based tolling on select stretches by replacing FASTags to do away with wait time at toll plazas, and rolling out a cashless treatment facility for all road accident victims.
The first 100 days of the new government will see the ministry laying down short-, medium- and long-term targets across the identified areas as part of the comprehensive development of India’s
road transport
sector, a senior government official told ET.
“The road ministry has aligned its future projects to Vision 2047 and, going forward, a majority of road projects will be bid out on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) mode with greater participation of the private sector,” the official said.
The ministry had recently notified changes to the model concession agreements for both BOT and
TOT
(toll-operate-transfer) modes of projects, making them simpler and investor friendly to attract private investments.

“The idea is to reduce logistic costs in India, decongest India’s roads and make the road infrastructure experience world-class, befitting a developed nation,” the official added.
According to the official, the entire plan for awarding new projects is already in place and the ministry is waiting for the go-ahead on Vision 2047, after which it will start calling bids.
Besides, the ministry will continue to focus on asset monetisation and aims to garner in excess of Rs 40,000 crore through infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and securitisation in 2024-25.
The plan is also to nudge Indian enterprises to set up vehicle scrapping centres and doling out incentives to vehicle owners to opt for scrapping of their old vehicles as part of the government’s push to circular economy.
The 2024-25 interim budget has allocated Rs 2,78,000 crore for road, transport and highways as against Rs 2,70,434.71 crore initially allocated for 2023-24. The revised allocation for 2023-24 was Rs 2,76,351.45 crore.

"As India gives effect to new highway-building playbook, a key change in measuring method is coming",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/as-india-gives-effect-to-new-highway-building-playbook-a-key-change-in-measuring-method-is-coming/articleshow/109185164.cms,10-04-2024,"A new method for measuring highway construction is likely to be introduced in India, Times of India reported on April 10.
The govt is looking to modify its measuring method from ‘road km’ to ‘lane km’ from this financial year, the report said. This is part of India's shifting focus to building more expressways and roads that have at least four lanes.
To make comparison with earlier data easier, construction details of earlier years are likely to be converted to lane km, the report said citing sources.
The current method of measuring construction progress and NH widening is based on linear length, treating both a single kilometre of a six-lane road and a two-lane road as equal. Overall highway construction under the current norm is nearly at its peak and the focus now is on constructing more high-speed roads and expressways. So, the current norms may soon lose relevance, the report saying quoting a source.
Similarly, railways also measure track laying and electrification in terms of route km.

A big controversy had erupted last year when the CAG, in its report, highlighted the ""very high"" civil construction cost of the 29-km
Dwarka expressway
. It was noted that the average cost per km was Rs 251 crore, while the govt had only approved Rs 18.2 crore for the same. The
highway ministry
pointed out that the total lane km, including elevated and underground structures, was 563.
Last year, a huge controversy had broken out after CAG, in its report, pointed to “very high” civil construction cost of the 29-km Dwarka
expressway
. While it had said that average cost per km stood at Rs 251 crore against Rs 18.2 crore per km approved by govt,
The govt, in its response, had said that the stretch, including elevated and underground structures, was actually of 563 lane km.
Latest available data shows that national highway construction and widening during 2023-24 were at 12,349 km, of which 42% (5,193 km) were of more than four lanes -- a record in annual terms.

Pamban bridge: India's first vertical lift bridge over sea in Rameswaram faces 'curve' test,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/pamban-bridge-indias-first-vertical-lift-bridge-over-sea-in-rameswaram-faces-curve-test/articleshow/109168227.cms,09-04-2024,"New Delhi: A sharp curve in the upcoming Pamban railway bridge,
India
's first vertical-lift bridge connecting the country's mainland with
Rameswaram island
, has become an additional challenge for the
Railways
besides its mechanical peculiarity and a rough sea. The
Rail Vikas Nigam Limited
(RVNL), which is constructing this 2.08-km-long bridge, is facing a huge challenge in moving a lift span, which is 72.5-m-long, 16-m-wide and weighs 550 tonne, from the
Rameshwaram
end to 450 m in the sea to fix it to the bridge.
""We started moving this lift span on March 10 and till date, we have moved the 550 ton lift span 80 m towards the centre of the bridge. The biggest challenge is the 2.65 degree of curved alignment of the bridge. Had it been straight, we would have moved it faster,"" a senior official of RVNL said, adding the curved shape was essential due to various alignment changes.
The movement of lift span to its final fixing point shall be completed by the end of May, as it still has to be carried 370 m more.
""Once we cross the curved portion, we can expedite its movement. We have taken a huge precaution while moving it in the sea as its size and weight requires great precision at each step,"" the official said.
The RVNL has set a deadline of June 30 to make the bridge operational and its officials say that they are trying their level best to meet it.
Live Events
""Once the lift span is fixed, the remaining work is no big deal,"" an RVNL official said.
He added, ""This lift span can be lifted up automatically up to 17 m for ships to pass. It will take 5 minutes to go up and the same time to come down and will be scheduled in such a way so that train services shouldn't be disrupted.""
The RVNL got this lift span designed from Spanish firm TYPSA and it was manufactured at Sattirakkudi Railway Station, which is 20 km away from the sea coast.
""We brought it in various parts and assembled it here at the coast because it was not possible to carry such a huge structure from the manufacturing point,"" the RVNL official said.
The train services between Mandapam in the mainland and
Rameswaram
island were suspended on December 23, 2022 after the existing rail bridge, which was built in 1913, was declared non-operational from the safety point of view.
""When the Pamban bridge was operational, trains used to move to the bridge and reach Rameshwaram. They used to move slowly on the Pamban bridge and reach the pilgrimage town in about 15 minutes,"" a Southern Railway official said.
At present, all trains terminate at Mandapam and people use road routes to reach Rameswaram. Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
laid the foundation stone of the new bridge, parallel to the old one, in November 2019 and the work was started in February 2020 by RVNL.
It was supposed to be completed by December 2021, however, the deadline was extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the Southern Railway, the 2.08-km-long bridge will allow the
Indian Railways
to operate trains at a higher speed and it will also increase traffic between the mainland of India and Rameswaram island.
Till a road bridge was constructed in 1988, train services were the only link connecting
Mandapam to Rameswaram
island situated in the
Gulf of Mannar
.
According to the Southern Railway, the substructure of the bridge has been built for the double lines and the navigational span will also have provision for double lines.

Hyderabad’s proposed elevated corridor to boost entrepreneurial ecosystem and promote development,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/hyderabads-proposed-elevated-corridor-to-boost-entrepreneurial-ecosystem-and-promote-development/articleshow/109006169.cms,03-04-2024,"The proposed
elevated corridor
in
Hyderabad
is anticipated to have a significant impact on the
real estate development
in the city, particularly benefiting the entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially the life sciences companies.
The corridor is expected to provide seamless connectivity, reducing travel time, and increasing accessibility, thereby facilitating the growth of businesses in the area. Additionally, the elevated corridor is likely to improve the overall infrastructure of the region, making it an attractive location for investment and development.
“The futuristic and well thought out development plan for
Genome Valley
and surrounding areas initiated through this elevated corridor. It is going to boost intra-state and inter-state connectivity significantly to districts of Karimnagar and Mancherial as well as cities like
Nagpur
in Maharashtra. The project will also act as an essential for all-round development including residences, schools and higher education institutions, commercial properties, recreation facilities and hospitality outlets. By designating a 25-km radius as “Pollution Free Zone”, Genome Valley is well-suited for a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. The announcement highlights the possibilities in the scale of development that can happen when both state and central governments work towards it,” said Vishal Goel, Managing Director, Rx Propellant, a leading life sciences infrastructure platform
At Genome Valley, the company plans to develop a 9,00,000 sq ft lab space, to be operational over mid-2025. The new cluster will cater to startups, scale-ups and established contract manufacturers and multinationals in the pharma space.
In the month of March, the Ministry of Defence has approved the construction of elevated corridors across defence territory in Hyderabad, marking a significant step forward in transportation infrastructure development. The clearance came after eight years of pending requests and negotiations and will yield a significant positive impact on all three phases of Genome Valley, located across the suburbs of Turakapally, Shamirpet, Medchal, Uppal, Patancheru, Jeedimetla, Gachibowli and Keesara. The corridors are poised to further promote faster movement on critical routes such as the Hyderabad-Nagpur National Highway and the Hyderabad-Karimnagar Rajiv Highway.
Live Events
“ Rapid execution of these corridors will transform Hyderabad's transport landscape and strengthen its position as a dynamic hub for life sciences players from all over the world. We are hopeful that the announcement will speed up additional developments such as higher education institutions, recreation areas, and residences in the coming days to continue the growth streak,” says Vishal Goel, Managing Director, Rx Propellant.
The approved project encompasses two major corridors, each strategically designed to alleviate congestion and streamline traffic flow along key routes. Corridor 1 spans 18.30 kilometres from Paradise Junction near Kandlakoya to the Outer Ring Road (ORR) on Nagpur Highway (NH-44). Out of this stretch, 12.68 km will be constructed as a six-lane elevated corridor with exits and entrances at critical points. Additionally, plans have been developed for a double-decker corridor to suit future metro extension projects. Corridor 2, on the other hand, will be a 11.30-kilometre long, six-lane elevated.
Milind Ravi, CEO, Rx Propellant said that the corridor will significantly ease supply chain bottlenecks for the life sciences companies in Genome Valley, India’s first organized cluster for Life Sciences R&D and Clean Manufacturing activities. “As a new-age life sciences facilitator, we are well aware of the needs of pharmaceutical and biotech companies who are increasingly making India their home. We have been developing and delivering world-class infrastructure to promote this growth. However, suboptimal connectivity and absence of residential and other related facilities was forcing companies to provide transport services to nearly 15,000 scientific and technical professionals to and from Hyderabad city. While this increases the travel time for people, it adds to the expenses of the companies. Better connectivity with the elevated corridor will also improve their supply chain and access to talent pool of skilled professionals: it reduces travel time by 75 per cent,” he said.
Hyderabad is emerging as a life sciences hub, with global and domestic pharmaceutical firms expanding or setting up facilities in the city, including Eurofin, Syngene, and Piramal, say industry experts. The city has secured over $700 million in investments within the past year and is projected to reach $250 billion by 2030.
The city is a hub for the pharmaceutical, vaccine, and biotechnology sectors, hosting top players at the forefront of innovation and attracting investments of more than $3 billion from companies such as
Novartis
, BMS, Sanofi, and Roche, which have generated over 450,000 jobs in the last seven years.

Revised model concession agreements for toll projects will safeguard interest of all stakeholders: CareEdge Ratings,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/revised-model-concession-agreements-for-toll-projects-will-safeguard-interest-of-all-stakeholders-careedge-ratings/articleshow/108971463.cms,02-04-2024,"Revised model concession agreements for toll projects has incorporated series of favourable changes, both in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) and toll-operate-transfer (TOT), to bolster
investor confidence
while safeguarding the interest of all stakeholders, the
CareEdge Ratings
said on Tuesday.
The ministry of road transport and highways (
MoRTH
) had last month revised the MCAs for bidding out
toll road projects
as it aims to bid out 53 projects, encompassing a total length of 5,214 km and a projected cost of Rs 2.10 lakh crore, for development under the
BOT-Toll model
.
“The revised agreements have incorporated changes to tackle execution woes, ensure
funding support
during the
construction period
and mitigate lender’s risk in case of exigencies,” it said, adding it will help address challenges encountered during the execution, operational, and termination phases of BOT toll projects.
“Access to at least 90% of the construction zone on the appointed date under the revised MCA is expected to substantially minimize execution hindrances and the extent of delinking for issuance of provisional commercial operations date (PCOD),” it said.
“Further, the authority’s right to terminate slow-moving projects in the intermittent phase besides gaining online access to the escrow account will nudge developers to focus on project execution on one side while facilitating the authority to undertake timely corrective actions in languishing projects,” CareEdge Ratings observed.

According to the CareEdge Ratings report, lender’s interest under revised MCA can be protected up to a maximum limit of 54% and the compensation mechanism from authority towards revenue loss under various situations will be positive.
As per the report, the approach of offering a predetermined grant in place of toll collection rights during the construction phase is a welcome move to reduce the risk of cash flow fluctuations.
CareEdge Ratings estimates total funding support in the range of 20-32% of the total project cost from authority during the construction period.
“Nevertheless, this support from the authority is estimated to be way below the threshold of 40% of the total project cost stipulated in the concession agreement,” it said, adding that the estimated leverage of 52-64% of total project cost under revised MCA instead of leverage of 64-70% of total project cost observed in old toll concessions augurs well from a credit perspective.
“In other words, for a potential toll project capex aggregating Rs 2.10 lakh crore, peak debt requirement is likely to be lower by 10% vi-a-vis old BOT-Toll concessions,” it added.

Out of the 764 delayed projects, 188 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 185 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 275 projects for 25-60 months, and 116 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 764 delayed projects is 36.27 months.
Reasons for time overrun, as reported by various project implementing agencies, include delay in land acquisition, obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delays in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems are among other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in the implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

Road ministry amends model concession agreements for BOT and TOT projects,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/road-ministry-amends-model-concession-agreements-for-bot-and-tot-projects/articleshow/108623550.cms,19-03-2024,"The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) have made over a dozen changes to the
model concession agreement
for build-operate-transfer (
BOT
) and tolling, operation, maintenance and Transfer (
TOT
) model to incentivise private sector to invest in creation of road infrastructure and to remove any ambiguity in the existing agreements.
Some of the key amendments for capacity augmentation on BOT include construction support to the concessionaire to complete projects on time and longer tolling period to tide away losses on account of competing roads.
Besides, the amended MCA provides for clarity on the compensation to be paid by the government on account of force majeure, providing for a termination payment during construction period if 40% of the project is complete while incorporating debt and equity related provisions that will equate the cost of the project to the government projected total project cost.
Further, the authority will have the right to view and download the account statement of escrow account at all times during the concession period, a move aimed at ensuring that projects are not stuck due to paucity of funds.
“After extensive deliberations with various stakeholders and implementing agencies in this ministry, amendments have been approved in the provisions of the MCA for capacity augmentation on BOT (Toll),” the
road ministry
said in a notification.

Changes in TOT agreements
Under the amended model concession agreement for TOT projects, the frequency of checks has been increased from two to three times to ensure corresponding changes in the concession period are made upfront in case there is variation in toll collection while the threshold for checking has been reduced from 20% to 5%.
“The amendments made to the model concession agreements for TOT & BOT are largely positive for the private sector and bring better clarity on issues related to debt due, capacity augmentation and compensation payable by the authority. However, whether these changes will give a fillip to BOT projects remains to be seen,” Akshay Purkayastha, director, consulting, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics said.
The National Highways Authority of India, under MoRTH, aims to bid out 53 projects worth over Rs 2.2 lakh crore and covering a length of 5200 km.
At present, projects are being awarded on engineering procurement construction (EPC) or hybrid annuity mode (HAM) due to various challenges in implementation of BOT projects.
The government has taken many initiatives in the past for revival of BOT projects including schemes like harmonious substitution, one time fund infusion, rationalized compensation, premium deferment and allowing refinancing.

The government report noted that nearly half of the 764 delayed projects were delayed for a period of over two years. The average period of delay for these projects was 36.27 months, higher than previous month’s figure of 36.13 months.
The government has ramped up project completions since FY22; it completed 272 projects in FY22 and is due to complete nearly as many this year. Until February 2023, the government had completed 249 projects, with 20 completed in February.
“It has also been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures may be underreported,” it further said in the report.
In terms of sectoral composition, Railways faced cost overruns in over half of the projects monitored by the ministry. Among the projects facing cost overrun, the anticipated cost were 125% more than the original cost.

The
Assam government
has kept both jeep and elephant safaris ready for Modi, who will enjoy any of the rides or both, he added.
""This will be the first visit of Modi to the world heritage site. And I believe he must be the first prime minister to stay overnight at Kaziranga, but I have to check the records,"" Sarma said.
After this, the PM will depart for Arunachal Pradesh, where he will attend two functions before returning to Assam's Jorhat district, he added.
""After landing at Hollongapar helipad, he will inaugurate the 125-foot tall statue of Ahom general Lachit Borphukan. The statue, constructed by Ram Vanji Sutar, has a height of 84 feet. With the pedestal measuring 41 feet, the total height of the statue stands at 125 feet,"" Sarma said.
In February 2022, then President Ram Nath Kovind had launched the 400th birth anniversary celebrations of Lachit Borphukan and laid the foundation of a 150-foot bronze statue of the legendary commander, to be constructed at his memorial in an area of over 16.5 acres at Hollongapar near Teok.
""The statue is in the first phase and work for the second phase is going on. A gallery with the history of the Ahom dynasty's 600 years rule will be presented, while another gallery will have contemporary Assam history. An auditorium having a capacity to accommodate 500 people will also be constructed. The total project cost will be Rs 214 crore,"" Sarma said.
Lachit Borphukan was a legendary army commander of the Ahom kingdom (1228-1826). He is known for his leadership in the 1671 'Battle of Saraighat' on Brahmaputra that thwarted a drawn-out attempt by the mighty Mughal forces, led by Raja Ramsingh-I, to take back Assam.
After the statue's inauguration, Modi will go to Meleng in Jorhat district by road to roll out a number of infrastructure development projects, funded by both state and central governments, and address the public.
""He will hand over 5,55,555 Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) houses to the beneficiaries, marking a significant milestone as the largest number of houses inaugurated in a single day in the country. He will also inaugurate the Tinsukia Medical College and Hospital and lay the foundation for Sivasagar Medical College and Hospital,"" Sarma said.
Modi will also inaugurate a child cancer treatment project worth Rs 300 crore at Dr B Borooah Cancer Institute (BBCI) in Guwahati under the PM-DevINE scheme, he added.
The chief minister said other projects that the prime minister will inaugurate are capacity expansions of refineries at Digboi to 1 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA) from 0.65 MMTPA (Rs 768 crore) and Guwahati to 1.2 MMTPA from 1 MMTPA (Rs 510 crore).
Modi will also start the expansion work for IOC's Betkuchi terminal (Rs 277 crore), partial inauguration of Barauni-Numaligarh gas pipeline up to Guwahati (Rs 3,992 crore), and dedicate OIL's two pumping stations for supplying crude from Guwahati to Bongaigaon (Rs 572 crore) and from Duliajan to Digboi (Rs 51 crore), he added.
""Besides, the PM will inaugurate two railway projects for doubling of tracks, worth Rs 1,328 crore. The first one is from Dhupdhara to Chhaygaon and the other is from New Bongaigaon to Sarbhog,"" Sarma said.
After the function, he will leave for West Bengal on Saturday evening, he added.
Asked if the two-day visit will be a kind of Modi's beginning of the election campaign in Assam, Sarma said, ""The PM comes to the Northeast frequently. This will be his third visit to Assam this year (2023-24). I don't think it has any relation to the elections. If Lachit Borphukan's statue was ready earlier, he would have come then.""

Road ministry to undertake real-time monitoring of bridges on national highways via sensors to avoid any mishap,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/road-ministry-to-undertake-real-time-monitoring-of-bridges-on-national-highways-via-sensors-to-avoid-any-mishap/articleshow/108264503.cms,06-03-2024,"The ministry of road transport and highways will undertake real-time health monitoring of different categories of
bridges
on
national highways
using
sensors
, a move aimed at preventing traffic disruptions and untoward incidents due to failure of bridges.
The sensors will help in collection of real time data and permanent monitoring of bridges especially bridges located in highly saline or polluted environments and hence needs to be installed either at the time of construction for new bridges or subsequently installed at existing bridges during operation stage.
The ministry has issued guidelines for installing sensors and monitoring of bridges and has entrusted the road consultants preparing the detailed project reports (DPRs) to factor in the cost of sensors while preparing the DPRs.
“While preparing DPRs for proposed bridges, the DPR consultant shall finalise the exact type, numbers and locations of sensors and include the same in the cost estimates and scope of work,” the ministry said in a recent notification.
The ministry is of the view that condition assessment of the bridges is an important requirement for carrying out preventive maintenance and repair, rehabilitation, retrofitting and reconstruction of a bridge in time to avoid any mishap in future.

The sensors will be expected to collect data on key indicators of the bridge including parameters like strain, deflection, vibration, tilt, displacement, temperature, corrosion and scour and this data will then be analyzed using suitable software tools and models to determine the condition of the bridge.
The move has been triggered after a series of incidents of bridge collapse in the last few years including the collapse of a portion of an under-construction bridge near Ghori in Bihar’s Kishanganj district in 2023.

One Vehicle, One FASTag
' initiative compliance deadline to March-end, in view of the problems being faced by
Paytm FASTag users
, a senior official said.
NHAI
had earlier proposed to implement 'One Vehicle, One FASTag' initiative from March 1.
""In view of the Patym crisis, the FASTAg users may be given more time to shift to one vehicle-one FASTag norm,"" the official told PTI on condition of anonymity.
To enhance the efficiency of the electronic toll collection system and provide seamless movement at toll plazas, the NHAI has taken the 'One Vehicle, One FASTag' initiative that aims to discourage the use of single FASTag for multiple vehicles or linking multiple FASTags to a particular vehicle.
Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had advised customers as well as merchants of
Paytm
Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL) to shift their accounts to other banks by March 15.
The RBI also said withdrawal or utilisation of balances by PPBL customers from their accounts, including saving bank accounts, current accounts, prepaid instruments, FASTags, National Common Mobility Cards, will be permitted without any restrictions, up to their available balance even beyond March 15.

As per the government data, 794 km of six or eight-lane highways have been built in the country in the 10 months of the current fiscal between April and January 2024, compared to 753 km during the same period in 2022-23 and 715 km in 2021-22.
The four-lang highways, on the other hand, have gone up to 2,503 km between April and January this year as against 2,093 km in 2022-23 and 1,684 km in 2021-22 while the construction of two-lane roads stood at 2,805 km vis-a-vis 2,331 km in 2022-23 and 2,269 km in 2021-22.
The strengthening of national highways, however, has come down to 1,556 km in the April-January period of the ongoing fiscal compared to 1,625 km in 2022-23 and 2,016 km in 2021-22. “This is because strengthening of roads is a cyclical process and generally picks up every five years,” secretary Jain added.
Jain added that the government is focussing on achieving zero maintenance complaints, zero arbitration and enhancing road safety by eliminating all black spots on the highways.
“We hope to award all contracts for elimination of remaining 3,000 black spots in June when the model code of conduct is lifted and are actively finalising the detailed project reports of all such projects,” he said.

India
to collaborate more with
Europe
to further the growth of its
maritime economy
, TK Ramachandran, secretary of the Ministry of Ports, shipping, and Waterways, said Tuesday at the 2

CII
India Europe
Business and Sustainability Conclave in Delhi.
“India as a maritime nation is poised for growth, and there is a lot of potential available, especially with Europe. We have identified several areas where we are already collaborating, and there is scope for a lot of collaboration in the future,” Ramachandran said.
Ramachandran, in his presentation, noted that while the India-Middle-East-Europe Connectivity Corridor (
IMEEC
) “has the potential to unlock deep cooperation”, the country could also gain from best practices of shipbuilding and repair followed in Europe and attract investments in green shipbuilding.
Ramachandran highlighted that India had made strides in doubling port capacity and increasing the national waterway cargo carrying capacity by 17 times over the last decade, but more could be done.
“We have created a maritime development fund, which we are going to take forward,” Ramachandran said, highlighting the need for the
shipping sector
to attain infrastructure status for long-term financing.

The secretary, besides developing green ports and one new major port at Vadhavan, also emphasised the role of technology to improve efficiency.
“A lot of digital technologies, robotics to ensure that ports are efficient will be deployed,” he noted.
He noted that while the development of the Blue economy by 2047 would require investment of nearly $1 trillion, the ministry was eyeing financial support from state-owned banks and development banks.
The government last year, had announced that it had secured over Rs 10 lakh crore in investment at the Global Maritime India Summit 2023.

The ratio of cost overrun in large
central government
projects declined in January to 18.41%, after a three-month high of 18.65% in December.
The ministry classifies cost overrun when the project's anticipated cost exceeds the original cost. A time overrun is calculated when the project exceeds the stipulated time allotted for the completion of the project.
The anticipated cost of 1,821 projects valued over Rs 150 crore and above at Rs 30.9 lakh crore was higher than the original cost by Rs 4.8 lakh crore.
Among sectors, while
Railways
and Road Transport and Highways accounted for three-fourths of the projects facing
cost overruns
, as a proportion of their total projects, the ratio was also high for Railways at 55%.
Nearly 40% of projects in Railways and Roads also faced time overruns.
Nearly 373 projects were without a proper date of commissioning, as per ministry data. The extent of cost overruns may be further obfuscated as certain agencies have not revised cost estimates.
“It has also been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures may be underreported,” it said.

India's longest transportation tunnel opens in Jammu on Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramula Rail Link,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/indias-longest-rail-tunnel-opens-in-jammu-on-udhampur-srinagar-baramula-rail-link/articleshow/107849165.cms,20-02-2024,"The longest transportation tunnel of the country on the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) was opened by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
on Monday as he flagged off the first
electrified trains
of the
Kashmir valley
.
""Prime Minister Modi was present in
Jammu
and he virtually flagged off two electrified trains simultaneously -- one from Srinagar to Sangaldan in the down direction and the other from Sangaldan to Srinagar in the up direction,"" a railway official said.
He added that the prime minister also inaugurated the 48.1-km-long
Banihal-Khari-Sumber-Sangaldan section
. ""This longest tunnel, which is 12.77-km long and known as T-50, falls between the Khari-Sumber section,"" the official said.
According to the Northern Railway (NR), trains can now run from Baramulla to Sangaldan via Banihal, which used to be the last or originating station earlier.
T-50 is supposed to be the most challenging of the 11 tunnels in the Banihal-Khari-Sumber-Sangadal section.
Live Events
According to railway officials associated with the project, the tunnel work started around 2010 and it took almost 14 years to operationalise it.
""All safety measures have been taken inside the tunnel to meet emergency situations. An escape tunnel has been constructed parallel to T-50 to evacuate passengers in case of any emergency,"" an official said.
""At every 375 metres, a connecting passage between the escape tunnel and T-50 has been made so that the passengers can be brought to the escape tunnel and then, carried to their desired destinations in vehicles,"" he added.
The official told PTI that in order to tackle a fire incident, water pipes have been laid on both sides of the tunnel with an opening valve provided at every 375 metres so that water can be sprayed on a train from both sides to douse the flames.
""Escape tunnels have been created for other bigger tunnels too,"" he said.
According to NR officials, the opening up of the Banihal-Khari-Sumber-Sangaldan section has brought them a step closer to achieving the dream of running a train from the Kasmir valley in the north to Kanyakumari on the southern tip of the country.
""Earlier, eight diesel trains (four each from one side) were operating between Baramulla and Banihal. Today, Prime Minister Modi not only inaugurated the extension of the Banihal route to Sangaldan via Khari and Samber, but also flagged off the first electrified trains on the whole route from Baramulla to Sangaldan,"" the official said.
Now, eight electrified trains have started running between Baramulla and Banihal and four of those have been extended to Sangaldan.
""The four other trains will also be extended up to Sangaldan after a couple of months,"" the official added.
According to experts associated with the project, the first section of the USBRL -- the Quazigund-Baramulla section -- was operationalised by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2009. In July 2013, the Banihal-Quazigund section, which included the operationalisation of the 11.2-km-long T-80 Pir Panjal tunnel, was opened.
""Once the complete USBRL opens in the coming months, passengers will enjoy infrastructural marvels, such as the Chenab bridge, the highest railway bridge in the world, and the Anji bridge, which is the first cable-stayed bridge of the Indian Railways,"" an NR official said, adding that the total length of the USBRL is 272 km and the cost of the project is Rs 41,119 crore.

The master plan being prepared aims to improve connectivity and provide more affordable housing, among other things, to people living in the region, a statement by The Wadhwa Group said on February 20.
Several large projects have already been set in motion in the region, the most significant among them being the

These projects, once completed, will speed up economic development in the MMR, increase employment opportunities for the people, and provide housing across different price segments for the people in the region, Wadhwa Group said.
According to the Wadhwa Group statement, ""Realty prices in Mumbai that are anywhere within 50 minutes of travel from South Mumbai are priced not less than Rs 35,000/- to Rs 40,000/- per sq ft. This is in sharp contrast to Panvel, where traveling across the harbor by the MTHL takes 50 minutes; but surprisingly property prices here are just 1/3 rd to that of Mumbai. In this short commute time, a home buyer or investor gets a more reasonably priced home that comes along with better infrastructure and cleaner air to breathe with a higher AQI.
Here is a detailed look at the projects that are set to change the face of MMR:
Navi Mumbai airport:
The Navi Mumbai International Airport will come up in four phases between now and 2032. When operational, a total of 142,000 direct and 200,000 indirect jobs are estimated to be generated as a result of the project.
Mass transit system:
The government is also planning a quick mass transit system. It has approved a new 33.15-kilometer Metro Railway project connecting Navi Mumbai International Airport with Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.
Coastal Road to NMIA:
The Ulwe Coastal Road will help in connecting MTHL to the Navi Mumbai International Airport. This connector will drastically reduce travel time and provide ease of travel to commuters, commuting between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The 7-km-long road will connect MTHL Junction to Amra Marg Junction in Belapur.
International Corporate Park:
Plans are on cards to develop Kharghar into an International Corporate Park on the lines of Mumbai’s BKC. It is just 12 kilometers away from the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. It will have corporate offices, hospitality, educational institutions, entertainment, and healthcare facilities for residents.
Navi Mumbai Integrated Industrial Township:
The state government has also decided to develop the Navi Mumbai Integrated Industrial Township as the new IT and service sector hub of Maharashtra, in addition to promoting educational and research institutes here. The Maharashtra government is working on building several data centers, within which 65 percent of India’s data capacity is planned to be developed in Navi Mumbai itself.
30-km-long suburban rail corridor connecting Karjat with Panvel:
Work on the 30-km-long suburban rail corridor connecting Karjat with Panvel has also started. This route will reduce the travel time from CSMT to Karjat by more than 20 minutes. It will provide an alternative route from Mumbai to Karjat via Panvel. This suburban corridor will enhance economic development in the fast-developing areas of Panvel, Karjat, and NAINA (Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area).

Two of these corridors are already in the final stages of development, marking a crucial milestone in the project's progression, said Infrastructure Development Minister MB Patil. “The implementation of BSRP (Bengaluru Suburban Railway Project) funded by the loan will contribute to better mobility for citizens, reduced vehicular pollution, and the creation of a better environment resulting in improved quality of life in the city of Bengaluru,” he added.
Once completed, these 148 kilometers of railway tracks will have a total of 58 stations, and are expected to cater to approximately 10 lakh commuters daily, bridging the connectivity gap between Bangalore city and its outer zones. The total project is to be built at a cost of over Rs. 15,700 crore.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the BSRP in June 2022, and had set a deadline of 40 months for the completion of the project. The primary agreement for the loan had been signed between the Centre’s Department of Economic Affairs and KFW in December last year, with the supplementary agreement ratified on Friday.

NHAI
) has raised the highest ever
concession value
of Rs 15,624.90 crore through ’
InvIT Round-3
’ which includes monetizing 10 stretches with an aggregate length of about 890 km.
This is spread across Assam, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The monetized value is expected to be realized in March 2024, the ministry of
road transport and highways
said on Tuesday.
Earlier, two rounds of InvIT with aggregate length of about 635 km worth Rs 10,200 crore were monetized.
“With this, NHAI’s total
asset monetization program
has crossed Rs 1 lakh crore which includes Rs 42,334 crore through toll-operate-transfer (TOT), Rs 26,125 crore through InvIT and Rs 42,000 crore through
securitization
,” it added.
ET had reported on January 18 that NHAI will surpass Rs 1 lakh crore of asset monetisation in the current fiscal with the highest ever receipts in 2023-24.
Live Events
The monetized sections in ’InvIT Round-3’ include Chichira-Kharagpur, Orai-Bara, Rewa-Katni-Jabalpur-Lakhnadon, Kachugaon to Rakhaldubi Bus Junction and Rakhaldubi Bus Junction to Kaljhar, Kaljhar to Patacharkuchi, Lakhnadon to Mahagaon, Mahagaon to Khawasa, Hubli to Haveri, Davangere to Haveri and Davangere to Chitradurga.
NHAI has adopted three modes for
asset monetization
which includes Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvITs), toll operate transfer (TOT), and project based securitization.
During FY 2024, NHAI has already awarded and executed Concession Agreements for four TOT Bundles, which include TOT Bundles 11, 12, 13 and 14 for a total value of Rs 15,968 crore, which is higher than its monetization target of Rs 10,000 crore for the current fiscal year.

“Additionally, Rs 9,000 crore has been planned to be monetized through this mode in this fiscal year,” it said.
According to the ministry of
road transport
and highways, NHAI has been able to mobilize budgetary resources with its asset monetization program to meet its
capital
expenditure and debt servicing requirements.
“This is in line with the government’s vision under the National Monetization Plan as well as fulfillment of the government’s budgetary announcements,” it added.

NHAI arm lens on Paytm for FASTags,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/nhai-arm-lens-on-paytm-for-fastags/articleshow/107503062.cms,08-02-2024,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Highways Management Company Ltd (
IHMCL
) is scrutinising responses from
Paytm Payments Bank
to determine whether it followed customer verification norms when issuing
FASTags
and decide any potential action against it, people in know of the developments told ET.
IHMCL, which operates under the National Highways Authority of India (
NHAI
), had in its letter dated January 19, 2024, barred
Paytm
Payments Bank from issuing fresh FASTags and taking up new toll plazas due to non-compliance with mandatory know your customer (KYC) norms.
IHMCL also found that Paytm Payments Bank had not even updated vehicle chassis numbers and registration numbers and issued multiple FASTags for the same car or vice-versa. ""Paytm Payments Bank has defended itself saying it complies with all the norms. However, the auditors are scrutinising the responses of Paytm following which the government will decide on the future course of action,"" said one of the persons cited above.
A spokesperson for Paytm Payments Bank, however, said IHMCL has been completely satisfied with the progress made on the observations in the audit report of its FASTag services. ""We currently hold a significant market share in FASTag services and are actively working on a resolution with NHAI. We are hopeful that the millions of users relying on FASTag for their daily commute will not be impacted,"" the spokesperson said in response to ET's queries.
A second person cited above said NHAI is mulling over ways to help Paytm FASTag users to migrate to other banks.

) curative petition seeking reversal of the apex court's 2021 judgment upholding a ₹4,700-crore arbitration award that Delhi Airport Metro Express (DAMEPL), a subsidiary of
Reliance Infrastructure
, won against the former in May 2017.
At the outset, a bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud said that its tentative view is to constitute a five-judge bench to hear the case. ""...Normally, the two judges who wrote the judgment have to sit (in curative). They have retired... My tentative view is we can hear in combination of five (judges),"" it said.
Meanwhile, senior counsel Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi said the grounds for filing the curative petition by DMRC were not met in the case, therefore, it should be rejected.
Salve argued, ""I am flabbergasted that no ground for entertaining a curative petition is made out. Let them state specifically the ground on which curative is sought.""
Rohatgi, also appearing for the RInfra subsidiary, said, ""We have taken a preliminary objection to this petition. Neither violation of natural justice nor any other ground mentioned in Rupa Ashok Hurra case is made out."" DAMEPL operated the Capital's airport metro service until 2013 before cancelling the contract with DMRC citing safety issues and invoked arbitration.
Live Events
In 2017, Delhi Airport Metro Express had won a ₹4,700 crore arbitration award against Delhi Metro Rail Corp. The arbitral tribunal had accepted the claim of the RInfra firm that running trains on the airport line wasn't viable due to structural defects in the viaduct made by Delhi Metro Rail. Since then, the amount with interest has swelled to round ₹9,000 crore.

The interim budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday allocated ₹2.78 lakh crore for roads, transport and highways as against ₹2.70 lakh crore allocated in FY24, revised subsequently to ₹2.76 lakh crore.
Vinayak Chatterjee, founder of The Infravision Foundation, said the increase in
road sector
allocation, while small, is in line with the overall carry-on nature of the increase in
infrastructure
allocation.
""With NHAI constrained to raise further debt, the full final budget is expected to increase outlays substantially more as the government rides on economic growth on the back of robust infrastructure creation,"" Chatterjee said.
Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, senior director at CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics, added that the low increase in budgetary allocation to the road sector comes on a high base and most of it is a committed outlay for existing projects.

investment
,"" he said, adding, even the asset monetisation will continue to play an important role for the government to raise capital.
The government aims to bid out 54 road projects worth over ₹2.2 lakh crore, covering a length of 5,200 km on the BOT model and will soon modify the model concession agreement to attract private investment into the sector. The ministry has already invited bids for seven projects with a length of 387 km worth ₹27,000 crore.
The cost of construction material has seen a 6% increase in one year, and hence, experts say, the real hike in capex is not more than 5%, which is not enough to push economic growth to levels beyond 7%.
The government is committed to reduce travel time, enhance travel experience and bring down logistics costs in the country. Sitharaman announced an increase of 11.1% in the infrastructure expenditure at ₹11,11,111 crore against a budgetary allocation of ₹10 lakh crore in 2023-24, ₹7.5 lakh crore in 2022-23 and ₹5.54 lakh crore in 2021-22.
The government estimates that infrastructure expenditure has a multiplier effect of 2.45 on GDP in the year of capital expenditure and 3.14 in the next.

According to Padmanabhan, development of economic rail corridors (commodity specific) will help to de-congest existing lines (mostly eastern part of the country), aid in faster freight movement and in reducing the logistics cost and increasing manufacturing competitiveness.
“Having a focused approach for aiding freight movement will help in achieving the National Rail Plan targets having a 50% modal share in the medium term,” he added.
Though there is consensus among experts that the budgetary allocation is below expectation, there is hope of a higher allocation when the government presents the full Budget after the General Elections in April-May this year.

The government had hiked its capital expenditure (

However, the on-year jump in capex target for the next fiscal sharply lags that of 37% spike for this fiscal year as the government has restricted public spending to stick to fiscal consolidation, even as a big push in capex is crucial for India’s growth dreams to become the third largest economy in the world and create ample jobs.

Key announcements for different industries
""The 11.1% higher capex budgeted for infrastructure is lower than what has been the run rate in the previous years. This implies the private sector will have to step in if the growth momentum has to be maintained,"" CRISIL said.
Capital expenditure means spending on infrastructure such as roads and railways. For this fiscal year, India had set a record capex target of Rs.10 lakh crore, a 37.4% increase from the revised
budget
estimate of Rs 7.28 lakh crore for FY23, which was almost three times of Rs 3.11 lakh crore capital expenditure in FY20 when Modi had returned to power for a second term with a massive victory in Lok Sabha elections.
""Despite being an election year, the government's continued commitment to productive capital expenditure, even at the expense of revenue expenditure, is a welcome move. The overall subsidy outgo has reduced in FY25, mainly due to reduction in fertilizer subsidy,"" said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at CareEdge.

Here are 10 key announcements for common man
India's capex in FY21 and FY22 stood at Rs 4.1 lakh crore and Rs 5.9 lakh crore, respectively.
ET had reported earlier citing unnamed sources that the government sought to prioritise fiscal consolidation since the economy is growing at a robust pace.
The government expects the economy to grow at a faster pace of 7.3% in the current financial year than the 7.2% surge in the previous year and also above the RBI’s projection of 7% growth, even as the global economy grapples with numerous uncertainties including geopolitical tensions.
However, some economists have indicated that the economy would find it much more difficult to sustain this momentum unless consumption picks up. Some economists also deemed the 7.3% growth target to be unlikely given the slowing capex and tepid agriculture outlook.
Industry body FICCI had said India's growth trends leading up to the
Interim Budget
have been robust but the government would need to continue its thrust on public capex in view of the current global headwinds.
India has also seen a sluggish private capex during the Narendra Modi government’s tenure, though there has been a slight uptick recently. The government hopes to meet this challenge by trying to create a virtuous cycle --- successively increasing public capex, the spending on infrastructure such as roads and railways, in the hope of crowding in private capex which is necessary for an economy dreaming to become the third largest in the world and achieve $5 trillion GDP.
To be sure, ET had reported that several top industry officials believe the momentum for capital investments remains strong and transient pressures will not impact companies' making long-term bets on domestic growth. As a result, the long-awaited boom in private sector capital expenditure appears to be closer to reality.
The Central government hopes for a further economic boost through the wide multiplier effect of public capex which can create more jobs, as well as spur demand, which can lead businesses and industry to spend more money on capital expenditure.
""The interim budget commendably shunned any populist measures so often resorted to by the governments. But Bharat could certainly do more on its infrastructure CAPEX budgeting which increased nominally by 11%,"" said Gopichand P. Hinduja, Chairman, the Hinduja Group.

While an HFC must commit 60% of its assets to finance housing projects, an IFC can invest in a wide array of projects like energy transition and urbanisation. The official said Hudco is also looking to finance projects in energy transition.
""IFC status gives the ability to access a larger investor base, which in turn helps IFC entities to diversify their resource base, and therefore better optimise their borrowing,"" said Subha Sri Narayanan, Director,
CRISIL Ratings

The techno-financing public sector undertaking has been trying to get IFC status for almost two years. On March 29, 2022, the company submitted its application to the central bank to convert to an IFC.

"Budget 2024: Madam Finance Minister, amplify your investments",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/budget-2024-madam-finance-minister-amplify-your-investments/articleshow/107298792.cms,31-01-2024,"During Union
budget
for FY24, Hon’ble Finance Minister increased the allocation for infrastructure to Rs 10 lakh crores. This was not only a continuation of increase in absolute amount year on year, but also as its share in GDP to 3.4%. Hon’ble Finance Minister also offered 50 years interest free loan to the States to help them do their bit towards quality infrastructure development.
The capital spend during FY24 has been broad based and not just focussed on the traditional highways and railways sectors. According to the CMIE, private sector investment in India has improved due to government initiatives. The CMIE data shows that the value of new investment proposals by the private sector nearly doubled from Rs 3 lakh crores in April-December 2022 to Rs 6 lakh crores in April-December 2023. From the capex cycle peak of GFCF being at 36% of GDP in FY08, share of investment in the economy declined to a low of 27% in FY21. The GFCF is now expected to rise to a near decade high of 30% in FY24 and improve further in coming years. Strong tax collections and subdued social spending has allowed the Government to raise its capital expenditure by 3x over past 5 years. The surge in infrastructure investment is part of a long-term strategy to promote Indian economic growth. The focus on infrastructure investment is a boon for a nation hoping to improve its standing among other countries and will prove invaluable when offering itself to global partners as an alternate manufacturing location.
Infrastructure investment by Government, real estate sector upswing, and improving private capital investment have collectively made India the fastest growing large economy globally over the last 2 years. Overall capacity utilisation, as measured by the RBI, has inched up to 73.6% and is now above its 10-year average. Real estate and corporate capex, contributing ~75% of private capital investment, were subdued for last several years and have now started picking up. Government has approved PLI schemes worth Rs 2 lakh crores across 14 sectors; Semiconductors, automobiles, electronics manufacturing and renewable energy being the key focus areas. Healthy corporate balance sheets, supply-side reforms like lower tax on new manufacturing plants, Government incentives for various sectors and well capitalized banking system are providing the tailwinds and should be significant growth drivers over next few years.
While the playbook for capital investment is in place and should drive Indian economic growth, in near term however, Indian GDP growth is expected to slow down in FY25 due to global slowdown, geopolitical uncertainties and patchy monsoon. As Indian exports contribute ~20% of India’s GDP, slowdown in other economies is bound to have impact on our exports as well. Further, private consumption, which accounts for 57% of GDP, has also decelerated in recent quarters due to a decline in rural incomes. One could see the impact of these factors playing out in Q3 earnings of IT and FMCG companies. Per se, Government policy support would be required to keep the Indian growth engine running at high speed.
The options for Government to provide policy support however would be limited as budget consolidation on the top of lower economic growth takes its toll on the financials. From the fiscal deficit of 5.9% in FY24, the Government needs to hit its goal of 4.5% by FY26, a steep improvement metric for any Government. As such, unlike previous years, we don’t expect more than 10-15% increase in infrastructure spend.
Live Events
The funding available with Government may be limited, but the demands are not. According to India Rating & Research, India’s per capita infrastructure investment at US$ 91 is far lower than USA at US$ 938, China at US$ 622 and Brazil at US$ 256. India has set itself a target to be a developed country by 2047 with its GDP at US$ 30 trillion. This journey would require concomitant infrastructure capacity to be created.
Additionally, India has committed to net Zero by 2070. This would require serious investment, expected to be in the range of US$ 10 trillion. The hydrogen sector by itself is poised to attract considerable outlay, estimated at around Rs 1.5 lakh crores between fiscals 2024 and 2030. Since the entire world is on its journey to net Zero and the technology road map is still evolving, India has a unique opportunity to take a leadership role in developing/ testing new technologies, build global scale in supplying green energy and green products to the world. This would require a multi-pronged mission approach by providing incentives and regulations to reduce carbon footprint, scaling up renewable energy sources, supporting innovation & research in emerging technologies such as carbon capture/ storage/ negative emissions, and most importantly channelising large scale investment into green hydrogen through mandates. The green investments would not only improve air quality and health of our citizens but also provide energy security and create jobs.
When the Finance Minister presents the budget for FY25, one of the key objectives should be to amplify its limited spending budget. This should be done by increasing its role as an investment facilitator rather than direct investment. India has not benefited much from the growing weariness of investing in China and needs to tackle this issue urgently. The Government should enhance the PLI scheme for various sectors and introduce fresh manufacturing segments to make India a global hub of innovation and competitiveness. The Government should also enhance incentives and subsidies towards affordable housing projects to provide housing security. Now that India has come out of its twin balance sheet problem and there is improved risk appetite, it should divert more highway and railways projects towards PPP model rather than EPC. Further, the Government should define green standards and mandate a transition to green construction in all infrastructure projects. The research and innovation towards net Zero should be incentivised by an enabling tax structure and Government playing a role of partner in such investments.
Lastly, it is also time that the investment by Government be complemented by that of Central PSUs. With the PSUs basket leading the current bull run, the aggregate market capitalisation of the PSUs has scaled past Rs 50 lakh crore for the first time ever. The stock prices of 23 PSUs rose over 2x in 2023. As of Dec 31, 2023, the market capitalisation of non-BFSI Central PSUs was more than Rs 22 lakh crores.
The Government has till date in FY24 raised closed to Rs 10 thousand crores through divestment of its shareholding in the PSUs. The disinvestment target for the year is Rs 50 thousand crores. These disinvestments while helping the Government in plugging its fiscal deficit, necessitates a rethink. The market capitalization of these PSUs could be further improved if the overhang of owner stake was removed. Further, investors also traditionally prefer to invest into the company instead of participating in secondary sale of shares, as primary capital creates further capacity into the company and improves prospects.
In essence, Hon’ble Finance Minister should consider discontinuing the disinvestment and direct some of its infrastructure and net Zero investments through these PSUs. An equity raising from the stock market to the extent of 10% of non-BFSI market capitalisation, along with supporting debt leverage on the PSU balance sheet, would create additional investment capacity of over Rs 11 lakh crores. This is more than the entire capital outlay by Central Government in FY24.

Budget 2024: Need for Infra Push 2.0 to make India's roads & railways one of world's best,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/budget-2024-need-for-infra-push-2-0-to-make-indias-roads-railways-one-of-worlds-best/articleshow/107282175.cms,31-01-2024,"Budget expectations
: India has made significant strides in improving its infrastructure capacity in recent years. A large part of this has been primarily government funded. The upcoming budget could most likely be void of any big bang announcements – expected of a typical
interim budget
– but in spirit the push towards infrastructure could continue.
How much India spends for infra boost?
The government has spent a whopping 23 lakh crore rupees on infrastructure spending over the last three years (FY22-FY24). The infrastructure focus is apparent when one looks at the capital spending to GDP ratio which has almost doubled from 1.6 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 to 3.2 per cent of GDP in 2023-24. Of this, the major push has come in building roads, highways, and railways with almost 40 per cent of total capital spending this year allocated to these sectors. Furthermore, the government has incentivised states to jump on the infrastructure bandwagon by offering long-term interest free capex loans in recent years.
What has India earned from infra push?
This strategy seems to have worked well so far. India has seen an increase in the average availability of power (in hours) across both rural and urban areas, an accelerated pace of highway and rural roads construction, increase in number of airports and domestic passenger traffic,
railway line electrification and improvement in major port cargo handling capacities
among other things. The strides are apparent even in a global context. For instance, India’s ranking in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) jumped up 6 places to 38 in 2023 from 44 in 2018 with significant improvements in infrastructure surrounding international shipments and India’s logistics quality.
The road ahead for infra & need for Budget boost
But the task ahead is now to sustain and broaden India’s infrastructure capacities. For 2024-25, this could be particularly challenging since the
government looks at consolidating its fiscal position and reducing its fiscal deficit target
to align with its medium-term fiscal goals (of reaching 4.5 percent of GDP by 2026). This would automatically limit the pace of growth in infrastructure spending ahead. While the government could still target to spend close to 11 lakh crore rupees on infrastructure in the upcoming fiscal year, it could become increasingly difficult for government spending to keep up pace with economic growth going forward.

Budget 2024: Higher capex for infrastructure likely with green focus
Therefore, there is a greater need to incentivise the private sector to finance and partake in the next infrastructure development wave.
So, what should infrastructure push 2.0 look like?
For one, a shift in focus towards building social infrastructure including in
sectors like health, education and housing
remains critical in augmenting India’s potential growth and its
position in the global economy both as a large consumer and a manufacturing base
.
Previous budgets have tried to address some of these issues, but a greater focus and push is now imperative. For instance, the Government started the PM Awas Yojana (Urban) in 2015 with “housing for all” as the key objective. As per the latest data, only 1.2 Crores houses have been constructed so far versus the target of 2 Crore houses. Similarly, on the health front, the WHO has recommended a ratio of 3 beds per 1,000 people for India (versus 1.3 currently), which will require availability of an additional 2.4 million hospital beds.

Secondly, infrastructure spending must also focus on preparing India’s transition to a green economy over the medium term. This could entail higher spending on building renewable capacities, supporting infrastructure for energy transition, and incentivising a faster adoption of green technology. In 2023-24, the budget allocated 35,000 crore rupees towards energy transition, net zero objectives and energy security. However, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas has so far spent a miniscule amount of this allocation (INR 0.29 Crore) till November 2023. Therefore, there is also a need to devise a roadmap and identify projects to efficiently utilise any allocations in the future.
The other area which needs to get greater focus in
India infrastructure
spending plans is tourism. This would not only generate a new revenue stream for the economy (increasing foreign exchange earnings) but also help carry the burden of an expanding work force given the labour-intensive nature of the tourism sector. India’s tourism industry roughly accounts for 5 per cent of GDP in comparison to countries like Thailand where the sector accounts for well over 10 per cent of its GDP.
India has so far checked the right boxes in terms of enhancing its infrastructure capacity, but a new avatar of its spending strategy is now needed. Infrastructure push 2.0 needs to focus on building sustainable (green) and social capacities for India to compete and increase its share in the global supply chain. The hope is that the interim budget gets the ball rolling on at least some of these aspects.

The lender is in talks with
financial institutions
, such as the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID),
Punjab National Bank

""SBI is down-selling Ganga Expressway loans to banks and financial institutions and is in the last leg of the process,"" a banking industry source told ET. ""SBI underwrote the entire amount with a view of down-selling part of it. It is up to the bank's risk management team to decide on how much to keep and how much to down-sell.""
It is a standard practice in the infrastructure financing space for banks to downsell portions of large loan exposures.
At least four lenders have shown interest in buying the debt from SBI, including National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID),

The loan, which is long term, fits well with the portfolio of NaBFID, an infrastructure-focused financier, as it seeks to sanction up to ₹1 lakh crore by March 2024. So far, it has disbursed ₹21,000 crore of loans, another source said.
SBI refrained from selling down a portion of the loan in the previous year. The bank may decide to proportionately sell down the loan to all lenders based on their sanctions, the source added.
Spokespersons of SBI, NaBFID and REC did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Union Bank of India could not be immediately reached.
The Ganga expressway in Uttar Pradesh, which will connect Meerut with Prayagraj, is going to be India's longest expressway implemented on a toll basis. In 2021, Adani had won contracts from the Uttar Pradesh government to build three stretches of the 594-km Ganga Expressway while the fourth section was awarded to
IRB Infrastructure
. Of its 594-km length, the Adani group is building 464 km from Budaun to Prayagraj, which comprises 80% of the expressway project.

""A ropeway, a cable car, or a sky bus can be run on the lake (Bhopal's Upper Lake). We will surely help if you (
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister
Mohan Yadav) send a proposal,"" he said and added that the tenders for all 27 rope-way works will be issued soon.
He also said good roads will attract industries and capital investment, which will give a boost to employment in MP and also eradicate poverty.
Gadkari appealed to CM Yadav to provide government land along the ring road so that logistics parks, cold storage and industrial clusters could be developed with the Central fund.
He also said a multi-modal logistics park, costing Rs 1,111 crore, is proposed on a 255-acre land.
Gadkari said the 245-km stretch of the
Delhi-Mumbai Expressway
, costing Rs 20,000 crore, is passing from Madhya Pradesh and the distance between both cities will be covered in 12 hours.
""The express highway will be completed by December this year. Once completed, one can travel to Mumbai in around 5-6 hours from Madhya Pradesh, which will help in business development,"" he added.
The construction of a 687-km highway between Indore and Hyderabad costing around Rs 18,000 crore will be completed by 2025, the Union minister said and shared details of other projects in MP.
After constructing a greenfield highway for Rs 5,000 crore between Agra and Gwalior, the distance from Gwalior to Delhi will be covered in four hours, Gadkari added.
He appealed to the chief minister to sort out the environmental and land issues that cropped up regarding the alignment of the Chambal expressway.

Out of the 848 delayed projects, 202 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 200 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 323 projects for 25-60 months, and 123 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 848 delayed projects stood at 36.59 months.
Reasons for time overrun, as reported by various project implementing agencies, include delay in land acquisition, in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delays in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

Ayodhya bypass
project in Uttar Pradesh was planned and implemented under the
PM GatiShakti
initiative, the commerce and industry ministry said on Friday. It said that the project would facilitate uninterrupted freight flows and decongest Ayodhya.

Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
It ""will cover key districts such as Lucknow, Basti, and Gonda. This project will facilitate improvement in connectivity to economic, social and logistics nodes, including tourist and pilgrim sites, across these three districts,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Ayodhya is situated between two economic hubs (Lucknow and Gorakhpur) and major commodities such as leather, engineering goods, building materials, iron and steel, pass through the city therefore the construction of this bypass route will facilitate uninterrupted freight flows and decongest the city.
An idol of the new Ram Lalla was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on January 22, a landmark event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who also gave a clarion call to go beyond the grand mandir's construction to build the foundation of a ""strong, capable and divine"" India of the next 1,000 years.
The Ayodhya bypass project was evaluated during a meeting of NPG (national planning group), which was set up under the initiative.

The inter-ministerial NPG meets every fortnight and appraises
infra projects
to ensure multi-modality, synchronisation of efforts, and comprehensive development in and around the project location.
The initiative was launched to develop an integrated infrastructure to reduce logistics costs. All logistics and connectivity infrastructure projects, entailing investments of over Rs 500 crore are routed through the NPG.
The NPG's approval is required before clearance of the project by the Public Investment Board (PIB) or Department of Expenditure under the finance ministry.
The maximum projects recommended so far by the group are related to roads, railways and urban development.

Budget 2024: Higher capex for infrastructure likely with green focus,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/budget-2024-higher-capex-for-infrastructure-likely-with-green-focus/articleshow/107155249.cms,26-01-2024,"The upcoming
interim budget
is likely to see higher capital expenditure on
infrastructure
, in line with the past three years, with a focus on green investment to meet the demand for earlier committed projects, and give a push to growth, create jobs, attract private investments and offset the impact of global uncertainty, said experts.
""The interim
budget
is a working document and I don't expect a great radical shift in policy. This means that the government will continue to maximise public expenditure on infrastructure, both core and social,"" said Vinayak Chatterjee, founder, The Infravision Foundation.
He said the government needs to continue higher spending on infrastructure if it aspires for gross capital formation on infrastructure to be 8-9% of GDP.
According to the Confederation of Indian Industry, rationalisation of subsidies, revenue augmentation and simplification of taxes could allow the government to increase the capex by 20% to ₹12 lakh crore.

""While this will be a moderation from growth in the last two years, it compares well with 12% growth in the pre-pandemic period (2015-16 to 2019-20),"" it said. The PM GatiShakti plan is also expected to remain in focus. The government has evaluated more than 300 central and state projects worth ₹11.58 lakh crore in two years since the launch of the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity.
""While the government is expected to continue with capex on infrastructure, with a major chunk going to roads and railways, I foresee asset monetisation substantially enhancing the funding for new projects, especially roads,"" said Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, global head-transport, mobility and logistics at CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics.
According to Padmanabhan, the ability to take market risks and the willingness of the banks to fund infrastructure projects are the key challenges ahead.
""India is at an important inflexion point and given the current global developments and associated headwinds, the government should continue to lay major thrust on public capex (on physical, social and digital infrastructure) in the forthcoming budget,"" said the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The government provided a budgetary allocation of ₹10 lakh crore in 2023-24, ₹7.5 lakh crore in 2022-23 and₹ 5.54 lakh crore in 2021-22. India aims to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025.

View: India urbanisation critical for getting developed tag,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/view-india-urbanisation-critical-for-getting-developed-tag/articleshow/107155247.cms,26-01-2024,"India is urbanising rapidly. By 2036, its towns and cities will be home to 600 million people, or 40 % of the population, up from 31 % in 2011, with urban areas contributing almost 70 % to GDP. How well India manages this
urban transformation
will play a critical role in realizing its ambition of becoming a developed country by 2047, the 100th year of Independence.
Indeed, building the necessary
infrastructure
will be key for creating livable, climate-resilient, and inclusive cities that drive the economy forward. Since nearly 70 % of the urban infrastructure needed by 2047 is yet to be built, sizeable investments will be required. By 2036, India will need to invest $840 billion in infrastructure - an average of $55 billion or 1.2 % of GDP per annum. However, estimates suggest that between 2011 and 2018, the country's total capital expenditure on urban infrastructure averaged only 0.6 % of GDP, half the required quantum of investment.
Clearly,
private financing
will need to play a significant role. Yet, while more than 160 Indian cities have been classified as investment grade, reliance on government funding remains high. Central and state governments finance 72 % of urban infrastructure, with
commercial financing
providing a meagre 5 %. Recognising these challenges, the government has taken measures to enable commercial financing, but its use remains extremely limited, even in financially strong cities. To tap into private capital, urban local bodies (ULB) will need to comprehensively build their capacity and focus on executing bankable projects. It will also be important for the country to develop the municipal bond market and introduce innovative financing structures.
To increase the productive potential of citizens, cities will also need to invest in public services to improve their quality of life. Building human capital by improving access to health care and upgrading skills - with the private sector playing an important role - is a critical component of India's urban transformation agenda.
Providing efficient public transportation is another factor that adds to people's productive potential. Chennai, for instance, is addressing institutional fragmentation in the transportation sector by taking a holistic approach and establishing a nodal body to oversee, coordinate, and monitor traffic and transportation in the city. Ensuring that transportation is safe and accessible for women can also help bring more women into the work force, a key opportunity for development. World Bank calculations suggest that over the next 10 years, India can probably add 1.2 percentage points per year to potential growth if female labour force participation gradually increases from the current 31.6 % to more than 50 %. Given that India is a water-stressed country, creating the infrastructure needed for water security is just as imperative. Surat, for instance, has become one of the first cities to recycle wastewater at scale. And Dharampuri - a small town in Madhya Pradesh - has become water surplus by developing an integrated approach to water supply, linking every household to the sewerage system, and recycling wastewater. Other cities too can learn from their example.
Live Events
The World Bank stands ready to work with the Government of India, urban local bodies and citizens to fulfil their vision of
livable cities
for all.

Nitin Gadkari
said the government will develop 200 ropeway projects at a cost of Rs 1.25 lakh crore in coming five years under the National Ropeways Development Programme, “Parvatmala Pariyojana”.
Addressing a ‘Ropeway: Symposium-Cum-Exhibition’on Tuesday, Gadkari called for developing ropeways as part of the urban rapid transport system to decongest our cities and reduce pollution as well as the travel time.
“Our foremost priority should be to make ropeways economically viable by bringing down the overall project cost and encourage public private partnership to develop the ropeway network in the country,” he said.
Apart from facilitating tourism in the hilly areas, the ropeway offers huge potential in the urban public transport as well, Gadkari said.
“The government will provide 60% construction support under hybrid annuity mode (HAM for Ropeways) as compared to 40% support provided under national highways to attract more private players for development of ropeways under
Parvatmala Pariyojana
,” he said, adding while states will provide the land for development of ropeways, there will be no environmental clearance needed for such projects.

Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme launched in 2023, aims comprehensive development of select villages in 46 blocks in 19 districts of abutting northern border in Arunachal Pradesh along with Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Ladakh.
The programme envisages focused areas of interventions in the select villages for creation of opportunities for livelihood generation through promotion of tourism and cultural heritage, skill development and entrepreneurship and development of cooperative societies including agriculture/horticulture, cultivation of medicinal plants/herbs etc. the interventions also include providing road connectivity to unconnected villages, housing and village infrastructures, energy including renewable energy, television and telecom connectivity.
“And recently Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has sanctioned about 1022 kms of roads under the programme for Arunachal Pradesh. We are thankful to the Modi government that Arunachal Pradesh has the most number of border villages listed under the programme,” Khandu said.
Hailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remodelling the concept of border villages, Khandu said that Gelling, which was known as the last village on the Indian side in Tuting sub-division, today has become the ‘first village’ on the Indian side.
He said under the present central and state governments connectivity sector in the state has witnessed a sea change. Be it roads, air, rail or digital, he said all modes of connectivity has significantly improved in the last 7-8 years.
Khandu revealed that for accelerated growth of the state, his government has chalked out a blueprint to overhaul the existing planning process, which he assured will be put to implementation after the elections.
“The new planning process will extensively involve stakeholders at the ground level as it is the people in villages and officers on ground who actually know what is required. So our state plan will stand on the inputs from the ground. The entire process will be from bottom to top, not like the erstwhile top to bottom process,” he said.
Khandu assured that the new model of planning will accelerate holistic development of all villages in the state and that government resources will be optimally utilized without wastage.
Later in the day Khandu reached Yingkiong, the district headquarters and on arrival inaugurated several developmental projects that include upgradation of road from Aalo-Yingkiong BRTF road to Dite-Dime to Migging BRTF road, a new CHC building and EAC office at Jengging, cement concrete pavement Nubo road, a micro hydel station (2x25kw) at Man and a micro hydel station (1x30kw) at Palling.

has identified 53
road projects
worth Rs 2.1 lakh crore to be awarded on a
build-operate-transfer
model, an official statement said on Wednesday. Out of the total 53 projects for a length of 5,200 km, bids for seven highways with a length of 387 km worth Rs 27,000 crore have been invited, it added.
The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) will come out with a modified build-operate-transfer (
BOT
) project document in the next one month to attract private companies for investments in the
highways sector
, the statement said.
At present, projects are being awarded on
engineering, procurement and construction
(EPC) or hybrid annuity (HAM) mode due to various challenges in the implementation of BOT projects.
BOT projects provide the risk of financing, building and operating highway projects with a concession period of 20-30 years.
The proposed changes include modifications in the concession period based on actual traffic (PCU) against tolling groups of vehicles, re-visiting of actual traffic exceeding design capacity, and compensation for delays on the part of the authority.

""NHAI is making efforts to fast-track clearances and make the entire system transparent and time-bound to make BOT projects attractive,"" road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said at a conference on BOT projects on Wednesday.
Gadkari asked concessionaires to improve the quality of road construction and reduce the cost of the projects viable.
""We want to give a renewed push to BOT projects and have urged banks to liberalise financing to the road infrastructure sector,"" Gadkari added.
Also, speaking at the event, NHAI chairman SK Yadav said the idea behind the modified BOT project document is to eliminate discrepancies and make BOT projects attractive.

Minister Gadkari urged concessionaires to improve the quality of road construction, reduce the cost of construction by adopting better and latest technologies as it will make the projects viable.
""The idea is to eliminate discrepancies and make BOT projects attractive,"" NHAI chairman SK Yadav said, adding the amendments to the model concession agreement will be finalised by end of this month.
At present, projects are being awarded on engineering
procurement
construction (EPC) or hybrid annuity
mode
(HAM) due to various challenges in implementation of BOT projects.
The government has taken many initiatives in the past for revival of BOT projects including schemes like harmonious substitution, one time fund infusion, rationalized compensation, premium deferment and allowing refinancing.
The ministry has already invited bids for seven projects with a length of 387 km worth Rs 27,000 crore under BOT.
As per the government's 'Vision 2047’, a large number of high-speed corridors are being developed and the government feels that a robust public private partnership will play a pivotal role in realizing this vision and will greatly contribute towards the development as well as operation and maintenance of a world class national highway network in the country.

"Indian ports log double-digit growth in 10 years, PM Modi says, pledging to build mega ones",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/indian-ports-log-double-digit-growth-in-10-years-pm-modi-says-pledging-to-build-mega-ones/articleshow/106927670.cms,17-01-2024,"Prime Minister
Narendra
Modi
on Wednesday said Indian ports have achieved double-digit annual growth in the past 10 years and beaten many developed nations in ship turnaround time.
Earlier, ships had to wait long hours at ports and unloading took very long. ""Today, the situation has changed,"" the PM said after inaugurating three major
infrastructure
projects worth over Rs 4,000s crore in Kochi.
The projects included a new dry dock and international ship repair facility and International Ship Repair Facility (ISRF) at Cochin Shipyard, and
LPG Import Terminal
of
Indian Oil
Corporation. These projects, an official statement said, are in line with the PM's vision to transform India's ports,
shipping
, and waterways sector, and build capacity and self-sufficiency in it.
The PM pledged to build mega ports, shipbuilding and ship-repairing infrastructure in the country. He recalled the role of ports in India’s erstwhile prosperity in earlier times and envisaged a similar role for ports now when India is taking new strides and becoming a major centre of global trade. He listed an increase in
port
capacity, investment in port infrastructure, and improved connectivity of ports under the Sagarmala Project.
“The world is recognizing India’s potential and position in global trade”, Modi said, shedding light on the agreements made during India’s G20 Presidency regarding the Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor. The Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor will further strengthen the creation of Viksit Bharat by giving a boost to the coastal economy of India.

Modi said the new dry dock was the national pride of India. This will not only enable big vessels to dock but also make shipbuilding and ship repair work possible here, reducing dependence on foreign countries and will also save foreign exchange.
The ship repair facility, the PM said, would transform Kochi into India and Asia’s largest ship repair centre. Drawing the analogy of multiple MSMEs coming together in the manufacturing of INS Vikrant, he expressed confidence in the creation of a new ecosystem of MSMEs with the inauguration of such huge shipbuilding and repair facilities.
The new LPG Import Terminal will meet the LPG needs of Kochi, Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Calicut, Madurai, and Trichy while also supporting industries, other economic development activities and creation of new jobs in these areas, the PM added.
The PM highlighted the reforms made in the ports, shipping and waterways sector in the last 10 years and said that it has brought new investments in India’s ports and created new employment opportunities. The reforms in rules related to Indian Seafarers had led to an increase in the number of seafarers in the country by 140%. Within the country, the PM added that passenger and cargo transport got a major boost by making use of inland waterways.

Narendra Modi
as a centrepiece of his government's infrastructure drive.
Modi's five-year, $1 trillion infrastructure push across the country, a key part of his pitch for a third term ahead of this year's general election, aims both to boost jobs and to keep up with China and other modernising economies.
It also reflects a stronger public financing position for the world's fastest-growing major economy, which is paring its
fiscal deficit
even as it increases capital investments, although some analysts see potential risks if it cannot also draw more investment from the private sector.
""For years, the lack of modern infrastructure was a real barrier in our development,"" Modi said in a speech late last year.
""Today, the world's largest infrastructure building drive is under way in India.""

RK Jain, who owns three industrial components factories in the Navi Mumbai area south and east of the city centre, says the
Atal Setu bridge
and other infrastructure - including a new airport and light rail line - will help to turn the region from a ""backward area"" into a ""premium suburb"".
""That will be a game changer,"" he said.
The $2.2 billion bridge, under construction since 2016, will cut travel time between central Mumbai and the rapidly developing areas of Navi Mumbai - home to one of India's biggest ports as well as new hospitals and universities and global retail chains like IKEA - to 20 minutes from two hours, said Sanjay Mukherjee, head of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority.
Brokerage firm Jefferies estimated that the Mumbai metro area, India's financial nerve centre and home to 23.6 million people, would complete $10 billion in projects over the 18 months to end-2024, and an additional $60 billion over the next three to seven years.
Across India, the public and private sectors combined will invest Rs 96 lakh crore ($1.16 trillion) on infrastructure from 2024-2030, nearly double the total from the previous seven years, according to research firm CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics.
While industrial infrastructure has often been the focus of India's previous campaigns, the Modi government is targeting more projects directed at the broader public, including a Rs 1 lakh crore bullet train and utilities such as electricity, water and gas, said Vinayak Chatterjee, infrastructure analyst and founder of the Infravision Foundation, a think-tank.
""What we've seen in the Modi era is a business-to-consumer approach to infrastructure, which is infrastructure reaching the household of the common man,"" he said.
India has added more than 50,000 km of national highways since Modi came to power in 2014, government figures show, and now has 150,000 km nationwide. China has more than double that, however, with 382,000 km at end-2021.
New Delhi this year is allocating 22% of the federal budget to expenditures on infrastructure projects, up from 17% last year, and local governments have also boosted spending.
But the private sector, including local financial institutions, remains reluctant to invest in or lend to large projects after infrastructure investments that followed the global financial crisis soured due to implementation delays.
Infravision Foundation's Chatterjee said this reliance on public expenditure was not sustainable.
Indeed, India's relatively high debt-to-GDP ratio, above 80%, has long been cited as a risk to its sovereign credit ratings by ratings agencies.
The CRISIL report also highlighted the importance of wider financial support for a sustained infrastructure push.
""With international developers still some way from actively investing in infrastructure projects in India, impetus is needed to boost the involvement of pension funds and other institutions,"" it said.

"Govt to build 6,000 km of electric vehicle-ready highways on Golden Quadrilateral",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/govt-to-build-6000-km-of-electric-vehicle-ready-highways-on-golden-quadrilateral/articleshow/106681034.cms,10-01-2024,"New Delhi: The government is working on a plan to build electric vehicle-ready
highways
on the Golden Quadrilateral in a major effort towards reducing
fuel consumption
and
vehicular emissions
through electrification of intercity public transport. People in the know told ET that the Centre is looking to develop 6,000 km of these highways.
This is planned over the next seven years to accelerate the adoption of
e-mobility
and support the deployment of e-buses across the country. These
e-highways
would be powered with green energy-enabled charging infrastructure.
The programme is being envisaged as part of the proposed Vision 2030: PM Public Transport Sewa.
""The development of electric highways is likely to happen simultaneously with induction of
electric buses
accelerating the establishment of an ecosystem for EVs in India,"" said one of the persons cited above.
The government has initiated talks with stakeholders to replace 800,000 old, polluting diesel buses with electric ones by 2030. This includes 200,000 electric buses for state transport undertakings, 550,000 for private operators and 50,000 for schools and employee transportation.
Live Events
The new e-highways are expected to catalyse the development of charging infrastructure, spurring more people to buy electric cars for everyday commutes. Sales of electric cars last year stood at 83,000 units, shy of the targeted 100,000 mark, as first-time buyers kept away from electric as the only option for their choice of vehicle. Consumers are sceptical of the range and the inadequate charging infrastructure for EVs in the country, making them opt for such vehicles only as a second or third personal mode of transport.
The Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) is the longest highway network in the country connecting the four metros of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai - and along with them several industrial, agricultural and cultural hubs. The North-South Corridor connecting Srinagar (in Jammu & Kashmir) and Kanyakumari (in Tamil Nadu) and the East-West Corridor connecting Silchar (in Assam) to Porbandar (in Gujarat) are additional projects. The development of e-highways on the GQ is likely to give a significant boost to the government's aim to reduce logistics costs and at the same time, curb emissions in line with COP28 guidelines.
Confirming the plans to build e-highways, a senior government official said on condition of anonymity, ""The government's focus is to convert roads into electric highways to help substantially reduce logistic costs and bring down pollution levels in the country by switching to green mobility.""
Electric highways are an energy-efficient option where the roadway provides electricity to moving vehicles mostly through overhead power lines. Currently, the world's longest e-highway spanning 109 km is operational in Berlin, Germany.
According to the official, the ministry of
road transport
& highways plans to award electrified highways on build, operate, and transfer (BOT) model to private companies. Work is also on to identify and convert existing highways into e-highways by setting up enough charging stations for electric buses to ply between cities, thus giving a boost to cost-effective green intercity public transport. Under this, the cost will be borne by the Centre and states.
In September last year, minister for road, transport & highways
Nitin Gadkari
had said the government is looking at developing electric highways as it is economically viable and is considering various technologies for implementation. The power ministry could provide electricity at subsidised rates, the minister had said, adding private investors could construct electric lines on identified routes and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) can implement an electric tariff system, similar to the tolls payable currently on highways.

Vision 2047: Mega plan for building highways soon,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/vision-2047-mega-plan-for-building-highways-soon/articleshow/106617338.cms,07-01-2024,"India could soon roll out a new mega
highways
construction programme, in line with Narendra Modi-led NDA government
vision 2047
, replacing
Bharatmala
Pariyojana to enhance connectivity in the country. The proposed programme will clearly spell out parameters for eligibility criterion of roads to be identified as a national priority coupled with changes in Model Concession Agreement for expeditious infrastructure creation and minimising contract disputes and litigation. ""Future projects will be awarded under a new scheme. It will be different from Bharatmala,"" a senior government official told ET.
Contract changes in the works
Besides the change in approach, tweaks in Model Concession Agreement (MCA) for all road building contracts are being readied to minimise contract disputes and litigation. ""We have studied court cases where government lost out to contractors. Provisions that were found to be unfavourable for government and driving unnecessary litigation will be plugged. The law will be tightened for better project implementation and ensuring better quality roads,"" a third official said.
According to a proposal under consideration, there shall be no arbitration for a dispute involving a claim value up to ₹50 lakh. Further, for cases involving higher amounts, neither government nor concessionaire shall be entitled for any pre-reference or pendentelite interest. In addition to this, it has also been suggested that insurance during the concession period (to compensate in cases of project failure) should also include the government arms as joint beneficiaries.
Bharatmala progress
According to official data, the country has been annually constructing over 10,000 kilometres of
national highways
(NH) since the launch of Bharatmala in October 2017. The goal of the scheme was to build 74,942 kilometres (km) of NH, of which 34,800 km was approved as the first phase for development (till September 2022) against ₹5.35 lakh crore investment. Further, contracts for 27,384 km of highways have been awarded under Bharatmala and the constructed length stands at 15,045 km. While the scheme successfully drove the country into a faster pace of highway construction, there have been concerns around escalated expenditure.
Live Events
BOT approach
It is now expected that any remaining NH contracts awarded this fiscal will be under the Build Operate Transfer (BOT) model which entail negligible financial outgo from the exchequer. ""The Centre is giving an impetus to BOT projects about 11 stretches aggregating to ₹22,000 crore have been put up for bids,"" said Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, Senior Director - Transport logistics and Mobility - CRISIL Ltd.
Sector watchers say these BOT projects will help achieve the goal of awarding 10,000 kms of NH in the current fiscal.

Jain also said that the government has asked companies to prepare detailed project reports (DPR) for unawarded identified projects to increase the pace of awarding in 2023-24.
He said the total length of four-lanes and above national highways (
NHs
) increased by 2.5 times to 46,179 km in December 2023 from 18,387 km in 2014.
While the total length of high-speed corridors in 2014 was 353 km, which increased to 3,913 km in 2023, the total length of less than 2-lane national highways decreased from 30 per cent (2014) to 10 per cent of national highway network in 2023.
Jain also said the road ministry has constructed 6,217 km of national highways up to December in 2023-24.
He noted that expenditure on the ministry's highways construction expenditure is expected to increase by 9.4 times to Rs 3.17 lakh crore in 2023 from 2014.

Transhipment port: Govt says 11 players have expressed interest in the project in Great Nicobar Island,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/govt-says-11-players-have-expressed-interest-in-transhipment-port-project-in-great-nicobar-island/articleshow/106516724.cms,03-01-2024,"NEW DELHI: The government has received
expressions of interest
(EOIs) from 11 players for the Rs 41,000-crore international
transhipment port project
at
Great Nicobar Island
in the Bay of Bengal, Union minister
Sarbananda Sonowal
said on Wednesday. Last year, the
Ministry of Ports
,
Shipping
and Waterways in a statement said the project is expected to be completed with an investment of Rs 41,000 crore (USD 5 billion), including investment from both government and public-private partnership (
PPP
) concessionaires.
""11 players have submitted expressions of interest for the international
transhipment port
project at Great Nicobar Island,"" the ports, shipping and waterways minister said.
The EOI was sought on January 28, 2022.
The proposed port in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands will have the ultimate capacity to handle 16 million containers per year, and in the first phase, to be commissioned by 2028 at a cost of Rs 18,000 crore, it will handle more than 4 million containers.
Other projects planned around the transhipment port include an airport, a township and a power plant.
Live Events
The project is located on the international trade route, with existing transhipment terminals like Singapore, Klang and Colombo in proximity.
The project focuses on three key drivers, which can result in making it a leading container transhipment port -- strategic location in terms of proximity (40 nautical miles) with the international shipping trade route, availability of natural water depth of over 20m and carrying capacity of transhipment cargo from all the ports in the proximity, including Indian ports, as per the statement.
The proposed facility is envisaged to be developed in four phases.
The estimated cost for Phase 1 of the proposed transhipment port is around Rs 18,000 crore, which includes the construction of breakwaters, dredging, reclamation, berths, storage areas, building and utilities, procurement and installation of equipment and development of the port colony, with core infrastructure going to be developed with the government support.
Public-private partnership (PPP) will be encouraged for this project via landlord mode. The PPP concessionaire will have the flexibility to develop a storage area, container handling equipment and other infrastructure based on the concessionaire's own market and business assessment, subject to the minimum guaranteed traffic.
The concessionaire would be awarded a long-term PPP concession of 30 to 50 years (based on requirement), will be responsible for the provision(s) of port services and shall have the rights to levy, collect and retain charges from port users.
Currently, nearly 75 per cent of India's transhipped cargo is handled at ports outside India.
Colombo, Singapore and Klang handle more than 85 per cent of this cargo, with more than half of it handled at Colombo port.

Narendra Modi
, on Wednesday, gave its go ahead to construction of a bridge on Bihar and widening of a road in Tripura entailing an investment of over Rs 5500 crore.
“The CCEA gave its approval for the construction of new 4556 m long, 6-lane high level and extra dosed cable stayed bridge across river Ganga (parallel to western side of existing
Digha-Sonepur rail-cum road bridge
) and its approaches on both sides in the districts of Patna and Saran (NH-139W) in Bihar on EPC mode,” it said, adding that the total cost for the project is Rs 3,064.45 crore which includes civil construction cost of Rs 2,233.81 crore.
Besides, the also gave its approval for improvement and widening to two lane with paved shoulder of 134.91 km road from Khowai to Harina on NH-208 in Tripura.
“The project involves investment of Rs 2,486.78 crore which includes a loan component of Rs 1,511.70 crore,” it said, adding that the loan assistant will be from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under the official development assistance (ODA) scheme.
“The project is envisaged to facilitate better road connectivity between various parts of Tripura and to provide alternative access to Assam and Meghalaya from Tripura apart from existing NH-8,” it said.
Live Events
The construction period for the project stretches will be two years and will also include maintenance of these national highways stretches for five years (in the case of flexible pavement) and 10 years (in the case of rigid pavement) after completion of construction.
According to the statement, the road project in Tripura has been selected based on the necessity of providing smooth and motorable roads after considering socio economic needs of the region.
“Development of the project stretch of NH-208 would not only improve Interstate connectivity between Assam and Tripura via NH-208A but also reduce the transit time and provide safer connectivity for the travellers,”, it said, adding that since the project stretch also passes very close to Bangladesh border, it would improve connectivity to Bangladesh through Kailashahar, Kamalpur and Khowai Border Check Post.
“The land border trade would also potentially grow with the improvement in road network in the region through development of the project road besides improved connectivity to agricultural belt, tourist places, religious places and tribal districts of the state, which are backward in terms of growth and income,” it said, adding improved connectivity will help to generate more revenue to the state as well as income for local public.

Out of the 845 delayed projects, 204 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 198 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 322 projects for 25-60 months, and 121 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 845 delayed projects is 36.64 months.
Reasons for time overrun, as reported by various project implementing agencies, include delay in land acquisition, in obtaining forest and environment clearances and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delays in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to Covid-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

No tolled highway with full capital cost recovery: Nitin Gadkari,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/no-tolled-highway-with-full-capital-cost-recovery-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/106189998.cms,21-12-2023,"New Delhi: The government on Thursday said there are no tolled
national highways
in the country that have completely recovered the capital cost. In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Union Road Transport and Highways Minister
Nitin Gadkari
said there is no provision for closing of user fee plaza after completion of concession period/recovery of capital cost as per the
National Highways Fee
(Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008.
""There are no tolled national highways (Public/ Private funded) in the country of which capital cost has been completely recovered,"" he said.

plans to bid out projects worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 2 lakh crore on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model before the model code of conduct comes into effect while moving to a
GPS-based toll
collection by March next year, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said. The general elections are likely to be held in April-May 2024.
The move is aimed at reducing
traffic congestion
and charging motorists for the exact distance travelled on the highways, Gadkari said at the annual conference of the Highways Operators Association of India (HOAI) on Wednesday.
“The government is looking at new technologies including GPS-based toll systems to replace
toll plazas
in the country...We will start new GPS -satellite based toll collection across the country by March next year,” he said.
During 2018-19, the average waiting time for vehicles at toll plaza was eight minutes. With the introduction of FASTags during 2020-21 and 2021-22, the average waiting time of the vehicles has come down to 47 seconds.
Talking on the shift from engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) to BOT model, Gadkari said the government will bid out road projects worth Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh crore on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for highway projects less than 1000 km before the model code of conduct comes into effect.

“Going forward, we will favour the Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) model mostly for highway construction,” he said. InvITs are instruments on the pattern of mutual funds, designed to pool money from investors and invest in assets that will provide cash flows over a period of time.
Gadkari also said the ministry of road transport and highways has conducted two pilot projects of automatic number plate recognition systems (automatic number plate reader cameras) to enable automated toll collection without stopping the vehicles.

Union Transport Minister aims for India's road infrastructure to match US in next 5 years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/union-transport-minister-aims-for-indias-road-infrastructure-to-match-us-in-next-5-years/articleshow/106149599.cms,20-12-2023,"India
aims to elevate its road infrastructure to match that of the US within the next five years, said Minister of Road Transport and Highways,
Nitin Gadkari
. As part of a comprehensive strategy, the government seeks to alleviate metro congestion, significantly reduce travel time, and minimise road accidents, he said.
In the preceding nine years, his ministry has allocated projects exceeding Rs 50 lakh crore and has streamlined the contract approval process by refining existing policies. ""No contractor needs to come to me for sanctioning the contract. We are transparent, time- bound, result-oriented and quality conscious and fast in decision-making. We consider the ministry, contractors and bankers as one family.
""We encourage good work, and that is why we have seven world records. This is the great achievement of the ministry,"" he said in an interview published in the Manorama Yearbook 2024. ""I am confident that after five years, our road infrastructure will be equal to the US,"" he said.
The minister stressed that futuristic development of infrastructure is the need of the country. India needs robust infrastructure for attracting capital investment from both domestic and foreign sources, which would remove poverty and generate employment. Dwelling on the country's automobile sector, he said India's automobile industry had recently surpassed Japan to become the third behind China and USA. ""Our industry is worth Rs 7.5 lakh crore and the maximum GST to the states and central government is generated from this sector. Till now, 4.5 crore jobs have been created by this industry. My dream is to double the size of our automobile industry to Rs 15 lakh crore in the next five years.

""This is the way in which we are progressing in every sector. We are already the fastest growing economy and people are more interested in dealing with India,"" the minister is quoted as saying in a release issued by the Manorama on Wednesday. He also strongly pitched for introducing electric and flex fuel vehicles to reduce consumption of fossil fuel, whose import bill is Rs 16 lakh crore. Some vehicles, with flex engines, are now being powered by ethanol instead of petrol. It will bring the average cost of fuel to Rs 15 as ethanol's rate is only Rs 60 and it would also generate electricity.
""We are now opening ethanol pumps."" Gadkari further said it would also empower Indian farmers to double up as 'urjadaata' (energy producer) while being 'anndaata' (food producer) as ethanol fuel can be produced from crops like sugarcane and rice stalk. ""The diversification of agriculture to energy and power sector is the most important policy which is going to change the future of our country, particularly of rural agriculture and tribal India. Like smart cities, we can have smart villages which is very important for the development of our country and that is the policy change we are bringing in,"" he said.
As for the future of public transportation, he said India is now making ropeways, cable cars and running public transport on electricity. Efforts are underway to introduce electric buses in more cities. ""Within five years public transport will totally change. It will be a less polluting, more cost-effective substitute,"" he noted. For decongesting metros, projects have been undertaken to the tune of over Rs 65,000 crore, which include Dwarka Expressway (Rs 9,000 cr), six-lane urban extension road in the National Capital (Rs 8,000 cr), Eastern Peripheral Expressway (Rs 12,000 cr), and Delhi-Meerut Expressway (Rs 8,000 crore).
In support of his ministry's efforts to ensure faster travel time, he cited the instance of Atal Tunnel at Rohtang Pass between

Similarly, Katra-Delhi Expressway will allow travel between Delhi and Amritsar in four hours, Delhi and Katra (J&K) in six hours and Delhi and Srinagar in eight hours. In Ladakh, the work has started on the biggest tunnel in Asia at Zojila Pass. He also disclosed that new border roads are being built which are strategically important. There are 30 roads where airplanes can safely land. Plans are afoot to develop 670 roadside amenities which will also have heliports and drone ports. Gadkari highlighted the vital role of entrepreneurs and startups in revitalising the Indian economy.
""We need to support those who have entrepreneurship and possess new technology,"" he added. The minister, however, conceded that his promise to reduce accidents by 50 per cent has not yielded desired results. Every year five lakh accidents and 1.50 lakh deaths occur which result in a GDP loss of three per cent. ""This is a problem related to automobile engineering, road engineering and awareness of the people. People don't have respect for the law,"" he said, adding that it is imperative to change the mindset of the people about road safety for which help is needed from media, social and educational institutions, and NGOs.

“Of these 152 projects, 41 are Mega Projects costing Rs 1000 crore and above,” the report noted.
The government tracks projects with a value of Rs 150 crore and above. Of the 1,831 projects, 421 projects faced cost overruns, leading to the overall anticipated cost of all projects (Rs 29.51 lakh crore) monitored on the portal exceeding the original cost by Rs 4.4 lakh crore.
Among the delayed projects, 52% were delayed for over two years, with 14% delayed for over half a decade.
The government counts delays in land acquisition, environmental clearances, lack of infrastructure support & linkages, and tie-ups for project financing as significant reasons for delays.
Railways
accounted for the most delayed projects, with some delayed for nearly 20 years.
The Uddhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla project was first commissioned in 1995 and is due for completion in February 2024. Besides Railways, some power, coal and atomic energy projects were delayed for nearly a decade.
Water resources and railways also accounted for a higher share of cost overruns than other sectors, with anticipated costs across all projects exceeding the original cost by 197% and 52.2%, respectively. Road transport and highways, which accounts for 56% of total projects monitored, had less than 20% of its projects facing cost overruns. The ratio of
cost overrun
was also much lower, with anticipated costs exceeding the original cost by 5.2%.

ET first reported in October on NIIF's plans to sell the assets and hiring JP Morgan as the banker.
Mails sent to NIIF, CPPIB, VINCI, Abertis, KKR, Edelweiss did not elicit any responses till the press time, while a CDPQ spokesperson declined to comment.
The operational road projects are held under Athaang Infrastructure - sponsored by NIIF's Master Fund. Earlier, NIIF had planned to raise $500 million (₹4,000 crore) from both global and domestic investors through a road InvIT. However, the plan was called off and decided to sell the assets.
""This is the largest road portfolio available in the market, and spread across the country,"" said an executive with one of the funds which is interested in the deal.
Major assets within this portfolio include two highways situated in Jammu & Kashmir - the 16.3-kilometre Qazigund Banihal Expressway, and the 64.5-kilometre Jammu Udhampur Highway.
The other roads in South India owned by Athaang are Devanahalli Tollway which connects Bengaluru city to its airport and Telengana's Dichpally Tollway - an important link between two key industrial hubs, Hyderabad and Nagpur.
A major portion of the traffic plying on the Devanahalli Tollway project stretch is airport bound. Post the recovery in FY22 and FY23, the annual average daily traffic PCUs on the project stretch grew to 87,606 in 1HFY24 from 75,096 in FY23. The daily average toll collection grew to ₹81 lakh in 1HFY24, aided by increased toll rate aided by inflation and growth in traffic, said a November report by India Ratings and Research.

CDPQ is in talks through its infrastructure trust, Indian Highway Concessions Trust.
In 2021, Ashoka Concessions and Galaxy Investments II, an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR), had signed an agreement for the sale of five BOT toll subsidiaries - Ashoka Highways (Bhandara), Ashoka Highways (Durg), Ashoka Belgaum Dharwad Tollway, Ashoka Sambalpur Baragarh Tollway and Ashoka Dhankuni Kharagpur Tollway for an aggregate consideration of Rs 1,337 crore. However, the agreement was terminated in May.
Ashoka Buildcon holds 66% stake in Ashoka Concessions, with SBI Macquarie holding the rest. SBI Macquarie had invested Rs 800 crore in Ashoka Concessions in 2012 through Macquarie-SBI Infrastructure Fund. Once the deal is materialised, SBI Macquarie will get an exit, receiving about ₹1,200 crore, according to the people cited earlier.
Earlier, the Indian government-backed NIIF had signed agreements to acquire Ashoka Concessions' stake in two road projects - Jaora Nayagaon Toll Road Company in Madhya Pradesh, and Chennai Outer Ring Road.
In 2022-23, toll projects recorded a year-on-year growth of 22% in collection to ₹1,117 crore from ₹918 crore in the previous fiscal. Toll collections are expected to increase to more than ₹1,200 crore this year, on the back of a modest increase in toll rates and moderate traffic growth, according to a recent report by
Icra
.
Actis, the London-based investor in sustainable infrastructure, had acquired a portfolio of six operating highway toll road projects - five hybrid annuity model (HAM) properties and one BOT road last year from
Welspun Enterprises
for an aggregate EV of ₹6,000 crore.
In August, Actis' road investment arm, Actis Roadstar Highways Holdings, acquired four HAM road assets, including two operational roads, from Patel Infrastructure.
Maple Highways, CDPQ's platform for the roads sector in India, is the sponsor of Indian Highway Concession Trust, which houses two assets - NCR Eastern Peripheral Expressway in the NCR, under ToT7, and Shree Jagannath Expressways in Odisha.

and lowered the export release time at land ports to 22 hours in 2022 from 101 hours in 2021.
At a meeting with World Bank officials this week, the government said it plans to add 30,000 km of additional railway tracks by FY31, increase port capacity to 2,200 mtpa by 2030 from 1,617 mtpa last year, and expand the
national highways
network to 185,000 km by 2030, of which 75,000 km would be four-lane and above.
The meeting was led by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade as part of India's aim to break into the top 25 countries in the World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI).
""We have showcased initiatives in logistics and infra sectors to the World Bank team, and also next-gen reforms in areas such as rail, road, multimodal shifts, EXIM, customs, green logistics,"" said Sumita Dawra, special secretary (logistics), DPIIT.
India improved its ranking by six places to 38 out of 139 countries on LPI 2023. The previous ranking was released in April. The railway ministry aims to lay 80,000 km of additional rail tracks in the next 25 years and increase rail containerization to 35% in 2031 from 30% now.

As per GatiShakti principles, the projects were discussed to promote multimodal connectivity to the manufacturing and commercial zones, while uplifting the socio-economic development of the region through improved logistics ecosystem.
Two
road projects
were also discussed with a combined road length of more than 300 kms. One project is in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, aiming to uplift the socio-economic conditions in tribal districts and a Left-Wing Extremism (LWE)- affected district. The road is expected to reduce the length of present travel by 11% (from 153.45 km to 136.62 km) and travel time by 56% (from 4.2 hours to 1.85 hours).
The second road project, situated in Assam and Mizoram, offers alternative connectivity route in the region, resulting in a 20% reduction in length (from 215 km to 172 km) and a 50% reduction in travel time (from 5 hours to 2.5 hours) over present connectivity. This road is poised to benefit industrial parks and the Bamboo Technology Park in the region.
Dawra underscored the significance of multi-modal connectivity during the meeting and highlighted their potential as a powerful tool for inclusive growth, especially in historically neglected areas, according to the statement.

Standing committee flags issue of delay in road projects; shortfall in NMP targets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/standing-committee-flags-issue-of-delay-in-road-projects-shortfall-in-nmp-targets/articleshow/105843201.cms,08-12-2023,"The parliamentary standing committee on transport, tourism and culture, headed by V Vijayasai, has pulled up the ministry of road transport and highways on shortfall in monetisation of assets and delay in projects due to issues related to land acquisition.
In its report, submitted in the Parliament, on Friday the department related committee noted that there is a persistent shortfall in achieving the targets fixed by the ministry in a financial year under the National Monetisation Pipeline.
“The committee recommends that the ministry should fix achievable targets and then strive hard and marshall all its resources to achieve the said targets,” it said.
Talking about measures to reduce road accidents, the committee suggested introduction of anti-sleep devices in automobiles that helps prevent accidents caused by drivers who fall asleep while driving.
“Further, there is a need to prioritize black spots based on the severity of accidents, traffic volume, and other relevant factors and the focus must be on the most critical locations first,” it added.

The committee has further suggested that the ministry should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of black spot eradication efforts, such as accident rate reduction and traffic flow improvements.
According to the report, the ministry of road transport and highways should coordinate with the ministry of animal husbandry and dairying to formulate a plan to prevent stray cattle and other animals from coming onto national highways as that leads to accidents.
Noting that the land acquisition is the main factor that comes in the way of timely completion of the project, the committee has recommended setting up a single window clearance/portal that includes all stakeholders involved in the process of land acquisition in the interest of making the process hassle-free and time-bound.
The committee also highlighted the issue of a large number of vacancies at the National Highways Authority of India. “Around 37% of posts are lying vacant. Shortage of manpower is adversely affecting the efficiency of the organisation,” it said, adding that a timeline may be fixed to fill the vacant posts at the earliest for better performance as also optimum utilisation of resources.

Bharatmala Pariyojana
Phase I (BPP-I) as on October 31, 2023, and the difference in actual project cost and normative cost is due to increase in cost of raw material and land acquisition, Parliament was informed on Wednesday. In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Union
Road Transport
and Highways Minister
Nitin Gadkari
said Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has made observation about the increase in cost of Phase I of the pariyojana.
""As on October 31, 2023, the total expenditure (BPP-I) is about Rs 4.10 lakh crore...There has been no diversion of funds from other schemes in the execution of BPP-I,"" he said.
According to Gadkari, certain BPP-I projects were earlier planned under other schemes of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRT&H) viz, externally aided project (EAP), National Highways Original works NH(O), and SARDP scheme, which were subsequently prioritized under BPP-I as per the network planning.
""The difference in actual project cost and normative cost under Bharatmala Pariyojana is due to increase in cost of raw material, increased land acquisition cost, construction of high speed corridors and increase in GST rates etc,"" he said.
In 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved BPP-I entailing development of 34,800 km of National Highway corridors with total outlay of Rs 5.35 lakh crore.

Cashless medical treatment for road accident victims in 3-4 months: Road Secretary,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/cashless-medical-treatment-for-road-accident-victims-in-3-4-months-road-secretary/articleshow/105725884.cms,04-12-2023,"The
Ministry of Roads Transport and Highways
(MoRTH) plans to introduce cashless medical treatment to all injured
road accident victims
across the nation within the next three to four months, road secretary Anurag Jain said.
“The free and cashless medical treatment to accident injured victims is part of the amended Motor vehicle Act 2019 (
MVA
, 2019). Some states have implemented it but now the ministry of roads in league with the ministry of health and family welfare will be fully implementing it across the nation,” he said on Monday.
“Such cashless treatment shall be extended to road accident victims including during golden hour, as defined by the MV Amendment Act,” Jain said while inaugurating a three-day “Global Road Safety Initiative” being organised by the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE) in partnership with the road ministry, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (
UNESCAP
) and the
United Nations Economic Commission
for Europe (UNECE).
Golden Hour is the one hour lasting an hour following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care.
According to Jain, India has the highest number of road accident deaths in the world. “Aiming to reduce accidents by 50% by 2030, the road ministry has formulated a multi-pronged strategy based on 5E’s of road safety. This includes education, engineering (both of roads and vehicles), enforcement and emergency care,” he said.

Himachal Pradesh
will be carried out by a third party and vertical drilling machines will be stationed near tunnels to be used in case an Uttarakhand-like situation arises, according to an NHAI official.
National Highway Authority of India
(NHAI) Regional Officer
Abdul Basit
on Friday said the safety audit will analyse all factors from rock stability to material used in the constructions and remedial steps would be taken as per suggestions in view of the Uttarkashi Silkyara tunnel incident in which 41 workers have been trapped for the past 13 days.
A total of 68 tunnels measuring 85 km, which would reduce the road distance by about 130 km, would come up in the state, he told PTI on Friday.
Of these, 12 have been constructed, 12 are under construction, work on 14 would start in six months while detailed project reports are being prepared for 30, he said.
""We have given suggestion to put vertical pipes at tunnel construction locations for supplying oxygen and food in case a similar tragedy strikes,"" he said.
The NHAI officials visited some under-construction tunnels and interacted with workers, directed contractors to have a list of machinery available in nearby areas so that in case of an emergency, these can be made available at the site without losing time.

Warning that no laxity in safety will be tolerated, he asked project directors to conduct mock drills and check the preparedness of evacuation plans.
In 2015, two of three labourers were trapped inside the under-construction tunnel (No. 4) of
Kiratpur-Nerchowk
four-lane project in Himachal's Bilaspur after a portion of the tunnel collapsed on September 12. They were rescued after nine days.
A tunnel about 1.2-metre diameter was dug vertically to reach the trapped persons and rescue them.

The Indian logistics sector has been undergoing a much-needed transformation with the impetus given to transportation infrastructure across the country. An important addition happened last month.
Indian Railways
achieved a significant milestone in its
Dedicated Freight Corridor
(
DFC
) project when the
Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor
(EDFC) was completed. The entire 1,337 kilometre length of the
EDFC
has now been declared operational after the successful trial run of the first freight train over the 401-kilometre long New Sahnewal (Punjab)–to-New Khurja (Uttar Pradesh) section of the EDFC.
This will allow seamless and cost-competitive
cargo movement
and an accurate travel time prediction for freight transports that will have a far-reaching impact on trade.
Moreover, the corridor would multiply the capacity in terms of carrying heavier loads and volumes, as it could operate 480 heavy-haul freight trains each day. Besides facilitating quicker cargo transit, it will also ease traffic on the current rail and road networks.

Boosting growth and efficiency
Projects like EDFC could prove a game-changer not only for the Indian Railways but also for the economy on the whole in the near future.
As per a
World Bank
report, DFCs will help India reduce its high logistics costs from some 13-15 per cent of the GDP and help it move towards the target of 8 per cent by bringing them more in line with global standards.
In addition, each kilometer-long freight train on the EDFC will replace some 72 trucks on average. This will ease congestion on India’s overcrowded roads and highways, which carry an overwhelming 60 per cent of the country’s freight.
Moreover, the move from diesel-operated trucks to electrified rail, together with the shift from older railway lines to the energy-efficient corridor, will reduce India’s fossil-fuel consumption and lower its carbon footprint, as the World Bank report highlighted.

The
coal corridor
Last year in April, acute coal shortages across the country triggered repetitive blackouts ranging from two hours to eight hours as many states struggled to meet the surging demand for electricity.
Simultaneously, factories also took a hit due to the power outage, and industry captains called for regulating electricity supplies. Apparently, the
coal supply
was hampered by the reduced availability of
railway rakes
, which led to coal inventories dipping to their lowest pre-summer levels in 2022 in at least nine years.
Meanwhile, international energy prices also shot up following the war in Ukraine, leading to a reduction in coal imports, and the problem exacerbated. The Centre frantically stepped up efforts to increase coal supplies to power plants and also asked the state governments to build up coal inventories for the next three years.
In the past, the Railways has to cancel passenger trains to make way for coal rains during acute shortages at thermal plants. The EDFC will connect a large part of North India to the coal mines in the eastern parts.
Things might change rapidly now, as far as coal supply is concerned. As per the official estimates, the coal transit time from the coalfields of Eastern India to the power plants of Northern India has been reduced by 30-40 per cent with the operationalisation of EDFC, ET has reported. This will further lead to a significant reduction in the inventory costs of power plants.
The east-to-north railway route brings coal from eastern coalfields to northern thermal power plants, but the line capacity has already been saturated due to the surge in passenger trains, which are given priority over freight trains. This leads to constant delays, but that could be a thing of the past now, as the EDFC would take most of the goods traffic from the busy Delhi-Howrah Grand Chord, helping to reduce congestion and increase the speed of passenger trains.
A study done by the Railway Board had emphasized the need to have dedicated coal corridors to meet the growing power demand in the country. The majority of the coal is transported from Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to the north, west and south-east of the country and there is a need to develop tracks exclusively for coal movement on these routes, said the report on estimation of coal transportation by rail by 2030.
India’s electricity consumption is expected to grow at an annual rate of 5.4% over the next decade, with annual demand touching 2,300 billion units by 2030, a study released last year by Arthur D. Little, a global management consulting firm, estimated.
Laggard no more
The 1,337-km EDFC will enable the freight trains to run at top speeds of 60-70 kmph, which will be a significant improvement as currently these trains run at 25-30 kmph or so. Though the corridor has been designed to achieve a maximum speed of 100 kmph for freight trains, that appears like a distant dream amidst the present state of affairs.
The arteries for multimodal hubs
Multi-modal logistics parks (MMLPs), which are being built to bring revolutionary improvements to India's freight logistics sector, are part of the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan, which was launched in 2021 to provide multimodal connectivity infrastructure to various economic zones. This master plan aims to enhance economic growth, infrastructure development, and the completion of projects in a time-bound manner, which is a big concern in India.
These multi-modal parks, the hubs that will connect various modes of transport, will be built at select locations along DFCs to lower logistics costs and increase freight modal share of railways. Several multi-modal logistic parks, including one on the riverfront at Varanasi at an estimated cost of Rs 5,000 crore, would be set up along the DFCs, spanning across the country to facilitate seamless movement of goods.
These parks will Improve the freight logistics sector, leading to lower overall freight costs and saving of time. It will have a cascading effect in terms of trimming warehousing costs, reducing vehicular congestion, and improving the tracking and traceability of consignments with the help of new technology.
These parks have been set up under the Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP), to serve as intermodal freight-handling facilities with the help of mechanized material handling provisions.
Intermodal connectivity with DFCs, expressways,and highways will allow the smooth movement of cargo. Moreover, multi-modal parks will also provide other value-added services such as packaging, tagging,and crating, under one roof to further reduce cost and save time.
The DFCs will serve as arteries for these multi-modal parks.
According to government estimates, these multi-modal parks could leverage the new opportunities thrown up by DFCs, and are expected to attract investment to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore.

cost overruns
of more than Rs 4.31 lakh crore in October this year, an
official report
said. According to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, which monitors
infrastructure projects
worth Rs 150 crore and above, out of 1,788 projects, 411 reported cost overruns and 837 projects were delayed.
""Total original cost of implementation of the 1,788 projects was Rs 24,78,446.60 crore, and their anticipated completion cost is likely to be Rs 29,09,526.63 crore, which reflects overall cost overruns of Rs 4,31,080.03 crore (17.39 per cent of original cost),"" the ministry's latest report for October 2023 said.
According to the report, the
expenditure
incurred on these projects till October 2023 was Rs 15,27,102.91 crore, which is 52.49 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects.
However, it stated that the number of
delayed projects
decreases to 628 if the delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion.
Further, it said that for 290 projects, neither the year of commissioning nor the tentative gestation period has been reported.
Live Events
Out of the 837 delayed projects, 202 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 188 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 324 projects for 25-60 months, and 123 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 837 delayed projects was 36.94 months.
Reasons for time overruns, as reported by various project implementing agencies, include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delays in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

Cost overruns decline below 18% mark for the first time in nearly four years: MoSPI report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/cost-overruns-decline-below-18-mark-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-four-years-mospi-report/articleshow/105287396.cms,17-11-2023,"The proportion of
cost overruns
in government infrastructure projects declined below the 18% mark for the first time in nearly four years, according to data released by the government.
While the proportion of cost overruns had risen to 19.2% in September, it fell to 17.4% in October. The number of projects running behind schedule declined to 46.8% from 47.7% last month.
The anticipated cost of projects at Rs 29.1 lakh crore was Rs 4.31 lakh crore higher than the original cost as of November 1, according to the cost analysis of 1,788 projects, with a value of Rs 150 crore and above, registered on the ministry’s portal.
“Out of the 1788 projects, 50 projects are ahead of schedule, 611 are on schedule, 837 are delayed, 411 projects reported cost overrun, and 259 projects reported both time and cost overrun with respect to their original project implementation schedules,” the government stated in its report.
Of the 837 delayed projects, 54% were delayed for over 25 months. While the pace of completion has been picking up, the average time overrun for projects has remained unchanged from the previous month at 36.94 months.
Live Events
The government completed 183 projects worth Rs 1.84 lakh crore until October. In 2022-23, 329 projects were completed with a total value of Rs 3.07 lakh crore.
Among ministries, water resources had the highest cost overruns with 41 projects exceeding the original cost by 197%, followed by
Railways
which faced 51.8% cost overrun. Roads, which accounts for over half of the total projects, had cost overruns of just 5.3%.
In terms of states, northeastern states had the highest cost overruns compared to the rest of the country.
The actual situation on the ground may reflect more cost overruns, the government stated in its release.
“It has also been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures may be underreported,” it said.

India
is undertaking the largest planned urbanisation programme in the world, Union minister
Hardeep Singh Puri
said on Thursday. The total investments for urban development since 2014 have risen 10 folds to more than Rs 18 lakh crore in comparison to the previous 10-year period, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said at the launch of CITIIS 2.0 -- the City Investments To Innovate, Integrate and Sustain challenge.
According to the ministry, the challenge is a significant step in the direction of achieving India's commitments to combating the challenges posed by climate change.
The minister also highlighted the central government's increased focus on the growth and development of urban areas in the country.
Speaking about the efforts towards achieving a circular economy in the country's urban areas, Puri said that under the
Swachh Bharat Mission
(SBM), the government has set up 112 biomethanation plants, 2,391 waste-to-compost plants, 55 waste-to-energy plants, 2,281 material recovery facilities, 972 construction and demolition waste management plants, and 335 solid and liquid resource management plants.
The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and its second phase have made transformational progress in making cities water-secure, he said, adding that SBM-Urban 2.0 will make cities garbage-free and remediate all legacy waste in the country.
Live Events
The country is now undertaking the world's largest planned urbanisation programme, he said and mentioned the 10-fold increase in the investment for urban development since 2014.
The BJP-led
National Democratic Alliance
(
NDA
) has been in power since 2014, while the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) ruled the country between 2004 and 2014.
In its statement, the ministry said that at the
UN Climate Change Conference
in Glasgow (COP26) in November 2021, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
presented India's five-point climate pledges - ""panchamrit"" - including achieving the target of net zero emissions by 2070.
Furthering this vision, the ministry has also undertaken various measures to address climate change through its ongoing missions, including the
Smart Cities Mission
, Swachh Bharat Mission and AMRUT.
CITIIS 2.0 envisages to supplement such climate initiatives through its unique model of action at all levels of government.

India a 'plus one location' as manufacturers decouple global supply chains: Rockwell Automation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/india-a-plus-one-location-as-manufacturers-decouple-global-supply-chains-rockwell-automation/articleshow/105226958.cms,15-11-2023,"Rockwell Automation
, the world's largest industrial automation firm, said India's made in India initiative and production linked incentive scheme (PLI) along with rapid acceleration in building capacity for roads, rails and tunnels has put the country's growth similar to
China
in the 1990s, a critical tipping point in its development.
""Starting from a small base, India is making a bet that manufacturing will be a key part of the GDP moving forward. And there's a similar acceleration happening that we saw in China in the 90s. And that's the curve India is on in terms of building the supplier infrastructure, the physical infrastructure like the roads, rails and tunnels, simplifying the taxation systems, and providing incentives for manufacturing to base it,"" Scott Wooldridge, president- Asia Pacific at Rockwell Automation told ET.
With an aim of decoupling of
supply
chains, companies world over are trying to build resilience and want an additional location beyond China and the US which will help diversification as well as de-risk operations amid future events including geo-political conflicts. And in most conversations Rockwell has with global manufacturers in the top two or three countries that are being discussed for global manufacturing, India figures as a plus one location, it said.
""We look at every country in terms of the ability to support manufacturing. And some of it comes down to labor costs. Some of it comes down to policy investments that might help us and we also look at ease of doing business. How long will it take us to get planning approval? How easy it is to construct a facility, how complex is the taxation and tariff laws. And in those three areas, India has made a dramatic step forward the last five years,"" added Wooldridge
For the Milwaukee-based Rockwell, India is the second biggest hub for innovation outside its home market and with nearly 4500 employees, the country is also the second largest employee base for the global firm that provides hardware and software technology that helps automate manufacturing processes. In fact, the employee count has doubled over the past four years, despite the pandemic when companies shifted focus on digital capabilities.

Dilip Sawhney, managing director at Rockwell Automation India said covid led to companies, even small and medium enterprises, adopting unprecedented manufacturing flexibility as it directly equated to competitive advantage.
""The pandemic created that burning platform moment, when the only way you could continue with your operations was by leveraging digital. The manufacturers that had been strategically investing into creating a more robust, integrated infrastructure across the enterprise, but across manufacturing, really, were able to take benefit out of it,"" added Sawhney.
The company has also been making strategic acquisitions in India, both on the innovation front as well as in the product design space. Earlier this year, it acquired Knowledge Lens, which deals in insights from enterprise data, combining digital technologies with deep data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and engineering expertise. In 2019, it had acquired Pune-based manufacturing technology consulting firm MESTECH Services
Rockwell said the buyouts were part of its strategy to leverage its support for global product development even as India has one of the largest concentrations of development capabilities. The company expects India to be among the top three players in manufacturing over the next five to 10 years.

Out of the 842 delayed projects, 194 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 190 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 323 projects for 25-60 months and 123 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 842 delayed projects is 36.94 months.
Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delay in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

IL&FS plans sale of some road assets as InvIT transfer faces hurdles,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/ilfs-plans-sale-of-some-road-assets-as-invit-transfer-faces-hurdles/articleshow/105020424.cms,06-11-2023,"The IL&FS group is considering selling a few of its road assets, as its board is facing challenges to transfer those to an infrastructure investment trust (
InvIT
) as planned.
IL&FS had plans to transfer around a dozen road assets to the InvIT, Roadstar Infra Investment Trust (RIIT). While it has already transferred five of the assets, the transfer of another five is delayed due to legal challenges by lenders and other issues. The process of transferring one asset is progressing, while it has excluded another from the process.
The board is now considering alternative methods to monetise these assets even as it is retaining the target of raising ₹61,000 crore as part of the group's debt resolution programme.
Meanwhile, IL&FS has decided to list RIIT, which has acquired five assets from IL&FS Transportation Networks. The assets transferred to RIIT are Moradabad Bareilly Expressway, Sikar Bikaner Highway, Hazaribagh Ranchi Expressway, Thiruvananthapuram Road Development Company and Pune Sholapur Road Development Company.
""The IL&FS board has decided to go ahead with listing the Roadstar Infra Investment Trust ... RIIT is also in the process of acquiring one more asset subject to requisite approvals,"" an IL&FS spokesperson said.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had given approval to IL&FS' plan to transfer its Phase 1 special purpose vehicles on September 15, 2021 and Phase 2 SPVs on October 14, 2022. Out of the SPVs, only five have been successfully transferred to the InvIT.
Among the other assets, IL&FS has decided to exclude East Hyderabad Expressway from the transfer to InvIT due to delays and the expiration of its concessions in December 2022.
IL&FS is exploring alternative resolution mechanisms for its other assets - Barwa Adda Expressway and Baleshwar Kharagpur Expressway. These SPVs are facing disputes with their lenders, delaying the restructuring of their debts.

India unlikely to have hyperloop trains in near future: NITI member V K Saraswat,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/india-unlikely-to-have-hyperloop-trains-in-near-future-niti-member-v-k-saraswat/articleshow/104981377.cms,05-11-2023,"India
is unlikely to go in for hyperloop technology for ultra high-speed trains in the near future as the technology is at a 'very low level' of maturity and may not be economically viable at the current juncture, NITI Aayog Member V K Saraswat said on Sunday. Saraswat, who is heading a committee to explore the technological and commercial viability of the
Virgin Hyperloop
technology, further said some foreign companies have shown interest to bring the technology in India.
""Hyperloop technology as far as we are concerned, we found that the offer which came from foreign countries are not very viable options. They are at a very low level of maturity of technology,"" he told PTI in an interview.
Hyperloop is a high-speed train, running in vacuum in a tube. The technology is proposed
Elon Musk
, who is behind electric car company
Tesla
and commercial space transport company SpaceX.
""So we have not given much importance to that and as on today, it is only a study programme. I don't expect hyperloop to enter into our transportation framework in the near future,"" he said.
The Virgin Hyperloop test run was conducted on November 9, 2020, on a 500-metre track in Las Vegas in the US with a pod, as the hyperloop vehicles are called, travelling with passengers, including an Indian, inside an enclosed tube at more than 161 km/hr.
Live Events
According to Saraswat, the offers which came are at a very low level of maturity and ""we can not make investment on that kind of a technology.""
Virgin Hyperloop is among a handful of companies which are trying to build such a system for passenger travel.
Maharashtra
has deemed hyperloop a public infrastructure exercise and approved the Virgin Hyperloop-DP World Consortium as the original project proponent for the Mumbai-Pune hyperloop project.
Replying to a question on India's reliance on lithium imports from China, Saraswat said as on today, production of lithium ion battery in India is very low, so the dependence is on the import of batteries from China and other sources.
""But mostly it is from China because competition wise the Chinese batteries are cheaper,"" he said.
Pointing out that India has given incentives for setting up battery manufacturing facilities in the country, Saraswat said,""Hopefully, next year you will have couple of business houses going into production in a large scale for manufacturing of lithium-ion battery in the country.""
About 75 per cent of the lithium-ion imports come from China.
On reports of India talking to Chile and Bolivia for tapping into lithium mining, Saraswat said there was a suggestion that India should go for acquisition of certain mining facilities in Chile, Argentina and other places.
""And what has happened is instead of the government directly going to these countries and acquiring mines , our private sector has already signed business to business agreement with some of the companies in these countries and they have already got supply chain agreement for getting lithium from these centres.""
Chile endowed with most lithium reserves, is the second largest global lithium producer.
To a query on the government promoting methanol as alternative fuel, Saraswat said,""we have been able to complete our trials of blending 15 per methanol in diesel.""
He said all the trials conducted with
Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation
(BMTC) and
Ashok Leyland
have been successful.

The minister said when he took charge as the road transport minister in 2014, the length of national highways was 986 kilometres and in 2023, it has increased to 1,478 kilometres.
Around 355 km of road construction, costing Rs 8,000 crore, has been completed in Mizoram after he took charge of the
Ministry of Road Transport
and Highways, he said.
Gadkari also said a 373-km road project between Aizawl and Tuipang in the southern part of the state would be completed by June next year.
The Rs 7,361-crore project to connect six districts of Mizoram, including Aizawl and Serchhip, will also link Myanmar and develop the economy, trade and create employment opportunities, he said.
The Centre will construct Aizawl bypass road at the cost of Rs 2,500 crore to solve traffic snarl in the state capital, he said, adding that the project, which covers a length of 35 km and 2.5 km of tunnel, is scheduled to be completed by December 2025.
He also claimed that the construction of the four-lane Silchar to Vairengte-Sairang road (NH-306) got delayed as the state government ""failed to provide land"" due to problems between the revenue and forest departments.
The Centre under the leadership of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
and the
BJP
with its president
JP Nadda
will ""transform Mizoram into one of the developed states in the country"" if the party is voted to power or becomes part of the next government in the state, he said.
""The BJP does not believe in discrimination on the basis of caste, creed and sex, and the
NDA
government at the Centre is committed to developing the country,"" he added.

Awarding of contracts
for
national highways
slowed down in the first half of the
current financial year
, even though the momentum picked up in September, according to a
SBICAPS
report.
New contracts
are expected to be awarded for construction of 10,500 kilometres
roads in the current fiscal
, which will be below the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways target, the report released on Thursday said.
A new Vision 2047 may replace
Bharatmala Phase 2
, bringing in a flurry of greenfield projects in the sector, which have higher capital intensity, it said.
According to the report, the award mix continues to be dominated by small players, but the recent recalibration of bidding norms has ensured that larger projects mainly go to listed developers.
While fastag revenues have shown a strong growth of 24 per cent year-on-year in the April-September period, high frequency indicators such as GST and fuel consumption indicate that FY24 will register record toll revenues of Rs 67,000 crore, the report stated.
The momentum would ease in FY25, the report said, adding that it is imperative to expedite monetisation efforts to channel future toll revenue for funding a new era of greenfield projects.

For irrigation projects, he advised that visits of stakeholders be organised where successful rehabilitation and reconstruction work has been done, the statement said.
The transformational impact of such projects may also be shown. This may motivate the stakeholders for the early execution of projects, it added.
During the interaction, he also reviewed 'Mobile Towers and 4G Coverage under USOF Projects'.
Under the Universal service obligation fund (USOF), 33,573 villages with 24,149 mobile towers are to be covered for saturation of mobile connectivity.
Modi asked officials to ensure setting up of mobile towers in all uncovered villages within this financial year with regular meetings with all stakeholders. This will ensure saturation of mobile coverage in the remotest of the areas.
Up to the 43rd edition of PRAGATI meetings, 348 projects having a total cost of Rs 17.36 lakh crore have been reviewed, the statement said.

Govt eyeing shift to BOT as private cos show interest in roads sector: Nitin Gadkari,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/govt-eyes-shift-to-bot-as-private-cos-show-interest-in-roads-sector/articleshow/104633084.cms,23-10-2023,"The government will bid out over ₹2 lakh crore worth of
road projects
on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model by March 2024, giving a renewed push to the public-private partnership in road construction, road transport and highways minister
Nitin Gadkari
has said. This shift from the existing emphasis on engineering, procurement, and contract (EPC) model will drive private players to build better quality roads because they have to maintain them for 15 years, Gadkari told Yogima Seth Sharma, Deepshikha Sikarwar and Vinay Pandey in an interview. Edited excerpts:
How has the highways sector performed in the current fiscal?
Our budgetary allocation for current fiscal is ₹2.7 lakh crore and we expect to use all of it. Our capex is on target. It was ₹49,000 crore around one-and-a-half month ago and must have touched ₹70,000 crore by now.
What is next on the agenda for the roads and highways sector? Private investment is still to kick in in a big way...
In the coming months till March 2024, we are looking to award ₹2 lakh crore worth of projects on build-operate-transfer (BOT) mode. We are restarting projects on BOT to encourage public-private partnership in road construction. Health of the sector has improved tremendously. We have also made several policy interventions and some more minor policy tweaks could be taken up to make it more attractive for the private sector to invest. There is no apprehension in the private sector and the number of private players in the sector has gone up from 5 to 40 now.
Our focus now is on changes in use of fuels and converting roads into electric highways with electric buses and trucks plying on them. This will significantly reduce the logistics cost by as much as 30% compared to diesel. India's fuel import bill currently stands at ₹16 lakh crore and will soon go up to ₹25 lakh crore with growth in our automobile industry. The idea is to significantly reduce India's fuel import dependence with increased adoption of alternate fuels, and also reduce pollution. We are also looking at replacing diesel construction equipment with alternate fuel ones, including methanol trucks. Besides, there are several other green initiatives lined up. We are attempting for carbon credits and have planted 3.88 crore trees so far and transplanted 78,000. We have successfully tested bamboo crash barriers and are now using fly ash in road construction in a big way. We have built 1,000 Amrit Sarovars and are now using rubber powder from waste tyres with bitumen along with steel slag and municipal waste in road construction.
Live Events
What is the need to shift to BOT mode of construction when the current framework of build and monetise is working well?
The roads that we make under the EPC mode have to be maintained by us. Even roads built under HAM (hybrid annuity model, which is a mix of EPC and BOT models) have to be maintained by us. On the other hand, under BOT, we will not have to maintain the roads for 15 years. Secondly, the private sector that builds the road and is responsible for maintaining it for 15 years builds good quality roads, which is not the case of roads built under EPC. Overall, BOT is going to be beneficial. Secondly, it will lead to job creation but in places where this is not economically viable, like in the Northeast, we will continue to do so with the budget.
Do you see reliance on the budget coming down as we shift to BOT, or will this level of government expenditure continue?
There is no dearth of funds with the government. We just successfully completed a project on liquid waste management in Mathura on HAM. India's growth surged four times and there is immense scope for private investment in roads, railways, solid and liquid waste management, and electric vehicles.
There has been a huge focus on monetisation of roads. How do you see this going forward?
We have got tremendous response to InVIT and TOT. InVIT was seven times oversubscribed in seven hours on the first day. Asset monetisation in our sector is going well though there are many speed breakers on the way.
How has the creation of GatiShakti played out on overall infrastructure development in the country?
GatiShakti has brought in the much-needed coordination between different departments and ministries. Earlier, different infrastructure ministries were working in silos. It is bringing about greater efficiency and cohesion in planning and execution.
You have been talking about alternate technologies and material used in road construction. Is there an estimate by how much the overall project cost comes down with these interventions?
The new techniques that we are using include municipal waste, rubber powder and plastic, among others. However, our problem is the rise in prices of steel and cement used in concreting. So, we are working towards creating alternatives to steel and cement and will continue to encourage alternate materials to reduce the use of steel and cement.
Surety bonds have not made much headway with investors. Where is the problem?
We are in talks with the finance ministry on this. We have simplified surety bonds to a great extent, and it will be more regularised in the coming two-three months. A new policy is being worked upon after several rounds of deliberations with stakeholders.
What is the thinking on the
Tesla
plan (to start manufacturing in India) and its demand for concessions?
We welcome Tesla to India. India is a big market with all types of vendors present here. If it manufactures locally in India, it will get concessions. But if you make it in China and want to sell in India, then there is no concession policy available.

The government’s monitoring portal considered 1,418 projects in September, of which 12 were added from the previous month. The government completed 46 projects in September.
The report notes that 268 projects were on schedule, whereas 242 faced cost and time overruns.
However, it highlights that this may not present the actual picture on the ground, as not all agencies may be reporting or providing list of milestones.
“The concerned administrative Ministry may like to review the projects in order to avoid further cost overrun, time overruns, to firm up milestones in case of milestone is not available, to firm up revised cost estimates and revised commissioning schedule if the same has been not revised and lapsed,” the report stated.
Railways was one of the ministries facing the highest cost overruns, with expected costs 68.1% higher than the original cost in 173 projects. The 41 projects of the water resources ministry faced 195.6% cost overruns, whereas roads, which accounted for nearly half of the total projects monitored under the system, had 4.3% cost overruns.
Among states, northeastern states had the highest cost overruns, followed by
Andhra Pradesh

In line with the Prime Minister's vision to transform regional connectivity in the country through the construction of new world-class transport infrastructure, the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project is being developed, said officials.
RRTS is a new rail-based, semi-high-speed, high-frequency commuter transit system. With a design speed of 180 Kmph, RRTS is a transformational, regional development initiative, which is designed to provide high-speed trains for intercity commuting every 15 minutes, which can go up to a frequency of every 5 minutes as per requirement.
It will provide safe, reliable and modern intercity commuting solutions in the country. In line with PM GatiShakti's National Master Plan, the RRTS network will have extensive multi-modal integration with Railway stations, Metro stations, Bus services etc.
Trains of the RRTS will be known as 'Namo Bharat', Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced on Thursday.
In April, the National Capital Region
Transport Corporation
(NCRTC), which is implementing India's first semi-high-speed regional rail service project, had named RRTS trains as 'RAPIDX'.
In a post on X in Hindi, the Union housing and urban affairs minister announced that RRTS trains will be known as 'Namo Bharat'.
""The priority corridor of RRTS project related to the aspirations of crores of people is ready to get on track. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will dedicate it to the nation on October 20. The Regional Rapid Transit System of the country will be known as 'Namo Bharat',"" he said.
The Indian Railways is already running semi-high-speed trains -- 'Vande Bharat' -- in different parts of the country.

NIIF looks to sell over $1 billion worth of maiden roads portfolio,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/niif-looks-to-sell-over-1-billion-worth-of-maiden-roads-portfolio/articleshow/104536058.cms,19-10-2023,"MUMBAI: India's sovereign-backed National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (
NIIF
) is looking to sell its maiden portfolio of five
road projects
, worth around Rs 10,000 crore ($1.2 billion) on an enterprise value basis, sources aware of the development told ET.
NIIF has appointed investment bank
JP Morgan
to run a sale process for the roads portfolio, the sources said. Formal conversations are yet to begin, added the sources mentioned above on the condition of anonymity as these discussions are still in private domain. “This is one of the biggest road portfolios, value wise, to hit the market in recent times.” said one of the sources cited above. These operating road assets are housed under Athaang Infrastructure, a company sponsored by NIIF’s Master Fund. Athaang holds five assets with a total road length of over 230 kilometres spread across north and south India.
The key among these are two highways in Jammu and Kashmir acquired separately by the fund in 2022. The 16.3-kilometre
Qazigund Banihal Expressway
was acquired from
Navayuga Engineering
in July 2022 for $380 million (Rs 3,163 crore). Meanwhile, the 64.5-kilometre
Jammu Udhampur Highway
was acquired by Athaang in August 2022 from
Shapoorji Pallonji Group
for $290 million (Rs 2,414 crore).
The two projects are amongst the largest annuity projects awarded by the National Highways Authority of India. The fund operates the 73-kilometre Kashi Tollway in Uttar Pradesh that connects Prayagraj and Varanasi, which it won under the toll-operate-transfer (TOT) monetisation programme of NHAI for a value of Rs 3,144 crore in January 2023.

39 per cent capital cities in India have no active master plan: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/39-per-cent-capital-cities-in-india-have-no-active-master-plan-report/articleshow/104506081.cms,17-10-2023,"At least 39 per cent of India's capital cities do not have an
active master plan
, according to a survey conducted by Bengaluru-based think tank
Janaagraha
. The
Annual Survey of India's City-System 2023
also states that mayors and councillors only have limited role in key municipal functions.
The survey report, released on Tuesday by Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister
Hardeep Singh Puri
here, says 17 per cent of cities have a mayoral tenure of less than five years, adding that a tenure of less than five years makes the position of the mayor largely ""ceremonial and inconsequential"".
As per the report, mayors and councillors in India remain disempowered due to highly restricted devolution of functions and powers over funds and functionaries, short tenures in office and a policy of rotational reservations mandated by 74th
Constitutional Amendment Act
according to which reserved seats are allotted by rotation to different wards in the city.
""This has resulted in our city governments being practically reduced to one other civic service delivery agency rather than a city government or a local self-government,"" the survey states.
""Robust plan preparation is fundamental in improving the quality of infrastructure and services for residents and avoiding urban sprawl. However, at least 39 per cent of the capital cities in India do not have active spatial plans,"" it reveals.
Live Events
The report includes the study of 82 municipal legislations, and 44 town and country planning acts, among others.
It also says that no state in India provides an effective system to prevent the approval of projects that are not in conformity with spatial development plans (SDPs).
Additionally, there are no robust provisions by law to monitor ongoing projects for possible violations, the survey states.
""A vibrant SDP needs to be the product of a carefully structured process of discussion to outline a collective vision for the city. However, there is an absence of formal platforms for citizen participation in planning for our cities,"" it states.
After releasing the report, Union minister Puri said the
Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban
has brought about a pan-India behavioural shift towards cleanliness.
Solid waste processing has gone up from 17 per cent in 2014 to 76% today, he said and expressed confidence of achieving 100 per cent waste processing in coming years.

India to spend nearly Rs 143 lakh crore on infrastructure between FY24 and FY30: Crisil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/india-to-spend-nearly-rs-143-lakh-crore-on-infrastructure-between-fy24-and-fy30-crisil/articleshow/104496269.cms,17-10-2023,"India will spend nearly Rs 143 lakh crore on
infrastructure
between fiscals 2024 and 2030, more than twice the Rs 67 lakh crore spent in the past seven financial years starting 2017, rating agency
Crisil
said on Tuesday. Of the total, Rs 36.6 lakh crore will be green investments, marking a five times rise compared with the amount spent during fiscals 2017-2023, it added.
""India's
infrastructure spending
will double to Rs 143 lakh crore between fiscals 2024 and 2030, compared with 2017-2023,"" Crisil said in its Infrastructure Yearbook 2023.
Crisil Ltd
managing director and CEO Amish Mehta said the agency expects India's gross domestic product to grow at an average 6.7 per cent through fiscal 2031 to be the fastest-expanding large economy.
""Per capita income is seen rising from USD 2,500 now to USD 4,500 by fiscal 2031, creating a middle-income country,"" he said, adding that this growth will be underpinned by massive all-round infrastructure development, with sharp focus on integrating sustainability.""
While releasing 'CRISIL Infrastructure Yearbook 2023', which includes a unique national index CRISIL InfraInvex, Mehta said policy interventions and a conducive investment climate have aided the uptrend in the CRISIL InfraInvex scores across sectors.

""Four of these -- roads and highways, power transmission, renewable energy and ports -- have an overall score of 7-plus (out of 10), which underscores the pace of reforms and developments of the past few years,"" he added.
The rating agency noted that the next phase of infrastructure development will be marked by growth in the average ticket size of projects and a significant number of mega-scale projects.
Appropriate and consistent policy and regulatory interventions and focus on timely execution build an attractive case for various stakeholders to accelerate investments across infrastructure sectors, Crisil said.
The rating agency predicted that prominent sectors such as roads and power are expected to remain major contributors, while relatively nascent ones such as EVs, solar, wind, and hydrogen will pick up pace.
""The share of EVs in India's overall automobile sales is likely to reach 30 per cent by 2030.
""Two-wheeler EV sales are expected to outpace other segments up to 2028, while demand for EV buses will be driven by state transport undertakings,"" it said.
According to Crisil, favourable total cost of ownership and total cost of acquisition, as well as model availability for two- and three-wheelers will support EV offtake in coming years.
It said the share of renewable energy in total capacity is estimated to grow 4x between fiscals 2023 and 2030.
While solar will account for half of the incremental non-fossil generation, Crisil said there is a growing need to leverage emerging technologies such as 'floatovoltaics' (floating solar), offshore wind technology and green hydrogen.
Noting that the hydrogen sector is poised to attract substantial investments, estimated at Rs 1.5 lakh crore between fiscals 2024 and 2030, the rating agency said mandates for green hydrogen use and incentive schemes will be important here considering the cost of production of green hydrogen is twice that of fossil-based hydrogen.
Crisil said India's first sovereign green bond issuance will pave the way for the development of the domestic bond market for green issuances.
Over the past few years, global experience has shown increasing appetite for green assets among investors, leading to Indian companies seeking funds in global markets, it added.

"Need to rate DPRs, contractors for quality construction: Nitin Gadkari",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/need-to-rate-dprs-contractors-for-quality-construction-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/104492753.cms,17-10-2023,"The National Highways Authority of India (
NHAI
) is facing difficulties in the preparation of detailed project reports, as companies concerned are not ready to accept new technology, union minister for road transport and highways
Nitin Gadkari
said, calling for a need to rate DPRs and contractors to ensure quality infrastructure is created in the country.
According to Gadkari, big players in the steel and cement industry are indulging in cartelisation to jack-up prices. “The steel industry and cement industry, whenever they get the chance, they make the cartel and increase the rate,” he said on Tuesday while addressing the 4th CRISIL India Infrastructure Conclave 2023.
“The preparation of DPRs is a big problem for NHAI. There is no perfect
DPR
anywhere in any project,”
Gadkari
said, adding that financial audit, technological audit and performance audit are very important.
“While making DPR, they (companies engaged in DPR making) are not ready to accept new technology, new innovation, new research and even the standard of DPRs are so low that everywhere (there is) additional scope of work,” he said.

Investment projection in next seven fiscals
Energy
Rs 39.1 lakh crore
Road
Rs 37.3 lakh crore
Railways
Rs 25.6 lakh crore
According to Gadkari, the number of contractors in the country have gone up from 50 to 600 now and some of them quote prices below 30-40%. “As a practice we award contracts to the lowest bidder. There is a need to build equilibrium between cost and quality of
construction
,” he said.
Gadkari said his government is planning to make precast mandatory for building and
road construction
with some common designs to reduce cost and protect ecology.
Commenting on India’s expenditure on infrastructure creation, CRISIL said that infrastructure spend will double in the next seven years. According to a CRISL presentation, maximum contribution is expected in roads at Rs 37.3 lakh crore and energy with Rs 39.1 lakh crore projections.
“There will be Rs 143 lakh crore of infrastructure spending during fiscals 2023-24 to 2029-30,” CRISIL said while adding that despite private sector participation is key, CRISIL expects the centre to continue heavy lifting.
Highlighting the challenge, CRISIL noted that long-term funding requirements with potential risk for financial institutions need to be addressed. It also said that there is a need to give tax incentives for investments in green bonds.

These efforts will provide residents in the surrounding areas of Ahmedabad with high-quality urban infrastructure and services.
Additionally, the project will support the enhancement of 10 junctions along the existing Sardar Patel Ring Road to bolster connectivity between peri-urban areas and Ahmedabad city.
Peri-urban areas often experience the highest population growth rates due to industrial expansion and the influx of workers who may lack access to fundamental urban services.
The project aims to improve urban services and urban governance, benefiting the urban poor, women, and migrant workers.
ADB's role extends to enhancing the capacity of the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority and urban local bodies in technology-based urban planning.
This includes the development of climate change and disaster-resilient infrastructure that integrates environmental and social safeguards, gender equality, and social inclusion.
The project will also facilitate land development plans and town planning schemes that incorporate these elements, with the potential for replication in other states to encourage more structured urban development and densification through agglomeration.
Furthermore, the project will enhance the government agencies' capabilities in financial planning, revenue enhancement, and infrastructure asset operations.
Community awareness programs will be initiated to promote water conservation, health, and hygiene.
Women's self-help groups will receive training in water supply operations. Additionally, the project will support the development of recycling treated sewage for industrial purposes through public-private partnerships.
The ADB remains dedicated to fostering prosperity, inclusivity, resilience, and sustainability across Asia and the Pacific, while persistently working to eradicate extreme poverty.
This initiative underscores the organization's commitment to furthering these goals and improving the living conditions of those residing in peri-urban areas near Ahmedabad.

Israel-Hamas conflict may pose hurdles to IMEEC timelines: GTRI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/israel-hamas-conflict-may-pose-hurdles-to-imeec-timelines-gtri/articleshow/104419947.cms,14-10-2023,"The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict may lead to delays and complications in the
India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor
project, according to think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (
GTRI
). It said while the conflict's immediate consequences are confined to Israel and Gaza, its ripple effects throughout the Middle East cannot be underestimated.
GTRI said the conflict could derail the prospect of a historic peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a crucial linchpin in the
India
Middle East Europe
Economic Corridor
(
IMEEC
) framework.
Although Saudi Arabia and Israel have historically maintained no formal diplomatic ties, recent years have witnessed signs of a thaw, with negotiations underway for normalisation, GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said, adding that the war may derail any progress made.
""The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict may disrupt the project's timelines and outcomes, marking a pivotal juncture in the development of this ambitious economic corridor. While the war's direct impact remains regional, the geopolitical consequences reverberate far beyond, with potential consequences for the proposed corridor,"" he added.
IMEEC, a proposed economic corridor, aims to boost economic development by fostering connectivity and economic integration between Asia, the Persian Gulf, and Europe.

The envisioned corridor would span from India to Europe, passing through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and Greece.
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for this was signed during the G20 summit in New Delhi last month, with participation from governments such as India, the US, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, and the European Union.
The project's key goal is to enhance transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia, and it is often viewed as the response to China's Belt and Road Initiative.
Srivastava added that the disruption in the Middle East, a vital link in this corridor, may lead to delays and complications in the project's execution.

"Rs 51,000-crore Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) completed",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/rs-51000-crore-eastern-dedicated-freight-corridor-edfc-completed/articleshow/104406034.cms,13-10-2023,"The entire 1337 kilometre (km) length of the Rs 51,000-crore
Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor
(EDFC) was declared operational on Friday. This was possible after the successful trail run of the first
freight train
over the 401-kilometre long New Sahnewal (Punjab) – to New Khurja (
Uttar Pradesh
) section of the
EDFC
.
The first commercial service on this route is scheduled for November 1. Its counterpart, the 1046 km long Western DFC connecting Khurja to Jawaharlal Nehru Port (Maharashtra) is estimated to cost Rs 72,000 crore when complete during the next fiscal. “More than 95% of the total DFC will be completed by March 2024,” a statement from Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (
DFCCIL
) said while adding that the entire corridor is ‘at an
advanced stage of completion
.’
“At present, 2383 km (83.8%) of a total length of 2843 km has been commissioned,” DFCCIL said.
With this, the total cost of DFC has touched Rs 1.24 lakh crore, significantly higher than the Rs 82,000 crore initial sanctioned cost. Responding to a query on the inflated cost, the senior DFCCIL official said, “Land acquisition cost alone has risen to Rs 20,000 crore, up from initial estimates of Rs 8,000 crore.”
According to official estimates, the coal transit time from the coalfields of Eastern India to the power plants of Northern India has been reduced by 30-40% with the operationalization of EDFC. This is leading to a significant reduction in the inventory costs of power plants.

"Spending so much on highways and trains, but is it helping people? Govt wants to know",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/spending-so-much-on-highways-and-trains-but-is-it-helping-people-govt-wants-to-know/articleshow/104335321.cms,11-10-2023,"The
finance ministry
has proposed that the railways, road transport, and shipping ministries should conduct
productivity tests
for their completed projects. Similar assessments should also be carried out for Metro Rail projects. This continuous exercise will enable the government to evaluate the impact of these projects on the economy and people's lives, considering the significant investment in creating infrastructure. The finance ministry has also requested the
Niti Aayog
to monitor the data generated by these tests and provide recommendations in consultation with the relevant ministries, a TOI report by Dipak K Dash stated.
During the evaluation of the high budget allocation for railways, which is set to increase from Rs 45,232 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 2.4 lakh crore in 2023-24, the issue of freight transportation came up. The finance ministry has asked the Niti Aayog to conduct a study to assess the optimal share of different modes of transportation for freight and develop a plan to rationalize it. Currently, road transport carries around 65 per cent of the freight, while rail accounts for approximately 20 per cent, despite the higher cost of transportation by road compared to rail and waterways. The railway ministry aims to increase its modal share to 40 per cent by 2030 as part of efforts to reduce logistics costs from the current 16 per cent of GDP to the global average of 8 per cent by 2030.
To facilitate the execution of projects related to multi-modal connectivity among the road transport, railway, and shipping ministries, the finance ministry has urged the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (
DPIIT
) under the commerce ministry to establish an institutional arrangement mechanism. The
National Logistics Policy
(NLP) also aims to promote the smooth movement of goods by developing multi-modal transport networks. The finance ministry has emphasized the need for collaborative planning of railway stations, ports, roads, waterways, and airports to ensure seamless freight movement.
The DPIIT recently announced that over 300 projects worth Rs 11.6 lakh crore, initiated by ministries and state government departments, have been evaluated using the 'national master plan' for integrated planning.

On the Road ministry's asset monetisation plan, Jain said state-owned National Highways Authority of India's (NHAI) road monetisation pace has not slowed down and The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) will also achieve its asset monetisation target.
""We have identified road projects for monetisation under viz toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model, Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) model. You will see a lot of activity happening this year,"" he said.
InvIT is an instrument on the pattern of mutual funds, designed to pool money from investors and invest in assets that will provide cash flows over a period of time.
MoRTH is making an effort to achieve a target of more than Rs 40,000 crore through various modes of asset monetisation and by raising resources through Special Purpose Vehicle in this financial year.
Asked why build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects have taken a backseat, Jain said when the Modi government assumed office for the first time in May 2014, there were lots of stalled projects, so a lot of hard work was done to resolve those issues.
""Now that environment is once again back, where we can look at some good BOT projects... We hope this year, we will be able to come up with good BOT projects also,"" he said.
Responding to a question on
National Vehicle Scrappage Policy
, Jain said that there are challenges, however, the policy has started receiving positive responses from states and other stakeholders.
""Around 36 vehicle scrapping centres have been put in place across 13 states. Another 34 centres are under construction, while another 27 are under approval stage,"" he informed.
He noted that the pace of setting up of Automated Testing Centres needs to be expedited. ""There are some states where there are gaps, so we are pursuing those states also,"" he said, adding that there is a need to work more on registered automated testing stations for transport vehicles.
The Vehicle Scrapping Policy was introduced for the first time in August 2021, focuses on phasing out old and unfit vehicles to reduce vehicular pollution.
The policy aims to de-register private cars that are aged more than 20 years and commercial vehicles aged more than 15 years.

India may aim to monetise $24 bn worth of highways by 2027,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/government-aiming-to-monetize-24-bln-worth-of-highways-by-2027-careedge-ratings/articleshow/104037617.cms,29-09-2023,"The
Indian government
plans to generate revenue of approximately two trillion rupees (equivalent to $24.1 billion) by monetising
highways
in the coming years, said rating agency CareEdge.
According to the agency’s report, the
National Highways Authority of India
is expected to build approximately 4,000 to 4,500 kilometers (equivalent to 2,796.2 miles) of new roads annually in the next three years, and the government can generate revenue from these assets using an
Infrastructure Investment Trust
(InvIT) or a toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model.
The government’s current plan, which is based on a public-private partnership model, has been successful as 88% of road projects awarded prior to March 2020 are now operational and can be monetised. Only 12% of projects awarded in the pre-2020 period are delayed due to weaknesses of their operators, the rating agency said.
88% of road projects awarded before March 2020 have successfully achieved operational status. It is worth noting that 12% of these projects have encountered delays, and a significant proportion, i.e 75% of the delayed projects belonged to weak sponsors, said the agency.
“While strong sponsors are expected to benefit from healthy balance sheet indicators, providing them with financial flexibility, moderate sponsors with a substantial under-construction portfolio and stricter sanction terms face amplified financing risks,” said Maulesh Desai, director at
CareEdge Ratings

National Highways to be pothole free by December this year: Nitin Gadkari,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/national-highways-to-be-pothole-free-by-december-this-year-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/104014174.cms,28-09-2023,"The government will soon firm up a roadmap to make India’s national highways
pothole free
by December 2023 with construction focus shifting from the engineering, procurement and construction (EPF) model to build-operate-transfer (
BOT
) model and the hybrid annuity model (HAM) for government projects under the ministry of road transport and highways.
“Under BOT mode, the maintenance of the highways lies with the contractor and hence good quality roads are made which minimises their maintenance cost,” road transport minister
Nitin Gadkari
said on Thursday.
According to Gadkari, a policy is being made to ensure potholes free
national highways
and young engineers will be roped in to make the project a success.
Gadkari was addressing the media on more than a dozen initiatives that his ministry has undertaken over the years to reduce India’s carbon footprint and dependence on fossil fuels.
A senior government official said it has been a conscious decision to now move from EPC model to BOT and HAM model for all projects above Rs 500 crore while continuing with EPC model for construction of smaller patches of roads.

The ministry of road transport and highways has done the mapping of the entire national highway length of 1,46,000 crore and is firming up performance-based maintenance and short-term maintenance contracts to remove potholes by December this year.
Gadkari further said his ministry is working on a separate policy for use of municipal waste in road construction. The government’s policy will have an enabling provision to promote use of municipal waste in embankment construction.
“We are working on a feasible model which will focus on incentivising creation of waste segregation facilities,” he said.
According to Gadkari, his ministry has firmed up a draft policy that will promote use of alternative fuel in construction equipment to reduce cost and dependence on fossil fuels. The ministry is in talks with the finance ministry for approval.
“Incentives like interest subvention schemes can be worked out so that concessionaires or contractors can invest in construction equipment running on alternate fuels instead of fossil fuels,” the minister said.
The minister further said that the
transport ministry
has taken several initiatives to decarbonise the sector including evaluation of various technologies to develop electric highways between Delhi and Jaipur where electric traction will be used to run electric buses in the same manner as is done for railways.

The NPG's approval is required before clearance of the project by the
Public Investment Board
(PIB) or Department of Expenditure under the finance ministry.
The maximum number of projects recommended by the group are related to roads, railways and urban development.
The NMP has a number of layers of geospatial data showing all physical and social infrastructure of an area and land records in one place. It has been designed for faster planning and better design so that the impact of an investment is maximised.
The NPG has representations from various connectivity infrastructure ministries/ departments involving their heads of network planning division for unified planning and integration of the proposals.
All these departments approach the NPG first for approval before making a DPR (Detailed Project Report) at the planning stage. After the NPG's clearance, the project follows the normal procedure of approval by the finance ministry and the Cabinet.
Over 1,400 layers of data, including those related to land, ports, forests, and highways, are available on the portal.
Usage of the portal by different ministries, including social sector departments and states, is increasing and it is helping in the proper planning of projects, it said.

""All these facilities - Metro and electric buses, these have to be economically viable. I believe that economically viable schemes will have good service delivery and the citizens will be happy with it. There will be no problem,"" Puri said in Indore.
Attacking Opposition, Puri said that the philosophy of some political parties is that all such services should be made free.
""Some political parties believe in making such things free, but these are capital-intensive schemes. Like
Vande Bharat trains

Nitin Gadkari
, Union
Transport Minister
, 8th Edition of ET Now Infra Focus Summit & Awards.
ET Now: Let's talk about the infra scene...
Nitin Gadkari:
The dream of our Prime Minister is to make India a $5 trillion economy and for that reason, the most important thing the country needs is infrastructure development.
Without water, power, transport and communication, we will not get industry and capital investment. Without industry and capital investment, we cannot create employment potential. And without employment potential, we cannot eradicate poverty. That is very important.
The most important thing which I feel related to is the G20 Alliance for Biofuel. That is to be a great achievement. Presently, we have the technology. We are making ethanol from sugarcane juice, molasses, B-molasses, C-molasses, ethanol from corn, ethanol from food grain, ethanol from rice, wheat. We are making ethanol from bamboo. And now in Panipat, we are making ethanol from rice straw.
Now Indian Oil is going to start making not only ethanol, but also bio-bitumen. At the same time, they are making bio-aviation fuel. I am confident that in due course of time, we will have a technology where we will convert carbon dioxide into ethanol. That would be a great thing for the country.

I want to ask you a personal question. You remember so many statistics — it is at the tip of your tongue. Sir, what do you eat in the morning?
If I tell you the truth. I study a lot. I study a lot. I was a mediocre student. I have told you many times that I was disqualified for admission to engineering college because at that time (1975), I was working against the emergency. I got 52% mark in the HSE exam and in science group 49.26%. But a professional college requires 50%.
Actually, a person who holds ownership for his work remembers each and everything.
One of the prime programmes of your government is
PM Gati Shakti
. What exactly is your ministry's involvement in the PM Gati Shakti?
In this country, you have seen many times that on one side a railway bridge is being built and on the other side a road bridge is being built. On one side a road tunnel is being built and on the other side a railway tunnel is being built.
The problem is that the government runs in a silo. This department does not talk to that department; that department does not talk to this department. If both of them get a chance to talk to each other, they will say, I will talk to my department and he will talk to his department. This is very common.
We have players here who must have confidence...
This is how it is taught to each other. So we need to establish cooperation, coordination and communication between the stakeholders.
Secondly, we are building a road. Here is a big port. We will put priority on building a road. We have collected 850 such points.

Further, it stated that for 339 projects, neither the year of commissioning nor the tentative gestation period has been reported.
Out of the 830 delayed projects, 194 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 190 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 323 projects for 25-60 months and 123 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 830 delayed projects is 36.96 months.
Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delay in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

Repayment worries: Lenders' debt recast plan for MEP Infra hinges on a green light at the toll booth,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/repayment-worries-lenders-debt-recast-plan-for-mep-infra-hinges-on-a-green-light-at-the-toll-booth/articleshow/103672439.cms,15-09-2023,"Mumbai
: A restructuring plan by lenders to the debt-laden
toll collector
MEP Infrastructure (MIPL) has been delayed for over six months as the Maharashtra government is yet to approve the proposal for extension of its rights even as banks are anxious about their dues from the account which has been classified as a non-performing asset (NPA) for almost two years.
MIPL, a part of the Jayant Mhaiskar-promoted
MEP Infrastructure
Developers (MIDL), owes lenders led by
IDFC First Bank
more than ₹2,600 crore. Its agreement with the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) allows the company to collect tolls at all five entry points into Mumbai. However, the sharp fall in traffic due to the Covid-19 pandemic and previous issues due to delays in some projects meant the company has been tagged as an NPA in lenders' books. MIDL did not reply to an email seeking comment.
""The proposal by lenders hinges on MSRDC extending MIPL's agreement by one year to November 2027 from November 2026. It also requires the promoter to infuse at least ₹100 crore to make the plan viable. Currently, loans to the company are due in July 2025, the timeframe for which is expected to be extended to July 2026,"" said a person familiar with the plan.
RENEWAL OF RIGHTS STUCK
However, MSRDC the nodal body for roads in the state has not approved the proposal because the state finance department has raised queries on the issue. Documents accessed by ET show that MIPL has claimed losses due to the reduction in traffic during Covid, seeking an increase of 187 days for extra toll collection beyond 2026 when the agreement period ends.

A senior state government official said that besides MIP, other toll collectors in the state had also sought an extension of the toll period.
""The policy for extension has to be cleared by the cabinet because the losses suffered by the toll company have to be calculated. The government will not only have to calculate the number of days needed to recoup the losses suffered, it will also have to account for the increase in the traffic post-Covid and beyond for which a policy will have to be formed,"" the government official said.
MSRDC vice-chairman Radheshyam Mopalwar did not respond to calls and messages.
Responding to ET's queries, lead lender IDFC First Bank said the account was classified as NPA during Covid in 2021. ""Our exposure has been coming down because we continue to receive repayments even while the account is in NPA as traffic has resumed on the toll roads post-Covid. Our exposure is down from ₹1,026 crore in 2019 to ₹716 crore in March 2023. We believe restructuring the account to align the contractual dues with cash flows will be a positive outcome for everybody.""
CASH FLOW WOES
The holding company MIDL has 38 subsidiaries and joint ventures for different projects. Not all lenders are receiving payments.
""Lenders to the SPV that collected tolls on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, for example, have been left high and dry with outstanding debt of ₹80 crore as MIPL was replaced as the toll collector for the bridge last year. Since there are no cash flows now, the two lenders to this entity have to explore legal means or bargain for a settlement with the promoter to recover any dues,"" said a second person familiar with the situation.
Besides IDFC First, other lenders to the group include IIFCL,
Bank of India
,
Bank of Maharashtra
and
Canara Bank
together with some co-operative banks.
Lenders are hoping for a long-term solution to the company's debt issues or they will have to look at replacing MIPL as the contractor on a project-by-project basis which will be a time-consuming process.

Ashoka concessions restarts talks to sell BOT toll road assets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/ashoka-concessions-restarts-talks-to-sell-bot-toll-road-assets/articleshow/103644084.cms,14-09-2023,"Ashoka Concessions
, a subsidiary of highway builder
Ashoka Buildcon
, has restarted negotiations to sell its build-operate-transfer (
BOT
) toll road assets after PE major
KKR
terminated the proposed transaction in May.
Global funds such as Canada's CDPQ,
Macquarie
, Cube Highways, and India's NIIF are in early stages of talks to acquire the assets, multiple people aware of the development said.
CDPQ
is in talks through its infrastructure trust - Indian Highway Concessions Trust.
In 2021, Ashoka Concessions (
ACL
) and
Galaxy Investments II
, an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR), had signed an agreement for the sale of five BOT toll subsidiaries - Ashoka Highways (
Bhandara
), Ashoka Highways (Durg), Ashoka Belgaum Dharwad Tollway, Ashoka Sambalpur Baragarh Tollway, and Ashoka Dhankuni Kharagpur Tollway - for ₹1,337 crore. However, the agreement was terminated in May 2023.
From the total proceeds expected from the sale to KKR, the company was to utilise ₹1,200 crore to facilitate the exit of SBI Macquarie from ACL. Ashoka Buildcon holds 66% stake in the firm while SBI Macquarie holds the rest. Macquarie had invested ₹800 crore in Ashoka Concessions in 2012 through Macquarie-SBI Infrastructure Fund (MSIF).
NIIF has signed agreements to acquire Ashoka's stake in two road projects - Jaora Nayagaon Toll Road Company in
Madhya Pradesh and Chennai Outer Ring Road
.

The company is expecting closure of these two transactions by December and October, respectively, the management told analysts in an earnings call in August.
The management also noted then that this time around they expect a ""substantially good"" price over and above the offered price in the last process for the sale of the five BOT assets as the traffic revenue of the roads has been far better than estimated in the previous sale model.

Dawra emphasized that PM
Gatishakti
goes beyond infrastructure connectivity, focusing on socio-economic area-based development as part of regional connectivity.
She highlighted the Indian government's targeted investments in infrastructure, its adoption of geospatial and cutting-edge technologies, and the positive impact on both Ease of Doing Business and Ease of Living, said the release.
The release stated, ""PM Gatishakti National Master Plan is a GIS data-based digital platform with over 1400 data layers and 50+ tools. It provides visual representation of trunk and utility infrastructure, land use, existing structures, soil quality, habitation, tourism sites, forest-sensitive areas, and more.""
This platform enables data-driven decision-making, including site suitability assessments.
One of the notable features of PM Gatishakti is its spatial/area-based holistic development approach, focusing on critical project locations, industrial clusters, tourist sites, and social sector assets.
This approach ensures that connectivity infrastructure aligns with the manufacturing value chain, logistics facilities, and social sector institutions such as schools and hospitals.
PM Gatishakti has played a pivotal role in extending India's multimodal corridors, including industrial road corridors, rail freight corridors, and waterway networks, thereby enhancing regional connectivity and trade with neighbouring countries, read the release.
Since its launch, the program has evaluated 100 projects worth USD 71.26 billion, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing infrastructure development and minimizing investment risks, read the release.
Dawra cited examples of projects like the Indo-Nepal Haldia Access Controlled Corridor and the Regional Waterways Grid, showcasing how PM Gatishakti has bolstered connectivity with regional partners.
Furthermore, Dawra suggested that ADB and partner countries could draw valuable lessons from PM Gatishakti's approach for broadening the scope of their regional cooperation programs.
By integrating area-centric growth models, similar benefits of time and cost savings in project planning and reduced carbon footprint of infrastructure projects could be achieved, said the release.
In addition to PM Gatishakti, Dawra presented India's other digital initiatives in the logistics sector, such as the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and
Logistics Data Bank
(LDB).
These initiatives enhance trade facilitation and ease of logistics through various functionalities, attracting private-sector investments.
Overall, India's PM Gatishakti approach for spatial transformation and area-based infrastructure development is poised to build
Next Generation Infrastructure
while promoting Ease of Living and Ease of Doing Business.
India generously offered its indigenously developed GIS-based technology to ADB and SASEC countries for enhancing socio-economic planning and regional cooperation, stated the release.
The conference served as a platform for knowledge sharing and collaboration, with India's innovative strategies taking centre stage in the quest for regional integration and development.

The leV, produced by Ashok Leyland's EV arm Switch Mobility, presents an attractive value proposition for MSMEs, cottage industries, and e-commerce in the country with low total cost of ownership coupled with a commitment to high uptime.
This is India's first fuel cell bus. Also, Ashok Leyland unveiled a new 9m hydrogen fuel cell bus, the country's first hydrogen internal combustion engine truck, on the occasion.
""As we celebrate this milestone (of 75 years)...we renew our pledge to further shape the future of the CV (commercial vehicle) industry,"" Ashok Leyland's chairman Dheeraj Hinduja said, adding, ""We have set our sights on pioneering sustainable transportation solutions and aim to support India's economic development for years to come.""
Chief Executive Officer of
Switch Mobility Mahesh Babu
said the launch of the Switch IeV series electric vehicles is a defining moment for the EV arm, having established a strong reputation in the e-bus market.
At the event, Nitin Gadkari said hydrogen as an alternative fuel was the future.
""The import of fossil fuel is a big problem for the country in terms of economy and pollution. So, it is imperative to explore and utilise bio fuels for sustenance, and reduce the logistics cost to single digit in about three to four years, from about 16 per cent at present,"" he said.
Further, this would make India competitive and a global player in exports, Gadkari added.

'PM GatiShakti an effective mechanism for fast-tracking infra projects',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/pm-gatishakti-an-effective-mechanism-for-fast-tracking-infra-projects/articleshow/103480179.cms,07-09-2023,"The PM
GatiShakti
initiative is an effective mechanism for fast-tracking
infrastructure projects
and bringing socio-economic area-based development, an official statement said on Thursday. The remark was made by Special Secretary (Logistics) in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)
Sumita Dawra
during a regional cooperation and integration conference, organised by the
Asian Development Bank
(ADB) at Tbilisi, Georgia, on September 5-7.
The objective of the conference was to explore ways to integrate an area-centric approach with economic corridor development (
ECD
) and strengthen regional cooperation.
The commerce and industry ministry statement said that while global pioneers were brought together by ADB to brainstorm over broadening the scope of its ECD framework for regional cooperation, the special secretary highlighted that India has already operationalised the initiative for infrastructure development.
PM GatiShakti NMP, a GIS data-based digital platform with more than 1,400 data layers and over 50 tools, provides a visual depiction of trunk and utility infrastructure, land use, existing structures (like bridge and railway crossing), soil quality, habitation sprawl, tourism sites, forest-sensitive areas, and functionalities for data-based decisionmaking such as site suitability, among others.
""Since the launch of this programme, 100 projects worth USD 71.26 billion have been evaluated during 54 meetings of the
Network Planning Group
, a critical institutional body established for ensuring adoption of GatiShakti principles in infrastructure planning,"" the statement said.
Live Events
Highlighting examples of the Indo-Nepal Haldia Access Controlled Corridor project for seamless connectivity and trade movement between Nepal and eastern Indian states, and the Regional Waterways Grid (RWG) project for multimodal connectivity to growth centres and border points, she showcased the PM GatiShakti adoption in enhancing connectivity with regional partners.
At the same time, she suggested that ADB and partner countries can draw lessons for broadening the scope of their regional cooperation programmes like South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) by integrating area-centric growth models on the lines of this initiative.

Presentation on CAG's Bharatmala Pariyojana report made to PAC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/presentation-on-cags-bharatmala-pariyojana-report-made-to-pac/articleshow/103403663.cms,05-09-2023,"A presentation of the recent
CAG
report on the '
Bharatmala Pariyojana
' was made at a meeting of the
Parliament
's Public Accounts Committee headed by Congress MP Adhir
Ranjan Chowdhury
on Tuesday, sources said. The audit report on the implementation of Phase-I of the 'Bharatmala Pariyojana' highway projects triggered a political row with opposition parties alleging corruption in the process of awarding the project.
The Road Transport and Highways Ministry, however, has said the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) findings that the cost was exorbitant are misplaced as it did not factor in the actual cost.
The sources said at the PAC's meeting on Tuesday, there was a presentation on the CAG report, which was tabled in Parliament on August 10.
The PAC is a committee of selected MPs that audits the revenue and expenditure of the government, and its primary function is to examine a report of the CAG after it is tabled in Parliament.
During the meeting, they said, opposition members raised concerns after the 'Bharatmala Pariyojana' report's presentation.

The minister also questioned the officials about the progress of projects in the old annual plan. The value of projects sanctioned under old annual plan is approximately Rs 3.5 lakh crore.
""These are sanctioned for long, solve the problems and start immediately. If such projects can be converted into BOT or PPP model, give the recommendations for improving it, see why the projects given to state government did not complete, change the contractors if not delivering,"" Gadkari said.
There should be transparency, coordination and cooperation and most importantly accountability among all the departments during execution of the projects, he noted.

The maximum number of projects recommended by the group are related to roads, railways and urban development.
A total of 40 road projects with a total investment of Rs 3.65 lakh crore, 40 railway projects worth Rs 95,704 crore and 8 urban development projects valued at Rs 79,016 crore have been approved.
The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has planned over 1,400 kilometres of roads to date and the Ministry of Railways has planned over 13,000 km of track length using the National Master Plan (NMP), Dawra said.
The NMP has a number of layers of geospatial data showing all physical and social infrastructure of an area and land records in one place. It has been designed for faster planning and better design so that the impact of an investment is maximised.
""In case of Detailed Route Survey (DRS) done by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, it used to take 6-9 months to prepare 46 reports manually, but now using NMP through electronic DRS with the click of a button, the reports get created, which has made the process simpler and faster,"" she said.
The NPG has representations from various connectivity infrastructure ministries/ departments involving their heads of network planning division for unified planning and integration of the proposals.
All these departments approach the NPG first for approval before making a DPR (Detailed Project Report) at the planning stage. After the NPG's clearance, the project follows the normal procedure of approval by the finance ministry and the Cabinet.
Over 1,400 layers of data, including those related to land, ports, forest, and highways, are available on the portal.
Usage of the portal by different ministries, including social sector departments and states, are increasing and it is helping in proper planning of projects, she said.

"L&T, HAL vetted to bid on India rocket privatisation",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/lt-hal-vetted-to-bid-on-india-rocket-privatisation/articleshow/103058647.cms,25-08-2023,"Larsen & Toubro and
Hindustan Aeronautics
are among companies vetted to potentially bid in
India
's efforts to privatise its small
satellite launch
rocket, a source told Reuters, as the government seeks more investment in the booming space market.
The Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (
SSLV
) was developed by the
Indian Space Research Organisation
(ISRO), the national space agency, as a low-cost means to launch satellites weighing up to 500 kg (1,102 lb) into low-earth orbit.
They serve a booming market to launch clusters of satellites for communications and data that SpaceX and rivals compete in.
About 20 companies had submitted an expression of interest in bidding on the privatisation, the first of its kind under a policy drive by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to open launch and other space businesses to investment.
India is aiming to increase its share of the global satellite launch market by fivefold within the next decade.
Live Events
The next step will be to open the bidding process itself, the person said, who had direct knowledge of the matter but asked not to be named because discussions are not public.
The companies did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Hindustan Aeronautics, also known as
HAL
, and Larsen & Toubro, an industrial conglomerate, already have a contract with the government to manufacture and deliver rockets to ISRO.
Under that contract, the companies will manufacture and deliver five
Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles
(
PSLV
) - often called ISRO's ""workhorse"" rocket. Deliveries are expected to start in two years.
ISRO will use the PSLV, which stands 44 meters tall (144 feet), to launch a space-based solar observatory, its Aditya-L1 mission, next month.
That launch will be ISRO's first mission since it achieved a historic first by landing the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the moon's south pole this week.
The success of Chandrayaan-3 has been expected to give a boost to India's efforts to spur private investment in space ventures. ISRO suppliers and related companies have seen seen an uptick in share prices this week.
India's newly created space regulatory body, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre, known as IN-SPACe, opened the bidding process on the SSLV program in July by allowing qualified companies to register an interest.
It will be the first Indian rocket to be fully privatised, meaning that the winning bidder or consortium will take over the entire program, in contrast to a more limited contract for manufacturing the PSLV rockets.

Natural Gas
said at a
real estate
event by Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of
India
(
CREDAI
).
Puri said that India is rapidly urbanising and by 2030, it is estimated that more than 600 million people will reside in its cities.
“At the same time, cities are also major contributors to
climate change
. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that cities emit up to 75% of the global CO2-equivalent emissions globally. Buildings and urban transport are amongst the largest contributors,” Puri said at the event.
A recent study by the
World Economic Forum
states that buildings and building construction related activities account for 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to deforestation and depletion of raw materials.
The most important raw material, cement, is responsible for about a quarter of all industry CO2 emissions.

McKinsey
estimates that decarbonising the built environment can create as much as $800 billion to $1.9 trillion in new green value pools across sectors.
“There is a dire need to innovate from conventional construction approaches. Considering that India is witnessing a relative construction boom amidst slowdown in the sector in China and other large nations, India can realise a significant portion of these potential value pools,” Puri said.
In 2010, a study had estimated that India needed to add about 700-900 sq. metres of commercial and residential space every year to meet its
urbanisation
demands for 2030.
PMAY-U has emerged as one of the largest
affordable housing
schemes in the world by sanctioning more than 1.18 crore houses, of which 1.13 crore houses have already been grounded and more than 76 lakh houses delivered to beneficiaries.
About 43.3 lakh houses under the mission are being constructed using sustainable building materials such as fly ash bricks/blocks and AAC blocks. These houses will contribute to a reduction of 9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions by the end of December 2024.
In 2021, a study by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) stated that the GHG emissions
mitigation
potential from all PMAY-U houses was estimated to be 12 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs shortlisted 54 innovative construction technologies from all over the world under the Global Housing Technology Challenge (GHTC).
Further, six light house projects were selected in Chennai, Rajkot, Indore, Lucknow, Ranchi and Agartala under which 6,368 houses are being built.
“There are more first-time home buyers, especially under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). With demand set to remain high, the real estate sector has a vital role to play,” said Puri.
The real estate sector influences approximately 53% (8% directly and 45% indirectly) of India's economy, through strong forward and backward linkages with core sectors such as steel and cement. An estimated 270 allied industries and 37 crore people benefit either directly and indirectly from the real estate sector.
“We need to get the mammoth task of adding more housing accomplished at a pretty quick rate while also ensuring its sustainability and climate resilience. This requires high construction quality standards and the adoption of new and emerging building materials. The six light house projects are a pilot exercise, aimed to initiate a sweeping change in the approaches adopted by the Indian construction industry,” Puri said.
Manoj Joshi, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs said that there is a need to take these technologies to smaller town as well.
Boman Irani, President, CREDAI said that contribution of real estate in the country’s GDP is expected to more than double in the next five years.
“Real estate currently accounts for about 6% of GDP but we expect it to reach 15-16% by 2027,” Irani said.

"PM GatiShakti: Network Planning Group endorses infra projects worth Rs 7,693 cr",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/pm-gatishakti-network-planning-group-endorses-infra-projects-worth-rs-7693-cr/articleshow/103020140.cms,24-08-2023,"The 54th
Network Planning Group
(NPG) has recommended four infrastructure projects to be developed at a combined cost of Rs 7, 693.17 crore. The four-lane Thiruvananthapuram Outer Ring Road (ORR), under Bharatmala Pariyojana, in Kerala worth Rs 4,767.20 crore is among the projects that have been recommended. Another road project, Dahod-Bodeli-Vapi Corridor, with a project outlay of Rs 1,179.33 crore, has also got the
NPG
’s nod endorsement.
Other two projects that have been approved are new broad gauge railway lines, in Rajasthan, between Pushkar – Merta (Rs 799.64 crores), and Merta City – Ras Railway Stations (Rs 947 crores).
An official statement said the proposed Pushkar – Merta line will provide direct connectivity from Central India to
Northern India
as well as to Western border. “It will decongest and reduce pressure on Highways,” the statement said. The line between Merta City-Ras Railway stations is aimed at facilitating quicker movement of goods and promoting industrial and overall development in the region encompassing
Pali
and Nagaur districts of Rajasthan.
A four-lane Thiruvananthapuram Outer Ring Road (ORR), under Bharatmala Pariyojana, in Kerala, is part of the Mumbai-Kanyakumari Economic Corridor. “The project is essential to provide smooth and faster connectivity to Eastern Region from Northern Region…The project will reduce travel time, save vehicle operation cost, and will provide last-mile connectivity to the new international sea port in
Vizhinjam
,” the statement said.
The Dahod-Bodeli-Vapi Corridor project starts at the junction of the new Vadodara-Delhi Expressway and ends at post Mumbai-Vadodara expressway. “It forms an important connectivity with Bodeli, Devaliya,
Rajpipla
, Netrang, Vyara, Dharampur, Vapi and further Southwards to
Mumbai
via Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway under implementation,” the statement added.

"In major recast, National Highway agencies likely to get dedicated cadre",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/in-major-recast-national-highway-agencies-likely-to-get-dedicated-cadre/articleshow/102881093.cms,21-08-2023,"The Centre is eyeing a significant restructuring of the agencies executing highway projects to create a dedicated cadre so that executives from within the executing organizations can be promoted to top jobs, departing from the current practice of using officers on deputation to man key roles.
These changes will make
National Highways Authority of India
(
NHAI
) and National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corp Ltd (
NHIDCL
) operate more like Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) that do not have frequent transfers of officers from parent ministries.
It is also expected to eliminate the culture of having a senior bureaucrat at the top, allowing cadre officers to climb to the highest rung of the organizational ladder.
""A sense of ownership needs to be developed within NHAI and NHIDCL officers,"" a top government official told ET, adding that plans are underway to alter the composition of these central agencies.
Both NHAI and NHICL are the primary arms of the government tasked with constructing national highway projects.

According to official estimates, NHAI presently has 905 regular staffers. Of them, 258 are on deputation from various state governments, Public Work Departments (PWDs), Military Engineering Services (MES), Border Roads Organisation, and the Centre.
Among Group A officers, there are 557 on the NHAI rolls while 251 are on deputation. Of this, 84 are from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH).
""Around one-third of NHAI staff is on deputation. There are vacancies of around 500 more, which will also need to be filled by the deputation route,"" a second senior official said, adding that the manpower shortage is regularly being flagged.
These officers would oversee the expenditure of ₹1.62 lakh crore allocated to NHAI for road building during the financial year 2023-24.
""NHAI is inducting officers as Deputy Managers. As they get promoted, deputation from state governments will not be needed,"" the official added.
This approach of relying on deputation officers for key roles in NHAI and NHIDCL has its critics.
""More technical expertise also needs to be honed within the organisations to better assess and prepare detailed project reports (DPRs) for highways and wayside amenities, and multi-modal logistic parks that are being developed in the country,"" the first official quoted above added.

PPP push: FinMin asks infra depts to identify projects for private partnership,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/ppp-push-finmin-asks-infra-depts-to-identify-projects-for-private-partnership/articleshow/102881039.cms,21-08-2023,"The finance ministry has asked infrastructure departments to identify projects that can be executed with private partnership, a person aware of the details said.
The move is aimed at drawing greater private capital into public infrastructure and reducing delays in project implementation, according to the person, who said the focus will also be on improving the fund flow into sectors such as
urban infrastructure
,
railways
and roads, where private participation remains either minimal or far from impressive.
The ministry is planning to roll out in this financial year a new public-private partnership (
PPP
) architecture and a standard model concession agreement (MCA) framework for various infrastructure sectors.
""While the government has walked the extra mile to boost capital spending in recent years, it's also desirable to increase the participation of private players, as the funding requirements in infrastructure remain large,"" the person told ET on condition of anonymity.
The planned MCA framework will serve as a standard reference document for various infrastructure departments and state-run entities. It will offer enough flexibility to them to suitably build in clauses peculiar to their sectors. The focus will be on making the projects bankable and viable to woo private investors, said the person.
Live Events
The move comes at a time when broader private investments have started picking up, with senior industry executives expecting a broad-based resurgence in 2023-24.
The government is also nudging central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) to boost capital expenditure without delay, said the person.
In April 2020, a government task force on the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) had envisaged capital investments of ₹111 lakh crore until 2024-25. The Centre (39%) and the states (40%) were expected to have almost an equal share in the NIP implementation, followed by the private sector (21%).
However, the pandemic delayed a revival in private investments, as companies deferred expansion plans. This forced the government to sharply raise its capital spending to prop up economic growth, betting on its high multiplier effect.
The Centre's budgetary capital spending more than doubled to ₹7.28 lakh crore in 2022-23 from the pre-Covid-19 (2019-20) levels, reflecting the hefty increases in allocations in recent years. The capex outlay has again been raised 37.4% for 2023-24 to a record ₹10 lakh crore.
At the same time, the Centre has nudged various infrastructure departments to spend on time, exhausting a bulk of the full-year allocation in the first half itself.
The central government's capital spending surged 59% year-on-year in the June quarter to ₹2.78 lakh crore. It spent 28% of its budgeted capex for the entire year in the June quarter, the highest in five years.
Roads and railways, which have been allocated half of the total
budgetary capex outlay
for this fiscal, led the spending in the first quarter as well. As much as 38% of this fiscal's allocation for roads and 33% for railways were utilised in the first quarter, according to a Crisil report.

As many as 388 infra projects show cost overruns of Rs 4.65 lakh crore in July: MoSPI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/as-many-as-388-infra-projects-show-cost-overruns-of-rs-4-65-lakh-crore-in-july/articleshow/102870754.cms,20-08-2023,"As many as 388
infrastructure projects
, each entailing an investment of Rs 150 crore or more, have been hit by cost overruns of more than Rs 4.65 lakh crore in July 2023, an official report said.
According to the Ministry of
Statistics
and Programme Implementation, which monitors infrastructure projects worth Rs 150 crore and above, out of 1,646 projects, 388 reported cost overruns and as many as 809 projects were delayed.
""Total original cost of implementation of the 1,646 projects was over Rs 23,92,837.89 crore and their anticipated completion cost is likely to be Rs 28,58,394.39 crore, which reflects overall cost overruns of Rs 4,65,556.50 crore (19.46 per cent of original cost),"" the ministry's latest report for July 2023 said.
According to the report, the expenditure incurred on these projects till July 2023 was Rs 15,21,550.38 crore, which was 53.23 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects.
However, it stated that the number of delayed projects decreased to 602 if the delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion.

Further, it stated that for 345 projects, neither the year of commissioning nor the tentative gestation period has been reported.
Out of the 809 delayed projects, 177 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 192 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 318 projects for 25-60 months and 122 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 809 delayed projects is 37.44 months.
Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delay in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

"Land acquisition, flyovers and tunnels raised Bharatmala cost: Official",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/land-acquisition-flyovers-and-tunnels-raised-bharatmala-cost-official/articleshow/102781294.cms,17-08-2023,"The cost of
highway projects
under the
Bharatmala
programme rose significantly from initial estimates due to the construction of wider highways, tunnels, flyovers, and more expensive land acquisition, a top
Roads Ministry
official said.
Speaking to ET, the official said that the Comptroller and Auditor General (
CAG
) report on Bharatmala has overlooked multiple intricacies while concluding that were cost overruns in the Rs 5.35 lakh crore programme.
This programme was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in July 2017.
In its report tabled in Parliament on August 10, the CAG concluded that only 75.62% of approved length has been awarded while 158.24% of approved financial outlay was sanctioned up to March 31, 2023.
The auditor also flagged irregularities in award of highway projects by
National Highways Authority of India
(NHAI) and the National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL). These are the implementing agencies which develop centrally funded road projects.

""The CCEA approval for Bharatmala did not cover cost of flyovers and ring roads. Land acquisition cost alone has gone up by five times from original estimates of Rs 30,000 crore. There is also inflation that has jacked up road building material costs,"" the official said, explaining that these points will soon officially be explained to the auditor.
Responding to a query on discrepancies highlighted in the bidding process by CAG, the official said that a probe will be initiated in any instances that are brought to the notice of the government.
According to the CAG, many instances of irregularities in award of projects by implementing agencies were observed in violation of the prescribed processes of tendering.
In its recommendation, the auditor noted that anomalies in tendering and selection process of concessionaires ""should be investigated to fix responsibility on erring officials who failed to ensure due adherence to prescribed rules and guidelines.""

"Government saved 12 per cent in construction cost in awarding Dwarka Expressway project, says road ministry sources",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/government-saved-12-per-cent-in-construction-cost-in-awarding-dwarka-experssway-project-says-road-ministry-sources/articleshow/102777566.cms,16-08-2023,"The government saved over 12 per cent in construction cost against estimates in awarding contracts of Urban Extension Road-II or Dwarka Expressway, and
CAG
findings that the cost was exorbitant are misplaced as the auditor did not factor in the actual cost, top sources in the road transport ministry said. According to reports, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had found that the
National Highways Authority of India
's (NHAI) decision to go for an elevated carriageway on the Haryana portion of the
Dwarka Expressway
pushed up the construction cost to Rs 251 crore per kilometre from Rs 18.2 crore per km estimated earlier.
The audit report on the implementation of Phase-I of the '
Bharatmala Pariyojana
' highway projects, triggered a political row with the opposition parties alleging corruption in the process of awarding the project.
The ministry sources explained that all four packages of Dwarka Expressway were put for tender at an average civil cost of Rs 206.39 crore per kilometre but the contracts were finally awarded at a lower rate of Rs 181.94 crore per km.
The average civil construction cost of the four packages of the expressway was 12 per cent lower than the estimates, they said.
The sources also explained that the CAG has simply divided the total cost of construction of Rs 91,000 crore under National Corridor Efficiency Programme with the project's entire length of 5,000 kilometres under development.

They said the CAG has itself noted that the cost of construction of Rs 18.2 per kilometre does not include the cost norms for flyovers, ring roads, etc.
They are of the view that the expressway in question has elevated roads, underpasses, tunnels and other components which were not part of the project.
The cost of Rs 91,000 crore for 5,000 km under Bharatmala Phase-I project was finalised by the ministry on August 10, 2016 for the year 2016-17 to the extent possible.
According to the ministry, the expressway is the country's first eight-lane elevated road on single pier with four level interchange facility.
It has eight-lane 3.6-km tunnel and another six-lane 2.4-km tunnel for connecting it with the Delhi airport.
Besides, it has elevated service roads at major interchanges.
The ministry sources said that they would try to convey their comments on the issue to the CAG and would submit their views whenever it would come up for discussion in the Public Accounts Committee.
On Monday, Delhi Chief Minister
Arvind
Kejriwal had alleged that the Narendra Modi government has broken ""all records of corruption"" after the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) of India reportedly flagged the ""very high"" construction cost of the Dwarka Expressway.
However, the road, transport and highways ministry in a statement had rejected the charge, calling it as ""gross misrepresentation of facts"".
""The Modi government has broken all the records of corruption in the past 75 years,"" Kejriwal alleged in a post on X, earlier known as Twitter, sharing a screenshot of a media report on the CAG findings.
Addressing a press conference at the Aam Aadmi Party headquarters here,
AAP
's Rajya Sabha member and national spokesperson Sanjay Singh also targeted Prime Minister Modi and said his government is the ""most corrupt"" since independence.
""The Narendra Modi government constructed the road (Dwarka Expressway) at a cost of Rs 250 crore per kilometer while it was to be constructed at the rate of Rs 18 crore per kilometer,"" he had said, citing the
CAG report
.
Dismissing the charge, the ministry had said the factual position of the cost per kilometer is that in the approval of the 'Bharatmala Pariyojana', such project-wise cost was not approved.
""It only provided overall outlay for the programme. As such, ascribing an increase of cost from Rs 18.2 crore per kilometre to Rs 250 crore per kilometre is gross misrepresentation of facts,"" the ministry had said in a statement.
It said that the per kilometer cost of Rs 18.2 crore was considered as ""normative cost"" for formulation of the 'Bharatmala Pariyojana' for approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
""The civil cost/capital cost of the project being undertaken under the 'Bharatmala Pariyojana' varies based on its design features, terrain and geographical locations,"" the ministry had said.
Under the 'Bharatmala Pariyojana', the ministry said, the average cost for special projects enveloping substantial lengths of ""bridges/via-ducts/tunnels"" is Rs 152 crore per kilometer.
""It may be appreciated that construction cost varies based on the nature of the project,"" it had added.
Meanwhile, the AAP on Wednesday protested at the under-construction Dwarka Expressway here.
Several party leaders and workers, including chief national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar, and Reena Gupta, gathered near the Dwarka Expressway and said the project is a ""scam"".
""This is such a big scam that the road, for which an approval of Rs 18 crore per km was given, was built at a cost of Rs 251 crore,"" Kakkar told PTI.

SC stays proceedings initiated by Rel Infra’s Delhi Airport Metro Express,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/sc-stays-proceedings-initiated-by-rel-infras-delhi-airport-metro-express/articleshow/102725874.cms,14-08-2023,"The
Supreme Court
on Monday deferred the proceedings initiated by
Reliance
Infrastructure’s Delhi Airport
Metro Express Pvt Ltd
(DAMEPL) for the execution of the Rs 4700-crore arbitration award that it won against Delhi Metro Rail Corp (DMRC) in May 2017.
The stay by the apex court is granted till it hears DMRC’s curative petition.
SC has also issued notice to 'Reliance Infrastructure firm' and others on appeals filed by the Centre and the Delhi government against the HC order which directed attachment of the entire amount in the credit of the metro operator if it failed to pay the dues.
Earlier, DAMEPL had filed a contempt petition in the Delhi High Court against the Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Metro Rail Corp for ""wilful and deliberate disobedience"" of the court's order directing the payment of the Rs 4,700 crore arbitration award the company had won, reported ET.
DAMEPL in its fresh contempt petition said that the respondents, including the Centre and Delhi government, have failed to comply with any of the High Court's directions. Instead of making payments under the award, the Centre and Delhi government appealed to SC against the high court order, it said, adding that they are ""playing hide and seek"" with the High Court.

CAG audit flags huge cost overruns in Dwarka Expressway project,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/cag-audit-flags-huge-cost-overruns-in-dwarka-expressway-project/articleshow/102715287.cms,14-08-2023,"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (
CAG
), in a latest audit report, has flagged huge cost overruns in the
Dwarka Expressway
project.
The National Highways Authority of India (
NHAI
)'s decision to opt for elevated carriageway on the Haryana portion of the expressway has pushed up the construction cost to Rs 251 crore per km from the originally approved Rs 18.2 crore per km, the report pointed out.
The NHAI is building the expressway in question under the Bharatmala programme. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had approved an overall average construction cost of Rs 18.2 crore per km while approving the Bharatmala programme.
The CAG's audit report dealt with the ‘Implementation of Phase-I of Bharatmala Pariyojana (BPP-1)’. It found that the NHAI Board approved the Dwarka Expressway with ""civil cost of Rs 7,287.29 crore with per km Rs 250.77 crore as against per km civil cost of Rs 18.2 crore approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA)"".
The project was approved for decongesting NH-48 between Delhi and Gurgaon. The CAG said that the Haryana government had handed over 90 meter right of way (RoW) to NHAI free of cost and to build a 14-lane highway at grade, 70-75 meter of RoW was enough.

""However, for no reasons on record, the project highway in the Haryana region, where its length was 19 km, was planned with eight lane elevated main carriage way and six lane at grade road when NHAI already had 90 meter right of way and the same was sufficient for building 14 lane at grade national highway,"" it said.
According to officials quoted by ToI, while CCEA's nod was based on building standard four-lane highways, this specific project is of 14 lanes — eight-lane access-controlled and six lanes of service roads. Most of the access-controlled part is elevated.
The
CAG report
pointed out that the construction cost of the expressway rose manifold owing to such massive structures.
As per sources cited by ToI, the expressway was approved after multiple rounds of inter-ministerial consultations and after considering the trend of high traffic growth between Delhi and Gurgaon.
They made a reference to the experience of 8-lane Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, which got choked within five years after it became fully operational.
The report also revealed that the NHAI board had also approved the Delhi-Vadodara Expressway with civil cost of around Rs 32,839 crore — a project that was not included in the CCEA-approved list of BPP-I projects.
According to the CAG, ""NHAI, which was developing 70,950 km of national highways length out of 76,999 km of national highways length determined for BPP-I, was also delegated the power to decide the mode of construction of the projects being implemented by it. Audit observed that the decisions on mode of construction were being taken by NHAI without any valid justification on record.""
""The audit further observed that before delegating the powers to decide the mode of construction of projects, the appraisal and approval mechanism proposed to CCEA did not define the term ‘project’ and ‘package’. Thus, for taking decision on mode of construction, whether the packages in which a single project was divided for construction purposes would constitute separate projects or all packages combined would constitute a single project was not clearly defined, the CAG further said in its report.
The implementing bodies did not follow the appraisal and approval mechanism prescribed by the CCEA for BPP-I, the CAG report pointed out. ""Out of 50 sample projects of NHAI, in case of eight projects, appraisal by Project Appraisal and Technical Scrutiny Committee was not done due to either these being appraised under old NHDP programme or they being balance works/ one time improvement works,"" the report said.
In 35 out of 50 projects, tender notices were floated without any technical and financial appraisal of projects by Project Appraisal and Technical Scrutiny Committee, the report revealed. The process was done afterwards, it added.
The CAG found that ""out of these 35 sample projects, in case of two projects viz, Shamli-Muzaffarnagar (Pkg-II) and Delhi-Vadodara Expressway (Pkg -18), the Project Appraisal and Technical Scrutiny Committee did not include any expert from NITI Aayog.""
The report also flagged that the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway could remain ""underutilised"" for the next 25 years. That is because of the fact that the stretch has more lane capacity than needed to meet the next 15 years' traffic demand, it added.

Public expenditure quality of states improves in Q1FY24: Ind-Ra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/public-expenditure-quality-of-states-improves-in-q1fy24-ind-ra/articleshow/102655911.cms,11-08-2023,"Higher tax devolution coupled with rising revenues and lower subsidy outgoes helped improve the quality of public expenditure of states in the first quarter of FY24, according to an analysis by
India Ratings and Research
(Ind-Ra), which it said augurs well for the Indian economy.
Ind-Ra noted that the trend is likely to continue. “Front-loading of additional instalment of tax devolution and timely approval of projects under the interest-free capex loans by the union government (Rs 56,415 billion in June 2023) and buoyancy in own tax revenues would keep up the momentum of states’ capex,” said Paras Jasrai, senior analyst at the rating agency.
Of the 20 states analysed by Ind-Ra, 16 recorded higher capex spending compared to the previous year, with an over 70% jump compared to the previous year. The capital outlay to revenue expenditure ratio, a measure of the quality of states’ spending, increased to 13.9% in Q1FY24 compared with 8.5% in the first quarter of the previous fiscal.
“The front-loading of capex by the 20 states has been contrary to the trend witnessed historically, wherein a major chunk of capex used to be undertaken in the second half of a fiscal year,” Ind-Ra noted, highlighting that Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat were the significant contributors to the capex push.
However, Ind-Ra expressed concerns over states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Chhattisgarh witnessing a dip in capex share.
Live Events
“The significant fall in the share of Karnataka and Maharashtra in the aggregate capex during the same period may become a concern if it persists in the remaining quarters of FY24,” it pointed out.
The report noted that the fiscal performance of the states also improved, with the fiscal deficit coming in 2.3% lower compared to the previous year. Moreover, nine of the 20 states recorded a fiscal surplus.
The fiscal position improvement was due to a 21.8% rise in revenue receipts in Q1FY24. States' own tax revenue grew 12.3%, whereas central transfers were up 58.9%.
States would also need to be prudent in spending. In the first quarter, spending on subsidies was down 7.3% from the previous year, whereas salary payments were 15.8% lower. Pension and interest payments were up during the year.
“Generally, the states tend to align their revenue expenditure with revenue receipts,” Ind-Ra pointed.

CAG flags irregularities in Bharatmala project tenders,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/cag-flags-irregularities-in-bharatmala-project-tenders/articleshow/102617116.cms,10-08-2023,"The
Comptroller and Auditor General
(
CAG
) of India has found instances of irregularities in award of projects by agencies implementing central government funded highway projects. In its report on implementation of Phase-I of Bharatmala Pariyojana, the auditor has also found deficiencies in the appraisal and approval mechanism proposed to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in many of the high cost Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) projects.
The CAG has named the
Delhi-Vadodara Expressway
and the
Dwarka Expressway
which could not be assessed by either CCEA or the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to have the advantage of the scrutiny at that level. “Even the appraisal and approval mechanism decided by CCEA was also not strictly followed,” the CAG said.
Highlighting issues with awarding of projects by implementing agencies, the CAG said that instances of irregularities in award of projects by implementing agencies were observed. This was in clear violation of the prescribed processes of tendering. According to the CAG, the lacunae was in instances of successful bidder not fulfilling tender condition or bidder selected on the basis of falsified documents, award of works without there being approved detailed project reports or based on faulty detailed project report.
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) are the implementing agencies that develop central funded road projects.
CAG also noted that detailed project reports prepared by consultants were not appraised with due diligence by the competent authority before approval of projects. “Instances of adoption of different specifications by contractors or concessionaires at the time of execution of projects than what were prescribed by detailed project report consultants, highlighted the fact that specifications of detailed project reports were not found suitable as per site conditions,” the CAG said.

Pointing out that there were significant cost overruns, the auditor noted that only 75.62% of CCEA approved length has been awarded while 158.24% of approved financial outlay was sanctioned up to March 31, 2023.
The Phase-I of Bharatmala Pariyojana was for development up to September 2022, at an investment outlay of Rs 5,35,000 crore.
According to the CAG, significant changes made in the scope of projects and cost estimates as well as richer project specifications adopted have pushed up the sanctioned cost of projects. “This has resulted in sanctioned civil cost being Rs 23.89 crore per kilometre (km) as against the CCEA approved cost of Rs 13.98 crore per km and sanctioned pre-construction cost being Rs 8.28 crore per km as against the CCEA approved cost of ₹ 1.39 crore per km,” the auditor noted.
In another report, the CAG found that NHAI continued to collect user fee in three toll plazas (namely Nathavalasa, Chalageri, Hebbalu in Southern India) during delayed period of construction. This was in violation of rules stating that no user fee shall be levied for the delayed period, leading to higher toll collection from commuters.

Out of the 815 delayed projects, 193 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 192 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 293 projects for 25-60 months and 137 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 815 delayed projects was 37.49 month.
Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in
land acquisition
, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delay in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

"40% work on Zojila tunnel over; terrain, weather challenges push completion deadline to 2030",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/40-work-on-zojila-tunnel-over-terrain-weather-challenges-push-completion-deadline-to-2030/articleshow/102246271.cms,30-07-2023,"Difficult terrain and weather challenges have pushed the deadline for completion of the
Zojila
tunnel, which will provide all-weather connectivity between the Kashmir valley and the Ladakh region, to December 2030, according to officials. The tunnel, said to be the longest of its kind in Asia and at the highest altitude, will significantly cut down the time to cross the Zojila pass from four hours to just 15 minutes, they said.
Officials said that while 40 per cent of work on the 13-km-long tunnel is already over, the challenges posed by the terrain and weather are such that the rest of the work is taking so much time.
""The area is severely avalanche-prone. The work had to be stopped multiple times due to the difficulties posed by the weather and the terrain. The tunnel was to be completed by December 2026. But now, keeping the challenges in mind, the deadline has been revised to December 2030,"" Captain IK Singh of the Border Roads Organisation told PTI.
The tunnel project through the Zojila Pass at an altitude of 11,578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National Highway is of strategic importance.
The highway remains closed during winter due to heavy snowfall, cutting off the Ladakh region from Kashmir. The tunnel will help overcome this hindrance and prove all-weather connectivity to the Ladakh region.

The single-tube Zojila tunnel, from Baltal in the Ganderbal district of central Kashmir to Minimarg in Drass town of Ladakh's Kargil district, has an approach road of 18 km.
""The total length of the project from Sonamarg to Minimarg is 31 km. From
Sonamarg to Baltal
it is 18 km. Then the main tunnel starts from Baltal and goes to Minimarg. It is 13 km long. The work is going on at a rapid pace on both the projects,""
Imtiaz Ahmed
, the construction manager of
Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited
told PTI here.
MEIL is constructing the tunnel using the new Austrian tunnelling method.
""By using this method, the chances of accidents are very low while the quality and the speed are very high. This technology is applied in Europe and North America,"" he explained.
Ahmed said out of the 13-km stretch, cutting has been done on 6 km -- three km from each end. The stretch remains closed for over four months during winter due to excessive snowfall.
""It not only causes problems for the locals and tourists, but military movement also becomes a challenge during those four months. It is easier to clear snow on the stretch from Dras to Minamarg. However, from Minamarg to Baltal it is very difficult to even clear snow during those months... All these challenges will be addressed once the tunnel is operational,"" he said.
Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
laid the foundation stone for the Zojilla tunnel in 2018. The
Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
, chaired by the prime minister, had approved the construction, operation and maintenance of this tunnel at a total cost of Rs 6,800 crore.

""The concerned administrative ministry may like to review the projects in order to avoid further cost overruns, time overruns, to firm up milestones in case of milestone is not available, to firm up revised cost estimates and revised commissioning schedule if the same has been not revised and lapsed,"" it further said.

minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said the government is focusing on four ‘I’s — infrastructure, investment, innovation and inclusivity — to put in place an “enabling ecosystem” that will catapult
India
into the league of developed nations by 2047.
Through record capital spending outlays, the government has walked the extra mile in recent years in creating durable assets, both in the physical and digital spheres, Sitharaman said Saturday at an event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (
CII
). “We are looking for both public and private investments and creating the necessary environment for attracting
private investment
,” she said at a session moderated by 15th Finance Commission chairman NK Singh. “Blended finance, on which global discussions are going on, is also something that we are looking at.”
In addition to the raft of investor-friendly reforms undertaken in recent years, India has been focusing on skilling its vibrant young population to build a solid workforce, she added. The Centre’s budgetary capital expenditure more than doubled to Rs 7.36 lakh crore in FY23 from preCovid (FY20) levels as it bet big on the high multiplier effect of such expenditure. “In the last 3-5 years, consistently, the public expenditure for infrastructure building has been ramped up significantly and it will reach `.10 lakh crore in 2023-24,” she said.
Sitharaman said the government has opened up several sectors for foreign investment, including space. Innovative ideas will be key to sustained progress, especially in the tech sector, said the FM. The government is also pitching for inclusive growth. “We aim to reach for the developed nation (tag) in 25 years by focusing on inclusiveness, making sure that every section of India, the common man, benefits by everything that we do (whether) investment or reforms… trying to take schemes to the people,” Sitharaman said.
MDBS, G20
The minister called on multilateral development banks (MDBs) to be nimble and address 21st century challenges more efficiently and expeditiously, as she hinted at possible steps to further bolster such in stitutions during India’s ongoing G20 presidency.

Once the second part of the report of a G20 expert group, headed by NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, firms up a road map for an updated ecosystem for MDBs, there will be “some forward movement”, the minister said.
Sitharaman said the G20 has made progress in deliberations on four critical areas -- debt relief for small and poor economies; strengthening of MDBs; a common global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies; and digital public infrastructure. Commenting on the lack of a final communique at the last meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Gandhinagar, ostensibly due to differences over the Ukraine war, the minister said: “The (lack of) communique need not just distract us; action is important.”

FM Sitharaman stresses on attracting private investment to develop urban infra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/fm-sitharaman-stresses-on-attracting-private-investment-to-develop-urban-infra/articleshow/101802854.cms,16-07-2023,"Finance
Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
on Sunday underlined the need for embracing innovative strategies to attract
private investment
, bridge
financing gaps
and foster
sustainable development
of infrastructure in cities. Addressing the 'G20 Infrastructure Investment Dialogue', the minister said that the situation with regard to financing infrastructure has become even more challenging in the wake of monetary policy tightening in key markets.
The tight monetary policy leads to the hardening of interest rates and the burgeoning debt repayment burden.
Against this backdrop, she said, ""
Innovative financing
and funding mechanisms for cities could have significant potential to fill the increasing (funding) gaps.
""It can complement the pool of funds available for infrastructure in addition to public investment and financing provided by Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), she added.
""We need alternate solutions to leverage private sector participation in this context. Innovative financing instruments such as blended finance, structured project finance, securitization, thematic bonds, biodiversity offerings...and local currency finance, are some of the needs,""
Sitharaman
said.

The minister also made a case for developing an ecosystem to improve the creditworthiness of urban local bodies through appropriate policy and regulatory framework.
""...our investment decisions... will shape the future of our cities and determine the quality of life for future generations,"" the minister stressed.
In her opening remark, the minister stressed on the need to recognise the potential of infrastructure in delivering public good and enabling shared prosperity which is the core value underpinning the overall theme of India's G20 Presidency - 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'.
Delivering quality urban infrastructure is one of the most pressing challenges for cities in a rapidly urbanising world.
Today, Sitharman said, 55 per cent of world's population lives in urban areas, which is expected to increase to 68 per cent by 2050.
Massive investment in infrastructure will be needed to accommodate this growth, she said.
Sitharaman said GIFT International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) has been designated as a special international financial jurisdiction with trusted business regulations, competitive tax structure with focus on ease of doing business.
She informed the gathering that GIFT IFSC has more than 400 entities registered across various business segments, including banks, capital markets, insurance, fintech, aircraft leasing, bullion exchange, and is rapidly growing with healthy and increasing participation of international and domestic financial institutions.

Panda who was in Guwahati on Wednesday while talking to ET said that it is for the first ever time FICCI is holding its National Executive Committee Meeting in Guwahati which shows how much priority FICCI gives to Northeast India.
He added, “The region is witnessing surge in the infrastructure development. Lot of focus is given in
capital
expenditure and increasing the per capita income. Lack of connectivity was one of the reason that had hindered the development of the region.”
He said that Hiroshi Suzuki, Ambassador, Embassy of Japan said that the deep sea Matarbari port in Bangladesh funded by JICA will be operational by 2027 and be a game changer for the entire region to connect North Eastern states to sea ports. One of the key pillars of Prime Minister Kishida is the new industrial
value chain
in the Bay of Bengal. India is the top recipient of Japan's official development assistance. Connectivity is getting lot of attention.
Panda said that Assam is not just the largest economy of the region but plays a crucial role in the development of this region. It has a pivotal position in India’s Act East Policy which has been one of the fulcrums of our foreign policy. “The State’s GSDP has grown at nearly 12 per cent in the last decade and advance estimates indicate an astounding 19.52 per cent growth in FY 2023 while per capita income is expected to grow by 15 per cent,” he added.

85 big infra projects worth Rs 5.4 lakh crore recommended for approval under PM GatiShakti,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/85-big-infra-projects-worth-rs-5-4-lakh-crore-recommended-for-approval-under-pm-gatishakti/articleshow/101579439.cms,07-07-2023,"As many as 85 big-ticket infrastructure projects worth Rs 5.4 lakh crore of different ministries have been recommended for approval under the
PM GatiShakti initiative
so far this fiscal, a senior official said on Friday. These projects have been recommended by the Network Planning Group (
NPG
) constituted under the
PM GatiShakti
initiative launched in October last year.
Special secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)
Sumita Dawra
said that so far the NPG has held 51 meetings.
The initiative was launched to develop an integrated infrastructure to reduce logistic costs. All logistics and connectivity infrastructure projects, entailing investments of over Rs 500 crore, are routed through the NPG.
""In total of 51 NPG meetings till date, 85 projects have been evaluated worth Rs 5.39 lakh crore,"" Dawra told reporters here.
The approved projects include 34 from
railways
, 31 from roads and transport, one from new and renewable energy, four from oil and gas, and eight from housing and urban affairs ministry.
Live Events
The NPG has representations from various connectivity infrastructure ministries/ departments involving their heads of network planning division for unified planning and integration of the proposals.
All these departments approach the NPG first for approval before making a DPR (detailed project report) at the planning stage. After the NPG's clearance, the project follows the normal procedure of approval by the
finance ministry
and the
Cabinet
, depending upon the projects.
She said that time taken for DPR has been reduced from six months due to the use of a national master plan portal.
Over 1,460 layers of data, including those related to land, ports, forest, and highways, are available on the portal, Dawra added.
Usage of the portal by different ministries including social sector departments and states are increasing and it is helping in proper planning of projects, she said.
When asked about allowing private sector to use the portal, Dawra said that talks are on for it.
""We have been talking about it...we will look at it...We have to look at issues like which attributes (of the portal) are sensitive...there are several dimensions to it,"" she added.
Further, she informed that the the third Trade and Investment Working Group (TIWG) will be meeting from July 10-12 at Kevadia in
Gujarat
.
During this three-day meeting, over 100 delegates from G20 member countries, invitee countries, regional groupings and international organizations will engage in deliberations to accelerate global trade and investments.
Issues like trade infrastructure, integrating MSMEs in global trade, and building efficient logistics for trade are expected to be discussed in sessions.
She said that the role of infrastructure, logistics and MSME in global value chains will be discussed.

Bullet train project: Railways shares then-now pics of 3 bridges in Gujarat,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train-project-railways-shares-then-now-pics-of-3-bridges-in-gujarat/articleshow/101490199.cms,04-07-2023,"The
National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited
(NHSRCL), which is overseeing the construction of the
Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail
Corridor or popularly called the
bullet train project
, said that the project has made significant progress, citing the completion of three river bridges in last one month in Gujarat.
Railways
has tweeted the before-after pics of the three bridges, saying ""expediting advancements on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) Project.""
The three bridges are between Bilimora and Surat HSR station. The first river bridge (length 360 metres) was completed on Purna river, Gujarat's Navsari district. The challenges included continuous monitoring of high and low tides from Arabian Sea during the construction. The foundation work was also challenging as water level in the river was rising 5-6 m (fortnightly) during high tides, NHSRCL said. The second bridge is on Mindhola rover (240 meters) and the third on Ambika river (200 meters).
The challenges for construction of Ambika river bridge included steep slope of the river bank, underground rocky strata during piling and maximum pier height including pier cap was around 26 m (equal to 10 storey building). It was challenging to work at this height inside the river, NHSRCL said.
According to National High-Speed Rail Corporation, till date, four river bridges have been completed for MAHSR corridor in last six months. There are total 24 river bridges on MAHSR corridor, out of which 20 are in Gujarat and four are in Maharashtra. The construction river bridge of 1.2 km on Narmada river in the bullet train project is currently in progress. A 2.28 km long bridge will be constructed on Vaitarna river in Maharashtra.
Ambika river bridge
""Construction of bridges over the rivers are very challenging and meticulous planning is required. During the construction of bridges over Mindhola and Purna rivers, the tides from the Arabian sea were closely monitored. Our engineers worked on a height of 26 m for the construction of bridge over Ambika river,” said Rajendra Prasad, Managing Director, NHSRCL

Highway building gathers pace in Q1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/highway-building-gathers-pace-in-q1/articleshow/101467079.cms,04-07-2023,"Highway construction accelerated 9.4% year-on-year in the first quarter of this financial year, but new contracts fell to a five-year low, showed data available at June-end.
During the quarter, 2,150 kilometres of
highways
were built, but new projects for only 600 km were awarded, said officials.
India had constructed 1,966 km and awarded 969 km of highways in the corresponding months a year ago.
“Highway construction for the first quarter of the fiscal is higher than the average of the last four years, which stood at 2,057 km,” a senior official told ET on condition of anonymity.
Highways would have been constructed at a faster pace but for the irregular rains, said officials. Sector watchers said the upcoming state assembly elections in December could also cause some delays once the model code of conduct for the polls kicks in.

According to highway contractors, delayed payments also impacted activity.
Highway builders also claim they are not getting due bonuses for timely completion of projects and that there is a shortage of field officers to grant speedy approvals for work that has been done.
“There is lower discretion in the construction framework, and the priority is only cost.
So, of late, contractors have not been satisfied with the payment redress mechanism, which is bent in favour of the government,” an industry executive told ET, adding that absence of senior bureaucrats in key positions of the National Highways Authority of India (

EY is advising Ashoka Buildcon on the sale process.
Of the portfolio of 11 roads, seven projects are operational and four are under construction. Ashoka holds 100% stake in all these projects. These projects are spread across the states of Punjab, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat.
The operational road projects include Kharar-Ludhiana, Ranastalam-Anandpuram, Vadodara Kim, Khairatunda-Barwa Adda, Belgaum-Khanapur, Tumkur-Shivamogga -I, Kandi-Ramsanpalle.
As on March 31, six of these roads collectively generated annuity revenue of ₹881 crore, as per an investor presentation of the company.
The four under construction projects include Tumkur-Shivamogga II, III and IV, and Basawantpur-Singnodi.
Mails sent to Ashoka group and
Edelweiss
did not elicit any responses till the press time Tuesday.
Ashoka's attempt at monetisation of five toll roads by sale to KKR had fell through recently.
In December 2021, Ashoka had entered into an agreement to sell five toll roads housed under Ashoka Concessions to KKR for a consideration of ₹1,337 crore. The transaction was mutually terminated by the two parties.
Of the sale proceeds, ₹1,200 crore was planned to be used to provide a complete exit to
SBI
Macquarie from the Ashoka Concessions platform.

There is a growing concern about cost overruns and delays in implementation of projects, and it is felt that faster clearances can help accelerate execution, said the official.
According to the Ministry of
Statistics
and Programme Implementation's April report, out of 1,605 infrastructure projects worth Rs 150 crore and above, 379 reported cost overruns and as many as 800 were delayed.
Total original cost of these 1,605 projects was Rs 22,85,674.25 crore and their anticipated completion cost is likely to be Rs 27,50,591.38 crore, reflecting an overall cost overrun of Rs 4,64,917.13 crore or 20.34% of the original cost.
A suggestion to raise the threshold for CCEA approval of projects had figured in the discussions at a chintan shivir (brainstorming meeting) on June 19 chaired by cabinet secretary
Rajiv Gauba
.
""During the chintan shivir most of the ministries agreed that the limit for project approval must be doubled for general projects and tripled for infra projects,"" a senior government official privy to the deliberations said on condition of anonymity.
Another suggestion at the meeting was to allow ministries and departments to approve revised costs of infrastructure projects up to 33% in cases where the cost had gone up purely on account of increase in raw material prices. Currently, secretaries can approve an increase in cost of projects up to 20% of the total cost of the project or Rs 75 crore.
If the increase in cost is more than this, the minister-in-charge is authorised to approve it.

The
roads ministry
also expects higher retail participation in the coming round of
National Highways Authority of India
(NHAI) infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) fund raising.
""We are finalising the target of road construction for the current fiscal after undertaking a realistic assessment,"" a senior ministry official told ET. ""We don't want to be too conservative, but also want to ensure that achievable goals are set.""
The Centre had targeted developing 12,200 kilometres (km) of national highways (NH) in 2022-23, but could manage to construct 10,933 km. This was the second consecutive year that the target was missed.
It was earlier expected that the target for highways construction for fiscal 2023-24 will be kept at around 12,500 km, but this is now being reassessed.

official told ET that highway construction goals for the fiscal are being redrawn after top government functionaries expressed dismay at modest targets. He also said there will be higher retail participation in the coming round of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) fund raise.
“We are finalising the target of road construction for the current fiscal after undertaking a realistic assessment. We don’t want to be too conservative, but also want to ensure that achievable goals are set,” the official said adding that the goals being fixed will be kept above those for 2022-23.

"NHAI looks to pare debt via asset monetisation, higher toll income",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/nhai-looks-to-pare-debt-via-asset-monetisation-higher-toll-income/articleshow/101261727.cms,26-06-2023,"The National
Highways
Authority of India (
NHAI
) has drawn up a plan to pare its debt, which stood at Rs 3.43 lakh crore at the end of March, through a mix of
asset monetisation
and improved toll income, officials said.
The NHAI did not borrow in 2022-23 after its budgetary allocation was raised to Rs 1.42 lakh crore and it was stopped from raising more debt. The highways builder has not borrowed in 2023-24 either, when it has been allocated Rs 1.62 lakh crore in the Union budget.
NHAI officials played down concerns over the large debt saying the authority’s income from various sources can be used to repay debt. “NHAI has enough resources to repay the debt. It has been decided that investment in highways will be met from budgetary support while toll income and asset monetisation proceeds would be used to payback debt,” a senior NHAI official told ET on condition of anonymity.
As per internal projections, the NHAI's annual payout to service debt will steadily surpass Rs 62,000 crore in 2028-29 from around Rs 33,000 crore in 2023-24. Its dues are expected to taper subsequently and completely extinguish by 2049-50, if no fresh debt is raised by the authority.

NHAI plans to raise Rs 60,000 crore from securitisation of 4 projects
“The NHAI’s tolling income, from its own projects, has jumped over three times from 2018-19 levels, and reached Rs 16,587.18 crore in 2022-23. This is on the back of more roads under tolling, rising 1.5 times during the same period to 27,820.08 km in 2022-23,” a second NHAI official said, adding that another 5,000 km of roads are projected to be added in this financial year, taking toll income to Rs 22,000 crore.
“Toll income will rise by around 10% annually for the coming decade,” said the first official.
The balance fund requirement will come from a mix of asset monetisation and securitisation. Plans to raise Rs 60,000 crore through
securitisation
of four prominent under-construction roads are already underway.
Another 46 stretches have been identified for asset monetisation models such as toll, operate, transfer (TOT) over the next ten years.

The NHAI is also planning to raise funds using the infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) route. Two rounds of fundraising using this mode have been successful. “Preparation of
InVIT
round three is in advanced stages,” said the official.
The NHAI's debt had surged due to increased focus on the engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), and hybrid annuity model (HAM) contracts from 2014 onwards as private sector appetite for the riskier build, operate, transfer (BOT) projects interest waned.

NHAI
) is seeking to raise ₹60,000 crore through securitisation of four under-construction road projects over the next three-five years, officials said.
A proposal in this regard is before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), said a senior NHAI official, who did not wish to be identified.
""A plan to form four self-sustaining special purpose vehicles (SPVs) has been firmed up. Each of these road assets will be transferred to the SPV that will help in freeing up the NHAI's deployed capital,"" the official told ET.
Visakhapatnam-Raipur, Delhi-Amritsar-Katra, Amritsar-Jamnagar and Chennai-Bengaluru highways could be monetised through this route, said another official.
Under securitisation, the NHAI gets an upfront pay-out for the asset. This amount is reimbursed in tranches from the toll income of the asset to the lender. There is no payment to lenders before toll income is generated from a project.

This model is preferred for road assets that have a high traffic potential, seen as less risky by financial institutions. Transferring an asset to an SPV also lowers NHAI debt as the burden is shifted to the new entity and does not remain on the books of the highway builder.
The total capital requirement for these four highway projects is estimated at ₹90,000 crore.
""Of the total fund requirement, ₹30,000 crore will be infused by the NHAI as equity. Another ₹30,000 crore will be in the form of term loans, and the remaining will be raised from capital markets through institutional investors,"" said the official cited earlier.
The plan emulates the model adopted for the Delhi-Mumbai expressway.

NIIF in talks to raise $244 million for infrastructure,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/indias-niif-in-talks-to-raise-244-million-for-infrastructure/articleshow/101182193.cms,22-06-2023,"India’s National Investment & Infrastructure Fund is in talks to raise at least 20 billion rupees ($244 million) for an infrastructure investment trust, according to people familiar with the matter.
The vehicle would include some assets from Athaang Infrastructure, which operates toll roads, according to one of the people, who declined to be identified because the information is private. The investment will be a private placement and the fund raising should take place by September, another person said.
NIIF
is India’s first major attempt to develop a capital-raising structure on home soil, to tackle a shortfall in infrastructure spending. Investors include Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Singapore’s
Temasek Holdings
Pte, according to its website.
Infrastructure investment trusts, known as InvIT for short, are like mutual funds and allow a pooling of assets for financing projects and can help make up the shortfall in investment.
A
World Bank
report last year estimated the country needs to spend $840 billion over the next 15 years on urban infrastructure.

""Similar to space exploration, we need to go deeper into the ocean and do research. We must be prepared to go much deeper and make India proud... Life in the ocean and life on the land are directly connected,"" Rijiju said at the event and called upon people to rededicate themselves on World Ocean Day to contribute in a much better way to humanity.
""We must build our future more secure and enrich ourselves with better knowledge systems, live with dignity and respect nature. God has been kind to us. Whatever has been gifted to us through nature must be preserved,"" the minister said. Rijiju, who earlier in the day launched a coastal cleaning drive at Besant Nagar here.
He said the initiative would send out a strong positive message that the government is concerned about the lives on land as well as the ocean. He called upon the NIOT scientists to showcase their research outcomes, as these are basically meant to benefit the people.
""Success stories should be told to people in a better and candid manner,"" he added. He regretted that the blue economy's contribution to the national GDP is less than 10 percent. ""We are underperforming. Smaller countries with shorter coastlines have larger contributions to their national economy. This means India will have to ensure that oceans do not remain as a vast potent canvas but utilise the resources in the best possible manner,"" he said.
Secretary of Ministry of Earth Sciences M Ravichandran, Director of NIOT G A Ramadoss, Rear Admiral of Indian Navy Ravi Kumar Dhingra, NSS volunteers as well as representatives of the Norwegian Embassy along with the public participated in the beach cleaning drive.

""So, while the government now will come out with policies to get public transport to most of the Indian cities, we will also ensure that this happens with electricity and not with diesel. Therefore, on public transport also you can look forward to a very large support from the government coming in.
""So that not only we will see the transition from diesel buses, but we will also see more and more of public transport, which is missing, and electric coming in,"" he said.

Penetration of EVs is happening at a faster pace in some Scandinavian and European countries, and now India is the country which really needs to move in this direction mainly because of its energy security concerns, he said.
India imports over 85 per cent of its crude requirement and also imports over 50 per cent of natural gas.
Considering the fact that a large number of the most polluted cities of the world are located in India, the country has no choice but to adopt more and more EVS, he noted.
""We really want to focus on driving this sector so that not only do we have electric cars, buses and two-wheelers on the road, but we also come up as a manufacturing hub for the world,"" he said, adding there has been good traction on EV buses and public transport, but there is a need to increase the pace.
He also pointed out that large players are there in the auto and auto components sector in India, so the only thing is the transition, which should be easy.
""We are very clear that (in the) two-wheelers...transition may be close to 100 per cent in the next 5-7 years and there is no reason why we can't do it,"" Kapoor said, adding shifting in the two-wheelers segment would help in reducing petrol consumption.
The price has to come down to a certain level as India is a very big market and the direct government subsidy can't take the sector beyond a certain point, he said.
The industry can suggest steps in the areas of taxation or policy reforms.
""We really need to concentrate"" also on the trucks segment and in the four-wheeler segment, I think the market will take off with some support from the government...there is a lot of interest from the consumers...We need more options in the market and price has to come down slightly,"" Kapoor added.
He suggested that the industry increase investments in the complete value chain of battery manufacturing.
Speaking at the event, Heavy Industries Secretary Kamran Rizvi said the Indian automobile industry's size is Rs 10 lakh crore and the country is number one in the two and three-wheeler segment and fourth in cars.
He said that all this is coming from internal combustion engines, but that is going to change in the coming years and the industry can become the top in the EV sector.
Rizvi also urged the industry to play a role in the vision of making India a developed nation by 2047.
He said that the industry can work on areas like making batteries light in weight.
""The government can play a role of catalyst,"" he said, adding ""The FAME scheme has been a matter of much debate and a lot of discussion...unfortunately, it is coming to an end in some time. The question is whether FAME has driven EV or EV was to happen inevitably"".
Talking about drivers that would help the adoption of EVs, Rizvi said climate change would push people to go for the transition.
""Whether there is a policy or not, citizens will demand it (EV). So, that is a big opportunity that we have,"" he said, adding that buying an EV would help in making the world a better place to live.
The total cost of ownership of an EV will give saving for whole life and the industry should hammer on this point while selling these vehicles.
""To make sure that the EV wave does not die out before it becomes a big wave, the government is there to support all of you. FAME is there, PLI (production linked incentive) scheme is there and the government is open to any new ideas,"" he said.
The government last month reduced the subsidy provided under the FAME-II (Faster Adoption of Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India) scheme applicable to electric two-wheelers registered on or after June 1, 2023.
The Heavy Industries Ministry notified the changes. For electric two-wheelers, the demand incentive will be Rs 10,000 per kWh. The cap on incentives for electric two-wheelers will be 15 per cent of the ex-factory price of vehicles from 40 per cent at present.
The FAME India scheme commenced on April 1, 2019, for a period of three years, which was further extended for a period of two years up to March 31, 2024.
Sulajja Firodia Motwani, Chair, Ficci Electric Vehicle Committee, suggested a FAME - III scheme for five years with reduced incentives per year.
She said that the sudden withdrawal of incentives would lead to a sudden increase in prices of EVs and the momentum built may be lost.
She also asked for the revision of the auto PLI scheme as it has ""extremely high"" qualifying criteria, besides cutting the GST rate to 5 per cent on batteries from 18 per cent at present.

Modi govt’s road dreams may take a backseat on cash flow and debt issues,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/modi-govts-road-dreams-may-take-a-backseat-on-cash-flow-and-debt-issues/articleshow/100784067.cms,06-06-2023,"If the recent trends of cashflow challenges and weak orders are anything to go by, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
's government’s thrust on road and highway projects will continue on a muted footing until the 2024 general elections.
A report by Nomura Research on Monday showed that the pace of highway awarding by state and central governments has been weak in the last financial year and also in April this calendar year. It may continue to be so in the ongoing fiscal, the foreign brokerage said.
The tenders awarded by the
Transport Ministry
(MoRTH) in FY23 fell to 12,376 km from 12,731 km in FY22, which however was higher than in FY20 and FY21.
That said, in April 2023, tenders for only 114 km tenders were awarded, which is down by 43 percent on an annual basis, and lowest since FY20.
“We note that the ordering of roads and highways had lost pace ahead of parliamentary elections in FY09, FY14 and FY19. In our view, FY24 is also likely to witness a similar trend,” said Nomura.

379 infra projects show cost overruns of Rs 4.64 lakh crore in April
National highway (NH) constructions in
India
reached a record high of 37 km per day in FY21 but slowed to 30.11 km per day in FY23 due to elevated commodity prices as well as prolonged monsoons.
The construction of NH in 2022-23 was 10,993 kilometres, falling 13.70 per cent short of the government's target of 12,500 km. The ministry awarded highways of 12,375 km in length in the last financial year.
Ahead of the general elections, the central government intends to accelerate the construction of roads in FY24 by 16-21 per cent, with a focus on execution of projects under various stages of execution,
ICRA
had said in a report earlier in May.
However, with the model of conduct deployed in Q4FY24 due to the elections, the awarding activity is expected to take a hit in FY24. ICRA expects an overall decline to 9,000-9,500 km from 12,375 km in FY23.
High inflation, high debt, lower orders
Owing to a sharp rise in the cost of land acquisition, Nomura says, the road projects have witnessed significant cost inflation. With the cost of all key raw materials elevated in comparison to pre-Covid levels, the cost of construction has also seen a sharp rise.
The prices of steel, cement, diesel and bitumen are 50 per cent, 14 per cent, 36 per cent and 46 per cent higher than the pre-COVID average, data shows.
Nomura estimates that the cost of the Bharatmala project is now perhaps over 2 times the original estimates by the
NHAI
.
The NHAI’s elevated debt levels coupled with rising project costs may further contribute to the slowdown in project slowdowns, the report said
Key road EPC companies too have seen a rise in net debt levels and a decline in operating
cash flow
.
“Amid a scenario of a potential slowdown in ordering which can limit the rise in earnings, debt levels may remain elevated, posing further risks to the sector,” Nomura said.

It also stated that the number of delayed projects decreases to 598 if delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion.

Out of the 800 delayed projects, 194 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 175 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 306 projects for 25-60 months and 125 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 800 delayed projects was 37.07 months.
Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in
land acquisition
, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delay in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to
COVID-19
(imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

The total expenditure as on 31st March 2023 was Rs 14,71,873.93 crore which works out to 55.98 per cent of the total anticipated completion cost and 68.06 per cent of the original cost.
For these 1,566 projects, a total outlay of Rs 2,81,251.99 crore has been allocated for 2022-23.
The
Quarterly Project Implementation Status Report
(QPISR) on
Central Sector Projects
(costing Rs 150 crore and above) for the 4th quarter of 2022-23 (January-March 2023), contains detailed information on 1,566 projects covering 443 mega projects (each costing Rs 1,000 crore and above) and 1,123 major projects (each costing Rs 150 crore and above but below Rs 1,000 crore).
Out of 1,566 projects, 12 projects were ahead of schedule, 292 projects were on schedule, 931 projects were delayed with respect to the original schedule of completion.
Further, it stated that for 331 projects, either original or the anticipated date of completion was not reported.
The percentage of delayed projects had changed from 41.27 per cent in quarter ending March 2022 to 59.45 per cent in quarter ending March 2023, it stated.
The percentage of cost overrun had changed from 21.43 per cent in quarter ending March 2022 to 21.59 per cent in quarter ending March 2023, it also stated.
The major factors responsible for time overruns as ported by project implementing agencies include environment, forest and wildlife clearances; land acquisition issues; state-wise lockdown due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021); contractual issues and shifting of utilities.
While the cost overruns due to general price escalation could not be avoided, the cost escalation on account of delay could be minimised, it suggested.

Similar improvement is seen in road projects as well since the rollout of NMP, officials aware of the development said.
All logistics and connectivity infrastructure projects in the country entailing investment of over ₹500 crore are routed through the
Network Planning Group
constituted under the PM
Gati
Shakti initiative.
Based on the master plan, detailed project report (DPR) for road infra projects is now done in about 15 days against six months earlier, officials said.

""Various projects are getting different kind of advantages in terms of cost and time saving, modal shift leading to reduction in carbon footprint, and faster DPR preparation,"" said Sumita Dawra, special secretary, DPIIT.
As per the analysis seen by ET, around 7,408 km of road infra projects have been planned on NMP.
Similarly, the master plan is being used for integrated planning of multi-modal terminals, which are expected to aid modal shift to waterways by 10-20%.
In the current logistics modal mix, road has around 60% share in freight movement.
Efficient economies' modal mix is 25-30% roads, 50-55% railway and 20-25% water, the commerce and industry ministry had said in a draft policy in 2020.
Till now, 79 projects worth ₹5.19 lakh crore have been evaluated on the NMP, comprising 34 of railway ministry, 25 of the road transport and highways ministry, and four of the petroleum and natural gas ministry.
As per the analysis, usage of NMP has increased rail electrification by 40%, automatic signalling by 144%, and sanction of station redevelopment by 49 times.
""There has been a reduction in forest area involved,"" Dawra said, adding that digital surveys have led to greater volume of feasibility reports.

"What is highway hypnosis, blamed for many fatal road accidents?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/what-is-highway-hypnosis-blamed-for-many-fatal-road-accidents/articleshow/100533093.cms,26-05-2023,"Road hypnosis
has been blamed for many accidents on highways across the world. Road hypnosis is a condition in which the eyes of the driver are open but brain does not record and analyse what the eyes see. But many drivers are not aware of this condition. According to healthcare professionals, such a condition usually happens when one is on a long drive, especially through straight roads. It is usually caused when a person is driving on highway having monotonous scenery, no traffic light and little traffic
Recently, a Maharashtra state highway police attributed some of the accidents on first phase of
Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Expressway
to
highway hypnosis
. A total of 39 persons have lost their lives and 143 were injured in accidents on the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Expressway since its launch in December 2022 till the end of April this year, according to officials. According to a Times of India report, highway officials plan to put up billboards, signages, posers, message board along the Samruddhi Expressway to keep drivers engaged through positive distractions which would not let them slip into highway hypnosis.
“Highway hypnosis lessens focus, and concentration leading to accidents,"" says an official.
What does highway hypnosis feel like
According to the website of TATA AIG, which offers auto insurance, ""Highway hypnosis occurs when individuals zone out while driving a vehicle, often travelling a significant distance without recollecting it. Experiencing highway hypnosis can zone out drivers for hundreds of miles or short distances.""

In case you abruptly realise that you have no memory of the last eight miles you drove, says TATA AIG website, ""you probably were under the influence of highway hypnosis. Another sign that indicates experiencing highway hypnosis is noticing yourself drifting into the rumble strip or moving onto the next lane.""
How to prevent highway hypnosis
Experts advise against driving continuously without breaks or driving for long hours without proper sleep/rest. They advise drivers to take breaks every 2-3 hours, take walks during the break and have tea/food or talk to someone.

Finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
had said while presenting the budget for 2023-24 that there was a need for re-assessing the scope and comprehensiveness of infrastructure definition and the infrastructure financing framework.
ET Bureau
""Infrastructure is a catalyst for sustainable and productive economic growth. Infrastructure spending not only increases creation and upgradation of national assets, but also has a high multiplier effect in terms of employment generation, industrial and ancillary growth and socio-economic development,"" the ministry said in its memorandum.
The
Rangarajan Committee
under the
National Statistical Commission
had defined the term 'infrastructure' following which in 2012 the 'harmonised master list (
HML
) of infrastructure' was created based on the Rangarajan framework.
The government is of the view that since the adoption of HML in 2012, the economic conditions around the world have considerably changed, and the sectoral mix that constitutes 'infrastructure' has significantly altered.
""This necessitates a relook at the definition of 'infrastructure' to reflect the current economic realities, as well as, understand ways in which infrastructure can be best financed to attract more investments into the infrastructure sector,"" the ministry said.
The committee is expected to review the existing framework's underlying principles of defining infrastructure under the HML.

Changes in the works for surety bonds to make them lucrative: Nitin Gadkari,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/changes-in-the-works-for-surety-bonds-to-make-them-lucrative-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/100454105.cms,23-05-2023,"Changes will be made to the
surety
bond offering in road making contracts to make it more lucrative said
Road Transport
and Highways Minister
Nitin Gadkari
. Speaking at a CareEdge Ratings event in Delhi, he said the present surety bond offering has found no takers and tweaks are in the works.
“It took us three years to introduce the Insurance Surety Bond
product
after following up with regulatory authorities. The bond can be offered in place of a
bank
guarantee. But they have made the product so restrictive that no contractor can avail it,” Gadkari said.
Insurance Surety bonds can be used as a substitute for bank guarantees in government
procurement
tenders. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had issued guidelines for these bonds and allowed their issuance from April 1, 2022. IRDAI’s guidelines have listed six types of Surety Contracts. These contracts are being viewed as essential for meeting the infrastructure development goals of the country.
In April 2022, the centre had said that these bonds will be accepted as a substitute for bank guarantee in government procurements. This was done with the intent to reduce indirect cost for suppliers and work-contractors.
It is estimated that banks seek close to 30-50 percent of cash money margin (from smaller construction companies), which is then stuck in the bank guarantees. To address these concerns, Gadkari oversaw the launch of India’s first Surety bonds product, offered by Bajaj Alliance, in December 2022.

Highlighting how there is a need to balance regulation, Gadkari said, “We need to find a breaking point where there is no compromise on quality but the scheme needs to be implementable. Idealistic scenarios are not helpful.”
“Technical and financial consultants need to exactly find this breaking point on priority while keeping in mind performance
audit
and timelines,” he added.

"GIC may invest Rs 1,500 crore in IRB InvIT to fund Hyderabad Ring Road project buy",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/gic-may-invest-rs-1500-crore-in-irb-invit-to-fund-hyderabad-ring-road-project-buy/articleshow/100364519.cms,20-05-2023,"Singapore's sovereign wealth fund
GIC
is evaluating an investment of ₹1,500 crore into
IRB Infrastructure
Trust, an infrastructure investment trust (
InvIT
) sponsored by construction firm
IRB Infrastructure Developers
, said two people aware of the development.
GIC
is an existing shareholder of IRB Infrastructure Trust.
The proposed investment will be used to fund the acquisition of the
Hyderabad Outer Ring Road
(ORR) project, which the IRB group successfully bid for under the
toll-operate-transfer
(TOT) monetisation plan for a sum of ₹7,380 crore for a concession period of 30 km in April. This is the second biggest
TOT
asset to be acquired by IRB following the acquisition of Mumbai-Pune Expressway project in February 2020 for a sum of ₹8,262 crore. IRB has an asset base of over ₹70,000 crore across the parent company and two InvITs.
""GIC is evaluating the ORR project that IRB has successfully won under the TOT auction process. If GIC decides to join IRB in the acquisition of the road project then the project will be acquired through the InvIT, where GIC holds a 49% stake. Discussions between the two parties are ongoing,"" said one of the persons.
The Hyderabad ORR is a 158 km, eight-lane ring road expressway encircling Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana. Opened in December 2012, a large part of around 124 km of ORR covers urban nodes like Hi-Tech City, Nanakramguda Financial District, International Airport, IKP Knowledge Park, Hardware Park, Telangana State Police Academy, Singapore Financial District and Game Village.
The purchase of the ORR project for ₹7,380 crore includes an equity value of ₹3,000 crore, which if done through the InvIT will see GIC and IRB invest roughly around ₹1,500 crore each into the InvIT, said the second source. ""The road generates toll revenue of around ₹640 crore annually,"" he added. IRB Infrastructure Developers declined to comment on ET's query, while an email sent to GIC remained unanswered till press time. GIC first invested in the IRB Infrastructure Trust in August 2019, when it wrote a cheque of ₹4,400 crore for a portfolio of nine toll roads.

new cities
to alleviate population burden on the existing urban centres in the country is under consideration, a senior official said here on Thursday. The 15th
Finance Commission
in one of its reports had recommended that new cities should be developed, said
M B Singh
, director of the
G20
unit of the
Union Housing and Urban Affairs Department
.
Singh was speaking to PTI on the sidelines of a meeting of 'Urban 20 (U20)' in Indore.
""After the finance commission's recommendation, the states sent proposals to the Central Government for 26 new cities, and after a scrutiny, eight new cities are being considered for development,"" he said.
The government will in due course announce locations for the new cities and their development timelines, he added.
""We have to build new cities in the country as the existing cities are not able to cater to the needs of citizens. Haphazard expansion on the outskirts of existing cities is affecting the basic planning of these cities,"" Singh said.

NaBFID will lend into this pipeline, to a mix of greenfield and brownfield projects, while also participating in the monetisation of operational infrastructure assets, said Rai.
The federal government has put in 200 billion rupees, as initial capital, into NaBFID, which the institution will leverage. But, it intends to finance its lending via a mix of long-term bonds and bank loans.
NaBFID will raise about 300 billion through bond sales this financial year, with the first issue, of between 50-100 billion rupees, likely to hit the market in June, said Rai.
""Compared to earlier years, when infrastructure financiers struggled to raise funds from the bond market, the size of the
insurance
and pension
fund
market has grown, and these entities are looking to invest in long-term bonds,"" said Rai.
NaBFID will also raise funds from banks as needed and, over time, tap multi-lateral institutions, he said.

Delhi-Varanasi has already been connected by expressway via Purvanchal, Lucknow-Agra and Yamuna expressways, reducing the travel time between the two cities considerably. It is now possible to make the Delhi-Varanasi journey in little over 10 hours.
Times of India, citing officials, reported that the Varanasi-Kolkata expressway is expected to be ready by 2026. And once completed, you can make the Delhi=Kolkata journey in 17 hours, the same time currently taken in Rajdhani trains. The alignment of the highway was finalised in September 2021.
The proposed greenfield Kolkata-Ranchi-Varanasi highway (4/6 lane) will pass through Uttar Pradesh ,Bihar Jharkhand and West Bengal. The access controlled will connect Varanasi Ring Road (near Barhuli village) and Uluberia, West Bengal, under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. The proposed expressway will connect Mohania, Rohtas, Sasaram, Aurangabad, Gaya, Chatra, Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Bokaro, Dhanbad, Ramgarh, Purulia, Bankura, Paschim Medinipur, Hooghly and Howrah.
Bharatmala Pariyojana is India's largest infrastructure programme and aims to develop about 35,000 km of National Highway corridors, connecting over 580 districts in the nation.

India a priority market in Asia for Mubadala: Khaled Abdulla Al Qubaisi,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/india-a-priority-market-in-asia-for-mubadala-khaled-abdulla-al-qubaisi/articleshow/100234657.cms,15-05-2023,"Abu Dhabi's state investment firm
Mubadala
Investment Co, which has so far invested $4 billion in India through direct and indirect investments, sees India as a priority market for its investments in Asia, especially in the infrastructure sector, said
Khaled Abdulla Al Qubaisi
, CEO, Real Estate and Infrastructure Investments at Mubadala in an exclusive interaction with ET.
Of the total Investments by Mubadala till date, Real Estate and Infrastructure Investments portfolio stands at $1.6 billion. This includes a $1.2 billion investment in Jio Platforms and investments in
Tata Power Renewables and Cube
Highways' infrastructure investment trust.
A major backer of the
Softbank Vision Fund
with a $15 billion commitment, Mubadala manages assets worth approximately $284 billion. The investment firm was created in 2017 with the merger of two other state firms - International Petroleum Investment Company and Mubadala Development Company. In 2018, Abu Dhabi Investment Council was added to Mubadala making it the second largest sovereign fund of Abu Dhabi and the third largest in UAE.
""India is a priority market for us in Asia. Mubadala is really serious about deploying more in India and to increase our weight allocation and portfolio in India, because right now it's below India's GDP share of global GDP. And I think we should be at least neutral if not even overweight in India,"" said Qubaisi.
Live Events
""Where we are focusing on are things that positively impact people, improve life of people in India, whether it's telecommunication, digital transformation and infrastructure,"" he added.
Within infrastructure, Mubadala is focusing on areas such as renewable energy and roads.
""We believe in India's future potential in energy and in renewable energy specifically, and we have high hopes and aspirations to invest even more in that area going forward. We are looking at this sector and as a fastest growing energy market and economy in the world, we want help support energy transition in the country and also be part of that growth,"" said Qubaisi, adding that highways is another big area of interest for Mubadala.
""It's important for India to build up its infrastructure and highways are a core part of that infrastructure.""
Qubaisi believes that these sectors alone can take billions and billions of dollars of capital, given how large India is and the growth Mubadala sees in the Indian economy. ""These sectors alone will keep us busy for many years to come,"" he said.
Apart from renewables and roads, Mubadala is also looking at other investment opportunities such as city gas networks.
Economic Times reported on 12 May that Mubadala and some Japanese investors are in talks to pick up a minority stake in I
Squared Capital
's city gas distribution businesses in India at a valuation of around $1 billion.
Mubadala's investment strategy in India will focus on finding and backing the right partners.

NSA Ajit Doval in secret talks in Saudi Arabia to shape a counter to China,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/nsa-ajit-doval-in-secret-talks-in-saudi-arabia-to-shape-a-counter-to-china/articleshow/100078721.cms,08-05-2023,"India's National Security Advisor
Ajit Doval
has met his American counterpart Jake Sullivan and those from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to discuss an ambitious infrastructure project that will counter China's efforts to expand its footprint through
Belt and Road
Initiative (
BRI
).
The four leaders had a meeting in Saudi Arabia yesterday.
Doval
and Sullivan will meet again later this month on the sidelines of the Quad Summit in Australia.
The exact details of the meeting were not revealed, though in an anodyne statement yesterday, the White House said, ""National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Saudi Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, UAE National Security Advisor Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and National Security Advisor of India Ajit Doval on May 7 in Saudi Arabia to advance their shared vision of a more secure and prosperous Middle East region interconnected with India and the world.""
An American news website had revealed that an ambitious infrastructure project was on the agenda of the meeting.
US, Saudi, Emirati and Indian national security advisers were expected to discuss a possible major joint infrastructure project to connect Gulf and Arab countries via a network of railways that would also be connected to India via shipping lanes from ports in the region, Axios reported later last week, citing sources with direct knowledge of the plan.
Live Events
Why is this infrastructure project important?
The idea is to link Arab countries with a vast railway network which would connect through seaports with India. The project will leverage India's expertise in building railway networks. This will not only boost trade between West and South Asia but also serve as a counter to China's BRI which is a sprawling network of rail, road and sea routes which connect dozens of countries in several continents to China. thus giving China opportunities to trade with BRI countries as well as advance its strategic and diplomatic agendas.
The new initiative came up during talks that were held over the last 18 months in another forum called I2U2, which includes the U.S., Israel, the UAE and India. The forum was established in late 2021 to discuss strategic infrastructure projects in the Middle East. “Nobody said it out loud but it was about China from day one,"" a former senior Israeli official who was directly involved in early discussions on the issue told Axios. Israel raised the idea of connecting the region through railways during the I2U2 meetings over the last year. Part of the idea was to use India’s expertise on such big infrastructure projects.
China has stepped up its cooperation with West Asia, particularly with Iraq, since the unveiling of the BRI. Iraq's strategic location and its trade through the Persian Gulf make it a crucial point in China's BRI. China's insatiable hunger for energy resources places a high priority on importing energy from West Asia. China is pushing hard to expand its footprints across the West Asia North Africa region riding on the atmosphere created by the Saudi-Iran deal that was brokered by it. There has been a flurry of visits from China across the region since the deal was concluded.
Sullivan hinted at this initiative during his speech on Thursday at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy: “If you remember nothing else from my speech, remember I2U2, because you will be hearing more about it as we go forward,"" he said. Sullivan added the fundamental notion is to connect South Asia to the Middle East to the U.S. “in ways that advance our economic technology and diplomacy.""
""A more integrated, interconnected Middle East empowers our allies and partners, advances regional peace and prosperity, and reduces the resource demands on the U.S. in this region over the long term without sacrificing our fundamental interests or our involvement in the region,"" he said.
India's partnership in this project will help the country achieve better connectivity and cheaper transport costs with a region where a large number of Indian immigrants go to work and from where India usually imports most of its oil. It will also boost India's reputation as a global builder of infrastructure because India is supposed to construct the railway routes. Increased connectivity and economic cooperation with the countries in West Asia will also strengthen India's diplomatic ties with those countries and open up prospects for cooperation in other areas too.
At a later stage, Axios reported, Israel too can be invited to join this project.

However, the pace of road construction slowed down since then. NH constructions in India reached a record high of 37 km per day in FY21 but slowed to 30.11 km per day in FY23.
“The execution was impacted in H1FY23, on account of elevated commodity prices as well as prolonged monsoons in certain geographies, which affected the productive day,” said Kumar. “The situation improved in H2 FY2023 with road construction witnessing a YoY growth of 2%, thereby containing the overall decline at 1% in FY23 (to 10,331 km from 10,457 km in FY22),” he added.
The current project pipeline remains at 55,000 km under various stages of execution. ICRA expects this, along with a focus on completing projects ahead of the general elections to boos execution to 12,000-12,500 km in FY24.
However, with the model of conduct deployed in Q4FY24 due to the elections, the awarding activity is expected to take a hit in FY24. ICRA expects an overall decline to 9,000-9,500 km from 12,375 km in FY23.

trust
(InvIT), has approved a proposal to raise Rs 4,320 crore from Canadian pension investors, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS).
ET first reported on April 15 that CPPIB and OMERS, two of the biggest shareholders of Indinfravit are planning to infuse around Rs4300 crore into the InvIT to
fund
the
acquisition
of a
portfolio
of five road assets from Brookfield at an enterprise valuation of $1.2 billion.
In a regulatory filing, Indinfravit said that it's board, at a meeting held on 25 April, has passed a proposal to raise funds through a
preferential allotment
of units to CPPIB and OMERS.
As per the filing by Indinfravit, CPPIB will be issued 328.74 million units at a price of Rs101 per unit, for a cash consideration of Rs3320.29 crore, while OMERS will be alloted 99 million shares, for a consideration of Rs 999.90 crore.
The fundraising is subject to approval from Indinfravit unitholders.
Live Events
The Brookfield portfolio that Indinfravit is acquiring comprises three toll road projects - Mumbai Nasik Expressway, Simhapuri Expressway and Rayalseema Expressway - while the other two road assets are annuity projects - Gorakhpur Infrastructure Company and Kosi Bridge Infrastructure Company
The roads portfolio with approximately 2,400 lane kms is spread across the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. The portfolio has been operational, on an average, for approximately nine years, and has an average residual concession period of 20 years.
IndInfravit’s existing portfolio includes thirteen operational road concessions with approx. 5,000 lane kms spread across five states. The portfolio generated a
revenue
of Rs1,742 crore in FY22, compared to a revenue of Rs1,576 crore in the previous financial year.
Indinfravit, originally sponsored by India's largest construction company Larsen & Toubro Ltd has over time become CPPIB's primary operating roads platform in India. CPPIB was an anchor investor of the InvIT when it was set up in 2018.
L&T has sold down its stake, which it held through L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd (L&T IDPL), in the InvIT in multiple tranches. The last stake
sale
on 28 February, saw L&T sell 6.05% stake to CPPIB, marking its exit from the InvIT.
In 2021, CPPIB consolidated its shareholding in Indinfravit by acquiring 8.9% stake from L&T IDPL and a 7% stake from
Sadbhav Infrastructure Project
for a total consideration of Rs1,005 crore.
CPPIB is the biggest shareholder of Indinfravit with 49.9% shareholding, while OMERS stake stands at 20.03%. Allianz Capital is the other big shareholder of Indinfravit with a 22.7% stake.
The proposed funding will take CPPIB’s stake to around 60%, while OMERS will likely become the second biggest shareholder of Indinfravit.
The Brookfield portfolio is the second big road portfolio that Indinfravit is acquiring since its formation. While the initial set of roads came from L&T IDPL, in March 2020 Indinfravit bought a portfolio of nine operating roads from Gujarat based Sadbhav Infrastructure for an enterprise value of Rs6,300 crore.

National Highways
- the country's arteries - being added in the last 9 years, according to official data.
India
had a total of 97,830 km of National Highways in 2014-15 which has been expanded to 145,155 km by March 2023.
From building 12.1 km per day of roads in 2014-15, the nation is seeing 28.6 km of roads being constructed every day in 2021-22, according to the official data.
Roads and highways play a crucial role in a nation's economy.
Road transport
is the basis of not only economic development but also social development, defence sectors, and access to basic things for life. According to a report, about 85 per cent of passenger and 70 per cent of goods traffic is carried by roads every year, this gives us an idea of its importance.
India has about 63.73 lakh km of the road network, which is the second largest in the world.
National Highways play a very important role in the economic and social development of the country by enabling efficient movement of freight and passengers, connecting people and facilitating economic activities.

has implemented multiple initiatives in the last 9 years to augment the capacity of the
National Highway
infrastructure in the country.
The pace of National Highways (NH) construction has increased consistently between 2014-15 and 2021-22 due to the systematic push through corridor-based National Highway development approach. In 2014-15, the pace of NH construction was about 12 km/ day, which increased to about 29 km/ day in 2021-22, the data showed.
As a part of
Bharatmala Pariyojana
, India's largest expressway, i.e., 1,386 km long Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, is being developed, and
Delhi
- Dausa - Lalsot section of the expressway has already been dedicated to the nation by
PM Modi

"MoRTH plans to raise Rs 35,000 crore through asset monetisation this fiscal: Official",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/morth-plans-to-raise-rs-35000-crore-through-asset-monetisation-this-fiscal-official/articleshow/99704541.cms,23-04-2023,"The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) plans to raise Rs 35,000 crore through various modes of asset monetisation in this financial year, against Rs 32,855-crore target in the last fiscal, a senior government official said on Sunday. Currently,
MoRTH
monetises its assets under three different modes viz
toll-operate-transfer
(TOT) model,
Infrastructure Investment Trust
(InvIT) and project-based financing, in order to provide all categories of investors an opportunity to invest in assets pertaining to highways and associated infrastructure.
Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) is an instrument on the pattern of mutual funds, designed to pool money from investors and invest in assets that will provide cash flows over a period of time.
Elaborating further, the official told PTI that while Rs 15,000 crore is planned to be raised in 2023-24 via project-based financing of high-speed corridors by securitising the future toll revenues without any guidance from the authority, Rs 10,000 is planned to be raised via InvIT.
He also said that MoRTH is planning to raise Rs 10,000 crore in 2023-24 via ToT.
According to the official, in the last four years, MoRTH has already raised Rs 67,997 crore through various modes of asset monetisation till February 28, 2023.

Out of the 821 delayed projects, 190 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 177 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 325 projects for 25-60 months and 129 projects have been delayed for more than 60 months.
The average time overrun in these 821 delayed projects was 37.79 months.
Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and
environment
clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.
Delay in tie-up for project financing, finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems were among the other reasons.
The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 (imposed in 2020 and 2021) as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.
It has also been observed that project executing agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

KKR and Sekura among companies in fray for Ashoka's road assets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/kkr-and-sekura-among-companies-in-fray-for-ashokas-road-assets/articleshow/99649113.cms,23-04-2023,"Private equity firm
KKR
, Edelweiss-owned
Sekura
, I Squared Capital’s Cube Highways and
Shrem InvIT
are in a race to acquire a portfolio of 11
hybrid annuity model
(HAM) road projects of a subsidiary of
Ashoka Buildcon
, said two people aware of the development.
“While many HAM assets are on sale in the market, they are small two-three asset portfolios. Ashoka's portfolio is one of the biggest HAM portfolios available and hence it has evinced interest from multiple players such as KKR,
Edelweiss
, Cube as well as Shrem,” said one of the people.
The portfolio held by
Ashoka Concessions
Ltd is expected to fetch an enterprise value of close to Rs5,500 crore with an equity value of up to Rs1,300 crore, he said. EY is advising Ashoka Buildcon on the sale process.
Of the 11 roads, seven are operational and four are under construction. Ashoka holds 100% stake in all these projects, spread across the states of Punjab, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat.
The operational road projects are Kharar-Ludhiana, Ranastalam-Anandpuram, Vadodara Kim, Khairatunda-Barwa Adda, Belgaum-Khanapur, Tumkur-Shivamogga –I, Kandi-Ramsanpalle.
Live Events
As on December 31, five of these roads collectively generated annuity revenue of Rs676 crore, as per an investor presentation by the company.
The four under construction projects are Tumkur-Shivamogga–II, III and IV, and Basawantpur Singnodi.
Mails sent to Ashoka Concessions, KKR, Sekura, Cube Highways and Shrem InvIT did not elicit any responses till the press time.
The sale of the 11 HAM road assets follows other monetisation deals by Ashoka for multiple toll road projects.
In December 2021, Ashoka entered into an agreement to sell five toll roads housed under Ashoka Concessions to KKR for Rs1,337 crore. The transaction is yet to be closed. Of the sale proceeds, Rs1,200 crore would be used to provide a complete exit to
SBI
Macquarie from the Ashoka Concessions platform.
The sale of these five roads will reduce the consolidated project debt of Ashoka Buildcon by Rs2,833 crore, the company said in its last investor call.
Ashoka is also engaged in the process of selling its stakes in the Jaora-Nayagaon BOT road project and the Chennai Outer Ring Road, for a consideration of Rs691 crore and Rs686 crore, respectively, to the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
KKR, Cube Highways and Edelweiss’ Sekura are among the most active buyers of road assets in India.
KKR entered into the Indian road sector in 2021 by acquiring Highway Concessions One and seven highway assets with a total length of 487 kilometres from Global Infrastructure Partners. It set up an infrastructure investment trust, Highways Infrastructure Trust, in 2022. It also acquired Hyderabad-based Navayuga group's toll road - Navayuga Udupi Tollway – at an enterprise value of Rs 924 crore.
Last year, Cube Highways acquired five HAM highway projects from Gurgaon-based KCC Buildcon, including one operational asset -a highway section on NH 66 between Talgaon and Kalmath in Maharashtra.
In HAM contracts, the central government contributes 40% to the equity in the projects and the developer arranges the remaining fund through a mix of debt and equity.
Notwithstanding the benefits of HAM, awards under this mode have had their share of challenges, said a 2022 Crisil report. Only 56% of projects awarded over fiscals 2016 to 2018 have been completed, while 37% are still under construction. Of the HAM awards in fiscals 2019 and 2020, 90% are still under construction, it added.
""Nowadays, financial investors prefer toll assets as they are inflation-hedged and offer better returns,"" said a Mumbai-based investment banker. Lower equity returns and the increasing interest rate environment make HAM projects less attractive for investors, he added.

The
National Highways Authority of India
(NHAI) and National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) are primarily responsible for the construction of national highways and expressways in India.
Asked whether the government would raise more money via the InviT route, Upadhyaya said MoRTH has leveraged various innovative ways of funding its infrastructure projects by involving the private sector in highway construction.
""Till February 28, 2023, Rs 10,200 crore has been raised through InvIT in two phases, for a total length of 635 km, while InvIT III is planned to be awarded in April 2023 for a total of Rs 10,000 crore.
""Additionally, Rs 10,000 crore is planned to be raised through InvIT mode in FY 2023-24,"" she said.
Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) is an instrument on the pattern of mutual funds, designed to pool money from investors and invest in assets that will provide cash flows over a period of time.
Currently, MoRTH monetises its assets under three different modes viz toll-operate-transfer (
TOT
) model, InvIT and project-based financing, in order to provide all categories of investors an opportunity to invest in assets pertaining to highways and associated infrastructure.
Asked if MoRTH is planning to issue guidelines for signage and road marking to deal with blatant violations of lane driving, she said the ministry has already started piloting signage and road marking in line with best-in-class signage standards in the world on greenfield highway corridors.
While pointing out that signages and road markings being installed in the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway are in line with the global best practices, Upadhyaya said that an extensive exercise was carried out to finalise the standards for signages and road marking on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway based on global best-in-class practices.
""Going forward, MoRTH plans to adopt these standards in all high-speed corridors to start with, (and) subsequently on all national highway corridors,"" she said.

Who’ll finance Indian infrastructure after the Adani scandal?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/wholl-finance-indian-infrastructure-after-the-adani-scandal/articleshow/99450418.cms,13-04-2023,"As the
Adani Group
grapples with uncomfortable scrutiny, there’s a palpable nervousness in India about what will happen next. In just over a quarter-century, the once-modest commodity trader from Ahmedabad has morphed into the country’s largest infrastructure player, a debt-fueled behemoth overseeing a dazzling array of hard assets at home, as well as in Australia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Israel.
Allegations that billionaire Gautam
Adani
has benefited from his proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi — strenuously denied by the group — are being raised relentlessly by the Congress Party’s Rahul Gandhi and other opposition leaders in a bid to shake Modi’s seemingly ironclad grip on power in the lead up to next year’s national elections.
All that’s happening largely in New Delhi, India’s political capital. The big question in India’s financial capital of Mumbai, however, is more forward-looking. How will the country fill the gaping holes in its infrastructure if the sector — already plagued by chronic low profitability — loses access to much-needed global financing in the aftermath of the Adani scandal?
It’s been nearly two months since New York-based
Hindenburg
Research accused the Indian businessman of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud.” Although the group responded with a 413-page rebuttal, and Florida-based emerging-market investor GQG Partners Inc. bought almost $2 billion of its stock, the market value of Adani firms is still more than $100 billion lower than before the short-seller’s report. The Indian Supreme Court has set up a six-member committee to probe the allegations.
Adani is a gigantic asset owner, in control of a number of ports, airports, coal mines, power stations, transmission lines, city-gas networks, solar farms, roads, and data centers. He stepped into a breach. Domestic institutions, such as the
Life Insurance Corporation of India
, are simply not wired to own stuff that produces steady cash flows. So scared has
LIC
been of the country’s Rent Control Act of 1948 that it hasn’t liked to buy tenanted buildings in the past — only vacant ones.
Live Events
Toll roads, which earn a steady revenue stream for up to 30 years, would also be a suitable asset class for a life insurer with long-term liabilities. Except that Indian insurance firms don’t have the mandate to invest directly in specially created private-limited firms in which concessionaires typically house their highways. No such rules apply to the likes of New York Life Insurance Co., which recently picked up a 49% stake in such a firm developing a commercial
property
on the outskirts of New Delhi.
If patient, long-term money plays a more active role in the nation’s economy, entrepreneurs like Adani would have no option except to concentrate on building new ports and airports rather than bloating their balance sheets with pre-existing ones. Sheer competitive logic will ensure that financial institutions with low cost of capital and long-term charters emerge as asset-owners.
Diffused ownership would also help depoliticize the sector. The state-controlled LIC finds itself in the hot seat for its $4 billion
equity
and debt exposure to Adani when other local institutions like mutual funds were largely sitting out the five-year, 2,500% rally in the group’s flagship firm. There would be far fewer questions about its conduct if, instead of backing a controversial tycoon, the insurer got behind actual cash-generating assets — both at the project level and when they’re bunched together into investment trusts, as rent-earning bouquets.
Project execution requires entrepreneurial hustle. Asset ownership needs balance-sheet strength. Separating the two will depend crucially on political will. The historically incestuous relationship between India’s big business and government, made worse by the opaque electoral bonds introduced in 2018 by Modi’s party, will have to change radically. If politicians do pull off a clean break (even though it’s against their own interest), the next step may be to prepare the groundwork for an alternative-asset industry.
Prominent Mumbai financiers like Srini Sriniwasan and Rashesh Shah are doing just that. Sriniwasan, a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s now-terminated joint venture with
Kotak Mahindra Bank
, helped set up Kotak Investment Advisors, an alternative-asset firm with $8.8 billion in assets under management across real-estate funds, private equity, private credit, infrastructure and data centers. Shah’s
Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd
. has deployed $1 billion-plus of equity across alternative and distressed assets, insurance, nonbank lending and mortgages, mutual funds and wealth management. Having sold a majority stake in its wealth unit to Hong Kong’s PAG in 2020,
Edelweiss
is now a lean investment company with just 48 employees.
For both Sriniwasan and Shah, the goal is to assemble large, patient pools of capital in which investors will share the risk. This is a far better model for funding long-duration assets than using bank deposits maturing in a couple of years — or, for that matter, deploying mutual-fund money that can get pulled at a minute’s notice. In recent years, India has seen disastrous consequences of both.
In the absence of the right kind of homegrown capital, foreign money is calling the shots. The Canadian public pension fund, known as PSP Investments, as well as Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, or CPPIB, and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, or CDPQ, have aggressively plucked high-yielding opportunities. Canadian pensioners are relying on India for a better retirement.
Meanwhile, workers in the world’s fifth-largest economy may have to
put
up with bad infrastructure for another generation because the institutions to which they’re making provident-fund and insurance-premium contributions aren’t ready to be asset-owners. “Once all the risk of building an asset is in the rear-view mirror and cash generation starts, we happily enable retirees in the West to collect annuity incomes on the tolls we pay,” Sriniwasan told me recently in Mumbai.
When it comes to infrastructure, India’s 1.4 billion people have only ever known two alternatives: Either the resource-starved government will under-supply, or the private entrepreneur will overcharge. The notion that financial institutions can utilize an individual’s own future wealth to give her a better life at an affordable cost is yet to take hold. And that’s the main reason why infrastructure in the country is such a cesspool of intrigue.

"Tenders for all weather Mughal road, Amarnath Marg in Kashmir to be floated this year: Nitin Gadkari",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/tenders-for-all-weather-mughal-road-amarnath-marg-in-kashmir-to-be-floated-this-year-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/99392941.cms,11-04-2023,"Union Minister for
Road Transport
and Highways,
Nitin Gadkari
on Monday inspected and reviewed the progress of the work on Z-Morh tunnel and
Zojila tunnel
in Sonamarg area on Srinagar-Leh highway stating that the completion of these projects will fulfil the dream of
Kashmir
to Kanyakumari connectivity.
The minister informed that the work on 6.5 kms long Z-Morh tunnel that connects Gagangir and Sonamarg on the Srinagar-Leh highway in Ganderbal district of central Kashmir is 75 percent complete and is likely to thrown partly open in October this year, which will ensure that the Sonamarg does not get disconnected due to snowfall in the next winters.
Gadkari, while reviewing the progress of 13.14 kms long Zojila tunnel, which is the Asia’s longest tunnel that connects Sonamarg with the Kargil in Ladakh, said that 38 percent work on this project is complete and the government will try to ensure the completion of work before the 2026 deadline.
The minister also announced that the tenders for 110 km long Amarnath Marg–leading to the holy Amarnath cave in Pahalgam of southern Kashmir–will be issued in July and October, with the cost of around Rs 5300 crore.
He said that the tenders for tunnels on the historic
Mughal road
connecting Poonch in Jammu with Shopian in Kashmir will also be announced this year which will ensure round the year connectivity on this road.
Live Events
“This is the life line for J&K and Ladakh and will fulfil our imagination of Kashmir to Kanyakumari connectivity…National and international tourists rush will increase four times when these projects are complete and we will make this region better than Switzerland,” said Gadkari. He said that the tunnels will end the suffering of people in winters and they won't need to stock material for winter months. The minister said that when the projects are complete the Prime Minister will come for inaugurations.
“The area of the Z-Morh tunnel is strategically important…it will promote social and economic development in the entire region. It will promote tourism in Sonamarg including activities like whitewater rafting on Thajiwas Glacier and Sindh River,” Gadkari said. With the construction of this Zojila tunnel by Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited there will be all-weather connectivity for Ladakh and the average travel time to cross the Zojila Pass will reduce from three hours to 20.0 minutes. “This tunnel will provide year-round connectivity between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh, which will be extremely important for the development of Ladakh, promotion of tourism, free movement of local goods and movement of Indian armed forces in case of emergency,” he said.
The Union minister said that developmental works worth Rs 1,25,000 crore are being taken up by his ministry in J&K and since 2014, around 500 km of road network has been completed in the region. He informed that 41 significant tunnels are being constructed in J&K and Ladakh at a cost of Rs 45,000 crore. Also, 18 ropeways worth Rs 5,000 crore will be constructed in the UT.
The minister also informed that for the journey between Jammu and Srinagar three corridors worth Rs 35,000 crores are being constructed, which will reduce the earlier distance of 320 kms by 70 kms and time travel will be reduced from ten hours to four to five hours. The ministers said that a new 78 km four-lane ring road is being constructed in Srinagar at a cost of Rs 4,660 crores as well.

The analysis does not include data from Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, and north-eastern states, except Assam, hilly areas and Union territories.
Further analysis shows that spending has become more concentrated. The largest three states will account for nearly half of the expenditure by 16 states between 2021-22 and 2023-24, up from 45.7% between 2013-14 and 2015-16.
Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat will spend the highest on road infrastructure this fiscal.
An ET analysis showed that states' spending on roads and bridges as a proportion of GSDP has remained static at around 0.5% for the past decade. The Centre's spending on roads and bridges is expected to increase 4.3 times from a meagre 0.2% of the GDP in 2015-16.
In absolute terms, the Centre's capital expenditure on roads has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 32.3% since 2015-16, whereas the growth in states has been just 11.2%.
Experts highlighted that fiscal constraints, revenue expenditure and focus on the agricultural economy may be a cause for states spending less on roads and bridges, despite such infrastructure investments having a larger multiplier effect. ""States do not have the money; they are more constrained by the
fiscal deficit
number under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. They cannot compromise on revenue expenditure either,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist,
Bank of Baroda
.
States tend to spend more on infrastructure for the rural sector, agriculture and irrigation, said Sabnavis. ""Spending on roads and bridges is not a priority,"" he said.
""States are reluctant to utilise all the permitted borrowing, as they are reluctant to increase fiscal deficit,"" said DK Srivastava, chief policy adviser, EY India.
Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, senior director - consulting,
CRISIL
Market Intelligence and Analytics, said the reclassification of roads is also a cause for lower spending. ""Over time state highways get handed over to NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) and they get converted to NHs - increase in traffic being one of the key considerations. In this way the expenses of converting a state highway to national highway lies with the NHAI and the maintenance cost also gets transferred to the NHAI.""

Zojila tunnel
- an all-weather connection between the
Kashmir valley
and the
Ladakh region
-- is going on at a rapid pace and over 40 per cent of the drilling has been completed, the
construction company
said on Sunday. The company said it is hopeful of completing the project by December 2026.
The tunnel project - through the mighty Zojila Pass at an altitude of 11,578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National highway - is of strategic importance as the highway remains closed during winters due to heavy snowfall, cutting off Ladakh region from Kashmir.
The single-tube Zojila tunnel - from Baltal, in the Ganderbal district of central Kashmir, to Minimarg, in Drass town of Kargil district of Ladakh, is 13 km long with an approach road of 18 km.
""This project is a huge game changer by the government of India. The total length of the project from Sonamarg to Minimarg is 31 km. From Sonamarg to Baltal, it is 18 km, and then the main tunnel from Baltal to Minimarg which is 13 km long. The work is going on at a rapid pace on both the projects,"" Project Head, Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited Harpal Singh told.
MEIL is constructing the tunnel.
Live Events
Singh said the work had to be stopped for two months in the winter because of back-to-back avalanches in January in which two persons were killed.
About 38 pieces of equipment of the construction company were buried under the snow which have not yet been retrieved.
""It was a temporary setback,"" Singh said, adding, ""I am hopeful that the whole project will be completed by December 2026"".
Singh said out of the 13 km long tunnel, a total of 6 km cutting has been done - three km from this side and the rest from the other end. ""The remaining work will be completed in time,"" he said.
The project head said the company is using a modern method of tunnelling which is known as new Austrian tunnelling method.
""By this method, we have achieved three important things -- the safety of the tunnel, the safety of the work-force, and the speed,"" he added.
By using this method, he said, the chances of accidents are very low and the quality and the speed of tunnelling are very good. This is a special technology applied in Europe and North America, he said.
Out of the total 31 km project from Z-Morh tunnel in Sonamarg, to Baltal, the approach road is 18 km and the work is also going on their simultaneously.
""About 60 per cent of work has been completed on this. There are four bridges on which about 80 per cent of the work has been completed. There is five-km Nilgarh tunnels which have been completed. The work is going on at an advance pace and the approach road would be operational within two years,"" Singh said. He said people will not face any difficulty in coming to Baltal even in winter when there is heavy snowfall because of the approach road to the tunnel.
Asked about the importance of the tunnel with respect to the Defence forces, Singh said after the completion of the tunnel, the forces will be able to move across round the clock.
""The road remains closed for four months due to snowfall. It is a very long time. There are so many defence forces personnel, we have a border with China which has a strong military. It is risky for our forces to face such a huge army when there is no land connection with the rest of India.
""After this tunnel is constructed, the Indian defence forces will move uninterrupted throughout the year. People of J-K and Ladakh can move throughout the year. It will be a huge advantage. What we had not been able to do in the last 75 years, you will have it in the next three to four years,"" he said.
He said not only will it shorten the distance, the time taken will also be very less. This distance will be covered in less than 40 minutes instead of four hours, he said.
Site-incharge of MEIL, Sanjay Sharma, said the tunnel would be the longest in Asia at the highest altitude. He said there were many challenges working in the young Himalayan range.
""But, the main challenge is outside the tunnel. It is the weather. First two years, we worked in winter months also. But, last year, we had to stop for two months due to avalanches,"" he said.
Parliamentary consultative committee on Road Transport & Highways, led by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, is visiting the project site on Monday.

Network Planning Group
(
NPG

New PPP model on cards to woo infra sector investors,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/new-ppp-model-on-cards-to-woo-infra-investors/articleshow/99194006.cms,03-04-2023,"The finance ministry plans to bring out a new public-private partnership (
PPP
) architecture and a standard model concession agreement (MCA) framework for various sectors in FY24 to burnish the allure of capital-intensive infrastructure projects, seeking to draw funds by stressing their 'viability and bankability.'
The focus will be to turn the fortunes of sectors such as urban infrastructure, railways and roads, where private participation remains either minimal or far from reaching the true potential, a senior official told ET.
Similarly, the planned MCA framework would serve as a standard reference document for various infrastructure departments and state-run entities. It will offer enough flexibility to them to suitably build in clauses peculiar to their sectors.
""Private capital and bank credit will automatically flow in when an infrastructure project is considered viable and bankable,"" said the official, who declined to be named. ""So, much emphasis is being laid on structuring infrastructure projects in such a manner that they will stand on their own and generate money.""

According to a November 2022
World Bank
report, India will have to invest $840 billion over the next 15 years-or an average of $55 billion per year-into urban infrastructure alone if it is to effectively meet the needs of its fast-growing urban population.
The department of economic affairs is coordinating with relevant central government ministries and departments in firming up the frameworks.
The PPP framework is unlikely to have an incentive-driven architecture but there could be some upfront government support in the initial stage of projects in select sectors to make them viable.
Metro Template
For instance, in Metro projects, various models - including those adopted by the authorities in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune, - are being studied. To woo investors, Metro projects in some of these cities are clubbed with a certain amount of developed real estate, which, too, generates steady cash flow, said the official.
The Bangalore Metro Rail Corp. offers a set of privileges to investors, including naming and advertisement rights and space for commercial activities, for about ₹100 crore.
Similarly, in some sectors user charges could be levied to make the projects attractive to private investors. Sectors such as telecom, port and airports have succeeded in drawing private investors, thanks to the user-charge model, he said.
The move to bring in a fresh approach for infrastructure development and financing came in the aftermath of the pandemic when the Central government sharply raised its own capex outlay to spur employment and stimulate economic growth, betting on its high-multiplier effect. A government task force on the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) had in April 2020 envisaged capital investments of ₹111 lakh crore until FY25.
