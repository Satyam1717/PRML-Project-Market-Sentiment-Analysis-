AI won’t lead to a Terminator-style showdown: Innover’s Shishir Saxena,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/ai-wont-lead-to-a-terminator-style-showdown-innovers-shishir-saxena/articleshow/116489703.cms,20-12-2024,"We are in the midst of an
AI
frenzy, but
Shishir Saxena
, India Head and Executive Vice President, Innover, says many still view AI as a magical solution, leading to unrealistic expectations. Innover is an Atlanta-based technology and process digitisation company that aims to help companies transform service & supply value-chains for its customers.
In a world, where customers are still grasping the capabilities of AI, Saxena says by employing technology intelligently and adopting a 'human in the loop' approach, companies can significantly reduce the time needed for modernisation initiatives. In a chat with ET Digital, Saxena talks about how firms can leverage AI, the nature of jobs, the work Innover is doing in the country and the changes in the technology landscape. Edited excerpts.
Economic Times (ET):
What is the status of Innover's operations and growth strategy in India?
Shishir Saxena (SS):
This year is positioned as a year of strategic investment for us, focused on building the capabilities and infrastructure that will enable significant growth and scalability in the coming year.
That means we are actively engaging in collaborative working sessions with our customers to really whiteboard their goals, understand the technologies they are looking to invest in, and help shape their strategic direction. Particularly for customers with a significant presence in India, we are noticing a shift where more decision-making authority is being centralized in India. To align with this, we are heavily investing in leadership talent across key roles in India, ensuring we have the right people in place to map directly to client leadership here. This enables us to stay closely aligned with their evolving needs and offer localised expertise.
Live Events
When we first started, much of the decision-making for our clients was centred in the US, given that many of them were headquartered there. However, we are now seeing a significant shift, with more authority moving to India, particularly with the rise of captive centres and the increasing importance of India in global operations. This shift presents a key moment for us to reassess what we have done this year and evaluate the progress we have made since the beginning of the year.
We have exceeded our targets and are on track to continue growing in the high 40s in terms of year-over-year CAGR.
Shishir Saxena, India Head and Executive Vice President, Innover says that if customers truly grasp the capabilities of AI, they can make better-informed decisions.
ET: You have been in India for over five years now. Who are your typical clients and who are your competitors?
SS:
Interestingly, we compete with major players that have large customers who are clear about what they want to leverage. In the past, clients often issued large-scale RFPs and relied on intermediaries to select partners for multi-year, multi-faceted engagements. However, today’s clients are much more discerning. They understand that giving everything to a single provider does not yield the best value. Instead, they prefer to be specific about what each partner can deliver.
For example, we work with Fortune 50 and 100 companies in targeted areas where we have a strong presence, focusing primarily on data insights,
automation
, and engineering. Additionally, we have a significant segment dedicated to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). These companies are often well-funded with a clear vision, yet they may not have the resources to invest heavily in technology. As a result, they rely on us as their de facto CTO organisation, helping them build greenfield infrastructure from the ground up and scaling that infrastructure as they grow.
Both segments are crucial to our strategy. We prioritise working with customers who share our vision for investment in the areas we are passionate about. While we can assist clients who prefer to operate their systems in a maintenance mode, we prefer to collaborate with those who have a transformative vision and a plan to adopt new technologies for the future.
Our competitors vary significantly depending on the type of opportunity. In some cases, we find ourselves competing with large systems integrators (SIs) focused on large-scale efficiencies, while in others, we face niche data and analytics companies. The problem statement defines our competitive landscape, and it shifts based on the specific challenges we address.
For instance, we recently competed against some of the top three SIs when they were setting up an intelligent service desk operation. They aimed to leverage AI agents to enhance efficiency rather than relying solely on human resources. They recognized the value we could bring by using newer technologies, as traditional SIs often approach these challenges by simply increasing manpower.
ET: So, when you are talking about AI and ML, what are your clients talking about now? What is it that they want? Are they seeing value because we see a lot of talk from the tech side on how AI is going to revolutionise everything, but what’s actually the narrative from the client side?
SS:
We experienced a blockchain frenzy a few years ago, where everyone was investing heavily in the technology. Then, with the rise of AI, particularly after the release of ChatGPT, there was a lot of excitement about how it would transform the world. As a result, we now encounter two distinct types of customers, along with a spectrum of those in between.
First, there are organisations that are convinced a disruption is imminent and don’t want to be left behind. They seek a partner like us to help them understand how their world will change once AI becomes mainstream. They know it’s coming, having heard it from influencers and media experts, but they are uncertain about what it specifically means for them. We aim to simplify their ecosystem by guiding them through a series of experiments. For instance, we might show them how an agent solution can transform their finance control functions or enhance their fraud detection processes and then they understand the possibilities.
There are smarter, more evolved engineering organizations who have done the experimentation enough. They understand the potential of AI, but need a partner to scale those insights to an enterprise level. Their challenge differs; they have assembled teams that can articulate the 'art of the possible,' but they require a clear ROI to justify broader implementation. These clients recognize that while a solution may work on a small scale with a few variables, they need to consider how to truly transform their value chain by embedding these technologies. In such cases, the process becomes about institutionalizing AI in their operations, rather than treating it as an added feature. This transformation represents a significant change management exercise, as it requires integrating new practices into the daily workflows of their teams.

By employing AI intelligently and adopting a 'human in the loop' approach, we can significantly reduce the time needed for modernisation initiatives, says Saxena.
For example, in today's e-commerce-driven landscape, every company needs a strong digital presence alongside their retail operations. Consider something as straightforward as product label generation for a new coffee blend. Each country has its own regulations about what information must be included on the label, such as the source of the beans, the roast level, and the coarseness of the grind. In some cases, you also need to address sustainability practices and labor standards.
Imagine the effort involved in generating labels for every product launch manually. Now, picture a generative AI model trained to understand these varied regulations. With just one entry of label information, this AI can automatically create all the necessary versions—one for Poland, one for France, one for India, and so on.
If customers truly grasp the capabilities of AI, they can make better-informed decisions. However, many still view AI as a magical solution, leading to unrealistic expectations. We’ve observed clients who committed to their leadership teams about the transformative power of AI without having a clear vision of how it will actually change their operations.
There are two types of customers in this scenario: the first recognizes that disruption is imminent and seeks our guidance to navigate their future. We assist them in exploring what’s possible. The second group has conducted proof-of-concept (POC) experiments and is now focused on institutionalizing AI within their organizations, which is where they are directing their investments.
ET: So, what are the functional areas where you are seeing the maximum application of AI?
SS:
It's a function of the business domains where you're looking at it. For instance, certain industry segments, like banking and financial services, have always been data-rich, built on robust data ecosystems. In contrast, sectors such as traditional retail or construction have historically utilized technology and IT primarily for basic functions like invoicing and material information exchange.
Take anti-money laundering (AML) as an example within the financial sector. Every year, global agencies release updated standards and new methods that criminals use to circumvent regulations. These agencies inform institutions about the evolving landscape of financial crime, urging them to adapt their AML systems accordingly. Given the rapid pace at which these criminal tactics evolve, organizations cannot keep up without infusing AI into their operations. They possess extensive historical data sets that can inform and enhance their strategies.
In data-rich industries, where the infrastructure for implementing AI already exists, the integration can be swift and effective. Companies that have traditionally engaged in pattern detection through standard analytics can now leverage AI to supercharge their capabilities, making their fraud detection efforts much more impactful. This positions them to respond rapidly to emerging threats and continuously refine their strategies in an ever-evolving landscape.
On the developer side, creating a new app for a specific domain often involves navigating a complex landscape of consensus-building among various business users. Each stakeholder has their own perspective on how the app should look and function, making the process of defining requirements, determining features, and ensuring security quite chaotic.
However, if you have a skilled developer and a competent product manager, they can leverage AI capabilities throughout the entire product lifecycle, starting with requirements gathering. Instead of saying, 'I need an app for you,'. You will first say, tell me what the world is doing. By utilizing resources like the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times, a generative AI application can provide insights into the competitive landscape, allowing teams to avoid starting from scratch. This is arguably one of the most underutilized aspects of AI; it enables teams to engage in discussions based on AI-generated frameworks rather than entering into blank-slate conversations.
We frequently collaborate with customers who face the challenge of modernizing systems built decades ago. Often, they encounter difficulties because they lack documentation or understanding of the original code, especially when key team members are retiring. In these scenarios, AI can play a critical role by analyzing existing codebases, uncovering business logic, organizing components, and suggesting modernization pathways. This can all be achieved within a well-configured developer ecosystem.
Furthermore, the concept of 'human in the loop' is gaining acceptance. This approach allows developers to benefit from AI assistance while retaining the ability to make informed decisions, ensuring that the modernization process aligns with both technical needs and business objectives.
So, when we say AI, somehow, we start thinking about the Terminator kind of stuff, where there is no human involved ever, versus maybe having a little bit of a layer that keeps the thing sane. So instead of having an army of people figure out what the code was, you probably just need a couple of skilled individuals to effectively evaluate recommendations from an AI crawler. They can assess the output and determine, for instance, which functions to keep and which to ignore, especially if some are redundant.
By employing AI intelligently and adopting a 'human in the loop' approach, we can significantly reduce the time needed for modernization initiatives. This efficiency extends to every phase of the development lifecycle, including mockups, testing, and test data generation. When teams are equipped with the right tools and knowledge, they can streamline processes effectively. As I mentioned earlier, we are fully embracing this AI potential. All the work we undertake for our clients, regardless of the engagement type, places a responsibility on us to create a development pathway that maximizes the use of AI. It's essential for us to leverage AI while ensuring we uphold non-negotiable standards around security and other critical factors.
ET: How do you ensure that AI does not hallucinate sometimes?
SS:
That's why it's crucial to implement a testing phase where we evaluate the AI outputs thoroughly and establish guardrails. Hallucination is one of the primary challenges you face when deploying AI without the appropriate safeguards and the ability to reject outputs based on established criteria.
When we launch a new AI initiative, we take an approach similar to pair programming. We assign a senior team member to continuously monitor and assess the AI's outputs to ensure they are on the right track. Additionally, we utilize adversarial models where competing methods evaluate and automatically reject less effective outputs, ensuring that only the best solutions emerge.
This process is a collaborative effort. While we leverage AI to help mitigate hallucinations, we remain vigilant about maintaining human oversight. It’s essential to recognize that this is not a hands-off approach; we cannot simply hand over control to AI and expect it to navigate autonomously.
ET: Do you believe this will be the approach moving forward, where human involvement is needed and not completely autonomous?
SS:
Let’s break down scenarios where human involvement might not be necessary. In the experimental phase, such as when providing clients with mockup options, human oversight may not be required. During the ideation stage, I can afford to be less specific. However, when developing critical systems like fraud detection or financial applications, human input becomes essential because the risks associated with errors can be significant.

Saxena explains that while it’s true that certain jobs may diminish due to automation, it doesn't necessarily mean there will be fewer jobs overall. Instead, we should view automation as another tool in our toolbox.
We need to move beyond binary thinking and assess the specific context in which we are using AI. The level of human intervention should depend on the potential consequences of any errors. Our approach is to ensure that nothing is entirely entrusted to AI at any stage. Given the relatively short history of AI technology, we’re not ready to hand over complete control. Interestingly, this mindset fosters a culture within our company where we proactively identify tasks that can be automated. If a task is being performed manually, we challenge ourselves to find ways to automate it.
The stakes change dramatically in high-risk scenarios. Take a cheque-matching system in B2B transactions where AI might auto-reject cheques based on certain criteria. In such cases, the AI’s suggestions would still need to be reviewed by a controller who can assess the probable reasons for the rejection and ensure accuracy. Similarly, in medical diagnostics, while AI can analyze historical data to suggest probabilities of diseases, the consequences of misdiagnosis are far too significant to leave entirely to AI. Thus, human oversight remains crucial in these areas, ensuring that we mitigate risks effectively.
ET: There’s another aspect where AI is expected to take over repetitive and mundane tasks. However, the question is about the subjective nature of these tasks—what may be considered drudgery for one person could be an opportunity for creativity for another. What are your thoughts on this perspective?
SS:
It's a very interesting discussion. Recently, I read about the strikes along the entire East Coast of the US, where workers were demanding a slowdown in the pace of automation. It raises an important question: should cars have not been invented because bullock carts were giving somebody employment? This debate is ongoing. We need to ask ourselves whether those jobs are truly necessary or if we are doing enough to transition, individuals engaged in what might be considered ‘drudgery’ into more meaningful roles.
While it’s true that certain jobs may diminish due to automation, it doesn't necessarily mean there will be fewer jobs overall. Instead, we should view automation as another tool in our toolbox. As industry leaders, our responsibility is to ensure that everyone we hire understands these tools and how to leverage them effectively.
In short, while the nature of work will undoubtedly change, I don't foresee a significant reduction in overall job numbers. Instead, there will be a transformation in how we perform our jobs, leading to new roles and opportunities that we may not yet envision."
Time to be cautious: Unveiling dark patterns and impact on customers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/time-to-be-cautious-unveiling-dark-patterns-and-impact-on-customers/articleshow/116065640.cms,07-12-2024,"Technology is evolving faster than ever and so is the way in which consumers are doing shopping. Consumer preferences have been changing - health, safety, speed and convenience have become a priority for them. Consumers who had never done
online shopping
, have started to do the same and consumers who used to do online shopping, have increased the same. In addition to convenience and ease of use, online methods have also proven to be more efficient and sustainable for both consumers and organisations.
A key area of interest is the way online platforms are designed and the
manipulative practices
used on them. These manipulative practices or unethical strategies are designed to lead to exploiting cognitive and behavioral biases of consumers. Various types of unfair or abusive practices are used by certain deceptive organizations to trick or manipulate consumers to generate additional profits or other benefits are called ‘
dark patterns
’.
Many dark patterns emerge because some organisations want to see quick results like a certain number of newsletter signups or items in a shopping basket. A classic example of dark pattern is unsubscribing from a mailing list. Often, the button to unsubscribe is buried under multiple confirmation windows, or worse, hidden in tiny text at the bottom of an email. This is designed intentionally to make the process difficult, hoping users will give up halfway. Some other examples of dark patterns include:
Disguised advertisements:
Advertisements that look like independent content.
Forced continuity:
Making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.
Hidden costs:
Adding unexpected charges at the last step of a transaction.
Live Events
While dark patterns can lead to short-term gains in conversions or data collection, they risk alienating customers in the long run. In a digital landscape where trust is critical, these tactics can cause severe reputational and financial damage. There is also a potential for legal repercussions. In recent years, regulatory bodies have started cracking down on dark patterns. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, includes provisions to penalize websites that use confusing or deceptive methods to obtain user consent for data collection.
Given the onset of the festive season, where there is an uptake in shopping activity, there is a high possibility of increase in the number of online users as more consumers would turn to online platforms for their purchases. This increase is also a result of major ecommerce marketplaces launching annual sales during this time to offer significant discounts and a wide range of products to attract shoppers. This is a time for consumers to stay vigilant in order to avoid dark patterns. Below are some measures that can be taken to prevent becoming a victim:
Stay informed:
Educate yourself about common dark patterns, such as disguised ads, hidden costs, and forced continuity.
Read carefully:
Always read the terms and conditions, privacy policies, and any prompts before making decisions.
Use browser extensions: Consider using tools that can detect and warn you about dark patterns.
Be skeptical of urgency:
Watch for tactics that create a false sense of urgency, like countdown timers or limited-time offers.
Check for clear options:
Look for straightforward choices, such as clear opt-in and opt-out options for subscriptions.
Take your time:
Don’t rush through decisions, especially when signing up for services or making purchases.
Research:
Look up reviews or discussions about a website or app to see if others have encountered dark patterns.
Tackling dark patterns involves the collective efforts of the government, consumers and organisations. While consumers need to be aware of unfair practices that fall under the terminology of dark patterns, their rights, and grievance redressal options, organisations need to understand that instead of manipulating customers, they should trust that consumers will make appropriate selections when they are given genuine choice. Safeguarding customers with responsible practices will pave the way for building trust, that will, in the long run, contribute to the well-being and success of the society, consumers and also the organisations.

Tech for real-world applications: How enterprises can build AI systems tailored to their needs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/tech-for-real-world-applications-how-enterprises-can-build-ai-systems-tailored-to-their-needs/articleshow/115722985.cms,27-11-2024,"As artificial intelligence (
AI
) becomes a critical tool for businesses, organizations are grappling with how to best customize
large language models
(LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT and Anthropic's Claude to meet specific needs. A recent survey by Insight Partners found that nearly half of enterprises are adopting methods to incorporate industry-specific knowledge into these models.
Traditionally, fine-tuning has been used to adapt AI models for tasks like image recognition or specialized business applications. However, newer techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and in-context learning are gaining traction, offering distinct advantages for real-time and flexible AI performance.
RAG and in-context learning: What’s the difference?
RAG, a method introduced by Meta AI researcher Patrick Lewis in 2020, allows LLMs to retrieve external data during use, making it particularly useful for businesses that require up-to-date information. For example, legal compliance and customer service tasks often demand precise and current data, making RAG an attractive option.
In contrast, in-context learning provides examples or context directly within the task prompt, guiding the AI’s responses without requiring external data retrieval. This approach relies on the pre-trained knowledge already within the model, making it simpler but less dynamic than RAG.
Live Events
The role of larger context windows
Recent advancements in AI technology have expanded the capabilities of LLMs to handle much larger amounts of text at once. Leading models like Anthropic’s Claude for enterprise can now process up to 500,000 tokens, while Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gradient's AI startup have reached the million-token milestone. Efforts by companies like Google Cloud and Magic aim to push this limit to 100 million tokens, equivalent to about ten years of human speech.
These breakthroughs raise questions about whether RAG will remain necessary. If LLMs can process vast amounts of information within their context windows, the need for external data retrieval might diminish.
Challenges with larger context windows
However, there are significant challenges to this approach. Research by Li et al. (2024) shows that models often struggle with lengthy, complex inputs. Information buried deep in a long sequence may be overlooked, even in models optimized for large context windows.
Cost is another factor. Token-based pricing models mean that processing extensive text inputs can quickly become expensive for businesses. By keeping input lengths shorter, RAG offers a more cost-effective alternative.
A hybrid future?
While some experts predict that RAG could become less relevant as LLMs improve, new methods are blending the strengths of both approaches. Techniques like LongRAG, introduced by Jiang et al. (2024), group documents into larger units combining the efficiency of RAG with the expanded capabilities of long-context models. Additionally, innovations like Infini-Attention are making in-context learning more efficient by prioritizing the most critical information.
Choosing the right approach
Industry experts emphasize that RAG and long-context models have unique strengths:
- Long-context models excel in tasks like multi-document summarization and long-term planning, where understanding extensive text is crucial.
- RAG is better suited for real-time applications requiring precise and dynamic data retrieval, such as customer service and regulatory compliance.
For many businesses, a hybrid solution may be the best option, leveraging RAG for efficiency and long-context models for depth.
The path forward for enterprises
Despite advances in long-context processing, RAG remains a practical and cost-effective option for many enterprises. A recent report by Harvard Business Review named RAG the leading method for building AI systems tailored to enterprise needs.
As AI technologies continue to evolve, businesses must carefully evaluate their specific requirements and choose the methods—or combinations—that align with their goals. For now, both RAG and in-context learning remain vital tools in the race to customize AI for real-world applications.

Gen AI and cybersecurity are top investment priorities for executives: PwC report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/gen-ai-and-cybersecurity-are-top-investment-priorities-for-executives-pwc-report/articleshow/115686883.cms,26-11-2024,"Indian executives rank
cybersecurity
as their top
risk mitigation
priority (61% of the respondents), followed by digital and technology risks (60%), inflation (48%) and environmental risks (30%) for the next 12 months, according to
PwC
’s 2025 Digital Trust Insights – India Highlights.
The report revealed that 93% of respondents anticipate an increase in their cybersecurity budgets next year, with 17% planning to raise their budgets by 15% or more — an increase of 1% from last year. It also speaks about the need for MSMEs to focus on cybersecurity as a vital component of their planning and operations.
Sivarama Krishnan, Partner and Leader, Partner & Leader, Risk Consulting, PwC India & Leader of APAC Cyber Security & Privacy, PwC, says over the past few years, cybersecurity has become a strategic imperative for organisations of all sizes. “The digital age presents numerous opportunities, and the risks associated with it do not discriminate based on the size of businesses. Medium and small enterprises must see cybersecurity as a fundamental aspect to their survival and success,” he says.
According to the report,
cloud-related threats
remain the foremost worry as 55% of Indian executives call it their most worrying cyber risk, marking a 3% increase from the previous year. However, 50% of security leaders and chief financial officers (CFOs) feel least prepared to address these threats in the coming year.
Elaborating further on advanced technological defences, the report highlights that
Gen AI
is at the helm of cyber investment priorities, with 87% of organisations boosting their investments over the past 12 months. “Additionally, 86% of organisations have increased their spending on AI governance as part of their risk management strategies. Furthermore, 80% of Indian companies are highly confident in their ability to comply with AI regulations,” it says.

The report also says that despite all efforts, the impact of cyber incidents remains substantial. The percentage of security leaders in India reporting a data breach with costs exceeding $20 million has decreased by 3% from last year to 8%. Additionally, 44% of leaders have experienced a data breach costing over $500,000 in the past three years. More than 33% of leaders indicate that most of their serious data breaches within the last three years have incurred costs of no less than $1 million.
Krishnan points out that only one-fifth of organisations are adopting thorough risk quantification methodologies. “This disparity highlights an overlooked opportunity that must now be addressed. Developing a dependable cyber risk quantification system is crucial for informed decision-making and prioritising strategic investments,” he adds."
AI Agents: The next frontier in CRM and business automation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/ai-agents-the-next-frontier-in-crm-and-business-automation/articleshow/114532834.cms,24-10-2024,"Artificial intelligence
(AI) has evolved rapidly, shifting from basic rule-based systems to intelligent, autonomous agents capable of executing complex tasks. In this new era,
AI Agents
are transforming customer relationship management (
CRM
) and
business automation
. These intelligent systems not only handle routine tasks but also act as collaborative partners, streamlining operations and providing personalised customer experiences.
The evolution of AI: From automation tools to intelligent agents
AI’s first wave centred on rule-based automation tools designed to perform repetitive tasks with precision. This first wave of AI brought efficiency but was limited in adaptability. The second wave, powered by machine learning, allowed AI to process vast amounts of data, generating valuable insights that supported decision-making across industries. Today, we are in the midst of AI’s third wave — AI Agents. These intelligent systems go beyond providing insights; they autonomously perform tasks and make decisions, applying their intelligence to various business operations.
AI Agents are changing the way businesses manage their processes, especially in CRM. They can independently handle tasks such as lead generation, data entry, follow-ups, and customer service queries. This shift from mere automation to intelligent task execution has opened new possibilities for businesses, allowing them to be more responsive, efficient, and customer-centric.
Revolutionising CRM: Enhancing customer relationships and sale
AI Agents have the potential to dramatically enhance customer relationship management. Traditionally, CRM systems require manual inputs for tasks like responding to customer inquiries, updating data, and generating leads. AI Agents now automate these processes, reducing response times and improving accuracy. Their knowledge automation capabilities also ensure that critical information is available, enhancing customer engagement and driving revenue. More importantly, AI Agents offer personalised customer experiences by interacting with clients in real time, learning from each interaction to refine their responses.
Live Events
By integrating across multiple communication channels, such as email, chat, and social media, AI Agents ensure consistent and unified customer interactions. This helps businesses to maintain a cohesive brand experience, regardless of how customers engage. Moreover, AI Agents retrieve and analyse customer data, providing actionable insights to sales teams, enabling them to optimise the sales process and focus on high-value tasks, such as nurturing relationships and closing deals.
Business process automation: Driving operational efficiency
Beyond CRM, AI Agents are transforming broader business operations through automation. They handle a wide range of tasks, from processing invoices to managing unstructured data and automating
IT helpdesk
services. By integrating with enterprise systems, AI Agents automate workflows, identify patterns, and provide data-driven insights that enhance decision-making.
For instance, in financial operations, Finance AI Agent streamline tasks like invoice processing and expense tracking, improving accuracy and reducing manual labor. IT Support AI Agent autonomously manage service requests and troubleshoot common issues. By automating these repetitive and time-consuming processes, AI Agents free up employees to focus on more complex, strategic tasks, leading to improved operational efficiency and cost savings across the organisation.
Data-driven insights and real-time decision making

Western Digital to now ship 32TB UltraSMR HDDs to meet growing nearline demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/western-digital-to-now-ship-32tb-ultrasmr-hdds-to-meet-growing-nearline-demand/articleshow/114447927.cms,22-10-2024,"Western Digital
, on Tuesday, announced that it is now shipping UltraSMR HDD with up to 32TB leveraging PMR (ePMR) recording technology for hyperscalers, CSPs and enterprises.
For those who want a drop-in ready HDD for today’s data-intensive workloads, the company is also shipping ePMR CMR HDD with up to 26TB for enterprise and channel customers.
The AI Data Cycle has emerged as a growth driver for the storage industry. As AI systems become more sophisticated, they process and generate vast amounts of data that must be stored efficiently. HDDs play a crucial role in this ecosystem, handling both the input side, where data is gathered, ingested and stored, and the output side, where AI content is generated and preserved. This dual role positions HDDs as a linchpin in the AI Data Cycle, ensuring that data is available when needed and stored with the lowest TCO.
John Chen
, Vice President at TRENDFOCUS, said in a statement, “With the rise of AI, edge computing, and large-scale
data centres
, HDDs play a critical role in delivering huge capacity, performance and low power, making them indispensable for enterprises that want the highest storage density with the lowest TCO. With the addition of the new 11-disk platform, Western Digital is well-positioned to continue to drive key HDD use cases – optimising virtually all users in all markets for success in today’s data-intensive landscape.”
Western Digital’s newest 26TB CMR and 32TB UltraSMR drives utilise multiple technological innovations to enable data centres to maximise their storage efficiency. In addition to ePMR, OptiNAND™, ArmorCache™ and a triple-stage actuator (TSA), the drives feature the world’s first commercially available 11-disk platform along with other design enhancements.

“These new drives are designed with the highest ePMR capacities, low power and high reliability, which helps lower TCO and overall energy demand of data centre operations. HDDs are also the most cost-effective and most efficient solution to store data accessible at scale. By improving TCO, HDDs can help contribute to reducing carbon footprints, a key component of India's environmental goals,” said
Ravi Pendekanti
, SVP of Product Management, HDD Business Unit, Western Digital.
These new HDDs have up to 257 MiB/s sequential performance and use as little as 5.5W power idle, making them ideal for warm and cold tiers of data.
He added that as data centres scale to accommodate growing data demands, HDDs allow operators to handle larger volumes of data with fewer resources, helping reduce operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions.
“For example, upgrading 24TB CMR HDDs to the new 32TB SMR HDDs to deploy 192PB of storage would require 23% fewer servers and would use 20% lower energy consumption in Watts/TB idle to store the same amount of data. There is also less infrastructure and maintenance cost by eliminating the extra servers. So overall, TCO savings is achieved by using higher capacity 32TB and eliminating servers and all other supporting infrastructure,” he said.
Combined with renewable energy initiatives and other eco-friendly practices, HDDs help enable more sustainable, scalable, and eco-conscious data centre operations that align with a company’s broader sustainability targets."

Shard Center for Innovation
aims to create a knowledge-driven society through education in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, drone operations, machine learning, robotics, virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (
IoT
). In an interaction with ET Online, Pankaj Kumar Singh, the Managing Director of the centre, discusses the importance of aligning education with emerging tech trends like AI and robotics to equip students with the skills needed for the global job market. Edited excerpts:
ET: What was the inspiration behind the Shard Center for Innovation? What gap in the market were you aiming to fill?
Pankaj Kumar Singh:
The inception of the Shard Center for Innovation was driven by a profound understanding of the evolving demands of technology and a vision to revolutionise education in this field. Observing the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning and other emerging technologies, it became increasingly apparent that traditional educational frameworks are not adequate to equip students for the future. We identified a significant gap in the market for an education model that seamlessly integrates theoretical knowledge with hands-on, practical experience. By encouraging critical thinking, technical acumen and entrepreneurial spirit, the centre is dedicated to cultivating the next generation of innovators and leaders who are fully prepared to navigate and excel in a rapidly advancing technological landscape.
ET: Do you believe Indian students are adequately prepared for this type of learning?
PKS:
I believe that while Indian students have great potential, many are not fully prepared for the rapidly changing technological landscape, especially in fields like robotics. According to the India Skills Report 2023, only about 50% of Indian graduates are employable due to a gap in practical skills and exposure to emerging technologies. This highlights a critical need for education systems to focus more on hands-on, experiential learning rather than just theoretical knowledge.
ET: If robotic learning is so important, should it start from school?
PKS:
Robotic learning is particularly important for schoolchildren because it boosts essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking and collaboration from a young age. According to a study by the
World Economic Forum
, 65% of children entering primary school today will eventually work in jobs that do not yet exist. Robotic education equips students with the ability to adapt to new challenges, think creatively, and understand complex systems, which are crucial skills for the future job market.
Pankaj Kumar Singh, Managing Director, Shard centre of innovation
Live Events
ET: How does the centre ensure that the skills taught in its programmes are aligned with the evolving demands of the industry, particularly in AI, robotics and IoT?
PKS:
Firstly, we engage in continuous dialogue with industry leaders and experts to understand the latest trends and skill requirements. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, emerging technologies such as AI, robotics and IoT are expected to create over 97 million new jobs by 2025, with a strong emphasis on specialised skills and practical expertise. To meet these demands, we regularly update our curriculum to incorporate the latest technological advancements.
Our courses are designed in collaboration with industry partners, ensuring that the skills we teach are directly applicable in the real world. For instance, in AI, we focus on machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and ethical AI practices, which are among the most sought-after skills today, according to LinkedIn’s 2023 Emerging Jobs Report.

ET: Given the current trend where many education platforms are investing heavily in online presence, why do you focus more on physical centres?
PKS
: While online education platforms have certainly gained popularity, we believe that physical centres offer unparalleled advantages, especially in the realm of hands-on, technology-driven learning. Emerging fields such as AI, robotics and IoT require more than just theoretical understanding; they demand practical, tactile experience with equipment and real-world problem-solving exercises.
Physical centres provide an environment where students can engage directly with advanced tools and technologies under the guidance of expert mentors. This face-to-face interaction facilitates deeper understanding, immediate feedback and collaboration, which are critical for mastering complex skills. According to a Harvard Business Review study, students retain up to 75% more information when they are actively engaged in hands-on learning compared to traditional or online methods.
Moreover, our focus on physical centres aligns with our commitment to fostering innovation and creativity. In-person interactions foster a collaborative spirit and teamwork, skills that are essential in the tech industry. Our centres are equipped with state-of-the-art labs, innovation spaces and resources that are not easily replicated in a virtual environment.
ET: At a time when continuous learning is crucial, how does the organisation support working professionals in staying competitive and updated with industry trends?
PKS:
We recognise the critical need for continuous learning, especially for working professionals looking to stay ahead in a fast-paced technological landscape. To support them, we offer a variety of programmes designed to enhance their skills in line with current industry demands. Our offerings include flexible evening and weekend courses, online learning modules, and immersive workshops that cover cutting-edge technologies such as AI, robotics, IoT and data science.
According to a LinkedIn report, 87% of learning and development professionals agree that closing skills gaps in their organisation is critical to future success. Additionally, a survey by Deloitte found that companies that prioritise continuous learning are 46% more likely to be the first to market and 92% more likely to innovate. To align with these findings, our curriculum is developed in collaboration with industry leaders and updated regularly to reflect the latest trends and technologies.
We also integrate real-world projects, case studies, and mentorship opportunities into our programmes, allowing professionals to apply what they learn directly to their roles. This practical approach ensures that participants are not only keeping pace with technological advancements, but are also prepared to drive innovation and leadership within their organisations.
ET: Can you discuss key partnerships that have been instrumental in advancing the organisation’s goals?
PKS:
The centre has strategically aligned with key industry and academic partners to stay at the forefront of technological advancements. Our collaborations with prestigious organisations such as the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (
AAAI

China hasn’t destroyed the tech sector. It’s sharpened it,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/china-hasnt-destroyed-the-tech-sector-its-sharpened-it/articleshow/113869320.cms,02-10-2024,"To most Western observers, it would appear that
China
has driven its technology industry off a cliff. The number of
startups
fell by 50,000 between the peak in 2018 and 2023, with this year on track to be even lower. The market capitalizations of the biggest tech companies, including
Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd. and
Tencent Holdings
Ltd., have shrunk to the tune of hundreds of billions, and pale in comparison to US peers.
There is no sign that the sector will ever rebound to what it was before a government crackdown that kicked off in late 2020, even as policymakers have signaled it’s over. Becoming a billionaire entrepreneur has become something to be feared, rather than celebrated.
It’s easy for US policymakers to see this with vindication and yet more evidence of a superior tech landscape at home. And from their vantage point, they are correct: President Xi Jinping strangled a generation of entrepreneurs who could have benefited consumers and made investors a lot of money.
But that doesn’t mean China’s
innovation ecosystem
is slowing. If anything, Xi has only sharpened its goal to focus on national clout and security in a way that could shift the global balance of power.
Beijing has given its tech industry something that Silicon Valley can only dream of: a mission. It may be easy for investors and free-market capitalists to scoff at the idea of innovation being driven by a purpose. But as the ongoing drama at OpenAI has laid bare — and as my colleague Parmy Olson has recently written — US tech entrepreneurs and workers alike have long been obsessed with this concept. And a vast majority of Gen Z say having a sense of purpose is an important factor for work. OpenAI started as a nonprofit research organization with the goal of creating
artificial intelligence
that “benefits all of humanity,” and ended up launching ChatGPT, spurring the global AI boom. As it evolved to a “capped-profit” and now is poised to become a for-profit company, it has seen an exodus of much of its founding team.
Live Events
Many Chinese, meanwhile, now believe the world is less secure than it was five years ago, and see tensions with Washington as one of the most pressing concerns. This existential threat of losing to the US is being used as a driving force for China’s tech ambitions.
Fresh off dismantling the get-rich-quick era, Xi has doubled down on a push for tech-driven “high quality growth” as well as “common prosperity.” The government has laid out a vision for a technological future where China leads in strategic areas such as artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, and green industries like solar and electric vehicles. This is already reaping dividends as exports of batteries, electric cars and solar panels hit records.
The US may currently have a lead in advanced technologies such as AI, but China is progressing rapidly with a laser-sharp focus to close that gap. New research suggests that the Communist Party’s top-down determination to dominate these global markets is driving innovation at a faster pace than thought, and many Chinese tech firms will likely equal or surpass Western companies within roughly a decade.
Washington seems acutely aware that Beijing’s tech prowess is posing a threat, and has reacted with a slew of export measures to prevent China from accessing cutting-edge AI chips and manufacturing equipment. But these policies have further spurred Beijing’s commitment to its tech self-sufficiency goals. A recent teardown of Huawei’s Xinchuang laptop shows that the country is making rapid progress on this front, with most of the important chips in the device coming from Chinese groups.
More recently, Beijing has been supporting this push by asking tech firms and electrical vehicle makers to buy more locally produced chips. This has provided a market for domestic semiconductor firms, and also opened sources of revenue that can be used for research and development as well as expansion.
The US innovation ecosystem, driven by entrepreneurship, has spurred decades of rapid economic growth and consumer benefits. But after startups became the biggest companies in the world, the incentive to experiment and invent something truly new became obfuscated. It’s no longer innovate or die, but create shareholder value or perish. This has encouraged the brightest minds in Silicon Valley to focus on short-term returns rather than novel breakthroughs. It has turned once-exciting product launch events into boring updates.
China’s use of national interests as an incentive for innovation isn’t as far off from an all-too-American playbook that predated the US tech revolution. Like the space race during the US-Soviet Union Cold War that paved the way for Silicon Valley, many of these developments may end up having a dual use, providing downstream benefits to consumers.
It’s too soon for US policymakers to look at the decimation of China’s internet and consumer tech sectors as signs of victory in this Cold War. Washington would be wise to foster purpose-driven research, whether at universities or independent labs, rather than leave America’s boldest ambitions to the whims of Big Tech interests."
AI in HR has more obstacles for adoption since dealing with humans: Oracle’s Nagaraj Nadendla,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/ai-in-hr-has-more-obstacles-for-adoption-since-dealing-with-humans-oracles-nagaraj-nadendla/articleshow/113847640.cms,01-10-2024,"With technology and AI permeating every aspect of business, its impact on the function that deals with humans in an organisation perhaps needs a deeper look. In a chat with ET Digital on the sidelines of the
Oracle
CloudWorld in Las Vegas,
Nagaraj Nadendla
,
SVP
,
Product Development
at Oracle, talks about the emergence of AI in the field of HR, its use cases, utility and the looming prospects of job losses. Edited excerpts:
Economic Times (ET): It has been a crazy job market of late. We have seen the highs and then we have seen the lows, with job losses. People are fearful because they do not really know what to expect. Now you are throwing AI into the mix. What does it do? How does it play out?
Nagaraj Nadendla (NN):
If you look back at history, automation has come in many flavours. For example, rules-based automation has been there for a long time. There is workflow automation, where, for example, you are making an offer to a candidate and it goes beyond a certain threshold, you then need to take additional approvals. Then, machine learning came along that included aspects like suggestions, recommendations, predictions, etc. Now, AI is pushing the envelope.
If you take the auto industry, everything was handcrafted. But, guess what? In the early 20th century, the assembly line came along. From thousands of cars to 10,000s to 100,000s to millions of cars could be produced. Robots came along in the mid-20th century, but it did not displace workers. It improved productivity. Economic activity expanded. You take the case of any industry — construction, hospitality, etc — automation has enhanced productivity overall. That does not mean you do not need to reskill. Reskilling is a fact of life. So that is why organisations are thinking about being skills driven. This is the new currency.
What skills do I have and not have? What can I develop? What should I acquire externally? What should I borrow? These are all important questions companies should consider now.
It is an important mindset to have for organisations to be agile, nimble and prepare for the future. I am not predicting there would not be any job losses, but it should not be about job losses. It is redefining jobs in many ways and that has happened historically.
Live Events
Nagaraj Nadendla, SVP, Product Development at Oracle
ET: More services now offer options to screen job applicants using artificial intelligence, but there’s a risk of bias. How can we prevent this?
NN:
It is always possible. And I directly participate in managing recruiting functions within the product division. But, if you take a step back, humans are the most biased. There is no machine that can beat humans. So, if you start from there, it only gets better. But it has to be defensible. We get that.
Customers use a variety of tools, including ours, to determine job descriptions. Are the screening processes biased? So, in many high-volume industries, there is something called IO psychology-based assessments. They will give you a questionnaire and will then determine propensity for attrition and how long a candidate would stay, for example, in a call centre or in a retail job. So, there is a body of defensible IO psychology-based assessments that are time-tested.
Today, if you take technology jobs, many candidates are getting screened for technical skills. There is no bias there. Either you have them or you do not. There might be some grey area here and there, but the tools are evaluating. Increasingly, I think, if you start thinking about skills, people will get tested for every skill, one way or the other. It is almost like a background check. At the time you make an offer, the last step is, I give you the offer, but it is all pending on the background check. Like, is there a criminal record history? This is a sort of KYC.
Ultimately, customers are the arbiter. We are not. We focus on how we enable and help them with ensuring the accuracy of generative AI or classic AI. If you match a candidate, why is there a match? Ultimately, customers make the choice. So, there is bias, but human bias is worse than any other bias, right?
If you take the entire hiring or promotion procedure, there is nothing that prevents customers from cordoning off parts of the process where no AI tool will play a part. You can have agents or AI agents or others to provide you feedback. But how you process it and what you do with it could still be a human being. Assuming they are not biased.
ET: Let me extend that question a bit. Are you also suggesting that there should be certain functions where probably AI only does a part of the work? For example, you are sifting through thousands of CVs. The AI only looks at the skill set part of it and not the other aspects of the CV like gender or ethnicity?
NN:
That is a possible way, and these capabilities already exist. As far as I know, nobody feeds in gender, ethnicity, and other bits of protected information.
It can be about what schools you went to, but even there you can have a potential for bias. If you went to IIT versus NIIT versus Harvard, there could be a difference.
However, I want to go back to the first part of the question. As the dust settles on AI capabilities, eventually I see the cost-benefit analysis might end up being wherever there is a significant amount of work that a machine can do faster — excluding maybe some elements of human evaluation — AI will get entrenched. If I was to predict, if I was a betting man, that is what I would do.
In my domain, you take India as an example — or the Middle East or even parts of APAC and J-PAC and Latin America — you will see a lot of high-volume hiring happening. So, you need to schedule candidates for interviews at scale. Now, imagine if each candidate had a digital twin, an agent, and my agent is talking to all the digital twins to coordinate, to negotiate, on an interview slot, it would be of great value.
It is those things that become a lot more amenable to AI, driving much more positive outcomes. Minimal delays, better negotiation, or faster negotiation, getting to outcomes.
ET: Let us look at the skill to operate. If you look at a person who handles the accounts in a typical
SMB
, he must have honed his skills by working on an ERP system, which may be Oracle. Now, technology companies are launching new AI tools. So, what does it do to the demands of the skill set for the accounts executive? Also, the primary question that most SMBs ask is that, is the return going to be in commensurate with the kind of effort and the cost that we have to incur?
NN:
Regardless of the size, at some point if you decide to make a change or transform, be more skills driven or at least take parts of your back office or whatever office functions and look at introducing technology, or any automation technology, there are implications to development of the talent. So, it ultimately goes back to what I am willing to do. If I bring in technology, it is going to drive certain business outcomes, but it also has workforce implications. Am I willing to upskill, reskill or expand the skill sets, or am I looking externally? I think these are all decisions organisations have to make. Again, if I was to prognosticate, maybe SMBs will look at acquiring the skills and not invest in the development of the skills within the organisation, versus larger organisations where they have significantly more investments in learning and development, reskilling and upskilling.
ET: If you look at various functions, like finance, marketing and supply chain, is HR perhaps the most difficult part when it comes to technology adoption and AI, as it is dealing with a lot of people, emotions, etc?
NN:
There are, certainly, more obstacles for adoption in HR I would say, more so than in other areas, only because you are dealing with humans, and issues like data privacy and other laws. If you think about data privacy specifically, it started with North America and then the EU. Now every country has their own data privacy laws. And it did not stop there. If you think about AI, even within the US, New York has a state law.
If you look at Europe, there are worker councils and you cannot do certain things with talent without going through the councils. So, inherently, there are breaks put in by governments and even self-governance by organisations to ensure people are appropriately accounted for. But I think, again, history has shown technology has permeated processes in many ways.

Sonny Singh (SS):
Thereare only three physical products that exist in financial services today — the debit card, credit card and a cheque book. Everything else is technology. So, there is an interesting statement that I have heard multiple times working in this industry that a bank essentially is just a technology company with a banking licence. So, if you really think about the business of banking, whether you are in the capital market space or in the corporate banking space or in retail banking, banking is essentially technology.
So, I would say that you can scarcely underestimate the importance of technology in banking. Banks are just a series of bits and bytes moving across. India is a great example of digital payments; but globally, more and more transactions are now moving to a digital format and there will be fewer and fewer physical payments.
Live Events
There will be physical payments. But if you compare pre-Covid payments to post-Covid payments, digital customers who only did digital transactions went up three times during Covid, understandably, and transactions went up six times.
So, as banks emerged from Covid, technology became even more important for them because more and more of their transactions were moving to a digital format and that is accelerating. Now, we have things like instant payments where you have very fast settlements. So, that is just talking about technology.
Now, you look at the next evolution of technology, which is AI. AI is going to be a transformational force as far as banking and financial services are concerned. There will be regulatory oversight on it because the models that are used have to be transparent and they have to be observable and scrutinised. But if anybody believes that AI is not going to be critical for the operations of financial institutions in the future, they are in for a surprise.
ET: So, on the topic of AI, the foremost area of concern is what it will do for jobs. What is your view?
SS:
This is my 35th year in technology and every wave of technology always seems to create a disruption where people think jobs are going to go away. I think a certain class of jobs will go away and a new class of jobs will come about. There is a very famous term called Luddites and when the steam engine was invented, people really thought that was the end of the world. We have survived 200 years after that; the population has grown by 3x since then and we still have a lot of jobs.
I think we do not know what we do not know. And the way jobs will evolve over the coming years, they will take advantage of all these things. So, maybe if I am used to doing something today, I may not be able to do exactly that job 5-7 years, 10 years from now, but I will be able to do something that creates value for my enterprise — whether it is in acquiring customers, whether it is introducing new products, whether it is in fulfilment operations, I will do something valuable for the enterprise. It will be powered differently. I will have different tools at my disposal. The type of value I create might be different from the type of value I create today. But I think if that is the only concern, that would not be a problem, because we will reinvent industries as we go along, as we have over the last 100 years.
ET: We have talked about the people who work in the sector, so let us park that aside. Now, let us look at borrowers and lenders. What is technology and AI going to do for borrowers and what is it going to do for lenders?
SS:
These models are evolving and they are increasing in the pace of their evolution. But let us talk about the lenders and individual consumers first. From a lender’s perspective, the idea is to really offer products that are tailored to a particular individual, that are focused on the appropriate life moments that they have. So, right now, banks have all these disparate systems, where the loan systems and the deposit systems and the wealth systems and all of that are completely siloed. They do not even have a single view of the customer and they cannot bring a unified view of the customer experience. So, the first thing that will happen is it will allow banks to more effectively participate in the financial well-being of their customers.
Sonny Singh, Executive Vice President & General Manager, Oracle Financial Services.
Second, with these advanced models, they will have much more information to make things like credit decisions. Third, as they look at the buildup of their credit books, they will have better ways to model all the different scenarios that can happen in the external world, things that could impact their liquidity.
So, if you remember spring of last year, we had several large banks go under. It almost started a banking crisis. Why did that happen? It was not because those banks were not smart. It was because their risk management did not anticipate certain types of risks that were happening. And because they did not anticipate it, they had a run on the liquidity and all of a sudden, they found themselves illiquid at the time. So, as we get better tech and better models working on this, we can work out a lot more scenarios for the lenders so that they are not susceptible.
From a borrower's perspective, I think it will create a much better experience. I live in the US, where if you are filling out a mortgage application to buy a house, it is a very long and elaborate process and it actually is a frustrating process. I have to share information two or three times that I have already provided the bank in other contexts. So, that does not create a great experience for me. Also, the rates or the products are not tailored to me. So, when you reverse that lens that I described from the lender's perspective, all of that drives advantages for the borrower. It gives me much more targeted pricing. It gives me much more targeted products. It gives me a much better experience because technology is enabling all that information to flow seamlessly and the models that are running on that information are helping the bank and borrower with a better interaction.
ET: Data security, regulation, compliance, ethics and competition. A Citi report says AI models are known to hallucinate and create information that does not exist. This can be particularly troublesome in the financial services space. How can AI take that leap forward?
SS:
Well, I mean, there are a lot of things in what you just said. Firstly, let me talk about security and then I will go to regulation. So, in my mind, one of the reasons why Oracle is so differentiated in the world of security is because we have had this notion of autonomous for a very long time.
If you look at the traditional areas where security challenges happen, there are three or four of them. The first thing is human error. Human error is, if you were supposed to do X and you did Y, you created a vulnerability. When you use autonomous technologies where models that have been trained over reams and reams of data, they are far more capable of avoiding those mistakes than humans who have to go through training to do their jobs. So, from our standpoint, AI actually facilitates through our autonomous technologies. It actually prevents security breaches.
There are other reasons for security breaches, things like passwords. Some people will have a password and call it ‘password.’ There are probably like a hundred passwords out there that if you test it out against many systems, you will be able to breach. So, we are creating a lot of visual intelligence and natural language, biometrics, and other things to prevent that security. So, again, technology actually helps in this regard, but you have to implement it properly.

The third is data motion. When data is at rest or in motion, people can tap into it on the network, there is network vulnerability. We have spent years, decades, in encryption technology. So, our data is always encrypted. And in fact, our operators in our cloud do not see the data of our customers. They cannot see it. The customers hold the keys to the data, not our operators. Our operators can do the job in the cloud, but they cannot see any of the data.
The fourth is writing bad code. So, as we move to more AI generated code, we are putting a lot of focus on making sure that the code itself is not created with many of the common mistakes that are made in coding that create vulnerabilities.
So, these are all technologies that actually support better security. And it is coming through AI. It is coming through all these investments that we made in things like encryption.
On the regulatory side, you asked that part of the question. I mean, I can tell you that if you ask a CEO what keeps him or her up at night? It is all obvious stuff, shareholder value, and growth, but one thing that they worry a lot about is the reputational damage that comes from financial crime and fraud.
Now think of people who do money laundering. They are not your typical user. They are very advanced technologists. They are not people who are novices at technology. These are state actors, these are very sophisticated cyber criminals who do money laundering, and they have very advanced tools at their disposal and banks struggle a lot to keep up with them. So, in my mind, when you think about compliance, we already have products out there in the market that are enabling detection and investigation. We are also providing AI agents that act like bad actors, so a bank can truly experience what these attacks could look like. So, in my mind, again, AI is a huge transformer in the battle against financial crime.
Yes, there has to be regulatory scrutiny and things can go wrong. I will take the example of your hallucinations that can get created. So, imagine that the AI does not use proper data and rejects a credit application. That is a problem because the bank can be fined for having unfair lending practices. So, it is not that you can just adopt any kind of AI and put it into motion. It has to be put through the paces, it has to be tested extensively. More importantly, you better be training with very large-scale data sets. So, yes, the AI will be scrutinised, data models will have to be transparent, and regulators will scrutinise this and they will continue to increase the scrutiny on this as this evolves. But in my mind, if you look at security, financial crime, regulatory risk, all of these are going to be greatly enhanced with AI.
ET: So, the financial sector is not only big banks. You have a lot of startups. You have a lot of smaller SMBs who are dealing with different types of financial products. Do you see them behaving differently from the more established or the traditional banks and do their needs also differ?
SS:
Yes, most certainly. You are familiar with JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest banks in the US, and perhaps the world. So, Jamie Dimon, in his last letter to the shareholders, mentioned that he has 57,000 IT professionals. You go to a small bank; they have 5,000 people. If you go to a credit union, they probably have 50 people.
So, obviously, how they use technology versus how JPMorgan Chase uses technology are two different things. On one end of the spectrum are the really big banks with sophistication in technology, sophisticated thinking, large IT groups. They will partner with technology partners and they will take parts from them and they will add their own technology — whatever you can call it, secret sauces — on them because they have the wherewithal to do that. And so, they look for technology partners as enablers and augmenters.
When you go to the other end of the spectrum, you have a small credit union or a small community bank. They want you to do everything. They want you to do cash management. They want you to do check printing. They want you to do ATM restocking, including an IT help desk, and everything that comes with their operations. They do not want to be in the business of technology. So, then they want partners who can provide end-to-end services. So, here the technology partner is a full-service provider.
Now, if you take a bank in the middle, like a $100 billion bank, they will do a mix of both. They will take a lot of piece parts, like they might take our ERP systems or our core banking systems, but they might build the channel technology themselves. So, that is the range that you will experience in this regard.
ET: It is often said that technology is going to be a great bridge in the credit gap that exists, especially when it comes to small and medium businesses. What is the role of AI in this? And personally, do you see that happening? It has been talked around for quite some time that the mobile revolution, and technology, would finally bridge the credit gap.
SS:
I think it is in the rear-view mirror. Take, for example, in India you can pay for street food like golgappas with Paytm. What does that do? It allows the person to develop credit, to have a bank account, to have financial data, and this did not happen by accident. You first had to create an identity, which was Aadhaar. You had to create a payment network, which was UPI. You had to create a policy to drive this adoption, to get technology partners to participate. This was a very deliberate exercise. Now, has that created an opportunity for a much broader financial inclusion? Absolutely.
So, I am working with several banks in India and around the globe where financial inclusion is an imperative, and we are providing them capabilities that are financial inclusion oriented.
ET: What do you spend time on now? What does your product pipeline look like and what are the things that you are working on?
SS:
We are very fortunate that we have a very broad suite of capabilities for financial services — everything from our cloud infrastructure, a lot of applications for running the back office, the mid office, and the front office, and very specific applications for the banking industry, product manufacturing for banking, core operations for banking, deposits, loans, all those systems, channel system. And we are working with 2,000 different banks across the globe in more than 100 countries.
Our job is to take all of these capabilities that we have had, modernise that architecture, make it available on the cloud, and infuse it with all the transformational technologies that our customers need. Our customers are running mainframe systems that were built in the 1970s. Many of the customers are still running them for their core operations. Now think about what has happened since then. The internet did not exist for commercial use in the 1970s and 1980s, social technologies did not exist, mobility did not exist, AI was a research paper at that time. So, as these customers need to adopt all of these capabilities, they need to move into modern systems and they have to look to companies like us to bring them those modern systems. Our job is to not only build those systems, but make them successful inside of our customers' environments, and that is what keeps us up at night.

Is math the path to chatbots that don't make stuff up?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/is-math-the-path-to-chatbots-that-dont-make-stuff-up/articleshow/113619293.cms,24-09-2024,"SAN FRANCISCO: On a recent afternoon,
Tudor Achim
gave a brain teaser to an artificial intelligence bot called Aristotle.
The question involved a 10-by-10 table filled with a hundred numbers. If you collected the smallest number in each row and the largest number in each column, he asked, could the largest of the small numbers ever be greater than the smallest of the large numbers?
The bot correctly answered ""No."" But that was not surprising. Popular chatbots such as
ChatGPT
may give the right answer, too. The difference was that Aristotle had proved that its answer was right. The bot generated a detailed computer program that verified ""No"" was the correct response.
Chatbots including ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google can answer questions, write poetry, summarize news articles and generate images. But they also make mistakes that defy common sense. Sometimes, they make stuff up -- a phenomenon called hallucination.
Achim, CEO and co-founder of a Silicon Valley startup called
Harmonic
, is part of growing effort to build a new kind of AI that never hallucinates. Today, this technology is focused on mathematics. But many leading researchers believe they can extend the same techniques into computer programming and other areas.
Live Events
Because
math
is a rigid discipline with formal ways of proving whether an answer is right or wrong, companies such as Harmonic can build AI technologies that check their own answers and learn to produce reliable information.
Google DeepMind, the tech giant's central AI lab, recently unveiled a system called AlphaProof that operates in this way. Competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad, the premier math competition for high schoolers, the system achieved ""silver medal"" performance, solving four of the competition's six problems. It was the first time a machine had reached that level.
""This is a path around hallucinations,"" said David Silver, a principal research scientist at Google DeepMind. ""Proof is a form of truth.""
Using similar techniques, some researchers believe they can eventually build an AI system that is better at math than any human. That's the goal of Achim and his co-founder Vlad Tenev, better known as CEO of online stock trading company Robinhood. Their new company, Harmonic, has raised $75 million in funding from Sequoia Capital and other investors.
Others, such as Silver, believe these techniques can extend even further, leading to AI systems that can verify physical truths as well as mathematical.
Around 2017, companies including Google, Microsoft and OpenAI began building large language models. These AI systems often spent months analyzing digital text culled from across the internet, including books, Wikipedia articles and chat logs. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems.)
By pinpointing patterns in all that text, these systems learned to generate text of their own, including term papers, poetry and computer code. They could even carry on a conversation.
But the technology also seemed dopey at times. It seemed to just spit out what it had learned from the internet -- unable to verify whether the information was right or wrong, real or completely made-up.
This month, OpenAI unveiled a new version of ChatGPT that was designed to reason through questions. It spends time ""thinking,"" trying different strategies in an effort to reach the right answer. But it still gets things wrong and makes stuff up.
Researchers such as Achim are beginning to address these problems through mathematics. With math, you can formally prove whether an answer is right or wrong.
About a decade ago, a Microsoft researcher named Leonardo de Moura created a computer programming language specifically for proving mathematical statements. Called Lean, this programming language was originally a tool for human mathematicians. But now that AI systems are skillful enough to generate their own computer code, they can also use Lean.
Harmonic is designing a large language model that can generate its own Lean proofs. The Lean code it generates is not always perfect. But through trial and error, it can learn to verify a solution.
""It is a lot like a human,"" Achim said. ""If you are trying to solve a math problem, you try certain steps. And if they fail, you try others, until you get them right.""
When Aristotle is asked to answer math problems, it can check the answers. These might be simple questions like ""What is 2+2?"" Or they might be more complex brain teasers like the one with the 10-by-10 grid of numbers.
""If the system can output an answer, it is basically guaranteed to be correct,"" Achim said.
As Aristotle checks its own answers, it becomes a way of generating enormous amounts of trustworthy digital data that can be used to teach AI systems. In other words, Aristotle can generate data that can be used to improve itself.
Researchers call this ""synthetic data"" -- data produced by AI that can then be used to train AI. Many researchers believe this concept will be a vital part of AI development.
Achim and Tenev believe that after years of training, Aristotle will be better at math than any human. ""We want it to be as smart as the collection of all the mathematicians in the world,"" Tenev said. ""We want it to solve problems that have never been solved.""
AI systems can use the same techniques to verify their own computer code, which relies heavily on mathematical logic. And if a system can generate reliable code, it can take actions on the internet. It becomes what researchers call an AI agent. As these AI systems improve, many researchers say, they could automate almost any digital work.
But researchers are quick to add that these AI systems have limits. Lean code can prove math theorems and verify computer code, but it cannot handle the complex ins and outs of daily life.
""Once you step out of the mathematical realm, things are very different,"" said Meta research scientist Angela Fan. There is often no absolute right and wrong that AI systems can learn to work toward as they do in mathematics.
Silver acknowledges this problem. But he also says there are verifiable truths in the real world. A rock is a rock. Sound travels at 343 meters per second. The sun sets in the west. If AI systems pull information from physical reality, it can verify these truths, too.
""Truth can come from the world,"" Silver said. ""If you can get feedback from world, you can improve and improve and improve."""
"AI, new geographies and SMBs to propel business, Oracle NetSuite India says",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/ai-new-geographies-and-smbs-to-propel-business-oracle-india-says/articleshow/113595002.cms,23-09-2024,"Large bets on AI, entering new geographies and tapping new business has enabled
Oracle India
to see robust growth across its offerings in the country.
“Some of our big bets and focus areas are growth in cloud and the ability to deliver value. GenAI is one area that customers want to leverage and we are seeing a lot of traction. We are capturing new markets, going into smaller cities and we continue to grow,” said
Premalakshmi PR
, vice president, Technology Cloud,
Oracle
India on the sidelines of Oracle CloudWorld 2024.
From a numbers perspective, Premalakshmi says cloud consumption in India has grown almost 58% year-on-year and the India unit has been able to add more than 10 logos in the public sector just last quarter. “Similarly, in the
SMB
space, our CAGR is 79% over the last three years. On cloud migration, we are still seeing customers wanting to move from on-premise to the cloud with sectors like banking and financials and healthcare, and newer sectors like fintech, NBFCs, cooperative banks, showing good traction,” said Premalakshmi.
Shailesh Singla, vice president, Cloud Applications, Oracle India said for India the company saw 38% growth in the customer experience (CX) business, “which is pretty steep for us, and we saw a 12% growth in the ERP numbers. The fintech and financial space has been a marquee space for us where we were adding about one customer every 3-4 weeks,” said Singla. Globally, the cloud business for Oracle has grown by 21% Y-O-Y, the ERP business has grown 16% and NetSuite has grown by 20%.
NetSuite expansions
Amit Suxena, Head of Asia,
Oracle NetSuite Global Business Unit
says Asia is a very diverse region where 60% of the world population lives and India is one of our key growth areas. “With the announcement of the data centers coming in next year, we would see a big acceleration,” said Suxena.
Live Events
Elaborating on the need for data centers in Indias, Suxena says there have been several companies that wanted their data to stay in India to meet local compliance norms.
Netsuite, Suxena says, has also gone in with a very aggressive geo expansion. “So far, we have been operating primarily out of Bangalore. Now we are going to all the cities in India. So, in the north, from Chandigarh to Jammu Kashmir, we are going to Kolkata in the east. We now have people based out of Kolkata, so overall, there has been a big geo expansion. We are expanding via our partner network in India primarily and we have lots of partners in each of these places and see a big opportunity,” Suxena says.
Netsuite expansion in India comes as it sees massive growth in the mid-market. “These are people who have not been on any kind of ERP systems so far. So, we see a lot of family businesses adopting our technology. They have been wanting a technology that is simple to use, where they don't have to think about HR systems, CRM or ERP systems. They wanted one solution and they are not technical experts. We are fast and easy to implement and that is something the mid-market customers in India like,” Suxena says,
Strategy difference
Dealing with SMBs needs a tweak in strategy and NetSuite says a lot of times it’s about educating companies about what is available. Suxena says people were scared of implementing an ERP solution which took forever to implement. “We pride ourselves on very simple, quick implementations. For us, it’s more of educating the market that ERP system implementation is not scary. On the other hand, large enterprises tend to have very long selection cycles and they have a ton of IT people doing it for them. The mid- market doesn’t, so the approach is different,” says Suxena.
Evan Goldberg, founder & executive vice president, NetSuite says the surge in demand for its services is driven by Indian companies with global aspirations and global operations.
“NetSuite is built to be global from the very beginning. It will allow a company to transact business in every country imaginable. So, if you have employees in different countries that need to use it in a different language, it is all covered. We are built-in ready for you to expand your business across the region, and ultimately across the globe. We see companies all over the world doing that earlier in their life cycle than ever before. This is because they can sell on the internet, because it has become more of a global economic marketplace. This is a big advantage we bring for smaller companies where they can compete with bigger companies that have the much more complex ERP systems,” says Goldberg.
Goldberg adds that he is a strong believer that AI is going to allow companies like NetSuite to deliver the real promise of a business system. “Here is one of the most important things about how NetSuite is implementing AI in its product - we are not charging for it. It is a big barrier to entry for some if one has to pay for these new capabilities the software companies introduce. A lot of current users will get immediate access to these capabilities. I believe that AI will help these businesses accelerate, especially the smaller ones that don’t have such a large employee population, and that’s what’s so exciting to me,” he says.
Rival, Salesforce Inc, unveiled its
artificial intelligence
strategy last week, but has a different approach for the market. It will charge $2 per conversation held by its new generative AI “agents”, a move that is widely seen as a tacit acknowledgement that AI can cause job losses in the future.

Who am AI? Rethinking leadership in the age of artificial intelligence,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/lessons-from-the-frontlines-rethinking-leadership-in-the-age-of-ai/articleshow/113523424.cms,20-09-2024,"In the past decade, as a social impact strategist, I have watched how artificial intelligence (
AI
) and other disruptive technologies are rapidly transforming our world. But as we enter this new era, the real challenge isn’t about technology—it’s about leadership. We need to rethink what it means to lead, live, and unlock
human potential
.
A central question arises: ""Who am AI?"" It's a modern twist on the ancient question, ""Who am I?"" While the original question focuses on inner transformation, ""Who am AI?"" asks us to consider how we can integrate our true selves with the vast possibilities AI offers, allowing us to redefine success, purpose, and meaning.
AI: A tool for growth, not just efficiency
AI isn’t just another tool—it’s a catalyst that can help us lead more purposeful, abundant lives. But as we navigate this period of rapid innovation, preserving our authenticity is more important than ever. The concept of ""Who am AI?"" offers a framework, built on four principles rooted in ancient wisdom, for using AI to enhance our humanity:
Seva:
Living a life of service
Sangha:
Building community
Sadhana:
Striving for self-mastery
Swadharma:
Following one’s true path
These principles can help us ensure that AI serves us, rather than diminishes our humanity.
From personal success to collective impact
Growing up, I asked myself,
""What is my purpose?""
I realized early on that true leadership is not about personal gain but about serving a cause greater than yourself. Today, AI tools like DigitalDeepak.ai and platforms like Millionways help us explore this type of leadership. These technologies guide
personal growth
, well-being, and align our strengths with the needs of our communities. AI is no longer just a digital assistant—it can become a partner in our leadership journey.

Imagine the possibilities of empowering people from all walks of life to become leaders who serve their communities with authenticity and courage.
Leadership in action: Lessons from the frontlines
In 2010, I worked on a global health initiative in the slums of Mumbai. The extreme poverty I saw was heartbreaking, but the resilience and grace of the people there left a lasting impact on me. It taught me that leadership isn’t about wealth or status; it’s about being respected and loved by the people you serve.
This kind of audacious leadership—rooted in service and adaptability—is what we need in today’s world.
Inner transformation and AI
Many of us chase material success, but as historian Yuval Noah Harari suggests, AI will reshape our world in ways we’ve never seen before. This shift requires us to rethink not only how we live but also how we find meaning. Inner transformation—requiring grit, discipline, and the ability to evolve—will be key.
AI can amplify our fears, but if applied thoughtfully, it can be a powerful tool for good. It can help us connect more deeply with others and serve our communities. AI’s true promise lies not in its technical capabilities but in its potential to enhance our empathy, creativity, and sense of purpose.
A call to bold leadership
In a world filled with uncertainty, fear can prevent us from embracing the opportunities AI offers. But just as the resilient communities in Mumbai chose to focus on what they could give rather than what they lacked, we too must see AI as a tool for transformation.
By integrating AI with human values, we have the chance to unlock our full potential.
Audacious leadership
, grounded in service, community, and purpose, will allow us to lift underserved communities and create a future of shared prosperity.
As we gather at forums like the 79th UNGA Summit, let’s remember our responsibility to the billions still underserved. By choosing love over fear and abundance over scarcity, we can create tangible, positive outcomes for both humanity and the planet.
In this new era where AI and humanity merge, the real question is: Who will we become, together?

Indian MarTech firm Infloso launches AI marketer Molly,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/indian-martech-firm-infloso-launches-ai-marketer-molly/articleshow/113452212.cms,18-09-2024,"Infloso
, an Indian
marketing tech
company, has introduced the world’s first
AI
marketer “Molly”.
Molly
is a supercharged AI marketer that trains itself on a brand’s entire digital footprint across the internet, and leverages real-time data intelligence to drive efficient, ROI-driven campaigns.
It harnesses cutting-edge
machine learning
techniques, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to analyse a dataset of over 1 billion data points. Additionally, Molly employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Image and Video Analysis to optimise visual content understanding and to extract actionable insights, combined with Predictive Analytics to forecast and fine-tune campaign performance. With its ability to autonomously optimise campaigns based on real-time performance metrics and market dynamics, Molly not only continuously elevates campaign efficiency but also enhances user control, allowing brands to integrate video, sales data, and customer insights to further amplify its capabilities.
In its official unveiling video, Molly showcases its ability to execute several tasks traditionally demanding significant human efforts and bandwidth. The video includes the demonstration of an earphone launch strategy—identifying the optimal date and market, and conducting competitive analysis for the launch.
In another example, Molly analyses a drop in daily sales and pinpoints the cause—a loading error on the billing page—leading to 119 customer dropouts.
In its debut version, Molly is equipped with the capability to comprehend and analyse data in 8 major languages: English, Hindi, German, Italian, French, Russian, Chinese, and Spanish.

Infloso’s Founder Utkarsh Khandelwal said in a statement, “Molly is well positioned to disrupt the marketing landscape, reducing brands’ dependencies on external partners, and empowering marketers. It is much faster and more efficient in doing the work that brands have traditionally relied on agencies for, coupled with better transparency and diligence. For example, an end-to-end campaign which marketing teams would typically take 7-10 days to strategise and execute, can be concluded by Molly in merely a couple of minutes — with significantly higher precision. Furthermore, founders have always had a tough time translating their vision into marketing and getting the right fit with an agency. With Molly, they can benefit with complete autonomy and control.”"
AI for MSMEs: Bridging the gap between technology and business goals is important,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/ai-for-msmes-bridging-the-gap-between-technology-and-business-goals-is-important/articleshow/113445071.cms,18-09-2024,"The transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) lies in its ability to automate tasks, analyse vast amounts of data, and make predictions and recommendations with unprecedented accuracy. For MSMEs, this can significantly enhance efficiency and decision-making across various operations.
According to a survey by the Ministry of MSMEs, 45% of MSMEs have adopted some form of AI in their operations, reflecting a growing interest in how AI can address their unique challenges. The
MSME sector
faces challenges in adopting new technologies due to limited financial and human resources.
Experts say that MSMEs can combine AI’s computational power with human intelligence to improve the business. The right approach and balance can help small businesses succeed in the digital era.
Payal Nambiar, Founder & Director of
B Square
, says that successfully implementing AI in the MSME sector requires a delicate balance. “Businesses must assess their specific needs, available resources and the long-term impact on their operations. A cautious, well-planned approach can help mitigate risks and unlock the true potential of AI-driven solutions.

Harnessing predictive tools to future-proof growth
Experts say that the future of business led by predictive tools is unfolding before our eyes, and tools of predictability and
digital automation
have emerged as the keys to unlocking unprecedented growth and adaptability.
Predictive analytics
and digital automation are especially powerful when navigating the ever-evolving business landscape. For MSMEs, leveraging these cutting-edge tools can be a game changer in anticipating market shifts and building resilience.
“By embracing digital automation and integrating comprehensive
business process management
solutions, such as
ERP
systems, along with resilience strategies, MSMEs can future-proof their operations, ensuring they are well-equipped to navigate the ever-changing market landscape. This holistic approach empowers businesses to anticipate challenges, seize opportunities and maintain a competitive edge — a true testament to the transformative power of technology in the MSME sector,” says Nambiar.
Aligning AI with business goals
AI is more than just a technological upgrade today; it’s a strategic necessity, experts point out. This means going beyond just implementing AI for specific tasks and truly understanding how it can drive business outcomes, such as improving customer experience, streamlining supply chains, optimising decision-making and predicting market trends.
Bhavesh Goswami, Founder and CEO of
CloudThat
, says that for MSMEs to thrive in the age of Industry 4.0,
AI adoption
cannot be an afterthought. “This transformation isn’t just about implementing AI tools, it’s about aligning AI solutions with strategic business objectives. As seen in recent cases, focusing solely on the technical aspects can lead to missed opportunities or even unintended consequences,” says Goswami.
But it requires a shift in mindset as the leadership has to embrace technology not as a disruption but as a catalyst for transformation. “To grow, an MSME must have adaptability and innovation in its DNA, and generative AI, in particular, provides the path forward. While resistance to new technology is natural, AI adoption within the MSME landscape is neither a top-down nor a bottom-up endeavour — it’s a joint effort. Leaders must understand the ‘why,’ and the operational team must execute the ‘how’ to ensure AI solutions are practical and impactful. This requires a strategic approach that goes beyond technical implementation and focuses on how AI can drive growth and transformation,” says Goswami.
Across the country, several new-age firms have already struck a balance between innovation and practicality. One such example is
mFilterIt
, led by Amit Relan, whose AI-driven solutions are turning out to be quite effective in finding ways for brands to protect their digital reputation. Relan says jumping on the AI bandwagon is beneficial for monitoring affiliate and influencer marketing campaigns, identifying safe ad placements, and ensuring compliance with advertising guidelines. Automating tasks such as ad traffic validation, lead quality assessment, and performance monitoring can enhance ROI and elevate brand reputation. “When integrated into operations, digital automation and resilience techniques can be a game changer. We use AI-ML-driven technology along with open-source intelligence (OSINT) to protect brand reputation across the digital ecosystem, ensuring contextual relevance in ad placements and preventing brand infringements,” adds the Co-Founder and CEO at the end-to-end ad fraud detection and prevention firm."

Tech integration and regulatory alignment crucial for banks’ growth: Maveric Systems,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/tech-integration-and-regulatory-alignment-crucial-for-banks-growth-maveric-systems/articleshow/113248651.cms,11-09-2024,"Indian banks must swiftly realign their portfolios and operational structures to keep pace with evolving global regulatory standards, according to a report by
Maveric Systems
.
The report sheds light on how innovation and technology are transforming financial institutions as they navigate increasingly stringent regulatory landscapes. Maveric Systems, which calls itself a specialist in
banktech
, highlights key strategies banks should adopt. It explains the need for Indian financial institutions to adopt cross-functional teams and establish stronger regulatory compliance (
regtech
plus banktech) frameworks to remain in sync with trends in the global banking sector.
With regulatory bodies around the world advancing toward more strategic, data-driven supervision, Indian banks must institutionalise systemic risk reporting and align with emerging technology standards. Failure to do so could see them fall further behind on the global stage, the report cautions.
“Regulators are expanding their focus to cover both financial and non-financial risks, including emerging areas such as
Basel IV
, environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics, and artificial intelligence (AI) guidelines,” says
P Venkatesh
, Director of Thought Leadership at Maveric Systems. “Indian regulators are making progress, but there is still a pressing need for banks to take proactive measures, including aligning with the stringent global standards set by leaders in
Europe
and the US.”
Europe is leading the charge in setting comprehensive technology standards, while India lags in digital financial ecosystems and crime prevention measures. Venkatesh also points out challenges in
payment
regulations and operational resilience that Indian banks must address by aligning with global best practices.
Live Events
He suggests that Indian banks consolidate to become globally systemic players — a move that would subject them to more international regulations and enhance their influence in the global financial system.
The report emphasises the importance of restructuring operations to ensure that Indian banks can meet the growing demands of regulatory alignment. This includes appointing a single leader responsible for overseeing compliance, implementing data structures that adhere to regulatory frameworks, and proactively engaging with regulators to understand evolving policies and technical standards.
The report urges Indian banks to proactively strengthen their financial crime intelligence capabilities, including creating a common database with other institutions, to prevent and detect financial crimes more effectively. Additionally, it recommends leveraging innovation labs to digitise policymaking and improve compliance.
According to Venkatesh, global financial regulation has evolved, particularly in the wake of the 2008 crisis and the Covid pandemic, bringing to the fore the role of various “innovation labs” and the unification of banktech regulations in a digital context. There is an acute need for aligning financial institutions with regulators, including digitisation of policymaking for better intelligence and implementation. This becomes critical as there are growing challenges in payment regulation, operational resilience, AI guidelines and the need for proactive measures in financial crime prevention.
Venkatesh says analytical applications, including behavioral sciences, deep neural networks,
blockchain
, Web3 risk mitigation, and forensics are achieving significant results, especially in the financial crime arena, and regulators needs to focus on how to spur technology integration, cross-functional collaborations and banktech related projects’ implementations.
P Venkatesh, Director - Though Leadership, Maveric Systems
Regulators are also enhancing their monitoring efforts to detect and prevent unethical practices such as greenwashing and money laundering/terrorist financing. While there is some level of coordination, there are differences in approach and timing across the US and European landscapes.
The report adds that regulators are making significant advances in strategic data-driven supervision for new risk lenses, which require sharing information. It further emphasises that the next five years are shaping up to be the most strategic period of regulatory reform for industry data since the financial crisis. Meeting any regulatory requirement will demand sourcing, capturing, processing, and reporting information. Therefore, it is important to connect data from multiple sources — across business lines, enabling functions, and external data.
“In terms of best practices globally, India’s financial ecosystem has areas where it performs well, but it also has areas where it lags behind,” Venkatesh says. “For instance, how many banks from India are in the top 20 globally? Not many. China has six.”
According to the latest rankings, there are six Chinese banks and zero Indian banks among the top 20 banks in the world by total assets. Indian banks, while being significant in their own domestic domain, are yet to break into the top 20."

IT firm CSM Tech to design HR management system for Gambia,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/it-firm-csm-tech-to-design-hr-management-system-for-gambia/articleshow/112645824.cms,20-08-2024,"CSM Tech
, an Indian IT company, has bagged a contract by the Ministry of Finance & Economic Affairs (MoFEA) to design and implement a comprehensive HRMIS as part of the
Gambia
Fiscal Management Development Project (GFMDP).
CSM Tech won the bid and contracted to prepare a strategy for roll out of the system across all Ministries and Departments and Institutions within the framework of The Republic of Gambia.
The integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into The Gambia's government sector represents a significant shift in the country's approach to governance and economic development. This transition, which began in the late 1990s and early 2000s, marks a strategic recognition of technology's potential to revolutionise public service delivery and drive economic growth. It serves as a case study for other developing nations, illustrating both the potential benefits and challenges of rapid technological adoption in governance and economic planning.
Priyadarshi Nanu Pany
, Founder and CEO of CSM Tech said in a statement, ""By implementing a state-of-the-art HRMIS, we're not just streamlining processes; we're laying the foundation for a more efficient, transparent, and responsive government. We're proud to be at the forefront of The Gambia's digital transformation, helping to create a model for public sector modernisation across the region.""
Asit Mohanty, Senior Manager (HR) of CSM Tech said in a statement, “Our HRMIS project in The Gambia exemplifies CSM Tech's commitment to global digital transformation. By modernising human resource management in the public sector, we are empowering an entire nation to make data-driven decisions about its most valuable asset- people”.

The project is a component of the broader Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS) initiative. IFMIS encompasses core financial management, expenditure management, revenue management, general ledger, budgeting, and HR and payroll functions."
Artificial Intelligence helped to find a vast source of the copper that AI needs to thrive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/artificial-intelligence-helped-to-find-a-vast-source-of-the-copper-that-ai-needs-to-thrive/articleshow/111677093.cms,12-07-2024,"CHILILABOMBWE,
ZAMBIA
: Peering into their computer screens in California last year, the data crunchers watched a subterranean fortune come into focus.
What they saw transported them 10,000 miles across the world, to Zambia, and then 1 more mile straight down into Earth. A rich lode of
copper
, deep in the bedrock, appeared before them, its contours revealed by a complex artificial intelligence-driven technology they had been painstakingly building for years.
On Thursday, their company,
KoBold Metals
, informed its business partners that their find is likely the largest copper discovery in more than a decade. According to their estimates, reviewed by The New York Times, the mine would produce at least 300,000 tons of copper a year once fully operational. That corresponds to a value of billions of dollars a year, for decades.
The Times also reviewed an independent, third-party assessment of KoBold's claims, which, while slightly more conservative than KoBold's own, largely corroborated the size of the deposit. In a statement, KoBold said it expected the value of the mine to grow because it had yet to map the full extent of its highest-grade ore.
It's the first confirmed success for a company that hopes to radically transform the way we find metals critical not only to the tech industry but to the fight against climate change. The geopolitical significance is vast. KoBold's find comes as the United States and China are increasingly clashing over global access to the minerals needed to manufacture clean energy technologies.
Live Events
KoBold originated a half-decade ago in the belated realization among Silicon Valley's barons of what lay ahead.
Their products had become the backbone of the U.S. economy. But their businesses couldn't grow much further without a gargantuan increase in the mining of a handful of raw materials that make batteries, without which everything from cellphones to electric trucks simply can't function. They needed far more copper, cobalt, lithium and nickel.
Hundreds of new mines would be necessary, analysts calculated. And not just for consumer products, but for the house-size lithium-ion batteries needed for backup on the nation's power grids as solar and wind power ebbs and flows.
NYT News Service
KoBold Metals workers photograph core samples in Chililabombwe, Zambia, June 12, 2024.
AI data centres
demand huge amounts of copper. Advanced weaponry requires nickel and cobalt.
Over two decades of production, KoBold's find in Zambia would yield enough copper for 100 million of today's average-size electric vehicle batteries.
""The more you realize how dependent we are on these technologies, the more you ask: How the hell were we so slow to the fact that we needed vast amounts of raw material to make it all possible?"" said
Connie Chan
, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the biggest venture capital firm in the United States and an early investor in KoBold.
The traditional mining industry lacked a convincing solution. Using exploration techniques largely unchanged in a century, the cost of new discoveries was rising while the pace of the finds slowed.
Around the same time, the U.S. government had a similar lightbulb moment. America had become far too reliant on China for these essential resources.
China had been heavily investing in global mining and metal processing, and controlled the production of 20% to 80% of its supply chains. The United States, on the other hand, has relatively few processing plants or mines, domestic or foreign, for most battery metals.
The International Energy Forum, a research organization, recently estimated that the world would need between 35 and 194 large new mines for copper alone through 2050. That translates to between one and six new copper mines, every year, the size of the one KoBold plans to dig in Zambia.
Investors from American and European private equity funds that collectively manage trillions of dollars in assets, including ones started by Silicon Valley giants such as Bill Gates and Sam Altman of OpenAI, were joined by more traditional industrial companies in putting hundreds of millions of dollars into KoBold.
It already has 60-odd exploration projects in various countries. In some cases, such as Zambia, where production is expected to begin in the early 2030s, it plans to own stakes in the mines themselves.
Its CEO and co-founder,
Kurt House
, embraces the moneymaking potential of KoBold's technology, which is the company's alone to profit from. He is fond of saying, ""I don't need to be reminded again that I'm a capitalist.""
The work is about to get a lot less theoretical.
KoBold is pumping $2.3 billion into its first mine and is negotiating tricky partnerships with contractors and governments alike. It is relying on the U.S. government to finance a new railway to export the copper. And, like the mining barons of yore, its leaders will soon be exposed to the social and environmental trade-offs that almost all mining poses.
Mining and Muon Detectors
On a quiet residential street in Oakland, California, Tom Hunt, who leads a team of data scientists at KoBold, gathered colleagues on Zoom. His setup was quintessentially white-collar. He and his wife, Lauren, share a work-from-home space. When he got animated explaining something, she peeked in from the porch.
The few clues to his life and work were on his desk, where a miniature model of the copper find in Zambia sat below a note from Lauren saying how much she loved him.
Beaming in from Southern California was Daniel Snowden-Ifft, head of the physics department at Occidental College in Los Angeles. He had dedicated much of his career to looking for dark matter. ""I spent 20 years and never found any,"" he said. Now, he's developing a device that KoBold might use to find especially valuable members of the periodic table.
His gadget would be lowered into a drill hole, from where it would identify muons, which are infinitesimal subatomic particles, and send back density readings of the hidden underground world.
NYT News Service
From left: Daniel Snowden-Ifft, Alvaro Loya and Jean-Luc Gauvreau prepare to lower the muon detector, which shoots out infinitesimal subatomic particles (muons) and sends back density readings, into a bore hole for test on the campus of Occidental College in Los Angeles, May 22, 2024.
It's a technique that would be new to mining, but it has a proven, if unusual, record. Previously, it has been used to suss out the location of burial chambers in Egyptian pyramids. Researchers have studied its potential for pinpointing illegal cross-border tunnels.
The muon detector is at the futuristic end of KoBold's growing database, TerraShed. At the other are yellowing paper maps and typewritten reports gathering cobwebs in Zambia's mining archives, many a century old or more, which KoBold is digitising. Elsewhere, KoBold collects its own radar and magnetic readings by flying modified Cessnas over promising territory.
TerraShed includes tens of millions of documents that can be overlaid to yield 3D models of what might lie below.
""We think we're mostly done with the easy era of mining,"" said Hunt, who joined KoBold after working at Google and other Silicon Valley companies.
KoBold's discovery is a case in point. The area of Zambia where it was found is known for copper. In fact, its name is Copperbelt province. Still, nobody had been able to home in on this mile-deep vein until KoBold did, right under everyone's noses.
The economies of Zambia and its colonial-era predecessor, Northern Rhodesia, have long been defined by copper, a material that humans have sought for millennia. Well before wire heralded the modern age of electricity, copper was essential to Bronze Age toolmaking. Many of Zambia's best mines were originally spotted simply because colonial officials noticed that local people had already been mining them, sometimes for centuries.
Finding other battery metals will present bigger challenges.
Lithium, for instance, wasn't widely sought until a few decades ago. House said this was exactly why the exploration industry needed to get creative. ""We don't drill for metals, we drill for information,"" he said. ""It puts the science into eureka.""
House estimated that TerraShed contained about 3% of the world's available geological data.
Back on Hunt's Zoom screen, Audrey Lawrence, who manages TerraShed, raised her hands above her head and spread them out in trying to explain how big 3% already is. In doing so, she set off Zoom's automatic fireworks reaction.
Will Zambians Benefit?
KoBold's find looks like a proof of concept with potentially huge payout for investors. And the company's partners include Zambia itself: The state mining company owns 20%.
That Zambians will benefit, though, is far from a foregone conclusion. Mining has left waste piled across Copperbelt province, spawning lawsuits. One case alleges that local rivers at one point ran bright blue with copper tailings. And despite a century of mining, Zambia remains one of the world's least-developed and most-indebted countries.
""The value of copper that has left Zambia is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Hold that figure in your mind, and then look around yourself in Zambia,"" said Grieve Chelwa, a Zambian economist. ""The link between resource and benefit is severed.""
KoBold's biggest investors are the heirs of that legacy of inequity. Copper from Zambia helped build the economies on which Silicon Valley fortunes are based. KoBold says it aims to uplift local communities, and has attracted some of Zambia's top geologists back to the country from overseas.
But given the specific type of mine KoBold plans to dig, it's unclear if many locals will get hired. Underground mines, like this one will be, typically employ far fewer people than open-pit mines.
Kennedy Bondola, 40, worked in a nearby open-pit mine for 15 years before it was nearly exhausted. He lives in Kawama, a village directly above KoBold's find. Kawama is poor but resourceful. Its main road was busy with welders repairing household goods on a recent afternoon. Bar owners brewed their own liquor. Others smuggled maize flour into Congo, a mile or two away, where it can fetch double the price.
With a new mine, Bondola said, there was only one way Kawama could go: up. ""Maybe it will become a real town,"" he said.
KoBold's team is still determining exactly where to dig the mine's shaft. There is a lake directly above the ore, and a major highway, along with the village of Kawama.
""For a find this valuable, there's nothing on the surface we can't move,"" said George Gilchrist, a South African geologist who is leading KoBold's exploration in Zambia.
NYT News Service
KoBold Metals workers take detailed measurements of core samples to enter into a database, in Chililabombwe, Zambia, June 12, 2024.
In an interview in the capital, Lusaka, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema said one way to ensure greater benefits was for his country to own more of the mine. He said he was pressing KoBold to increase the share owned by the state mining company to above one-third. The extra money ""will allow us to invest in sectors that ordinarily are difficult for us,"" he said.
Hichilema is desperate for revenue.
More than one-third of his budget goes toward repaying international debts, leaving little for health and education. Most of the capital gets only a few hours of electricity per day. It will take more than a slightly bigger stake in one mine, however large the mine may be, to solve that.
""The benefits of this mine for Zambia,"" Chelwa said, ""are purely theoretical at this point.""
For the United States government, the benefits are far more clear.
""We are the American beachhead in Africa,"" said Jennifer Fendrick, KoBold's director for government affairs. ""And that's how the government sees it."" Before joining KoBold, she was a senior U.S. State Department strategist on critical minerals.
Although the U.S. government hasn't directly invested in KoBold, it is partially underwriting a $2.3 billion railway to the Angolan coast from Copperbelt province, enabling copper to be more easily be shipped to the United States. It's the United States' single-biggest investment to catch up to China in Africa's battery-metal sweepstakes.
Recently, House prepared to meet face-to-face with Hichilema. He was accompanied by his main investors along with Linnisa Wahid, the acting U.S. ambassador. House, wearing a lapel pin with the U.S. and Zambian flags, asked for Wahid's help when he brought up the railway.
""Your affirmation at that moment would be great,"" he said.
While U.S. mining interests in Zambia are progressing, accessing neighboring Congo's cobalt reserves is trickier. China-based companies own or have major stakes in most cobalt-producing sites in Congo, which produced 76% of the world's supply last year.
Biden administration officials are debating whether to lift sanctions on a billionaire Israeli mining executive accused of creating a web of corrupt practices in Congo's mines. The sanctions have dissuaded American companies from investing there.
There are other ways the United States could procure battery metals, but they face big obstacles. Parts of the seabed are rich in critical minerals, but a dispute has raged for years over how, or whether, oceans should be mined. And more mines could be opened within the United States itself, but that prospect has drawn objections, particularly from Indigenous communities.
Whether the United States sticks with its climate goals also hinges on this year's presidential election. A win by former President Donald Trump would very likely severely curtail energy transition incentives.
For now, the Biden administration is pushing ahead.
""We need 25 times as much cobalt as we currently mine,"" Jose W. Fernandez, the State Department's top energy official, said in an interview in New York recently, not to mention all the other metals and minerals reshaping the global economy. ""We've got to get into the ring. We'll be skewered if we fail."""

Industry observers often grapple with a key question: Should AI adoption be led by the leadership team or the operational teams within an organisation? There are no straightforward answers to it.
Experts point out that leaders have a pivotal role in empowering individuals, a responsibility that extends beyond implementing new technology. They emphasise the vital role of leadership in creating a harmonious environment for AI’s success and ensuring team members remain in sync. To effectively embrace AI technologies, they also recommend leaders prioritise upskilling and reskilling of their workforce.

Dilip Sawhney, managing director, Rockwell Automation India, says leadership is crucial in defining the vision; making strategic decisions; and creating a conducive environment for successful AI adoption and implementation. The leadership’s role in adopting AI in manufacturing is to push for change, maintain a balance between people and technology, and overcome barriers for tech adoption.
“Leaders play a critical role in driving AI adoption. They should focus not only on implementing AI technology but also on considering the impact on the workforce. They must expect and have a plan to overcome obstacles that organisations may face in the next 12 months. These obstacles include assessing business and technology/talent fit, effectively managing people and resources, and attracting and retaining a quality workforce. Addressing these challenges is crucial for successfully adopting AI and driving positive business outcomes,” says Sawhney.
Leadership sets the vision while teams implement the innovation
Based on the best practices in AI adoption, several teams are typically involved. This involves not only the leadership team but also executives and senior managers. They play a vital role in establishing the vision, strategy and goals for AI implementation, and also the necessary resources, support and guidance to drive the adoption process.
For example, there is a data science team comprising data scientists, machine learning engineers and AI specialists at any organisation leveraging AI. The team develops and implements AI models, algorithms and solutions. These people work on data collection, preprocessing, model training and evaluation to ensure the successful deployment of AI technologies. Besides, the operations team — including manufacturing engineers and process experts — plays a critical role in integrating AI technologies into existing manufacturing processes.
Additionally, AI adoption often requires collaboration across various departments and functions within an organisation. These cross-functional teams may include representatives from operations, IT, data science, quality assurance, supply chain and other relevant areas. They work together to align AI initiatives with business objectives, share domain knowledge, and ensure the successful implementation and integration of AI technologies.
Need for a balanced approach
Another aspect worth considering is the need for a balanced approach between leadership and involved teams in driving AI adoption. The question here is how would this equilibrium be defined.
Sankar Chakraborti, Group CEO &MD of Acuité, says, “When an organisation wants to use technology that has disruptive potential, it is very important that leadership and the operational team work hand in hand. While AI throws up tremendous opportunities, it also will bring risks. Cost savings, operational efficiency, mitigation of people risk and finding new and better solutions will drive breakthroughs in AI. But faster obsolescence of technologies, job losses, and risks to IT security will necessitate regulatory oversight. In this scenario, strategic leadership should be provided by CXOs in carefully evaluating the risks and benefits.”
Given the realities on the ground for firms utilising AI, Sawhney from Rockwell India asserts that teams play a vital role in the adoption of AI. Their primary function is to collaborate and work collectively with teams to ensure that AI solutions align with business needs, are technically feasible and deliver the desired outcomes. These teams play a crucial role in data preparation, model development, system integration, monitoring, and continuous improvement of AI systems in manufacturing.
Sriram Kanuri, CEO & Founder of Arteria, says, “Seniors should drive AI adoption, setting the vision and strategic priorities for the organisation. However, teams on the ground must be deeply involved in the implementation, more so in the case of AI. It will allay any fears around job losses. By fostering a collaborative environment where leadership provides direction and teams bring their practical insights, organisations can harness the full potential of AI.”
This dual approach ensures that AI initiatives are both visionary and grounded in operational reality, leading to meaningful transformation and sustained competitive advantage.
Experts state that the combination of visionary thinking and practical application in AI initiatives leads to increased productivity. Such a collaborative model leverages the strengths of both leadership and teams, driving successful AI integration across the organisation and reinforcing the positive outcomes of collaboration.
Gopichand Katragadda, President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), is of the view that leadership vision is critical in setting the strategic objectives for AI adoption and establishing robust GAI policies to safeguard the company and its customers. He suggests leaders establish a clear vision and framework to ensure that AI initiatives are in line with the organisation’s goals. This top-down approach, he says, is essential for creating a cohesive strategy that addresses both opportunities and potential risks associated with AI.
“Yet, the tactical implementation and innovative ideas for AI applications should primarily emerge from the operational teams and individual contributors. These teams, with their intimate familiarity with the specific needs and challenges of their domains, can identify practical applications for AI that leadership might overlook. This bottoms-up push not only enables a more agile and responsive approach to AI adoption but also fosters a culture of innovation, highlighting the unique value of operational teams in driving innovation,” he adds."
Regulations have an important role to play in the realm of digital assets: Propine’s Tuhina Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/regulations-have-an-important-role-to-play-in-the-realm-of-digital-assets-propines-tuhina-singh/articleshow/111568661.cms,08-07-2024,"The proliferation of
digital assets
has generated the need to ensure mitigation of risks and safety of everything, from cryptos to NFTs. The space, however, is not easy to understand and can be overwhelming for users.
Propine
, a licensed digital asset custodian headquartered in Singapore is engaged in transforming how digital assets are stored and traded by providing secure and scalable solutions for qualified institutional clients. In a chat with ETDigital,
Tuhina Singh
, Founder & CEO, Propine. Talks about what her company provides, the trends in the digital asset space, risks associated with
blockchain
and the role of regulators. Edited excerpts.
Economic Times (ET): When did Propine start and what was the idea behind it?
Tuhina Singh (TS):
Founded in 2018, Propine has been involved in the blockchain space since 2015. Recognising the transformative potential of smart contracts and blockchain technology for enterprises across various sectors, we anticipated a future where these innovations would redefine business operations and value transfer.
As digital assets mature, institutional investors start moving markets, and financial firms tokenise previously illiquid asset classes such as corporate bonds, real estate, private equity, funds, art, natural resources, and derivatives – they would all need access to institutional infrastructure, particularly custody, to enable them.
Therefore, Propine was established with the vision to offer a regulated, institutional-grade digital asset custody service that ensures the safe, compliant, and efficient management of digital assets. The company caters to institutional investors who require high standards of security and regulatory compliance.
Live Events
ET: What does the company provide today?
TS:
Today, Propine offers a comprehensive suite of services, including:
Digital Asset Custody
: Secure storage and protection of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, NFTs, and fiat.
Asset Servicing
: Management of corporate actions, income distribution, and investor reporting.
Trade Settlement Facilitation
: Efficient transaction processing and settlement.
Tokenisation Solutions
: Through the DASH
platform, Propine offers end-to-end asset lifecycle management, including token issuance and smart securities enabling automated cross-border transfers.
Regulatory Compliance
: ISO 27001 and SOC Type II certified, licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Propine ensures compliance with all relevant regulations in this fast-evolving space.
ET: Who are your customers and how do they benefit from a service like yours?
TS:
Propine's customers include institutional investors such as banks, asset managers, exchanges, blockchain protocols, fintech platforms, wealth managers and high-net-worth individuals.
To fully harness the potential of new technologies, both corporations and individuals must securely store and transfer their digital assets within a framework that is compliant with regulations and legally robust.
Existing solutions often require individuals and businesses to sacrifice either security or convenient accessibility. Several other concerns that crop up, include, but are not limited to:
considerable lack of scalability in such solutions,
manual intervention that creates opportunities for collusion and insider theft,
potential single point failures,
poor auditability of processes,
mutable audit logs rendering them unreliable, and
any attempt at increasing resilience commensurately increases the attack vectors.
When customers depend on such unlicensed, unregulated and uninsured solutions, it creates large swathes of under-appreciated regulatory risks and commercial liabilities for them.
As digital assets increasingly integrate into our daily lives and professional environments, it is imperative to establish infrastructure that ensures secure and compliant transactions. This framework should operate within a well-established legal structure that has proven its reliability over time. Among all industries, financial services face the greatest risk of disruption today, with every aspect of their operations—from deposits and lending to trading, clearing, settlement, remittances, payments, and asset management services—being challenged.
A regulated, institutionally robust digital asset custody service like Propine, underpins all these vertically integrated markets. Loss of control of an account’s private keys through cyber-attack or an operational mishap can result in irreversible asset loss. Our clients thus benefit from working with a partner that future proofs their business from all regulatory, operational and technical risks.
ET: The biggest issue for the sector has been around trust and security. How do you ensure that on the platform?
TS:
Propine ensures trust and security through advanced technology and robust infrastructure. It utilises IBM HSM at the core which is FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified, quantum-resistant key management, programmable non-tamper-able policy engines, protected memory enclaves and a dual-layer multi-signature system to protect against cyber-attacks, phishing attempts, manual, human errors and internal collusion.
Propine also conducts comprehensiveandregular security audits by reputable firms like PwC, NCC Group, and Deloitte. Propine has procured insurance from the best names in the industry and is fully licensed by MAS and ISO 27001 + SOC Type II certified.
ET: Cryptos have been a gray area with several regulators. How do you navigate the regulatory hurdles and ensure compliance with various laws?
TS:
Propine has been very prescient about the growth of the digital asset ecosystem and the regulatory challenges that the market will eventually face. The company has actively collaborated with MAS and other global regulators to stay ahead of compliance requirements. In fact we started engaging with regulators as early as 2018 with an intention of setting up a licensed solution when pretty much rest of the industry was looking the other way, and vying to set up business outside of regulatory ambit to avoid scrutiny of their operations. Our active discussions led to Propine becoming the first and only company to enter a sandbox managed by MAS and we graduated from it with full license.
ET: When it comes to
Bitcoin
, we have seen several crashes. Do you think regulations could have prevented that? How do you ensure there is a balance between regulation and allowing innovations to happen?
TS:
Creation of clear regulatory frameworks for new financial assets, such as digital assets, ensures that market participants understand the rules and their responsibilities, which fosters trust and participation. It is a clear sign of a maturing market.
Appropriate regulations have an important role to play to prevent extreme crashes and reduce volatility.
Regulations ensure there is a watchdog to monitor trading activities, to detect and prevent market manipulation, insider trading, and fraudulent activities. When irregularities are detected, these bodies have the authority to take enforcement actions, including fines, trading halts, and legal actions against violators. FTX and Three Arrows are high profile examples of such enforcement.
They protect investors by reducing information disparity between investors via enforcing material disclosure requirements on the companies. Additionally, regular and timely reporting increases transparency, allowing investors to make informed decisions, reducing speculation-driven volatility.
Suitable circuit breakers on trading venues, applied correctly, are proven methods to halt panic selling in a significant decline. Similarly, capital adequacy reserves help to cushion against significant losses, ensuring service providers remain solvent during market downturns.
Trading rules and short selling regulations can prevent excessive downward pressure on assets during periods of market stress. Margin requirements can prevent build of excessive leverage which can amplify market volatility.
Regulators often engage in educating investors about the risks and opportunities associated with new financial assets, ensuring that they make informed decisions. Regulations attract institutional investors by ensuring that the market operates fairly and transparently, bringing in significant liquidity and expertise which increases market depth, thereby reducing volatity. Finally, establishing standard practices and norms for new financial assets helps in creating a level playing field and reducing operational risks
However, it is equally, if not more important, to balance regulation with innovation. Here are some of the things steps and frameworks regulators as well as companies can take, to balance the risks, investor protection and innovation:
Open Dialogue
: Companies need to work with regulators to create rules that protect investors without stifling innovation.
Adaptive Compliance
: Continuously updating compliance practices to align with evolving regulatory landscapes while fostering technological advancement.
Sandboxes:
Initiatives like regulatory sandboxes allow new financial technologies to be tested in a controlled environment, promoting innovation while ensuring regulatory oversight.
Standard Practices
: Establishing standard practices and norms for new financial assets helps in creating a level playing field and reducing operational risks.
In conclusion, the regulation of financial markets plays a crucial role in preventing extreme crashes, reducing market volatility, and facilitating the maturation of new financial asset markets. By ensuring transparency, protecting investors, and fostering innovation within a clear legal framework, regulations help create a stable and trustworthy financial environment.
ET: Cryptos and Blockchain have been around for some time now. Blockchain, particularly, holds a lot of promise. However, we still see very limited adoption of the technology across sectors. What is stopping the tech from being more widely accepted?
TS:
Several factors hinder wider adoption of blockchain technology:
Regulatory Uncertainty
: Inconsistent regulations across jurisdictions create barriers to adoption. The regulatory environment is also continuously evolving, making it challenging for businesses to keep up and ensure compliance.
Scalability Issues
: Current blockchain solutions often struggle with scalability, affecting their ability to handle large volumes of transactions. High transaction volumes can lead to network congestion, increasing transaction times and fees.
Integration Challenges
: Many blockchain networks operate in isolation, lacking interoperability with other blockchains and existing financial systems. Integrating blockchain with legacy systems is complex and costly.
Environmental concerns
: Many blockchain networks, particularly Bitcoin, use PoW consensus mechanisms, which are energy-intensive. The high energy consumption of blockchain networks raises environmental concerns, leading to negative perceptions and regulatory scrutiny.
Complexity and Usability
: The technical complexity of blockchain technology can be a barrier to entry for both developers and end-users. Further, blockchain applications lack user-friendly interfaces, making them difficult for non-technical users to navigate.
Security Concerns
: While blockchain itself is secure, the surrounding infrastructure (e.g., exchanges, wallets) can be vulnerable to hacking which deters users from participating.
Cultural and Organisational Resistance
: Organisations may be resistant to adopting new technologies due to the cost, complexity, limited understanding of blockchain among decision makers, and cultural shift required.
ET: What significant trends are you observing in the digital asset industry in Asia?
TS:
In Asia, Major financial institutions, including banks and asset managers, are increasingly participating in the digital asset space. This is driven by the potential for high returns and the growing acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate asset class.
Countries like Singapore and Japan are leading the way in establishing clear regulatory frameworks that provide legal clarity and foster investor confidence. This has spurred technological advancements and innovations in blockchain technology, such as improved scalability and interoperability.
DeFi platforms are also gaining significant traction in Asia, offering innovative financial services such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming without traditional intermediaries. This trend is particularly strong in countries with robust fintech ecosystems like Singapore and Hong Kong. Regulators are beginning to engage with DeFi projects to understand their impact and potential risks, aiming to balance innovation with consumer protection.
There is a growing interest in tokenizing real-world assets such as bonds, real estate, commodities, and art. This allows for fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and broader investor access.
Similarly, more businesses are accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, driven by the increasing consumer demand for digital payment options. This trend is especially evident in tech-savvy markets like South Korea and Japan. Companies are developing integrated payment solutions that combine traditional and digital assets, providing seamless transaction experiences for users.
Companies are leveraging blockchain for supply chain management to enhance transparency, traceability, and efficiency. This is particularly prominent in sectors such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and electronics.
We also see early emergence of secure and tamper-proof digital identities on the blockchain to streamline KYC processes and reduce fraud. For example,Selfkey, is a blockchain-based identity platform used by financial institutions and government bodies in Asia.
ET: How do you foresee the growth trajectory of digital assets in the region in the coming years?
TS:
The digital asset market in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is poised for significant growth in the coming years, driven by several key factors. Continued development of clear and supportive regulations. Growing involvement of institutional investors, asset managers and banks will provide stability and credibility.
Innovations in blockchain technology are addressing scalability issues, making it possible to handle larger volumes of transactions efficiently. Layer-2 solutions and improved consensus mechanisms are examples of such advancements.Development of interoperability solutions that allow different blockchain networks to communicate and operate together seamlessly is enhancing the utility and adoption of blockchain technology.
ET: What future trends in digital assets are you most excited about, and why?
TS:
I am personally most excited about the disruption in value transfer space. The very concept of “value” which is today captured in monetary terms alone, will be expanded. This will allow unbundling and monetization of different types of values, creating new economic opportunities. It will have a ripple effect on how businesses and their customers interact. Add the progress in AR/VR to it and we will see entirely new business models emerge for immersive customer experiences."
Why AI's future is Indian: SenseAI survey shows how India is at a turning point,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/why-ais-future-is-indian-senseai-survey-shows-how-india-is-at-a-turning-point/articleshow/110958391.cms,13-06-2024,"The most common hurdles in
AI
adoption include cost, complexity and limited understanding of AI's implications, a
survey
by AI fund
SenseAI
Ventures stated. In terms of the technologies used by the surveyed startups,
cloud
took the lead, followed closely by OpenAI's GPT-4o.
The AI fund also announced the launch of a whitepaper, ""Artificial Intelligence: Beyond the Hype,"" alongwith the survey results. To complement the whitepaper, SenseAI had conducted a survey of around 100
startup
founders in
India
who work in the AI space. The survey findings provide insights into the current state and prospects of AI in India.
One of the key revelations of the survey was that
SaaS
(software as a service) has emerged as the dominant business model among the startups, indicating a growing preference for cloud-based AI solutions. The survey also highlighted a moderate demand for customised AI solutions among the clients of these startups, suggesting an increasing recognition of AI's potential to address specific business needs.
Rahul Agarwalla, Managing Partner at SenseAI, says that two areas where Indian founders can create a real global niche for themselves are SaaS and AI tooling. “If you look at enterprise software SaaS, you will find very low adoption rates outside of the rich countries. One of the key reasons we found is that pricing is in dollars, so it's expensive when your per capita GDP is not what it is in the western advanced economies,” he says.
Agarwalla adds that this is also due to the fact that in India or any of the countries with lower software adoption rates, people did not grow up with
technology
at home. “So people resisted adopting technology. AI completely changes that, the best example would be Zoho and how adoption of Zoho has happened across the world in all countries where incomes are lower. So it is a big opportunity,” he says.

Besides this, he talks about AI tooling as another opportunity that must be tapped due to the large talent pool that exists. “We understand exactly firsthand what the challenges are in using AI. And these challenges and problems are the same globally. And because we have so many talented AI engineers who understand these problems and are coming up with solutions to solve those problems, you will see a massive outburst of world beating companies in AI tooling,” he says.
In terms of some of the most significant risks associated with AI, the survey respondents identified security, bias, and data availability/readiness. On a more optimistic note, the respondents singled out Explainable AI (XAI), AI agents and quantum computing as the emerging technologies and trends that can create the most impact in the future.
The whitepaper and survey also underscored the transformative potential of AI across various sectors. Investment in AI within healthcare was projected to reach $18.8 billion by 2027, highlighting AI's role in diagnostic and analytical applications. The AI fraud management sector was forecast to grow from a $10.4 billion valuation in 2023 to $57.1 billion by 2033, with an annual growth rate of 18.5%.
The expanding capabilities and decreasing costs of AI signal a surge in AI applications, poised to redefine productivity and transform job markets. Research indicates that AI-adopting firms are on track to double their market share, with efficiency gains potentially reaching tenfold by 2024.
As Agarwalla adds, “We are at a turning point where AI is no longer just a buzzword, but a force that will reshape industries, economies and societies in ways we can barely imagine. India has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lead this change and win.”"

Having established Generative AI's transformative power, it's clear that this technology isn't just a ""nice to have"" for CEOs – it's a strategic imperative. Leading your organization into the Generative AI era requires a deliberate and well-defined plan. Here are some key steps CEOs can take to navigate this transformative landscape and unlock the immense potential of Generative AI.
Equipping Leaders for the AI Era: A CEO's Toolkit
The first step in any CEO's Generative AI journey is a mindset shift. Move beyond viewing AI solely as an automation tool for replacing tasks. Generative AI's true power lies in augmenting human capabilities. Imagine AI-powered design tools that spark creative leaps, or marketing platforms that craft hyper-personalized campaigns with human-like intuition and AI-powered assistants that can answer employee questions and streamline workflows. By fostering this collaborative approach, CEOs unlock a future where humans and AI work in tandem to achieve extraordinary results.
Now, let's bridge the gap between theory and practice. Generative AI offers a treasure trove of business value for CEOs. Executives can expect to see significant efficiency improvements, with AI handling repetitive tasks and freeing up valuable human time for strategic endeavours. Product development cycles shrink as AI accelerates the design and prototyping process. Customer experiences become hyper-personalized, leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty. Employees benefit too, with AI streamlining workflows and empowering them to focus on higher-order thinking. Furthermore, generative models can analyse vast amounts of data, uncovering valuable insights that would be impossible to glean through traditional methods.
From Vision to Action
So, how do CEOs translate this potential into reality? The roadmap begins with identifying concrete use cases. Where can AI best augment your existing processes and unlock new opportunities? Start with a pilot project, a manageable experiment that allows you to test the waters and refine your approach. Establish clear metrics to measure success, defining the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will demonstrate AI's impact.
The decision to buy a pre-built Generative AI solution or build your own depends on factors like your company's technical expertise, budget, and specific needs. Whichever path you choose, careful consideration of technical and operational aspects is paramount. Ensure your infrastructure can handle the demands of AI and build a team with the necessary skills to manage and integrate the technology seamlessly. By following these steps, CEOs can equip themselves with the essential tools to navigate the Generative AI era and unlock a future of transformative growth.
Steering a Responsible Course
The Generative AI revolution must be guided by a strong ethical compass. Bias, a persistent challenge in AI, can creep into Generative models if trained on skewed datasets. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes, undermining trust and brand reputation. To combat bias, CEOs must prioritize diverse and high-quality data for training. Partnering with data science experts to audit datasets for hidden biases is crucial. Another hurdle is the ""black box"" nature of some Generative AI models. Understanding how these models arrive at their outputs is often opaque. This lack of explainability can raise concerns about accountability and limit user trust.
To address this, CEOs should prioritize models with explainability features, allowing human oversight and fostering trust in AI-generated outcomes. Finally, data privacy is paramount. Generative AI often requires access to vast amounts of data, raising privacy concerns. CEOs must ensure robust data governance practices are in place. This includes implementing strong data security measures, anonymizing data whenever possible, and adhering to all relevant data privacy regulations. By prioritizing these ethical considerations, CEOs can ensure their Generative AI initiatives are not only powerful but also responsible and trustworthy.
Seizing the Generative AI advantage
Generative AI presents a transformative opportunity for CEOs, brimming with the potential to revolutionize industries and propel businesses forward. By embracing a human-AI collaborative mindset, CEOs can forge a future where human ingenuity is not replaced but amplified by the power of generative creation. The Generative AI CEO toolkit outlined here – from fostering a strategic mindset shift to navigating ethical considerations – equips leaders to confidently guide their organizations on this exciting journey.
However, the time for deliberation is over. The future is unfolding rapidly, and competitors who seize the reins of Generative AI will not only thrive in the coming era, but they will also define it. CEOs who hesitate risk being left behind, watching as their industries are reshaped by those who embrace this transformative technology. The call to action is clear: take the first step today, equip yourself with the knowledge, and step into a future of limitless possibilities fuelled by Generative AI.

Chatbots are dead: How generative AI & automation is transforming the way we interact with technology,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/chatbots-are-dead-how-generative-ai-automation-is-transforming-the-way-we-interact-with-technology/articleshow/109153190.cms,09-04-2024,"Remember those early days of chatbots? Clunky, repetitive conversations that left you feeling more like you were interacting with a broken record than a helpful assistant. Well, those days are behind us. The limitations of these basic
chatbots
are becoming a thing of the past as a new generation of
AI
agents powered by generative AI and automation take center stage.
Generative AI represents a significant leap forward. Imagine an AI that can not only understand your questions but also respond in a way that's natural, engaging, and even creative. This, coupled with the power of automation, promises to revolutionize the way we interact with technology in profound ways. But there's more to it than just answering questions.
The future of AI interaction lies in the ability of these agents to serve not merely as conversational partners but as comprehensive guides and copilots. They're evolving to become
digital
helpers that can navigate users through complex processes, automate tedious tasks, and offer hands-on guidance in real-time. This means that AI agents are not only getting better at understanding us but also at taking actions on our behalf, making our interactions with digital platforms smoother and more intuitive.
But before we explore the world of AI agents and how they're poised to transform everything from customer service to the way we access information, let’s take a moment to understand why those earlier chatbots are being left behind.
Navigating the complex labyrinth of customer service portals can often feel like being lost in a maze, especially when your only guide is a traditional chatbot. These bots, with their pre-programmed responses and inability to understand the nuances of human inquiry, have long been a source of frustration. They seem to assume that every user arrives with a clear understanding of their problem and the exact service they require. Yet, the reality couldn't be further from this assumption. More often than not, customers find themselves unsure of the specific service or solution they need, longing instead for a conversation that mirrors the fluidity and understanding of a human interaction.
Live Events
This craving for a more natural dialogue reflects a broader expectation among users today. Whether they're navigating banking, insurance,
healthcare
, or government applications, the desire is for AI to not just respond, but to understand, guide, and assist in a context that feels personal and relevant to their situation. Traditional chatbots, with their narrow focus on predefined queries, fall short of meeting these expectations, leaving users feeling unheard and underserved.
AI agents are designed to bridge the gap between the static, one-dimensional chatbots of yesteryear and the dynamic, intuitive digital assistants’ users dream of. Unlike their predecessors, AI agents engage with users in a natural language, providing contextual information and guiding them through processes step-by-step. Imagine an AI coach, available 24/7, capable of walking a user through resolving an issue on their insurance app or explaining how to utilize a new service on their banking portal, all in a conversation that feels as natural as talking to a friend.
Such AI agents represent a significant leap forward in digital customer service, transforming the landscape of self-service platforms. They don't just respond to queries; they anticipate needs, offer solutions, and guide users through to resolution, embodying the proactive and knowledgeable assistant that was previously missing. This shift not only enhances the user experience but also alleviates the workload on customer support staff, creating a more efficient and satisfying interaction for everyone involved.
In this landscape of innovation, tools like Microsoft Copilot for employees, Adobe Copilot for marketers, and Supervity AI coach exemplify the diverse applications of AI agents. Each acts as a digital copilot, demonstrating the adaptability and impact of this technology across various sectors. From streamlining workplace tasks to optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer support, these AI agents are pivotal in redefining what digital assistance can achieve, setting new standards for user interaction and satisfaction.
The generative AI era
Generative AI is a game-changer. This branch of AI is capable of handling enormous volumes of data to produce prose that is human-like, translate languages, and even produce various forms of artistic material. AI agents are now able to have more natural, engaging, and educational exchanges thanks to their increased fluency.
Transforming customer interaction
Imagine a customer support representative who is able to relate to your irritation, provide thorough answers to your inquiries, and even make recommendations for solutions you hadn't thought of. This represents AI agents' potential. Over time, they will learn and adapt to answer common questions, troubleshoot issues, and personalise encounters. Here are a few examples to understand the customer interaction transformation.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):
They allow human agents to handle more difficult situations by providing instantaneous answers to frequently asked questions.
Troubleshooting: AI agents can identify and fix a variety of issues using sophisticated algorithms, frequently, more quickly than a human could.
Personalised interactions:
AI agents are able to customise their responses to meet your unique demands by examining your previous interactions and preferences.
Constant Learning: AI agents are always picking up new skills and changing as a result of interactions with humans. This indicates that as time goes on, they get more adept at recognising your needs and offering beneficial answers.
Digital adoption copilot
: AI agents now serve as digital adoption copilots, changing the way users interact with digital platforms by guiding users through the intricacies of digital portals and applications, all while answering questions in the user's native language. This approach is a significant step up from the static chatbots of the past, which relied on users to initiate interactions with specific queries. Instead of waiting passively, these AI agents proactively offer assistance, ensuring users can navigate digital environments with ease and efficiency.
Automation on autopilot
Automation combined with generative AI opens up new possibilities for efficiency. AI agents have the ability to automate routine jobs, freeing up human customer support agents to handle more complicated problems. This not only shortens wait times but also enables companies to save costs.
The path ahead
Although AI agents present fascinating opportunities, difficulties still exist. Crucial components of development include protecting data security, avoiding bias in AI systems, and building confidence in these virtual assistants.
The future is now
The days of chatbots, as we know, are coming to an end. A new era of intelligent and interactive technology is being ushered in by AI agents, which are driven by automation and generative AI. The way we communicate with companies, obtain information, and move around the digital world will undoubtedly change as this technology develops.

How India's rising gaming ecosystem is bringing investment opportunities,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/how-indias-rising-gaming-ecosystem-is-bringing-investment-opportunities/articleshow/108890619.cms,30-03-2024,"The global gaming industry is currently at an inflexion point, having evolved to a worth of $184 billion through decades of technological advancements, distribution enhancements, and innovative business models. With the advent of cutting-edge technologies such as Gen AI, cloud gaming, 5G, and XR, the industry is growing rapidly.
In tandem with this global trend, India's gaming ecosystem is also witnessing remarkable growth. In 2023, it reached 500 million active gamers, with 200 million ready to invest in enhancing their experiences. This equates to over 50% of smartphone users playing games, a substantial portion of whom are willing to make in-game purchases.
However, despite its success, the gaming sector still needs to exhibit more within the ecosystem in terms of domestic studios, AI infrastructure, and gamification tools. These gaps present untapped opportunities for new-age companies. Following a comprehensive analysis of gaming trends worldwide,
Eximius Ventures
has identified specific areas with potential for emerging companies from India to capitalise on.
Domestic Studios
The Indian gaming landscape is witnessing significant growth, yet the content available often feels disconnected from the local sociocultural context. However, the boom in Indian gamers has attracted foreign developers to establish studios in the country, paving the way for veterans from these studios to potentially create gaming experiences that resonate more with Indian audiences.
Currently, out of the top 10 highest revenue-generating games in India, only one,
Teen Patti
, is developed by an Indian studio, signalling the potential for local studios to adopt global best practices and succeed in the Indian market. Additionally, there's a noticeable shift in Indian gamer preferences, with casual and hyper-casual games dominating the market, while mid-core and hardcore games are gaining traction, boasting higher ARPPUs.
Live Events
As India continues to export its culture and content across various mediums, gaming emerges as the next frontier. With globally acclaimed Indian titles like Raji - An Ancient Epic, Asura, and
Rainswept
setting precedents, Indian studios are poised for further success on the global stage. Moreover, the buoyant period in Indian cinema, with movies like Dangal, Secret Superstar, and Baahubali 2 enjoying widespread acceptance, opens doors for developers to not only cater to the Indian market but also expand their reach internationally.
Publisher Ecosystem
As the developer ecosystem in India strengthens, there is also a growing need for a greater presence of domestic publishers, similar to ecosystems in the USA and China, where domestic publishers dominate customer spending. Despite India's substantial developer community, Indian publishers command only 6% of the local mobile market, indicating the necessity for stronger domestic publishing.
The global publisher market has witnessed significant outcomes, with players like Voodoo (France), Say Games (Cyprus), and Lion Studios (USA), with Rollic (Istanbul) building a thriving outcome. Additionally, while the majority of the market is focused on casual and hyper-casual games, there are opportunities for mid-core and hardcore games, particularly for Indian publishers with specialised knowledge.
Notable Indian examples such as Glance and Jio Games have shown impressive growth, albeit with a focus on generic platforms. This suggests the potential for specialisation within specific sectors, signalling opportunities for further growth and diversification in the Indian gaming industry.
Infrastructure
The rapid technology growth in game development has exacerbated the resource demands, widening the gap between large studios and smaller developers. Despite this gap, the advent of generative AI promises to be a better playing field.
Indie studios, operating with limited resources, demonstrate agility in game development. Nearly half complete prototyping within a month, and 62% finalise development within a year. To sustain this, they leverage technology, especially AI, to streamline development and enhance user-generated content (UGC) and live operations.
UGC emerged as a key gaming trend, driving major developers to integrate engaging mechanics for viral growth. The fusion of UGC and AI is expected to produce tools that expedite development, simplify UGC creation, and streamline game lifecycle management, offering significant innovation opportunities in areas like world creation, AI behaviour mapping, live operations, creator tools, and AI-driven user acquisition.
Gamification
Gamification integrates traditional game design elements into non-gaming platforms to enhance user experience, significantly improving user retention and engagement.
The global gamification market is growing rapidly, with a 27.4% CAGR expected from 2020 to 2025. Currently, 70% of Global 2000 businesses have adopted gamification. In retail, it has led to a 700% increase in customer acquisitions and can boost user engagement by 48% and customer retention by 22%. Additionally, implementing gamification in sales processes results in a 25.3% increase in sales conversion.
As consumer-facing brands like Amazon, Flipkart, and Starbucks utilise gamification to enhance their operations, there's a growing trend among new-age companies across Fintech, Commerce, and Health to develop similar solutions. This presents an opportunity for companies to assist in creating these platforms and capitalise on the expanding gamification market.
In conclusion, emerging trends like publisher ecosystem, infrastructure development, and gamification offer fertile ground for investment in the gaming industry. With India's burgeoning gaming market and global trends gaining momentum, investments in these areas can pave the way for sustained growth and enduring success in the dynamic realm of online media & gaming.

"May look at ‘Make in India,’ Fujifilm’s Koji Wada",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/may-look-at-make-in-india-fujifilms-koji-wada/articleshow/108678137.cms,21-03-2024,"As companies look to diversify their supply chains and benefit from policies like Make in India,
Fujifilm
India on Thursday said they are thinking of
manufacturing
in the country in the medium term.
“We are always discussing Make in India. Not only the Indian government, but even the Japanese government is very supportive of this. This is also my dream and maybe in the next 2-3 years we can think of something,”
Koji Wada
, Managing Director, Fujifilm India told ET Digital.
Beyond
cameras
, medical and business devices, globally Fujifilm has a variety of products used in semiconductor manufacturing processes that are used to improve performance for
semiconductors
that support advances in digital devices, such as photoresists used in the processes to fabricate circuit patterns (wiring and components). Wada said the company may also look at semiconductors.
Under the Government’s push to manufacture semiconductors in India, ground breaking ceremonies for three semiconductor projects were conducted earlier this month. This includes the Tata Group's $11 billion semiconductor fab facility in Dholera in Gujarat, the Rs 27,000 crore chip assembly, testing, marking and packaging facility at Morigaon in Assam and Murugappa Group's CG Power's Rs 7,600 crore chip assembly facility at Sanand in Gujarat.
The company on Thursday launched a new camera in the Instax range, Mini 99. The instant camera has been priced at Rs 20,999 and will be available to buy from April 4. The company has also launched new print films called Photo Slide.
Live Events
""Since the last two years, Instax has been gaining a lot of popularity in India. We have grown almost 1.5X last year, and we have a few more days this fiscal year but our growth will be more this year. It is one of the highest growing categories and in the coming years it will grow further. We are trying to invest more in marketing and come up with a celebrity campaign next year,” said Wada. The company, which has a presence in about 2000 retail outlets in the country, is looking to expand it to about 3500 outlets next year.
According to Arun Babu, Associate Director & Head of Digital Camera, Instax & Optical Devices Business, Fujifilm India, the Instax range targets the Gen Zand the millennials. “These are the individuals who have used a lot of gadgets but still want the feeling of having a tangible result of images. With Instax you can click an image, take a printout, and decorate your wall,” Babu says.
Beyond the B2C business of cameras, Wada says the healthcare and
business solutions
products are also doing well. “These businesses are growing as the Indian economy grows. Within healthcare, growth comes from MRI and CT machines, and Endoscopy since there are new products,” says Wada."

Economic Times (ET): Where does the world stand on AI adoption, especially the developing economies?
Soumitra Dutta (SD):
I think all economies now in the world are realising that they have to adopt AI. First of all, AI is not a separate thing from technology. What is happening is, general digital technology is evolving into AI. So, for me, the distinction between digital and AI is getting blurred more and more. All economies are realising they have to actually adopt technology. The challenge, of course, is that they do not always have the skills.
Skills are the most important thing; and second, the resources. The adoption of AI technologies in emerging economies is going slower than expected and that is a problem because AI technology is moving exponentially fast right now. So the ability of emerging economies to keep up is getting challenged. That is the problem.

SD:
It’s a very important question. What is for sure is that some jobs are going to be automated by AI, some jobs are going to be enhanced by AI, and some jobs will be created by AI. What no one knows is the proportion of all.
ET: How can we be so certain that AI wouldn’t create bigger economic gaps between the developed and developing world?
SD:
See, if you look at technology, it has actually increased global inequality. That is the reality, unfortunately. I have done research in the Network Readiness Index for the last 20 years and what we have seen from the data is that the digital divide actually has increased … let us take the mobile phone as a good example. Today, everyone has a mobile phone. But the people who have more education, more money, and better network are able to make more money and more value out of the mobile phone than someone who is less educated, has less money and has got a smaller set of networks.
Soumitra Dutta, Dean of Oxford University's Said Business School
So, some people are making much more value and some people are making smaller value with the same technology. That is the key difference why the divide is growing and that is one reason why you see that the countries that do better are the ones that use technology better. The people who will do better are the ones who will be able to use technology better. So technology is not the great equaliser. It creates more inequality. Now, obviously, what happens is it creates challenges for society and governments to reduce that because you have to reduce that gap. The gap is increasing.
ET: Considering this, isn’t India, a developing economy, in a peculiar situation because it is adopting technology fast and its economy is also doing well?
SD:
Yes. So, India is on a third path of digitalisation. It is not the Chinese path, not the American path; it is its own path, which is very interesting. And the question now is that it has to integrate AI into the third path. Because right now, the third path does not really have AI integrated into it. Traditionally, it is for identity verification, it is for some kind of financial transaction that is now getting tested for some other domains like commerce and all that, but not yet fully. So, I think what India has to do is leverage on this third path and really build out the AI infrastructure in the country because India cannot rely on these western multinationals to build out the AI infrastructure.
That has to come from the India Stack architecture, because the reality is India does not have any AI company.
ET: What kind of skill sets are now required with respect to a developing country like India?
SD:
One is the invention of AI, you create the technology. Second is adoption of technology, and third is regulation. India is weak in invention. So what it needs to do is invest more in R&D because India does not do much R&D invest in academic research. It needs to get these Indian companies collaborating more with the academic institutions, with IITs.
ET: In developing nations such as India, a large chunk of jobs are generated by the agriculture sector and the MSMEs. Do you fear AI taking up many jobs in these sectors and creating some kind of imbalance for the economy?
SD:
AI is already creating a huge imbalance in society. The agricultural sector has already got mechanised a lot.
ET: In the western world?
SD:
Yes, in the western world. India has not got mechanised because the land size is small. It is not amenable to large-scale farming. Mechanisation is a reason why employment in developed economies has dropped in agriculture. Because you have automated everything with machines. That has happened in manufacturing right now.
If you look at the western world, agriculture is automated, manufacturing is automated and service is not, that is the reason why 80% of employment is in services. That is the threat. Why people are scared of AI is because they say that 80% of my population is in services and if that gets automated, like what has happened in agriculture and in manufacturing, that is a real problem for the society. For India, agriculture mechanisation will probably never be that high.
ET: How does AI impact a country’s GDP?
SD:
You look at Germany's GDP, it is driven by the middle and small companies. The one reason why Germany's middle-sized companies are doing very good is because they invest heavily in technology automation. I think in general what you see is the more automation you have, the more value you create."
Bitcoin's price could have a positive ripple effect on the broader crypto ecosystem: NFTFN,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/bitcoins-price-could-have-a-positive-ripple-effect-on-the-broader-crypto-ecosystem-nftfn/articleshow/108430168.cms,12-03-2024,"With
Bitcoin
reaching record levels $72, 000 on March 11, the
cryptocurrency
is poised to touch new peaks. According to
crypto market
research platform Crebaco, Bitcoin is well on track to reach USD100,000-USD150,000 by the end of 2024. As exuberance grows, Abhishek Kumar Gupta, Co-Founder of
NFTFN
talks about what could drive a bigger rally in Bitcoin and what it means for the broader cryptocurrency market. Edited excerpts:
Economic Times (ET):
Bitcoin levels are touching new peak and we now hear about Bitcoin Halving that is expected to drive up value even more. What is Bitcoin halving and why does it matter?
Abhishek Kumar Gupta (AKG):
Bitcoin Halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years, where the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is halved.
This event is built into the Bitcoin protocol to control the supply of Bitcoin and maintain its scarcity over time. The upcoming 2024 Bitcoin Halving, scheduled for April 2024, will see the
mining reward
reduced from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins per block.
This reduction in the rate of new Bitcoin creation is expected to have a key impact on Bitcoin's supply-demand dynamics. Historically, each halving event has been followed by a price surge, as the reduced rate of new supply entering the market creates scarcity, increasing demand for Bitcoin.
Live Events
This scarcity effect is similar to that observed in precious metals like gold, which are valued for their scarcity and store-of-value properties.
ET:
With the possibility of a US recession aligning with Bitcoin's fourth halving in April 2024, and significant interest in Bitcoin ETFs, how do you foresee these developments affecting the global cryptocurrency market's dynamics and investor behavior?
AKG:
It's a complex scenario. While a potential US recession and the Bitcoin halving might create uncertainties, other factors like increasing adoption and the emergence of regulated Bitcoin ETFs could offer support.
We may see increased volatility in the short term, but historically, Bitcoin halvings have been followed by price appreciation. Investor behavior will likely be cautious, with a focus on established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
This could lead to a flight to quality, potentially benefiting established projects with strong fundamentals. However, it's crucial to remember that past performance isn't a guarantee of future results.
ET:
Given the projected growth of the NFT market to $231 billion by 2030 and its expansion into gaming, fashion, and potentially real estate, how do you see the role of NFTs evolving in both digital and physical asset markets?
AKG:
The NFT market's projected growth is exciting. We're already seeing NFTs integrated into various sectors like gaming and fashion, with real estate potentially following suit. NFTs have the potential to revolutionize how we own and interact with both digital and physical assets.
In the digital realm, NFTs can represent unique in-game items, wearables in the metaverse, or even music rights. In the physical world, fractional ownership of real estate through NFTs could become a reality, improving accessibility and liquidity. Overall, NFTs are poised to play a transformative role in the future of asset ownership across diverse sectors.
ET:
In the aftermath of the FTX collapse and increased regulatory scrutiny, what are your predictions for how regulation will shape the future of cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet security, and investor protection?
AKG:
The FTX collapse and increased regulatory scrutiny highlight the need for clearer regulations in the crypto space.
While robust regulations are crucial for fostering trust and protecting investors, excessive restrictions could stifle innovation. I believe we'll see a balanced approach with regulations focusing on consumer protection, exchange transparency, and AML/KYC compliance.
This will likely lead to a more mature and sustainable crypto ecosystem with established exchanges implementing stricter security measures and prioritizing investor safeguards.
ET:
Bitcoin halving has historically influenced Bitcoin's price and mining economics. What impact do you anticipate this will have on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, including altcoins and the NFT sector?
AKG:
The upcoming Bitcoin halving will undoubtedly impact the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. As Bitcoin's supply gets cut in half, its mining difficulty and production rate will decrease, potentially leading to a price increase based on historical trends.
This price appreciation could have a positive ripple effect on the broader crypto market, boosting investor confidence and potentially leading to increased interest in altcoins. However, it's important to note that this is a complex ecosystem with various factors influencing individual altcoin performance.
While the specific impact of the Bitcoin halving on the NFT market remains to be seen, a potential rise in Bitcoin's price could have a positive ripple effect on the broader crypto ecosystem, potentially boosting investor confidence and fueling further exploration and innovation within the NFT space. This increased interest and activity could ultimately contribute to the continued growth and maturation of the NFT market.
ET:
With the integration of blockchain and AI identified as a significant trend, how do you believe these technologies will transform the user experience and operational efficiencies within the cryptocurrency and NFT markets?
AKG:
The convergence of blockchain and AI presents exciting possibilities for the cryptocurrency and NFT markets.
AI can be used to enhance security through anomaly detection and fraud prevention, while also improving user experience through personalized investment recommendations and streamlined trading experiences. Blockchain technology can provide a secure and transparent foundation for AI applications, fostering trust and reliability.
These combined innovations have the potential to make the crypto and NFT markets more accessible, secure, and efficient for a wider audience.
ET:
As co-founder of NFTFN, how are you positioning the platform to leverage the expected rebound and growth of the NFT market, particularly in high-growth sectors like gaming and fashion?
AKG:
Innovation is at the core of NFTFN. We're constantly exploring new ways to enhance the user experience and address the evolving needs of the NFT market.
Here are some potential areas of exploration:
●
Developing new NFT indices:
We are exploring the creation of thematic NFT indices focused on specific sectors like gaming or metaverse projects that are based on Blue-Chip NFTs

Unlocking growth: Can Budget provide the path to a thriving crypto ecosystem in India?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/unlocking-growth-can-budget-provide-the-path-to-a-thriving-crypto-ecosystem-in-india/articleshow/107252660.cms,30-01-2024,"As India prepares for the Union
Budget 2024
, it is an opportune moment to reflect on the global
cryptocurrency
landscape and envision a more crypto-friendly future. The past year brought challenges, but recent developments like the US SEC's approval of a spot
Bitcoin
ETF signal a turning point, highlighting the immense potential within the world of digital currencies.
Global context and comparative insights
Looking to nations like El Salvador and Switzerland, which have successfully integrated crypto into their financial systems, offers valuable lessons. Singapore’s clear regulatory framework fosters a secure environment for crypto businesses, while Switzerland’s progressive policies have made it a hub for crypto
innovation
. These examples demonstrate that balanced regulation can lead to a thriving crypto economy, a model India could emulate to achieve similar success.
Technological innovations: beyond transactions
Blockchain technology extends far beyond cryptocurrencies, encompassing smart contracts that automate and secure agreements,
decentralised finance
(DeFi) platforms that provide alternative financial services, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that revolutionise digital ownership. These innovations can transform various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and digital art. India’s proactive involvement in these technologies can spur economic growth and technological advancement.
Navigating risks and challenges
Live Events
The volatility, security concerns, and potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities are major risks. India’s regulatory framework should mitigate these risks through comprehensive strategies like robust security protocols, anti-money laundering measures, and strong investor protections. Tackling these challenges head-on can create a secure environment for crypto investments, instilling confidence in investors and the market.
Consumer protection and education: A dual approach
Protecting consumers in the crypto market requires not only regulatory measures but also educational initiatives. Informing the public about the intricacies of crypto investing, secure practices, and fraud prevention can lead to more informed decision-making. Educating investors is key to a healthy crypto ecosystem, reducing vulnerability to market volatility and scams.
Inclusive stakeholder engagement
Effective crypto policy development requires input from diverse stakeholders, including government bodies, financial experts, crypto entrepreneurs, academia, and consumers. This inclusive approach ensures comprehensive, realistic, and beneficial policies. Collaborative policymaking fosters innovation and leads to more effective solutions.
Vision for long-term impact
India’s long-term strategy for crypto should focus on innovation, job creation, and financial inclusion. Embracing crypto can position India as a leader in digital finance and technology, attracting international businesses and fostering local innovation. This proactive regulatory approach can unlock significant opportunities for economic growth.
Actionable policy recommendations
India needs concrete policy actions to realise this vision. Rationalising the tax structure for cryptocurrencies, allowing loss set-offs, and integrating cryptocurrencies into the banking system are immediate steps. Additionally, pilot programs to test regulatory approaches, tax incentives for local crypto businesses, and a dedicated regulatory body for the crypto sector are worth exploring.
To sum up, as India anticipates the Union Budget 2024, there is hope for policies that unlock the potential of cryptocurrencies, propelling the nation into a new era of financial innovation and growth.

Why generative AI is significant for businesses to gain a competitive edge,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/why-generative-ai-is-significant-for-businesses-to-gain-a-competitive-edge/articleshow/105611522.cms,30-11-2023,"The pace at which companies are rolling out
generative AI
lags behind consumer demand and employee usage, a new
survey
from
Adobe
suggests.
Only 47% of respondents in
India
said the company they work for currently uses generative AI tools. A remarkable 94% of Indian employees said they had already used generative AI in marketing and customer experience campaigns in the workplace; 52% have employed large language models and 50% have used text-to-image generators to create promotional brand materials and content.
Generative AI essentially refers to deep-learning models that generate high-quality text, images as well as other content based on the data they get trained on.
The research is derived from an online survey of more than 16,113 consumers and 4,250 marketing and customer experience professionals globally. The survey was conducted by Advanis in May 2023. The Asia-Pacific analysis comprises a sample of 5,027 consumer respondents and 1,877 marketing and customer experience professionals. This includes Australia and New Zealand as well.
Anindita Veluri, Director of Marketing, Adobe India, said generative AI represents a significant shift, not only in business innovation but also in fundamentally transforming how we approach and execute marketing. “It has the potential to drive efficient productivity and reshape marketing across various applications, including customer engagement, personalised content creation at scale, more robust data insights, lead generation, and increased speed to market. The capability of marketers to rapidly create, modify, and enhance content for greater impact through generative AI is a unique opportunity that brands need to leverage now,” she stated.
Live Events
Leveraging generative AI in the current digital landscape is paramount for firms to decode and meet evolving consumer expectations. “This technology, with its advanced algorithms, enables
businesses
to process vast amounts of data for insights, driving customised and predictive consumer engagements,” she added.
Affirming such views, Manav Sethi, Head Media Martech & Growth, Hero MotoCorp, said generative AI is the raw material businesses need to elevate not only the customer side of experiences, but also help bring efficiencies and time-to-market advantages to platform building. “Bearing the tremendous future ahead of it, one can make gen AI part of the entire customer journey and personalised experience, potentially impacting MarTech, content, creativity, and personalisation at scale,” he said.
Findability Sciences, an enterprise AI company, has integrated generative AI for predictive and prescriptive analytics services across various industries, including manufacturing, financial services, retail and telecom. In manufacturing, for example, they focused on forecasting equipment failures and optimising supply chains, while in financial services, they predicted market trends and risk assessments.
Anand Mahurkar, Founder & CEO, Findability Sciences, said firms can achieve a significant edge in personalisation and efficiency by the use of such AI. “It translates to enhanced customer experiences and operational excellence. The strategic use of generative AI is not just an innovation but a necessity for businesses aiming to lead in market responsiveness and agility,” he added."
"Important to regulate AI, data to get large scale benefits: N Chandrasekaran at B20 India",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/important-to-regulate-ai-data-to-get-large-scale-benefits-n-chandrashekaran-at-b20-india/articleshow/103080010.cms,26-08-2023,"The world today is being run by
artificial intelligence
(AI). In a country like India, with such a vast population, and the majority of it being youngsters, it can have a massive impact. However, it’s important to allow this technology to integrate with regulations so that we can have the ability to build private applications on top of public infrastructure, said
N Chandrasekaran
, Chair,
B20 India
, and Executive Chairman,
Tata Sons
, India.
He was answering a question about his thoughts on the new Digital Personal
Data
Protection Act. He explained that to realise the power of AI, the right infrastructure was needed, which essentially meant that cloud data centres and access to digital devices for everyone in the country was going to be fundamental.
“Once that infrastructure is there, what we will do is enable the empowerment of businesses and society at large to be able to make that impact what we are talking about,” he said while speaking at the B20 India event here on Friday.
He added that in a country like India, about 250 to 300 million people have access to information, and access to goods and services which just multiplies the whole GDP to a different level. “On the other hand, we talk about ageing economies. The ageing economies are also going to face longevity because of medical sciences, and all these people have to be taken care of and they don't have enough human resources to provide the kind of service that is needed,” he said.
AI will come in handy here and play an important role because the vast majority of the things that have to be taken care of can be done by AI. “So the benefits are going to be different to different segments and in different markets. But everywhere it is going to create joy, it is going to create jobs, it is going to empower people to do a lot of jobs in markets where there are no people, it's going to substitute for human beings and provide the service that is expected,” he said.

This innovation should be allowed and in order to allow this integration, proper regulations are required and there should be the ability to build private applications on top of the public infrastructure. “That is what has happened in India. The legal framework has come up with this data privacy and data protection act, which provides the legal requirement,” he said.
He explained that this technology architecture provides data empowerment and protection architecture. It creates the necessary public infrastructure architecture to build private applications and digital consent gets embedded.
“So any sharing can be done at the aggregate level with proper consent. So it is a fantastic breakthrough I feel because it is very different from the traditional approach of wallet engineering, the laws and regulatory framework, which is totally punitive,” he said.
Usually in such punitive laws, there are fines for damages. “But in a country like India, you cannot put such large damages because there's no way that people will pay. So the better way is to integrate a technology architecture with a legal framework. And that's what it is. It is something to be studied and championed,” he added."
How MSMEs are missing out by not using business analytics,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/how-msmes-are-missing-out-by-not-using-business-analytics/articleshow/101589254.cms,08-07-2023,"Having information, especially when taking risk, is critical. Growth comes with risk. So, calculations pave better paths for growth. Yet, though information is readily available, the majority of
MSMEs
are lagging behind in taking advantage of analytics. The time has now come for MSMEs to up their game by undergoing a paradigm shift and adopting analytics.
In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, data has become a valuable asset that holds the key to unlocking insights and driving informed decision-making. Large corporations have been quick to embrace the power of
business analytics
while, unfortunately, many Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have yet to tap into its full potential. Here, we explore why & how, in today's competitive market, MSMEs are missing out by not utilizing business analytics and emphasize why it is important to integrate data-driven strategies.
Apart from a lack of awareness and limited resources, there are several reasons:
Data Accessibility and Quality:
Lack of proper data collection and management systems, making it difficult to gather accurate and comprehensive data for analysis. For example, the amount of data available with MSMEs in their accounting softwares and
ERP
is never analyzed for the growth.
Skills and Expertise Gap:
Lack of the internal expertise or resources to effectively utilize business analytics.

Time Constraints:
Limited time to focus on non-operational activities, such as data analysis. It is also a perspective issue. MSMEs do not understand that data analysis has become an integral part of running the business.
Resistance to Change:
Comfortable with traditional decision-making approaches that rely on experience and intuition, rather than data-driven insights.
Perceived Complexity:
Perceiving business analytics as complex and intimidating, they may lack confidence in their ability to understand and utilize analytics tools effectively.
Lack of Clear Objectives:
MSMEs may struggle to define clear objectives for utilizing business analytics. Without a clear understanding of how data analysis can drive value and support their specific business goals, they may not prioritize investment in it.
How MSMEs are missing out
Informed Decision-Making:
By relying solely on intuition and gut feelings when making critical business decisions, MSMEs are missing out on the factual insights derived from data analysis. By leveraging the power of data, MSMEs can gain a deeper understanding of their market, customer behavior, and industry trends, and make informed decisions. This, in turn, minimizes risks and maximizes opportunities.
Competitive Advantage
:
By failing to harness the power of business analytics, MSMEs risk falling behind their competitors. On the other hand, by analyzing market trends, customer preferences, and competitor activities, MSMEs can identify gaps, anticipate shifts in demand, and adapt their strategies accordingly. Leveraging data-driven insights allows MSMEs to differentiate themselves, develop tailored offerings, and gain a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
Operational Efficiency:
MSMEs are missing out on possible growth and profitability. Business analytics provides valuable insights into production processes, supply chain management, and resource allocation. Further, MSMEs can identify bottlenecks, streamline workflows, reduce costs, and enhance overall productivity. In turn, these improvements create a lean and agile organizational structure that is better equipped to respond to market demands.
Enhanced Customer Experience:
Delivering a superior customer experience is vital for MSMEs to foster loyalty and drive repeat business. Business analytics empowers companies to gain a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences, behaviors, and needs. With this knowledge, MSMEs can personalize marketing campaigns, tailor products or services, and provide targeted and relevant customer experiences. In turn, this allows MSMEs to create personalized interactions that build strong and lasting relationships with their customers.
Effective Marketing Strategies
:
MSMEs can significantly benefit from leveraging data-driven marketing strategies. Business analytics helps MSMEs identify and understand their target audience, optimize marketing campaigns, and measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts. By analyzing customer data, MSMEs can identify the most impactful channels, messages, and offers to engage their audience, resulting in higher conversion rates, improved ROI, and stronger brand positioning.
Risk Management:
MSMEs are missing out on identifying potential risks, such as fraud, security breaches, or market fluctuations and are unaware of the current impact on their operations and financial stability. By analyzing data patterns, MSMEs can detect anomalies, implement early warning systems, and proactively mitigate risks. By leveraging analytics, MSMEs can safeguard their businesses while protecting their reputation and financial well-being.
In an era where data reigns supreme, MSMEs must recognize that they are missing out on untapped potential and tremendous opportunities. By embracing data-driven decision-making, MSMEs gain “superpowers” to stay ahead of the curve, gain a competitive advantage, and thrive in the ever-evolving business landscape. Now is the time, MSMEs should unleash the power of data and harness the numerous benefits that business analytics offers to propel their growth, enhance operational efficiency, deliver exceptional customer experiences, and secure a prosperous future.

This growth is driven by factors such as increasing labour costs, the need for precision and quality, and the growing adoption of automation in various industries. Cobot's expansion in India is a step in collaborative automation solutions that will help revolutionize the manufacturing landscape.
Cobots for warehouse automation
Cobots offer several advantages when it comes to warehouse automation. They are compact and flexible, making them suitable for operations in confined spaces. Unlike their larger counterparts, cobots can easily be integrated into existing warehouse layouts without requiring significant modifications. Their lightweight design also enables easy reconfiguration and redeployment for various tasks, making them highly adaptable to changing operational needs.
Cobots are also designed with built-in safety features that allow them to operate close to humans. This cuts the need for costly safety barriers and reduces the risk of workplace accidents. Cobots use advanced sensors and vision systems to detect human presence, automatically slowing down or halting their movements to ensure safe collaboration.
Cobots to reduce operational costs
One of the most compelling reasons for adopting cobots is their potential to reduce operational costs in industrial settings. Traditional automation solutions often require significant capital investment, extensive retooling and dedicated infrastructure. In contrast, cobots are cost-effective and easier to deploy. They have a smaller footprint, lower energy consumption and are more affordable compared to larger robotic systems. Moreover, the collaborative nature of cobots allows them to share the workspace with humans, dropping the need for separate production lines or work areas.
Cobots also contribute to cost savings through increased productivity. By automating repetitive and physically demanding tasks, they free up human workers to focus on higher-value activities that require creativity and critical thinking skills. This not only enhances productivity but also improves job satisfaction among employees.

Future of work:  Can everyday employees create & implement automation with zero coding skills?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/future-of-work-can-everyday-employees-create-implement-automation-with-zero-coding-skills/articleshow/100929909.cms,12-06-2023,"From asking
Siri
to name the capital of Peru to getting ChatGPT to write an article on the Ukraine conflict, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has entered our lives almost insidiously – we may not even know in how many ways
AI
impacts our daily actions.
It has become an increasingly common presence in the modern workplace. The sophistication of today's AI means that it can now handle more intricate workflows without cumbersome human control and oversight. From predictive analytics to automated administrative tasks, AI reduces workloads and creates efficiencies that help businesses maximize their own profits.
In addition to streamlining processes that have mostly been manual in the past, AI is known to also offer deeper insight into customer data and trends that can be used to create breakthrough marketing and product strategies. It also plays an important role in cyber-security, identifying threats before they become a crisis. As technology evolves, more opportunities arise for organizations to integrate AI into their workflow. But what does it mean for knowledge workers?
Data suggests that a knowledge worker spends 25% of their time searching for information, 22% on repetitive tasks, and 70% are burdened by manual tasks, helping to explain why so many feel bogged down by their work. Interestingly, a business with 1,000 knowledge workers loses $10 million a year from poor productivity tools. While technology has brought in efficiency, it has created new inefficiencies like processing vast amounts of information from numerous sources. Incessant emails and notifications, managing multiple applications, working across different software applications has created a vortex of tasks that an everyday employee is stuck in. It has also created room for (human) errors to creep in with different applications that demand frequent cut-and-paste actions.
Modern technology offers useful tools such as
digital work assistants
and
automation
that can help streamline processes and proactively eliminate needless monotony resulting in high productivity and job satisfaction. While humans are irreplaceable when it comes to strategic decision-making and creativity, automation is a key element in improving productivity, efficiency and even morale in modern workplaces. According to data, about 60% of occupations have at least 30% of their activities that are automatable. Moreover, processing data (69%) and collecting data (64%) are the most automatable activities.
Live Events
Till now, siloed and disconnected applications and processes have kept human cognition, creativity and innovation at bay. Unleashing them can benefit organizations immensely. This means that valuable resources should be devoted to reducing the time spent searching and organizing, and instead used for more productive and innovative initiatives.
Traditional automation systems are limited in their capacity to complete tasks due to predetermined programming instructions needing manual adjustments where needed; presenting situations that require humans with problem-solving capabilities to step in for further support. It needs programming skills and heavily depends on the IT support team to enable users to use the tool. Automation itself has come a long way. Technologies like Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have changed the automation landscape considerably. Simpler integrations and workflows have enabled a larger number of business users to take advantage of its benefits. But it still comes with its own set of drawbacks. It needs
coding
which requires involvement of IT department that is already overwhelmed and busy resolving never-ending issues.
Enter Citizen Automation
. Citizen Automation enables everyday employees to create and implement automation without the need for coding or programming knowledge. It eliminates the need for IT teams to manage automation and takes care of tedious manual processes, allowing citizens to effortlessly streamline their daily tasks.
Citizen Automators are everyday professionals with a knack for process improvement, streamlining cumbersome manual labor through the utilization of automation technology. From leveraging low code platforms such as RPA to maximizing no-code tools, these business users take on the job of creating smarter processes that address challenges at their level.
Workers now have the opportunity to gain control over their job functions by leveraging automation technology and taking advantage of convergence between RPA and no-code applications. This means that individuals can be empowered to shape how automated process applications are utilized, instead of waiting for IT departments or managers as dictated in a ""top-down"" approach. Technology is being democratized so people don’t use it out of necessity — but because they desire greater efficiency gains through increased autonomy. Choosing Citizen Automation takes out the power of automation from the hands of the few and puts it in the hands of those who can benefit from it instantly.
As mentioned earlier, human cognition is unmatched. No amount of automation can replace human creativity. Knowledge workers should invest their time in creative work, focusing on improving processes, problem-solving, innovation, work that invites confidence, leads to learning and knowledge-sharing. Therefore, what is needed is a blended workforce where humans and AI work together. Working alongside automation that takes care of mundane repetitive tasks while human workers focus on high value work is the best collaboration that will shape the future of work.

How AI and DNA are unlocking the mysteries of global supply chains,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/how-ai-and-dna-are-unlocking-the-mysteries-of-global-supply-chains/articleshow/99331955.cms,08-04-2023,"At a cotton gin in the San Joaquin Valley, in California, a boxy machine helps to spray a fine mist containing billions of molecules of DNA onto freshly cleaned Pima cotton.
That DNA will act as a kind of minuscule bar code, nestling amid the puffy fibres as they are shuttled to factories in India. There, the cotton will be spun into yarn and woven into bedsheets, before landing on the shelves of Costco stores in the United States. At any time, Costco can test for the DNA’s presence to ensure that its American-grown cotton hasn’t been replaced with cheaper materials — like cotton from the Xinjiang region of China, which is banned in the United States because of its ties to forced labor.
Amid growing concern about opacity and abuses in global supply chains, companies and government officials are increasingly turning to technologies like DNA tracking,
artificial intelligence
and blockchains to try to trace raw materials from the source to the store.
Companies in the United States are now subject to new rules that require firms to prove their goods are made without forced labor, or face having them seized at the border. U.S. customs officials said in March that they had already detained nearly $1 billion worth of shipments coming into the United States that were suspected of having some ties to Xinjiang. Products from the region have been banned since June 2022.
Customers are also demanding proof that expensive, high-end products — like conflict-free diamonds, organic cotton, sushi-grade tuna or Manuka honey — are genuine, and produced in ethically and environmentally sustainable ways.

That has forced a new reality on companies that have long relied on a tangle of global factories to source their goods. More than ever before, companies must be able to explain where their products really come from.
The task may seem straightforward, but it can be surprisingly tricky. That’s because the international supply chains that companies have built in recent decades to cut costs and diversify their product offerings have grown astonishingly complex. Since 2000, the value of intermediate goods used to make products that are traded internationally has tripled, driven partly by China’s booming factories.
A large, multinational company may buy parts, materials or services from thousands of suppliers around the world. One of the largest such companies,
Procter
& Gamble, which owns brands like Tide, Crest and Pampers, has nearly 50,000 direct suppliers. Each of those suppliers may, in turn, rely on hundreds of other companies for the parts used to make its product — and so on, for many levels up the
supply chain
.
NYT News Service
A cotton sample at Applied DNA Sciences that is being tested to determine its origins, at the Long Island High Technology Incubator in Stony Brook, N.Y.
To make a pair of jeans, for example, various companies must farm and clean cotton, spin it into thread, dye it, weave it into fabric, cut the fabric into patterns and stitch the jeans together. Other webs of companies mine, smelt or process the brass, nickel or aluminium that is crafted into the zipper, or make the chemicals that are used to manufacture synthetic indigo dye.
“Supply chains are like a bowl of spaghetti,” said James McGregor, the chair of the greater China region for APCO Worldwide, an advisory firm. “They get mixed all over. You don’t know where that stuff comes from.”
Given these challenges, some companies are turning to alternative methods, not all proven, to try to inspect their supply chains.
Some companies — like the one that sprays the DNA mist onto cotton,
Applied DNA Sciences
— are using scientific processes to tag or test a physical attribute of the good itself, to figure out where it has traveled on its path from factories to consumer.
Applied DNA has used its synthetic
DNA tags
, each just a billionth of the size of a grain of sugar, to track microcircuits produced for the Department of Defense, trace cannabis supply chains to ensure the product’s purity and even to mist robbers in Sweden who attempted to steal cash from ATMs, leading to multiple arrests.
MeiLin Wan, the vice president for textiles at Applied DNA, said the new regulations were creating a “tipping point for real transparency.”
“There definitely is a lot more interest,” she added.
The cotton industry was one of the earliest adopters of tracing technologies, in part because of previous transgressions. In the mid-2010s, Target, Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond faced expensive product recalls or lawsuits after the “Egyptian cotton” sheets they sold turned out to have been made with cotton from elsewhere. A New York Times investigation last year documented that the “organic cotton” industry was also rife with fraud.
In addition to the DNA mist it applies as a marker, Applied DNA can figure out where cotton comes from by sequencing the DNA of the cotton itself, or analysing its isotopes, which are variations in the carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the cotton. Differences in rainfall, latitude, temperature and soil conditions mean these atoms vary slightly across regions of the world, allowing researchers to map where the cotton in a pair of socks or bath towel has come from.
Other companies are turning to digital technology to map supply chains, by creating and analysing complex databases of corporate ownership and trade.
Some firms, for example, are using
blockchain
technology to create a digital token for every product that a factory produces. As that product — a can of caviar, say, or a batch of coffee — moves through the supply chain, its digital twin gets encoded with information about how it has been transported and processed, providing a transparent log for companies and consumers.
Other companies are using databases or artificial intelligence to comb through vast supplier networks for distant links to banned entities, or to detect unusual trade patterns that indicate fraud — investigations that could take years to carry out without computing power.
Sayari, a corporate risk intelligence provider that has developed a platform combining data from billions of public records issued globally, is one of those companies. The service is now used by U.S. customs agents as well as private companies. On a recent Tuesday, Jessica Abell, the vice president of solutions at Sayari, ran the supplier list of a major U.S. retailer through the platform and watched as dozens of tiny red flags appeared next to the names of distant companies.
“We’re flagging not only the Chinese companies that are in Xinjiang, but then we’re also automatically exploring their commercial networks and flagging the companies that are directly connected to it,” Abell said. It is up to the companies to decide what, if anything, to do about their exposure.
Studies have found that most companies have surprisingly little visibility into the upper reaches of their supply chains, because they lack either the resources or the incentives to investigate. In a 2022 survey by McKinsey & Co., 45% of respondents said they had no visibility at all into their supply chain beyond their immediate suppliers.
But staying in the dark is no longer feasible for companies, particularly those in the United States, after the congressionally imposed ban on importing products from Xinjiang — where 100,000 ethnic minorities are presumed by the U.S. government to be working in conditions of forced labor — went into effect last year.
Xinjiang’s links to certain products are already well known. Experts have estimated that roughly 1 in 5 cotton garments sold globally contains cotton or yarn from Xinjiang. The region is also responsible for more than 40% of the world’s polysilicon, which is used in solar panels, and a quarter of its tomato paste.
But other industries, like cars, vinyl flooring and aluminIum, also appear to have connections to suppliers in the region and are coming under more scrutiny from regulators.
Having a full picture of their supply chains can offer companies other benefits, like helping them recall faulty products or reduce costs. The information is increasingly needed to estimate how much carbon dioxide is actually emitted in the production of a good, or to satisfy other government rules that require products to be sourced from particular places — such as the Biden administration’s new rules on electric vehicle tax credits.
Executives at these technology companies say they envision a future, perhaps within the next decade, in which most supply chains are fully traceable, an outgrowth of both tougher government regulations and the wider adoption of technologies.
“It’s eminently doable,” said Leonardo Bonanni, the chief executive of Sourcemap, which has helped companies like the chocolate maker Mars map out their supply chains. “If you want access to the U.S. market for your goods, it’s a small price to pay, frankly.”
Others express skepticism about the limitations of these technologies, including their cost. While Applied DNA’s technology, for example, adds only 5 to 7 cents to the price of a finished piece of apparel, that may be significant for retailers competing on thin margins.
And some express concerns about accuracy, including, for example, databases that may flag companies incorrectly. Investigators still need to be on the ground locally, they say, speaking with workers and remaining alert for signs of forced or child labor that may not show up in digital records.
Justin Dillon, chief executive of FRDM, a software company that helps organisations map their supply chains, said there was “a lot of angst, a lot of confusion” among companies trying to satisfy the government’s new requirements.
Importers are “looking for boxes to check,” he said. “And transparency in supply chains is as much an art as it is a science. It’s kind of never done.”"
"Role of AI in metaverse, from content creation to cybersecurity",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/role-of-ai-in-metaverse-from-content-creation-to-cybersecurity/articleshow/99256925.cms,05-04-2023,"Artificial Intelligence
(AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology that has already made significant contributions to various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. Recently, AI has emerged as a critical component in the development of the
Metaverse
, a virtual world where people can interact with each other, and digital entities in a fully immersive environment. In this article, we will discuss the role of AI in the Metaverse, its potential impact on society, and the challenges it faces.
What is the Metaverse?
The Metaverse is a term coined by the science fiction author Neal Stephenson in his novel Snow Crash. It refers to a collective virtual shared space that is created by the convergence of various technologies, such as
virtual reality
, augmented reality, blockchain, and the internet. In the Metaverse, users can interact with each other in real-time, create and customise their avatars, and engage in activities such as gaming, shopping, and socialising.
Role of AI in the Metaverse
AI is essential for the creation and management of the Metaverse. Here are some of the critical roles that AI plays in the Metaverse.
Content Creation
:
AI can help in the creation of content for the Metaverse, such as 3D models, textures, and animations. AI-powered tools can automate the process of creating and designing virtual environments, reducing the time and cost required for content creation.
Security:
The Metaverse poses various security challenges, such as identity theft, fraud, and cyber-attacks. AI can be used to monitor user behaviour and detect any suspicious activity, such as attempts to steal personal information or engage in malicious behaviour.
Personalisation:
AI algorithms can analyse user data to create a personalised experience for each user. For example, an AI system can learn a user's preferences for virtual clothing, virtual accessories, and virtual activities, and suggest personalised options.
Creating and managing digital entities:
In the Metaverse, AI is used to create and manage various digital entities such as non-player characters (NPCs), virtual assistants, and chatbots. These entities can interact with users and provide them with personalised experiences based on their preferences and behaviour.
Immersion:
AI can help create more immersive virtual environments by enabling realistic physics, lighting, and sound effects. For example, AI algorithms can simulate the behaviour of water, fire, and other natural elements, making the virtual environment more realistic.
Real-time translation:
AI can enable real-time translation of languages spoken in the Metaverse, making it easier for people from different countries to communicate and collaborate. This could lead to the creation of a truly global virtual community.
Intelligent NPCs:
Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are characters controlled by the game's AI, which can interact with users in the virtual environment. AI algorithms can enable NPCs to understand natural language and respond appropriately, making the interactions more realistic and engaging.
