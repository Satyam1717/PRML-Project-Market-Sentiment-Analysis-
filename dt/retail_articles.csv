Indian consumer's dash from e to q: How far can it go?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indian-consumers-dash-from-e-to-q-how-far-can-it-go/articleshow/119650065.cms,28-03-2025,"India's consumer's quick dash from e-commerce to q-commerce (less than 30-minute delivery) in the past few years marks a radical trend in Indian retail. Quick commerce has started eating into e-commerce. A recent report by consultancy firm Bain and e-commerce giant
Flipkart
says these platforms accounted for over two-thirds of all e-grocery orders and a tenth of overall e-retail dollars. While physical retail, especially kirana, has taken a direct hit from expanding q-commerce, it is e-commerce which is now facing the challenge from q-commerce platforms. To not lose their customers to new q-commerce platforms, two major e-commerce platforms, Amazon and Flipkart, have launched their own q-commerce ventures.
""Indian q-commerce players have bucked global trends and scaled profitably. India’s unique structural advantages, including high population density and close access to a network of low-rent dark stores, have enabled this growth. Q-commerce has since attracted multiple players, which has made the consumer value proposition richer,"" says the report. Q-commerce is projected to grow at over 40% annually through 2030, driven by expansion across categories, geographies, and customer segments. Q-commerce is projected to grow at over 40% annually through 2030, driven by expansion across categories, geographies, and customer segments.
Quick maturing of quick commerce
While q-commerce began with groceries, 15%–20% of its GMV now comes from categories such as general merchandise, mobile phones, electronics, and apparel. A few days ago,
Swiggy
Instamart, a leading q-commerce platform, said it will now deliver smartphones in 10 major cities. Q-commerce platforms have been continuously diversifying their offerings by partnering with brands and introducing products that were previously sold on ecommerce platforms. Rivals Zomato-owned
Blinkit
and
Zepto
are also offering electronics and phones, in addition to items such as fashion, accessories, beauty, and personal care products.
Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa recently told ET that it will start selling air-conditioners this year. BibBasket, a Tata Digital-backed firm, is planning to introduce a range of products including air conditioners, fans and coolers. It plans to list two air-conditioner brands, three cooler brands, and six fan brands for the season.
Rising competitive intensity in q-commerce has led to companies spending heavily on performance marketing, industry executives told ET last month. While Swiggy is pushing its standalone Instamart app, Zepto has been spending to market its Cafe app on online channels such as Google and Meta suites. Over the last few months, Zomato-owned Blinkit has also stepped up on customer acquisition expenses, particularly in new geographies that it is entering. While these platforms earlier spent Rs 400-450 for acquiring a customer, that has now increased to upwards of Rs 800, an executive at a digital marketing firm had told ET.

India's quick commerce sector made two-thirds of all 2024 e-grocery orders: Report
Currently, the q-commerce sector employs 2.5-3 lakh outdoor delivery partners and 70,000-75,000 under-the-roof employees, which includes dark stores and warehouses, according to data by TeamLease Services. The sector, which is witnessing rapid expansion and is expected to reach $5 billion, will provide jobs to more than 5-5.5 lakh people by the next year.
""India's q-commerce sector is expanding at an unprecedented rate, with the market size projected to reach USD 5 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 10-15 per cent. The surge in last-mile delivery, dark store operations, and warehouse management roles are mainly due to increasing categories of products, rise in number of cities and growth in volumes. Jobs under the roof and delivery partners will increase by 50 per cent each, taking the overall jobs in the Q-Commerce sector to over 5-5.5 lakh in next 1 year,"" TeamLease Services Senior VP and Business Head Balasubramanian A told PTI recently.
India's q-commerce industry was estimated to cross $6 billion in annual sales in 2024 from $100 million in 2020, according to Datum Intelligence.
How far can the race from e-commerce to quick-commerce go?
Q-commerce players have improved unit economics by increasing order values, lowering supply chain costs, and enhancing gross margins (via direct sourcing from producers and farmers, and deploying monetization levers such as advertising and platform fees), as per the Bain report. However, to sustain profitable growth, companies must adapt their business models for markets beyond major metros, manage rising competition, and optimize supply chains as the market evolves into a two-speed proposition—offering select products in under 15 minutes and a wider assortment within an hour.

Q-commerce can face complex logistics challenges as it grows into more cities and adds bigger products such as consumer durables to its offerings. How well q-commerce platforms handle these challenges will determine their expansion into e-commerce market share.
The sector may struggle to maintain its current pace of growth as expansion beyond major cities remains limited and competition from larger e-commerce players intensifies, says a recent report by Blume Ventures. will soon see its monthly transacting user (MTU) growth tapering, much like the country's ride-share, food delivery and e-commerce sectors before, the report warned. The expanding sector will likely start to affect the local grocery ecosystem and attract regulatory measures to check its growth, the report said. Blume Ventures was one of the earliest backers of crisis-laden quick-commerce firm Dunzo, which is reportedly on the brink of shutdown after a spate of layoffs, founder exits and unpaid vendor dues.
A top Indian private equity fund's chief has said that the q-commerce frenzy, which has boosted the fortunes of Zomato and Swiggy, is not sustainable in the long run. ""These are passing fads and fantasies,""
TVS Capital
Funds Chairman Gopal Srinivasan, who manages assets worth about 50 billion rupees ($575 million), said in an interview to Reuters last month.
""The question is whether this micro trend, which (is) running completely on PE or VC funding only without the multi-decadal (economic viability) aspect, will sustain or not.""

"Bureau of Indian Standards seizes products from Amazon, Flipkart warehouses as crackdown intensifies",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/bureau-of-indian-standards-seizes-products-from-amazon-flipkart-warehouses-as-crackdown-intensifies/articleshow/119590961.cms,27-03-2025,"State-run product certification agency said it raided the Delhi warehouses of e-commerce giants
Amazon
and
Flipkart
this month, seizing items that did not meet quality control standards, as it increased its scrutiny of the two firms.
Last week, the
Bureau of Indian Standards
conducted similar searches at the companies' warehouses in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, saying they stored, sold, and exhibited items that did not have a required standards label.
Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have said they comply with local laws. They did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the Delhi raids.
Both are the dominant players in India's e-commerce market which, according to estimates by consultancy firm Bain, was worth between $57 billion and $60 billion in 2023, and could top $160 billion in value by 2028.
The agency said on Thursday it has seized items including geysers and food mixers worth about 7 million rupees ($81,561) in warehouses operated by an Amazon subsidiary in Delhi.

The seized products either lacked the standard quality control mark, or carried fake labels, the agency said.
It seized almost $7,000 worth of sports shoes from a Flipkart unit, which were ready for dispatch but did not carry necessary product certification marks.
The warehouse seizures are the latest troubles for Amazon and Flipkart in India. An antitrust investigation last September found the companies had violated local competition laws by giving preference to selected sellers on their shopping websites.
A 2021 Reuters investigation, based on internal Amazon documents, showed the company had for years given preferential treatment to small groups of sellers, and used them to bypass Indian laws. Amazon denied any wrongdoing.

direct selling industry
has crossed Rs 22,000 crore in sales and the number of direct sellers has increased to 88 lakh, an annual survey report for 2023-24 by the Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA) said.
The report said the sector recorded a turnover of Rs 22,142 crore in FY 2023-24, growing 4.4 per cent year-on-year.
The survey, conducted by research firm
IPSOS

"Regulatory environments around the world, including in India, are ""a little frustrating"", says Amway Corp's Doug DeVos",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/regulatory-environments-around-the-world-including-in-india-are-a-little-frustrating-says-amway-corps-doug-devos/articleshow/119496168.cms,29-03-2025,"Regulatory environments around the world, including in India, are “a little frustrating” when it comes to direct selling policies, said
Doug DeVos
, global co-chairman of the Amway Board of Directors, and son of the $7.4 billion Amway Corp’s co-founder Rich DeVos.
The direct selling company, which makes Nutrilite protein powder and Glister toothpaste, sells its products to consumers primarily through its distributors, and not through physical or online stores.
“There’s a perception that there’s something very different about direct selling or it’s secret. I would say we’ve been the most transparent company; there are no secrets on how the business works; we just access the market slightly differently,” said DeVos.
Calling India, along with the United States and China as “three really strong, powerful markets in the world economy”, DeVos said: “India’s role will continue to grow and we want to be part of it.”
Addressing a query on the regulatory lens on direct selling companies, DeVos said: ""We’re like a retailer but a little different; we’re pretty normal, our compensation plans are published, our products are front and centre. If someone doesn’t want to listen, I don’t know how to answer that.”
Live Events
Three years ago, the Enforcement Directorate had attached Rs 750 crore worth of assets belonging to
Amway India
under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), alleging that Amway is running a ‘pyramid fraud’ in the guise of multi-level marketing, and that prices of most
Amway products
are “exorbitant compared to alternative products in the open market”. At that time, the company had responded that “the investigation dates back to 2011 and that it has been committed to all legal and regulatory compliances”.
DeVos added that the government's progress on the regulatory front has been one of the areas that it has been working on with the authorities for quite some time, while accepting “there’ll always be room to learn and reflect on the standards around the world”.
Amway India Enterprises’ losses doubled to Rs 52.78 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, according to RoC filings. Sales were flat at Rs 1,283.75 crore in the year.
In 2023, the consumer affairs ministry had modified the Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules, 2021 through a notification to distinguish between fraudulent pyramid and money-circulation schemes and legitimate, direct selling players. But industry body
Indian Direct Sellers Association
(IDSA) has said further clarity is needed in the definition of 'network of sellers’.
Amway, which sells nutrition supplements, skin-care products and toothpaste through 550,000 distributors, competes with FMCG products that are seeing double-digit growth on quick commerce delivery platforms—a channel the company has stayed away from.
“We’ve been addressing and dealing with this. Globally, 80-85% of our orders are being taken online from our distributors. But we still believe the element of personal relationships in the marketplace brings value... it is a differentiator for us,” DeVos said. He said Amway “wants to connect technology in quick commerce but with a relationship”.
In India, he said, the direct selling company is now delivering to consumers directly within 24 hours on its own platform. Last September, the India unit of the Michigan-headquartered company announced the setting up of four research and development (R&D) labs here on an investment of $4 million to develop health and well-being products for its domestic and overseas markets.
Amway reported global sales of $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a 3% decline over the previous year, which it attributed to the strength of the US dollar.
In multilevel marketing, companies sell products and services in a pyramid-shaped commission system, where key distributors recruit new distributors under them. These distributors earn when consumers buy products through them, and also earn when they recruit new distributors. All distributors need to pay a registration fee to the company.

quick commerce
(10-minute delivery) companies are now exploring planned grocery purchases, a segment previously led by
BigBasket
, in an effort to tap into household bulk buying. However, an HSBC report highlights that this strategy comes with trade-offs, especially regarding profitability.
New value-oriented programs like
Zepto
's Super-Saver provide significant discounts but require higher minimum order values, often more than twice the typical average order value. While this approach boosts basket sizes, HSBC analysts point out that it also squeezes EBITDA margins, lowering them from approximately 6% to 3%.
It added that market leader
Blinkit
remains a premium-priced convenience player, avoiding deep discounts in favour of expanding categories and geographical reach. Swiggy Instamart falls somewhere in between the two, with competitive pricing but without the same push into bulk purchases.
Zomato
's Blinkit does not have a loyalty programme like Zepto Pass or Swiggy One.
Quick commerce thrives on high-frequency, low-ticket orders, serving as a supplement to modern retail rather than a replacement. Expanding into the value retail segment could reshape this dynamic. ""BigBasket's original model was this. Now you see even quick commerce looking this way. They are going behind DMart's target group, to beat the perception that quick commerce is priced on the higher side. Amazon India's original play in groceries had also taken this approach,"" Satish Meena, adviser at Datum Intelligence, told TOI.

Why buying thrifted clothes is getting more appealing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/why-buying-thrifted-clothes-is-getting-more-appealing/articleshow/119211362.cms,19-03-2025,"Shoppers around the world are quickly adding more used shoes, accessories and clothes to their closets. Last year, they spent $227 billion on
secondhand apparel
, accounting for nearly 10% of all global spending on clothes, according to a new report from online resale marketplace ThredUp Inc.
The trend is set to accelerate, particularly in the US where President Donald Trump’s tariffs are likely to increase the price of new clothes, and globally thanks to a changing attitudes and artificial intelligence-aided shopping.
“You’re starting to see more and more consumers come to resale,” says James Reinhart, chief executive officer and co-founder of ThredUp. “Once people start shopping secondhand, they keep doing it.”
Consumers can now buy secondhand at a growing number of places. Alongside donation and vintage shops, there’s a growing online ecosystem for buying used, including eBay, ThredUp, Poshmark and other marketplaces where customers can directly sell and purchase items.
More brands are also setting up their own online resale offerings, either independently or by outsourcing to companies that provide resale services, including Archive and Trove.
Live Events
The latter has around 50 clients, including the addition of seven brands in the second half of 2024, according to Terry Boyle, the company's chief executive officer. Outdoor apparel maker Patagonia Inc, athleisure brand Lululemon Athletica Inc, and sneaker seller AllBirds Inc are all among those that use Trove’s services.
To attract more shoppers, some brands are looking to integrate resale with the rest of their business by launching shared online checkouts, as well as spending on third-party marketing for resale, according to Boyle.
Global secondhand fashion sales, which rose 15% in 2024 from the previous year, are projected to surpass $250 billion in 2025 and then exceed $300 billion in 2027, according to the report published Wednesday, based on ThredUp data and research from the third-party retail analytics firm GlobalData.
A better deal
A big reason why consumers buy used is because it’s affordable. Shopping secondhand let’s people get deals on all sorts of items, including garments from higher-end brands that may normally be out of reach if purchased new, according to the report.
In the US, President Trump’s recently imposed blanket 20% tariffs on all Chinese imports are expected to raise the costs of new clothing sold nationwide, which would expand the price gap between new and used items, explains Reinhart. While most new clothing sold in the US is produced overseas, largely in China, much of the apparel sold secondhand in the US comes from inside the country.
Shifting tastes
Consumer sentiment has also changed. Historically, there was a stigma around secondhand shopping, but “it’s now become the norm,” says Samina Virk, US chief executive officer for the high-end online resale marketplace Vestiaire Collective.
Online secondhand shopping is especially popular among younger generations, which have grown up with the internet and are comfortable buying and selling their clothes online, she adds.
Some consumers also are turning to secondhand items to avoid the greenhouse emissions generated by producing and transporting new clothes. Similarly, some people choose to sell their used clothes rather than trashing them because it’s more environmentally friendly. Vestiaire Collective’s data suggest that 79% of items sold on its site replace a firsthand purchase.
AI-assisted shopping
Reinhart points to another trend that could bump up used apparel sales in 2025 and beyond: AI.
Sorting through secondhand items to find exactly what you’re looking for can be clunky and time-intensive, especially online. To overcome this obstacle, Thredup is deploying AI tools that allow users to upload a picture of a shoe or jacket they want and sort through the site to find similar items.
This kind of experimentation in the coming years will help making shopping secondhand online just as seamless as buying new, Reinhart predicts.

"Amid Amazon and Flipkart warehouse raids, spotlight falls on a major originator of non-certified products",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amid-amazon-and-flipkart-warehouse-raids-spotlight-falls-on-a-major-originator-of-non-certified-products/articleshow/119142976.cms,18-03-2025,"The
Bureau of Indian Standards
(
BIS
) has carried out major search and seizure operations at the warehouses of e-commerce biggies
Amazon
and
Flipkart
. According to a statement from the Consumer Affairs Ministry issued on March 17, these raids are part of efforts to eliminate the distribution of non-compliant products via e-commerce platforms.
These raids specifically put one company in the spotlight owing to its link to a majority of these products.
The operations, which took place in cities such as Lucknow, Gurugram, and Delhi, focused on Amazon and Flipkart's warehouses, as well as the facilities of
Techvision International
Pvt Ltd, a major supplier of the non-certified products. During the raids, investigators uncovered various uncertified items, including toys, kitchen appliances, and electrical equipment.
Notably, the raids at Amazon's warehouses in Lucknow and Gurugram led to the confiscation of hundreds of uncertified items, such as toys, hand blenders, aluminum foils, metallic water bottles, PVC cables, food mixers, and speakers. Similarly, a Flipkart warehouse managed by Instakart Services Pvt Ltd in Gurugram was found to contain numerous uncertified stainless steel bottles, toys, and speakers.
The investigation by BIS traced these non-certified products back to
Techvision
International Pvt Ltd, prompting further raids at two of their facilities in Delhi. The ministry reported that these operations revealed approximately 7,000 electric water heaters, 4,000 electric food mixers, 95 electric room heaters, and 40 gas stoves—all lacking the mandatory BIS certification. Brands associated with these non-compliant products include Digismart, Activa, Inalsa, Cello Swift, and Butterfly.
Live Events
The Consumer Affairs Ministry underscored the necessity of BIS certification for these products due to the potential dangers they pose. Non-certified items, which do not bear the ISI Mark or have an invalid license number, have not undergone independent testing to ensure they meet essential safety and performance standards.
BIS has identified a range of non-certified products being sold across various e-commerce platforms, including Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, Myntra, and BigBasket.
In response to these violations, BIS has initiated legal proceedings under the BIS Act, 2016, against the implicated parties, including filing two court cases against Techvision International Pvt Ltd. Penalties for these infractions can range from two lakh rupees to ten times the value of the goods, with the possibility of imprisonment for up to two years.
BIS is currency conducting market surveillance and rigorous testing of consumer products to ensure adherence to safety and quality regulations.
To enhance consumer protection, BIS encourages individuals to utilize the BIS Care app, which allows users to verify the authenticity of BIS certifications and report non-compliant products. The app provides essential information on items that require mandatory BIS certification and enables consumers to check the ISI Mark and the manufacturer's license number.
This initiative is designed to empower consumers to make informed purchasing decisions and ensure the safety of products available in the market.
BIS urges consumers to take advantage of the BIS Care app to make educated purchasing choices. The app offers critical insights into products needing mandatory BIS certification and allows users to confirm the validity of a product's certification by checking the ISI Mark and the manufacturer's license number (CM/L).
Additionally, the app facilitates lodging complaints about products lacking the ISI Mark or reporting quality issues concerning BIS-certified items.

Large retailers stop discounts in shoppers' online lifestyle to let stores profit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/full-price-as-retail-growth-strategy-dont-discount-it/articleshow/119085308.cms,17-03-2025,"Large Indian retailers are starting to shun discounts and have fewer product price markdowns online.
The shift in strategy at retail chains such as
Shoppers Stop
,
Arvind Fashions
,
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
and Lifestyle tracks their inability to reboot sales online sufficiently despite running persistent discounts including the more-recent End-of-Season-Sales (EOSS) and Republic Day sales.
Online still under pressure
These discounts included the more-recent End-of-SeasonSales (EOSS) and Republic Day sales.
Brands are also sharpening their focus on brick-and-mortar stores to sustain profitable growth, moving away from the fiercely competitive online market.
“We have completely come out of discounting online and moved to fresh stock at full price. As a result, we have seen our brick-and-mortar sales recover, but online sales are still struggling since the channel is used to having discounts,” said Devarajan Iyer, chief executive officer at Lifestyle International, India’s biggest departmental chain.

“We give offers only to liquidate old stock but discounted merchandise as a percentage of sales has come down dramatically.”
Retailers have been battling a sales slowdown for the past two years as inflation and financial pressures weighed on consumer spending. In addition, the market was witness to a flurry of digital-first brands which thrived on discounts, especially after the pandemic. Such brands not only gained market share at the expense of the established retailers but also forced some to lower prices.
Biju Kassim, CEO-beauty at Shoppers Stop, said the market is overheated and it is tough to continue to sustain offers, and promotions, and grow the business simultaneously. “Obviously, we are not going to ignore the competitive landscape, but we’ll try and do what is appropriate so that we don’t get into that desperate measure and get suck-ed into that situation where then you are compelled to burn to earn,” said Kassim.
Brands said in spite of cutting back on discounts, marketplaces are reducing their own margins and offering additional discounts especially during EOSS or special days to boost revenues. This is despite foreign direct investment rules on ecommerce restricting marketplaces from influencing the selling price of goods and services.
“We mostly do discounting only during End of Season Sale or such other select similar occasions and all such discounts are controlled by us. Marketplaces do not add to the discount that we as a brand are offering. We ensure that the brand values are not diluted and hence we control the pricing,” said Rajesh Jain, managing director at Lacoste India.
Neetu Kashiramka, managing director at luggage maker
VIP Industries
, said online platforms are giving discounts and in fact, selling below their purchase price. “That is the big problem, and they are investing in the brand (themselves) and not in us,” she said.
In India, more than a third of apparel sold by retailers on discounts or EOSS are due to mismatches between planned inventory and actual sales, according to Vector Consulting Group which partnered NielsenIQ for a report.
Companies, however, said they are tightening their back ends to narrow the demand-supply gap. “In the past, there was also a lot of inventory from the liquidation of old season merchandise. So, as we made our inventory sharper, we have had less of that (discount). The kind of business that we want to grow within ecommerce is a lesser discount, more profitable growth path,” Ashish Dikshit, managing director of Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, told investors recently

Retailers report 52% drop in essential goods sales in urban centres due to rise of quick commerce,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-report-52-drop-in-essential-goods-sales-due-to-quick-commerce/articleshow/119064112.cms,16-03-2025,"The rise of
quick commerce
has caused a significant decline in the sale of food, beverages and confectionery in urban centres, as 52 per cent of physical store retailers reported experiencing the drop, according to a report by global consulting firm PwC.
The report says that beyond food, personal care (47 per cent) and household cleaning (33 per cent) are also experiencing significant sales reductions.
This suggests that quick-delivery models are more disruptive for consumables that consumers frequently purchase in-store.
Quick commerce, also known as q-commerce or on-demand delivery, is a type of e-commerce that can deliver orders in 10 to 30 minutes or less.
However, the report added that despite the downturn in essential categories, niche markets such as childcare, beauty, and wellness appear to be less affected.
Live Events
This could point to the fact that these categories often involve more considered purchasing decisions, where customers may prefer to shop in-store or may have less immediate need for quick delivery services.
On the flip side, q-commerce's expansion into tier 2 and tier 3 regions, as per our research, reveals a contrasting narrative as non-metro cities' retailers remain largely unpressured by Q-commerce's entry.
On the other hand, q-commerce's growth in
tier 2 and tier 3 cities
tells a different story. Retailers in the non-metro areas are largely unaffected by q-commerce.
The challenges in these regions include high delivery costs due to longer distances and inefficient inventory management caused by scattered demand, the report added.
The report adds that despite the aggressive expansion of quick commerce businesses in India, brick-and-mortar retail remains a robust channel in the tier 2 and tier 3 cities.
While several striking findings emerged in the survey, one that caught PwC's attention was the continued success of brick-and-mortar retail in tier 2 and 3 cities.
The retail market in India is expected to grow to USD 1,892 billion by 2029-30, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3 per cent, with e-commerce, the fastest growing channel, notching a CAGR of 22.5 per cent and touching USD 220 billion by 2029-30, as per the report.
The
PwC report
found that nearly 50 percent of Indian consumers prefer a hybrid model, including both online and offline options, when making purchases.

Retail chains & restaurants shut stores as consumption slows,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-chains-restaurants-shut-stores-as-consumption-slows/articleshow/119054679.cms,16-03-2025,"Kolkata: Several lifestyle retail chains and restaurants are shutting stores on the high street and in smaller towns as overall consumption has slowed over the past year.
The Pantaloons departmental chain run by
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd
(ABFRL) has exited over 40 stores in tier-two and smaller markets in this period. Most
Shoppers Stop
stores that have been closed are at high-street locations because they ""have lost that critical mass"" and the company is trying to move them inside malls.
Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd
, which runs multiple
quick service restaurants
, said there is a decline in dine-in orders for pizza chain Domino's stores on the high street, even though footfall in mall outlets is robust.
Titan Co. said it has changed its strategy for ethnic wear retail chain Taneira and will only focus on cities and large towns, moving away from expansion in smaller towns. Retailers such as Lifestyle International and
Arvind Fashions Ltd
said they are focussing primarily on malls for their new stores.
Chief executives said these closures are due to retailers overstating the potential of smaller towns during the post-Covid 'revenge shopping' boom and most high streets losing out as footfalls tend to be greater in malls during a
consumption slowdown
.
Live Events
""Most retailers have overestimated the potential of smaller towns with consumption in these markets continuing to be subdued,"" said Devaranjan Iyer, chief executive of department store chain Lifestyle International.
Longer Recovery Time in Towns
""Standalone stores in main shopping streets are fine, but a lot of expansion has happened in other places. Getting the location right is extremely important."" ABFRL managing director Ashish Dikshit said the company's expansion into smaller towns was taking time to bear fruit.
""Most of our store closures were consistent with this sort of phenomenon, which is smaller towns taking longer to recover. And that's where a lot of rationalisation has happened,"" he told analysts recently. Pantaloons is shifting to a premium positioning that isn't in sync with smaller towns and smaller size stores, Dikshit said, necessitating the closures. The company is closing a few more Pantaloons stores this quarter and future expansion will be largely in metros, mini-metros and tier-one towns. Sales in India's retail sector has slowed due to subdued consumption for almost 10 quarters now, hitting apparel, footwear retail and quick service restaurants hard. As per estimates by the
Retailers Association of India
grouping, sales growth of organised retailers slowed down to a mid-single digit in 2024 compared with 15% in 2022.
DECLINE IN DINE-IN
Jubilant FoodWorks chief executive officer Sameer Khetarpal said the learning from the rest of the world and Domino's is that on the high street, the business of dine-in business is declining.

"Amazon reaffirms commitment to compliance, consumer safety after BIS raids on non-certified products",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/bis-cracks-down-on-e-commerce-platforms-conducts-search-ops-at-warehouses-of-amazon-flipkart-and-others/articleshow/119047018.cms,16-03-2025,"In light of recent
Bureau of Indian Standards
(BIS) raids at several warehouses of major e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, Amazon has reiterated its commitment to maintaining industry standards and regulatory compliance.
BIS conducted search and seizure operations in cities including Lucknow, Gurugram, and Delhi, revealing
non-certified products
on the platforms.
“We require sellers of all products to comply with applicable laws, regulations and Amazon policies. We ensure our selection meets industry-accepted standards, and we develop innovative tools to prevent unsafe products from being listed,” Amazon said in an official statement, responding to the growing concerns.
“We take actions to maintain a safe selection for our customers, including removing noncompliant products, and outreach to sellers, manufacturers, and government agencies for additional information, when appropriate,” the company added.
Amazon, Flipkart warehouses raided
BIS carried out search and seizure operations at multiple warehouse locations of leading e-commerce platforms on Saturday, including Amazon and Flipkart, in cities like Lucknow, Gurugram and Delhi, according to the press release.
Live Events
In a recent raid conducted on March 7, 2025 at an Amazon warehouse in Lucknow, BIS seized 215 toys and 24 hand blenders, all lacking mandatory BIS certification. Earlier, in February 2025, a similar operation at an Amazon warehouse in Gurugram resulted in the seizure of 58 aluminium foils, 34 metallic water bottles, 25 toys, 20 hand blenders, 7 PVC cables, 2 food mixers and 1 speaker – all found to be non-certified.
Similarly, in a raid at a Flipkart warehouse in Gurugram, operated by Instakart Services Pvt Ltd, BIS seized 534 stainless steel bottles (vacuum insulated), 134 toys and 41 speakers, that were not certified. BIS’s investigations into multiple violations on both Amazon and Flipkart traced non-certified products back to Techvision International Pvt Ltd.
""Acting on this lead, BIS conducted raids at two different facilities of Techvision International in Delhi, uncovering approximately 7,000 electric water heaters, 4,000 electric food mixers, 95 electric room heaters, and 40 gas stoves, without BIS certification. Non-certified products seized include brands like Digismart, Activa, Inalsa, Cello Swift, Butterfly among others,"" said the press release by BIS.
Following the seizure of material, BIS initiates legal action under BIS Act, 2016 to hold the responsible entities accountable. BIS has already filed two court cases against M/s Techvision International Pvt Ltd for violations of Sections 17(1) and 17(3) of the BIS Act, 2016.
Additional cases are in the process of being filed for other seizure operations. Under Section 17 of the BIS Act, 2016, defaulters face a penalty not less than two lakh rupees, which may extend up to ten times the value of the goods sold or offered for sale.
Furthermore, depending on the severity of the violation, offenders may also face imprisonment of up to two years, said the statement.
Certification accessibility
However, the broader issue of ensuring accessibility of BIS certification to millions of producers and sellers remains a concern.
“The bigger issue is making BIS certification easily accessible to millions of producers and sellers so they don't have to produce or vend non-certified products,” said Vinod Kumar, President of the India SME Forum, noted.
He also cautioned that the increasing reliance on e-commerce platforms might drive online sellers to integrate into offline communities, which could conflict with the government’s objectives.
""Ecommerce platforms are just the tip of the iceberg, looking at the millions of retail outlets. These searches only at the smaller segment could drive online sellers to be part of offline community, which is against the Government's objective,"" he added.

"Quick Commerce accounts now for 70-75 pc of total e-grocery orders, up from 35 pc in 2022: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-accounts-now-for-70-75-pc-of-total-e-grocery-orders-up-from-35-pc-in-2022-report/articleshow/118920858.cms,12-03-2025,"New Delhi:
Quick commerce
is rapidly transforming the
online grocery market
, now accounting for 70 per cent -75 per cent of total
e-grocery orders
, according to a recent report by Bain & Company.
The report also highlighted that this marks a significant increase from around 35 per cent in 2022. The shift has been driven by strong execution, rising incomes, a wider range of available products, and the growing demand for convenience.
It said ""Robust customer traction, Quick
commerce
already accounts for 70 per cent-75 per cent of e-grocery orders (vs. approx. 35 per cent in 2022)"".
The report stated that the increasing popularity of quick commerce is also reshaping the competitive landscape. Major players such as
Flipkart Minutes
,
Nykaa
, and Myntra have entered the sector, along with new entrants like Swish and Slikk.
This heightened competition is expected to further drive innovation and expansion in the industry. To keep up with rising consumer demand, quick commerce platforms are optimizing their storage and logistics.
Live Events
Companies are setting up 'back' dark stores in high-demand areas, which are connected to 4-5 'forward' dark stores. These back-end stores stock an additional 3,000-4,000 products, mainly premium and high-value items, to cater to a broader customer base.
The report also highlighted how quick commerce is boosting the growth of
direct-to-consumer
(D2C) brands. Improved market reach and hyper-targeted marketing strategies are allowing D2C startups to use quick commerce platforms as a strategic sales channel. Many startups are now dedicating specific budgets to quick commerce to enhance their visibility and sales.
The profit of quick commerce segment is also rising and there are several factors contributing to the increasing profitability.
With the expansion of product categories and higher free delivery threshold, companies see a 40 per cent rise in average order value (AOV) between FY23 and FY25.
Additionally, a greater share of high-margin products, such as D2C offerings, and new revenue streams like advertising are helping improve gross margins by 3-4 percentage points.
Operational efficiency is also improving, with more dark stores now processing over 1,000 orders per day, leading to better cost management. Furthermore, logistical densification has reduced per-shipment costs by 25 per cent in 2024 compared to 2023.
With these strategic advancements, Quick Commerce is set to continue its rapid growth, further strengthening its position as the dominant force in the online grocery market.

Stock market woes hit retail sales across sectors,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/stock-market-woes-hit-retail-sales-across-sectors/articleshow/118743115.cms,06-03-2025,"The negative sentiment around volatile domestic stock markets is rippling out and has started hurting sales of consumer goods that recently showed some green shoots of recovery.
Sales of two-wheelers, luxury cars, smartphones, refrigerators, television sets and premium apparel are showing the effects, with several manufacturers posting slower sales in February, from the previous month.
Many Indians have moved savings to investments in stocks and mutual funds over the last couple of years, said Jyoti Malhotra, managing director at Volvo Car India. ""Stock markets are currently showing a lot of volatility, affecting everybody. When you see your investments in the red, you would not want to make fresh purchases.""

Reliance, DMart and other top retailers go easy on store launches as slowdown hurts
Smartphone sales in February fell 10-15% from January, according to the All India Mobile Retailers Association. Sales of refrigerators and televisions declined by 7-10% sequentially in February, faster than a 5-6% fall in January, show industry estimates.
Live Events
Wedding Demand Insulated
Sales of motorcycles and scooters, which grew about 2% year-on-year in January, also crashed last month. Two-wheeler registrations, according to the Vahan portal, fell 6% sequentially the past month. Dispatches from factories to dealerships, meanwhile, are estimated to have reduced by 9% from a year earlier. Official numbers are to be released.
Bajaj Auto
executive director Rakesh Sharma has, in media interactions, blamed volatility in the stock markets for the fall in motorcycle sales. ""At the end of the day, so much of sentiment is involved when it comes to discretionary purchases, be it holidays or even motorcycles. When there are headwinds, people tend to postpone or even downgrade purchases,"" he said.
However, wedding-related demand has remained insulated - between October last year and February - from the share market fall, most consumer goods companies reported in their latest earnings calls.
Bear Blues
The Indian share market has been on a downtrend for the past five months, with the slide intensifying in the last couple of weeks for many reasons, including US President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on multiple nations.
The benchmark BSE Sensex has dropped 14% from a high of nearly 86,000 in September to Wednesday's close of 73,730.23-though it ended 1% up on Wednesday.
Market experts see the current investor sentiment as the most bearish since March 2020, when stock markets crashed on Covid fears. The impact, they said, could effectively wipe out the savings that the middle class was expecting from the tax cuts announced in the budget.
""Indian retail has lost $500-700 billion in the current bear market already,"" Shankar Sharma, share market investor and GQuant Investec founder, wrote on X. ""Still, expect the 'cumin seed in camel mouth' $12 billion tax cut to help (consumption).""
The sentiment is not good now since the portfolios of many who had started investing when the markets peaked after Covid are in the red, said NS Satish, president of appliance manufacturer Haier India. ""Consumption has already been impacted and the impact may continue except in categories like AC, which has become a necessity due to extreme heat,"" he said.
All India Mobile Retailers Association chairman Kailash Lakhyani said had Samsung not launched the new S25 series smartphone in February, sales would have shrunk even more in the past month. The association represents more than 150,000 mobile phone retailers.
Postponing Buys
Top executives said the share market fall will further delay consumption recovery, even as low- to mid-income consumers are subdued by high inflation, as well as low wage and earnings growth.
Several people have been posting on social media about postponing purchases of new iPhones, cars, bikes, and even deferring marriages due to the share market crash.
The chief of a leading global apparel brand said the company's growth rate slowed in February to 15%, from 25% in January. Haier's growth rate too has slowed to 33%, from a high of 49%.
A large two-wheeler distributor said that while two-wheeler retails (sales to customers) increased about 6% from a year earlier in February on account of marriages, growth has been substantially lower than that usually seen during the season. Retail sales were also lower sequentially, as captured by the Vahan portal. ""In fact, total vehicle registrations across categories have dropped, which indicates that the entire industry is under pressure,"" he said.

An ET analysis of a dozen top listed quick-service restaurant (QSR) chains, apparel and grocery retailers showed collective additions of an average of just three new stores per day last year, compared to about ten outlets in 2023.
These companies which include Reliance Retail, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, DMart, Tata's Trent,
Titan

Retailers, however, said their store consolidation phase is over and they are preparing for the next round of network expansion.
""Some of our margin-draining retail stores have been taken off. So, that also augurs well for the overall network. And to that extent, we are also cranking up the expansion machinery once again. So that will give us another wave of growth as we go along,"" Vishak Kumar, CEO, lifestyle business at Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail told investors.
Shoppers Stop
MD Kavindra Mishra too said rationalisation of the store network will mostly end this fiscal. ""We are at the end of the cycle of rationalising our stores. I don't see a lot of stores getting closed or rationalised in the coming year. In FY26, we are looking anywhere between 12-15 stores opening,"" he said.
Sales of discretionary items such as apparel, footwear and beauty started slowing in 2023 after two years of pandemic-induced runway growth. The slowdown persisted even in 2024.
According to the Retailers Association of India (RAI), sales growth in the organised retail segments such as apparel, footwear, beauty and QSR slowed to a mid-single digit last calendar year, compared to 15% in 2022. As a result, most retailers closed several unviable stores, a trend expected to continue as companies seek to boost profitability.
""The net additions have been flattish. That does not mean that we have not added. Gross additions have been there but what we have aggressively also done for the last about six to nine months is that we have also closed unprofitable stores,"" said Gunjan Shah, MD,
Bata India
. ""My sense is it will be there for another quarter or so, but then the gross additions will keep happening.""
Companies blame several factors behind the consumption slowdown - high food inflation, low salary hikes, high debt by consumers, slowdown in new job creation, and increase in housing rentals and home prices. At the same time, prices especially of real estate remained higher.
""Post FY23 and after the Covid bump, we saw rental sort of shooting up and we were not comfortable signing certain leases, and we decided to go slow because these are long-term leases, for 7 to 9 years. It doesn't make sense just to hit a number, sign something which is going to come and bite you later,"" said Kaushal Parekh, chief financial officer at
Metro Brands
.
""What we are seeing now, is slight tapering off in terms of the rental expectations. And hence, it gives us that opportunity to push the paddle. And we always said, when there too much euphoria in the market, you might see us going slightly slow. And when we see the environment coming back, when there is slight pessimism in the market, that's the time when we get best rental deals, and that's what we will try and push,"" he added.

Blackstone nears $400 mn deal for Kolkata's South City Mall,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/blackstone-nears-400-mn-deal-for-kolkatas-south-city-mall/articleshow/118733349.cms,05-03-2025,"Blackstone
Inc., one of the largest landlords in India, is nearing a deal to acquire South City Mall in Kolkata for as much as $400 million, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The $1.1 trillion asset manager, which has deployed $20 billion in office space and hotels in India, is in conversations with financiers to line up funding for the transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.
The shopping mall is owned by
South City Projects
(Kolkata) Ltd., a joint venture of several real estate developers based in the city, and is the largest in eastern India, according to its website. It has brands like Zara, Sephora and Marks & Spencer in addition to movie theaters and a gaming arena.
Blackstone is looking to tap into consumer spending that drives almost 60% of India’s gross domestic product, the people said. The firm has been investing in warehouses that capture the boom in e-commerce, and the mall acquisition would extend that to brick and mortar stores, they added.
Representatives from Blackstone declined to comment. South City Projects didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The Indian retail market is expected to reach over ₹190 lakh crore by 2034 and retailers capable of embracing the country's diverse demographics and contrasting consumer behaviours stand to gain the most, according to the report
With distinct consumer groups, each with their own unique needs even within a city, retailers will need to recognise the different opportunities and pick sharply where they want to play to be successful in 'Bharat' and 'India', said the report.
At the heart of this expansion lies an increasingly discerning and diverse consumer base. More households are moving into affluence and at the same time, value-for-money remains key to decision-making, hence retailers must strike a careful balance between driving aspiration and maintaining affordability..
""Even as India remains the fastest-growing major economy, its population is marked by striking contrasts, a burgeoning middle class and rising affluence alongside price-conscious consumers, a digitally savvy Gen Z coexisting with an increasingly significant 45-plus cohort, and an expanding female workforce helping shape new purchase behaviours,"" the report said.

The report pointed out that omnichannel dynamic has been crucial with surging digital payment transactions and online penetration continuing to climb. Yet the majority of purchase pathways, over 58%, still remain purely offline.

The retail market in India reached a size of Rs 82 lakh crore in 2024, up from Rs 35 lakh crore in 2014, growing at over 8.9 per cent in the last decade, driven by the India's economic growth and an increasingly discerning and diverse consumer base, said the report titled 'Winning in Bharat & India: The Retail Kaleidoscope'.

While there are opportunities to tap, retailers will have to negotiate complexities in order to be successful, it noted.
""Even as India remains the fastest-growing major economy, its population is marked by striking contrasts, a burgeoning middle class and rising affluence alongside price-conscious consumers, a digitally savvy Gen Z coexisting with an increasingly significant 45-plus cohort, and an expanding female workforce helping shape new purchase behaviours,"" the report highlighted.
These trends intersect to create what can be called a ""retail kaleidoscope"", where opportunity abounds but complexity also rises, it noted.
The report pointed out that omnichannel dynamic has been crucial with surging digital payment transactions and online penetration continuing to climb. Yet the majority of purchase pathways, over 58 per cent, still remain purely offline.
While consumers are inspired by global trends and brands, a strong drive for local pride exists, it noted. ""Looking forward, retailers capable of embracing India's diverse demographics and contrasting consumer behaviours stand to gain the most,"" the report said.
By forging strategies that merge consumer-centric insights with sharp execution-- online, offline, or both-- companies can not only keep pace with the nation's growth but also set the benchmark for the next decade of retail success. ""Winning in Bharat and India requires retailers to recognise the different opportunities, and pick sharply where they want to play, and play there well,"" it said. The report pointed out that successful retailers have deliberately chosen the consumer segments to prioritise.
""Some excel by championing efficiency and value in mass grocery or fast fashion, whereas others command premium segments through exclusive assortments, superior in-store experiences, and advanced digital tools,"" it said. In all cases, a well-aligned operating model-- covering merchandise, pricing, in-store and omni-experience, network, and promotion-- is crucial to delivering on the chosen customer value proposition, the report said.

"AI to have big impact on entire chain of investing, says former HUL MD Sanjiv Mehta",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ai-to-have-big-impact-on-entire-chain-of-investing-says-former-hul-md-sanjiv-mehta/articleshow/118652094.cms,01-03-2025,"AI will have a big impact on the entire chain of investing from identifying categories where one wants to invest to the timing of exit and creating value, Executive Chairman of the
L Catterton India
and former Managing Director
HUL
,
Sanjiv Mehta
said on Saturday. He also said that the India-focussed joint venture that he formed with global investment firm L Catterton's Asian arm to develop a new investment vehicle is primarily focused on consumers, which is his ""sweet spot..
""If you look at the investment journey, this entire
private equity
journey, it starts with identifying where you want to invest. Then you look at identifying what could be your potential investment in a portfolio company. Then you decide the timing of investment and how much to invest. Then it is the classical creation of value. And the value is what I described, how technology will reshape value creation,"" Mehta said at the Mumbai Tech Week, which concluded here on Saturday.
Noting that the last thing is determining when to exit, he said that's the whole value chain of private equity.
""And if you really look at it, technology will impact everybody. First is identifying, where do you want to invest? What are going to be the trends? Where do you think the market is shaping up? That again, your AI is going to play a big role,"" he said.
And it (the use of AI) is going to cut time and cost dramatically, he said, adding then comes identifying companies that are doing due diligence.

""Due diligence used to take a huge amount of time and money. That will cut down dramatically and you would be able to zero in. These are the potential assets that we can zero in on. Again, technology, AI will help you immensely. Then it is all about the timing of investments where you can again see the patterns, where you can again see what would be the growth of the industry? When do you get in? And then you would create value,"" Mehta said.
""And again, using technology, you would determine what would be the most fertile time to exit the portfolio. So, I believe AI will have a big impact on the entire chain of investing. From identifying categories where you want to invest to the timing of exit and creating value,"" he said.

India is the fastest growing market for US Polo: CEO,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-is-the-fastest-growing-market-for-us-polo-ceo/articleshow/118649581.cms,01-03-2025,"India has outpaced rest of the global market of the retail brand US Polo in terms of sales growth, becoming the third largest market for the company after US and Turkey, said J Michael Prince, President and CEO of
United States Polo Association
(USPA),
The company, which has doubled the sale to $2.6 billion in 2024 from $1.3 billion in 2018, said India is a crucial market for growth and contributes almost a fifth to the global turnover.
“We have 1200 retail stores around the world in 190 countries, none more important than India. We have set ourselves as an aspirational, accessible brand with tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. India is our fastest growing market and has a bright future,” said Prince.
In India, US Polo has a turnover to Rs 2,000 crore and it is expected to reach Rs 3,000 crore in the next few years.
“India has gained market share globally, within our footprint. We have seen great growth all over the world, but India's outpaced the rest of the market, and we see that continuing,“ the executive said.

USPA, the non-profit governing body for polo in the United States and the parent company of the retail brand, suffered a setback due to Covid but sales growth has recovered, The company, however, is not seeing any impact of the current slowdown.
“The brand was growing before COVID but we lost about 20% of the business globally, and we grew $600 million the next year. But what COVID allowed us to do, is to focus on what matters most, key partners, key markets, stores, e-commerce, the consumer. It’s much more challenging managing a $2.6 billion business than $1.3 billion, because I have to think of a 100 million dollar increment now. We see tremendous opportunity in the US and Western Europe as well,” Prince said.
The executive feels that the brand performs even better globally during a slowdown.
“And the reason is that you get this sport inspired lifestyle brand that's still affordable and accessible for consumers around the world. We are not priced at a point where we are unattainable for consumers. In 2024 we grew 10% globally, and when I look at 2025, from a global perspective, this year, starting out better 2025 than 2024 did,” the executive said.
Despite the challenging environment, the brand is looking to grow its retail presence by 15% every year.
“Even when consumption slows down, India is still fairly attractively growing at an attractive pace compared to the world. Our leadership goes across categories, and because of that, we see that in tougher times, we get stronger in some sense relative to the competition. We believe that we are poised for gaining market share in difficult times,” said Shailesh Chaturvedi, Managing Director and CEO, of
Arvind Fashions Ltd
, which sells US Polo in India.
85% of the brand's manufacturing and sourcing for
US Polo India
happens out of India and it also exports from India for other markets.
“We should look at using India as a sourcing hub. We have been very strategic in that sense having diversified sourcing around the world. But sourcing is something we have got to be looking at long term,” Prince said.
Globally, the company's next target is to reach $3 billion. Overall, the brand is adding 100 stores a year and it aims to reach 1500 over the next three to four years. Prince said that over time India has the potential to be the largest market for the brand.

Digital astrology platform Astroyogi expands to retail sector,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/digital-astrology-platform-astroyogi-expands-to-retail-sector/articleshow/118629865.cms,28-02-2025,"Digital astrology
platform
Astroyogi
on Friday announced a strategic expansion into the
retail sector
with packaged
spiritual products
, which it said was to counter a traditionally unorganised and unregulated market.
“This marks a significant step in imparting structure and reliability to an industry plagued by a surfeit of counterfeit and low-quality products,” the company said in a statement.
The range, called
Yogii by Astroyogi
, will compete in a so-far highly fragmented
astro-spiritual products
market with unverified products.
Meena Kapoor, the founder of Astroyogi, said: ""We are organising a fragmented market with products that are of quality and ethical sourcing.”
The company said it is India's second-largest
faith-tech platform
with over three million global users and services in 11 languages.
Live Events
Data platform Tracxn said in a report that astro and religious startups have surged in number to as many as 950 in the past year, with the sector also seeing increasing funding. The report attributed the surge in spiritual tech platforms to customers switching to online solutions for multiple services, which also ensure privacy and convenience.
Tracxn said the astro-tech sector has seen top-tier investors such as Peak XV Partners, Blume Ventures, Matrix Partners and Left Lane Capital, with funding in the sector increasing to $50.7 million in 2024, up from $88.5K in year 2015.
Globally too, the market is booming. A report by Allied Market Research estimated the overall astrology market to grow to $22.8 billion by year 2031, up from $12.8 billion in 2021. The growth, the report said, was on the back of a CAGR of 5.7% in this period.

India one of biggest growth markets: Ikea,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-one-of-biggest-growth-markets-ikea/articleshow/118629489.cms,06-03-2025,"India has become a key growth market for Swedish home furnishings giant
Ikea
as it continues to expand its footprint in the country. Despite a global downturn in the home furnishings sector, Ikea saw robust growth in India, with global revenues surpassing 45 billion euros in FY24, demonstrating resilience amid subdued consumer demand.
""Affordability is a key focus for us. In the last two years,
Ikea India
has lowered prices up to 16-39% in line with its global commitment and investment to pass on the benefit to the customers. This was a global move by Ikea to stay true to its affordability promise,'' Susanne Pulverer, CEO & chief sustainability officer, Ikea India told TOI in an interview.
In FY24, Ikea substantially lowered prices across 63 markets to push sales in a shrinking home furnishing market. (Ikea financial year runs from Sept 1 to Aug 31). Of the 7,000 products sold at Ikea, nearly 1,000 are priced under Rs 200, ensuring that even those with tighter budgets can find something to purchase, she added. ""We have nearly 300 million visitations (online and offline). And 30% business comes from online and it is also our fastest growing channel,'' she added
The Swedish firm, which entered the country in 2018, announced its next phase of growth on Thursday by entering north India - the country's largest
home furnishings market
. The company will start servicing north India, with start of online delivery across Delhi-NCR and nine satellite cities, including Agra, Prayagraj, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Kanpur, Lucknow, Ludhiana and Varanasi, starting March 1.
Expressing confidence in the India growth story, she said, ""We believe in India and it's a long-term investment to come to the market. Of course, the size in itself, but also where it's growing and the opportunities that we see coming in India.. We have just scratched the surface to start with these four stores and the online (business). There is so much more that we will do.""

"We were different, we need to be different again: Trent MD",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/we-were-different-we-need-to-be-different-again-trent-md/articleshow/118611500.cms,28-02-2025,"Mumbai: Tata-owned
Trent
managing director
P Venkatesalu
said the company was not perturbed by the growing competition in the retailing space and had no plan to change its strategy.
Chinese online fast fashion brand Shein re-entered the India market earlier this month almost five years after its ban through the country's leading retailer
Reliance Retail
. Since then, Trent's share has fallen by a fifth due to potential threat by Shein on its lower priced lifestyle brand
Zudio
.
""I don't think it was an easy market in the past where the competition was light and suddenly there is more competition. I think it was always very competitive, very intense. We used to be very different from where we are today, and we need to be very different from where we are today again, in the future, to be relevant, I think we should focus on the consumer,"" Venkatesalu told ET.
The retailer had one of the fastest expansion drives by any retailer in the country with value retail format Zudio, which has opened over 500 stores in the last five years. During its earnings announcement, Trent, which runs Westside and Zudio, said it will upgrade or consolidate smaller footprint stores with newer stores in more attractive micro markets.
Value retailing
where Zudio operates has seen a flurry of new competition from
Reliance
and
Shoppers Stop
to
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
over the past few quarters. In addition, demand slowdown for clothing and lifestyle products has persisted for the past two years.
Live Events
""In general, demand has been less strong in the consumer space, but it's been always non-linear, non-smooth play out. If you take any five-year period, it's been playing out with sometimes spiky positives and spiky negatives. What is more important is, if we were to look at this market 5-10 years from now, we would have seen a 10-15% CAGR, and that is something which we should be betting on as a country,"" added Venkatesalu at the Retailers Association of India's (RAI) Retail Leadership Summit.
Goldman Sachs said in a report it is re-iterating its thesis that online-only is not a scalable model in India value fashion and Zudio has the potential to gain market share with low competitive risk; Zudio has currently less than 1% overall market share that is well spread out across geographies and city tiers. ""Scale-up of any new competitor is likely to be gradual and not disruptive. Any online-only apparel retail model will have to operate at higher order values to be able to meaningfully scale,"" said the report.

"Adani to enter nearly all retail and F&B segments at airports, registers more than a dozen consumer brands",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/adani-plans-to-take-over-retail-business-at-its-airports/articleshow/118611460.cms,28-02-2025,"Mumbai: As a part of a strategy to diversify and increase the
non-aeronautical revenue
from its airport business, the
Adani Group
is entering more than two dozen retailing categories on its own hoping to cash in on a captive consumer base — over 270 million people who travel through or visit its airports annually.
It is also planning to extend the retailing business beyond airports to highways and malls in the next phase, thereby competing with global and local retailers including Domino's, Yum Brands, the
Tata Group
and
Reliance
.
The plan is to increase the contribution of non-aero businesses to about three-fourths of the revenue of
Adani Airport Holdings
Ltd from less than half now, by practically owning nearly every segment of airport retailing and food services. These segments include electronics, beauty, chocolates, alcobev, coffee, lifestyle products and food and beverages.
“Our aim in the domestic side is to take over the entire airport business and run the entire
retail operations
ourselves over a period of time as the concession gets over for existing players,” Gaurav Singh CEO of Ospree Duty Free and April Moon Retail Pvt Ltd (AMRPL), the group’s airport retail venture. “We are expanding from nearly 50 stores this year to around 310 next year, including 270 retail stores and 40 F&B outlets. Given the growth we have seen, we are exploring expansion beyond airports to highways and malls in the near future,” he said.
Adani Airport, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Adani
Enterprises Ltd, has been acquiring, developing and maintaining airport infrastructure assets. It has eight airports including seven operational — Ahmedabad, Mangaluru, Lucknow, Jaipur, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and Mumbai International Airport.
Live Events
The airport operator recorded passenger movement of 69.7 million in the nine months through December; the visitors accompanying the passengers are estimated to be more than double of that. Currently more than three-fourths of them do not shop at the airport due to limited budget-friendly options.
Apart from the airport, the company will also use the land around the airports for city-side development which will house these brands, said people privy with the development.
The city side development at these airports includes hospitality, retail, hospitals, office and entertainment facilities, with a development plan of around 19 million square feet as part of the initial phase and ramp-up subsequently.
Adani Airports recorded non-aero income of about Rs 3,681 crore in fiscal 2024. Duty-free sales accounted for 30%, followed by cargo and ground handling at 10%. Car parking, advertising, and food & beverage each contributed 7-8%.
“Next year (FY26) we're looking at roughly around a full year. Given that most of the shops are coming in the second half of the year, our revenue target is roughly around about Rs 600-odd crore (from IPs and franchisees),” Singh said.
JOINING THE BIG RETAIL LEAGUE
The move also pits Adani directly against the Tata Group and Reliance that run brands such as Starbucks, Croma and Marks & Spencers at airports.
Last year, it acquired brands such as Le Marche and Cococart, which have a presence in malls beyond airports.
The company has started the process of registering brands for its retailing business and has so far registered IPs of 15 brands ranging from bookstore brand Toyshire and Indian mithai Sweet Cart to liquor store House of Elixir and convenience store format On365 on the lines of Dollar Store. In addition, it has applied for registering a new brand for high end alcobev retailing and six new brands within quick service restaurant formats to sell tea, juice, pizzeria, rolls and Asian and global cuisine each.
According to a 2024 report by aviation consultancy firm CAPA, reviewing pricing strategies and maximising non-aero revenues can substantially increase airport profitability in India. These include considering whether aero charges align with demand and exploring greater differentiation based on factors such as time of day, passenger profile, business model, and airline frequency.
""The do-it-yourself model requires specialisation but if executed well has tremendous upside and is very profitable. By controlling retail, you could know consumers really well and that knowledge can become a critical property to ensure offerings are aligned to the right psychographics and demographics,"" said Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer at CAPA Advisory. ""While you have control of the entire airport operations, execution is the key.""

Ikea India aims to increase local sourcing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ikea-india-aims-to-increase-local-sourcing/articleshow/118608793.cms,27-02-2025,"New Delhi: Swedish furniture firm Ikea’s India unit is looking to locally source half the goods it sells in the country and open
small-format stores
in the National Capital Region before its large centres become operational in
Gurgaon
in 2026 and in
Noida
in 2028, a top executive said.
The
Ingka Group
, of which Ikea is a part, is mulling the next phase of investments in India after exhausting most of the Rs 10,500 crore for which it had got the Indian government’s approval in 2013.
“There is a plan for that (new investment) and we can talk more when we are ready,”
Ikea India
chief executive Susanne Pulverer told ET.
The company set up shop in India 2018 under the single brand retail policy of the Indian government, which requires it to locally source at least 30% of the items sold at its outlets here.
“We have an ambition to increase
local sourcing
with quality control. We also see an opportunity to work together with the industry to build up production, create jobs and export more from India. With the biggest population in the world, India should have the capacity to supply to its own market besides export,” said Pulverer.

The company is investing more than Rs 7,500 crore in developing two Ingka Centres in Gurgaon and Noida that will have office and retail space in addition to the Ikea store.
“We are looking at more stores in the North, as it is a priority market for us to further expand in different formats. We will take different initiatives to complement online, because we still believe it has to be a balance between the online and the offline,“ said Pulverer.
“Online sales is around 30% and the share may grow a little bit, but we think the physical presence will continue to be very important for the category we are in,” the executive said.

60 pc of Indian retailers see technology as key to competitiveness: PwC India Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/60-pc-of-indian-retailers-see-technology-as-key-to-competitiveness-pwc-india-report/articleshow/118603018.cms,27-02-2025,"60 per cent of brick-and-mortar retailers surveyed believe that improved access to technology can empower them to enhance their competitiveness in this evolving market, according
PwC India report
.
The influence of e-commerce and quick commerce is increasingly reshaping Indian retail, with 34 per cent of traditional retailers surveyed reporting negative impacts from online shopping.
Traditional retailers are adapting to such a transformational market change by offering credit options, free home delivery and personalised services, while also looking at
omnichannel strategies
to stay competitive.
However, our research shows that consumers want the best of both worlds--seamless digital convenience and the in-store experience.
While online shopping dominates in personal product categories like apparel and beauty (preferred by over 50 per cent of consumers), in-store purchases remain strong for family-related products such as fresh produce and home furnishings (preferred by 36 per cent), highlighting the need for tactile engagement.

Good news for shoppers! Ikea to begin online sales in Delhi-NCR this week. When is the store coming?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/good-news-for-shoppers-ikea-to-begin-online-sales-in-delhi-ncr-this-week-when-is-the-store-coming/articleshow/118598444.cms,27-02-2025,"Swedish furniture retailer Ikea, which is starting online sales in Delhi-NCR and nine other markets this week, is looking for next round of investments in India and will move to profitability after expansion, said its India CEO Susanne Pulverer. Ikea is planning to have 2 full-size stores in Delhi-NCR -- at Gurugram in 2026 and Noida in 2028.
It also plans to open physical stores in Chennai and Pune in the next phase after having operational stores in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bengaluru.
After entering these six key metro markets, Ikea will work on its next phase of journey for the country, where it will expand with smaller stores and an omni-channel strategy.
Pulverer did not specify any timeline for Pune and Chennai stores but said Ikea would be there in a couple of years. In Pune, Ikea is already available through online sales.
""The physical expansion has to complement e-commerce at Pune, and Chennai is the market we have not opened. These are together with the continuing Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Mumbai, which are in the growth phase of the next four or five years,"" Pulverer told PTI.
Live Events
Over its foray in Eastern markets as Kolkata, she said it is also an important market and Ikea would like to go there.
""We take it step by step. The logistical setup is important to open a market like in the East, and that we need to look further into. So in the third phase, we can say. But for now, it's the six markets in focus,"" she added.
In 2013, the government approved a Rs 10,500 crore FDI proposal by Ikea to set up 10 stores with allied infrastructure in 10 years.
Ingka Centres, a part of Ingka Group that operates Ikea retail, is investing one billion euros to set up two centres -- one each at Gurugram and Noida-- under the 'Lykli' brand.
""So yes, we are in dialogue (with government ). The investments which we committed are booked up with the two big investments in Noida and Gurugram,"" she added.
Ikea India in FY24 reported widening of total loss to Rs 1,299.4 crore and its revenue from operations was at Rs 1,809.8 crore, up 4.5 per cent year-on-year.
The company now aims to have a profitable growth after attaining a size.
""Every business needs to become profitable, and it's the same for Ikea in India. However, we follow the plan. So when we go into a new market, we invest heavily, we protect affordability, because we do not want to position Ikea as non-affordable, and then we take a route to profitability year on year. So in the coming years, we will move to a profitable Ikea in India as well,"" she said.
Moreover, adjusting with the high real estate prices in India, Ikea is also reducing the size of its new stores, by optimising the space utilisation. The size of stores in Gurugram and Noida will 2-2.5 lakh square feet, much smaller than Ikea's traditional large format stores.
""We came with very large size 4.6 lakh square feet stores like in Bangalore. We see that we can build the supply and the logistics in a different way, not fulfilling from the store, but a Customer Distribution Center (CDC) like here in Delhi, and we see we can optimise the space in the store to use it more wisely, and by that, also gain more lower cost,"" she said.
Currently, Ikea has large format stores at Hyderabad (4.8 lakh square feet), Navi Mumbai (5.3 lakh square feet) and Bengaluru (4.6 lakh square feet). It had also opened two small city centres in Mumbai, one of which was later closed.
""...when we look at Gurugram and Noida, we have taken the learnings and sized it a little bit less, but at the same time, have all components of the Ikea experience, food and the play area, all the parts of the home, having inspiration, having room sets, all of that we do, but on a slightly smaller size,"" she said.
Asked whether Ikea is witnessing drop in number of footfalls due to current high inflation, Pulverer said:""We see all types of customers coming. Some of them might not even buy anything. They look, they explore, they see, they might buy some food. There are some who come and buy smaller items, and there are some who buy, actually, for the whole home.""

Delhi HC orders Amazon to pay Rs 340 crore for 'Beverly Hills Polo Club' trademark infringement,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/delhi-hc-orders-amazon-to-pay-rs-340-crore-for-beverly-hills-polo-club-trademark-infringement/articleshow/118594280.cms,27-02-2025,"The
Delhi High Court
has asked
Amazon
Technologies INC. to pay Rs 340 crore in damages to
Lifestyle Equities
C.V. and Lifestyle Licensing B.V. for the infringement of the latter's registered trademark '
Beverly Hills Polo Club
'.
Amazon Technologies, which was placing products priced at 10% of Lifestyles’ product cost, was engaging in a deliberate strategy of obfuscation, pretending to wear different hats –- one as an intermediary, one as a retailer, and one as a brand owner -- all in an attempt to shift responsibility and evade liability for trademark infringement, Justice Pratibha Singh said.
“it is well known reality that all three defendants (Amazon Technologies, Cloudtail India and Amazon Seller Service) belong to the Amazon Group of Companies and operate as a cohesive commercial entity. Amazon Technologies has selectively chosen when to appear and not appear before the court,” the court noted, while permanently restraining the American e-commerce giant from selling, advertising, directly or indirectly dealing in any products or using in any manner the logo mark which was identically or deceptively similar to the Lifestyles’ trademmark.
The court said that Amazon failed to explain the exact relationship between the three defendants, but agreed to suffer a permanent injunction, thereby evading scrutiny. ""Thus, the clear attempt is to not disclose the exact relationship between the said three defendants to this court. Accordingly, in the opinion of this court, this is not a bona fide conduct of a party before the court and the conduct of the defendant clearly demonstrates that there is an intent to withhold crucial information from the court, rather than engage in bona fide conduct as expected of a party before a judicial forum,"" Justice Singh said.
Since it is a known fact that Amazon Technologies is one of the most dominant players in the e-commerce space, according to the HC, it has ways and means to use its dominant presence to promote its own products, as also products that it might otherwise wish to promote.
Live Events
Amazon Technologies also has the leverage through its own platforms to dilute the Lifestyle' brand or logo by indulging in deep discounting of its own products that compete with the latter's by using a similar mark or logo, Justice Singh said.
The Lifestyle entities while seeking permanent injunction and damages against the Amazon and related companies for infringement of their registered trademark Beverly Hills Polo Club (BHPC) had asserted their rightful ownership of the mark and claiming “extensive goodwill and recognition in the domestic and international markets.”
They said that it would be a classic case where owing to the wilful nature of the infringement, exemplary and punitive damages would be liable to be granted. Punitive damages were also required to reprimand the conduct of the defendants which run a famous e-commerce portal and were also indulging in such a flagrant violation of IP Rights, Lifestyle entities told the HC.
Lifestyle Equities C.V. had launched its products in India under the 'Beverly Hills Polo Club' trademark in 2007. The 'Beverly Hills Polo Club' word-mark is stated to have been inspired from the geographical location Beverly Hills in Los Angeles, California, an area renowned for its luxury, affluence, and association with high-end fashion and lifestyle products. The Lifestyles’ trademark consists of the word-mark 'Beverly Hills Polo Club' and the accompanying logo, the image of a 'charging polo pony, the rider and the polo stick or mallet'.

"Retail sales in India see 5% growth in January 2025, says RAI",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-sales-in-india-see-5-growth-in-january-2025-says-rai/articleshow/118578803.cms,26-02-2025,"Retailers reported a 5% growth in January 2025 compared to the same time period last year, according to
Retailers Association of India
(RAI).
“RAI’s survey shows 5% retail growth in January, led by food & grocery at 13%. QSR and CDIT grew by 6%, indicating a rise in consumer spending in these categories. The Union Budget 2025’s income tax exemption limit of Rs 12 lakh provides relief to retailers after last year’s slowdown,” said RAI CEO Kumar
Rajagopalan
.
The survey further reveals that West India experienced the highest sales growth at 7%, while North and South India each recorded a 5% increase. East India showed a growth of only 4%.
In terms of categories, Food & grocery registered the highest growth of 13%, followed by consumer durables and QSR each showing growth of 6% compared to January 2024 period last year.
“Consumer choices, however, vary widely. Retailers must adapt to these shifts, understand evolving preferences, and build the right operating model to stay competitive,” Rajagopalan said.

is reportedly planning to offer online deliveries in Delhi, Noida, and Gurugram, partnering with Germany-based Rhenus Logistics. As per a report, the service will operate from a 150,000 square foot warehouse in Gurugram and is expected to start before the company's physical stores open in the region.
Ikea's E-Commerce Push in Delhi-NCR
IKEA's online delivery service is already available in four states—Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Telangana—where the company operates stores in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Navi Mumbai. The move to expand into Delhi-NCR, a key market for IKEA, is expected to strengthen its position in India’s rapidly growing furniture market. The company's e-commerce segment is a significant part of its strategy in India, contributing about 30% of its sales.
In June 2024, IKEA partnered with Rhenus Logistics to support its online delivery expansion into Delhi-NCR, with deliveries set to begin by early 2025. Rhenus Logistics emphasised the region's potential, stating, “India is currently the world’s fourth-largest furniture market, rising rapidly from tenth place 10 years ago."" They further noted that Delhi-NCR, with its increasing demand for premium real estate in areas like Gurugram, Noida, and Delhi, is well-suited for Rhenus India’s supply chain expertise.
Ikea's Physical Store in Delhi-NCR
Alongside the online push, IKEA is preparing for its first physical stores in the Delhi-NCR region. The Gurugram store, expected to be the largest in the area, will cover 400,000 square feet and include a 1,000-seater restaurant offering both Indian and Swedish cuisines. Meanwhile, construction for a Noida store began in September 2024, with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister
Yogi Adityanath
laying the foundation stone. The Noida store is expected to open by 2028.
IKEA also secured a 12-acre plot of land in Noida for Rs 850 crore in February 2021. The site will host a nine-storey hotel, office towers, and an integrated IKEA store. The Lykli Noida development will offer a mix of retail, dining, hospitality, office space, entertainment, and cultural experiences. It is expected to attract over 25 million visitors annually.

consumer goods companies
to shrink their supply chains and timelines across functions.
Blinkit
asked
Nestle India
""if it can deliver in eight minutes, why should Nestle take two days to refill stocks"", the packaged foods company's chairman Suresh Narayanan said at its investors' and analyst call this month.
""Blinkit asks us a question saying I deliver in eight minutes, why should you take two days? Good question. So, Nestle puts its hat on, works, puts systems, puts practices and ensures that at least we get it down to one day and hopefully now we will get it down to a couple of hours,"" Narayanan said.
The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe coffee said e-commerce now contributed 9.1% to its domestic sales in the December quarter, up from 8.3% in the previous July-September quarter, with nearly 50% contribution from quick-commerce channels.
ET Bureau
Live Events
""The increasing name of the game in this country is going to be enhanced efficiency and effectiveness,"" Narayanan said on the call.
Zomato-owned Blinkit, Swiggy's Instamart, Zepto and BB Now deliver grocery and daily essentials at consumer's doorsteps within 10 minutes or less.
Quick commerce
sales have doubled for most fast-moving consumer goods companies.
""You're seeing dramatic shifts in the market.. quick commerce came out of nowhere. Would I sit on a strategy document which I wrote 24 months back and not move till I write the next strategy document? Absolutely not. Strategy is now a rolling document,"" Sunil D'Souza, managing director at salt-to-staples maker
Tata Consumer Products
(TCPL), told ET.
""We've got a board which also gives gentle nudges to the management team to make sure that we are always on point,"" D'Souza said. For TCPL, e-commerce is now contributing 15% to total turnover, with quick commerce accounting for 7.5% of that growth.
Geopolitics at play
Executives added that a volatile geopolitical scenario, too, is forcing traditional consumer companies to reduce strategy planning to shorter cycles.
Dabur
said in its December quarter earnings that with the geopolitical landscape remaining volatile in the short term, ""shrouded by uncertain macroeconomic indicators"", it is revising its strategic cycle from four to three years. The maker of Vatika shampoo and Real juice said the move was to create a more agile organisation that can quickly navigate the challenges and capture emerging opportunities.
""We have engaged McKinsey & Co to refine and align our strategies for the next three years in line with the evolving dynamics,"" Dabur chief executive Mohit Malhotra said.
Another factor, fluctuating weather, is also impacting strategies. This year, for example, the onset of summer has been earlier than other years, forcing summer-facing companies to advance production cycles.
Citing unpredictable weather, Ravi Jaipuria, chairman of RJ Corp, PepsiCo's largest bottling partner in South Asia, said the Pepsi business model is geared to adapt for agility at all times. ""Sometimes there's early summer, late monsoons, shorter winters. We have expanded enough capacity. We can never be 100% sure with exact capacity utilisation. But we are not going to be short of capacity for sure,"" he said.

M&S ropes in Manish Kapoor from Pepe to head Indian business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ms-ropes-in-manish-kapoor-from-pepe-to-head-indian-business/articleshow/118335157.cms,17-02-2025,"British retailer Marks & Spencer said it has reset its International business and strengthened its global leadership team with three new senior appointments.
Manish Kapoor
will join from Pepe Jeans as the new managing director for M&S India. Victoria Jones, formerly from Clarks, will step into the role as commercial director, international, and Richard Davies has been promoted to international partnerships director. Kapoor will join the M&S International leadership team in April. Jones and Davies are already in post.
All three will report to Mark Lemming - managing director, International, who was appointed last year as M&S announced a reset of priorities for its International business under fresh leadership.
“The reset of our International business is focussed on taking the right time and actions to build strong foundations for sustainable growth. Building an experienced global leadership team is an essential element of this plan and Manish, Victoria and Richard will play important roles, bringing fresh perspectives on our International reset and future growth strategy,"" Lemming said.
Kapoor was most recently managing director and CEO, India, at Pepe Jeans and prior to that was the chief operating officer at French Connection in India from 2012-2014, where he reset their strategy, turning it into a profitable menswear brand. His tenure at Benetton, starting in 2005, saw him grow the India business and expand the brand's footprint in South and Southeast Asia. He also launched Benetton's e-commerce vertical in India and played a pivotal role in scaling Sisley’s business in India. At M&S, Kapoor will have accountability for driving the strategic plans forward in India.

M&S, a mainstay of the UK high street, has been trying to appeal to younger shoppers globally and announced an overhaul of its stores to expand its brick and mortar presence to build a more resilient business and focus on quality merchandise. Also, companies such as Levi's, Uniqlo and Celio are increasingly getting popular for functional basics like T-shirts and jeans, unlike fast-fashion rivals that are associated with designs that move quickly from the catwalk to the showroom.
India is already its largest international market outside home in terms of store network with more than 100 stores opened in the last 15 years. M&S Reliance grew its sales by 5% during FY24 to Rs1742 crore.

"More than half of Valentine’s Day sale period orders were made on prepaid, surpassing COD: GoKwik report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/more-than-half-of-valentines-day-sale-period-orders-were-made-on-prepaid-surpassing-cod-gokwik-report/articleshow/118328440.cms,17-02-2025,"GoKwik
said prepaid orders have outnumbered
cash on delivery
(
COD
) orders for the first time ever in four years.
During the Republic Day sale this year, prepaid orders surpassed COD by 11%, and in the recent Valentine's Day sale, they accounted for 55% of total orders.
UPI remained the preferred prepaid payment mode, accounting for 46% of prepaid orders during Valentine’s sales—a 4% increase from last year. The growing acceptance of credit-based payments was also notable, with a 7% contribution, up by 3% from last year.
“We started seeing this trend during the festive season where prepaid orders increased by a significant margin yet COD continued to be the dominant preference amongst shoppers. This is a significant milestone led by UPI's increasing popularity coupled with the product interventions and offerings that we have enabled on these brands via our checkout. Along with a seamless checkout experience, offering multiple full-stack digital payment methods including credit-based options has finally started to pay off. Shopping on D2C is becoming more affordable for aspirational shoppers even in Tier 3 cities,” said Chirag Taneja, Co-Founder and CEO of GoKwik.
A shift in shopping behaviour emerged in Tier 3 cities this year. While shoppers especially here have historically leaned towards COD purchases for high-value items - this time, they purchased high-value items on prepaid, with prepaid AOV rising from 1074 to 1211 during the Valentine's sale period. Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities continued to see stronger prepaid adoption, indicating a nationwide transformation in online shopping behaviour during sale periods.

Prepaid AOV also grew by 12% during the Valentine's Day Sale period, while COD AOV remained a constant trend similar to the Republic Day sale period. Affordability blended with aspirations through credit-based options is driving this shift.
“We have closely worked with many partners to enable D2C brands to provide credit-based payment options at the checkout, something that the shoppers of today prefer. With flexible payment options, aspirations are meeting affordability increasingly, leading to a surge in prepaid purchases, and driving demand, a trend we also saw during the Republic Day sale period,” Taneja added.
Valentine's Day sale period saw a 33% surge in order volume. Beauty contributed 35% to this growth, fashion 27% and healthcare 11%. 41% of these orders came from Tier 3 cities, 31% from Tier 1 and 26% from Tier 2 cities.
The personal gifting market in India, valued at $20 billion, is growing rapidly, fueled by higher disposable incomes, increased exposure to global trends, and an expanding digital payment infrastructure. With shopping behaviours continuing to evolve, prepaid adoption is likely to gain even more traction, transforming the D2C ecosystem and redefining how consumers shop online. As prepaid becomes the preferred choice during high-traffic sale periods, D2C brands stand to gain the most from this shift, building stronger customer relationships and scaling their businesses.

"Truck makers partner with Amazon, Amul & others to develop electric commercial vehicles for last-mile deliveries",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/truck-makers-partner-with-amazon-amul-others-to-develop-electric-commercial-vehicles-for-last-mile-deliveries/articleshow/118223101.cms,14-02-2025,"India’s leading truck makers are partnering with
Amazon
, Bisleri, Blinkit and
Amul
among others for developing small
electric commercial vehicles
(
e-SCVs
) to cater to thriving demand for quick commerce and other doorstep deliveries, said company executives.
Manufacturers such as
Tata Motors
,
Ashok Leyland
and
Eicher Motors
, and even startups such as EKA Mobility and Omega Seiki, are gearing up to introduce nearly a dozen e-SCVs over the next few months to meet burgeoning logistics needs of e-commerce, cold chains for fruits, vegetables, medicines, and FMCG companies. Others like Bisleri and Amul are, for the first time, inducting customised electric vehicles to their inhouse fleets for fast tracking delivery of volumetric daily essentials like bottled water/dairy to customers.
Such vehicles, which run at a third of cost of comparative small diesel vehicles, are not only expected to usher the next phase of growth in the SCV segment but also help meet
sustainability goals
of multinationals who have firmed up targets to have zero emission fleets by 2030.
Girish Wagh, executive director at
Tata Motors
, the country’s largest commercial vehicle maker, said demand for the electric version of its best-selling SCV Tata ACE has grown by 40% in the first nine months of this fiscal year.
“We added 10 corporate customers last quarter. We have now total 70 of them and we are helping them on their decarbonisation journey,” he said, adding the company is also working with government and retail customers for providing last mile delivery solutions.
Live Events
While Tata Motors has readied for launch two more variants of the ACE to tap into the demand potential, Eicher Motors recently announced its foray into this category with the Pro X range of electric SCVs.
Vinod Aggarwal, managing director, VECV, said with the Pro X range which has been “co-created” with drivers and logistics players, the company is looking at scaling up sales of EVs for last mile deliveries to e-commerce, cold chain, parcel/courier and FMCG segments. “Last mile delivery vehicles are most relevant today for the transition to EVs. Distances covered by these vehicles are not long. Yet usage is high, which results in substantial savings for the operators,” Aggarwal said.
Eicher has a partnership with Amazon to introduce up to 1,000 zero-emission electric trucks across payload categories into the e-commerce giant’s delivery operations over the next five years, deployed through Amazon's transport service partners. Eicher also has an agreement with
ITC
for supplying 100 EVs for mid-mile transportation.
Electric SCVs are up to 50% pricier over corresponding diesel vehicles. However, given the lower operating costs—1: 3.5/4 for electric vs diesel—the benefits outweigh the cost if they run 80-90 km per day, as per industry estimates.
Unit economics itself will accelerate the shift to EVs in the last mile delivery segment, said Uday Narang, founder and chairman at Omega Seiki Mobility (OSM). Narang expects 25-30% of the 500,000 annual market for SCVs to turn entirely electric within the next five years.
“We have three types of distribution channels: for ambient, refrigerated and chilled products, which is the industry norm. EVs are increasingly being adopted for supply of dairy products from distributors to retailers,” said Jayen Mehta, managing director of India’s largest dairy company Amul, which makes packaged milk, ice-cream and butter. Amul has 20,000 such distributors nationwide.
ET Bureau
Pune-based EKA Mobility, which is preparing to roll out three small e-SCVs with payloads of 1.5 tonne, 2.5 tonne and 3.5 tonne, expects the transition to EVs to be even faster.
Sudhir Mehta, the company’s chairman said, “Initially the use cases of electric will always be the ones where usage is maximum, which is in targeted segments like this (quick commerce/e-commerce). In 3-5 years, you will see a major shift to electric for customised applications for quick commerce/e-commerce, refrigerated vans, garbage collection, all of which we are working with partners on.”
Customisation demands from consumer companies and quick commerce platforms vary from delivering large products such as geysers, heaters, air purifiers, to daily essentials like milk and water, and fragile deliveries such as Playstations, executives said.
“We are exploring customised electric vehicle solutions that strike the right balance between capital expenditure and operating costs. Discussions are underway with companies to develop solutions that optimise economies of scale while ensuring adequate carrying capacity,” said Angelo George, CEO of packaged water company Bisleri International. “The key challenges remain battery charging frequency and longevity. This space is evolving rapidly, and we would like to embrace it to stay ahead of the curve.”

GenAI could boost productivity in India’s retail industry by 35-37% in 5 yrs: EY India report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/genai-could-boost-productivity-in-indias-retail-industry-by-35-37-in-5-yrs-ey-india-report/articleshow/118207833.cms,13-02-2025,"The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) could boost
productivity
in India’s retail industry by 35-37% in the next five years, according to EY India’s latest report.
The report, titled “The AIdea of India: 2025”, highlights that 48% of Indian businesses have already initiated proof of concept (PoCs) to test GenAI solutions, while another 32% are either planning to invest or have already allocated budgets for AI adoption.
ET has reviewed the report shared by EY India.
“GenAI is transforming India's retail, consumer and e-commerce landscape by unlocking unprecedented opportunities for organisations,” said Angshuman Bhattacharya, partner, EY-Parthenon. “The trajectory of GenAI suggests that insights-driven pricing, promotions and enhanced customer experiences will be pivotal, with an anticipated productivity impact ranging from 40% to 45%. Store operations are not far behind, with expected improvements in efficiency of 38% to 40%.”
Companies in the retail industry are increasingly deploying AI-driven recommendation engines to personalise shopping experiences, optimising demand forecasting and warehouse operations to reduce errors, and leveraging AI for quality control and predictive maintenance in manufacturing.
Live Events
This shift mirrors global trends, with major international brands also embracing AI.
For instance, H&M is using GenAI for sustainable
product
development and marketing, Coca-Cola is optimising delivery routes and stock management, and Amazon Go is enabling cashier-less checkout systems.
The report suggests that in the long term, AI-driven market research, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) shopping, and fully automated manufacturing could redefine the sector, creating new business models and enhancing operational efficiency.
While the immediate benefits of GenAI include cost reduction—cited by 56% of survey respondents—and revenue growth and customer satisfaction improvements—acknowledged by 44%—the report cautions that its success will depend on balancing automation with human-centric experiences.
Bhattacharya said, “The ongoing evolution of GenAI promises to dismantle technological barriers and pave the way for greater synergy. However, maintaining a balance between automation and human-centric experiences will remain essential for GenAI’s long-term success.”

"As China dims, India begins to shine in this sector",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/as-china-dims-india-begins-to-shine-in-this-sector-luxury-market-premium-products-rado-gucci-bvlgari/articleshow/118173055.cms,12-02-2025,"Due to
China
luxury bust,
India
has emerged as the largest single-market in worldwide sales for Swiss watch maker Rado, a part of the Swatch group. ""While there are many markets that are challenged globally, the Indian market is in a good place with a positive outlook,"" Adrian Bosshard, Rado's global CEO, has told TOI recently. ""Even China is in a challenging position right now. On the other hand, we are seeing a momentum in India which is unprecedented.""
""There are other promising markets for luxury, but the size and potential are a fraction of what India might become for western luxury,"" Babin had said in an interview earlier.
Rado is one of several global luxury brands which have seen sales dip in China and now find huge promise in India. Bulgari, or Bvlgari, the Italian maker of luxury jewellery, watches, fragrances, accessories, and leather goods, is looking at India to make up for falling demand in China. Bulgari is expanding its footprint in India to take advantage of strong growth and favorable demographics, Bulgari chief executive officer Jean Christophe Babin said a few months ago in an interview with Bloomberg TV.

Rado’s biggest market is now here
Global luxury giants from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, the world's biggest luxury business, to Kering SA (the owner of
Gucci
) have seen their sales in China slump last year. India, however, with the trend of premiumisation remaining strong after the pandemic, holds potential for global luxury businesses.

Luxury+1: Will Bulgari show brands the way from China to India?
Recently, India overtook China to become the second-largest market for diamonds. This development was confirmed by Al Cook, CEO of the UK-based diamond firm De Beers Group, during an interview with Bloomberg. Cook attributed the rise to India’s robust double-digit market growth, contrasting sharply with China’s demand slump. “The good news is that India has taken over where China was, and India is now the second-largest market in the world for diamonds, and that's growing at double-digit rates,” Cook said. India has also overtaken China in consumption of high-end alcoholic drinks.
The luxury (retail) market in India is pegged at $8 billion and is expected to expand to $14 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 7%, as per analysts at BCG. It is still too small in comparison with China. But the differentiator that matters for global businesses is that India's luxury consumption is growing while in China it has hit a plateau due to various reasons.
""In terms of the depth of luxury buying, India is still more than a decade behind China but the reconstitution of consumption happening in China and the rising population of HNIs in India have definitely piqued brands' interest to pursue India in a big way,"" Anurag Mathur, partner at Bain & Company, told TOI in December.
Why China's luxury sector is dimming
In 2024, the Chinese mainland luxury market experienced a significant decline of 18%–20%, reverting to 2020 levels due to low consumer confidence and increased overseas spending, as per a report by Bain & Company. ""In many ways, this downturn marks the end of the Covid-19 artificial boost on the China luxury goods market as global tourism continues to recover. In this context, all luxury categories have underperformed, with beauty doing better and watches and jewelry performing worse. As a result, only a very small number of brands enjoyed growth in China in 2024,"" the report says.
""2025 is expected to be flat in the mainland market, with a challenging first half and an improving second half, driven by the positive impact of economic stimulus measures in China. In the longer term, the market is expected to recover at a moderate pace, driven by the solid fundamentals of China’s economy and the growth of its middle class,"" the report says.
The fall in luxury demand is part of the overall consumption slump in China. Amid China's lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out to buy luxury goods.

Besides the overall economic gloom, luxury brands in China face another growing challenge. Second-hand and grey markets for luxury goods are booming, as price hikes from luxury brands in a weak economy are prompting some shoppers to look for cheaper ways to buy them, deepening concerns for the likes of LVMH.
""The elephant in the room is that, in China, as long as price gaps (between China and other countries) exist, there is the opportunity for price sensitive consumers to go to the grey market,"" Max Piero, CEO of luxury intelligence consultancy Re-Hub, which tracks grey market luxury purchases in China, told Reuters last year.
The second-hand luxury market in China - which includes platforms such as Plum, ZZER and Alibaba-owned Xianyu - has grown at a compound annual growth rate of over 30% since 2020, according to consultancy iResearch estimates.
Why India's luxury sector is shining
Though urban consumption is down in India and rural consumption has just started recovering, demand for luxury has been on a constant upswing, especially after covid. That's why India could be a ready option for big luxury brands that see their business going down in China. And a lot of global luxury brands are already betting big on India.
As India’s economy expands, disposable incomes rise and the size of the affluent population grows, consumers are increasingly gravitating toward premium products and luxury brands. This trend, which accelerated during the pandemic, shows no signs of slowing down. From luxury cars to high-end beauty products, India’s affluent class is willing to spend on premium items that offer quality and exclusivity. This trend is also catching up in small towns where people are getting richer and are more willing to splurge on luxury.
India minted a new billionaire every five days in the last one year and took the total count of US dollar billionaires to cross the triple-century mark for the first time, as per the 2024 Hurun India Rich List which showed that India now has 334 billionaires by adding 75 compared to the last year.
Hurun India report found a total of 1,539 individuals in India with a wealth of at least Rs 1,000 crore. If Rs 5,000 crore is taken as the threshold, the rich list has 534 HNIs. ""Assuming that for every one Hurun rich lister we have found, we have probably missed two, India today likely has 5,000 individuals worth Rs 1,000 crore,"" Anas Rahman Junaid, Founder and Chief Researcher, Hurun India, said. The cumulative wealth of India's richest rose 46%, while average wealth has increased by 25%.
The list reflected the China-India gap. While China saw a 25% decline in its number of billionaires, India experienced a 29% increase.
McKinsey & Company has said in a recent report that India will be a focus for high-street fashion brands, as the players will look to Asian growth markets such as India for manufacturing. The main reason behind this phenomenon in China. The global consultancy firm said that China's economic deceleration, changing consumer preferences and the return of international travel are making growth in the country highly challenging, leading international fashion brands to look to other Asian markets.
The report added highlighting the opportunity in the luxury segment that India's population of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI), with over USD 30 million in assets, is expected to grow 50 percent from 2023 to 2028, making it the fastest-growing UHNWI population in the world. ""Aspirational customers, who make up about half of global luxury sales, are expected to grow from 60 million in 2023 to 100 million in 2027,"" it added.
In some luxury categories, India is already outperforming China. As per Simon Joseph, a senior luxury brand builder and consumer experience expert based in Zurich, India's rising affluent class is fuelling a surge in high-end spirits sales, with
Scotch whisky
and fine wines registering double-digit growth, outpacing consumption rates in the US and China. Joseph told PTI in September, ""One subcategory where India surpasses China and is growing at double the rate of the USA over a five-year CAGR is
Scotch
luxury whisky.""

sales surging 39% in value between June and November 2024 compared to the previous year. This growth far outpaced physical store sales, which rose by just 3%, according to a senior executive at market tracker NielsenIQ.
""Consumer gravitating to e-commerce is a mix of the market expanding and taking share from stores,"" Tara James Taylor, senior vice-president - global beauty & personal care at NielsenIQ, told ET.

Global and Indian brands are responding to this trend by strengthening their digital presence. Platforms like Amazon,
Myntra
, Blinkit, Zepto, Nykaa, and Reliance Retail’s
Tira
have become the go-to destinations for beauty enthusiasts. In fact,
Nykaa
reported that its beauty orders grew by 30% year-on-year in the December quarter, with 70% of those in the top 110 cities being delivered within a day. The order growth remained near flat for fashion, it said.
""Clean and sustainable beauty is a big trend, and wellness continues to be an emerging trend. Indian consumers are particularly ingredients-focused,"" Taylor said.
The surge in online beauty sales is not just about accessibility, it’s about product variety, convenience, and the influence of social media. The rise of influencers and beauty bloggers has given niche brands the chance to thrive, with Indian consumers increasingly experimenting with new formulations and international trends.
A market too big to ignore
India’s beauty and personal care market is now worth $28 billion and is set to reach $34 billion by 2028, growing at an annual rate of 10-11%. With per capita spending in this category still low, $14 in India compared to $38 in China and $313 in the US, the runway for growth is immense.

The organised offline beauty retail sector is also expanding, albeit at a slower pace. Traditional players like Shoppers Stop are making strategic moves, such as its exclusive stores for Estée Lauder’s MAC and Clinique, as well as a distribution deal with Japanese beauty giant Shiseido’s NARS Cosmetics.
While fragrances are the fastest-growing beauty category globally, India’s biggest growth is in makeup, which saw a 15.5% jump in value sales, followed by skincare at 10.5%.
Big cosmetics business and billionaire backing
With the market showing no signs of slowing down, India’s largest conglomerates are making big bets on beauty. Reliance launched Tira in 2023, marking its aggressive entry into the space, while
Tata Group
runs its beauty platform Tata Cliq Palette. Now, Ananya Birla, daughter of billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, has announced the launch of
Birla Cosmetics
, a new venture that will roll out a range of beauty and personal care products nationally in 2025.
With Ananya Birla’s entry, two of India’s most influential business families are now competing in a sector that has already attracted giants like
Hindustan Unilever
(HUL), L’Oréal, and Nykaa.
While global names like L’Oréal and Shiseido view India as a key growth market, homegrown brands are rewriting the rules. India has witnessed an explosion of direct-to-consumer (D2C) beauty startups, fuelled by e-commerce and changing consumer habits.
Many of these brands, however, are now facing challenges in scaling beyond a certain point and turning profitable. The pressure to maintain growth has led several to embrace quick commerce platforms for better reach and faster deliveries.
Consolidation has also begun, with established players acquiring niche brands that have built strong consumer loyalty. HUL, India’s largest FMCG company, recently acquired a 90.5% stake in Jaipur-based beauty brand Minimalist in a deal valuing the company at ₹2,955 crore. Known for its affordable, science-backed skincare, Minimalist gives HUL an entry into the premium segment, aligning with parent company Unilever’s global strategy to tap into high-margin beauty categories.
For HUL, beauty and personal care already contribute nearly 20% of revenue and about a third of profits. But as brands like Nykaa, Mamaearth, and L’Oréal collectively expand their market share from 33% today to a projected 42% by 2027, traditional giants may see their dominance erode. A report by Redseer Strategy Consultants and Peak XV estimates that legacy players like HUL and Procter & Gamble could lose 900 basis points of market share, falling to 58% by 2027.
E-commerce driving India's beauty boom
India’s beauty boom is also being driven by the democratisation of retail through e-commerce. With the removal of offline entry barriers and the willingness of Gen Z consumers to experiment with newer brands, many startups have found success in a market once dominated by a handful of established names.
As competition intensifies, beauty brands are racing to secure customer loyalty. Many are focusing on personalised skincare solutions, technology-driven innovations, and loyalty programmes to differentiate themselves. The industry is also seeing a push towards premiumisation, with the market for high-end beauty products expected to reach $3-3.2 billion by 2028.
With India accounting for nearly 5% of the global beauty growth opportunity, the future of the industry looks promising. The country’s beauty e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%, outpacing offline retail’s 14% growth.
The battle for market dominance will intensify, with conglomerates, startups, and international brands all competing for a share of India’s beauty wallet. And as the industry continues to evolve, one thing is certain, India’s beauty market isn’t just growing; it’s redefining itself.

India is now the fastest growing online market globally for beauty products: NielsenIQ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-is-now-the-fastest-growing-online-market-globally-for-beauty-products-nielseniq/articleshow/118153798.cms,11-02-2025,"India is now the fastest growing online market globally for beauty products, with its beauty ecommerce and quick commerce sales having grown 39% by value during June-November 2024 compared with a year earlier, far outpacing sales at physical stores that expanded 3%, a senior executive at market tracker
NielsenIQ
said.
""Consumer gravitating to ecommerce is a mix of the market expanding and taking share from stores,"" Tara James Taylor, senior vice-president - global beauty & personal care at NielsenIQ, told ET in an interview. ""The size of the pie is increasing, there's a younger age dividend, consumers are ready to spend and experiment, and the social influencer community has driven a lot of curiosity,"" she said.
According to two executives who cited data from NielsenIQ, India's beauty and personal care market has grown to $28 billion.
NielsenIQ does not specify sales data in absolute numbers. Taylor said 17% of consumers in India are now buying beauty products on ecommerce, compared with 13% a year ago. Brazil is the second fastest growing in online sales at 27%.
Sales are being driven by global luxury labels like MAC, Clinique and Dior, to mid-tier brands such as Lakme and L'Oreal and mass players like Sugar, on quick commerce and ecommerce platforms such as Amazon, Myntra, Blinkit, Zepto and independent platforms
Nykaa
and Reliance Retail's Tira.

Nykaa said in management commentary that the orders it received in the December-quarter grew 30% year-on-year for beauty but remained near flat for fashion. ""Operationally, 70% of beauty orders in the top 110 cities were delivered within the same or next day,"" Nykaa said, highlighting its emphasis on quick deliveries.
""Clean and sustainable beauty is a big trend, and wellness continues to be an emerging trend. Indian consumers are particularly ingredients focused,"" Taylor said.
According to NielsenIQ data, while fragrances is the fastest growing category globally followed by haircare, in India make-up grew the quickest at 15.5%, followed by skin-care at 10.5% in value sales.
The past two years have seen over two dozen global beauty brands entering India, industry executives said.
While fashion and beauty retailer
Shoppers Stop
has an exclusive store to sell Estee Lauder's brands MAC and Clinique, the retailer also has a distribution partnership with Japanese beauty maker Shiseido's NARS Cosmetics.

Reliance Consumer Products Ltd
(RCPL) has just launched a new sports drink, Spinner, priced at Rs 10 in India. RCPL has teamed up with a former Sri Lankan cricketer, spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, to co-create, manufacture and sell sports drinks. Spinner will compete with well-established sports drinks such as Gatorade sold by PepsiCo and Coca-Cola's Powerade which are priced much higher. Soon there will be another entrant in the sports and energy drinks category, indicating the big growth opportunity India offers. Unilever is bringing hydration drink Liquid IV, its largest global brand in the health and wellbeing business, which will compete directly with energy and sports drinks such as Logan Paul's Prime, Red Bull and Gatorade. It will target premium customers.
Where does RCPL stand with its Rs 10 sports drink in competition with premium sports and energy drinks, most of which have global brand power?

The Campa strategy
Low-price point is Ambani's favourite horse to ride into a new market. Though Reliance is launching luxury brands too to not miss the premiumisation opportunity in the Indian consumer market, Ambani's signature strategy is aiming for the mass market.
Sports drink Spinner
seems to follow the same strategy.
Two years ago, Reliance revived the iconic
Campa drink
and priced it low to force-enter India's large carbonated drinks market. Campa disrupted the market, unsettling leaders Coca-Cola and PepsiCo with its strategy of low product pricing and higher trade margins. RCPL clocked Rs 3,000 crore sales in FY24, its first full year of operations, with Campa alone contributing Rs 400 crore, ET had reported based on information from industry executives.
Live Events
Indian consumer is value-focussed and Campa's cut-throat Rs 10 pricing, higher trade commissions and PET-only bottle strategy are adversely affecting rivals, as per a report by Nuvama Institutional Equities. ""Listed beverage-FMCGs such as Dabur, Tata Consumer and Varun Beverages are feeling the heat from Campa,"" it said.
Tata Consumer Products
CEO Sunil D'Souza told analysts during its September quarter earnings call that a ""new player (Campa) coming in with a different price point disrupted the industry."" He had said selling at this price is ""not sustainable"", and the company is making a loss of Rs 1.5-2 per bottle.

Reliance's not-so-secret weapon makes Tata sound alarm as new disruption hits
""Reliance Consumer Products is replicating the strategy it began with Campa to all categories it is present in ... it is a disruptive strategy and works to incentivise the supply chain, more so for new entrants,"" a company executives had told ET a few months ago when RCPL started offering margins of 6-8% to distributors and trade partners that were nearly twice that of the industry average, to incentivise them to stock up and push its portfolio of groceries and daily essentials.
Ambani's bottom-of-the-pyramid play
Ambani's signature move is to target the mass market by becoming consumer-centric and not competition-centric. His foray into telecom, Reliance Jio, nearly a decade ago highlighted this strategy when he disrupted the market with free data and ultra low-priced handsets.
Jio's stormy entry into the telecom market riding on big freebies changed the rules of the game. Apart from free voice for life, Jio didn’t charge for data for the first six months, and later at much lower rates than rivals. As Jio quickly gathered market share, rivals scrambled for cover, and many were forced into mergers and buyouts. Jio's price disruptions continued, from the JioPhone to JioCinema Premium.
Ambani later joined hands with the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, to launch
Jio Financial Services
which too is likely to take the Indian mutual fund industry by storm by starting with the fast-growing category of low-cost passive products in true Jio style.

Reliance & HUL’s new googly set to stump another market in India
Ambani's strategy to capture the huge bottom of the consumer pyramid is based on emergence of a big consumer class out of poverty on rising disposable incomes. Ambani knows Bharat is bigger than India, and that's why his key strategy is low prices to expand quickly and into new territories. He has deployed the same strategy in his FMCG play, offering soaps and detergents at lower prices to take on big incumbents such as
Hindustan Unilever
. Eyeing the huge promise at the bottom of India's consumption pyramid where people are rising out of poverty, Ambani knows disruptive pricing is the way to achieve scale. After tasting success with Jio, he wants to disrupt the dominance of multinationals in the local consumer electronics and home appliances market with a new made-in-India brand, Wyzr.
Reliance Retail, Ambani's big mass-market enterprise after Reliance Jio, too has grown into an industry leader. It is now among the top five global retailers in terms of number of stores, and among top 30 globally in terms of revenue.
Reliance Retail
Director Isha Ambani had emphasised the bottom-of-the-pyramid strategy at the company AGM in August last year. ""Our growth is driven by our focus on smaller towns, where over two-thirds of our new stores are opening. In many of these markets, we are the first modern retailer to establish a presence,"" she said.

"China slows, India rises: Rado’s biggest market is now here",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/china-slows-india-rises-rados-biggest-market-is-now-here/articleshow/118140237.cms,11-02-2025,"India has become the largest single market for
Swiss watchmaker
Rado, part of the Swatch Group, as economic challenges in China slow luxury watch sales, ToI reported. With strong demand,
Rado
has gained a leading position in India in the $1,000-$5,000 price category (around ₹85,000-₹4,50,000).
Adrian Bosshard, Rado’s global CEO, said India’s market is performing well despite difficulties in other regions. “While there are many markets that are challenged globally, the Indian market is in a good place with a positive outlook,” ToI cited Bosshard. “Even China is in a challenging position right now. On the other hand, we are seeing a momentum in India which is unprecedented.”

The company operates around 33 stores in India, alongside sales through multi-brand retailers. Bosshard said major cities have been key contributors, but demand is growing in smaller towns. “Now, we also see healthy interest for Swiss watches from Tier 2, Tier 3, and even Tier 4 regions,” he said.
Indians are also buying
luxury watches
abroad. “People with Indian roots are buying in Dubai, Australia, UK, US and Canada. The same is true for those travelling for holidays or business, and purchasing in other countries,” Bosshard said.
Live Events
He said India’s growing luxury watch market is driven by a young population with rising disposable incomes. “There is a great momentum in India, as more and more people are passionate about luxury goods. There is a young population and a positive demography here. Also, the education levels of professionals are high and purchasing power is growing.”
Rado has been present in India since the 1950s and benefits from an established sales and service network. Bosshard said the company has consistently expanded in India, unlike some competitors that overlooked the market for years. “While we continued to expand here, there are many other brands that ignored this market for long. Also, our local management helps us develop tailor-made solutions when it comes to marketing and consumer connect initiatives,” he said.
India’s luxury watch market is booming, with soaring demand even in smaller cities. Sales of high-end brands, ranging from several lakh rupees to over ₹1 crore, have risen sharply, contrasting with slowing sales in China.
India’s growing affluent class is driving this trend, with some brands even re-entering the Indian market. The expected reduction in import duties on Swiss watches due to a trade agreement is likely to boost sales further.
Bosshard had earlier said 2024 will be a “record year” for Rado in India despite global economic challenges. Retailers such as Art of Time report that some brands have seen a 30% increase in sales.
Demand is no longer limited to big cities. Ethos Watch Boutique CEO, Pranav Saboo, said in January that sales have been rising in cities like Mangalore, Raipur, Indore, Kochi, Guwahati, and Siliguri. He attributed this to “aspirational consumption” and competitive pricing in India. Similarly, FM International Watches & Jewellery reported increasing demand in Pune, Ahmedabad, and Lucknow, with Coimbatore, Ludhiana, and Nagpur emerging as potential growth markets.

Trent bets on 'direct-to-customer' fast-fashion business model despite quick comm's meteoric rise,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/trent-bets-on-direct-to-customer-fast-fashion-business-model-despite-quick-comms-meteoric-rise/articleshow/117982489.cms,06-02-2025,"Trent Limited
has reaffirmed its commitment to its ""direct-to-customer""
fast-fashion
business model, despite the rapid growth of
quick commerce
in the retail sector.
The company, which owns popular fashion brands like
Westside
and Zudio, continues to focus on expanding its footprint, improving customer experience, and leveraging technology to drive growth.
For the third quarter of FY24, Trent reported a strong performance, with its fashion concepts experiencing high single-digit like-for-like (LFL) growth. This performance is a result of steady investments in store expansion, technology, and
supply chain management
, which have contributed to the company’s growing presence in over 201 cities, the company said after releasing its results for Q3FY24 on Thursday.
“We remain on track to strongly expand our reach and at the same time improve the quality of our store portfolio. The strong store opening program this year together with other levers keeps our growth journey on track. The value proposition of our brands continues to resonate well with customers across geographies as reflected in the encouraging results,” said Noel N. Tata, Chairman of Trent Limited.
Trent's store expansion strategy has been a key driver of growth, with over 850 ""large-box"" fashion stores now in operation, including the recent addition of 14 Westside and 62 Zudio stores, expanding the company’s footprint across 46 cities. The company also continues to optimise its store portfolio, focusing on upgrading smaller stores and consolidating them with newer ones in more attractive micro-markets.
Live Events
While Trent continues to grow its physical retail presence, it is also investing heavily in e-commerce, too.
Westside’s online platform, alongside its presence on Tata Neu, continues to see traction, with online revenues growing by 45% year-to-date, contributing over 6% to total Westside revenues. This growth complements Trent’s broader digital strategy, which aims to offer an authentic and customer-centric shopping experience.
“Our fashion portfolio continues to be differentiated by disciplines & choices. The market opportunity associated with building brands and a pure play direct-to-customer business like ours remains immense,” Tata said.
Emerging categories such as beauty and personal care, innerwear, and footwear have also contributed significantly to revenue growth, now accounting for over 20% of Trent's overall revenues.
Despite the rapid rise of quick commerce, which offers fast delivery times and convenience, Trent remains focused on building lasting relationships with customers through its curated and differentiated offerings.
This approach, coupled with their ongoing investments in technology and supply chain capabilities, is expected to continue delivering steady results for Trent.
“We continue to apply Trent’s playbook to the
Star
business and are witnessing compelling customer traction. We remain convinced that this business is well poised to shift gears and deliver substantial value to customers and shareholders over time,” said Tata.

Trent
said it will sell about 29% stake in its joint venture that runs
Massimo Dutti
in India for about Rs20.75 crore Spanish retail firm Grupo Massimo Dutti.
Post the share transfer, Trent's shareholding in the associate company will be 20%. Apart from Zara,
Trent
also has a separate association with the Inditex group to operate Massimo Dutti stores in India which saw revenues rise 14% to Rs 102 crore in FY24.
On Thursday, Trent's shares fell 8.2% on the BSE after it posted single digit same store sales growth during the December quarter with plans to optimize store portfolio. ""This involves upgrading or consolidating smaller footprint stores with newer stores in more attractive micro markets. While store expansion is a key growth lever for us, maintaining the quality and physical aesthetics of stores and ensuring consistent customer experience is equally an important objective,"" it said in a statement.
Trent's revenues rose 35% to Rs 4591 crore with a 37% increase in net profit at Rs 469 crore during the third quarter. During the December quarter, Trent opened 14 new Westside to take the total tally to 238 stores and added 62 Zudio stores to have a count of 635 doors of the mass-priced brand along with 34 stores across other lifestyle concepts as part of its portfolio.
""We remain on track to strongly expand our reach and at the same time improve the quality of our store portfolio. The strong store opening program this year together with other levers keeps our growth journey on track. The value proposition of our brands continues to resonate well with customers across geographies as reflected in the encouraging results,"" Noel N Tata, Chairman, Trent Limited said.

Earlier this week, Chinese online fast fashion brand Shein re-entered the India market almost five years after its ban through the country's leading retailer Reliance Retail. Over the past three days, Trent's share has fallen 14% due to potential threat by Shein on its lower priced lifestyle brand Zudio. Goldman Sachs, however, in a report said, it is re-iterating its thesis that online-only is not a scalable model in India value fashion.
""Zudio has potential to gain market share with low competitive risk Zudio currently less than 1% overall market share is well spread out across geographies and city tiers. Scale up of any new competitor is likely to be gradual and not disruptive. Any online-only apparel retail model will have to operate at higher order values to be able to meaningfully scale,"" said the report adding that its industry interactions indicate that a typical value retail customer has higher propensity of returns when shopping online than an average customer. ""This may lead to higher-than-industry delivery costs in online value apparel delivery.""

The great Indian beauty boom
The Indian beauty and personal care market is poised to reach $34 billion by 2028, up from $21 billion now, driven by a surge in online penetration and a growing preference for high-quality, premium beauty products, according to a report by
Nykaa
and consulting firm Redseer. The online channel, as the fastest-growing segment, is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 25%, while the organised offline channel is anticipated to grow at 14%.
The ‘Nykaa Beauty Trends Report’, released a few months ago, noted that rising discretionary spending, fuelled by increased disposable income, expanded e-commerce access, and product innovation, are some of the other key trends driving momentum in this sector. Rising aspirations and higher incomes among Indian consumers will propel the market for premium beauty, expected to reach $3-3.2 billion by 2028, it said. Further, it highlighted a notable shift in consumer demand from personal care to beauty products in India, comprising skincare, makeup, haircare and fragrance categories.
A report by Redseer Strategy Consultants and Peak XV estimated last year that India’s beauty and personal care market will expand the fastest among comparable countries by size. The compounded growth rate is projected to be 10% between 2022 and 2027, which will take the market to $30 billion. India, expected to account for nearly 5% of the global growth opportunity, has a per capita category spending of $14, lower than China ($38) and a fraction of the US ($313). That is the definition of a big opportunity. For L’Oréal SA and Shiseido, two of the world’s largest cosmetics companies, India is a key growth driver.
The beauty segment is shifting fast
India's expanding e-commerce sector has led to democratisation of the market and explosion of brands which is truer for the beauty and personal care segment. As e-commerce removed the high entry barriers which existed in offline retail and Gen Z opened up to experiment with new products as well as sought more personalised ones, India witnessed an explosion of beauty and personal care brands.

“Online platforms have become the preferred channel for purchasing luxury beauty products, with growth nearly double that of offline channels.,” Roosevelt Dsouza, head of customer success, FMCG, NielsenIQ India, has told ET. “This shift is driven by unique product offerings from small and mid-sized manufacturers, particularly on e-commerce platforms.”
The sudden growth in the number of e-commerce brands has led to new-age brands facing challenges on scaling up beyond a point or crumbling under the pressure to turn profitable. Many brands are now jumping onto the
quick commerce
-platform to tide over these challenges. However, consolidation has also begun in the sector as big brands have realised the power of personal connect with the consumer that small brands enjoy.
Recently, HUL, India’s largest FMCG company, announced the acquisition of a 90.5% stake in Jaipur-based direct-to-consumer (D2C) beauty brand Minimalist. The deal values Minimalist at a pre-money enterprise value of Rs 2,955 crore.
A leader in mass market brands, HUL is trying to capture growing demand for niche, premium beauty brands. This acquisition underscores HUL’s focus on premium, high-margin segments, aligning with parent company Unilever’s global strategy to tap into low-penetration categories. HUL has been reorganizing its beauty and personal care (BPC) division to sharpen its focus on premium offerings. Currently, this division contributes nearly a fifth of the company’s revenue and about a third of its profits. Industry executives have told ET that various brands are looking at such options, but those conversations are in early stages. India’s beauty market is becoming increasingly competitive, with focused brands like L’Oréal, Mama Earth, and Nykaa collectively holding 33% market share. This share is expected to grow to 42% by 2027, while traditional players like HUL and Procter & Gamble could see their share drop by 900 basis points to 58%, according to a report by Redseer Strategy Consultants and Peak XV Partners.

Luxury shopping expands in India's small towns as e-commerce grows,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/luxury-shopping-expands-in-indias-small-towns-as-e-commerce-grows/articleshow/117948983.cms,05-02-2025,"Smaller Indian cities are driving significant growth in luxury shopping, thanks to the increased access provided by online platforms. A report by
Tata Cliq Luxury
reveals that towns like
Botad
in Gujarat and Asansol in West Bengal are seeing a surge in purchases of high-end footwear, watches, clothing, and accessories. This trend marks a shift away from the traditional concentration of luxury shopping in major metropolitan areas like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru.
“Luxury is no longer the domain of high net-worth individuals. Customers from tier-2 and 3 towns and new geographies within the metros are driving a radical reboot of the industry,” analysts noted. The report highlights the growing influence of the ""Henry"" (high earners, not rich yet) consumer group. This segment consists of working professionals with rising incomes who are increasingly interested in luxury goods and experiences.
Tata Cliq Luxury, which generates 55% of its sales from non-metro areas such as Panchkula and Mysore, confirms this trend. “This cohort is the working population that is earning well and actively seeking out luxury experiences and goods,” said Gopal Asthana, CEO at Tata Cliq Luxury. He added, “These consumers have propelled big jumps in the sales of beauty, accessories, apparel and footwear, and their order value is comparable to those of metro consumers.” Industry experts observe that the customer base for luxury goods is evolving from established wealthy individuals to include professionals in smaller cities.
Luxury brands, including international names like Bvlgari, are embracing online platforms to reach these new markets in India. E-commerce sites like Ajio Luxe are helping brands overcome the limitations of physical store availability in smaller towns. The report also reveals rising demand for luxury items beyond fashion and jewelry, extending to categories like art, fueled in part by
social media
.
Unlike traditional luxury shoppers, these new customers are more informed and conduct research before buying. “In the digital age, they aren't willing to be mere recipients of a brand's offerings. Instead, they are leveraging knowledge - available via social media, websites and customer reviews to assess their choices,” industry experts explained. Data from Tata Cliq Luxury shows that customers typically browse six to seven brands before making a purchase, regardless of the product category.

"Shein India data to remain here, will sell products manufactured by Reliance Retail arm",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/shein-india-data-to-remain-here-will-sell-products-manufactured-by-reliance-retail-arm/articleshow/117915544.cms,04-02-2025,"The new
Shein India
app, which went live last Friday, has products which are manufactured, marketed and sold only by
Nextgen Fast Fashion
, a fully owned subsidiary of
Reliance Retail
Ventures Ltd. Nextgen manufactures these products on the
Shein
India platform through a wide network of Indian manufacturers, in which most of which are MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), according to an industry insider.
Shein has re-entered the Indian market almost five years after its ban through the country's leading retailer Reliance Retail. The new Shein Platform is built and hosted in India and its ownership and control will always remain with Reliance Retail, he said.
Shein India Fast Fashion App from Reliance Retail currently has over 10,000 downloads on Google's Play Store and is ranked among the top 10 among peers on Apple's store.
There is no equity ownership of Shein in the Indian company and app Shein India has been developed by Reliance Retail and is hosted in the country.
The newly launched platforms have no links with the now in-operational Shein app and the former website (Shein.in) which were previously managed and operated directly by Shein, he said.
Live Events
Further, the platform will be hosted on infrastructure in India and all platform data will remain in India. Shein will not have any access to, or rights, over such data, the industry insiders informed.
Reliance Retail is now working with Shein to develop a completely localised model for digitising the supply chain of Indian MSMEs and factories, creating jobs and enhancing the competitiveness of the
Indian textile sector
globally.
Moreover, Nextgen is also scaling up the network of Indian manufacturers so that India can become a supply source for Shein's global operations in future. This will also help to create substantial export opportunities for Indian MSME garment manufacturers, he said.
Shein was one of the apps that was banned by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in June 2020 after the escalation of tensions with China.
Almost three years after getting banned in India, Shein signed a partnership in 2023 with Reliance Retail, led by
Isha Ambani
, the daughter of billionaire Mukesh Ambani.
Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), through its subsidiary RRL (Reliance Retail Ltd), had entered into a technology agreement with Roadget Business Pte Ltd, which owns Shein, to develop an indigenous e-commerce retail platform.
In December last year, the government informed the Lok Sabha that the sale of branded products from Shein was not banned, though its app was blocked.
This platform is intended to create a network of local manufacturers and suppliers who will manufacture products under the brand Shein and sell them domestically and globally, Commerce & Industry Minister Piyush Goyal had said in a written reply.
The Ministry of Textiles consulted with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), which in turn consulted the Ministry of Home Affairs, and conveyed no objection to the proposal of RRVL, he added.
""The licence agreement covered the protection that ownership and control of the platform will always remain with RRVL through its wholly owned subsidiary,"" Goyal said, adding, ""As per the agreement, at all times, the platform will be hosted on infrastructure in India and all platform data will remain in India with Shein having no access to, or rights over, such data"".
The agreement requires consenting parties to follow Indian laws and ensure localisation of infrastructure and platform data, Goyal added.
Established in 2008, Shein is known for its affordable pricing and is popular among millennials for its trendy women's wear and other apparel.
It was banned, along with 59 apps, by the government citing the ""threat to sovereignty and integrity"" posed by these platforms.
However, Shein products were available in the online market through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. The issues were also brought up at the Delhi High Court.

on Feb 03, 2025)
Unicommerce Esolutions
' growth in the coming quarters will be driven by ecommerce expansion through
digital adoption
, an increase in total addressable market from complementary offerings,
client acquisition
, and an extended
product portfolio
, the ecommerce software firm’s managing director and chief executive Kapil Makhija, said on Monday.
“The long-term outlook for the Indian ecommerce market is promising, driven by increasing digital adoption and evolving consumer preferences…We will continue to enhance our offerings further as per the needs of the ecommerce ecosystem,” Makhija told analysts during a post-earnings call.
The company currently offers three product platforms: Convertway, a marketing automation platform, Uniware, an order processing platform, and Shipway, a logistics management platform. A significant portion of profits will still come from the core platform, Uniware, while the company focuses on its two newer platforms for future growth, he said.
“Uniware, our flagship platform, has been the
market leader
in its segment with a large operating scale, and demonstrates strong operating leverage driving consistent growth in our profitability. Shipway and Convertway, on the other hand, are relatively newer entrants in their respective fields and we see significant potential for growth in their scale going forward,” Makhija said.
In November, the company had announced its acquisition of Shipway. Makhija said the first tranche of the acquisition was completed on December 17, with plans to acquire the remaining stake through a merger or stock swap.
Live Events
The company has over 7,000 clients including new-age consumer brands like omnichannel eyewear retailer Lenskart, homegrown wearable and audio product brand Boat, skincare brand
Mamaearth
and online fashion retailer Myntra.
It reported a 27% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its October-December
operating revenue
to Rs 33 crore. The Gurugram-based firm’s net profit for the quarter rose 62% on-year to Rs 6 crore, as it controlled expenses under various heads.
“Our flagship platform Uniware is quite stable, requiring only minimal investment, because we invested a lot on this platform during the year FY21 and FY22. Hence, our employee expenses are not increasing in line with our revenue growth,” Makhija said on the employee benefit cost came in at Rs 12.8 crore – down 11% YoY, and 20% lower sequentially.
“With our new product also nearing maturity, we are also realigning our manpower expenses to align with appropriate investments, resulting in expanding profitability,” he added.
Unicommerce, listed on the exchanges on August 13 at a hefty premium on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) at at Rs 235 per share, more than double its issue price of Rs 108.
In FY24, Unicommerce witnessed an increase in operating revenue, which jumped by 14.4% to Rs 103 crore from Rs 90 crore in FY23. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 13 crore in FY24 compared to Rs 6 crore in the previous fiscal year.

"View: With extra money, consumers can upgrade from window shopping",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/view-with-extra-money-consumers-can-upgrade-from-window-shopping/articleshow/117867329.cms,03-02-2025,"Budget
was like a well-cooked thali-a fine balance of flavours, keeping continuity while adding a few spicy new elements to match market realities. The larger vision of Viksit Bharat remained intact, and the finance minister has been handling the economic reins well-sometimes nudging MSMEs forward, sometimes giving the middle class a well-deserved push, all the while keeping the fiscal deficit beast in check.
Booster Shot
The Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, often the underdog in budget announcements, finally got the spotlight it deserved. The credit crunch was becoming as tight as Mumbai traffic, but the finance minister stepped in, clearing the way with enhanced turnover thresholds and credit guarantees.
More Money in the Gullak!
For years, the middle-class has been stretching its monthly budget like rubber bands on a fat wallet, hoping for some relief. This time, they finally got their due-a tax break worth nearly ₹1 lakh per taxpayer. With this extra gullak money, the great Indian consumer can now happily upgrade from window shopping to actual shopping.
Slow & Steady Wins the Race

The FM continued with her slow-cooking 'dum pukht' approach-topping up successful schemes rather than introducing a full buffet of new ones. The India Post revival also made an entry, proving that sometimes, old is indeed gold. With its vast network, it can become a Swiss Army knife for logistics, banking, and e-commerce.
Move over Amazon, your friendly neighbourhood postman might just give you a run for your money! India's gig workers-
whether they are delivering your pizza or driving you home-finally got some recognition.
With over 10 million workers, this sector is the fastest growing employer.
Goodbye Red Tape
For those of us who lived through the Licence Raj, seeing compliance burdens ease is like watching the villain Amrish Puri turn a hero Rajesh Khanna. Less TDS/TCS complications, investor friendliness index, and a streamlined KYC registry-these are all steps in the right direction.
Final Takeaway-A Budget That Cares!
If past budgets were like strict parents telling us to save more, this one is more like a cool elder sibling saying, ""Here's some extra cash go have fun, but don't go overboard!"" The FM didn't just crunch numbers; she showed she understands the pain of the middle-class, the struggles of MSMEs, and the aspirations of gig workers.
So yes, this budget was like a good festival bonus-not flashy, but solid. More money in the piggy bank, more confidence in growth, and a clear message: the Indian economy is not just surviving, it's thriving!

Reliance brings Shein back to India after 2020 app ban,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-brings-shein-back-to-india-after-2020-app-ban/articleshow/117860414.cms,02-02-2025,"NEW DELHI:
Reliance Retail
has introduced Chinese
fast fashion
label Shein this weekend, almost five years after it was banned in India following diplomatic tensions between India and China. After a test launch on its fashion app Ajio for two months, Reliance has now begun selling Shein on an independent app available on AppStore and GooglePlayStore.
ET had first reported Reliance’s plans to bring Shein to India in its July 4 edition last year, and then in its December 24 edition about Reliance Retail test launching the
Chinese fashion label
in India.
Shein, now based in Singapore, is selling affordable fast fashion in India. Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd had signed a partnership with Shein two years back to sell its in India. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had said last month in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that at all times, an indigenous retail platform for Shein will be hosted with Shein having no access to, or rights over, data. He had also said that the ministry of textiles, after consultation with MeitY and the ministry of home affairs, had no objection to Reliance Retail’s proposal. Goyal had added that Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd has signed a technology agreement with Roadget Business Pte Ltd to develop an indigenous ecommerce retail platform, and stated that the platform would create a network of local manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture and sell products under the brand name Shein.
A report by consulting firm Redseer Strategy Consultants said that the Indian fast fashion market is expected to cross $50 billion in sales by FY31. The report added that the Indian fast fashion would make up for 25-30% of overall fashion retail by FY31 in the Indian market.
Shein has a presence in over 150 countries and over 250 million followers on social media, according to information on its website. The retailer reported more than $2 billion in profits for 2023 and close to $45 billion in gross merchandise value.

Ambani's Reliance fielding Chinese giant to heat up retail showdown,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/shein-app-is-here-reliance-fielding-chinese-giant-to-heat-up-retail-showdown-reliance-retail-mukesh-ambani-zudio-yousta/articleshow/117853304.cms,02-02-2025,"India’s fast fashion market is bracing for fierce competition. The soaring success of Zudio, a brand under Tata-owned Trent, has prompted
Reliance Retail
Ventures Ltd to collaborate with Chinese fashion giant
Shein
, which has gained global dominance, surpassing major fashion labels.
Reliance Retail has launched a dedicated app in India for Shein’s fashionwear under a licensing deal, nearly five years after its initial ban. According to Reuters, the app went live on Saturday without an official announcement from Reliance.

Ambani's Reliance brings Shein back to India after 2020 app ban
Reliance secured a partnership with Shein last year to reintroduce its fast fashion line in India. Shein was among the over 50 Chinese apps banned in June 2020 due to escalating India-China tensions.
Reliance
Retail had earlier initiated a backend test launch of Shein on its fashion and lifestyle platform, Ajio, marking the brand’s return to India four-and-a-half years after its government-imposed ban.
India’s Booming Fast Fashion Market
With brands like Zudio and Flipkart’s Myntra leading the segment, India’s fast fashion market is projected to surpass $50 billion in sales by FY31, according to a report by Redseer Strategy Consultants. Fast fashion is expected to account for 25-30% of India’s overall fashion retail sector by then. However, the industry remains highly fragmented, with numerous unorganized players vying for market share.
Live Events
Ambani's Chinese move to rival Tata
Ambani is leveraging Chinese-linked companies to challenge Tata in the fast fashion space. Trent Ltd., the retail arm of the $165 billion Tata Group, has seen its sales triple from pre-pandemic levels in dollar terms, while net profits have soared 12-fold. Zudio, its in-house fast fashion brand, has captivated young shoppers with trendy, affordable apparel. From just 80 stores four years ago, Zudio has expanded to nearly 560 locations across 164 Indian cities. The brand's success is driven by rapid inventory turnover in low-rent areas, allowing for high profitability despite slim margins.
In response, Ambani launched Yousta a year ago, positioning it as a direct competitor by offering all products under ₹999 ($12). However, the results have yet to materialize. Reliance Retail’s 8% year-on-year sales growth in the June quarter was primarily fueled by air-conditioners, refrigerators, TVs, and groceries, with fashion and lifestyle sales hampered by “tepid discretionary demand.”

Ambani is drawing on China-linked co's help in his battle with Tata
Shein’s Global Rise
The latest move marks a shift in Reliance’s strategy, which previously integrated brands like Superdry and Gap into its flagship Ajio platform. Now, Shein’s independent app will compete against Myntra and other fashion retailers.
Founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Chris Xu, Shein has expanded into a global fashion powerhouse, serving over 150 countries and amassing a social media following of 250 million. The brand generated more than $2 billion in profits in 2023, with its gross merchandise value nearing $45 billion.
Shein operates with a direct-to-consumer model, leveraging social media influencers and aggressive discounting to drive sales. Its portfolio includes brands like Romwe, MOTF, and Cuccoo. The company outsources manufacturing to around 5,400 third-party suppliers, mainly in China, allowing it to rapidly adjust production based on consumer demand. This efficiency has helped Shein maintain low inventory waste rates.

Inside the Chinese giant Reliance is fielding in its retail war
In September 2024, Shein became the world’s most-visited fashion and apparel website, surpassing Nike, H&M, and Zara, according to Similarweb data. Its transaction-making user base grew nearly 40% between January and August 2024, making it the fastest-growing international platform, closely followed by TikTok.
With a $66 billion valuation in 2023, Shein is now eyeing a listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Controversies Surrounding Shein’s Manufacturing Practices
Despite its rapid growth, Shein has faced criticism over its labor practices. A BBC investigation revealed that many of Shein’s factory workers log approximately 75-hour workweeks, violating Chinese labor laws. The report described relentless working conditions, with laborers stitching garments late into the night.
US political figures, including Senator Marco Rubio, have raised concerns over Shein’s alleged ties to forced labor, particularly regarding cotton sourced from China’s Xinjiang region. Amid these allegations, Shein is striving to improve its corporate reputation ahead of its IPO. The company asserts that it is investing heavily in compliance measures and fair labor standards.
Shein’s Return to India Under Strict Regulations
Reliance Retail’s
Isha Ambani
has played a crucial role in Shein’s return to India, ensuring that operations comply with local regulations. Under the agreement, Shein will act purely as a technology provider, while Reliance will retain full ownership and control over operations, including data governance.
Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal assured that all platform data would be stored in India, with no access granted to Shein. The agreement also mandates security audits by government-approved cyber experts. Additionally, Reliance plans to establish a network of local manufacturers to produce Shein-branded apparel, potentially boosting India’s textile sector and creating jobs.
Goyal clarified that while Shein-branded products were never banned in India, the app was. With its relaunch, Shein is poised to regain its foothold in the Indian market under Reliance’s watchful oversight.

Sitharaman
announced several updates in her
Budget 2025
regarding the reduction in customs duties that could make various imported goods more affordable. Here’s a quick look at how these changes will benefit consumers:
Imported Jewelry Now More Affordable
Valentine’s Day shopping just got cheaper. A DeBeers platinum ring, previously priced at Rs. 2.50 lakh, will now cost Rs. 10,000 less thanks to a 5% reduction in customs duty.
Imported Beds and Mattresses on Sale
Sweet dreams are now at a sweeter price. An imported IKEA bed and mattress set, once priced at Rs. 65,000, will now be available for Rs. 63,725 after a 2.5% cut in customs duty.
Imported MacBook Pro Prices Drop
For those bringing back a MacBook Pro from a foreign trip, a price drop is on the cards. The laptop, which used to cost Rs. 3.46 lakh, is now set to cost Rs. 3.37 lakh with a reduced customs duty rate of 35%.
Imported Motorcycles at a Better Price
Imported motorcycles are now more affordable. A Kawasaki Ninja H2 750CC, previously priced at Rs. 23 lakh, will now be Rs. 1.64 lakh cheaper due to a 10% reduction in customs duty.
Imported Sofas at Reduced Prices
Imported luxury sofas are also getting cheaper. The Couch Potato leather sofa, which once cost Rs. 6.90 lakh, will now cost Rs. 6.76 lakh after a reduction in customs duty from 25% to 20%.
Historic Memorabilia Now More Affordable
Own a piece of history for less. A Mike Tyson-signed boxing glove, which was originally priced at Rs. 22,400, will now cost Rs. 19,400 following an 18.5% reduction in customs duty on items imported for personal use.
Imported Lighting Fixtures Now Cheaper
Brighten up your home with premium lighting. A ""Lights of Scandinavia"" LED chandelier, previously costing Rs. 2.33 lakh, is now available for Rs. 2.28 lakh due to a 5% reduction in customs duty on luminaries and lighting.
Solar Panels Now More Affordable
Embrace sustainable living for less. Installing solar panels on your rooftop is now cheaper, thanks to a 4% reduction in customs duty on imported solar modules.
Imported Interactive Flat Display Panels More Expensive
On the flip side, imported interactive flat display panels will now be costlier. The customs duty on these items has increased from 10% to 20%, making them less affordable for those looking to upgrade their home or office tech.

Ambani's Reliance brings Shein back to India after 2020 app ban,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ambanis-reliance-brings-shein-back-to-india-after-2020-app-ban/articleshow/117851841.cms,02-02-2025,"Reliance Retail
has launched an app in India to sell fashionwear from China's Shein under a licensing deal, almost five years since Shein's app was banned in the country after getting caught up in a diplomatic tussle.
Reliance, owned by billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
, launched the app on Saturday morning, said a person with direct knowledge of Reliance's launch plans. The firm did not announce the launch.
Neither parent
Reliance Industries
nor Shein responded to requests for comment outside of business hours.
The
Shein India
Fast Fashion app represents a departure from Reliance's strategy of adding brands to its flagship fashion app Ajio - whose offering includes
Superdry
and Gap - as it competes with rivals such as
Myntra
from Walmart's Flipkart.
Shein, founded in China in 2012 and later headquartered in Singapore, offers a vast selection of low-priced Western clothes. Its app was banned in India in 2020 alongside other Chinese apps such as ByteDance's TikTok due to data security concerns, after a border dispute soured Indo-Chinese relations.

Last year, India's government disclosed to parliament that Reliance had entered an agreement with Shein under which Indian manufacturers would supply products under the Shein brand. It did not make any other details public.
""The fashion OG (original) is back,"" said a message displayed upon opening the app. Deliveries will initially be limited to a few cities including New Delhi and Mumbai and expanded nationwide soon, it said.
Offerings include dresses priced as low as 350 rupees ($4).
Reliance will pay a licence fee for using Shein's brand name, said the person with direct knowledge of the matter. There is no equity investment in the partnership, the person said, without elaborating on financial arrangements.
All Shein-branded products sold through the app are designed and made in India, said a second person with direct knowledge of the matter. The clothing will later be made available on Ajio, the person said, without providing a time frame.
Shein aims to list in London in the first half of the year. It ended its attempt to list in the U.S. following objections from lawmakers who questioned China's requirement for businesses to seek approval to list abroad, Reuters has reported.

Gen Z expands a new battlefield for retail giants,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/gen-z-expands-a-new-battlefield-for-retail-giants/articleshow/117732114.cms,30-01-2025,"A predominantly young population, expanding reach of social media influencers, the reels culture, and a new generation which is open to experimentation are fuelling growth in India's beauty and personal care market. Dozens of beauty brands have popped in the past few years even as global giants begin to find promise in India and Indian retail giants snap up smaller brands which pitchforked into prominence through e-commerce.
The beauty and personal care segment is also more or less immune to the widespread urban consumption slump. Consumers may cut spending on essentials but still buy their favourite beauty and personal care products.
As e-commerce democratises the beauty business, beauty and grooming products are fast filling up the online space with more than 3,500 brands, according to a
Redseer
Strategy Consultants-Nykaa report. Almost 96% of them operate primarily in the e-commerce space. “Many brands are being launched every year, enabling new consumers to enter the beauty and personal grooming category at different price points or upgrade as well,” Sharang Pant, head of commercial, tech and durables, NielsenIQ India, has told ET. “Online prices are cheaper by 10-30% versus offline for these products.”
The great Indian beauty boom
The Indian beauty and personal care market is poised to reach $34 billion by 2028, up from $21 billion now, driven by a surge in online penetration and a growing preference for high-quality, premium beauty products, according to a report by
Nykaa
and consulting firm Redseer. The online channel, as the fastest-growing segment, is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 25%, while the organised offline channel is anticipated to grow at 14%.
The ‘Nykaa Beauty Trends Report’, released a few months ago, noted that rising discretionary spending, fuelled by increased disposable income, expanded e-commerce access, and product innovation, are some of the other key trends driving momentum in this sector. Rising aspirations and higher incomes among Indian consumers will propel the market for premium beauty, expected to reach $3-3.2 billion by 2028, it said. Further, it highlighted a notable shift in consumer demand from personal care to beauty products in India, comprising skincare, makeup, haircare and fragrance categories.

How Gen Z is retouching the rules of the skincare market in India
A report by Redseer Strategy Consultants and Peak XV estimated last year that India’s beauty and personal care market will expand the fastest among comparable countries by size. The compounded growth rate is projected to be 10% between 2022 and 2027, which will take the market to $30 billion. India, expected to account for nearly 5% of the global growth opportunity, has a per capita category spending of $14, lower than China ($38) and a fraction of the US ($313). That is the definition of a big opportunity. For L’Oréal SA and Shiseido, two of the world’s largest cosmetics companies, India is a key growth driver.
Gen Z puts a gleam in beauty market
Besides the growing emphasis on self-grooming by the youth as they spend significant time on social media, putting up their photos and reels, a shift in consumer behaviour, especially driven by Gen Z, is shaping the beauty and personal care market in new ways. Companies selling cleansers, moisturisers, serums and lotions with claims of being backed by dermatologists, are now drawing a younger consumer base, especially Gen Z users who are influenced by social media celebs.
These youngsters are far more conscious of what goes on to their skin, compared to millennials and Gen X. They no longer chase basic whitening or moisturising creams. That translates to hyaluronic gel as sunscreen, kojic acid to treat dark spots and pigmentation, and snail mucin with peptide complex for smooth and moisturised skin. It is not just that they know what to buy. They have educated themselves on how each active ingredient works on their skin, even at the granular level of being aware of the exact percentage of ingredients used in products.
A key trigger for this shift has been influencers-turned-beauty gurus popularising such ware through
Instagram
and YouTube. “These ingredients may sound too chemical but consumers are now aware and seek transparency on what is being sold. In food, consumers look for protein, fat and carbs content on the pack to understand its benefits. Similarly, they want an honest approach for their skin care too,” Mohit Yadav, co-founder of
Minimalist
, which has been bought by HUL recently, told ET last year. “Even now, we are surprised by the level of knowledge consumers have compared to a few years ago when the skin care regime was much simpler,” he added.
Influencer marketing platform VHub.ai estimated last year that there are around 2,500 influencers on Instagram with more than a lakh followers, and nearly a dozen with over a million, all just talking about skincare. This number more than doubled over the past two years.
“This educational component, often delivered through relatable content and personal testimonials, has brought trust and credibility among followers, driving engagement and growth,” Sachin Modi, CEO at VHub.ai, told ET last year. There is also the quest for flawless, glass-like skin, propelled by K-beauty or Korean brands, and aided by K-pop and K-dramas.
“Earlier, there will be one shampoo, soap or cream which will come in the household, and everybody will use it,""
Varun Alagh
, co-founder of Honasa Consumer that owns personal care brand Mamaearth’s specialised skin care label The DermaCo, told ET last year. ""Even the distribution channel was family oriented where one member would shop for the whole family. Also, the brands offered were limited,” he points out. “Now, brand availability allows you to express your individuality and hence, you would find that in each of the homes there are three different samples for different needs.""
The Redseer report said micro-trends or short-duration fads of 3-6 months, especially among GenZ consumers, are also driving growth with products such as graphic eyeliners, tinted moisturisers, lip stains and colour-shift lipsticks becoming viral.
It’s the new-age brands that are really feeling the sheen as the ambassadors of this shift in consumer behaviour. Younger audiences find the relatability of new age brands higher compared to legacy players.
The beauty segment is shifting fast
India's expanding e-commerce sector has led to democratisation of the market and explosion of brands which is truer for the beauty and personal care segment. As e-commerce removed the high entry barriers which existed in offline retail and Gen Z opened up to experiment with new products as well as sought more personalised ones, India witnessed an explosion of beauty and personal care brands.
“Online platforms have become the preferred channel for purchasing luxury beauty products, with growth nearly double that of offline channels.,” Roosevelt Dsouza, head of customer success, FMCG, NielsenIQ India, has told ET. “This shift is driven by unique product offerings from small and mid-sized manufacturers, particularly on e-commerce platforms.”
The sudden growth in the number of e-commerce brands has led to new-age brands facing challenges on scaling up beyond a point or crumbling under the pressure to turn profitable. Many brands are now jumping onto the quick commerce -platform to tide over these challenges. However, consolidation has also begun in the sector as big brands have realised the power of personal connect with the consumer that small brands enjoy.
Recently, HUL, India’s largest FMCG company, announced the acquisition of a 90.5% stake in Jaipur-based direct-to-consumer (D2C) beauty brand Minimalist. The deal values Minimalist at a pre-money enterprise value of Rs 2,955 crore.
A leader in mass market brands, HUL is trying to capture growing demand for niche, premium beauty brands. This acquisition underscores HUL’s focus on premium, high-margin segments, aligning with parent company Unilever’s global strategy to tap into low-penetration categories. HUL has been reorganizing its beauty and personal care (BPC) division to sharpen its focus on premium offerings. Currently, this division contributes nearly a fifth of the company’s revenue and about a third of its profits.
Industry executives have told ET that various brands are looking at such options, but those conversations are in early stages.
India’s beauty market is becoming increasingly competitive, with focused brands like L’Oréal, Mama Earth, and Nykaa collectively holding 33% market share. This share is expected to grow to 42% by 2027, while traditional players like HUL and Procter & Gamble could see their share drop by 900 basis points to 58%, according to a report by Redseer Strategy Consultants and Peak XV Partners.
In 2023, the fast-growing market attracted India's India’s largest retailer Reliance Retail Limited, which launched its omni-channel beauty platform Tira, after the sudden rise of new-age brands Nykaa and Myntra. The
Tata Group
already has its beauty business called Tata Cliq Palette.

"Beauty and the ecommerce beast: As online breaks entry barriers, newer brands crop up, expanding offerings & market",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/beauty-and-the-ecommerce-beast-as-online-breaks-entry-barriers-newer-brands-crop-up-expanding-offerings-market/articleshow/117703587.cms,30-01-2025,"Kolkata | Mumbai: Indians are continuing to splurge on grooming, with
ecommerce
driving the boom.
The number of electronic device brands in India selling products such as hair stylers, straighteners, dryers and shavers online rose to 571 in 2024, from 399 in 2022, more than thrice the 154 sold in stores, according to market researcher
NielsenIQ
.
Beauty and
grooming products
are fast filling up the online space with more than 3,500 brands, according to a Redseer Strategy Consultants-Nykaa report. Almost 96% of them operate primarily in the ecommerce space.
“Online offers a wider assortment in the category,” said Sharang Pant, head of commercial, tech and durables, NielsenIQ India.
Live Events
Online up to 30% Cheaper
“Many brands are being launched every year, enabling new consumers to enter the beauty and personal grooming category at different price points or upgrade as well,” said Pant of NielsenIQ. “Online prices are cheaper by 10-30% versus offline for these products.”
The pace of unit or volume sales growth for electronic grooming devices online at 22% year-on-year is more than twice that in offline stores at 8.9%, showed data from NielsenIQ, which tracks actual sales.
On an already high base, the share of online sales to the total for electronic grooming products rose to 88% in 2024 from 84% in 2022, the researcher said. Industry executives peg the ecommerce market for electronic grooming products at over Rs 12,000 crore. In the beauty care segment, the online contribution has risen to 15% from 12% in the past year, according to NielsenIQ data.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd
(HUL), the country’s largest consumer goods company, pegs the total
beauty products
market at Rs 68,000 crore.
“The bedrock is wanting to look a better version of yourself,” said Harman Dhillon, executive director, beauty and wellbeing, HUL. “What ecommerce allows you to do is, it reduces the entry barriers that you had otherwise, in offline. Because it’s easier to get a product which is very, very specific and to list it, whether on your own website or to make it available is easier, versus, in the past, going in distributive trade and organised retail.”
The Redseer report said micro-trends or short-duration fads of 3-6 months, especially among GenZ consumers, are also driving growth with products such as graphic eyeliners, tinted moisturisers, lip stains and colour-shift lipsticks becoming viral.
The broader personal care segment is growing at 8.5% year-on-year, while the beauty category within that is increasing at 8.6%, NielsenIQ data showed. This is driven by premiumisation, innovative offerings, and the influence of global trends, such as the rising popularity of westernisation and South Korean beauty products and trends in India, the researcher said.
“Online platforms have become the preferred channel for purchasing luxury beauty products, with growth nearly double that of offline channels.,” said Roosevelt Dsouza, head of customer success, FMCG, NielsenIQ India. “This shift is driven by unique product offerings from small and mid-sized manufacturers, particularly on e-commerce platforms.”
The Redseer report said newer beauty care products are riding on trends popularised by influencers, pop stars and others, prompting consumers to shift from generic personal care to specific beauty products, such as the quest for “glass skin”, which first emerged in South Korea. This includes products such as sunscreen sprays and sticks, lip oil and lip tint, liquid blush, body butter, rosemary oil, salicylic acid serums and cleansers.
Shoppers Stop
,
FSN E-Commerce Ventures
(Nykaa) and others have said the beauty category is set to grow the fastest in recent earnings updates.
Nykaa
said its beauty vertical growth accelerated sequentially in the December quarter with revenue growth upwards of 25%.
Shoppers Stop chief executive officer Kavindra Mishra told analysts last week that beauty has “outgrown” overall business in the fiscal year thus far.
“With the launch of the latest version of ss.com app, our conversions have increased. In beauty, we have also launched same-day delivery from two stores. This is an experiment, and we are working on this project,” he said.

Union Budget: Cashback and tax breaks for eco-conscious shoppers?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/union-budget-cashback-and-tax-breaks-for-eco-conscious-shoppers/articleshow/117624390.cms,28-01-2025,"Budget 2025
: The retail industry in India is positioned to make a big step toward adopting eco-friendly initiatives as the world moves more and more towards sustainable practices. A greener future can be ushered in by the government introducing policies that balance sustainability and profitability in the upcoming
Union Budget
2025–2026. To accelerate the integration of sustainability into mainstream practices, the brands in the retail sector are hopeful for the following potential policy considerations.
GST Reforms in Budget Favouring Eco-Friendly Products
Currently, India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) system does not distinguish between sustainable and conventional goods. Due to their higher production costs resulting from ethical sourcing and environmentally friendly procedures, eco-friendly brands often face competitive disadvantages. The government could consider encouraging producers and customers to adopt sustainability by reviewing the GST rates for eco-friendly products. For example, reducing the GST slab for sustainable products might not only lower their costs but also motivate companies to adopt greener practices.

India Budget: Govt-Backed Cashback or Tax Incentives for Consumers
The government could also look at implementing tax breaks or reward programs for customers who buy certified environmentally friendly products in order to further promote the use of sustainable products. Policies like these could influence consumer behavior, similar to the incentives provided in sectors like electric vehicles. For example, customers purchasing products with recognized sustainability certifications could potentially benefit from a partial reimbursement of the purchase price. This would not only encourage eco-conscious choices but also raise awareness about the importance of supporting sustainable brands.

Budget: Mechanisms to Provide and Monetise Carbon Credits
By putting in a place process to earn and monetize carbon credits, businesses can not only reduce their carbon footprint but also generate additional revenue. The government can help create a simpler, more accessible pathway for these businesses, thus promoting greener practices and enhancing India’s leadership in the sustainable retail space.

Budget Expectations: Resolving GST Input Tax Credit Issues
The limitation on input tax credits under the existing GST system presents a problem for eco-friendly companies and adds to their financial burden, especially for small and mid-sized enterprises that use sustainable materials and methods. The government may give businesses investing in green practices much-needed relief by resolving these GST-related concerns. In addition to lowering costs, facilitating a more seamless flow of input tax credits, particularly between states, will enable sustainable companies to expand and increase consumer access to environmentally friendly goods. A smooth marketplace where green ideas can flourish and compete would be made possible by this action.
Budget and the Road Ahead
The government must develop workable policies in close collaboration with industry stakeholders in order to strike a balance between sustainability and profitability. To ensure effective implementation, clear guidelines , transparent timelines, and frequent evaluations are necessary. By prioritizing these initiatives in Budget 2025–2026, India has the opportunity to lead in sustainable retail, contributing to both environmental preservation and economic growth.

"E-commerce democratising growing luxe market, says Tata Cliq CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/e-commerce-democratising-growing-luxe-market-says-tata-cliq-ceo/articleshow/117605608.cms,27-01-2025,"Mumbai: The luxury market is experiencing growth with
affluent Indians
continuing to embrace
premium lifestyle offerings
, said
Tata Cliq
chief executive Gopal Asthana, citing strong revenue expansion at the company’s ecommerce platform for high-end products.
The platform,
Tata Cliq Luxury
, posted a 30% increase in revenue so far in fiscal 2025 compared with the year before, he said. As much as 55% of the platform's gross merchandise value in the ongoing financial year has come from
non-metro markets
like Jaipur, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Indore, and Nagpur, Asthana told ET on Monday.
The growth has been driven by strategic expansion into new categories. ""We've seen significant momentum across several segments, including Indie Luxe (which sells luxury goods from India) and our beauty business, particularly in fragrances. Our home and footwear divisions have also shown strong performance. The recent addition of premium brands, such as the launch of the Bvlgari boutique, has provided further impetus to our business growth,” he said.
Ecommerce has been instrumental in democratising luxury retail across India, providing access to consumers in tier-2 to tier-4 markets who previously had to travel up to 800 kilometres to reach the nearest luxury store, Asthana said. The growth is particularly driven by HENRYs (high earners not rich yet), representing a new demographic of luxury consumers beyond the traditionally affluent.
""The luxury market is no longer limited to just the wealthy,"" Asthana said. ""We're seeing strong demand from aspirational consumers who are increasingly seeking premium experiences and products like premium fragrance or sunglasses or a handbag in the range of Rs 25,000.""

A report released by Tata Cliq titled ""Thinking Beyond the Cart"" identified 13 key trends based on year-long qualitative and quantitative analysis. The findings revealed that consumers are increasingly willing to invest in products and experiences that enhance their well-being and joy. The report also emphasised that personal attention and engagement are non-negotiable elements for premium and luxury brands. While the physical retail experience remains crucial in luxury shopping, its importance has become even more pronounced in the post-pandemic era. Sustainability and genderless fashion emerged as additional significant trends identified by industry experts.
The platform recently expanded its premium offerings with the launch of TimeVallée, a luxury multi-brand boutique, and Bvlgari's first digital boutique in India. The Bvlgari boutique offers accessories, including wallets, watches, and jewelry, with premium pieces such as kada bracelets retailing for up to Rs 12 lakh.
Asthana said when luxury brands like Bvlgari list on ecommerce, they are not just looking at discovery but also actual sales. ""For a brand, it's extremely important to focus on sales. That’s why all our discussions with brands revolve around metrics like IPT (items per transaction), the number of impressions, CTRs (click-through rates) and add-to-cart actions. Some brands even request data on a weekly basis to gain deeper insights. They often compare this data with their ecommerce performance in developed markets, such as the US, to benchmark and strategise effectively.""
Asthatna grouped luxury shoppers into three categories: those who are well-informed about a product and the brand; those who have experienced luxury in certain categories but are new to others; and those who are the aspirational customers who explore the offerings, engage with the business, and consider their options carefully. “To give you some indicative numbers, our average order value (AOV), excluding smaller, incidental purchases, is over Rs 10,000. While some categories see high volumes, our AOV remains consistently between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000.""

Companies now say predicting a revival timeline is difficult as aggressive discounting strategies, including early end-of-season and
Republic Day sales
, have failed to boost demand.
With business growth remaining flat this Republic Day sales compared to last year, several companies expect a demand recovery only in the second half of 2025.
""People had bought what they wanted to buy by early December due to weddings and winter. Hence, sales in January are flat,"" said the CEO of a leading apparel brand company who requested not to be identified.

Sales of discretionary items such as apparel, footwear and beauty started slowing in 2023 after two years of pandemic-induced runway growth.
According to the Retailers Association of India (RAI), sales growth in the organised retail segments such as apparel, footwear, beauty and quick service restaurants (QSR) was in mid-single digit last calendar year, compared to 15% in 2022.
""It's not that demand is not happening in the market but the growth rate of 7% is the new normal. So, the buoyancy of demand that we saw post pandemic is missing now,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of RAI.
While sales of electronics usually peak during the Republic Day sale due to robust discounts run by the brands, there has been no major bump this year.
Electronics retail
chain Vijay Sales director Nilesh Gupta said volumes or number of units sold is flat as compared to last year and the challenges in smaller towns remain, with no pick-up in demand for entry to mid segment products. He said value sales went up by 5% due to premiumisation.
Brands said even online sales did not grow much in this year's Republic Day sales.
Republic Day and Independence Day are among the largest consumption periods in India, even though the festive season led by Diwali is the biggest.
Retail chain
Shoppers Stop
chief executive officer Kavindra Mishra said while the festive setup for Diwali was exceptional, November was slow, and December has been mixed for most of its peers.
""Inflation continues to be higher, which has tapered down in the last week.
Discretionary spending
has been lower and
consumer sentiment
, though it's better than last quarter...is nowhere near the pre-Covid or FY23 levels,"" Mishra told analysts recently. ""In informal discussion with other peer members, there was a unanimous view that the last quarter (October-December) was lower than expectations, particularly considering the slowness we had in the first two quarters,"" he added.
Chief executives have flagged multiple reasons behind the consumption slowdown - high food inflation, low salary hikes, high debt by consumers, slowdown in new job creation, increase in housing rentals and home prices, and increased spending by a section of urban consumers on holidays.
Some companies are hopeful of a reduction in income tax rates in the upcoming budget to push consumption.
Electronic company
Havells
managing director Anil Rai Gupta told analysts last week that the first six months of the fiscal saw improvement in the consumer demand, but again, around Diwali season there was some weakness.

: The rise of
quick commerce platforms
in India is altering the traditional retail landscape. According to industry reports, these platforms, including Zepto and Blinkit, have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25 percent.
Their market share in the urban grocery segment rose to 8 percent in 2023, compared to 3 percent in 2021, Anand Ramanathan, Partner and Consumer, Products and Retail Sector Leader, Deloitte, wrote in a Budget note.
Tier 2 cities have emerged as significant contributors to this growth, according to Deloitte, accounting for 30 percent of the overall sales of quick commerce platforms. This trend highlights their expanding reach beyond major metropolitan areas.
The challenges facing kiranas
Kirana stores have faced significant challenges in FY25 due to the growing preference for quick commerce platforms, particularly in metropolitan areas. The rapid expansion of quick commerce platforms has adversely affected small retailers. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) reported a 12 percent decline in revenues for kirana stores in urban areas.

Quick commerce giants leverage extensive funding, large warehouses, and expansive customer bases to offer heavy discounts, which brick-and-mortar kirana stores cannot match, the Federation of Retailers Association of India (FRAI) said.
This shift has coincided with a remarkable growth in India’s quick commerce industry, with its Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) surging from USD 0.5 billion in FY22 to USD 3.3 billion in FY24, a growth rate exceeding 280%, according to financial services firm Chryseum.
What shoppers want
The impact of this trend is evident in consumer behavior. A report by e-commerce consultancy Datum Intelligence in November highlighted that 82% of surveyed buyers shifted at least a quarter of their kirana purchases to quick commerce platforms, with 5% abandoning local stores entirely. The quick commerce market, projected to grow by USD 40 billion by 2030, has already contributed to a decline in kirana stores' market share from 95% in 2018 to 92.6% in 2023, with further reductions expected.
The concept of delivering groceries within 10 minutes has expanded to include products like healthcare items, electronics, clothing, and more. This expansion is drawing in consumers seeking convenience and speed.
The Datum Intelligence report revealed that 75% of online grocery buyers increased unplanned purchases in the last six months, with many spending over Rs 400 per order. “Nearly half (46%) of respondents report reduced spending at kirana shops, indicating a shift in customer behavior towards quick commerce platforms,” the report added.
Paresh Parekh, Partner for Consumer & Retail Sector at EY India, noted, “The rise of quick commerce in India has posed some unique challenges for traditional kirana stores by increasing competition for fast deliveries and convenience, potentially risking reduction in foot traffic.”
Technology-driven distribution models and faster fulfillment are key strategies enabling quick commerce platforms to outperform traditional stores, according to Elara Capital.
A helping hand in Budget 2025?
To foster equitable growth in India’s retail sector, Deloitte’s Ramanathan has proposed several policy recommendations to regulate quick commerce platforms. “This includes introducing compliance with FDI norms, fair trade practices and supply chain transparency,” he wrote.
These measures emphasise addressing predatory pricing, enhancing fund usage transparency, and ensuring compliance with existing legal norms. By implementing strict guidelines against predatory pricing, the market can be protected from distortions that disadvantage traditional retailers. Additionally, quick commerce platforms must be mandated to provide detailed disclosures on fund allocation, Ramanathan suggested, adding that they must also align their practices with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms to maintain transparency.
Compliance with the Competition Act, 2002, and the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) is crucial to curbing anti-competitive practices. These legal frameworks should be enforced rigorously to ensure that quick commerce platforms operate fairly. Furthermore, a comprehensive ethical code of conduct is necessary to shield small retailers, Ramanathan wrote, adding that the government must “develop an ethical code of conduct that protects small retailers, distributors and kirana stores from market distortions caused by deep discounting and other anti-competitive practices.”
In December, FRAI urged the government to launch a dedicated platform for kirana stores to enable them to compete effectively. “Such support would enable the kirana stores to remain competitive amidst the increasing encroachment into their space by quick commerce companies like Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, or Zepto,” said FRAI Honorary Spokesperson Abhay Raj Mishra.
India - a land of ‘couch potatoes’?
Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Piyush Goyal, raised concerns about the growing popularity of online shopping in India back in August 2024, cautioning that it could potentially transform the country into ""a nation of couch potatoes."" He warned that the ease of e-commerce might encourage a sedentary lifestyle, with people choosing to stay indoors, watch OTT content, and order food online instead of participating in social activities.
While recognising the role of technology in enhancing consumer convenience, Goyal emphasized the importance of a measured and structured approach to e-commerce growth, given its potential effects on traditional retail sectors and the overall economy.
Highlighting the significance of social interactions, Goyal stated, ""Going out for dinner or coffee with friends are essential for human development."" He further stressed the need to evaluate the broader implications of e-commerce on sectors like local retail stores, pharmacies, and restaurants. ""I'm not wishing away e-commerce—it's there to stay,"" he noted, urging a balanced and impartial analysis of its impact on various industries.
Budget 2025 as kiranas’ safety net
Experts believe the upcoming Budget 2025 could offer a lifeline to kirana stores. “With new technologies brought in by the government, like ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce), what is now required is a more focused approach in creating a specific solution for kirana stores that makes them as discoverable and accessible to customers, much like the way quick commerce companies are operating,” Mishra told PTI.
Suggestions for government support include incentives, simplified tax regimes, social security measures, and skilling programs. Parekh noted, “Kirana stores expect Budget 2025 to offer support including incentivizing partnering with quick-commerce platforms, say through policy etc, simplified tax and GST regime, social security and insurance, and skilling.”
India’s retail ecosystem, supported by over 30 million kirana stores and 8 crore small retailers, forms the backbone of the economy. Regulatory measures should safeguard their interests by creating mechanisms that facilitate fair competition with quick commerce platforms. Encouraging fair trade practices will help limit market concentration and promote diversity, ensuring that the retail sector remains competitive and inclusive.
As the quick commerce sector grows and reshapes consumer habits, Budget 2025 could prove pivotal in defining the future of India’s kirana stores.

IKEA nails it! 90% deliveries in India via EVs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ikea-nails-it-90-deliveries-in-india-via-evs/articleshow/117407408.cms,21-01-2025,"IKEA
, the world's biggest
furniture retailer
, has said that opting to get their power from renewable sources not just helps the planet but has also helped their wallet, after the company saved nearly ₹100 million in electricity bills alone.
The company will accelerate its investments in India to drive its broader agenda-diversify its supply chain, build partnerships for local manufacturing and grow value addition from about a third to nearly half its portfolio, said Juvencio Maeztu, Deputy Global CEO, IKEA.
In a conversation with ET's Sruthijith KK on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in
Davos
, on Monday, he said even if investments in technology and materials for achieving sustainability goals could cause a conflict between short-term profitability and long-term sustainability, in the company's experience, it has always been proven right betting on the side of sustainability.
""In India we are doing home deliveries with EV trucks. It is 90% for the country, but it is already 100% in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Pune. We are proving that it is possible to be climate friendly and reduce costs at the same time,"" said Maeztu, adding that the company has made about 30% reduction in absolute climate footprint and at the same time, grown by 23.7%. In fact, energy efficiency and investments in renewables have saved ₹97 million globally for IKEA. He added that 100% of the energy used by the company on operations in India next fiscal will come from renewable sources. Half of Ikea's workforce in India across levels are now women, he said, adding that this diversity in the workforce was something the company was really proud of.
Local sourcing will not only create more employment but also secure more affordability while large volumes will also push technology enablement in India, which still accounts for just 1.5% of global furniture export. ""That's why there is a big opportunity and IKEA is really aiming to develop much more sourcing in India. We are now in conversation with the government to align with international standards, the certification of the product,"" Maeztu, who counts a ₹100 meal with daal he once had in Amritsar as the best meal of his life. ""I can still recall how good it tasted.""
Live Events
IKEA started sourcing from India in the 1980s and has more than five dozen suppliers in the country, most of them in textiles. Over a decade ago, the erstwhile
Foreign Investment Promotion Board
(
FIPB
) had approved Ikea's Rs10,500-crore investment proposal to open 25 stores in the country by 2025. It has since opened three large-format stores in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bengaluru-each large enough to fit about four football fields-and one smaller store in Mumbai.
It aims to open bigger stores in Gurgaon and Noida soon.
India is a key market for IKEA, and the company plans to increase its investments. ""...we are not rushing for quick profit. We have come to India with a very long-term approach,"" he said.

can't disrupt India's retail sector beyond a point even though it is growing at a scorching pace. Global brokerage firm JP Morgan has recently maintained ""Overweight"" ratings on
Zomato
and
Swiggy
, the biggest quick commerce players. Mutual funds are estimated to have spent Rs 10,200 crore on buying Zomato shares in the last 3 months to make it the most bought stock in the December quarter.
Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart and Flipkart Minutes are among the top quick commerce platforms in India.
A key highlight from the JP Morgan update is the significant expansion of dark store networks. Both Blinkit (owned by Zomato) and Zepto, another big quick commerce company, have surpassed their FY25 dark store targets, with Blinkit exceeding 1,000 stores and Zepto surpassing 700 stores in the third quarter of calendar year 2024 (3QCY24). Notably, Zepto currently holds a slight lead in the total number of dark stores. The expansion trend continued into December 2024, with dark store additions primarily occurring beyond the top 3, 5, and 10 cities, indicating a strategic push to penetrate smaller markets and expand the reach of quick commerce services across India. Both Swiggy and Zomato have recently raised money from the market to fuel expansion.

Quick commerce companies quizzed by government over FDI, operating model
With growing competition within the space, the quick commerce business is expanding into ever-new territories. Major players have now forayed into services after transitioning from staples, groceries and FMCG to high-value goods.
A report by Bernstein says quick commerce is estimated to witness a 75% or more year-on-year (YoY) growth in 2025, outpacing traditional retail, which is projected to grow in the low teens. It is also expected to expand as tier-2 and smaller cities embrace this model.

How quick commerce is eroding kirana business
The rapid growth of quick commerce has taken a heavy toll on
kirana
even as e-commerce players try to battle the impact on them. Quick Commerce has captured nearly half of kirana sales.

A fast guy is pushing into omnichannel game. What can happen?
As consumer preferences shift towards the convenience of last-minute grocery deliveries, quick commerce companies are outpacing traditional retailers, with 46 per cent of consumers surveyed reporting a cut in purchases from Kirana shops, a report has said. The quick commerce market size is expected to reach USD 40 billion by 2030, a jump from USD 6.1 billion in 2024, according to the survey by Datum Intelligence conducted in October 2024.
Kirana stores, which historically dominated the Indian grocery market, are now facing an existential threat. The report showed that over 82 per cent of consumers have shifted at least one-fourth of their grocery spending from Kirana stores to quick commerce platforms.
Why quick commerce can't decimate the kirana store
Despite initial setback to kirana business due to explosive growth in quick commerce, the sector might ultimately prove to be resilient to the quick commerce onslaught. Kirana may survive the new retail war due to its unique business model.
ET has reported that consumer goods firms are reworking their channel strategies to protect neighbourhood kirana stores while also aligning them with changing shopping habits. The likes of Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Parle Products and Adani Wilmar have begun launching packs at different price points specifically for quick commerce - a trend that industry executives said will only gain traction. General trade accuses quick commerce platforms of eating into its business with predatory pricing and other unfair practices.

India's e-commerce battlefield gets ready for bloody wars
Parle has launched separate packs of popular brands like Parle-G, Hide & Seek, Krack Jack and Monaco for quick commerce, priced Rs 50-100. The small biscuit packs, priced up to Rs 30, will be available only at kiranas, as per the ET report. Large retail chains such as
Reliance
and DMart, more popular for monthly shopping, will sell packs priced Rs 120-150. ITC has launched separate quick commerce packs for brands including Engage perfume, Savlon handwash and Mangaldeep incense. The country's largest packaged edible oil company, Adani Wilmar, is going to launch a separate brand for quick commerce for both cooking oil and staples like pulses. Hindustan Unilever, the leader in the consumer goods market, has also started to roll out separate packs.
The new strategy by consumer goods firms can pose a challenge to the breathtaking growth of quick commerce. It can make it difficult for quick commerce players to expand in the bottom consumer segment which prefers to buy small packs. While quick commerce can grow on the back of high-value purchases, increasing order size and diversifying into new services and product categories, its pace of growth will be retarded in the bottom segment where kirana will continue to rule.
Moreover, quick commerce players are coming under scrutiny on the pricing factor. All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) has complained against quick commerce firms alleging that they indulged in predatory pricing and other anti-competitive practices. The complaint is now with the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Recently, a Bengaluru resident claimed a stark difference on a quick commerce platform in the prices for the same products, with iPhone users being charged significantly more than Android users. The country’s leading restaurateurs’ body may move the CCI against Zomato and Swiggy’s new standalone apps for 10-minute food delivery, ET reported based on sources a week ago. It claims the quick commerce companies are operating private labels for this service, which raises concerns for their restaurant partners.
In November last year, traders' industry body, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), released a White Paper, accusing quick commerce platforms of misusing FDI rules to dominate suppliers, control inventory and fund predatory pricing.
Kiranas are also considering their own digital avatars. Nearly 80% of kirana stores losing business share to quick commerce platforms said that it is time they focus on digitalisation to compete with them in a survey conducted by Kiko Live, a SaaS solution for neighbourhood stores. It helps kiranas build their digital storefront on ONDC Network and give their store customers an online experience. Most of the survey respondents expressed optimism about the future, believing that transitioning to online and quick commerce platforms can help businesses grow within 1-2 years.
India has about 13 million kirana stores distributing grocery and daily essentials. They remain the backbone of FMCG companies especially in rural markets and in tier-2 and -3 cities. Many believe that both online and offline channels can coexist, and quick commerce and kirana will have their separate business turfs ultimately, with kirana continuing to cater to small-value customers and segments in rural areas and small towns where business will not be worthwhile for quick commerce players.

"Weak demand, inflation weigh on retail sector:  Kavindra Mishra, Shoppers Stop MD",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/weak-demand-inflation-weigh-on-retail-sector-shoppers-stop-md/articleshow/117275352.cms,15-01-2025,"Mumbai: India's retail market remained topsy-turvy last quarter despite a robust festive season as demand slowed after Diwali amid persistent inflation, according to
Shoppers Stop
. the country's oldest department store chain.
""In an informal discussion with other peer members, there was a unanimous view that the last quarter was lower than expectations, particularly considering the slowness we had in the first two quarters (of FY25),"" Kavindra Mishra, managing director of Shoppers Stop, said during a post-earnings investor call on Wednesday.
Discretionary spending stayed subdued and consumer sentiment - though better than the previous quarter - remained below pre-Covid and FY23 levels, he said.
""Inflation continues to be higher though it has tapered down in the last week,"" Mishra said.
Shoppers Stop reported a 7% year-on-year increase in its revenue for the December quarter to ₹1,585 crore while its same-store sales grew 4%, powered by increased demand in premium segments. The premium portfolio accounted for 64% of the firm's total revenue, up from 55% two years ago-highlighting continued slowdown in the mass-market segment.
Live Events
The retail industry witnessed lower store additions and negative same-store sales growth (SSSG) in the first half of FY25, resulting in a moderation in the revenue growth, according to India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra). It attributed lower growth to a tepid consumption demand and high base effect after revenge shopping after the pandemic.
Ind-Ra, however, said a recovery is expected in the second half of FY25 and FY26, helped by improved consumer financial health with an increase in income levels and lower inflation. Higher disposable income and a spike in weddings-due to a higher number of auspicious days-would push clothing demand while favourable monsoon rains drive demand in rural areas and smaller towns, the rating agency said.
""Organised retailers' steps to rationalise stores (and) undertake controlled expansion, coupled with a focus on segments with relative outperformance such as fast fashion, luxury and ethnic fashion will support their credit profiles,"" said Adarsh Gutha, associate director, corporate ratings, at Ind-Ra. Rationalisation of non-performing stores and rightsizing stores to improve store productivity led to moderate growth in retail area of less than 9% on year in the first half of FY25 compared to around 12% growth in FY24.
""We had closed seven departmental stores and resized three department stores during the year,"" Shoppers Stop's Mishra said. ""The stores were closed as they were making losses due to multiple factors and to improve productivity also resized three stores. If we had continued to operate those stores, our growth would have been circa 10% this quarter,"" he added.

Inside the Chinese giant Reliance is fielding in its retail war,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/inside-the-chinese-giant-reliance-is-fielding-in-its-retail-war/articleshow/117207166.cms,13-01-2025,"India's fast fashion business is gearing up for intense competition. The runaway success of
Zudio
, a brand owned by a
Tata
company,
Trent
, has prompted
Reliance Retail
Ventures Ltd to tie up with a Chinese fast fashion giant,
Shein
, which has made waves across the world, overtaking major global fashion brands.
ET has reported that
Reliance
Retail has started a backend test launch of Chinese fast fashion label Shein, starting with its fashion and lifestyle platform Ajio, four-and-a-half years after the Indian government banned the label. Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd had signed a partnership with Shein last year to sell its fast fashion range in India on its platforms. The Indian government had banned the Shein app in June 2020 following escalation of India-China border conflict. Shein was among the over 50 Chinese apps banned then by the government.
Indian fast fashion market, which is dominated by brands such as Zudio and Flipkart's Myntra, is expected to cross $50 billion in sales by FY31, as per a report by consulting firm Redseer Strategy Consultants. Indian fast fashion would make up for 25-30% of overall fashion retail by FY31 in the Indian market. The market is, however, flooded with hundreds of unorganised players competing for market share.
The global rise of Shein
Founded by Chinese entrepreneur Chris Xu in 2012, Shein has since grown into a global fashion marketplace, serving customers in more than 150 countries and employing more than 11,000 people, according to its website. It has a global presence across over 150 countries and over 250 million followers on social media. The retailer clocked more than $2 billion in profits for 2023 and close to $45 billion in gross merchandise value.
Singapore-headquartered Shein's products are mostly manufactured in China. Churning out thousands of new designs a day, Shein has a direct-selling model that targets its millions of social-media followers and makes heavy use of influencers and discount codes. Known for its $10 tops and $5 biker shorts, Shein has a portfolio of 10 brands including Romwe, MOTF and Cuccoo. Shein produces clothing in China to sell online in the US, Europe and Asia excluding China. It does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and instead works with around 5,400 third-party contract manufacturers, mainly in China. It uses an on-demand manufacturing system that allows it to quickly boost production of popular items and drop products that do not sell as expected. The process helps improve production speed and inventory management. Shein says the approach has helped it consistently achieve average unsold inventory rates in the low single digits.

In September 2024, Shein reportedly became the world’s most visited fashion and apparel website, according to data from Similarweb. With a global web traffic share of 2.68% for the third quarter of 2024, Shein outpaced other major brands like Nike, H&M, and Zara, which ranked second to fourth, respectively. Shein’s user base too has seen a significant rise. Data from Earnest shows that Shein website's transaction-making users in August surged nearly 40% compared to January, marking it the fastest-growing international platform, followed closely by TikTok.
Shein was valued at about $66 billion in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The Chinese factories that drive Shein's business
A recent BBC report found that Shein's success is based on workers sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws. ""The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections. As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun. But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor,"" the BBC report said. ""We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,"" a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi, unwilling to give her name, told BBC. ""On Sundays we work around three hours less.""
In June, US President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had ""grave ethics concerns"" about Shein's ""deep ties to the People's Republic of China"": ""Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,"" he wrote.
Ahead of its listing, a major challenge Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region where it is produced through forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority.
""This is about their reputation,"" Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware, told BBC. ""If Shein can successfully achieve an
IPO
then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.""
The company told the BBC in a statement that ""Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain"" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance. It added: ""We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.""
Shein's return to India via Reliance
Mukesh Ambani's daughter, Isha Ambani, the Director of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, is playing a pivotal role in bringing Shein back to India. The return of Shein to India is subject to strict regulations to ensure full local control over operations and data.
Shein will operate solely as a technology provider, while Reliance Retail maintains full ownership and control of the platform, including all data collected from Indian customers. “The licence agreement covered the protection that ownership and control of the platform will always remain with RRVL through its wholly-owned subsidiary,” Commerce minister Piyush Goyal said in a reply in parliament last month.
Goyal added that “as per the agreement, at all times, the platform will be hosted on infrastructure in India and all platform data will remain in India with Shein having no access to, or rights over, such data.” The agreement requires consenting parties to follow Indian laws and ensure localisation of infrastructure and platform data.
“RRVL is also advised to ensure compliance with all existing laws of India and security audit of complete infrastructure can be undertaken by any government empanelled cyber security auditor,” he said. Under this agreement, the new platform will create a network of local manufacturers and suppliers who will manufacture products under the brand Shein and sell them domestically and globally. “It is expected that this will help in the growth of the Indian textiles manufacturing sector, including local handicraft and create significant employment,” said Goyal. The minister also clarified that the “sale of Shein-branded products in India was not banned,” but the app was.

Swiggy partners with Blue Tokai to deliver coffee in 15 minutes via SNACC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/swiggy-partners-with-blue-tokai-to-deliver-coffee-in-15-minutes-via-snacc/articleshow/117188125.cms,13-01-2025,"Swiggy
announced a new partnership with
Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters
to offer an array of coffee options through its ‘
SNACC
’ app. The service promises delivery to coffee aficionados within 15 minutes.
Coffee lovers can choose from a variety of
Blue Tokai
beverages, including Americano, Cappuccino, Flat White, Iced Americano, Latte, and Vietnamese Styled Iced Coffee, SWiggy said in a statement.
""This is just the beginning. We will continue to explore partnerships with brands who are committed to offer the best quality food to our customers and further build the ecosystem,” said Satheesh Raman, Business Head, SNACC.
SNACC, a standalone app launched by Bengaluru-based Swiggy, focuses on 10-minute food delivery. This marks Swiggy’s second foray into rapid food delivery following the October 2024 debut of Bolt. The
instant food delivery
sector has seen intense competition recently, with rivals like
Zomato
, Blinkit, and Zepto making significant moves.
Satheesh Raman said that in today’s fast-paced world, consumers often seek easy, quick, and non-cumbersome solutions to their daily needs. He said that after revolutionising food delivery through Swiggy and more recently Bolt, their aim is to make life even more convenient for users through SNACC. He added that their vision is to establish SNACC as the go-to destination for quick beverages, snacks, or healthy options.

“We recognize that the coffee category demands faster delivery, along with convenience and quality. Swiggy has always prioritized providing a great customer experience, and we believe that the
SNACC app
will help them cater to a diverse range of new-age customers,” said Shivam Shahi, Co-Founder and COO of Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters.

DMart's fundamental business principles should stay intact: CEO Neville Noronha,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/dmarts-fundamental-business-principles-should-stay-intact-ceo-neville-noronha/articleshow/117179834.cms,12-01-2025,"Neville Noronha
, the chief executive of
Avenue Supermarts
that operates
DMart
retail stores, said the foundational ethos and principles that have guided the company should remain unchanged, irrespective of leadership transitions.
""We operate on straightforward, fundamental business principles, and these must stay intact. While strategies and operational details might evolve, the culture of the company should never be compromised,"" he said in a chat with ET, a day after announcing his plan not to extend his contract as CEO. Noronha has spent more than two decades in the supermarket chain.
On Saturday,
Avenue Supermarts
announced that
Anshul Asawa
will replace Noronha in February 2026, after the latter chose not to continue.
""One of the many reasons I decided not to offer myself is simply, because it's been a long time. Twenty-two years is a good time,"" he said. ""I also believe that the company is in good shape with good systems and processes, high-quality and deep leadership. Someone else can do this as well as I can or even better. It's primarily smooth, easy sailing of a big ship in still waters most times.""
Asawa has been appointed CEO-designate, effective March 15, 2025. He currently serves as country head of Unilever in Thailand and general manager for its home care business unit in Greater Asia.
Live Events
""When studying great retailers that have sustained success over decades, one common thread stands out: the founding family or a major stakeholder group remains involved as custodians of the company's culture. Their presence ensures that the foundational ethos remains intact, regardless of who assumes management roles. While operational elements like product assortment and in-store strategies may shift, the underlying cultural fabric of the organisation must be preserved. The new CEO, therefore, is not here to change the company's culture but to align with it and carry it forward,"" Noronha said.
Noronha was handpicked in his twenties by the reclusive investor Radhakishan Damani to head his retail venture, DMart, in 2004. Damani spotted the young account manager with
Hindustan Unilever
, which had regular dealings with DMart, and had business interactions with him for close to two years before hiring him.
DMart surpassed the ₹50,000-crore annual turnover mark under Noronha, growing from five stores when he joined the company to 387 stores now. Within the physical retail channel, DMart has better operational metrics, such as cost to sales or invested capital, than Aldi and Lidl - the German retailers often seen as benchmarks for discount retailing - and runs some of the leanest retail operations globally. At nearly ₹36,000 per year, DMart generates almost three times the revenue per retail square foot than grocery rivals such as Reliance Fresh and Spencer's.
""Our approach might seem unconventional - we've never been guided by a grand long-term vision. Instead, our focus has been on running the company efficiently, offering meaningful products and formats to customers, and ensuring customer satisfaction with every interaction; also, making DMart an aspirational workplace for a hardworking workforce to enter management, even if they come from relatively weak economic and academic backgrounds,"" Noronha said. ""For over two decades, we have refrained from projecting where we want to be in the future. Our success has been rooted in staying customer-centric and adaptable rather than chasing a big-picture narrative.""
After over two decades, the relationship has resulted in a windfall of ₹4,700 crore for Noronha, thanks to the 1.95% stake or 12.6 million shares he holds in the company.
With an increasing proportion of Indian consumer purchases being unplanned and of low-to-moderate order value, there's been a rising demand for instant fulfilment - a space where DMart doesn't operate. This demand is currently served by quick-commerce platforms like Zepto, Swiggy Instamart and Zomato's Blinkit. For most fast-moving consumer goods companies, online channels now account for 10-12% of overall sales, with
quick commerce
making up a third of that.
Sales for
Avenue E-Commerce
, the online subsidiary started seven years ago, in fiscal 2024 stood at ₹2,899 crore, while posting a net loss of ₹185 crore, according to the latest annual report. Online business brand DMart Ready posted a loss of ₹194 crore on sales of ₹2,202 crore in FY23.

"Favre Leuba eyes India as key market for global comeback, partners with Ethos for exclusive retail",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/favre-leuba-eyes-india-as-key-market-for-global-comeback-partners-with-ethos-for-exclusive-retail/articleshow/117179746.cms,13-01-2025,"Launched in 1737, the world's second oldest watch brand Favre Leuba is making a global comeback and expects India to be its biggest market in the foreseeable future, said chairman Patrik Hoffmann in an interview with ET.
Indian luxury watch retailer
Ethos
has a stake in Favre Leuba through Grenchen headquartered Silvercity Brands and will be its exclusive retailer in the country. The previously family-owned company was hit by the quartz crisis of the 1970s and changed hands multiple times thereafter.
""The business went down following the quartz crisis and the family was forced to sell Favre Leuba. The previous owners tried to reposition the brand, but it did not work. We have the right plan in place now and are starting afresh with a new line, not with a new DNA,” said Hoffmann.
“Favre Leuba was the first
Swiss watch brand
to enter India in 1865. The brand was very well known in India and our foothold in India is key to our relaunch. It is going to help me build the brand globally,” he added.
With average price points ranging from 2200-4400 Swiss Francs, Favre Leuba will be present in 30 points of sales in India through Ethos ‘almost immediately’, said Hoffmann and he expects the number to grow steadily.

From January to November 2024, Swiss watch exports to India totalled CHF 250.1 million, up from CHF 196 million in 2023, and CHF 170.4 million in 2022. The variation from 2023 was 27.6%. Swiss watch exports to the US totalled CHF 4026 million from January to November 2024, up from CHF 3813.5 million in 2023, with a variation from 2023 of 5.6%. In China, exports during the same period totalled CHF 1902.2 million, down from CHF 2581.1 million, with a variation from 2023 of -26.3%.
A timepiece that Favre Leuba will showcase at trade show Watches and Wonders in Geneva in April is going to be in the price range of 25,000 Francs.
“Deloitte expects export sales of Swiss watches to exceed 400 million Swiss Francs by 2028 in India, but with 1.4 billion people and being the world’s fastest growing economy, and with growing maturity and sophistication of customers and a rising middle class, the outlook could get even better than what Deloitte forecasts,” said Hoffmann.
He said China does not figure in the company’s plans currently, but it is setting up distribution in markets such as Japan where the brand was well known besides Central and Eastern Europe, where the Favre Leuba was very strong.
“We are also looking at the Middle East and the UK. We will establish a presence in the US, but it will take time. The US is the biggest watch market now. I can’t neglect it,” he said.
“We showcased 22 SKUs at Geneva Watch Days last year. So, we started with 22 SKUs and with 4,000 pieces. This number is going to double in the 12-18 months. Our vision for the next 8-12 years is to manufacture about 100,000 units a year,” he added.
The downturn in the Swiss watch industry worked in favour of the brand, said Hoffmann.
“Because the doors were open to movement supplies and case supplies. The market was more open than what it would have been two years ago. It was relatively easy for us to find the right partners,” he said.
“We are working with La Joux-Perret for movements. The company produces movements for very reputable brands. We have collaborated with other luxury brands in the past and you can expect all kinds of collaborations. But, it will take some time,” he added.
When the company showcased its timepieces for the first time in Geneva Watch Days last year, there was no pushback, said Hoffmann.
“There can be pushback on models, dial executions, but there was none. That means that expectations are very high.”

Birkenstock's Covid sprint loses speed,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/birkenstocks-covid-sprint-loses-speed/articleshow/117094435.cms,09-01-2025,"German shoe manufacturer Birkenstock, which doubled its revenue every year since its launch in India about five years ago, saw its sales growth halve during 2023-24 to ₹173 crore, even as it outpaced most sports and footwear brands, albeit on a lower base.
The company's sales growth rate fell to 46% in 2023-24 compared to more than 110% in the preceding two financial years, according to regulatory filings. The firm with orthopaedic-looking footwear, with its trademark cork and latex moulded footbeds, grew in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by workplaces getting more casual and comfort becoming a priority. However, demand for most lifestyle and discretionary products slowed down over the past six to eight quarters, halting their sprint since the easing of the pandemic when retailers nearly doubled their sales in two years.
Experts said the contemporary trend of casualisation has significantly influenced consumer preferences, steering them towards a ""comfort over fashion"" approach, which is particularly evident in the surge in demand for casual footwear. This shift is underscored by the changing dynamics in the workplace, where a more relaxed dress code has emerged, allowing employees to opt for semi-formal or casual attire.
""The workplace casualisation trend has led individuals to favour versatile and comfortable casual footwear that seamlessly transitions from a professional setting to the home environment, and even social outings. This shift is not only driven by the desire for comfort, but also by the practicality of owning footwear that can serve multiple purposes across diverse settings,"" said a report by Euromonitor.
Founded in 1774 by Johann Adam Birkenstock and headquartered in Neustadt, Germany, the firm entered India in 2019 through ecommerce and a year later opened its first store at Delhi airport. Over the past four years, it has seen its revenue more than double every year as it expanded its door count to more than 40 outlets.
Live Events
In October 2023, the sandal maker went public and raised about $1.48 billion, giving Birkenstock a valuation of around $8.64 billion. The retailer received a third of the proceeds to pare debt, while the rest went to its biggest shareholder, private equity firm L Catterton, backed by French luxury fashion house LVMH.
""As we ramp up our production capacity, we will unlock the large growth potential of the APMA region, which has generated significant latent demand that we have been unable to fulfil in recent years given more limited supply. Our targeted growth strategies will build upon our growing popularity in the region's emerging markets, including China and India,"" Birkenstock had said during its initial public offering.

10-min delivery is providing a 'quick' boost to FMCG brands in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/10-min-delivery-is-providing-a-quick-boost-to-fmcg-brands-in-india/articleshow/117015186.cms,07-01-2025,"Quick commerce
has quickly gained importance for
India’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies
, offering an efficient solution to meet the growing demand for faster deliveries. With the e-commerce landscape rapidly evolving, quick
commerce
platforms have become a vital part of FMCG brands'
distribution
strategies, providing quick service and better accessibility to consumers, reported TOI.
Currently,
quick commerce platforms
account for approximately 35% of FMCG companies'
e-commerce revenue
, signaling a significant shift in the dynamics of online sales. Prominent services like Blinkit, Zepto, Instamart, and BBnow are playing a key role in connecting brands with India's digital consumers. The industry’s growth has prompted companies to hire dedicated key account managers to strengthen their partnerships with quick commerce platforms, reported TOI, citing Balasubramanian Anantha Narayanan, senior vice-president at TeamLease.
A spokesperson from
Nestle India
stated that quick commerce contributed 60% of their domestic e-commerce sales during the September 2024 quarter. ""Brands such as Kitkat, Nescafe, Maggi, and Milkmaid have been at the forefront of this channel. Across all brands,
Nestle India
has about 90-120 SKUs listed on quick commerce platforms,"" TOI quoted him as saying.
Kenvue, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in 2022, has seen notable growth thanks to
rapid delivery
services. Manish Anandani, managing director of Kenvue India, shared, ""In segments like essential health and skin health & beauty, we collaborate with India's top quick commerce platforms to make iconic brands like Stayfree, Johnson's Baby, Neutrogena, and Listerine easily accessible to consumers."" He added that quick commerce now accounts for one-third of Kenvue’s digital sales, growing twice as fast as traditional online retail channels.
ITC has similarly experienced strong growth through quick commerce. Hemant Malik, CEO of Foods and executive director at ITC Limited, remarked, ""Quick commerce has been a fast-growing area, with sales increasing 50% year-on-year and contributing half of our total e-commerce sales.""
Live Events
Quick commerce platforms also maintain larger inventories of FMCG products than traditional kirana stores. Seshu Kumar Tirumala, chief buying and merchandising officer at BigBasket's BBNow division, explained how they organise products. ""We've categorised different product types into specific use cases. For example, soaps are divided into liquid soap, bar soaps, and powders, with further distinctions like hand wash, face wash, and body wash."" FMCG products make up 60% of sales at BBNow.
While the rise of quick commerce is a challenge for traditional kirana stores, ITC has adapted with an omni-channel approach. Malik said, ""We're developing customised stock-keeping units tailored for specific channels to stay relevant.""
Despite its rapid growth, quick commerce still represents a small portion of overall FMCG sales. Satish Meena from Datum Intelligence stated, ""E-commerce accounts for less than 10% of total sales for these companies,"" noting that it plays a crucial role in addressing challenges in urban markets.
The platform also provides an opportunity for FMCG brands to reach
premium
consumers in select areas. Established national brands benefit from lower commission rates compared to newer direct-to-consumer brands. Industry sources suggest that large FMCG companies allocate around 10% of their sales to quick commerce platform advertising, while newer brands face higher promotional costs.

SC transfers Amazon-Flipkart antitrust petitions to Karnataka HC amid regulatory challenges,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/sc-transfers-amazon-flipkart-antitrust-petitions-to-karnataka-hc-amid-regulatory-challenges/articleshow/116982131.cms,06-01-2025,"The Supreme Court on Monday transferred all the petitions related to alleged anti-competitive practices by
Amazon
and Walmart's
Flipkart
e-commerce platforms to the Karnataka High Court’s single-judge bench.
A bench comprising Justices Abhay Oka and Pankaj Mithal directed the transfer of the cases after all the companies agreed to such transfer.
Karnataka HC's single bench sitting in Dharwad bench would continue to hear pending as well as the transfer petitions.
The Competition Commission of India (
CCI
) had urged the Supreme Court to transfer the petitions pending in various High Courts, either to itself or a single High Court.
The 24 petitions were filed across the High Courts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, Karnataka and Allahabad, among others. They arise out of information filed by Delhi Vyapar Sangh alleging violations of Competition Act, 2002 by Amazon and Flipkart relating to sale and purchase of mobile phones.
Live Events
The commission's investigation unit concluded in August that Amazon and Flipkart breached India's antitrust laws by favouring selected sellers on their websites. It also found that smartphone companies such as Samsung and Vivo broke those laws by colluding with the two e-commerce companies to exclusively launch products online.
The investigation is a major regulatory challenge for Amazon and Flipkart in a market where e-commerce sales are set to exceed $160 billion by 2028, up from $57 billion to $60 billion in 2023.
Since the findings, almost two dozen lawsuits across five Indian high courts have been filed by some Amazon and Flipkart vendors, as well as by Samsung and Vivo, to block the investigation as they want to ""debilitate and scuttle"" the process, the commission said earlier.
Amazon and Flipkart have faced criticism from smaller retailers for years over their business practices, saying they have suffered due to deep discounts and preferential treatment meted out by the platforms.
A Reuters investigation in 2021, based on Amazon internal documents, found the company gave preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers and used them to bypass Indian laws.
The current commission investigation started back in 2020 but has faced many delays.

Deep discounts persist across categories as brands struggle with high inventory & subdued demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/deep-discounts-persist-across-categories-as-brands-struggle-with-high-inventory-subdued-demand/articleshow/116965596.cms,06-01-2025,"Discounts have peaked in categories such as apparel, shoes and general household products while auto manufacturers are continuing the high promotional offers of December even in January and delaying the proposed price hike, with brands and retailers continuing to be saddled with high unsold inventory amidst subdued demand and delayed onset of winter.
Several brands such as H&M, Zara, Levis, Lacoste, And, Gas,
Bata
have started to offer discounts as high as 50-70%. Discounts during upcoming Republic Day sales will also be steep with some like Fab India already promoting it. Even ecommerce marketplaces are going to offer up to 80% discounts this year during their Republic Day sales expected to start mid-January, industry executives said.
Car dealers said there has been no major reduction in inventory levels as compared to December. Even electronic and household appliance manufacturers are not going for any price hike for televisions and refrigerators despite rupee’s steep depreciation against the dollar.
Department store chain Lifestyle International chief executive Devarajan Iyer said demand pressure is continuing and sentiments are not hunky dory despite discounts. “The Christmas day sale was good, but the pressure is continuing. Footfalls remain under stress and the turnaround in sentiments is happening at a very slow pace,” he said.
Live Events
Car manufacturers, who had proposed to increase prices by up to 3-4% from January, have put it on hold to clear inventory while continuing with the December discounts. The auto industry had said there has been a 10-12% increase in vehicle dispatches from factories to dealers last month, but dealers said end consumer sales have been at a slower pace.
Vinkesh Gulati, executive committee member at Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), said most of the manufacturers have not yet implemented the price hike.
“Registrations will be lower than retail sales being quoted in December by the companies. Customers will get some benefit on account of delay in price hikes. Promotional offers are likely to go up, but probably after a month,” he said.
A second auto industry executive said inventory has not corrected to the extent manufacturers wanted by year end and there are still substantial stocks in the channel.
“Promotional schemes on vehicles in stock will continue in January. These will have to be sold at the same price and with the same offers in December, as dealers need to liquidate stocks. The revised prices will be applicable on new vehicles manufactured this year, announcements to which effect are yet to be made by the manufacturers,” he said.
Consumers have been holding on to their purse strings due to continued high inflation in their daily lives while preferring to spend only for necessities. India’s goods and services tax (GST) collections rose 7.3% year-on-year in December from the year earlier, slowing from an 8.5% year-on-year increase in November, indicating consumption slowdown.
Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi said while electronic companies usually increase prices in January, this year it has been put on hold despite steep rupee depreciation since demand is not good. “We are trying to offset it with the low price of some commodities like copper,” he said.
Upper middle to high income consumers are also spending more on experiences such as multiple vacations. Demand during 2024 Diwali was marginally better compared to previous year but below expectations, whereby most brands latched on to Black Friday sales with higher discounts and started an early end of season sales last month fearing the delayed winter would increase inventory levels.

Watch it! India having a better time than China with luxury timepiece revolution,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/luxury-watch-sales-in-india-ethos-montblanc-watch-it-india-having-a-better-time-than-china-with-luxury-timepiece-revolution/articleshow/116915386.cms,03-01-2025,"India's luxury watch market is booming in 2024, defying global trends and experiencing record demand even in smaller cities, according to a ToI report. Sales are up significantly for high-end brands, costing from several lakhs to over a crore rupees. This growth contrasts with weakening sales in China, a key market for luxury goods.
Retailers and brand representatives confirm the trend. Viraal Rajan, director of Time Avenue, stated, “This growth reflects a strong recovery in consumer confidence and spending. The demand for luxury timepieces has not only returned (to pre-Covid levels) but has also expanded, showcasing a renewed appreciation for craftsmanship and heritage.” Some brands are even facing supply shortages due to the high demand.
India's growing affluent class fuels this surge, even prompting some brands to re-enter the Indian market. The upcoming reduction in import duties on Swiss watches, thanks to a trade pact, is expected to further boost sales.
The increased spending is not limited to watches. Neeraj Walia, MD & CEO of
Montblanc India
, noted, “There is a surge towards purchase of not only our writing instruments, but we are seeing an equally strong traction for watches and leather products. The average selling price is going up, and we have buyers for special editions.”
International brands are also experiencing this positive trend. Rado's Global CEO, Adrian Bosshard, said 2024 will be a ""record year"" for the brand in India despite global economic challenges. Retailers Art of Time report that some brands saw a 30% growth in sales.
Live Events
The demand extends beyond major metropolitan areas.
Ethos Watch
Boutique CEO, Pranav Saboo, highlighted rising sales in cities like Mangalore, Raipur, Indore, Kochi, Guwahati, and Siliguri. He attributes this to ""aspirational consumption"" and competitive pricing within India. Similarly, FM International Watches & Jewellery notes growing demand in Pune, Ahmedabad, and Lucknow, with Coimbatore, Ludhiana, and Nagpur emerging as potential markets. Increased access through e-commerce also contributes to this expansion.

Is the 10-minute dash becoming the way to sell in India?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/is-the-10-minute-dash-becoming-the-way-to-sell-in-india-zepto-blinkit-swiggy-ambulance-zomato-quick-commerce/articleshow/116915012.cms,03-01-2025,"Quick commerce, fuelled by the consumer need for speed and convenience, has been challenging kirana as well as organised retail as more and more people like their items delivered instantly with a click of a button. Amid rising competitive intensity in
quick commerce
with incumbents raising money to fund expansion and new and bigger players entering the sector, quick commerce is diversifying into ever new domains. Now it is shaping a challenge to the services sector. It may not be too far in future when the 10-minute delivery will become the way to sell.
Quick commerce is breaching the services sector
Zomato-owned quick-commerce platform
Blinkit
has introduced a
10-minute ambulance
service, starting in Gurugram, its chief executive Albinder Dhindsa said on Thursday. “We are taking our first step towards solving the problem of providing quick and reliable ambulance service in our cities. The first five ambulances will be on the road in Gurugram starting today,” Dhinda wrote in a post on microblogging site X. The platform plans to expand this service to all major cities within the next two years.

Blinkit rolls out 10-minute ambulance service in Gurugram
The quick commerce companies have already diversified away from groceries and staples. Blinkit had earlier launched services such as deliveries of printouts and passport-size photographs. Recently, the company forayed into the 10-minute food delivery space with a standalone app Bistro.
Zomato
’s rival
Swiggy
operates 10-minute food delivery offerings under Bolt, while quick-commerce firm
Zepto
operates Café. Meanwhile, BigBasket plans to introduce food delivery services and launch pharmaceutical deliveries in partnership with epharmacy platform Tata 1mg.
Swiggy and Zomato are testing various services to diversify beyond their core operations, sources had told ET two months ago. Swiggy is piloting a new services marketplace called 'Yello,' offering customers access to professionals such as lawyers, astrologers, dieticians, therapists, and fitness trainers. According to insiders, this initiative could potentially be hosted within the main Swiggy app or as a separate platform.
Live Events
Zomato is reportedly working on a concierge service, enabling users to place food orders over WhatsApp, assisted by human agents instead of automated chatbots. According to sources, the Gurgaon-based company has started recruiting for this service, aiming to enhance customer experience with personalized support. Zomato has also been bold in its diversification, evidenced by its acquisition of Paytm’s events and ticketing business for Rs 2,048 crore.

Zomato is also developing a handyman services platform within Blinkit, positioning itself to compete with NCR-based
Urban Company
. Last year, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal stepped down from Urban Company’s board to avoid conflicts of interest as Blinkit expands into this domain.
Quick commerce spreads to B2B
The quick delivery trend is now spreading to the B2B (business-to-business) sector. As per an ET report, B2B companies are now looking to replicate the model to service their partners and clients. Be it MyTVS doing it for automotive parts or Roca India for sanitaryware, more companies are expected to jump on the bandwagon. While the turnaround time may not be 10 minutes, it still spells a major shift in the way these companies operate.

B2Bs take a page from quick commerce playbook to speed up their operations
""We did research and pilots for six months to develop the master catalogue for the industry which means you can deliver everything from a small rubber component to the engine component,"" MyTVS managing director G Srinivasa Raghavan told ET. ""My dark store partner is now a functioning retailer and does business with zero inventory because we are delivering the inventory on demand and the same inventory extends to other garages or retailers who are ordering."" Others such as sanitaryware major Roca India are also finding new ways to integrate their supplier network better. The company that owns the Parryware brand has more than 46 customer care centres which are constantly monitored for adequate stock, and spare parts are sent routinely to the franchise network.
The ET report quoted business and brand strategist Harish Bijoor as saying that quick delivery could become a distinguishing factor even in the B2B space where companies that service faster and efficiently might derive an edge over others.
Differentiation fuels quick commerce
Swiggy's impressive IPO recently pointed at the incoming deluge of cash in the quick commerce business. Shortly after the Swiggy IPO, Zomato raised Rs 8,500 crore via QIP which will support Blinkit expansion, dark stores and marketing. Zeepto, another quick commerce player, is also raising money ET has reported. These top three players in the sector with over 85% market share putting more money into business means more intense competition.
Sensing a rising threat from quick commerce, the biggest e-commerce players, Flipkart and Amazon, too have jumped on to the quick commerce bandwagon. Amazon India is racing to launch its quick commerce delivery service, Tez.

Investors queue up for more quick commerce startups with special focus
Flipkart — Amazon’s arch-rival in India — launched its quick service, Minutes, before the start of festive season sales during September-October last year and has since scaled the service in major cities. Also in the fray is Tata-owned BigBasket, which has made a shift to the quick model. Meanwhile, Tata Digital — which runs Tata Neu — has also rolled out its own quick commerce service Neu Flash. There are reports that Mukesh Ambani's Reliance too is eying quick commerce for its consumer business.
With rising competition and so many big players in the sector, differentiation becomes key to success. That's why quick commerce players are diversifying from groceries, staples and small consumer goods to food, white goods and now services too. With the spread of quick commerce across domains and sectors, it might emerge as the way to sell in India. ET has reported that specialised quick commerce models, such as for fashion, food and pharmacy, are emerging as new hotspots, with at least half a dozen ventures primed to raise capital. Startups enabling quick commerce deliveries are also closing deals, people in the know said. Several executives who have exited internet firms are planning ventures under new verticals within India’s most vibrant ecommerce sector.

Blinkit launches 10-minute ambulance service in Gurugram,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/blinkit-launches-10-minute-ambulance-service-in-gurugram/articleshow/116887914.cms,02-01-2025,"Quick commerce platform
Blinkit
has introduced a 10-minute ambulance service in select areas of Gurugram as part of a pilot project. Users can now access the option to book an ambulance directly through the Blinkit app, the company announced.
According to Blinkit's statement, the ambulances are equipped with essential life-saving equipment, including oxygen cylinders, automated external defibrillators (AED), stretchers, monitors, suction machines, and emergency medicines. Additionally, they feature a scoop stretcher and a wheelchair to ensure the safe transport of patients.
Each ambulance is staffed with a paramedic, a duty assistant, and a trained driver to deliver timely and reliable care.
“This is our first step toward addressing the challenge of providing quick and reliable ambulance services in urban areas. The initial fleet of five ambulances will operate in Gurugram starting today,” Blinkit CEO
Albinder Dhindsa

10-minute deliveries: Can't miss profit and regulatory hurdles to add profit in big basket,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/10-minute-deliveries-cant-miss-profit-and-regulatory-hurdles-to-add-profit-in-big-basket/articleshow/116853691.cms,01-01-2025,"Indians embraced
quick commerce platforms
in 2024, using them to buy everything from breakfast staples like milk and eggs to midnight snacks like noodles and chips. Many even purchased gadgets like the iPhone 16 through these platforms. This trend of
10-minute deliveries
is set to grow in 2025 as companies expand their offerings and cater to increasing demands, particularly in major metropolitan areas. People in these cities are willing to pay extra for the convenience of fast doorstep delivery.
Quick commerce platforms have already moved beyond groceries, now delivering electronics, small kitchen appliances, and more. Analysts predict this shift will continue, with purchases of these items increasingly shifting online. “Average order values (AOVs) have grown from Rs 300-350 to Rs 450-600,” said
Shivaraj Jayakumar
of Praxis Global Alliance. Some platforms, like
Zepto
, are even experimenting with delivering freshly prepared food in 10 minutes through dedicated apps.
For fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, around 30% of their online sales have shifted to quick commerce platforms. “From the consumer’s perspective, there is definitely a need for quick commerce. The platforms offer a lot of convenience,” Jayakumar added.
Recognizing the growing popularity of rapid deliveries, e-commerce leaders like Flipkart and Amazon have entered the space. Even fashion platforms like Myntra have joined the trend. “Myntra has made the move at the right time. If 10% of fashion sales shift to quick commerce, it will pose a challenge for them,” noted Satish Meena, an adviser at Datum Intelligence.
Brands like Fabindia, Decathlon, and
Bata
have already listed their products on these platforms, and more are expected to follow. With Gen Z driving household spending, quick commerce platforms are leveraging this impatient yet tech-savvy demographic to fuel growth.

New Year’s Eve: Quick commerce, food delivery firms post record orders
While quick commerce is thriving in metro cities, expanding into smaller towns may be less profitable. People in smaller cities typically purchase lower-value items like powdered detergent instead of higher-margin products like liquid detergent, which are more popular in metros. “Scaling in tier two and three cities may be difficult, as these markets lack the high AOV categories found in metros,” explained Jayakumar.
Despite these challenges, the sector is projected to surpass $6 billion in sales in 2024, up from $3.5 billion in 2023. Companies like
Swiggy Instamart
are planning to launch larger dark stores in tier-one and tier-two cities, capable of stocking over 50,000 products.
Though quick commerce is growing rapidly, profitability remains a challenge. Companies like
Swiggy
Instamart, Zepto, and Blinkit are currently operating at a loss.
Swiggy
reported a Rs 625 crore loss in the September 2024 quarter, while Zepto’s losses for FY24 stood at Rs 1,200 crore. Regulatory concerns also loom large. The commerce and industry ministry recently held meetings with companies to address complaints from FMCG distributors and trade groups about alleged
FDI
violations and the impact on small kirana stores.
In 2025, consumers can expect an even wider range of products delivered to their doorsteps in 10 minutes, from fashion and electronics to pharmaceuticals and kitchen essentials. However, as companies expand into smaller cities and tackle regulatory challenges, balancing growth with profitability will be a critical hurdle. While the future of quick commerce looks promising, its journey is not without challenges.

Skye Air completes 1.5 lakh deliveries in Gurugram in Dec,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/skye-air-completes-1-5-lakh-deliveries-in-gurugram-in-dec/articleshow/116832106.cms,31-12-2024,"New Delhi:
Skye Air
, a
drone delivery
logistics solution provider, on Tuesday announced completion of 1.5 lakh deliveries in
Gurugram
during the month of December. The company attributed this record to its
technology infrastructure
, partnerships with leading brands, and Gurugram's openness to modern solutions.
""We are delighted to celebrate this milestone in Gurugram, a city known for setting trends in technology adoption. This achievement is a testament not only to our delivery capabilities but also to the trust and enthusiasm of the city's residents,"" CEO Ankit Kumar was quoted as saying in a statement.
December saw a variety of products delivered through this system. High-demand items included premium gadgets like iPhones, skincare essentials, and daily staples like groceries, reflecting the versatility and efficiency of the network.
The surge in delivery volumes was attributed to festive shopping, the convenience of bypassing traffic, and the appeal of
next-generation logistics
solutions. Many of such deliveries are made within seven minutes.
Skye Air is focused on streamlining drone deliveries as a mainstream logistics solution for healthcare, e-commerce, quick commerce, agri-commodity and other industries.

#25 For 2025: Will businesses accept the 10-min delivery challenge?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/25-for-2025-will-businesses-accept-the-10-min-delivery-challenge/articleshow/116815849.cms,31-12-2024,"As I stood at the doorstep of a one-bedroom apartment in Mahadevpura, Bengaluru, the lady of the house patiently answered my questions about her life, having moved here from Assam three years ago with her husband.
She was a regular
quick commerce
customer and I was there to learn why. Her spouse worked as a project manager in construction and used to get the home needs on the way back from work. But any time he was late from work, it would cause significant stress, especially when it was something their 10-month-old child needed. Lack of public transit or even rickshaws meant it was hard for her to reach even nearby places. Quick commerce had made running the household and taking care of their child easy for them.
Their story reminded me of a couple who, 47 years ago, had left their village of 300 people to set up shop in a town called Jaito in Punjab. When I had visited their first home years later, it was a single room which could barely fit a bed. It was in that room that the couple gave birth to my older brother, started a new life and laid the foundation for a future that I am now living.
Blinkit
will open a store in Jaito in 2025. We will play a part in the life stories of millions who, like my parents, seek a better life for themselves and their families. As the needs of these customers evolve, quick commerce companies will step in. Businesses, big and small, will be challenged but they will also find opportunities-much like how the penetration of mobile internet made businesses evolve for the better.
The next 200 cities will get access to a wider variety of products, through a supply chain that is more fair and open for all participants than at any time in our history. All of this will be done so that the families that will power our country's future and progress, get access to world- class products and services, in 10 minutes.

HUL takes direct-to-Kiranas distribution route,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/hul-takes-direct-to-kiranas-distribution-route/articleshow/116807691.cms,31-12-2024,"Mumbai:
Hindustan Unilever
(
HUL
) is taking control of its robust distribution network by directly supplying products to kirana stores in Mumbai, with plans to roll out in Delhi and other top metros, a top company executive said.
The strategy is part of a wider attempt by India's largest fast-moving consumer goods company to reduce the supply time from three days to less than 24 hours, and ease credit limitations of kirana stores, which generate three-fourths of its sales.
Under the new model, distributors will only handle orders and payments from the neighbourhood stores while the company will handle the entire back-end logistics from warehousing to delivery, Arun Neelakantan, executive director-customer development at HUL, told ET.
""Our focus is to ensure that we provide the best service to the kirana stores because we need to have assurance of delivery in the right manner. There are also constraints for cost and capital, which means they can't hold a large inventory. They can't have a large amount of capital blocked and want more frequent service,"" Neelakantan said.
Live Events
Within the consumer goods market, HUL has the largest distribution network in India with over 3,500 distributors across 2,000 towns serving nine million stores including a direct reach of three million outlets.
The company had piloted its latest distribution model-Samadhan-near Chennai nearly two years ago to take on online business-to-business (B2B) startups that have the advantage of serving multiple companies at the same time as well as offering next-day delivery.
In India, kirana stores, serviced by either distributors or wholesalers, control nearly 80% of FMCG sales. While organised retail and wholesalers including Flipkart Wholesale, Udaan, and Reliance Cash and Carry make up about 5% of FMCG sales, they get greater leverage over supplies and price due to their scale.
The maker of Rin, Dove and Lux said while the traditional supply chain is often labour intensive, high maintenance and is prone to errors, distributors ensure that the relationship with the outlet is sustained, and they remain part and parcel of the supply chain going forward. Under the new model, absolute returns earned by distributors will remain unchanged while HUL bears the cost of warehousing operations.
""The kirana stores actually want assurance of delivery. So, the frequency of ordering, the kind of lines that they order, the kind of depth that they order keeps increasing with greater assurance of service and delivery,"" said Neelakantan.
HUL has also carved out separate sales teams for each of its ecommerce verticals spanning marketplace, quick commerce and beauty retailers, which have a combined workforce of about 200 employees. Half of this team either has digital or technology experience, or has earlier worked with direct to consumer or ecommerce firms, and their average age is almost a decade younger than the larger organisation.
""So, the kind of quality of conversation itself is very different, because they know what's happening externally. How we deal with quick commerce is very different from how we deal with marketplace kind of setups and how we deal with the beauty kind of Nykaas of the world. So we don't have a singular e-commerce team. The portfolios in these channels are very different,"" said Neelakantan, adding that 50-55% of the portfolio it sells online is distinct from what it sells in modern trade and general trade.
HUL has also been consistently upgrading its internal ordering app Shikhar, which allows neighbourhood stores to order directly from the company but are still serviced by distributors. At present, Shikhar generates more than a third of HUL's sales.

Its revenue from operations was at Rs 1,809.8 crore, up 4.5 per cent in the financial year that ended on March 31, 2024, according to financial data accessed through business intelligence platform Tofler.
Total income of Ikea India Pvt Ltd was also up 5.12 per cent to Rs 1,852.7 crore in FY24.
Ikea India reported a loss of Rs 1,133 crore and its revenue from operations was at Rs 1,731.6 crore a year earlier.
According to the company, the increase in loss is largely due to investments towards expansion towards omnichannel growth.
""IKEA India maintained solid sales growth despite no price increase and lowering the prices on certain products in FY24. Our losses largely reflect the investment we are making towards our omnichannel growth,"" said an Ikea spokesperson.

Retailers report 7% growth during the festive season,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-report-7-growth-during-the-festive-season/articleshow/116794900.cms,30-12-2024,"Retailers have reported mere 7% growth during the festive season in 2024 compared to last year’s festive season, according to
Retailers Association of India
(RAI).
“RAI’s survey indicates a moderate growth of 7% during the October-November festive season, falling short of the anticipated 10%. Consumption growth has been subdued throughout the year, prompting retailers to boost business through promotional offers and encouraging festive purchases,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI).
“We are hopeful for stronger growth in 2025, as rising operational costs require a sustained growth trajectory to maintain profitability. Inflation, intensified competition, and limited spending, particularly by the lower middle-class population, remain significant challenges,” Rajagopalan said.
The survey further reveals that West India experienced the highest sales growth at 8%, while North, South, and East India each recorded a 7% increase.
In terms of categories, food and grocery registered the highest growth of 14%, followed by 10% in QSR and 9% in jewellery compared to the same festive time period last year.

2025 to be a year of transformation for retail industry; AI & automation to play a crucial role,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/2025-to-be-a-year-of-transformation-for-retail-industry-ai-automation-to-play-a-crucial-role/articleshow/116786168.cms,30-12-2024,"With the rapid evolution of channels like quick-commerce and the emergence of ONDC, the Indian retail industry is 'cautiously optimistic' for 2025, in which new-age technologies such as AI and automation will play a crucial role, driving efficiency and personalisation. The New Year could be a period of transformation for the Indian retail industry, one of the fastest-growing globally, where the contemporary retail landscape is rapidly evolving, influenced by the preferences of digital-first generation Gen Z and retail tech.
Helped by tailwinds such as rising disposable income, rapid urbanisation, the rise of non-metro tier II cities, and growing middle class along with a digitally-savvy consumer base, the organised retail sector is poised to grow expanding its play further with a customer-centric approach.
""FY25 is likely to see continued focus on building supply chain efficiencies, along with upgrades to logistics hubs and tracking systems to meet fast delivery demands. Employment generation in quick commerce, logistics, and related sectors is also expected to continue,"" said
EY India Tax Leader
for Retail Practice Paresh Parekh.
Indian consumers, influenced by global exposure and digital technologies, are prioritising higher quality and value for money. This has resulted in a shift in spending from luxuries to essentials or more affordable options.
""Despite these challenges, the outlook for 2025 remains positive, driven by demographic trends, urbanisation, digital growth, and the aspirations of a young, dynamic middle class,"" he said.
Live Events
Parekh expects an increase in foreign investments in the retail sector and a continuance of consolidation led by PE firms and strategic acquisitions.
According to the Retailers Association of India (RAI), the Indian retail sector in 2024 has witnessed a mix of challenges and opportunities.
""Growth was subdued in the first half, with marginal consumption increases and cautious consumer spending. Many retailers struggled to achieve like-for-like growth, reflecting shifting consumer priorities,"" said its CEO Kumar Rajagopalan adding ""Despite this, the year also brought innovation and resilience.""
Retailers have embraced technology to enhance operations and customer experience and initiatives like ONDC are creating exciting new opportunities, particularly in reaching untapped markets.
""Looking ahead, the sector remains cautiously optimistic. The festive and wedding seasons have boosted momentum, and with strategic planning, retailers can sustain growth into 2025,"" he said.
The Indian retail sector contributes around 10 per cent to its GDP and according to the latest annual report of leading retailer,
Reliance
it is expected to cross USD 1.4 trillion by 2027. It is also poised to become the third-largest market by 2030.
Over the emergence of quick commerce, Deloitte India partner, consumer products and retail sector Anand Ramanathan said it is a ""viable business model"" and it is here to stay.
2024 has been disruptive for the retail sector, which besides the emergence of quick commerce, also saw the revival of mass consumption and the value retail segment for the first time since the pandemic.
""100 million middle-income households will be added this decade to the economy. 2025 will continue to see the impact of this growth in middle-income households with further momentum in mass consumption. This will have a positive impact across sectors including fashion, home and food services,"" said Ramanathan.
Puneet Mansukhani Sector Head - Retail KPMG said in 2024 retailers faced significant challenges due to inflation impacting profitability and supply chain disruptions.
""These issues required strategic pricing adjustments and innovative solutions to maintain smooth operations. The festive season did see some uptake as compared to the previous year but overall the customer was cautious.
""The ecommerce spend in the tier 2 and 3 cities was stronger than urban and the trend is likely to continue which makes the retailers feel bullish and optimistic in 2025,"" he said.
Over the outlook for 2025 for the retail industry, he said continued advancements in AI and automation are ""expected to drive efficiency and personalisation"" in retail, enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency.
Moreover ""increased use of data analytics will enable more personalised shopping experiences, catering to individual consumer preferences,"" he said.
Retailers will likely focus more on sustainability and transparency in their supply chains, responding to consumer demand for ethical practices.
However, Mansukhani also hinted towards economic uncertainty and said ""Inflation and economic volatility may continue to pose challenges, affecting consumer spending patterns.""

"Ikea India's losses swell, sales growth falls to 6-year low",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ikea-indias-losses-swell-sales-growth-falls-to-6-year-low/articleshow/116775220.cms,30-12-2024,"Ikea has posted its slowest sales expansion since it opened its first India store six years ago with a 5% increase to ₹1,852 crore in FY24 while its net loss widened amid large-scale investments to solidify its footprint in the country. The world's largest furniture retailer saw its India business slowing as consumers tightened their wallets on discretionary spends across lifestyle categories.
Its net loss widened 15% to ₹1,303 crore in FY24. So far, the retailer known for its ready-to-assemble products has incurred a cumulative loss of ₹5,550 crore in India as it spent to buy and build distribution centres, a city outlet and three big box stores-each large enough to fit about four football fields.
""Ikea in India maintained a solid sales growth despite no price increase and lowering the prices on certain products in FY24,"" a company spokesperson said. ""Our losses largely reflect the investment we are making towards our omni-channel growth. We remain committed to our plan of opening more stores and serving 200 million people by 2025 through our high quality, affordable range.""
Last fiscal, Ikea cut costs after raw material prices softened, helping the company lower prices of several products by about 20% both in India as well as globally.
Earlier this year, the flat-pack furniture giant said it is still trying to get a foothold in the Indian market and that it will take at least 8-10 stores to benefit from economies of scale.

""The sooner we can get to that, the better,"" Jesper Brodin, global chief executive officer of Ingka Group that owns Ikea, told ET in February this year. ""Chapter one was the sourcing and foundation and then getting the first door up and running. And then the intention is to get the company in top big cities. We are measuring out and laying out plans to see how we can do it for 1.4 billion people. And if I am certain about anything, it is that the economic outlook for India is looking good,"" he said.
Ikea started sourcing from India in the 1980s and has more than five dozen suppliers in the country, most of them in textiles. Over a decade ago, the erstwhile Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) had approved Ikea's ₹10,500-crore investment proposal to open 25 stores in the country by 2025. It has since opened three large-format stores in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bengaluru and one smaller city store in Mumbai. It aims to open bigger stores in Gurugrma and Noida in the National Capital Region soon.
The Swedish retailer, which opened its first India store in 2018 in Hyderabad, has been a runaway success in the country, outpacing local rivals Urban Ladder and Pepperfry in its first year of operations with that single outlet. During the year, Ikea's paid-up share capital was increased by ₹600 crore to ₹4.615 crore.
""When we think about India, we think about size,"" Brodin told ET in February. ""In terms of investment priorities, India ranks one, two and three. We have consciously decided we cannot financially afford to be in the startup phase in too many places. But India is the top priority for us now.""

Tata Sons may infuse fresh funds into ecomm arm only by mid-2025,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tata-sons-may-infuse-fresh-funds-into-ecomm-arm-only-by-mid-2025/articleshow/116660948.cms,26-12-2024,"Tata Sons
may infuse the next round of
capital
into its ecommerce business,
Tata Digital
, only in mid-2025. Until then, the new commerce entity will have to rely on internal funding and debt financing to fuel growth, officials familiar with the matter told ET.
The mandate for all business heads is to focus on growth after the company's new CEO,
Naveen Tahilyani
, implemented tighter spending controls and emphasised better execution, accountability, and return on capital (ROC) employed.
Aggressive Push
Tata Neu
is now aggressively leveraging a data-driven strategy to tap every consumer access point within the system, including partnerships with external entities, officials said. As part of this strategy, most of the new funding for
BigBasket
and 1mg is being secured through debt rather than fresh equity infusion. Tata Sons has invested over $2 billion in Tata Digital's super app to date.
ET had reported earlier about financing plans of egrocer BigBasket and epharmacy 1mg.
Live Events
Known for his execution expertise, Tahilyani is driving performance by offering Esops to top performers and instilling greater accountability. A new set of business leaders has also been brought in to strengthen this performance-oriented culture, officials noted.
In November 2024,
Croma
, which contributes the highest revenue to Tata Neu, appointed Shibashish Roy as its new CEO. Roy has been tasked with driving growth following an initial round of restructuring aimed at enhancing agility.
""The focus is now on growth and scale. Challenges related to organisational cohesion have been addressed, and the priority is to scale up for the next level of growth,"" said an official aware of the plans.
Tata Digital did not comment.
To be sure, Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran has instructed the management to focus urgently on profitable growth.
""The message is clear. Grow but also in a sustainable manner as some of the large businesses, like BigBasket, will be tapped for an IPO over the next couple of years,"" said a source aware of the company's monetistion plans of Bombay House. While the core grocery business of BigBasket had stabilised on profitability, the Bengaluru-based firm is spending most of its capital toward
quick commerce
following its pivot to the 15-30 minute delivery service.
Tata Neu has also launched Neu Flash to users selling grocery, fashion, electronics and other items. Quick commerce is seeing intense investment and competition from players such as Zepto, Blinkit and Instamart, while the likes of Flipkart have also upped the ante with Minutes. Amazon, too, is on the verge of entering the sector.
Last Fiscal Revenue
Last year, Neu recorded a GMV (gross merchandise value) of less than $1 billion, excluding individual gross sales from apps like 1mg and BigBasket.
Tata Digital reported standalone revenue of ₹204.3 crore in FY23, reflecting nearly 13-fold growth compared to the previous year, as per Tata Sons' annual report. However, the unit also recorded a standalone loss of ₹1,370 crore, a 23% increase year-on-year.
For FY24, Tata Digital's total turnover more than doubled to ₹420.5 crore from ₹204.3 crore in FY23. The company also narrowed its standalone losses to ₹1,201 crore from ₹1,370 crore in the previous year.
These figures do not include the performance of its subsidiaries. Croma, one of the largest businesses on Neu, reported a turnover of ₹15,851 crore in FY23, with a loss of ₹325 crore during the same period.
Tata Cliq
reported revenue of ₹78.5 crore in FY23, along with a loss of ₹175 crore, as per the report.
Tata Digital reported an aggregate GMV of ₹37,355 crore in FY24.
Fashion, a key category for any ecommerce platform, makes Tata Cliq a crucial business for Neu. Tata Cliq, housed under Tata Unistore and led by CEO Gopal Asthana, is collaborating closely with the Neu team to scale up its fashion business. Asthana was appointed CEO following the departure of Vikas Purohit last October.

"Fast, faster, fastest: How 2024 put more speed into your shopping",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/fast-faster-fastest-how-2024-put-more-speed-into-your-shopping/articleshow/116647427.cms,25-12-2024,"The year 2024 has proven to be a landmark year for quick commerce, or q-comm, in India, with the sector seeing rapid growth, innovation, and widespread adoption. As consumer expectations for faster delivery times and more convenience continue to rise, quick commerce — an industry focused on delivering goods in as little as 10 to 30 minutes — has reshaped the e-commerce landscape, especially in urban centres.
The shift toward ultra-fast delivery services gained traction in 2023, but it was in 2024 that the sector truly took off, driven by technological advancements, improved infrastructure, and increased investment from both domestic and international players.
Swiggy’s
IPO
success: A premium start
Swiggy’s November 2024 IPO marked a significant achievement as it listed at a 5.6% premium to its offer price of Rs 390. The Rs 11,327 crore offering became the sixth-largest in India, receiving a strong 3.59 times subscription, primarily driven by institutional investors. The IPO's success was further underscored by the Rs 5,085 crore raised from 151 anchor investors.
A major chunk of the funds from the IPO is earmarked for expanding Swiggy’s quick commerce business, Instamart, which competes with other players like
Blinkit
,
Zepto
, and
Flipkart
Quick. Swiggy aims to capitalise on the growing demand for ultra-fast delivery services, positioning
Instamart
as a key player in India’s rapidly evolving quick commerce sector.
Live Events
The IPO saw participation from prominent investors like Prosus, Accel, Elevation Capital, Meituan, Tencent, and Swiggy’s founders, who together sold over 175 million shares. This broad investor base signals strong confidence in Swiggy's growth prospects, particularly in the competitive quick commerce space.
Flipkart joins the quick-commerce race
Walmart-owned Flipkart officially launched its quick-commerce service, Flipkart Minutes, in August, entering the fast-paced world of ultra-rapid deliveries. Initially available in select areas of Bengaluru, the service, which was previously in a trial phase for Flipkart employees, is now accessible to a broader audience. The service went live on the Flipkart app, with plans to expand to more Bengaluru areas.
In neighbourhoods like Belandur and HSR, Flipkart Minutes is delivering everything from groceries to electronics and smartphones within an impressive 8 to 16 minutes. This marks Flipkart’s formal entry into the competitive quick-commerce market, going head-to-head with industry giants like Swiggy’s Instamart, Zomato’s Blinkit, Zepto, and BigBasket’s BB Now.
What’s more, Flipkart announced in December that it is set to revolutionise the quick-commerce space by introducing 10-minute deliveries for medicines, likely making it the first service in the segment to offer this rapid delivery. To achieve this, Flipkart has begun partnering with local chemists in metro cities to source medicines, leveraging its extensive last-mile delivery network to bring prescriptions straight to consumer's doors at lightning speed.
Myntra
jumps in with M-Now
Fashion e-tailer Myntra officially launched its 30-minute delivery service, M-Now, in December -- making it the first niche e-commerce platform in India to enter the quick commerce space at scale. The service is currently live in select areas of Bengaluru, offering a curated selection of around 10,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs). Myntra plans to expand the service to major cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, and Pune in the coming months, aiming to revolutionise the way fashion and beauty products are delivered.
M-Now promises lightning-fast deliveries of fashion, beauty products, and accessories within just 30 minutes. Myntra will rely on dark stores (micro-warehouses) and third-party retail stores to fulfil orders. Myntra CEO Nandita Sinha revealed that the company plans to expand its offerings significantly, with over 100,000 SKUs expected to be available under M-Now within the next three to four months. In an effort to strengthen its delivery infrastructure, Myntra may also tap into its parent company Flipkart’s quick commerce service, Minutes, for additional support.
Amazon
races to launch quick commerce service
Amazon India announced that it is gearing up to launch its much-anticipated quick commerce delivery service, codenamed Tez, by late December 2024 or early next year. Initially set for a 2025 rollout, the e-commerce giant is now fast-tracking its entry into the booming quick commerce sector, which has seen impressive growth this year, with companies like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart leading the charge.
Tez will mark Amazon’s first-ever venture into the quick commerce space globally, making its launch a significant milestone for the company. Although Tez is a working title for now, the service will bring Amazon into direct competition with established players in India’s fastest-growing online market. With Amazon being the only major e-commerce player yet to enter this sector, the company is keen to catch up with rivals who are already making waves in the ultra-fast delivery game.
Originally planned for the first quarter of 2025, Amazon pushed to bring Tez to market sooner in late December. ET first reported about Amazon’s plans on a quick commerce offering in its edition of August 28.
Tata
announces
Neu
Flash
The Tatas were also among the big names to jump on to the ultra-fast delivery bandwagon in 2024. In October, the steel-to-software conglomerate announced its plans to launch Neu Flash, a quick commerce service under its e-commerce venture, Neu. As demand for faster deliveries in metro cities continues to soar, Tata’s Neu Flash is poised to deliver groceries, electronics, and fashion products to select users in the coming weeks, with more customers added gradually.
Neu Flash will leverage Tata Group’s vast portfolio of brands to fulfil orders. For groceries, the service will be powered by BigBasket - which itself is set to become full-scale qcomm platform- while Croma will take care of electronics and phones. Tata Cliq will handle fashion and lifestyle products, initially offering a curated selection of stock-keeping units (SKUs). This multi-brand approach allows Tata to tap into several key verticals, making it a serious contender in the quick commerce space.
Nykaa
's beauty rush
In October, beauty retailer Nykaa took a bold step into the quick commerce space by launching a 10-minute delivery pilot in Borivali, Mumbai. This move comes as the rapid growth of quick commerce disrupts various product categories, forcing vertical players like Nykaa to speed up their delivery game. The beauty industry, in particular, has seen a surge in demand on platforms such as Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and BigBasket’s BB Now, where beauty products have become top sellers.
Nykaa’s 10-minute delivery service is initially being tested in select areas of Mumbai, with plans for an expansion to additional pin codes in the city. Sources close to the matter revealed to ET that Nykaa is also gearing up for a major platform overhaul to accommodate the rapid delivery model in other locations.
To keep things fresh and distinguish the service, Nykaa is expected to launch its quick commerce offering under a new brand name. The move reflects the company's commitment to capturing the growing demand for ultra-fast deliveries in the beauty space and shows how quickly the sector is evolving to meet consumer expectations.
Zomato raises Rs 8,500 crore through QIP
Food and grocery delivery giant Zomato successfully completed its Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP), raising a substantial Rs 8,500 crore in November. The company allocated 33.65 crore shares at Rs 252.62 each, representing a 5% discount to the floor price of Rs 265.91 set earlier. The QIP marked a significant move for Zomato as it strengthened its position in the highly competitive food delivery and quick commerce sectors.
Zomato plans to utilize the proceeds from this fundraising for key strategic initiatives, primarily focusing on expanding its quick-commerce arm, Blinkit. The funds are set to fuel Zomato’s aggressive growth plans in an area that has seen fierce competition with rivals like Swiggy’s Instamart, Flipkart’s Minutes, and others.
A major chunk—around Rs 2,137 crore—will be allocated to setting up and running operations of dark stores and warehouses, which are central to Blinkit’s promise of ultra- fast delivery. Additionally, Zomato intends to channel some of the funds into enhancing its advertising and marketing efforts to solidify its market share in both the food delivery and quick commerce spaces.
Zepto fattens its war chest
Quick commerce player Zepto has been on a fundraising spree, securing another $340 million (Rs 2,850 crore) in August from new investors, including General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital, and Epiq Capital. This latest injection of capital brings the total funding raised in just two months to a staggering $1 billion, propelling Zepto’s valuation to $5 billion.
The company's meteoric rise is a testament to the booming rapid-delivery sector, with Zepto’s valuation soaring 3.5 times in just one year. Back in June, the company raised $665 million at a post-money valuation of $3.6 billion, highlighting the accelerated growth and investor confidence in the space.
Zepto’s fundraising journey didn’t stop in August. In November, the company raised an additional $350 million from a diverse group of Indian high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), family offices, and financial institutions. The round was led by Motilal Oswal’s private wealth division, reinforcing the company’s strong backing from a wide range of investors.

"Gucci in Gwalior, Rolex in Nagpur: Luxury finds its way to India’s smaller cities",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/gucci-in-gwalior-rolex-in-nagpur-luxury-finds-its-way-to-indias-smaller-cities/articleshow/116609578.cms,24-12-2024,"Gucci shoes
and
Louis Vuitton bags
aren't just selling in India's big cities. Such
high-end consumption patterns
are emerging in other towns and locations in the country.
Some of the notable purchases this year on
Tata CLiQ Luxury
include pre-owned Rolex watches sold in Ajmer and Nagpur, handbags from Mulberry sold in Nadiad and Aligarh, and products from Bulgari sold in Etah and Karimnagar, among other locations.
""Ecommerce has enabled the luxury industry to increase its reach and become more accessible,"" said Gopal Asthana, CEO of Tata CLiQ. ""On Tata CLiQ Luxury, approximately 55% of the platform's overall revenue comes from the non-metro markets.""
Its TimeVallee portfolio, featuring brands such as Cartier, IWC, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Panerai and Piaget, also sees approximately 40% of its sales from non-metro markets. ""The growing demand not only reflects the evolving aspirations of consumers across India but also reinforces our dedication to making premium and luxury brands accessible nationwide,"" Asthana said.
Online business from smaller towns is twice as much as last year, said Neeraj Walia, managing director and CEO of Montblanc India.
Live Events
""We see clients picking up limited editions and special products from Ranchi, Kanpur, Guwahati and Gwalior. We are servicing over 320 cities when it comes to online sales. About a year and a half ago, it would have been around 230,"" Walia said, adding, ""Leather categories are doing extremely well.""
Travel retail on the rise
Travel retail has also picked up, with flight connectivity having become more extensive.
""We have boutiques at Bengaluru and Delhi airports and we see clients from non-metros picking up products while they are transiting or moving in and out of the airports,"" Walia said. Fuelled by high aspirations, India's growth story is playing out far beyond the metros, in tier 2 and 3 cities, said Sandeep Ghosh, group country manager, India and South Asia at Visa.
""With a young demographic and an expanding middle-class, India's tier 2 cities and beyond, are displaying a greater propensity to spend,"" he said. ""Insights from our upcoming Visa Consulting & Analytics India Study shows that in the last five years, across tier 3+ towns, the number of credit cardholders spending above ₹2 lakh annually grew 4x-compared to 1.4x growth in annual card spends in tier 1 cities-indicating a democratisation of affluence of sorts.""
Luxury watch sales in India's
tier 2 and tier 3 cities
are on the rise, driven by increasing digitalisation, said Sanjay Mishra, director, India, FM International Watches & Jewellery Pvt Ltd (Franck Muller).
""Every Indian market has its own significance such as Ahmedabad, which is known for its high-spending capacity and affinity for luxury goods, or Pune, which is a significant market for luxury watches, with consumers seeking premium products,"" he said. ""Lucknow and Kochi are emerging as a key market for luxury watches and Surat has been a promising market due to its per capita spends and proximity to Mumbai. Some customers are spending upwards of ₹26 lakh per annum on
luxury goods
online. We are planning to have a presence in Ahmedabad in 2025.""
Tier 2, 3 locations
At Luxepolis, an online marketplace for certified pre-owned and discounted luxury goods, the share of sales in tier 2, tier 3 locations is up 52% this year from 42% two-three years ago, said founder Vijay KG.
""Our customers are spread across markets such as Surat, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Gangtok and Kochi, Solapur, Aurangabad, Salem and Tiruchirappalli,"" he said. ""There is greater awareness among consumers and we have seen customers from Khammam in Telangana asking for marquee and niche bags from brands such as Givenchy and Chloe.""
BSE-listed Ethos Ltd, which retails luxury watches, has launched boutiques in locations such as Kochi, Dehradun and Mangaluru, according to a November investor presentation.
""Since April 2024, we have opened 12 new stores, with plans to open 13 more by the end of financial year 2025, in line with our objective to expand our presence quickly and enter new cities where we currently do not have a presence,"" MD and CEO Pranav Saboo said in the investor presentation. ""We are now operational in 26 cities with a total of 72 stores.""

An email seeking comments from Reliance Retail remained unanswered.
Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had last week said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that at all times, an indigenous retail platform for Shein will be hosted on infrastructure in India with Shein having no access to, or rights over, such data. He added in the reply that the ministry of textiles after consultation with MeitY and the ministry of home affairs had ""no objection"" to Reliance Retail's proposal.
According to an October report by Reuters citing data by The Information, Shein's revenue growth slowed to 23% in the first half of this year, from 40% the previous year, ahead of a stock market listing in London.
A report by consulting firm Redseer Strategy Consultants said that the Indian fast fashion market is expected to cross $50 billion in sales by FY31. The report added that the Indian fast fashion would make up for 25-30% of overall fashion retail by FY31 in the Indian market.
The market is, however, flooded with hundreds of unorganised players competing for market share. Goyal added that Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd has signed a technology agreement with Roadget Business Pte Ltd to develop an indigenous ecommerce retail platform. He further said the platform intends to create a network of local manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture and sell products under the brand name Shein.

"CCPA issues 325 notices for consumer rights violations, imposes Rs 1.19 crore in penalties",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ccpa-issues-325-notices-for-consumer-rights-violations-imposes-rs-1-19-crore-in-penalties/articleshow/116443103.cms,18-12-2024,"The Central
Consumer Protection Authority
(
CCPA
) has issued 325 notices for violation of consumer rights,
misleading advertisements
and
unfair trade practices
and imposed total penalties amounting to Rs. 1.19 cr, said BL Verma, Union Minister of State for the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in a written reply today in the Lok Sabha.
Under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), an executive agency, came into existence on July 24, 2020. It is designed to intervene, to prevent consumer detriment arising from unfair trade practices and to initiate class action(s), including the enforcement of recalls, refunds and return of products. Its core mandate is to prevent and regulate false or misleading advertisements which are prejudicial to the public interest.
The CCPA has notified the “Guidelines for Prevention of Misleading Advertisements and Endorsements for Misleading Advertisements, 2022” on 9th June, 2022.
Among other things, these guidelines provide for; conditions for an advertisement to be non-misleading and valid; certain stipulations in respect of bait advertisements and free claim advertisements; and, duties of manufacturer, service provider, advertiser and advertising agency. These guidelines states that due diligence is required for endorsement of advertisements such that any endorsement in an advertisement must reflect the genuine, reasonably current opinion of the individual, group or organisation making such representation and must be based on adequate information about, or experience with, the identified goods, product or service and must not otherwise be deceptive.
""With a view to modernize the framework governing the consumer protection in the new era of globalization, technologies, e-commerce markets etc. Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was repealed and Consumer Protection Act, 2019 was enacted,"" said Verma.
Live Events
""Unfair trade practice"" encompasses deceptive methods such as misrepresenting product standards, falsely advertising old goods as new, claiming unverified sponsorship or benefits, offering misleading warranties, misrepresenting prices, or disparaging competitors’ goods or services. These provisions ensure accountability, transparency and fairness, safeguarding consumer interests in a dynamic marketplace.
Section 2(28) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 defines “misleading advertisement” in relation to any product or service, as an advertisement, which falsely describes such product or service or gives a false guarantee to, or is likely to mislead the consumers as to the nature, substance, quantity or quality of such product or service; or conveys an express or implied representation which, if made by the manufacturer or seller or service provider thereof, would constitute an unfair trade practice or deliberately conceals important information.
""To safeguard consumers from unfair trade practices in e-commerce, the Department of Consumer Affairs has also notified the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020 under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019,"" said Verma.
He added, ""The CCPA has enacted the “Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Greenwashing and Misleading Environmental Claims, 2024”, mandating transparency in environmental claims, and the “Guidelines for Prevention of Misleading Advertisements in the Coaching Sector, 2024” (effective 13th November 2024), addressing false claims, exaggerated success rates, and unfair practices in coaching institutes.""
The CCPA issued the “Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023” on 30th November, 2023. These guidelines address and regulate 13 specific dark patterns identified in the e-commerce sector, aiming to prevent deceptive practices that mislead consumers.
""The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced the framework on ‘Online Consumer Reviews — Principles and Requirements for their Collection, Moderation, and Publication’ on 23rd November 2022. This framework safeguards consumer interests by addressing fake and deceptive reviews in e-commerce. While the standards are voluntary, they apply to all online platforms that publish consumer reviews and are guided by principles such as integrity, accuracy, privacy, security, transparency, accessibility and responsiveness,"" said Verma.

, retailers are calling for measures that could transform the sector, including low-interest financing, tax relief, and a faster rollout of the
National Retail Policy
. The
Retailers Association of India
(RAI), in its pre-budget memorandum, urged the government to use the
Union Budget
for FY25-26 as a platform to address structural gaps, boost consumption, and improve ease of doing business. These changes, the RAI stated, would bolster consumer sentiment and support growth in the retail sector.
A key demand from retailers is affordable financing. RAI highlighted the need for the government to announce lower interest rates specifically for retail businesses in the budget. “There is a need to provide lower interest rates to the retailers through the special announcement in the budget to assure easier financing for the retail businesses,” RAI stated.
The association proposed the creation of a special fund, facilitated by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), to help independent retailers across the nation. This scheme could provide low-cost loans and relaxed regulatory guidelines to millions of small businesses, addressing a critical gap in financing options.
Budget 2025: A catalyst for National Retail Policy
Retail is one of India’s largest employment-generating sectors and a significant contributor to GDP. Budget 2025 could be a turning point for the sector, driving formalisation, increasing consumption, and fostering economic resilience amid global uncertainties. Targeted measures to support retailers would not only benefit the industry but also help meet the government’s broader economic objectives.
The RAI also urged the government to expedite the implementation of a National Retail Policy, which has been in discussion for several years. ""There is a need to expedite the formulation and implementation of National policy. We believe that such a step would provide a substantial boost to the retail sector and facilitate ease of doing business,"" the association noted.

Budget Priority: MSME benefits for retailers
The RAI recommended extending all MSME benefits to retail and wholesale traders. While these businesses are included under MSMEs and can register on the Udyam Registration Portal, their benefits are currently limited to priority sector lending. “We recommend that retail and wholesale traders should be eligible for all benefits available to other MSMEs,” the memorandum emphasized.
Budget 2025’s role in taxation
The association also warned the government against potential GST hikes on price-sensitive goods, including apparel, footwear, handbags, cosmetics, and watches. “Such increases may jeopardise the formalisation of trade, encouraging a shift toward unorganised markets,” RAI stated. Instead, the association advocated a balanced approach to safeguard the formal retail ecosystem and maintain consumer confidence.
Highlighting the importance of the food and beverage (F&B) retail sector, the RAI suggested recognizing it as an essential service. ""F&B retail sector needs to be considered as a priority and an essential service. Subsidies and benefits should be given on land rates and other necessities such as electricity,"" the RAI said, stressing the need for government support to reduce operational costs.

Kirana stores agree on a potential plan to survive the quick commerce takeover,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/kirana-stores-agree-on-a-potential-plan-to-survive-the-quick-commerce-takeover/articleshow/116429139.cms,18-12-2024,"Nearly 80% of kirana stores losing business share to
quick commerce platforms
said that it is time they focus on digitalisation to compete with them.
In a survey conducted by Kiko Live, a SaaS solution for neighbourhood stores, a majority of the stores felt that overall sales volume has reduced because of loss of business to quick commerce platforms. Price competition from quick commerce, speed of delivery and delayed product availability are three of the key issues that kirana stores are facing.
In order to get business back, 80% of the kirana store owners felt that they should focus on going online, as digitalisation and quick commerce are essential for growth. They felt that partnering with e-commerce platforms and the government can help expand business. They also felt that it is important to improve customer service, social media presence and increase product range in order to compete with quick commerce players.
“Kiko Live is helping sellers build their digital storefront on ONDC Network and give their store customers an online experience Kiko Live aims to on-board more cities across all tiers to enhance ordering ease through ONDC,” said Alok Chawla, co-founder, Kiko Live.
Strong supply chains and digital marketing are important along with partnerships like ONDC for wider reach for neighbourhood kirana stores. Offering quick home delivery and loyalty programs can enhance customer satisfaction and competitiveness.
Live Events
Most of the survey respondents expressed optimism about the future, believing that transitioning to online and quick commerce platforms can help businesses grow within 1-2 years. About 84% of the respondents have already started using technology and digitalisation to some extent at present. However, there were some concerns about survival if current trends continue without adaptation.
About 13 million kirana stores in India generate over $800 billion in annual business, yet most of them do not have a digital footprint. Kiko Live has enabled high fulfillment rates by the retailers, with sellers achieving 99% order fill rates to date. These efforts have led to order cancellation rates of less than 1% and repeat buying rates that have been crossing 30% of all orders.

India presents a tough battleground for US consumer giant Walmart,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indias-political-and-regulatory-ecommerce-minefield-creates-a-tough-battleground-for-us-consumer-giant-walmarts-flipkart-ipo/articleshow/116418671.cms,18-12-2024,"E-commerce in India
is a political and regulatory minefield. US consumer giant
Walmart
Inc. — which has been waiting to launch the much-anticipated initial public offering of the online marketplace it acquired for $16 billion six years ago — has had its patience tested. It’s unlikely to get Flipkart out the door next year: A 2026 IPO may be a more reasonable expectation, with a little diplomatic help from the incoming government in Washington.
The business side of things is not the reason for the delay. Flipkart is the country’s largest e-commerce player, ahead of Amazon.com Inc. The homegrown app lacks the consumer-service finesse of its rival, but its sheer reach across a continent-sized geography gives it the heft that took the likes of Unilever Plc a century to build.

HUL, don't get Unileverised: The ice cream business melted away, but what’s next?
That’s what makes the public float, preferably an IPO in Mumbai’s capital market, an important device for signaling Walmart’s long-term commitment — and an attractive proposition for investors even amid India’s slowing economic growth.
Flipkart is a stake Walmart has put down in a market where brick-and-mortar foreign retailers face stifling restrictions. That’s not an immediate problem; it might take a decade before Indians have the purchasing power to sustain a franchise like Sam’s Club, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based firm’s members-only warehouse division that is defying China’s consumption funk. The question is, will New Delhi be ready for Sam’s Club in 10 years?

Walmart has already spent nearly two decades waiting for local regulations to become a little more welcoming of its investment dollars. The firm’s partnership with Sunil Mittal, the Indian telecom czar who was going to prize open the market for the US retailer in 2007, ended six years later. Even Walmart’s second shot — the Flipkart acquisition — has had to constantly tiptoe around regulations that forbid foreign-backed e-commerce platforms from owning inventory.

India, with booming billionaires, is the gold mine luxury brands have been hunting for
On paper, that rule is all about safeguarding livelihoods of the corner kirana stores, tens of millions of tiny enterprises catering to 1.4 billion consumers. In reality, though, mom-and-pop shops are being shielded only from the Americans. The laws that target Walmart and Amazon are not about size or dominance, but the color of money. This is laughable because even large Indian players like Mukesh Ambani, the country’s richest tycoon who’s also its biggest retailer, have tapped billions of dollars from global investors: It’s all greenbacks, all the way.
Indian retailers, offline and online, can be as creative as they want in flexing their financial muscles, but foreign-owned e-commerce platforms aren’t allowed to use their deep pockets to exert influence on behavior. India’s Enforcement Directorate, the federal financial-crime agency, recently raided some Flipkart and Amazon sellers to investigate if they’ve been breaking the foreign-investment law, Reuters reported last month. The commerce minister in New Delhi has
accused the platforms of “predatory pricing.”

Separately, India’s Competition Commission has asked the US firms to share their financial statements so that it can determine how much to fine them after a four-year-old investigation. Flipkart can’t possibly sell shares before it knows how much it has to pony up. The anti-monopoly watchdog could impose a charge of as much as 10% of the global turnover of Indian entities.
E-commerce is just about 5% to 6% of India’s retail market, compared with more than 35% in China. Lack of competition is a far bigger pain point for consumers in industries such as aviation, where the near-total control of the domestic market by just two airlines means high prices and limited choice.
The story in e-tailing is just the opposite. Thanks to the billions of dollars flowing into fueling India’s craze for quick commerce, consumers nowadays expect the T-shirts and light bulbs they order at 4 a.m. to arrive by 4:10 a.m.
Investors may well figure out in a few years that the 10-minute gratification model of Indian startups like Blinkit, Zepto, or Swiggy Instamart is not really something that can be sustained outside of big cities. The economics will be prohibitively expensive. But while the exuberance lasts, Walmart will also flank its mainstream online marketplace with Flipkart Minutes to compete. So will Amazon.

Amazon to launch quick commerce deliveries in India amid boom in segment
If anything, quick commerce might be a bigger headache for Ambani, whose retail empire has had a “forgettable year,” according to the brokerage Jefferies, marked by store closures, weak revenue, and rising competition in a slowing economy.
Ambani, too, would be looking to spin off the retail unit from his flagship
Reliance Industries Ltd.
, which is underperforming both the benchmark index and analysts’ expectations. As long as Flipkart and Amazon are stuck in the labyrinths of regulatory scrutiny, Ambani has time to fix his moat.
But a delayed
Flipkart IPO
could just become a lightning rod for the incoming Trump administration to negotiate hard for US firms’ access to Indian retail. To avoid a trade war, New Delhi may have no option except to offer concessions and dial down its protectionist regulations. That’s when Walmart’s India acquisition, the biggest-ever deal in its history, would truly pay off.

Decathlon starts listing rival brands on its site,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/decathlon-starts-listing-rival-brands-on-its-site/articleshow/116410818.cms,18-12-2024,"Mumbai: Sporting goods retailer
Decathlon
has started listing
rival brands
, including
Adidas
and
Garmin
, connecting buyers and sellers online even as stores sell the French company's brands in India.
Online sales
account for 15-20% of the company's revenue of about ₹4,500 crore a year in India, of which 30% comes from shoes and 30%-32% from apparel.
Globally, rival brands account for a fifth of Decathlon's revenue but in India, everything from running shoes to mountaineering equipment is sold under its own labels, in line with the local rules. India permits 100% FDI in
single-brand retail
, with different products sold under one brand, the route taken by companies such as Decathlon, Ikea, Nike and Adidas. FDI in multi-brand retail-the sale of many brands under one roof directly to consumers-is not allowed.
A Decathlon India spokesperson said the company displays products from other brands on its platform for easy viewing and to make sporting goods accessible to more people but redirects consumers to the respective brand's website for billing and fulfilment. ""We are a single-brand retail company and not a marketplace. In alignment with FDI norms, we neither facilitate nor are involved in the sale, management of inventory, collection of payments or providing last-mile delivery service as is done in a marketplace model,"" the spokesperson said.
India allows 100% FDI under automatic route in the marketplace model of
ecommerce
, under which the company can't hold any inventory, a model Decathlon is now following online. Last year, its global CEO Barbara Martin Coppola said the company was in discussions with the Indian government for allowing it to sell products from rival brands in its stores.

"India, with booming billionaires, is the gold mine luxury brands have been hunting for",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/premium-products-in-india-luxury-items-india-with-booming-billionaires-is-the-gold-mine-luxury-brands-have-been-hunting-for/articleshow/116360435.cms,16-12-2024,"India's luxury market is undergoing a remarkable transformation, driven by a rising number of high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), an expanding middle class, and growing disposable incomes. Global
luxury brands
are increasingly eyeing India as a key market for their expansion, tapping into the country's growing appetite for premium products. As wealth rises and aspirations soar, India is emerging as a critical battleground for luxury retailers, a trend that has only accelerated since the pandemic.
One of the most significant shifts in the luxury landscape is the influx of global brands aiming to diversify their markets. With China facing an economic slowdown, luxury giants are now looking beyond their traditional markets, and India is quickly becoming one of their top choices.
""India is one of our fastest growing markets though our presence is currently concentrated in Delhi and Mumbai. Over the next decade, we anticipate India to become one of the most promising markets for the luxury industry, particularly for fine watches,"" Jean-Marc Pontroue, CEO of Panerai, told ToI.
The strategy of reaching more consumers in India, especially when luxury real estate is in limited supply, is one reason brands like Bulgari, or Bvlgari, are tapping into the online market.

Bvlgari, the renowned Italian luxury brand known for its exquisite jewellery, watches, fragrances, and leather goods, has recently launched its first digital boutique in India, in partnership with Tata CLiQ Luxury. ""The luxury market has grown a lot over the last decade and, driven by China, the boom has been extraordinary,"" said Bvlgari’s CEO Jean Christophe Babin. However, with China reaching maturity and undergoing a slowdown, Babin sees India as a far more promising and untapped opportunity for luxury brands to grow. He adds, ""India might become one of the most significant markets for western luxury.""
This ""China+1"" strategy is now being adopted by a growing number of Western companies that are diversifying operations to mitigate risks in China due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions and post-COVID disruptions. India, with its rising wealth and large population, is seen as an ideal location to balance operations and target a rapidly expanding consumer base.
The demand for luxury products in India is showing no signs of slowing down. The luxury segment has experienced a steady upward trajectory since the pandemic.
Anurag Mathur, partner at Bain & Company, told ToI, ""In terms of the depth of luxury buying, India is still more than a decade behind China but the reconstitution of consumption happening in China and the rising population of HNIs in India have definitely piqued brands' interest to pursue India in a big way.""
In line with this,
Amazon India
’s director of fashion and beauty, Zeba Khan, had earlier highlighted the
premiumisation trend sweeping across several categories
in e-commerce. “Sales of gold and diamond jewellery, including lab-grown diamonds, are seeing five times increase over last year, while sales of premium watches have grown six times over the previous year,"" she said.
The premiumisation wave extends beyond jewellery and watches to automobiles, where manufacturers are witnessing a surge in demand for high-end features such as advanced safety systems and comfort-enhancing technologies in vehicles.
Not only are large brands betting big on India's growing luxury market, but several new players are entering the scene as well. Swiss watchmaker Charriol, Italian footwear brands Aquazzura and Golden Goose, and British home textiles company Christy are some of the recent entrants. Charriol, in particular, is betting on India as a key market for its luxury watch segment, having partnered with Titan’s Helios for its India foray. ""Indians are travelling more and for us, it is the right time to start in India,"" says Coralie Charriol, CEO and creative director at Charriol.

India's retail has a spring in its step: High-end shopping malls
India is experiencing an economic boom, with an increasing number of billionaires calling the country home. According to the 2024 Hurun India Rich List, India now boasts 334 billionaires, an increase of 75 from the previous year. This rise in wealth is contributing to an ever-expanding demand for luxury goods across the country. It’s not just big cities like Mumbai and Delhi that are witnessing this growth. Smaller cities, such as Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Chandigarh, are also showing a keen interest in premium goods.
The luxury retail market in India is valued at approximately $8 billion and is expected to grow to $14 billion by 2032, according to analysts at BCG. One company that is benefiting from this growth is Rado, which saw record sales in 2024. ""The key to our success are our high-tech ceramic products and qualitative distribution network,"" said Rado CEO Adrian Bosshard.
Luxury brands are also adjusting their offerings to cater to Indian tastes, with many introducing India-exclusive collections or festive packaging. Swiss luxury chocolate brand Laderach, for instance, has experienced a 15% year-on-year growth since launching in India in 2023. Sanskriti Gupta, spokesperson for Laderach India, notes, ""Luxury brands are also tailoring their products to suit Indian preferences – whether it's designing collections inspired by local culture or offering India-exclusive products.""

At the same time, real estate giants such as DLF are experiencing significant interest from international luxury brands wanting to tap into India's youthful and digitally-savvy audience. Pushpa Bector, senior executive director and business head at DLF Retail, stated, “Retail spaces like DLF Emporio and The Chanakya have set the stage for this influx, and we are actively engaging with several luxury players planning their India foray.”
Platforms such as Ajio Luxe and Tata Cliq Luxury are also helping global brands reach smaller cities and towns in India. Namit Puri, India leader of consumer goods practice at BCG, observed, ""Rising affluence and aspiration in cities like Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Chandigarh are expanding the market beyond traditional metros.""
Looking ahead, analysts predict that India’s luxury retail market will continue to outpace the general retail sector. Deloitte India’s Anand Ramanathan, partner and leader of the consumer products and retail sector, shared, ""While the overall local retail market is expected to double its growth by 2030, luxury retail is projected to grow six times."" This reflects the growing enthusiasm for high-end products and the increasing readiness of Indian consumers to splurge on exclusive and quality items.
As India’s affluent class continues to expand, it is clear that global luxury brands are positioning themselves for long-term growth in the country. The emergence of a younger, wealthier, and more aspirational population in India is offering a golden opportunity for luxury brands, who are not just targeting the traditional metro cities but are now looking at a pan-India footprint.
India’s luxury market is poised for a boom, driven by a convergence of rising wealth, increased spending on premium goods, and global brands’ willingness to invest in the country. The coming years will undoubtedly see India become an even more significant player in the global luxury retail landscape, as both international and domestic brands look to capitalise on the growing affluence of the Indian consumer.

CCPA issues notices to 17 direct selling firms over 'unfair practices',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ccpa-issues-notices-to-17-direct-selling-firms-over-unfair-practices/articleshow/116292785.cms,13-12-2024,"Consumer protection regulator
CCPA
on Friday said it has issued notices to 17

Oriflame India
, for alleged unfair trade practices and violations of
consumer protection rules
. The notices have been served on companies such as
Vihaan Direct Selling India
, Triptales Pvt Ltd, Oriens Global Marketing,
Zennesa Wellness
, and others for alleged service deficiencies and non-compliance with the Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules, 2021.
An official statement revealed that 13 of these cases are under investigation, while replies from three companies are still awaited.
The action comes in response to concerns about deceptive practices in the direct selling industry. The ministry warned that some fraudulent entities are misusing the direct selling model to promote illegal pyramid or money circulation schemes.
These companies often make unrealistic promises of high commissions, foreign trips, and entrepreneurship opportunities contingent on recruiting others.
""The government remains steadfast in its mission to create a fair, transparent, and consumer-friendly market ecosystem,"" the statement said.

Consumers have been advised to exercise caution by checking disclosures carefully, avoiding recruitment-based earnings, understanding return and refund policies, reading contracts thoroughly and verifying direct sellers' credentials.
The Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules, 2021, were introduced to regulate direct selling entities and protect consumer interests.
These rules complement other existing regulatory frameworks, including the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020, and the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011.
The
consumer affairs ministry
warned that such fraudulent practices violate consumer trust and expose individuals to potential financial risks.

Malls feel the chill as brands start winter sale early,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/malls-feel-the-chill-as-brands-start-winter-sale-early/articleshow/116262954.cms,13-12-2024,"New Delhi: Malls are concerned over some retailers making an early start to
end of season sale
(EOSS) this year instead of waiting for all brands to go on sale together.
Early start of sale impacts mall revenues as they tend to operate on a revenue-sharing model with retailers. Some retailers have started their respective sales even before the onset of peak winter, triggering some mall operators to write to the retailers requesting them to delay their sales.
Struggling for
revenue
and unsold inventory for six months, several brands started offering discounts at retail stores and online, fearing that further delay could shorten the shopping season, dimming their chances of liquidating stock.
""We have requested retailers to not start the EOSS in December as winter has just begun. We have also just concluded the Black Friday sale and some gap between two sales is preferred. We are hoping that EOSS is a big event and starts by January,"" said Pushpa Bector, senior executive director at DLF Retail, which runs premium malls in Delhi NCR.
Levis, Bata, Puma, Woodland, Wrangler, Biba, Adidas, Flipkart, Myntra, Nykaa Fashion, Shoppers Stop and Lifestyle are among brands and retailers who have started discounting online or in stores, or both.

""We think we are starting the EOSS on time; currently it is only for our loyal customers and from next week, the EOSS will be for everyone,"" said Devarajan Iyer, chief executive of department store chain Lifestyle International. ""Festive season was quite good and post that also, the growth has been in single digit. Some malls have approached us regarding the early EOSS but there is no such concern pan India.""
""India should follow the Dubai model where shopping festival with all brands on discount becomes a pulling factor. A customer should not go back empty-handed from the mall because the brand s/he was looking for was not on sale. Once all the brands go on sale together, the consumer would know whatever they will buy, will be on discount and can plan shopping accordingly,"" said Muhammad Ali, CEO-retail, Prestige Group.
EOSS usually starts around December 18-20 and ends in January.
The retail industry doesn't want to take any risk since winter was short last year and peaked only in January, that too for a brief period, creating panic in the industry to exhaust stock.
""The market had picked up during the festive season, but November has not been that good in terms of sales. Maybe that is the reason some brands might have started the EOSS early, though we are planning to start it in the third or fourth week of December as per usual practice,"" said Rajesh Jain, managing director and CEO of Lacoste India. ""Ideally, all brands should go on sale together and we retailers have discussed it many times, but every brand has their own guidelines and drivers.""
Industry executives said early discounts will also boost cash flow, since inventory for the spring-summer collection will start arriving at their warehouses later this month.
Retailers hope the early start to the end of season sales will push revenue by 8-12% year-on-year in December and January. During the just-concluded Black Friday sales, several retailers and brands reported brisk sales due to heavy discounts on offer.
""Some shoppers wait for the year-end sale and it is one of the biggest events in the shopping industry. That is why we try to coordinate with retailers to remain in sync. Some brands were worried about the winter, and we had a discussion with them that they should wait for some more time with inventory before putting it on sale,"" said Ravinder Choudhary, vice president at Vegas & Unity Group, which operates half a dozen malls in Delhi and Punjab.

"SC to hear CCI plea seeking transfer of Amazon, Flipkart cases to apex court or Delhi HC",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/sc-to-hear-cci-plea-seeking-transfer-of-amazon-flipkart-cases-to-apex-court-or-delhi-hc/articleshow/116240814.cms,12-12-2024,"The
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) on Thursday urged the
Supreme Court
to transfer a batch of 24 writ petitions pertaining to alleged
anti-competitive practices
by e-commerce giants
Amazon
and
Flipkart
, pending in various High Courts, either to itself or a single High Court.
A Bench led by Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna has agreed to list the matter early, with the case likely to come up for hearing on Friday.
The CCI has sought the transfer of these petitions preferably to the
Delhi High Court
, in order to expedite the adjudication as well as to minimise any scope of conflicting rulings on this issue.
The 24 petitions are filed across the High Courts of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, Karnataka and Allahabad, among others. They arise out of information filed by Delhi Vyapar Sangh alleging violations of Competition Act, 2002 by Amazon and Flipkart relating to sale and purchase of mobile phones.
The commission's investigation unit concluded in August that Amazon and Flipkart breached India's antitrust laws by favouring selected sellers on their websites. It also found that smartphone companies such as Samsung and Vivo broke those laws by colluding with the two e-commerce companies to exclusively launch products online.
Live Events
The investigation is a major regulatory challenge for Amazon and Flipkart in a market where e-commerce sales are set to exceed $160 billion by 2028, up from $57 billion to $60 billion in 2023.
Since the findings, almost two dozen lawsuits across five Indian high courts have been filed by some Amazon and Flipkart vendors, as well as by Samsung and Vivo, to block the investigation as they want to ""debilitate and scuttle"" the process, the commission said earlier.
Amazon and Flipkart have faced criticism from smaller retailers for years over their business practices, saying they have suffered due to deep discounts and preferential treatment meted out by the platforms.
A Reuters investigation in 2021, based on Amazon internal documents, found the company gave preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers and used them to bypass Indian laws.
The current commission investigation started back in 2020 but has faced many delays.

Winter end of season sales begin; brands running discounting in-store and online,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/winter-end-of-season-sales-begin-brands-running-discounting-in-store-and-online/articleshow/116141752.cms,09-12-2024,"The winter end of season sales have started even before the onset of full winter, with several brands running discounting in-stores and online as they fear the delayed start will shorten the season hitting them badly with unsold stock when consumer demand continues to remain soft.

,

, Flipkart, Myntra, Nykaa Fashion,
Shoppers Stop
and Lifestyle are some who have already started discounting in online or stores or both, coming days after the heavy discounting during the Black Friday weekend sale in end-November.
“Winter has become shorter and there is no point dragging inventory for a longer period,” said shoe and apparel brand Woodland India chief executive Harkirat Singh. The retailer started its sale earliest ever this year but Singh said discount is steep only on the slow sellers unlike previous two years when it was across the board.
End of season sale during winter usually would start around December 18-20th and end in January covering the Republic Day which is a big consumption period.
The industry doesn’t want to take risk since last year winter was short too and peaked only in January for a brief while which had created a panic in the industry to liquidate stock. Chief executives said early discounts will also help in cash flow since inventory for spring-summer collection will start arriving at their warehouses from later this month.

A senior executive with a leading apparel brand said it has started discounting online and stores for current season merchandise since consumers are not buying anything without discounts irrespective of the weather.
Retailers, however, are gung ho the early start to the end of season sales will push revenue by 8-12% year-on-year in December and January. During the just concluded Black Friday sales, several retailers and brands had reported brisk sales due to heavy discounting on offer.
Ravinder Choudhary, vice president-Vegas & Unity Group, which operates half a dozen malls in Delhi and Punjab, said some brands, who don’t have much inventory of winter wear, have started the sale early. “Even those with winter wear in stock were considering to start the sale early but the drop in temperature in the last two days have made them rethink the decision,” he said.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) earlier this month said India experienced its second warmest November in 123 years and the winter will be delayed in the North. The apex weather agency on Monday said there will be a gradual fall in minimum temperatures by 2-4? over Northwest, central & East India during next three days and thereafter no significant change.

Supreme Court
to hear legal challenges to an investigation of
Amazon
and Walmart's
Flipkart e-commerce
platforms, saying those challenges, filed by Samsung, Vivo and others at Indian high courts, were aiming to scuttle the probe.
In a filing on Dec. 3, reviewed by Reuters and not released publicly, the
Competition Commission of India
asked the court to hear 23 challenges, filed by Samsung, Vivo, and several vendors on the Amazon and Flipkart platforms, to enable the case to be decided quickly.
Amazon declined to comment, while Flipkart, Samsung, Vivo and the competition commission did not respond to requests for comment.
The investigation is a major regulatory challenge for Amazon and Flipkart in a market where e-commerce sales are set to exceed $160 billion by 2028, up from $57 billion to $60 billion in 2023.

The separate lawsuits, if allowed, ""will lead to absurdity since it will interfere with the flexibility of the (commission's) Director General to carry out investigation in any matter.""
Amazon and Flipkart have faced criticism from smaller retailers for years over their business practices, saying they have suffered due to deep discounts and preferential treatment meted out by the platforms.
Amazon and Flipkart deny any wrongdoing.

Zudio’s success story
Noel Tata-led
Trent
opened first independent Zudio store in FY18 and it has been a runaway success. It is now among the biggest apparel brands in the country. Since its inception in FY17 within Star stores, Zudio has seen considerable expansion.
Carved out as a separate format from Star Bazaar in FY18, the Zudio format now accounts for more than a third of Trent's total revenue, compared with 8% a few years ago. And it has been the fastest growing format for Trent, surpassing Westside in terms of store count in FY22 and in terms of revenue in FY24.
ALSO READ: Reliance Retail Q2 Results: Profit rises 1.3% YoY to Rs 2,836 crore, revenue declines by 3.5%
As of June this year, the company had 228 Westside stores, 559 Zudio stores and 36 stores across other lifestyle concepts. Despite multiple retailers operating in the value retailing segment for more than a decade, Zudio surpassed most of the existing players in terms of revenue as well as number of stores.
Trent reported a 50% surge in sales for 2023-24 to Rs 12,375 crore and a nearly fourfold jump in net profit to Rs 1,477 crore. Trent's consolidated revenue has increased at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 45%, most of it contributed by Zudio, which has surpassed revenue of Rs 7,000 crore in FY24 in yet another year of substantial growth.
Tata cracked the code, Reliance to follow
Zudio was able to crack the code of India's new consumer class which has come up in small towns. While growing disposable incomes have given it an appetite to spend, spread of internet and social media has made it fashion conscious.
ALSO READ: Reliance Retail's shutting down Centro outlets temporarily
Experts say India's consumption structure was skewed in the past over a narrow base of rich consumers accounting for a large chunk of the market, as per an ET report in October. However, as the economy is broadening across many more cities and the impact is reaching further down the income ladder, the opportunity for value formats and value brands is expanding.
Zudio has ridden to success on this expanding consumer market in India's small towns where people have now grown fashion conscious too. Marrying style with low price for the small-town buyer is the secret behind Zudio's success which is also backed by Tata, the name that has spelt quality for decades for a lot of Indians.
Zudio's success has been aided by an exclusive design portfolio and a low gross margin of 35-40%. This enables the company to achieve high store productivity, with a revenue per sq ft of Rs 16,300, which is twice the industry average.
Why Reliance needs Yousta
Reliance Industries
' retail division reported a gross revenue of Rs 76,302 crore in Q2, marking a 1.1% decline year-on-year. The growth was affected by weak demand in the fashion and lifestyle (F&L) segment, ongoing efforts to streamline operations, and a calibrated approach to the B2B business aimed at improving margins, according to the conglomerate's report.
Reliance aims to replicate Tata's success with Zudio through Yousta. RIL pumped about Rs 14,839 crore into Reliance Retail as debt last fiscal year to support its long-term investment plans. The funding, the largest by the parent in the last ten years, was routed as an inter-corporate deposit from the holding firm, Reliance Retail Ventures.
With Yousta, Reliance Retail aims to expand its portfolio by introducing new collections every week, while also offering daily unisex and character merchandise. This strategy mirrors Zudio's success, where frequent inventory refreshes have attracted more buyers, and its franchise model has helped reduce capital costs.

Top sportswear Companies' growth run slows after Covid highs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/top-sportswear-companies-growth-run-slows-after-covid-highs/articleshow/115946406.cms,04-12-2024,"Demand for sportswear from running shoes to joggers and yoga mats slowed down for leading firms such as
Puma
,
Adidas
,
Nike
,
Skechers
and
Asics
, halting their sprint since the easing of the Covid-19 pandemic when they doubled their sales in two years.
Sportswear firms have reported 1-25% year-on-year increase for 2023-24, down from 35-85% increase for the previous financial year, according to the latest regulatory filings. While demand for fitness wear and sports equipment for disciplines other than cricket grew as people prioritised health with the onset of Covid-19, consumers cut back on discretionary spends across categories over the past six to eight quarters.
Experts said companies capitalised on the popularity of more casual styles in the wake of the pandemic, a trend that has subsided now although people are more health conscious than ever. A broader slowdown, especially in cities, hurt premium categories including sportswear, which are completely dominated by global players.
“Sportswear or footwear has a slower replacement cycle than apparel and lifestyle products. Also, there is a distinct slowdown as it all comes down to income growth versus inflation. So, a longer term potential still remains for the segment but there is a short-term consumption stress,"" said Devangshu Dutta, founder of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight.
With a population of 1.4 billion, India is among the fastest growing and largest international markets for footwear companies and over the years companies such as
Under Armour
, Asics and Skechers have expanded aggressively in the country.

Black Friday buzz: Brands hope for a bit of BLACK MAGIC to lift sales
Puma India managing director Karthik Balagopalan said the category has outpaced market growth with mid to high single digit growth rates even as subdued demand has lagged expectations.
“When it comes to health and fitness, consumers continue to spend on performance products and our sports-first strategy also leans towards that. Our ambition continues to grow at or be above market CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over the mid-term, and we think we are in a good place with our back-end infrastructure, our product portfolio and pipeline, BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) readiness and our best-in-class team, who will continue to cement and retain our lead on competition,” he said.
In October, Foot Locker entered India through a long-term licensing agreement with
Metro Brands
, which will own and operate stores, while Nykaa Fashion will be its exclusive e-commerce partner.
However, there are challenges. In August this year, the government made it mandatory for footwear companies to obtain BIS certification for more than a dozen footwear products including sports brands. This impacted sales even last year as BIS had not issued licences to several foreign brands whose products were manufactured outside India, which in turn, forced brands to cut down on supplies.
American footwear firm Skechers said in its last earnings call that it had been growing exceptionally well in India for several years but there was a bit of an anomaly in part because of some of the regulatory changes that it had not yet fully responded to.
""We continue to work closely with both our India team and regulators to further advance our local sourcing strategy. We are seeing positive trends and remain optimistic about the progress in this important market. We see tremendous opportunity, not only in our lifestyle business, but also in performance,"" Skechers chief operating officer David Weinberg told analysts.

Luxury+1: Will Bulgari show brands the way from China to India?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/will-bulgari-or-bvlgari-show-brands-the-way-from-china-to-india-indias-luxury-brands-premium-products/articleshow/115930055.cms,03-12-2024,"Bulgari, or
Bvlgari
, the Italian maker of luxury jewellery, watches, fragrances, accessories, and leather goods, is looking at India to make up for falling demand in China.
Bulgari
is expanding its footprint in India to take advantage of strong growth and favorable demographics, Bulgari chief executive officer Jean Christophe Babin said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
In October, Bulgari announced the launch of its first digital boutique in India in partnership with Tata CLiQ Luxury. ""There are other promising markets for luxury, but the size and potential are a fraction of what India might become for western luxury,"" Babin had said in an interview. ""The luxury market has grown a lot over the last decade and, driven by China, the boom has been extraordinary,"" he said. ""But China has reached a certain maturity, and it is undergoing a slowdown which is related not only to oversupply in real estate, but an oversupply across the board. We will get out of it, but given the maturity and the demographics, China like many other territories will normalise to single-digit growth.""
After manufacturers such as Apple, it's now time for luxury brands to go for China+1. It is a businesses strategy being followed by Western companies wanting to diversify their operations beyond China after the covid disruption and rising geopolitical risks. India is one of the popular Plus One options for global giants. Bulgari's decision to bet on India to balance its China business can show the way to other global luxury brands to diversify into India or raise their bets on the country known for its recent boom in luxury spending.
Why is China's luxury market losing sheen?
Global luxury giants from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (Which owns Bulgari) to Kering SA (the owner of Gucci) saw their sales in China slump in the first nine months of this year as the economy struggled to recover from housing crisis. The Financial Times reported in July that luxury goods were being discounted at rates as high as 50 per cent in China. The discounts in the country are being offered primarily by aspirational brands such as
Versace
and Burberry, as China’s once-voracious middle-class consumers become more frugal, industry insiders and experts had told FT.
The value of some of the world’s best-known luxury companies plunged as Chinese consumers pulled back on spending, with even the most exclusive brands feeling the pain, CNN had reported in July. First-half sales at
Bernard Arnault
’s luxury powerhouse LVMH dropped 10% year over year in Asia excluding Japan, a region dominated by China. Europe’s top 10 luxury companies had lost $250 billion in market value since March, Reuters reported in July.
Live Events
The fall in luxury demand is part of the overall consumption slump in China. Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles' Day shopping festival, a popular event every November started by Alibaba in 2009, less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth.
Amid China's lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza. ""People are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,"" Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai told AP during the shopping extravaganza, also known as ""Double 11"", last month. ""Since October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.""
Besides the overall economic gloom, luxury brands in China face another growing challenge. Second-hand and grey markets for luxury goods are booming, as price hikes from luxury brands in a weak economy are prompting some shoppers to look for cheaper ways to buy them, deepening concerns for the likes of LVMH. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, reported a 3% fall in quarterly sales last week, undershooting estimates in its first decline in quarterly sales since the pandemic as demand in China and Japan weakened. Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo also reported a fall in quarterly revenue, hit by a slowdown in demand from China.
""The elephant in the room is that, in China, as long as price gaps (between China and other countries) exist, there is the opportunity for price sensitive consumers to go to the grey market,"" Max Piero, CEO of luxury intelligence consultancy Re-Hub, which tracks grey market luxury purchases in China, told Reuters in October.
The luxury grey market, estimated to be worth $57 billion a year, has been fuelled in recent years by the rise of platforms such as DeWu, where luxury products, often sourced overseas, are sold at discounts from 20% to over 50% to prices at Chinese flagship stores. Re-Hub estimates that sales across 48 brands on DeWu rose 19% year on year in the second quarter to more than 7 billion yuan ($984.4 million).
The second-hand luxury market in China - which includes platforms such as Plum, ZZER and Alibaba-owned Xianyu - has grown at a compound annual growth rate of over 30% since 2020, according to consultancy iResearch estimates, although Zhu personally thinks this year the sector as a whole in China is more likely to grow around 20% this year.
As China falls, India rises in luxury demand
Though urban consumption is down in India and rural consumption has just started recovering, demand for luxury has been on a constant upswing, especially after covid. That's why India could be a ready option for big luxury brands that see their business going down in China. And a lot of global luxury brands are already betting big on India.
As India’s economy expands, disposable incomes rise and the size of the affluent population grows, consumers are increasingly gravitating toward premium products and luxury brands. This trend, which accelerated during the pandemic, shows no signs of slowing down. From luxury cars to high-end beauty products, India’s affluent class is willing to spend on premium items that offer quality and exclusivity. This trend is also catching up in small towns where people are getting richer and are more willing to splurge on luxury.
India minted a new billionaire every five days in the last one year and took the total count of US dollar billionaires to cross the triple-century mark for the first time, as per the 2024 Hurun India Rich List which showed that India now has 334 billionaires by adding 75 compared to the last year.
Hurun India report found a total of 1,539 individuals in India with a wealth of at least Rs 1,000 crore. If Rs 5,000 crore is taken as the threshold, the rich list has 534 HNIs. ""Assuming that for every one Hurun rich lister we have found, we have probably missed two, India today likely has 5,000 individuals worth Rs 1,000 crore,"" Anas Rahman Junaid, Founder and Chief Researcher, Hurun India, said. The cumulative wealth of India's richest rose 46%, while average wealth has increased by 25%.
The list reflected the China-India gap. While China saw a 25% decline in its number of billionaires, India experienced a 29% increase.
McKinsey & Company has said in a recent report that India will be a focus for high-street fashion brands, as the players will look to Asian growth markets such as India for manufacturing. The main reason behind this phenomenon in China. The global consultancy firm said that China's economic deceleration, changing consumer preferences and the return of international travel are making growth in the country highly challenging, leading international fashion brands to look to other Asian markets.
The report added highlighting the opportunity in the luxury segment that India's population of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI), with over USD 30 million in assets, is expected to grow 50 percent from 2023 to 2028, making it the fastest-growing UHNWI population in the world. ""Aspirational customers, who make up about half of global luxury sales, are expected to grow from 60 million in 2023 to 100 million in 2027,"" it added.
In some luxury categories, India is already outperforming China. As per Simon Joseph, a senior luxury brand builder and consumer experience expert based in Zurich, India's rising affluent class is fuelling a surge in high-end spirits sales, with Scotch whisky and fine wines registering double-digit growth, outpacing consumption rates in the US and China. Joseph told PTI in September, ""One subcategory where India surpasses China and is growing at double the rate of the USA over a five-year CAGR is Scotch luxury whisky.""

"₹2 shampoo, ₹5 biscuit packs: Magic price tags no longer cast a spell on shoppers",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/magic-price-tags-no-longer-cast-a-spell-on-shoppers/articleshow/115875402.cms,02-12-2024,"Mumbai: Indians are shifting away from
daily essentials
and grocery products with price tags of ₹5 and in many cases ₹10, often called popular or magic
price points
, an indication of consumers upgrading their shopping basket or opting for larger packs that offer them more
grammage
for every rupee spent.
In several categories including noodles, chocolates, detergents, toothpaste, soaps and dishwash, contribution especially of ₹5 packs has fallen over the past four years while it has stagnated in biscuits, according to latest data by Kantar. Under ₹2 shampoo, however, is an exception, and saw its share expanding as people buy sachets in bulk especially in rural markets.
""We are witnessing the emergence of ₹15 to ₹25 price points, reflecting a broader trend of upgradation across fast moving consumer goods categories. Consumers across all segments are increasingly looking for value across various price points, suggesting a shift towards higher grammage and premium options even during inflationary times,"" said Neeraj Khatri, chief executive, Wipro Consumer Care.
These price points typically do not bring in high volume into the brand or category, but instead help in new households through accessible pricing even for premium brands. However, ₹5 packs, that historically dominated most of the category, are becoming passe as households prefer 'larger' small packs, say experts.
""These price point packs are generally viewed as penetration packs, and therefore, there is a certain case to be made that the ₹10 pack is gradually becoming a key penetration pack for the marketers. However, given the fact they induce trials, and are stepping stones to larger packs in the category, they are not generally viewed as packs that can drive consumption,"" said K Ramakrishnan, managing director, South Asia, worldpanel division at Kantar.
Live Events
To be sure, ₹5 and ₹10 packs account for nearly two-thirds of noodles, detergent bars, dishwashers and biscuits, a third in chocolates while the price points contribute to 83% in shampoos. Several companies also retain these price points while increasing price tags through reduction of grammages, referred to
shrinkflation
. For instance, consumers spent 19% more for buying daily essentials, groceries and household products in FY24 compared to a two-year ago period.
""The ₹10 is kind of becoming the lowest put-down price barring maybe shampoo sachets. I don't see us wanting to go further than in the short run. People are moving to ₹20 and there's a steady movement as the quantum of toothpaste in ₹10 is not sufficient enough,""
Colgate-Palmolive India
managing director Prabha Narasimhan said.
Sales contributions of these low unit packs (LUP), especially ₹5, have fallen despite them reaching a far higher number of households now compared to 2020, said Kantar.
Hindustan Unilever
, India's biggest consumer goods firm, said such LUPs account for a third of its mass-products portfolio and consumers even use these packs for special occasions in premium segments. ""We want our products to be accessible in affordable pricing or unit sizes that allow consumers to occasionally use those products en masse. Only we as a company can do because we have the reach, the ability and the brands that we can make available at arm's length in every part of this country,"" Rohit Jawa, managing director at Hindustan Unilever, told ET last month.

"Retailers, brands see record business at Black Friday weekend sales on back of discounts, marketing",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-brands-see-record-business-at-black-friday-weekend-sales-on-back-of-discounts-marketing/articleshow/115869390.cms,01-12-2024,"Heavy discounts and marketing efforts drove record business for this year's
Black Friday weekend sales
which top
retailers
and
brands
said was almost 70-80% of what they would achieve during big shopping periods like Republic and Independence Day sales. Chief executives said this helped companies to liquidate most of their unsold festive season stock.
Departmental store chain Lifestyle International CEO Devarajan Iyer said
Black Friday sales
have been pretty good and a lot of stock has been liquidated. He said the company achieved almost 70-75% sales of what it does during Republic and Independence Days.
“There was a double digit year-on-year sales growth in our stores except those in Tamil Nadu and Telangana where the cyclone impacted store operations during the weekend. This pulled down the overall company growth rate to single digit,” he said.
Marketers said the high discounts this year drove sales.
""Indian consumers love discounts. While discounts have been commonplace nowadays, deep discounts offered during the
Black Friday
sales created an incentive for consumers to come out to buy something since they have been deferring their demand for a while now,"" said Santosh Desai, a social commentator and brand expert.

Leading electronic retail chain Vijay Sales director Nilesh Gupta said it too recorded 75-80% of the business it achieves during big shopping days.
“There were discounts on smartphones during Black Friday which as a category instantly drives sales. Televisions and appliance sales too were brisk. Brands undertook heavy marketing which had a positive rub-off effect. In 1-2 years, Black Friday can be as big as Republic or Independence Day sales in India,” he said.
There was good footfall in the malls during the weekend as top brands such as H&M, Levi’s, Skechers, Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, Puma and Adidas rolled out heavy discounts across most of their merchandise.
“The Black Friday sales were a hit this weekend. Footfall and sales went up by 30-40% in many brands compared to last year's sales. We are hoping that with this weekend consumption buoyancy will return back,” said Pushpa Bector, senior executive director and business head at DLF Retail, which owns many malls in North India.
An executive at a prominent apparel brand said discounts of up to 70% on platforms like Amazon and Myntra drove higher sales online compared to physical stores. Even luxury brands such as Michael Kors, Coach, Guess, Swarovski and Tommy Hilfiger were being sold on discounts of up to 70%.
A lot more brands participated in this year’s Black Friday sales which started last Friday and continued till the weekend with some even extending it to Monday. Black Friday has traditionally been a big sale period in the West which starts the shopping season for Christmas. In India, marketers have been trying to develop it as a property to push sales after Diwali which has always been a lull period.
Most brands and retailers matched the scale of discounts during Black Friday to that of Independence Day and Republic Day which are big revenue grossers. Executives said this was because they were trying to clear unsold inventory after the festive season.
This year’s festive season was an average one with a sudden deceleration in urban demand reported by brands in the past two quarters even though rural consumer sentiments have been improving. Brands reported brisk demand mainly for premium products such as cars, smartphones, apparel, refrigerators and televisions. While premium products sales grew in double digits, demand for mass products was weak limiting overall festive sales growth to single digit.

Black Friday buzz: Brands hope for a bit of BLACK MAGIC to lift sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/black-friday-frenzy-brands-hope-for-a-bit-of-black-magic-to-lift-sales/articleshow/115826916.cms,30-11-2024,"New Delhi | Kolkata: After an average
Diwali sales
season, companies selling cosmetics, shoes, apparel, electronics and premium packaged foods are trying to liquidate stock by leveraging the
Black Friday
frenzy that is slowly making its way into India.
Brands and retailers are offering discounts up to 50% at physical stores and on ecommerce platforms to push demand. Black Friday this year also coincides with salary payouts, which is prompting companies to sweeten deals to encourage consumers to spend.
“Consumer demand during the year was not wow. But we believe Black Friday will create another occasion for consumption aided by good weather in the North,” said Pushpa Bector, senior executive director and business head at DLF Retail that owns several malls in North India.
Nykaa
, Myntra, Blinkit,
Amazon
, Tata Cliq, Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, Puma, H&M, Adidas, Levi’s and Skechers are among brands and platforms pushing
Black Friday sales
Black Friday, a concept originated in the US, is observed the day after celebrating Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November. It is usually the busiest shopping day of the year in the US with businesses trying to clear unsold inventories before the year-end at significant discounts and promotions. In India, where it is a recently started trend, it is seen as an extension of the festive season sale events.
Electronics retail chain Vijay Sales director Nilesh Gupta said Black Friday is an effort by retailers and brands to liquidate unsold stock after Diwali, with discounts this year matching that of big sales events like Republic Day and Independence Day. ""However, businesswise Black Friday is 2x of a usual day as compa red to 4-5x during Republic and Independence Day which are also public holidays,” he said. “Every year, Black Friday as a sales event is becoming bigger with more and more retailers joining in.

We expect in another couple of years it will be as big as the big shopping days."" During the month-long festive sales which culminated with Diwali, brands and retailers said demand was brisk mainly for premium products such as cars, smartphones, apparel, refrigerators and televisions. While sales of premium products grew in double digits from a year earlier, demand for mass products was weak, limiting overall sales growth to marginal. Ecommerce platform Amazon said it is running its first Black Friday event in India, starting November 29 to December 2, with deals on Apple, Samsung, Sony, Nike, Calvin Klein, Adidas,
Tommy Hilfiger
,
Panasonic
and Swarovski products among others.
Discounts would be 40-75% on mobile phones, electronics, luxury handbags and large-pack products such as tea and chyawanprash. The Black Friday event is a reflection of “the huge appetite that Indian customers have for value”, Saurabh Srivastava, vice-president, categories, at Amazon India said in a statement.
""With value offers around Black Friday, brands across beauty and personal care, watches and wearables, women’s western wear, men’s casual wear, sports footwear and luxe, have been seeing strong traction,” a Myntra spokesperson said.
While companies like Amazon are holding the event over several days till December 2 or 3, some others are structuring it as a one-day sale on November 29.

NCLAT dismisses plea seeking insolvency against Amazon Wholesale,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/nclat-dismisses-plea-seeking-insolvency-against-amazon-wholesale/articleshow/115704938.cms,26-11-2024,"New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has set aside a petition seeking to initiate
insolvency proceedings
against
Amazon Wholesale
(India). A three-member
NCLAT
bench upheld the order passed by the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT), which had in March this year dismissed the insolvency plea filed by
Multiplier Brand Solutions
.
Multiplier Brand Solutions had filed the plea under Section 9 of the Insolvency &
Bankruptcy
Code. It had alleged a default of Rs 3.7 crore for eight invoices raised between March 2023 and May 2023.
However, rejecting it, NCLAT said the ""claim of Appellant for
payment
of invoices which are the subject matter of Section 9 Application was disputed much before Demand Notice was issued"".
The appellate tribunal further said: ""The adjudicating authority (NCLT) has not committed any error in refusing to initiate CIRP, there being pre-existing dispute which is reflected with the correspondence which took place between the parties much prior to issuance of demand notice.""
Multiplier Brand Solutions had entered into a novation and substitution agreement with
Amazon Seller Services
and
Amazon
Wholesale (India) and provided its services.

It had raised invoices amounting to Rs 3.69 crore from March 2023 to May 2023. However, the amount was disputed by Amazon.
Later claiming default over the said invoices, Multiplier Brand Solutions approached the Delhi bench of NCLT.
This was opposed by Amazon which submitted the existence of a dispute regarding the amount claimed by the operational creditor before the issuance of the demand notice.
Agreeing to this, NCLT rejected the plea. However, it said it was not expressing any opinion on entitlement or the claim raised by the petitioner on the corporate debtor.
This order was challenged by Multiplier Brand Solutions in April this year before the appellate tribunal, NCLAT.

SC dismisses UP govt's appeal against Allahabad HC's Flipkart tax order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/sc-dismisses-up-govts-appeal-against-allahabad-hcs-flipkart-tax-order/articleshow/115703605.cms,26-11-2024,"The
Supreme Court
on Tuesday dismissed the Uttar Pradesh government’s appeal against a
Allahabad High Court
’s December order that quashed tax reassessment proceedings initiated after the limitation period against
Flipkart India

A Bench comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Justice R. Mahadevan said that that reassessments for 2012-13 which were concluded exparte were time-barred and limitation cannot be extended at a belated stage. “The (Allahabad) High Court is justified in invoking writ jurisdiction as per the facts of the case,” it said while rejecting the state government and its revenue department’s appeal against the HC's December 13 order.
The HC while ruling in favour of the assessee had held that the powers exercised to reopen and extend limitation for carrying out assessment against

The state government told the SC that the HC had failed to take into consideration the relevant provisions of law which proved that the condition of ""recording reasons to believe"" was not a requirement for initiating reassessment proceedings under Section 29(7) of the Act. The reassessment can be initiated under Section 29(7) even for a ""change of opinion"", the UP government stated.
While challenging the validity of reassessment proceedings initiated by the state revenue authorities, Flipkart had argued that the limitation period to make a regular assessment had expired on September 30, 2016, thus the revenue could not have reopened the assessment on the grounds that it had ""reason to believe"" that any part of the company's turnover had escaped assessment. In the absence of any assessment under Section 28, in terms of provisions of Section 27 of the Act, the self-assessment of Flipkart is the deemed assessment for the purpose of the Act, it said. Counsel Kishore Kunal represented Flipkart in the SC.

Uniqlo plans to expand production and sourcing in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/uniqlo-plans-to-expand-production-and-sourcing-in-india/articleshow/115556836.cms,22-11-2024,"Japanese clothing retailer
Uniqlo
plans to expand production and sourcing in India to meet global demand. The company currently sources 15.5% of its products for Indian stores locally.
""For our India stores, we are sourcing about 15.5% of our requirements locally but the share is higher for exports and the strategy is to keep sourcing more,"" said Kenji Inoue, Uniqlo India's COO and CFO, in an interview to ToI.
Items like T-shirts and heattech clothing are already being sourced from India for Uniqlo's global stores. Inoue believes India's growing middle class and their demand for quality products makes it a key market for the brand.

Uniqlo, which has primarily focused on North India, is now expanding its presence in cities like Mumbai. The company, however, emphasizes quality over rapid expansion. ""We are not rushing to get into new cities. The focus is more on product mix and quality,"" said Inoue.
Uniqlo India has experienced significant financial growth. Its revenue increased by 31% year-on-year, reaching Rs 814.8 crore in FY24. Profits also rose to Rs 85 crore, according to data from market intelligence platform

The Indian unit of Asia’s biggest clothing brand posted a net profit of Rs 85.1 crore for the year ended March 2024 with net revenues of Rs 824 crore, according to its latest filing with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).

The company, which has opened its largest store in Mumbai, said finding good real estate has been a challenge.
“We don't compromise, we want to have the best space, which is visible. And we need a huge floor space in order to achieve what we want to showcase,” the executive said.
Uniqlo India had posted a profit of Rs 68.1 crore with sales of Rs 625 crore in the previous year. Its on-year revenue growth was 69% in FY23 and 64% in FY22.
The company is also expanding its manufacturing capability.
“We are accelerating make India. We are expanding and the ratio of what we selling in India, which is manufactured in India is about 18-20% but the majority of
make in India
is being exported. There's a lot of space for acceleration of the growth of make in India as well, and that's what we are aiming,” Inoue said.
Uniqlo opened its first door in the country in September 2019, but lockdowns and other constraints during the Covid-19 pandemic delayed its store expansion plans.
As the world’s second most-populated country, India is an attractive market for apparel brands, especially with youngsters increasingly embracing western-style clothing.
Uniqlo is globally popular for functional basics like T-shirts, jeans and woollen wear, unlike fast-fashion rivals which are associated with designs that move quickly from the catwalk to the showroom.

'Online platforms changing buying pattern among urban consumers',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/online-platforms-changing-buying-pattern-among-urban-consumers/articleshow/115499475.cms,21-11-2024,"Online platforms have changed the buying patterns of consumers who, especially in the metro cities, have shifted “from top-up to stock-up purchases”, said
Kanaka Bhagwat
, head of ecommerce at retail market tracker
NielsenIQ
.
“Quick commerce and ecommerce sales are in high gear, having grown 30% year-on-year over the last five quarters,” she told ET in an interview, attributing the trend to consumers looking for convenience and assortment.
Sales volume of
ready-to-eat foods
topped growth on e-commerce channels, expanding 52% in MAT September 2024 compared to 2023.Sales of salty snacks and refined edible oils grew 41% each, followed by biscuits (40%) and packaged atta (39%), Bhagwat said.
Large FMCG companies including
Nestle
,
ITC
,
Hindustan Unilever
,
Dabur
and
Emami
have called out high double-digit growth, especially in large cities, on quick-commerce platforms such as Zomato-owned Blinkit,
Swiggy
Instamart, Zepto, Big Basket’s BBNow and Flipkart Minutes, in their recent earnings calls. FMCG executives have stated that unlike previously, consumers are now opting to buy even monthly purchases — or bulk packs of 5 kg or 10 kg — mainly of staples like rice, edible oils and atta, on quick-commerce platforms, driven by convenience.
In the quarter ended September 2024,
quick commerce
and ecommerce contributed 85% to the incremental sales in metro markets, which is a significant shift from the corresponding quarter last year when offline channels accounted for 85% of the incremental sales with ecommerce contributing 15%.

“This dramatic shift in just one year highlights the growing dominance of ecommerce in the metro markets,” Bhagwat said.
While traditional trade, or neighbourhood kirana stores, continue to contribute about 85% to FMCG sales nationally, in urban markets, the transition to quick commerce is escalating rapidly. This has led to companies such as Dabur and Nestle stating that they are correcting inventory in general trade channels.
For Nestle, maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe coffee, ecommerce sales hit a seven-year high in the July-September quarter, contributing 8.3% to the company’s overall domestic sales, of which quick commerce channels accounted for 50%.
“Traditional trade continues to have strong relevance. But when we move closer to metros, it’s quick commerce and ecommerce that are in high gear,” Bhagwat said.
India has about 13 million kirana stores where FMCG products are distributed.
Quick-commerce platforms are now diversifying to deliver apparel, durables, smart phones, footwear and jewellery within 10 minutes to customer’s doorsteps, replicating the FMCG model. However, asked if categories like apparel or durables can record such growth, Bhagwat said: “Unlike FMCG, a Fabindia or Manyavar fall in the basket of planned purchases and are large-ticket buys, so whether a market for these categories can sustain on quick commerce or how big they can grow, is something we’ll have to wait and watch for.”
According to a report by Redseer Strategy Consultants, India’s quick-commerce market will reach $6 billion this fiscal year through March 2025, growing in the range of 75-85%. This, the report noted, is being driven by an additional 5 million new monthly transacting users and a projected increase of 20% in spending per monthly transaction.

Sources indicated that Reliance has not yet decided on a successor for the Managing Director position. For now, a leadership team comprising senior executives will oversee the company’s operations. The team includes Vikas Tandon, senior vice-president of luxury retail; Dinesh Taluja, chief financial officer of RRVL; Prateek Mathur, head of corporate strategy for Reliance Retail; and Sumeet Yadav, group vice-president of RBL, who has been with the company since its inception.
The evolving retail landscape in India, driven by a growing appetite for premium brands and unique consumer experiences, presents both opportunities and challenges. Despite its strong market presence, Reliance Brands reported widened losses of ₹288.4 crore in FY24, compared to ₹185 crore in FY23.
Mehta’s departure marks the end of an era for Reliance Brands, as the company navigates a competitive retail environment while continuing to build its luxury and premium portfolio under the interim leadership of its core executive team.

Market share of Kirana stores gradually shifting to Quick Commerce: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/market-share-of-kirana-stores-gradually-shifting-to-quick-commerce-report/articleshow/115470437.cms,20-11-2024,"The market share of traditional
Kirana stores
in India is steadily declining as
quick commerce
platforms are gaining market share, according to a report by Datum.
The report revealed that Kirana stores' market share fell from 95 percent in 2018 to 92.6 percent in 2023 and is projected to drop further to 88.9 per cent by 2028. This shift highlights the growing preference of consumers for
online grocery shopping
.
The report predicted a 74 per cent growth in the quick commerce segment in 2024, making it the fastest-growing retail channel during the 2023-28 period. With a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 48 per cent, quick commerce is poised to revolutionize the grocery market.
It said ""Quick commerce is expected to increase the channel shift from Kirana to online grocery"".
The impact on Kirana stores is significant, as per the report, 46 per cent of quick commerce users have reduced purchases from Kirana stores.
Live Events
Over 82 per cent of the buyers have shifted at least 25 per cent of their purchases from kirana stores to quick commerce platforms.
The data also noted that the survey reveals that 5 per cent of the respondents have completely stopped buying from kirana srores.
It says ""Prior to the advent of quick commerce, Kirana stores were the primary destination for unplanned grocery purchases due to their convenient locations and flexible operating hours"".
It also mentioned that an estimated USD 1.28 billion worth of Kirana sales is expected to move to quick commerce platforms in 2024, accounting for 21 percent of the latter's total sales.
The reason for the rise of the quick commerce platforms as per the report that the quick commerce offsets traditional retail's high channel costs by eliminating intermediaries and replacing them with streamlined delivery systems.
As long as delivery costs remain lower than savings from channel consolidation, these platforms can offer competitive prices, further eroding Kirana stores' dominance.
This shift highlights the challenges faced by Kirana stores in adapting to changing consumer behaviour, driven by convenience, speed, and cost-effectiveness offered by quick commerce.

"Marriages and shopping in Oct-Dec may spur 40% hike in spends, boost retail demand",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/marriages-and-shopping-in-oct-dec-may-spur-40-hike-in-spends-boost-retail-demand/articleshow/115462297.cms,20-11-2024,"MUMBAI: Marriages and shopping is a match made in heaven. Retailers and brands are expecting one to translate to the other — and see better numbers in the second half of this financial year on the back of the big fat Indian wedding. There are 47 auspicious days for tying the knot during October-March, more than three times the number of such days in the first half.
That’s about 4.8 million weddings during just October-December, generating business worth nearly Rs 6 lakh crore, according to Confederation of All India Traders (
CAIT
), which surveyed businesses dealing with wedding-related goods and services across 75 cities. This is over 35% higher than 3.5 million such occasions last year, cue for a potential 40% increase in spending.
Sustained Shopping Likely
Some of this buoyancy would be in line with expectations, as this season does impact sales positively. Retailers, after a tough few months, are preparing to cash in.
“Despite urban stress, our bill size is already higher than last year, with more marriages and shoppers, which clearly indicates a revival in the wedding segment,” said
Sunil Kataria
, chief executive of
Raymond Lifestyle
. “Since we have more dates spread across five months, instead of fewer dates clubbed together a year ago, there will surely be a sustained demand momentum for the next few months.”
Live Events
Parthip Thyagarajan
, cofounder of
WeddingSutra
, a nuptial services directory provider, feels there is heightened pressure and awareness, with social media documenting everything that is worn. “The number of functions have increased, even if it's an intimate wedding. The middle class —that mostly had Bollywood as reference —has enough style inspiration from the Ambani wedding to actors’ paparazzi pictures.”
Rahul Mishra
, an Indian designer who has a joint venture with
Reliance Retail
, sees demand as nuanced.“We will see more discretionary spending, rather than splurging across the board,” he said. “It will be more about smart spending, by being more focussed on the bride and groom, for example.”

Many schools have shifted classes online while offices have implemented work-from-home arrangements due to pollution. Consequently, consumers are increasingly opting for online orders to reduce the need to step outside. ""Earlier, I used to deliver 30-35 orders a day, but now it's gone up to 45-50,"" said a delivery partner working at Zepto. At night, deliveries take 5 to 10 minutes longer than usual because of the smog, he added.

ED uncovers Amazon and Flipkart's direct links with sellers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ed-uncovers-amazon-and-flipkarts-direct-links-with-sellers/articleshow/115426061.cms,19-11-2024,"The
Enforcement Directorate
(ED) has found “direct links” between the
e-commerce giants
Amazon and
Flipkart
and their
preferred sellers
, people in the know told ET.
The federal agency, investigating alleged foreign investment law violations, has quizzed the “top” five sellers of both
Amazon
and Flipkart and discovered that most of them are “directly related” to the e-commerce giants.
“The investigation (under
FEMA
) has revealed that most of their preferred sellers are either their former employees or kin of former associates/employees of Amazon and Flipkart,” a government official told ET on the condition of anonymity.
The agency has recovered “significant email dumps” from the sellers of Amazon and Flipkart who were recently quizzed. “A scrutiny of certain emails establishes the direct control of the ecommerce giants over their preferred sellers,” another government official told ET.
ET Bureau
Live Events
""Both ecommerce giants refused comment. Neither Amazon nor Flipkart has received any summons or correspondence from ED so far"".
Besides perusing the emails between the preferred sellers of Amazon and Flipkart, the agency has also gathered evidence to establish that from “warehouses to inventory to profit margins,” almost everything is under “direct control” of Amazon and Flipkart.
Sample this: the agency quizzed a preferred seller of one of the e-commerce giants. His questioning revealed that while the seller’s annual turnover ran into over a few thousand crores, his annual profit was merely Rs 20 lakhs. The said seller in question lives in a two-room apartment.
“The gaping difference between his annual turnover and his profit margins are appalling. This only goes on to indicate that the profit margins are also controlled by them (Amazon and Flipkart)”, the official added.
The agency’s investigation has further revealed that even the accounts (bank statements) of preferred sellers are prepared and monitored by the officials of Amazon and Flipkart.
The agency has also found flaws in the “Just in time” (JIT) model of stock gathering by e-commerce giants. The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) law stipulates making a strong market place where everyone including the small-time retailers can sell their products. But by controlling the inventory, stock, warehouses, profit margins and auditors of their sellers they (Amazon and Flipkart) have infringed
FDI rules
by reducing the marketplace into a multi brand sale platform only for their own gains”, the official added.
ET has learnt that the federal agency will file its final complaint against Amazon and Flipkart under FEMA for allegedly violating FDI rules before the adjudicating authority within three months.
Before that, the agency will quiz top officials of Amazon and Flipkart. “The evidence gathered so far and the questioning of preferred sellers is being examined after which their (Amazon and Flipkart) officials will be summoned for questioning,” the official told ET.
According to the procedure, after filing of the complaint the adjudicating authority will issue show cause notice to the e-commerce giants and decide on whether to impose penalty against them under FEMA.
The ED, which had been scrutinising the business practices of the duo for years, had virtually hit a legal roadblock after the two companies received orders in their favour from the courts.
The agency had been wanting to lay its hands on the
email dumps
between the two companies and their sellers. Hit by orders from the court, the agency decided to shift its focus on the sellers of Amazon and Flipkart so that the said email dumps can be retrieved from the sellers.
As a result, the ED earlier this month carried out raids on sellers associated with Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart. The pan-India operation included searches at seller locations and Amazon and Flipkart subsidiaries across major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. The raids spanned 19 locations in India.
The raid followed findings from India’s antitrust body that concluded both Amazon and Flipkart, along with some of their sellers, violated competition laws by favouring specific sellers. Both companies have consistently claimed adherence to Indian regulations.
Amazon's biggest seller in India, Appario, was also reportedly among those raided earlier this month. The ED sleuths inspected financial books and questioned executives about their dealings with the e-commerce giants.

, an official statement said on Monday. The
Government e-Marketplace
(GeM) is an online platform that facilitates end-to-end procurement of goods and services by various central, state ministries, departments, organisations, public sector undertakings, panchayats, and cooperatives.
The online portal was established with a clear objective to eliminate cumbersome and archaic manual public procurement processes that were riddled with inefficiencies and transparency-related issues.
GeM is onboarding the Indian sellers and service providers by conducting an extensive registration drive at its pavilion at the India International Trade Fair (IITF), the commerce ministry said.
The government's procurement through the portal has crossed Rs 3 lakh crore so far this financial year.
Higher buying activities by various ministries and departments have helped in reaching the figure.
Live Events
In 2023-24, the portal handled procurement of Rs 4 lakh crore by government departments of centres, states and public sector enterprises.
The portal was launched on August 9, 2016, for online purchases of goods and services by all central government ministries and departments.
South Korea's KONEPS is the largest such platform in the world. GeM stands at the second position. It is followed by Singapore's GeBIZ.

The remaining shares held by the founders were fully acquired by The Good Glamm Group over the last two years, wrapping-up the 100 per cent acquisition, according to a release.
The latest announcement comes on the heels of the Group completing the Sirona transaction and its increases in shareholding in other portfolio brands

According to the release, key functions of The Moms Co have been integrated into The Good Glamm Group's operations, over the past three years.
""After leading the business for a year post-acquisition, the founders stepped down from day-to-day roles last year, transitioning full control to Good Glamm Group's central teams.

How well-heeled Indians shrugged off inflation this festive season,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/how-well-heeled-indians-shrugged-off-inflation-this-festive-season/articleshow/115356531.cms,16-11-2024,"Well-off Indian consumers carried on with their festive spending spree even as even as ordinary shoppers were forced to kept their purse strings tight during this year's sale season owing to sticky
inflation
, ToI reported on November 16 citing latest data.
Expensive watches and gadgets were popular purchases this years, even as many people cut back on spending, said the report (by Asmita Dey). Companies like Titan saw big growth in sales of their high-end products.
""We also witnessed healthy volume growth of 27% (for watches), clearly indicating that consumer appetite for premium timepieces remains robust despite inflationary pressures,” ToI's report said quoting Rahul Shukla, a Titan executive.
Titan reported a 34% rise in sales value for the festive period, with watches priced above Rs 50,000 doing particularly well. Other companies like Godrej Appliances also reported similar trends.
Their sales grew by 50% as buyers opted for premium appliances like high-end washing machines and air conditioners.
Live Events
TNN
Experts believe that rising prices have made everyday essentials more expensive, impacting how much people with lower incomes can spend on non-essential items. This is reflected in slower overall retail sales growth compared to the past two years.
However, there is hope that the upcoming wedding season will boost sales across different price points. Budget-friendly smartphones and appliances have already seen increased demand.
Analysts predict around 4.8 million weddings in November and December, potentially leading to increased spending in the coming months.

India's e-commerce battlefield gets ready for bloody wars,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indias-e-commerce-amazon-flipkart-get-ready-for-bloody-wars-against-quick-commerce-swiggy-zomato-zepto-big-basket-blinkit-kirana-stores-in-threat/articleshow/115292656.cms,14-11-2024,"The
Swiggy IPO
is making news for being the most successful in a decade in its category. The food and grocery delivery firm yesterday listed at a 5.6% premium to its IPO price of Rs 390, making it the first company with an issue size of over Rs 10,000 crore in the past decade to have listed above its offer price, ET has reported. The stock closed 17% above its issue price at Rs 455.95 in a weak market, surpassing analysts’ expectations of a tepid debut. The company’s market capitalisation at close on Wednesday was Rs 1.02 lakh crore.
Swiggy's impressive debut also indicates the incoming deluge of cash in an emerging business, quick commerce.
Swiggy
plans to plough more cash into its quick-commerce business, Swiggy Instamart. Swiggy's bigger rival, Zomato, is also planning to fatten its war chest. Zomato plans to raise fresh funds through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) despite sitting on $1.5 billion, or about Rs 12,600 crore. The money will also fuel its quick commerce business, Blinkit. Zepto, another quick commerce player, is also raising money. ET reported last month that Zepto is in talks to raise $100-150 million from a group of domestic family offices and wealthy individuals. It last raised $340 million in August. Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto are the top three players with over 85% market share.
The floodgates of capital opening into the quick commerce sector would worry the big e-commerce platforms which have already started feeling the heat from quick commerce.
The quick rise of quick commerce
While quick commerce becomes the preferred medium for immediate needs and impulse purchases, e-commerce is favoured for more planned purchases like home, beauty and personal care. But now quick commerce firms are diversifying beyond groceries, small-value items, etc. and invading the home turf of e-commerce players.
Live Events
Quick commerce is already conquering kirana, the neighbourhood small retail business, as well as hitting modern retail. As consumer preferences shift towards the convenience of last-minute grocery deliveries, quick commerce companies are outpacing traditional retailers, with 46 per cent of consumers surveyed reporting a cut in purchases from Kirana shops, a recent report has said. The quick commerce market size is expected to reach $40 billion by 2030, a jump from $6.1 billion in 2024, according to the report by Datum Intelligence.
Quick-commerce operators such as Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto are aggressively trying to lure away consumers from large ecommerce platforms like Amazon and
Flipkart
by matching their prices across groceries and fast-selling general merchandise, triggering a price war in the home delivery space, ET reported a few months ago. This is a departure from the earlier pricing strategy of quick-commerce players who typically charged 10-15% premium over average ecommerce marketplace prices for instant deliveries, industry executives had told ET.
A recent ET study of prices of 30 commonly used products in daily necessities, discretionary groceries and other categories, including electronics and toys, in both ecommerce and quick-commerce platforms reveal the pricing disparity has been bridged. ""The pricing premium which quick commerce used to charge for instant deliveries is gone with these platforms now joining a race with large ecommerce to offer competitive pricing to shift consumer loyalties,"" B Krishna Rao, senior category head at biscuits major Parle Products had told ET.
The increasing competition is putting pressure on ecommerce majors to reduce delivery time.
""Price matching by quick commerce is to acquire market share and is part of market acquisition cost even when it might not be profitable at a per unit transaction level,"" Devangshu Dutta, CEO of consulting firm Third Eyesight, had told ET. ""They may have to sacrifice margins in the short term to get customers shopping more frequently.""
After challenging kirana and modern retail, e-commerce is the next frontier for quick commerce companies.
The challenge shaping up for e-commerce giants
With Swiggy, Zomato and Zepto raising a huge amount of money, the war between quick commerce and e-commerce is likely to turn bloody, besides increasing internecine competition among quick commerce players themselves.
Quick commerce, which began with the delivery of groceries and essential items, has now expanded to include a diverse range of products. This includes electronics, clothing, cosmetics, household goods, medicines, pet supplies, books, sporting equipment, and more.
E-commerce sector offers a vast opportunity for growth of quick commerce business. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $325 billion in 2030, as per Deloitte’s report released on Monday. This huge potential is luring big players. The Tata group’s ecommerce venture Neu is set to enter the quick commerce segment branded as Neu Flash, rolling it out to select users selling grocery, electronics and fashion, ET reported last month. Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance, leveraging its vast network of supermarkets, is expanding into the 10–30 minute delivery segment. Ambani wants to ensure quick commerce helps bolster its business ahead of an IPO of Reliance Retail, which was last year valued at $100 billion, and has backers including KKR, sources told Reuters recently.
Besides entry of big ones like Tata and Ambani, the deluge of fresh investment into business by the incumbents such as Swiggy, Blinkit and Zepto will pose a big threat to large e-commerce players Amazon and Flipkart. Swiggy has recently hired two Flipkart executives to boost its senior leadership. They have joined two other executives that Bengaluru-based Swiggy had hired from the Walmart-owned ecommerce major in the past few months.
Swiggy and Zomato are both assessing several new services as they diversify beyond their core businesses, ET has reported a few days ago. Swiggy is all set to launch a pilot programme for a services marketplace, labelled ‘Yello’, which will host professionals such as lawyers, therapists, fitness trainers, astrologers, dieticians, according to sources. It is also testing a premium membership service called ‘Rare’, for affluent customers providing them access to high-end events such as Formula 1 races, music concerts, upscale art exhibitions, in addition to VIP hospitality and priority reservations at luxury restaurants.
Zomato has previously been bold in its diversification moves by buying Paytm’s events and ticket business for Rs 2,048 crore. It is now trying out a concierge-like service to help users place online food orders over WhatsApp. Human customer relationship agents will provide the Gurgaon-based company’s new service instead of its usual approach of deploying chatbots, a person familiar with the move has told ET recently.
Apprehending challenges by quick commerce players, Flipkart has already started its own quick commerce business Flipkart Minutes. While still far behind its established rivals, Flipkart Minutes hit daily orders of 50,000-60,000 during its Big Billion Days sales, people with knowledge of the matter told ET last month.
Further investment and bigger players entering the sector will heat up competition among the quick commerce companies even as they will grapple with new challenges such as logistics as they expand. But a bloody war could soon be seen on the e-commerce battlefield as emboldened by huge popular response the quick commerce companies start invading on the well-guarded turf of Flipkart and Amazon.

A winter wish to warm up buyers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/a-winter-wish-to-warm-up-buyers/articleshow/115267464.cms,14-11-2024,"Apparel retailers
and daily household brands said they are not cutting inventory despite consumption slowdown to ensure enough products are on shelves as the critical
winter shopping
period approaches, even as India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasted warm November with no hint of winter.
""We are going the whole hog for the winter season and do not want to be conservative in our orders. We don't want any missed opportunity from a demand standpoint,"" said Devarajan Iyer, chief executive of department store chain Lifestyle International. Sales of discretionary items such as apparel, footwear and beauty have slowed down over the past six quarters after two years of pandemic-induced runway growth.
In fact, last year, retailers had to resort to high discounting to clear excess stock that had piled up due to a delayed and mild winter.
Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail said it is very well prepared for the season. ""It's not strong versus weak winter, it's when it gets timed-early winter versus late winter, etc. So we're fairly prepared for that, and my sense is that it should be a decent winter,"" said Vishak Kumar, CEO at

During the September quarter, most retailers called out subdued demand environments across categories. However, there were some positive indicators, primarily driven by festive spending and an increase in wedding-related shopping activity, expecting a strong second half of the year.
However, due to volatility in demand, retailers are struggling with forecasting their inventory levels. ""There's a lot of work which is happening in the planning and the
inventory management
. Looking at the opportunity, we also took some risks, we also planned, and seasonality is one big piece in India, and especially for us, because we operate a lot in northern India. So we have a lot of seasonal change in this period of time when you are in summer and then move into autumn and suddenly you start moving in the winter,"" Lalit Agarwal, chairman at
V-Mart Retail
, told investors. ""Winter has been showing very, very differentiated and unpredictable."" Seasonality-led demand is not just restricted to apparel. Several food and personal care categories such as skin creams and Chyawanprash are also dependent on winter for their sales growth.
""We are having no hold on anything, whether it's advertising or its activation or trade lubrication,""
Dabur
CEO Mohit Malhotra said. ""I hope the winter is strong, more severe and more protracted so that Chyawanprash business does well for us. We also have plans to recover our beverage business, which is a little pain point at the moment.""

Quick Commerce captures nearly half of Kirana sales; market projected to hit $40 billion by 2030,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-captures-nearly-half-of-kirana-sales-market-projected-to-hit-40-billion-by-2030/articleshow/115265558.cms,13-11-2024,"As consumer preferences shift towards the convenience of last-minute grocery deliveries,
quick commerce
companies are outpacing traditional retailers, with 46 per cent of consumers surveyed reporting a cut in purchases from Kirana shops, a report has said. The quick commerce market size is expected to reach USD 40 billion by 2030, a jump from USD 6.1 billion in 2024, according to the report by Datum Intelligence.
""Nearly half (46 per cent) of respondents report reduced spending at Kirana shops, indicating a shift in customer behavior towards
quick commerce platforms
,"" it noted.
Quick commerce refers to the delivery of consumer items in 10-30 minutes. Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and Flipkart Minutes are among the top quick commerce platforms in India.
The quick commerce market is projected to capture approximately USD 1.28 billion of
Kirana sales
by 2024, accounting for 21 per cent of total sales on these platforms, the report further said.
""Quick commerce's focus on speed and convenience aligns with consumers' needs for efficient, on-demand grocery shopping experiences plays a major role in the adoption of online grocery,"" it said.
Live Events
The study said that around 75 per cent of online grocery buyers have increased their unplanned purchases in the past six months, with a majority of them spending over Rs 400 per order. With an average order value significantly higher than traditional stores, consumers are increasingly opting for the convenience and speed offered by these platforms, it said.
This shift is facilitated by the platforms' ability to provide competitive pricing by eliminating multiple intermediaries that traditional retail relies upon, the report observed.
In contrast, Kirana stores, which historically dominated the Indian grocery market, are now facing an existential threat. The report showed that over 82 per cent of consumers have shifted at least one-fourth of their grocery spending from Kirana stores to quick commerce platforms.
""Quick commerce has witnessed an unprecedented pace of adoption, significantly influencing consumer behaviours across the retail ecosystem.
""It is projected to experience a 74 per cent growth in 2024, positioning it as the fastest-growing channel during the 2023-28 forecast period with a 48 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR),"" the report said.
Quick commerce, which began with the delivery of groceries and essential items, has now expanded to include a diverse range of products. This includes electronics, clothing, cosmetics, household goods, medicines, pet supplies, books, sporting equipment, and more.
An interesting finding from the study revealed that 75 per cent of online shoppers experienced a significant increase in unplanned purchases over the past six months.
""The increased confidence in receiving grocery items within 10 minutes through quick commerce platforms has led to a surge in unplanned purchases.""
Conducted in October 2024, the study derived insights from a survey of 3,000 adults across 10 Indian cities, in-depth interviews with industry stakeholders and experts, kirana shop owners, market data, broker reports and media reports.

CAIT releases white paper with allegations of unfair trade practices against quick commerce companies,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/cait-releases-white-paper-with-allegations-of-unfair-trade-practices-against-quick-commerce-companies/articleshow/115253811.cms,13-11-2024,"Traders industry body, the Confederation of All India Traders (
CAIT
) on Wednesday released a White Paper, raising serious concerns over the alleged practices of
quick commerce
platforms like Blinkit, Instamart, Zepto,
Swiggy
etc.
The traders body has been alleging that quick commerce platforms are undermining the foundation of India's
retail economy
. CAIT urged regulatory bodies to intervene and ensurethat quick commerce platforms adhere to fair trade practices and protect the interests of small traders.
Speaking at the press conference, CAIT Secretary General, Praveen Khandelwal, condemned quick commerce platforms for misusing
Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) rules to dominate suppliers, control inventory, and fund
predatory pricing
.
According to CAIT Secretary General strategies adopted by these platforms create an unfair playing field, making it nearly impossible for the 30 million
Kirana stores
to compete with them.
""These platforms are aggressively pushing small retailers out of the market,"" Khandelwal said

The White Paper alleges through examples of how quick commerce companies are violating FDI policies and the Competition Act of India. These violations, coupled with lack of transparency, harm small businesses and distort the retail ecosystem, said the industry body.
Addressing media in New Delhi, Khandelwal acknowledged Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's recent statements, which reflect similar concerns, underscoring that such unfair practices by Quick Commerce platforms will not be tolerated.
The White Paper alleged that quick commerce platforms, backed by over Rs 54,000 crores in FDI, have not invested in creating infrastructure or long-term assets. Instead, they use FDI to subsidize operational losses, control supply chains, and offer predatory discounts through a small group of preferred sellers.
These practices have facilitated quick commerce platforms to capture 25-30 per cent of the market which was once dominated by Kirana stores, putting many traditional retailers on the brink of closure.
The White Paper alleges multiple regulatory violations by Quick Commerce platforms, including, restricted market access, predatory pricing, lack of transparency, and FEMA violations.
The White Paper also charges that these platforms are also violating the Competition Act, 2002. Their agreements with preferred sellers have restricted market competition and limited consumer choice.
CAIT urged immediate regulatory intervention by regulators and the government to hold these platforms accountable. If allowed unchecked growth driven by foreign capital poses a significant threat to India's small retail ecosystem.
CAIT called on the government to enforce stricter oversight through the proposed consumer protection (E-commerce) Rules, E-commerce Policy and ensure that Quick Commerce platforms operate with greater accountability while preserving the integrity of India's retail sector.

Reliance Retail's shutting down Centro outlets temporarily,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retails-shutting-down-centro-outlets-temporarily/articleshow/115228875.cms,13-11-2024,"Mumbai:
Reliance Retail
is temporarily shutting down stores in its department chain Centro to reposition the format with mostly its own brands and labels it has launched in India as a licensee partner.
In September 2022, the retail division of
Reliance Industries
had converted Future Group's Central into Centro in locations where it had taken over the lease after the Future Group surrendered the property to it.
Reliance Retail has shut three stores and will shut another two dozen doors by the end of the month, according to executives of companies which have been asked by the country's biggest retailer to take back their inventory and fixtures citing renovation and repositioning of the format.
""RRL (Reliance Retail) has decided to temporarily pause operations of all its
Centro outlets
across the country as part of the remodelling process,"" it said in a letter to the brands, a copy of which was seen by ET. ""Display, storage, and sale of the merchandise shall be paused at the outlets. In view of the imminent hiatus of operation of the outlets, you are hereby required to arrange for the removal of all goods, merchandise, stocks, promotional materials, or any other items belonging to you which are at present, deployed at the outlets.""
Live Events
While it is still not clear whether Reliance Retail will house existing local and global brands once the stores reopen, the idea is to utilise the space for its own brands as a
shop-in-shop model
. The retailer has either partnered or acquired around 80 overseas brands from Gap and Superdry, besides having its own brands such as Azorte and Yousta.
Centro, which sells about 450 local and global brands, competes with Dubai-based Lifestyle International and Raheja's
Shoppers Stop
in the department store format. India's retail sales expansion slowed to 4% last year after a surge in spending across segments-from clothes to cars-in the post-Covid-19 period, triggered by revenge shopping.
Last month, Reliance Retail, which runs about 18,946 stores spanning grocery, consumer electronics and apparel, reported a 3.5% decline in revenue from operations for the three months to September. It said weak demand in the
fashion and lifestyle business
and calibrated approach to improve margins in its wholesale business hurt revenue, the first instance of a revenue decline for India's biggest retailer except during the pandemic when government restrictions forced the company to shut stores temporarily.
""While the overall macro context remained weak and we had degrowth in the business on the apparel, apparel and footwear side, the fundamentals remain strong. We are investing in technology to improve our design to shelf cycle, we are improving our design capabilities so that these will help us continue our market leadership over a longer time frame,"" Dinesh Taluja, chief financial officer at Reliance Retail, told analysts last month.
Reliance Retail has also slowed down expansion and sharply increased
store closures
this fiscal, resulting in only 110 net store additions in the first half of the fiscal though it opened 795 stores.
This means store closures exceeded store openings by more than six times. In the year-ago period, it reported net store additions of 610 outlets when it had opened 1,026 stores.

Swiggy
and
Zomato
, are testing various services to diversify beyond their core operations, sources close to the matter shared. Bengaluru-based Swiggy is piloting a new services marketplace called 'Yello,' offering customers access to professionals such as lawyers, astrologers, dieticians, therapists, and fitness trainers. According to insiders, this initiative could potentially be hosted within the main Swiggy app or as a separate platform. This move aligns with Swiggy’s larger goal of expanding beyond food and grocery delivery.
Swiggy is also exploring a premium membership service named ‘Rare,’ catering to affluent customers with perks like access to exclusive events and priority restaurant reservations. These offerings signal a strategic push into high-value services as Swiggy nears its planned stock market listing on November 13.
Zomato’s expansion into customer service and event ticketing
Meanwhile, Zomato is reportedly working on a concierge service, enabling users to place food orders over WhatsApp, assisted by human agents instead of automated chatbots. According to sources, the Gurgaon-based company has started recruiting for this service, aiming to enhance customer experience with personalized support.
Zomato has also been bold in its diversification, evidenced by its acquisition of Paytm’s events and ticketing business for Rs 2,048 crore. This acquisition broadens Zomato's portfolio, bringing it into direct competition with new and established players in the Indian e-commerce and quick commerce space.

Different approaches to growth
While Swiggy and Zomato both explore new markets, they adopt contrasting strategies. Swiggy’s approach emphasizes a consolidated platform model, where its main app offers multiple services such as Instamart, Swiggy Genie, and Dineout. Zomato, by contrast, operates through distinct brands for different services, aiming to build independent identities for each.
Experts suggest that diversification is essential for sustaining growth in a competitive environment. “They have shown the market that their core businesses work, but these will eventually scale to a point where growth slows,” said a Mumbai-based analyst. As food delivery stabilizes, both Swiggy and Zomato are shifting focus to sustain momentum.
New services as differentiators
Swiggy’s upcoming ‘Yello’ marketplace aims to fill a gap in the market, providing a vetted, one-stop platform for various service professionals. Currently, Google offers limited access to similar services, but no comprehensive platform exists for verified online professionals, noted a source familiar with Swiggy’s plans.
Zomato, on the other hand, is developing a handyman services platform within Blinkit, positioning itself to compete with NCR-based Urban Company. Last year, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal stepped down from Urban Company’s board to avoid conflicts of interest as Blinkit expands into this domain.

In the quick commerce arena, both companies have introduced new offerings. Swiggy launched its 10-minute delivery service, Bolt, in October, which provides select items from local restaurants. Zomato, after acquiring Blinkit in 2022, continues to grow its own quick delivery service, competing in the increasingly popular rapid delivery space.

The products, which idolise criminal figures, pose a significant risk to the society by promoting a distorted image (of values) which could influence young minds negatively, an official said.
During the online vigil by cyber security officials, it was found that several e-commerce platforms, including Flipkart, AliExpress, and marketplaces like TeeShopper and Etsy, had been selling T-shirts that glorify gangsters like Lawrence Bishnoi and Dawood Ibrahim, the official said.
The Maharashtra Cyber in a release said it considers this as material harmful, as it attempts to corrupt values of the youth by using seemingly casual apparel to spread messages that glorify criminal lifestyles.
Taking serious cognisance of the matter, the Maharashtra Cyber has registered a case against the sellers responsible for the listing of these objectionable products under various Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections, including 192 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 196 (promoting enmity between different groups) and 353 (public mischief) and provisions of the Information Technology Act, the release said.

The central robe agency initiated its FEMA investigation based on several complaints against Amazon and Flipkart, it informed through an official statement. According to ED, the e-commerce entities providing marketplace are violating FDI rules by directly or indirectly influencing the sale price of goods or services and not providing level playing field for all the vendors.
Meanwhile, Amazon and Flipkart did not respond to request from Reuters for comments; while the ED noted to the agency that it does not have immediate comments.
Earlier, the news agency had reported that an Indian antitrust investigation found that the two companies had violated local competition laws by giving preference to select sellers on their shopping websites. The US based e-commerce giant Amazon as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart have both refuted the charges.
In a 1027-page report on Amazon and a separate 1,696-page report on Flipkart, both dated Aug. 9, the Competition Committee of India investigators said the two companies were found to have created an ecosystem where preferred sellers appeared higher in search results, elbowing out other sellers.

The platforms ""had end-to-end control over the inventory and the sellers are just name lending enterprises,” noted the antitrust body probe, which are not public but have been seen by Reuters.
A Reuters investigation in 2021, based on internal Amazon papers, showed the company exerted significant control over the inventory of some of the biggest sellers, even though Indian laws prohibit foreign players from holding inventory of products.
The financial probe agency has been investigating both e-commerce giants for years for allegedly bypassing foreign investment laws that strictly regulate multi-brand retail and restrict such companies to operating a marketplace for sellers, reported Reuters.
Reuther’s first government source on Thursday said it was conducting the latest searches on the observations of the antitrust body in its recently concluded investigation of the two companies.
Commerce minister Piyush Goyal had publicly attacked Amazon in in August, saying the company’s investments in India have often been used to cover its business losses, adding that such losses ""smell of predatory pricing.""

During Q2, the company's fashion concepts registered double digit LFL growth, it said. According to the earning commentary statement, both Westside and Zudio saw traction despite the impact of business seasonality. ""Our Westside loyalty program, WestStyleClub, registered strong growth. Across all our brands, we remain focused on delivering consistent value to customers in terms of both the fashion and price. In addition, our stores continue to provide an improved brand experience as we continue with our expansion program,"" the commentary said.
The company further said that emerging categories including beauty & personal care, innerwear and footwear continued to gain traction with customers. These emerging categories contribute to over 20% of the company's revenues, a statement said.

"Shopping on credit nearly doubled during Diwali for e-commerce consumers, cash on delivery slumps - GoKwik",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/shopping-on-credit-nearly-doubled-during-diwali-for-e-commerce-consumers-cash-on-delivery-slumps-gokwik/articleshow/115015657.cms,06-11-2024,"Credit has almost doubled this festive season largely led by credit cards and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) options for D2C brands on GoKwik’s network. The preference for credit surged from 3.49% earlier to 6.9% this year thus indicating healthy economic performance and increased consumer sentiment.
This Diwali sale period shoppers had a higher preference for prepaid payment modes with a 13% surge in prepaid orders compared to last year. On the contrary, cash on delivery (COD) orders saw an 8% dip in the same period, said GoKwik, an eCommerce enabler that helps brands improve profits and efficiency by reducing COD orders.
“Affordability has always been a key driver for e-commerce growth in India, with shoppers opting for more flexible payment choices. We've been focused on building an ecosystem that supports this innate need among Indian shoppers. By offering multiple prepaid options on our checkout, we have not only provided more affordable payment choices to shoppers, but also provided greater control to merchants over their growth,” said Chirag Taneja, co-founder and CEO, GoKwik. ""Having a higher prepaid share of orders helps brands mitigate the impact of return to origin (RTO) and enables profitable growth for them. Our efforts in this direction have started to show the much needed shift in consumer preference.""
GoKwik houses over 10000 brands in its network including Lenskart, Neemans, Man Matters, Shoppers Stop, etc, ranging from fashion, beauty, health and nutrition, electronics and other key categories of the online shopping space. The eCommerce enabler houses over 120 million shoppers in its network of D2C brands.
COD (Cash on Delivery) is a payment method where customers pay upon receiving their goods. This can build trust with buyers wary of online payments, especially in areas with fraud concerns. While COD enables businesses to access a wider customer base in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions, it can also cause cash flow delays, higher return rates, and increased logistical costs, potentially impacting profitability. However, COD in India still continues to be dominant at 46% followed by UPI at 44%.

Categories such as footwear and fashion have seen the highest preference for credit-based prepaid payments while certain other categories like beauty and personal care continued to show high preference for COD. Also, there is a shift in consumer preference from COD to credit payment options such as credit cards and BNPL in tier 3 cities.
""We are happy to support GoKwik during this festive sale period. With an exceptional 99.9% uptime, Easebuzz platform empowered D2C brands manage millions of transactions without any downtimes, a crucial advantage during peak shopping periods.

While overall Average Order Value (AOV) rose by a nominal 3% during this period, categories like fashion and jewellery saw particularly strong growth at 15% and 13% respectively. Categories with high AOV products like electronics saw a 36% increase in credit card payments and a 27% increase in BNPL, showing that shoppers prefer these payment methods for high-value purchases.

Air purifier sales stagnate as marketers fail to capitalise on worsening pollution,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/air-purifier-sales-stagnate-as-marketers-fail-to-capitalise-on-worsening-pollution/articleshow/114949072.cms,04-11-2024,"Despite worsening air quality in Indian metroes and cities like Delhi-NCR plunging to “dangerous” levels, marketers have failed to make “combat pollution” a big business.
Sales of air purifiers
are limited to just 3-4 weeks after Diwali, that too mostly in the Delhi-NCR belt, with the market not even growing for some years which forced some top companies such as Samsung,
Voltas
,
Panasonic
, Daikin and
Haier
to either exit the segment or go “very slow”.
Industry executives said consumers do not perceive air purifiers as a product which gives tangible value since they can’t see the effect in real time. Sales happen in Delhi-NCR when there is intense
smoggy condition
and worsening air quality index (AQI) hits the headlines.
""Consumers, mostly in Delhi-NCR, use air purifiers for just 4-6 weeks in a year. It has failed to be a must-have category even when pollution is year-round and in all cities. Rest of the markets, people buy only when recommended by
doctors
,"" said Nilesh Gupta, director at Vijay Sales, a leading electronics retailer with over 100
stores
.
Gupta said even in the current scenario in Delhi-NCR, sales are only lukewarm. He said people who buy or use it, pack it after the worst period is over.
Live Events
The scenario is no different for some pollution combating personal care products which fast moving consumer goods companies have launched that have largely remained a not so sales grosser.
Emami
’s The Man Company and Himalaya have launched anti-pollution face wash,
ITC
has a pollution protect combo of a facial cleanser and cream,
Hindustan Unilever
through its Pond’s brand, apart from those launched by start-ups.
“It’s a small market,” said Emami Ltd managing director Harsha Agarwal. “Consumers will buy these products only if they feel the need or perceive that it will work for them,” he said.
To be sure, executives said retailers and brands present in air purifiers may report 20-25% growth every year after Diwali for 2-3 weeks in Delhi-NCR. But the base is small and annualized growth rates are 1-3% or in some years even flat. Brands operating in this segment are Dyson, Philips,
Eureka Forbes
,
Sharp
and
Honeywell
.
“Indian consumers are seasonal savvy for several products where air purifiers fall. While the pollution health hazards are well known, consumers wait till the last minute to buy air purifiers which are still limited to urban upper middle class,” said
Pulkit Baid
, director at Great Eastern Retail, which runs 95 electronics stores in the north and east.
Haier India president Satish NS said air purifiers have remained a very small market, with no scale whereby the company decided to move out.
A section of the industry also said companies have failed to build the category as a must have for the household such as kitchen appliances, refrigerators and washing machines.
While AQI levels in Delhi have crossed 400, pollution is much more than normal in several places such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and even in the smaller cities.

Shein
and
Temu
have transformed the fashion landscape across
Europe
and the United States. In the U.S., Shein and Temu are challenging
Amazon
's dominance, while in Europe, they are reshaping the market by competing aggressively with established fashion retailers like
Zara
and H&M, reported The Times of India (TOI). The appeal lies in their ultra-low prices and vast product ranges, making long-standing retailers seem less competitive in comparison.
Zara and H&M are feeling the pressure, as Temu and Shein are often able to undercut their prices and deliver faster, feeding a growing demand for ultra-fast fashion in Europe.
Recently, however, Temu has come under scrutiny in Europe. The
European Commission
, the EU's executive arm, has reportedly launched an investigation into Temu, following suspicions that the company may not be effectively preventing the sale of illegal products. This probe, reported by the Associated Press, follows Temu's addition to the EU’s list of “very large online platforms,” which are subject to stringent oversight under the
Digital Services Act
(DSA).
The investigation centers on potential violations of the DSA, particularly regarding consumer protection, fair competition, and data privacy. The EU’s concerns focus on the sale of non-compliant goods, addictive design elements, and the transparency of recommendation algorithms. Regulators are also troubled by how easily “rogue traders” can reappear on the platform after suspension.
Temu, owned by China’s Pinduoduo, has stated its dedication to complying with EU regulations and safeguarding consumer interests. Nonetheless, the platform faces the risk of substantial penalties if the investigation uncovers significant breaches.
Live Events
This action is part of a wider EU initiative to regulate tech giants and ensure a fair digital economy. Other platforms, including AliExpress, X, and
TikTok
, have also been subject to similar inquiries, demonstrating the EU's resolve to uphold rigorous standards for online businesses.

Indians go premium to do the laundry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indians-go-premium-to-do-the-laundry/articleshow/114918829.cms,04-11-2024,"Mumbai:
Premium detergents
now reach three-fourths of Indian households, largely driven by the liquid variants even as sales stagnated for the overall category since the pandemic.
Pricier washing powders were used at about 53% of the households nearly four years ago, according to a latest report from market tracker Kantar.
Mid-tier brands have not grown both in terms of penetration and sales volume in the last four years, while mass tier brands have slowed or are declining in market share. In fact, the volume contribution of mass brands has shrunk from 72% in 2020 to 67% now, as per the data. And this is entirely taken by the premium category which now accounts to a fifth of the overall sales compared with 13% four years ago.
""Over the last four years, this is the only price tier that has seen consistent double-digit growth. Within the category, the smaller washing liquid scene is a bustling one. Currently 30% of urban households purchase this format, and not to be left out, even 13% of rural households are now buying this premium format,"" said K Ramakrishnan, managing director-South Asia, worldpanel division at Kantar.
During the pandemic, Indians did not wash their clothes as often as previously or used lower-priced products for their laundry chore, resulting in weak demand for laundry products. Also, consumers had tucked away their expensive and formal garments as work-from-home and limited socialising prompted them to live in everyday wear such as shorts, lounge pyjamas and T-shirts which require minimal cleaning, industry executives and researchers said.

However, for the last two years, the penetration of the liquid format has been in double digits, indicating its growing acceptance. Nearly two out of every 10 households in the country purchase a washing liquid now.
""Laundry liquid is a really exciting category growing really fast. It's going to be one of the largest FMCG categories. We are going to play this aggressively,"" Sudhir Sitapati, managing director at
Godrej Consumer Products
told investors. ""Ezee (its liquid detergent) is a high-margin player, and this category may be margin dilutive, we have to find ways of funding it in the rest of the portfolio. So, this will be a growth driver for us going forward as it surprised us this year itself. But I think it will continue to be a big growth driver for us,"" he said.
Hindustan Unilever
's
Surf Excel
is the fastest growing brand in the category and over the last five years, its penetration jumped from 49% to 68%, Kantar said.
For quite some time, the brand has been riding on the success of its ₹10 pack, and the recent jump in demand for washing liquids is helping even as HUL's Wheel remained the biggest brand in the country in terms of volume, accounting for a fifth of the segment. Surf, Wheel and RSPL Group's Ghari account for half the category volume.

"After Diwali and festivities, traders' focus shifts to wedding season",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/after-diwali-and-festivities-traders-focus-shifts-to-wedding-season/articleshow/114911159.cms,03-11-2024,"After a successful
Diwali season
,
traders
across the country are now preparing for major business opportunities in the upcoming
wedding season
, set to begin with Dev UthEkadashi on November 12 and continue until December 16.
According to a study conducted by the
Confederation of All India Traders
(CAIT), the retail sector, encompassing both goods and services, is expected to benefit from approximately 48 lakh weddings, generating business worth nearly Rs 6 lakh crore.
Last year, an estimated 35 lakh weddings during this season created business worth Rs 4.25 lakh crore.
This year, the increase in auspicious wedding dates is anticipated to bring significant growth.
In 2023, there were 11 auspicious dates, whereas this year there are 18, further fueling the trade, CAIT asserted. Delhi alone is expected to witness 4.5 lakh weddings.
Live Events
According to Acharya Durgesh Tare, Convenor of CAIT's Veda and Spiritual Committee, auspicious dates for this season fall on November 12, 13, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 29, and on December 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 16.
Following this period, there will be a pause of about a month before the wedding season resumes from mid-January to March 2025.
CAIT has derived these business estimates based on discussions with major business organisations across 75 cities, specifically those dealing in
wedding-related goods
and services.
CAIT's Secretary General and Member of Parliament from Chandni Chowk, Praveen Khandelwal, stated that the study has also highlighted a shift in
consumer purchasing behaviour
, with people increasingly opting for
Indian products
over foreign goods, reflecting the success of
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
's 'Vocal for Local' and 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' vision.
Khandelwal noted that these estimates are based on auspicious dates, though numerous weddings will also occur on non-auspicious dates. Additionally, various pre-wedding functions, like mehendi, sangeet, and engagements, also represent significant expenses.
Khandelwal further explained that
wedding expenses
are divided between goods and services, with main expenditure areas in goods including clothing, sarees, lehengas, and apparel, jewellery, electronics and appliances, dry fruits, sweets, and snacks, groceries and vegetables, gift items, among others.
In the services sector, expenditures will likely go toward banquet halls, hotels, and venues, event management, tent decoration, catering services, floral decorations, transportation and cab services, photography and videography, orchestra and music, lighting and sound, and other services. A new trend emerging is the increasing spending on social media services for weddings.

Amazon India records high growth in premium product sales across categories during festival period,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazon-india-records-high-growth-in-premium-product-sales-across-categories-during-festival-period/articleshow/114888524.cms,02-11-2024,"New Delhi: Demand for premium products across categories, including television, smartphones, and large appliances, dominated the Diwali season sale during the
Amazon
Great Indian Festival (AGIF) 2024 that commenced from September 27, a senior company official said on Saturday.
Amazon India
Vice President Saurabh Srivastava told PTI that the company recorded 10-times growth in Apple iPad sales and five-times growth in Samsung tablets during the Amazon Great Indian Festival (AGIF) 2024.
""One clear trend that was there is premiumisation. When we look at it, whether it is televisions or fashion and beauty, gaming laptops, home and kitchen appliances, we have seen a clear trend of premiumisation. People are preferring more premium products. Again, this is not limited to just top cities,"" Srivastava said.
He said large-screen TVs contributed to about 30 per cent of the total unit sales in the segment and there was 10-times growth in their demand on a year-over-year basis with Samsung, Xiaomi, and Sony emerging as the most-preferred TV brands.
""In tablets, Apple and Samsung are premium products. Apple tablets grew 10 times, and Samsung tablets 5 times year on year (YoY). When you think about large appliances, obviously, these are washing machines and refrigerators and ACs, but premium ones like front-load washing machines, or side-by-side refrigerators, or bigger than 1.5-ton ACs, grew 30 per cent YoY,"" Srivastava said.
He said the fashion and beauty segment recorded a 400 per cent spike in premium categories across watches, fragrances, handbags, Korean beauty, jewellery, luggage, etc.

"Silver, the poor man's gold, beats precious metal to set a record in festive season",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/dhanteras-2024-silver-the-poor-mans-gold-beats-precious-metal-to-set-a-record-in-festive-season/articleshow/114809372.cms,31-10-2024,"For the first time in the history of the
Indian jewellery market
,
silver sales
surpassed gold during this Dhanteras season. High
gold prices
have dampened consumer demand, leading shoppers to turn to silver instead.
""Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras,"" Surendra Mehta, national secretary at Indian Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA), told ToI. ""We are collating data for silver because this is the first time we are seeing such a huge demand,"" he added.
The surge in
silver demand
is also driven by its expected high industrial demand, mainly from electric vehicle manufacturers. ""People have now begun to understand that there is a real opportunity in
investing in silver
,"" Mehta said.
While silver demand increased by 30-35%, gold sales fell by 15% to around 35-36 tonnes compared to 42 tonnes last festive season. However, due to the 30% rise in the average price of gold, the total value of gold sales reached nearly Rs 28,000 crore, up from about Rs 24,000-25,000 crore last year.
The
World Gold Council
has projected that India's
gold demand
may hit a four-year low in 2024 due to the ongoing record-breaking rally in prices. Gold prices on NYMEX surpassed the $2,800 per ounce mark for the first time, influenced by global uncertainties, geopolitical issues, the US election, and continuing demand from central banks and the solar energy industry.

Gold demand in India, the world's second-largest consumer of the precious metal, is expected to be between 700 to 750 tonnes in 2024, the lowest since 2020, according to Sachin Jain, regional CEO (India) at WGC.
In the local market, gold prices hovered above Rs 80,000 per 10 grams, while silver prices remained above Rs 1 lakh per kg.Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst at HDFC Securities, noted that gold's recent record came after US treasury yields and the dollar fell following mixed US macroeconomic data.
Meanwhile, following a significant surge this year, with domestic silver prices reaching the ₹1 lakh per kg milestone, analysts suggest that investors may consider buying on dips in the upcoming 1-3 months, potentially allocating 3-5% of their portfolios to the precious metal. Since the beginning of 2024, silver has risen by 33.65%, while in the past month alone, it has appreciated by 12.5%.
This performance has outpaced the Nifty 50 index, which recorded a 12.5% return year-to-date but experienced a 5.6% decline over the last month. In dollar terms, silver's gains stand at 47.25% and 13.56%, respectively.
An analysis conducted by Capitalmind Financial Services highlights that a low-volatility portfolio maximizing returns since 2000 would have featured a heavy allocation to gold—62% gold, 35% Nifty, and a modest 3% in silver.
Anoop Vijaykumar from Capitalmind said that a portfolio focused on equities, with a moderate gold component, could provide more stable risk-adjusted returns along with potentially higher absolute returns and reduced drawdowns compared to a strategy invested solely in Nifty or equities.
Typically, investors adjust their allocations to silver and gold based on market conditions and their individual risk tolerance.

"Retailers, brands say festive sales are higher, but flag weak sentiment",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-brands-say-festive-sales-are-higher-but-flag-weak-sentiment/articleshow/114786238.cms,31-10-2024,"New Delhi:
Luxury sales
this
Diwali
seem to be a mixed bag for
retailers and brands
with some reporting double-digit growth in sales over a year earlier while pointing also to subdued sentiments elsewhere. However, most retailers and brands ET spoke with said they have seen an uptick in sales.
""Sales for us are 10-15% higher than last year. I think we got lucky and we got some good
corporate orders
as well, but we are hearing the business has been weaker this Diwali for some of the other luxury categories,"" said Viraal Rajan, owner and director of Time Avenue that retails luxury
watches
of brands such as Rolex and Chopard.
Pushpa Bector, senior executive director and business head at DLF Retail, said while she sees
growth in luxury sales
, some brands might have experienced “degrowth”.
""Generally, it was not as vibrant as we thought it would be. We might have expected growth at par with levels seen in 2022-2023 but the base of growth has come down. Watches had a golden run, but there can't be 100% growth each season. Certain brands in luxury bags and accessories are growing but some are not,"" she added.
Tata CLiQ
chief executive Gopal Asthana said strong growth in orders and average ticket value, along with “significant bets” on categories like fashion and accessories, are driving Tata CLiQ Luxury's growth this Diwali.

“Gifting is an integral part of the festive season, and there’s a growing demand and interest in
gifting luxury products
. We are seeing a surge in categories like beauty, fragrances, home, jewellery and watches,” he added.
Nikhil Lamba, CEO of Lladró India, said the India business grew 7% over last year in the festive period.
“Each year we add a new high porcelain creation to the Spirit of India collection, and this year Lord Hanuman, a limited edition of 499 units, made a significant contribution to the growth,” he added.
Luxury watch sales have been good overall, and global luxury brands have also become a lot more active around Diwali, said Pratiek Kapoor, director at Kapoor Watch Company.
Sanskriti Gupta, spokesperson at Läderach India, said the

"Gold, cars, and smart electronics drive strong Dhanteras sales amid festive cheer",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/gold-cars-and-smart-electronics-drive-strong-dhanteras-sales-amid-festive-cheer/articleshow/114768250.cms,30-10-2024,"In a promising upturn for India’s consumer industry, the festive occasion of
Dhanteras
saw robust sales across various segments, bringing relief to companies that had been grappling with a slow market. With a marked uptick in consumer purchases, high-value items like gold, automobiles, and
premium electronics
recorded significant demand, signaling a potential rebound from the sluggishness seen earlier this year.
Gold, traditionally a preferred Dhanteras purchase, attracted high interest despite a surge in prices. Leading jewelry brand Tanishq noted rising footfalls, with Arun Narayan, VP of Marketing and Retail, observing an increase in demand for gold coins, jewelry, and diamonds. “We are confident to surpass what we did last year in terms of value,” he said, attributing the rise to customer interest in lighter jewelry pieces amid higher prices.
Automobiles experienced a surge in showroom visits, fueled by attractive discounts and the festive mood. Major carmakers like Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors, and JSW MG reported robust sales.
Maruti Suzuki
witnessed record-breaking numbers, with sales estimated between 40,000 to 42,000 units—a substantial jump from last year’s 23,000 units. Partho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer for Sales and Marketing at Maruti Suzuki, told TOI, “Festive season has shaped up well for the industry, and some of our models are stocked out.”
JSW MG’s electric range gained traction, with its new model Windsor seeing increased deliveries. Tata Motors reported a 30% growth in October, with around 15,000 vehicle sales on Dhanteras. Shailesh Chandra, MD of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Electric Mobility, attributed the rise to “strong retail demand.”
The electronics segment mirrored this trend. Popular smartphones, from iPhones to Oppo, saw sustained demand, while premium, large-screen televisions recorded strong sales. Manish Sharma, Chairman of Panasonic Life Solutions, noted that “Premiumisation continues to be the flavour of the season,” with growing interest in high-end 4K LED TVs, smart inverter ACs, and other
smart appliances
. LG and Panasonic saw high demand in premium categories, with consumer preference bolstered by cashbacks, easy financing, and festival offers.
Live Events
Apple's premium retailer in India, Unicorn Infosolutions, registered a 10% increase in sales over the previous Dhanteras, driven by the strong demand for the newly launched iPhone 16. Footfalls remained high through the evening, with Sanjay Chitkara, Senior VP of Home Appliances, commenting, “This will continue till late night. Customers are buying more of premium appliances and large-screen TVs.”
Dhanteras has effectively revived consumer confidence, pushing sales across multiple sectors and offering companies a significant boost in a year that has seen considerable economic strain.

Indian FMCG giants are 'Designing for India' to reach the modern consumer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indian-fmcg-giants-are-designing-for-india-to-reach-the-modern-consumer/articleshow/114767697.cms,30-10-2024,"As consumer preferences grow more selective,
FMCG
companies are shifting focus toward “designing for India,” investing in products that cater to varied
local tastes
and preferences. This has spurred
Hindustan Unilever
(HUL) and its counterparts to fine-tune both product development and production processes to meet regional demands.
An example is in HUL’s tea offerings. ""In the South, the Red Label tea we sell is a finer blend. In the North, it’s more grainy. The way we process the tea is also quite different,"" Vibhav Sanzgiri, HUL’s Executive Director for R&D, told TOI's Asmita Dey. HUL's strategy underscores the complexity of catering to India’s different regional tastes, climates, and lifestyles. Sanzgiri, who leads a team of over 800 scientists across HUL’s three R&D centers, noted that consumer expectations now extend beyond taste to include health benefits, wellness, fragrance, and even packaging.
Beyond HUL,
Colgate-Palmolive
is also responding to India's unique consumer profile. To cater to consumers’ fondness for snacking, the company introduced arginine-based toothpaste to address oral health concerns. “When designing for Indian consumers, we need to incorporate local taste nuances and focus on the target demographic,” explained Swati Agarwal, Executive Vice-President at Colgate-Palmolive India. The brand has also incorporated localized scents into its shower gel products, recognizing that consumer preference varies across regions.
Marico’s approach is to offer healthier product choices without compromising on flavor. Recently, under its Saffola brand,
Marico
expanded its portfolio with options like honey, millets, and soya chunks, following positive consumer reception of its oats infused with traditional Indian flavors. “Indian consumer preferences are continually evolving, with a growing demand for healthier and sustainable products,” said Dr. Shilpa Vora, Marico’s Chief R&D Officer.
Consumer readiness to pay a premium for healthier, more sophisticated options is influencing product launches across the industry. A Fireside Ventures study reported that urban consumers in India are willing to pay up to 15% more for items in the staple and healthy snack categories and up to 30% for premium functional beverages.
Nestle India
has capitalized on this premiumization trend, launching over 140 products in the past eight years, with popular items like Maggi oats-millets and KitKat Dessert Delight Strawberry later reaching international markets. Sanzgiri noted, “Everyone aspires for the best product suited for them, and this trend will continue. Indians today are more globally exposed, which influences consumer preferences.”

Swiggy tweaks IPO menu to put more money in business even Ambani is eyeing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/swiggy-ipo-funds-quick-commerce-funds-tweaks-ipo-menu-to-put-more-money-in-quick-commerce-business-that-even-reliances-mukesh-ambani-is-eyeing/articleshow/114759144.cms,30-10-2024,"Swiggy, the popular food and grocery delivery service, has set a fresh course for its future growth through a pivot in its Initial Public Offering (IPO) plans. As it gears up for its public debut, the company has revealed a strategy that signals a firm shift toward the high-speed world of quick commerce, allocating more capital to this segment than initially planned.
Swiggy
submitted its red herring prospectus (RHP) to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for its Rs 11,300 crore IPO, where it made a deeper commitment to capitalising on India’s fast-paced retail evolution.
With fierce competition from players like BigBasket, Blinkit, Zepto in quick deliveries, Swiggy is raising its primary fund target via issuing new shares from Rs 3,750 crore to Rs 4,499 crore. Swiggy now intends to channel Rs 1,179 crore — 20% higher than earlier planned—specifically into its quick commerce division, Instamart. Swiggy seeks to bet more on a burgeoning business in the world's most populous country that is increasingly using Internet and smartphones to buy products using platforms where even billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
is looking to play a catch up game.

Quick commerce can be bigger than food delivery, won't be a duopoly: Swiggy founder Sriharsha Majety
Quick commerce boom & Swiggy's plans
India's quick commerce landscape has grown explosively in recent years, offering an attractive yet challenging frontier. Quick commerce involves the hyper-fast delivery of groceries, daily essentials, and even premium products, often in less than 30 minutes. The segment grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic as people opted for doorstep deliveries, and it has since expanded to cover an extensive range of products. Consumers now expect faster deliveries, especially in urban India, where convenience is a huge draw.
This trend is fuelled by India’s expanding digital infrastructure, more affordable data plans, and the rise in smartphone usage, which has led to a cultural shift in online shopping behaviors. Quick commerce is expected to reach a market value of nearly $9.95 billion by 2029, growing annually at over 4.5% from $3.34 billion now, according to a Chryseum report.

Dhanteras fatafat: What's behind the 10-minute gold rush?
Swiggy showing more light to dark stores
A core component of Swiggy's quick commerce strategy lies in expanding its network of dark stores, which are warehouses dedicated to fulfilling online orders rapidly. According to its RHP, Swiggy plans to direct Rs 755.4 crore toward enlarging its dark store footprint and Rs 423.3 crore toward leasing and licensing these facilities. This would increase Swiggy’s dark store count to 741, covering around 2.59 million square feet. By comparison, Blinkit has recently expanded to 791 dark stores, underscoring the competitive push across the sector.
These dark stores facilitate Swiggy's promise of delivery within 10–20 minutes, allowing it to stock frequently purchased items close to high-demand areas. With over 605 active dark stores as of mid-September, Swiggy is poised to expand further to meet growing consumer expectations for ultra-fast deliveries.
Swiggy's competition heats up: Reliance in the fray
Swiggy’s increased focus on quick commerce comes as it faces stiff competition from Zepto, Blinkit, and even Reliance. Zepto, with over 500 dark stores, has recently raised an additional $150 million, signaling strong investor confidence in quick commerce. Meanwhile, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance, leveraging its vast network of supermarkets, is expanding into the 10–30 minute delivery segment, further intensifying the race. The quick commerce wave has proven too significant for Reliance to ignore, with the conglomerate aiming to turn its traditional supermarkets into quick commerce hubs. This move is expected to ramp up competition significantly, adding pressure on players like Swiggy and Blinkit to expand aggressively.

To maintain a competitive edge, Swiggy is also allocating Rs 703.4 crore to technology improvements, including cloud infrastructure and logistics optimization, crucial for managing real-time inventory and ensuring that deliveries meet the strict timeframes demanded by quick commerce. Additionally, Swiggy is committing Rs 317.7 crore to marketing, with a primary focus on promoting Instamart to drive consumer adoption and brand loyalty. These tech and marketing investments are aimed at fine-tuning Swiggy’s operations, streamlining customer experience, and ensuring Instamart’s presence across key Indian markets.
How Indians shop these days
This shift toward quick commerce is transforming how Indians shop. While kirana stores and traditional supermarkets have long dominated the retail landscape, the promise of rapid delivery is gradually reshaping consumer expectations. Today, shoppers rely on these platforms for essentials and beyond—from daily grocery needs to high-end electronics. Recently, Blinkit and BigBasket’s BBNow offered same-day delivery of the iPhone 16 on its launch day in select cities, a testament to quick commerce’s ability to disrupt conventional purchasing channels.
In fact, a survey by Datum showed that 46% of quick commerce customers have reduced their visits to mom-and-pop stores, while 36% are shopping less at supermarkets. Quick commerce is even reaching beyond its initial grocery roots, as firms like Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart explore delivering small appliances, kitchen goods, and electronics—items once the domain of traditional e-commerce.

Reliance plays catch-up to ride India quick commerce wave
Despite the excitement around quick commerce, the future of retail remains fluid. Many experts believe that traditional formats, such as kirana stores, supermarkets, and e-commerce, will coexist with quick commerce. Local kirana stores, particularly in rural areas, continue to hold an advantage due to credit options and personalised service that online platforms struggle to replicate. Modern retail has withstood earlier waves of disruption, including the rise of e-commerce, and may similarly adapt to coexist with quick commerce.
However, Swiggy’s decision to pivot heavily toward quick commerce suggests it believes the demand for speed and convenience will endure, particularly in urban areas. Swiggy's increased allocation toward Instamart positions it to capture a significant share of this market as it competes with established players. The quick commerce “gold rush” has shown that while initial profitability may be a challenge, consumer behavior is shifting towards convenience—a promising sign for players willing to invest heavily in quick commerce infrastructure and innovation.

Quick commerce
has reshaped how Indians shop as
Zomato
, SoftBank-backed
Swiggy
and Zepto now promise deliveries from their neighbourhood warehouses within 10 minutes, even beating Amazon. These multi-billion-dollar quick commerce businesses, though loss-making, have disrupted sales of mom-and-pop stores and supermarkets as people opt for quick deliveries of everything from milk and chocolates to Apple iPhones.
The sector has become too hot, too fast for Ambani's
Reliance
to ignore, even though experts say its late entry will face challenges including a lack of small-scale warehouses and running the business from supermarkets focused on walk-in customers.

Datum Intelligence estimates quick commerce sales will hit $6 billion this year, up from just $100 million in 2020. Reliance plans to leverage its 3,000 supermarkets in 1,150 cities for quick deliveries by deploying small teams operating from dedicated kiosks inside, according to three people familiar with its strategy and Reuters' visits to outlets near Mumbai, where the service was launched this month.

Why Mukesh Ambani can't ignore a new consumer habit
The sources provided previously unreported details of order volume targets, delivery plans and links to Reliance Retail's long-awaited IPO.
Reliance's bet is sparked by changing shopping trends. A recent Datum survey of 3,000 Indian quick commerce shoppers showed 36% had reduced shopping at supermarkets and 46% cut back purchases from mom-and-pop stores.
""Reliance is making an entry as quick commerce is already impacting modern retail and will also impact Reliance stores,"" said Satish Meena, an adviser at Datum.
Reliance is aiming for a 10-30 minute delivery window because it does not believe customers need orders within 10 minutes and the longer timeframe will help ensure the business is sustainable, said the first person.
Ambani wants to ensure quick commerce helps bolster its business ahead of an IPO of Reliance Retail, which was last year valued at $100 billion, has backers including KKR, two of the sources said.
Reliance runs the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in India's $600 billion grocery market, though it still plays catch-up with Amazon in e-commerce.
Reliance did not respond to Reuters' queries.
CHALLENGES
Reliance is betting a wider product portfolio at its supermarkets - some of which stock more than 10,000 items - will help distinguish its offering from smaller rivals, though it has decided not to add any new warehouses, the sources said.
Once expanded nationwide in coming months, Reliance expects quick commerce to help take daily orders on its JioMart app from around 200,000 now to roughly 500,000, said the second person.
Like he did with mobile data offerings, Ambani has a strong reputation of using cutthroat pricing to disrupt businesses he enters. But cracking quick commerce will not be easy.
Rahul Malhotra, a senior analyst at Bernstein, said quick commerce needs neighbourhood warehouses for fast deliveries under 10 minutes, so any large retailer will need to offer superior product selection and cheaper pricing to ensure customers are willing to wait for up to 30 minutes.
A former Reliance executive who declined to be named for fear of reprisal said many stores are multi-storied and items are located far from each other on shelves, making quick packaging difficult, a task further complicated by in-store crowds.
Inside two Reliance stores in Navi Mumbai, Reuters found distinct ""Q-Commerce"" areas have been created for stocking frequently ordered items such as noodles, dairy products and chocolates. Riders outside waited for app alerts to pick up orders.
Ajit Karande, a Reliance store manager, said an eight-member team had been tasked to ""completely focus on quick commerce"", adding ""we need to bill and pack the items within 10 minutes.""
Earlier visits to IPO-bound Swiggy's Instamart and Zomato's
Blinkit
warehouses by Reuters showed workers there are mandated to pack orders in under two minutes.
TOP RIDER, BOTTOM RIDER
The rapid quick commerce growth appears to be hitting the supermarket business.
Reliance Retail, which does not break down its grocery, fashion, electronics and telecom revenue, in October reported its first quarterly revenue decline in at least three years - a 1.1% fall in July-September sales to $9 billion.
Zomato's Blinkit sales surged 122% to $730 million in that period and recorded average growth of 103% in the last six quarters, when Reliance Retail's average stood at 13%, Bernstein said. But Reliance has reported profits for years, while Blinkit remains loss-making.
While Reliance has not commented on quick commerce stress, its rival DMart, which has 377 supermarkets, said this month it can ""clearly see the impact of online grocery formats"" on its big-city stores but has declined to compete in that area, leading several analysts to downgrade the stock.
Reliance's ""Hyperlocal"" grocery service has begun in a handful of Navi Mumbai and Bengaluru stores and will next be launched in cities like New Delhi and

, a fourth source said, adding there was a plan to incentivise its delivery drivers with weekly bonuses to boost the business.
The company also plans to rope in quick delivery startup Dunzo, in which it holds a near 26% stake, to further beef up its delivery fleet, said a fifth source. Dunzo declined comment.
To lure customers and trump rivals, Ambani is using free delivery.
In Mumbai, customers can use Reliance's JioMart app to get a 40 rupees ($0.48) can of Coca-Cola delivered free. Rivals impose levies such as ""small cart fee"" and ""high demand surge"" of up to 65 rupees on such an order.
At the Reliance store in Belapur near Mumbai, riders are tracked by the minute. A whiteboard inside names ""Top Picker"" and ""Top Rider"" to acknowledge efficiency, and ""Bottom Picker"" and ""Bottom Rider"" for slow work.
A ""customer order has to be delivered in 30 minutes,"" said Supriya Naik, a JioMart delivery executive.
""I need to run around a lot.""

Credvest Group ventures into interior design with the launch of Aiti Interieurs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/credvest-group-ventures-into-interior-design-with-the-launch-of-aiti-interieurs/articleshow/114732889.cms,29-10-2024,"Credvest Group expands its portfolio by foraying into the evolving interior design industry with the launch of Aiti Interieurs.
Expanding horizons
The introduction of Aiti Interieurs marks a timely and strategic expansion for Credvest, leveraging the company’s extensive experience in partnering with leading developers. This move into interior design aligns with Credvest’s growth trajectory and diversification, representing a new chapter in its journey.

Global designs made accessible
Aiti Interieurs redefines interior design by blending nature-inspired aesthetics with global sophistication, creating spaces that balance functionality and refined style.

Dhanteras fatafat: What's behind the 10-minute gold rush?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/dhanteras-fatafat-whats-behind-the-10-minute-gold-rush/articleshow/114726697.cms,29-10-2024,"A large number of people must have planned to buy gold on Dhanteras, not just because it's an auspicious occasion for such a purchase but also because gold has been on fire as equity markets fluctuate. Gold has given a whooping 30.6% returns in just a year from the previous Dhanteras, and 56.8% since
Dhanteras
in 2022. And it has become far easier to buy gold for common people.
Quick-commerce platforms Blinkit, BigBasket and Swiggy Instamart are now delivering gold and silver coins in just 10 minutes. Given the rally in
gold prices
and stock markets likely to correct, these platforms must have expected high demand for gold among common buyers on Dhanteras. Reportedly, BigBasket has collaborated with Tata-owned jeweller Tanishq; Swiggy Instamart has teamed up with
Malabar Gold
& Diamonds, Muthoot Exim and Jar; and Blinkit is delivering coins from Malabar Gold & Diamonds and Joyalukkas.
The 10-minute gold rush
When
quick commerce
gained shape in India during the Covid pandemic, a large section of the industry had written it off. Their argument was that Indian consumers were not going to pay convenience fees, no matter what. Some even insisted that consumers would happily wait for a few hours or even a day, if that meant they would get their orders delivered free. Today, one after the other, leading FMCG companies in their 2023-24 earnings report state that quick commerce is now not just their fastest growing channel, it is what is driving their e-commerce business growth itself, ET has reported.
The latest 10-minute gold rush comes when quick commerce firms are trying to diversify into new products. The companies which became popular for delivering groceries and other essential items within minutes are now venturing into delivery of high-value goods too. Last month, Zomato-owned Blinkit and BigBasket’s BBNow delivered the newly launched iPhone 16 in cities such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru on the very launch day of the new series when people usually queue up to buy iPhones.

As consumer habit for speed and convenience hardens, quick commerce firms eye delivery of bigger and more expensive products. They are already delivering small appliances and electronics.
The quick commerce market in India is currently valued at $3.34 billion and is projected to reach $9.95 billion by 2029, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 4.5 per cent over the forecast period (2024-2029).
Quick commerce companies spot a huge opportunity in the kitchen and small appliances segment, apart from handsets, television sets and microwave ovens, where e-commerce accounts for 35-45% of sales, according to industry executives. They are also planning to deliver white goods such as washing machines and refrigerators.
While they have already impacted small neighbourhood kirana stores and modern retail, quick commerce companies are now trying to compete with e-commerce platforms, especially when they are gearing up to deliver white goods. Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto have rolled out features like equated monthly installments (EMI), postpaid options and 10-minute returns for clothing and footwear to outcompete e-commerce firms. Blinkit has launched its seller programme called Seller Hub on the lines of ecommerce giant Amazon's FBA (fulfilled by Amazon),

Quick commerce platforms see surge in Diwali gift orders
More and more brands are starting to get on to the quick commerce bandwagon. Fabindia, Decathlon, Adidas, U.S. Polo Assn., Hamleys and BoAt have started offering their products on these platforms.
The 10-minute delivery of gold coins on Dhanteras indicates quick commerce firms are ready to gobble up all available retail spaces and products. The promise of quick commerce is drawing big corporates too. Tata is entering quick commerce with Neu Flash while Reliance is also reportedly considering this opportunity.
Speed bumps for quick commerce?
The latest 10-minute gold rush shows quick commerce firms are charged up to keep expanding at a breakneck speed. However, it could run into several speed breakers.
A recent report by JM Financial points out that more than three-four big players in quick commerce space appear unsustainable. Quick commerce players may have realised that they can't keep growing solely by offering convenience. They have been accused of offering deep discounts. Recently, All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), which represents 400,000 retail distributors of major companies including Nestle and Hindustan Unilever, has written to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that quick commerce firms were practising predatory pricing - or offering deep discounts and selling below cost to lure customers, Reuters has reported.
There are also concerns over viability of the quick commerce model in delivery of products which face high returns and 10-minute delivery of white goods which might pose complex logistic problems.

Quick-commerce risks: A lot can go wrong when everything arrives in 10 minutes,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-risks-a-lot-can-go-wrong-when-everything-arrives-in-10-minutes/articleshow/114709888.cms,29-10-2024,"Quick commerce
, the most powerful driving force of India’s consumer economy, is what happens when a 5,000-year civilization sets a 10-minute timer on gratification. Run out of sugar? Someone will zigzag through traffic to get it to you before the tea goes cold. No time for a diaper run?
Blinkit
has you covered. Or Zepto... or
Swiggy
Instamart.
Several such platforms are challenging the more established physical and online retailers. To have at least half a dozen options for quick commerce is a good thing in an economy where concentration of large monopolies and duopolies is on the rise. But what might seem like a gain for consumers is not a free lunch for the society. A 10-minute delivery has many hidden costs.
That’s no showstopper for the industry. Blinkit sales more than doubled from a year earlier in the September quarter, according to financials released last week by its owner
Zomato
Ltd., a $27 billion startup that began to trade publicly three years ago. The unit, which rushes everything from groceries and medicines to pet supplies in eight minutes, is now nearly half as big as food delivery, Zomato’s original business. It’s growing six times faster.
Swiggy Ltd., too, began as a food-delivery app. Instamart, which it started in two locations in 2020, has grown to cover 43 cities. And according to the prospectus of Swiggy’s much-awaited initial public offering, Instamart stocks nearly 20,000 items now, including electronics and wearables. That’s more than double from a year earlier. Back then, the average delivery time was nearly 17 minutes. In June, it fell to under 13 minutes.
Rapid expansion is drawing in both fresh-faced entrepreneurs and seasoned investors. Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global recently raised their stakes in Zepto, founded by two 19-year-old Stanford University dropouts who found themselves stuck at home during the pandemic. The quick-commerce startup is worth $5 billion, based on its last funding round in August.

This festive season get 10 min gold, silver delivery
I’m not convinced the economics of the 10-minute delivery will be able to withstand the relentless pressure of growth, especially in smaller cities and towns where the cost of warehousing a large number of goods may be too large compared with the size of the average order. The US market is littered with failures like Fridge No More, Buyk, Jokr, and Getir.
So far, though, the Indian model has shown surprising resilience. It’s as if Covid-19 flipped an impulse-buying switch in people’s heads. “Life is short,” is how late-medieval Europe reconciled itself to the ravages of Black Death, the 14th-century plague that led to a surge of consumerism in a pre-capitalist society. Glass panes appeared in the windows of working-class homes, and a scandalized state sought to limit the height of Venetian women’s platform shoes. That history has an echo in 21st-century capitalist India, where the smartphone seems to have became a tool of affirming one’s existence: “I am, because the delivery guy says so.”
Bloomberg
The durability of this behavioral change is not something the established retail players could foresee. Earlier this month, shares in Avenue Supermarts Ltd., also known as Dmart, fell the most in over five years after analysts got spooked by the severity of the quick-commerce onslaught. Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian who owns the country’s largest supermarket chain, has started a pilot run of under-30-minute grocery delivery, according to the Morning Context, a news portal. Ambani has shut down a similar service in the past.
Blinkit says its new “stores,” which are essentially retail partners that help fulfil demand in a neighborhood, break even when they reach 700,000 rupees ($8,300) in daily gross order value. The average for all its stores is nearing 1 million rupees a day. As some investors have noted, what started as “top-up” buying of milk, eggs and other frequently ordered items is now encroaching into “stock-up” purchases of higher-value staples ordered far less frequently. Brands like Adidas and Decathlon are queueing up for a ride, boosting the per-order amount.
The origin of India’s quick-commerce revolution is not purely psychological. It’s also financial, economic and social.
Trouble with other large bets, such as online education and fintech, is leading to faddish overinvestment in quick commerce. For the economy, it’s creating low-quality work amid a jobless recovery. India has only 1% of the world’s vehicles, but the largest number of deaths from road accidents. While the quick-commerce fleet is increasingly dominated by slower-moving electric two-wheelers, instantaneity is the top value proposition of quick commerce. And that won’t change.
On work conditions, contracts, and responding to delivery partners’ grievances, the industry is doing a better job than ride-hailing platforms like Uber Technologies Inc. and Ola, and
e-commerce
behemoths like Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart, according to Fairwork’s latest ratings. There are gaps, however, when it comes to letting riders earn at least the minimum wage. Collective bargaining remains a distant dream, and the traditional retail supply chain is so unhappy with being bypassed that it’s demanding an antitrust probe.
A lot can go wrong when 1.4 billion consumers start expecting even household appliances to arrive in 10 minutes, and are not willing to take stock of the consequences of their impatience. They might get more than they bargained for when the doorbell rings.

Bvlgari prioritises growth in India amid global luxury market trends,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/bvlgari-prioritises-growth-in-india-amid-global-luxury-market-trends/articleshow/114704301.cms,29-10-2024,"It is India versus the rest of the world when it comes to the parameters for luxury growth, and for Italian luxury brand Bvlgari, the first priority is to grow in India, said its chief executive
Jean-Christophe Babin
.
Bvlgari
on Monday announced the launch of its first
digital boutique
in India in partnership with
Tata CLiQ
Luxury. ""There are other promising markets for luxury, but the size and potential are a fraction of what India might become for western luxury,"" Babin said in an interview.
""The
luxury market
has grown a lot over the last decade and, driven by China, the boom has been extraordinary,"" he said. ""But China has reached a certain maturity, and it is undergoing a slowdown which is related not only to oversupply in real estate, but an oversupply across the board. We will get out of it, but given the maturity and the demographics, China like many other territories will normalise to single-digit growth.""
As an ambitious luxury company, Bvlgari wants to grow much more than the market, Babin said.
""We need an engine booster so that our growth is in double digits globally. And India for us is that booster. It is our fastest growing market in the world. It is not just the largest in terms of population, but if you consider parameters like education levels, GDP growth and the average incomes and their evolution, you have India and the rest of the world,"" he said.
""Because the scattering of wealth in India is even more varied and spread out than China, the potential of
luxury ecommerce
in India could be much more promising than China,"" he added.

It will also sell leather goods and other accessories.
Tata CLiQ CEO Gopal Asthana said the partnership with Bvlgari is a ""monumental step"" towards efforts to build luxury as a portfolio.
A large part of the business comes from beyond the top six cities. ""Almost 55% of our revenue comes from the non-metro markets. With this collaboration we are providing access to our consumers to a brand like Bvlgari which is known for its craftsmanship, innovation and a very strong Italian cultural heritage,"" he said. ""To enhance the customer experience, the platform will also have a concierge service with people trained by Bvlgari,"" he added.

"More Retail recast complete, plan to go for an IPO in two years: MD Vinod Nambiar",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/more-retail-recast-complete-plan-to-go-for-an-ipo-in-two-years-md-vinod-nambiar/articleshow/114703811.cms,29-10-2024,"Kolkata:
Amazon
and private equity firm Samara Capital-owned food and grocery retailer
More Retail
will go for an initial public offering (
IPO
) in the next 15-20 months having completed restructuring of the business including shutting down of loss-making large hypermarket stores and exiting non-grocery categories like general merchandise and apparel, said managing director
Vinod Nambiar
.
This has improved same-store growth, revenue and reduced losses from this fiscal.
The omni-channel retailer-which has become the preferred seller for
Amazon India
's food and grocery sales under Amazon Fresh-is also going to raise up to ₹200 crore from its existing promoters and new investors such as business family offices to support its expansion that includes setting up over 30
supermarket stores
spread over 2,000 square feet by March 2025 and another 120 in the next fiscal, Nambiar said. Last quarter, it had opened eight new supers.
As per registrar of companies (RoC) filings, the promoters infused ₹145 crore in More Retail thus far in the financial year. The total funding in FY24 was ₹387 crore, ₹300 crore in FY23 and ₹400 crore in FY22.
Nambiar said the restructuring exercise, which was started two fiscals ago, is now over. More had 41 large format hyper stores which has now come down to 20 and will further reduce to 11 by December. It will continue with these 11 outlets since they generate cash but will no longer open any new hyper stores.
Live Events
""We have perfected the model of expansion. The focus will be on small stores and the hybrid business as we are a partner of choice for Amazon wherever they roll out
Amazon Fresh
. General merchandise used to account for 30% of sales but it's now just 3%,"" he said.
As per More Retail's latest regulatory filing to the RoC, the company reported a slight reduction in net losses at ₹532 crore in FY24 from ₹550 crore in FY23. Revenue too dipped 8% year-on-year to ₹4,148 crore last fiscal. Nambiar attributed this to the restructuring exercise.
""This fiscal in the first half (April-September FY25), revenue grew 12% year-on-year despite a smaller store network, while we posted profit before tax of ₹4 crore. Our offline store business growth is now 9% and online is 86%. Same store growth was 17% YoY in first half of this fiscal. We expect Ebitda breakeven this quarter,"" said Nambiar.
More Retail at present runs 760 stores in 300 towns.
Around 25% of the company's business comes from online through Amazon Fresh, which in metros is over 30%. Samara and Amazon acquired More Retail from the Aditya Birla Group in 2019.
Nambiar said More already works with Amazon in 140 cities. He said More will help Amazon expand its Fresh business where the marketplace delivers in two hours.
""We haven't felt the impact of quick commerce since there are several Indian consumers who want value and are ready to wait for some time. Our prices online are the cheapest in food and grocery. Our average bill value through Amazon is two times that of quick commerce,"" he said.
More's business from Amazon has doubled between January and September this year. The company expects ecommerce contribution to total sales can potentially go up to 35%.

Premiumisation driving festive sales: Amazon,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/premiumisation-driving-festive-sales-amazon/articleshow/114690396.cms,28-10-2024,"Premiumisation
is driving
e-commerce sales
in the
festive season
, across categories such as jewellery, beauty, fashion, ethnic wear, watches and fragrances,
Amazon India
’s director, fashion and beauty, Zeba Khan, said.
She said sales of
gold and diamond jewellery
, including lab-grown diamonds, are seeing five times increase over last year, while sales of premium watches have grown six times over the previous year. “This reflects strong interest in
premium lifestyle products
.. we expect this momentum to continue,” Khan said. Amazon reported ""high demand"" in categories such as men’s sneakers, ethnic wear, trolley sets and luggage.
She said, however, that since the platform is seeing growth on “both sides of the price spectrum”, Amazon is pushing for larger play in affordable segments such as Bazaar for categories such as fashion and household products.
On how Amazon intends to compete with quick commerce platforms which are increasingly expanding their deliveries beyond just groceries, to include phones, apparel, footwear and household items, Khan said: “We understand that speed is a critical aspect for customers. But the e-commerce opportunity is so large; we’ll continue to focus on reliance, speed, selection and value.”
Researcher
Nielsen IQ
said in a report last week that
premium brands
are growing twice as fast as non-premium ones, in categories such as fast moving consumer goods, tech and durables, which it attributed to higher income levels, urbanisation, smartphone penetration, and a more
aspirational consumer
base.

“We are observing an increasing convergence of aspirational consumer preferences with higher disposable incomes, as well as presence and access to premium products,” Roosevelt Dsouza, commercial head – India, NielsenIQ, said.
“This shift is driven by
digital platforms
, contributing to nearly half of the sales. Market mix, channel diversity, and new entrants will further drive the adoption of premiumisation in the future,” Dsouza added.

"Quick commerce solution for different use cases, categories; not where Nykaa wants to jump in:  CEO Falguni Nayar",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-solution-for-different-use-cases-categories-not-where-nykaa-wants-to-jump-in-ceo-falguni-nayar/articleshow/114621487.cms,26-10-2024,"Quick Commerce
model is solving ""very different"" use cases and suited to broader product categories like groceries and items of daily use,
Nykaa
founder and CEO
Falguni Nayar
said, emphasising it is not a format that the
beauty and fashion
platform wants to jump into. Nykaa is continuously focused on improving
delivery timelines
, being closer to customers and building out an extensive network, Nayar said.
Indian consumers are on a ""premiumisation"" journey in every category, seeking better quality and more out of the offerings, she said, outlining the megatrends shaping the beauty and fashion space.
In an interview with PTI on the sidelines 'Nykaaland' -- a star-studded affair showcasing brands, new styles, debuts and master classes with internationally acclaimed makeup artists -- Nayar said the event, running its second edition this year, is expected to draw more visitors, footfalls and brand participation.
""Like in our business itself, we've said the best of beauty and fashion should be available to Indian consumers, and we work very hard to bring a lot of international brands into the country.
""We are also the platform of choice for great D2C brands, which are coming up in the country...beauty is a very inclusive world, and from international brands to our local brands to best of what the beauty and fashion have to offer, are all present here,"" she said about the convergence of brands, consumers, creators, and beauty communities at 'Nykaaland 2.0'.
Live Events
To a broader question on how she sees competition from quick commerce companies - that are wooing Indian consumers with super-fast turnaround and deliveries, Nayar said, ""We definitely think quick commerce is more about a wider set of SKUs, which includes groceries and everyday goods, which is not where Nykaa wants to jump in"".
Nayar believes quick commerce is solving for a very different use case.
""...beauty includes what we call beauty and personal care. And personal care products all over the world have always been sold at neighbourhood stores, including pharmacies, and there are...certain types of SKUs that customers pick up in the neighbourhood stores. So, I think what quick commerce is solving for is a very different use case,"" she said.
That said, Nykaa is aiming for rapid and express deliveries.
""We are talking about it, and that definitely is our promise to the customers,"" she said.
Nykaa's top boss said that while the young digital-first population of Gen Z and millennials have a preference towards buying online, the most successful models will have an omnichannel approach in serving customers ""where they are"".
""We have to be where consumers are. Nykaa would have earlier thought that we could have one Luxe store in South Bombay, and today we... before we know...we'll have four, five Luxe stores in South Mumbai alone.
""So, I think the scale of operation is changing as the industry is growing larger, both for beauty and fashion and you'll see that most successful models will have an omnichannel approach to serving consumers where they are,"" she said.
Nayar's entrepreneurial leap with Nykaa saw her tapping into an underserved beauty retail market, and the platform has since then expanded its offerings to include lifestyle and B2B by introducing online platforms Nykaa Fashion, Nykaa Man, and Superstore.
""What we call a speciality beauty retailing with the convenience of e-commerce is what Nykaa started at. We chose to be a vertical player. We do believe that customer journeys where discovery is very important...consumers discover the best and most suitable product for them...that is the premise under which we built both our vertical apps of beauty and fashion. That's why we went ahead with a separate app for beauty and a separate app for fashion. And I think we are big believers in that,"" she said.
Nykaa has 35 million customers on the platform, and it operates in 200 stores.
Nayar said Nykaa's physical retail accounts for less than 10 per cent of its turnover.
""India is a very large, geographically diverse market, and trying to cater to 10-minute delivery in certain metros is a very different use case. So far, players like us...we are helping more than 2,000 brands grow and launch in the country on the beauty side, similar numbers on the fashion side...and similarly, we cater to all the PIN codes,"" she said.
Nykaa has scaled up from 15 warehouses to 44 today over the past years and is constantly focused on improving delivery timelines.
""There is a whole size and scale at which we operate in the beauty industry, and if consumers are looking at faster delivery, obviously with the volumes that we have, we'll keep solving for it.
""Over the last few years itself, we have moved from 15 warehouses to 44 today, and most of our deliveries are affected by that ability to be closer to the customer within the state that they reside in, and that's helped us improve our delivery timelines by 45 per cent, and the same journey will continue,"" she said.
On the festive season uptick, Nayar said the demand momentum is expected to continue beyond Diwali.
""...the festive season is doing well. But as you are aware, the festive season is early this year, and one has to really look beyond festive. And I do believe that the wedding season this year was more concentrated in the second half. So, most of us remain very enthusiastic about the momentum continuing beyond the Diwali festive season,"" she added.

RIL’s ‘quick’ retail fix: Expat coaches,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/rils-quick-retail-fix-expat-coaches/articleshow/114598190.cms,26-10-2024,"India’s largest retailer
Reliance Retail
has tapped several expatriates with retail experience from Europe, US and South Asia in a bid to streamline its
grocery supply chain
operations, enhance the
online fashion business
Ajio and improve margins, two industry executives said. Some of these expats have also been entrusted to coach a pool of young Indian leaders for a top leadership
succession planning
exercise started recently by the retail business of
Reliance Industries Ltd
, the executives said.
At least five chief executives at Reliance Retail in their late 50s and 60s may move to mentoring roles as advisors or superannuate over the next few years. The initiatives at Reliance Retail come at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers, including Reliance, and Avenue Supermarts Ltd—the owner of DMart retail chain—are facing intense challenges in grocery retail from
quick commerce
platforms in large cities amid a subdued demand environment.
Reliance Retail has also slowed down expansion and sharply increased
store closures
this fiscal, resulting in only 110 net store additions in the first half of this fiscal year though it had opened 795 stores. This means store closures exceeded store openings by over six times. Last year, in the same period, the company reported net store additions of 610 outlets when it had opened 1,026 stores. The company had noted a weak apparel and footwear business in a quarterly earnings call earlier this month.
“Some 20-30 professionals—some expats and some from within India—have recently joined as consultants to work on supply chain, finance, operations, category, inventory management and most importantly, margins,” one of the executives told ET. Reliance Retail has also started a succession planning for the top leadership even though there is no formal retirement age in the company. This is because many of its top management are in their late 50s and 60s, and the company wants to appoint young leaders. One of the roles that’s likely to see a new leader over the next few years is managing director for Reliance Retail Ventures—the holding company of all retail and FMCG business of Reliance—a position currently held by V Subramaniam. The following roles may also see changes: Chief executive officer of grocery retail, which is now headed by Damodar Mall; electronics retail business CEO led by Brian Bade, and lifestyle and fashion retail business CEO presently led by Akhilesh Prasad.

The others are CEO of Ajio, a role held by Vineeth Nair and Reliance Trends chief operating officer, currently led by Vipin Tyagi. “It is still not decided when these executives will move to a mentoring role but like every big organisation, a succession planning has recently started. They themselves are grooming the successors along with the
expat coaches
,” a second executive said. He said the large size of Reliance Retail and complex organisational structure has necessitated the involvement of expats. Reliance Retail didn’t respond to ET’s queries. The company runs over 18,946 stores spanning grocery, consumer electronics and apparel. It is the largest in India by number of stores, sales and profit. There are also plans for a public listing but parent RIL has yet to take a final decision. While Reliance Retail occasionally utilises the expertise of expats to regroup its business, it is after several years that so many of them have joined the company in one go, the executives said, adding that these expats have mostly joined as consultants.
“The timing is important. The July-September quarter has been particularly harsh for most retailers due to weak consumption, specifically in urban markets. The ten-minute delivery promise from quick commerce companies such as Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy Instamart is swiftly changing buying habits of consumers in top 15-20 cities where these companies service,” the first person said. Established retailers such as Reliance and Amazon are yet to start 10-15 minute delivery though the former has started testing the model.

"Zomato misses mark in Hyderabad, Chennai; shifts focus to business growth",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/zomato-misses-mark-in-hyderabad-chennai-shifts-focus-to-business-growth/articleshow/114464964.cms,22-10-2024,"Zomato
has said that the
food delivery
company is currently not as focused on
market share
as on growing the business. The comments come in the light of the Deepinder Goyal-owned firm falling short in two of the major metropolitan cities in the country -
Hyderabad
and
Chennai
, it informed during a conference call post Q2 exchange filing on Tuesday.
However, according to the gross order value (GOV) data from the second quarter of FY25, Zomato stood as the largest player in all the other major metropolitan cities in India.
""We are less focused on market share at the moment, and more focused on growing the business...Zomato was the largest player in all major metros except Hyderabad, Chennai according to GOV,"" the company said in the conference call.
Zomato
reported a 389 per cent increase in consolidated
net profit
, reaching Rs 176 crore in the second quarter, up from Rs 36 crore a year ago. However, this figure fell short of market expectations, which had estimated a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 260 crore. Revenue from operations surged by 68 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 4,799 crore during the same period.
This growth in net profit was attributed to rising food delivery margins, while the quick commerce segment remained close to breakeven. The gross order value (GOV) for Zomato’s B2C businesses grew by 55 per cent YoY to Rs 17,670 crore in Q2FY25. Excluding the effects of the acquisition of Paytm’s entertainment ticketing business, the GOV growth was 53 per cent YoY.

Breaking it down by segments, the food delivery business achieved an adjusted revenue growth of 21 per cent YoY, totaling Rs 2,340 crore, with a GOV increase of 21 per cent YoY to Rs 9,690 crore.
In addition, Zomato's quick commerce arm, Blinkit, experienced a remarkable 129 per cent YoY growth in adjusted revenues, reaching Rs 1,156 crore, while its GOV rose by 122 per cent YoY to Rs 6,132 crore.
Zomato highlighted that while many of its stores are profitable and margins are expanding, overall margin growth is being tempered by ongoing investments aimed at scaling infrastructure.

“The retail landscape remains favourable for growth, and energizing consumer demand will be a key to driving long-term success in the industry.

Govt in talks to sell Bharat brand food through Reliance Retail outlets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/govt-in-talks-with-reliance-retail-to-sell-bharat-products/articleshow/114437831.cms,22-10-2024,"The government is in advanced talks with
Reliance Retail
to sell the Bharat brand of food items such as atta, rice and pulses through the
outlets
of the Mukesh Ambani-controlled retail chain at
subsidised prices
to tame
inflation
, said a person familiar with the matter.
While there have previously been short-term arrangements with ecommerce firms including Reliance’s JioMart, Amazon and BigBasket to push Bharat brand products for price stabilisation, mostly during elections, this is the first time that the government is looking at a long-term arrangement with a private retailer to sell food products from its buffer stock at subsidised prices. The government is also looking at initiating talks with retail chain DMart and other grocery retailers for similar arrangements, the person said.
Reliance did not comment did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The Bharat Brand is a label launched by the government to provide food grains and other essential goods to the middle class at subsidised prices, which the government decides depending on prevailing market prices and procurement costs.
It launched Bharat Atta, Bharat Dal and Bharat Rice for retail sales in 2023 when high food inflation started hurting the general public, especially those who are not below the poverty line and so not eligible for free grains under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana.

Bharat-branded products are currently sold by the National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) through their own outlets and Kendriya Bhandar, including mobile stores.
“Tying up with a large retailer will increase the reach of the Bharat Brand products, making them available to more people,” said the person cited earlier.
Reliance Industries’ retail subsidiary operates more than 2,700 grocery stores and sells fresh fruits & vegetables, dairy and cereals to spices, processed food & beverages and home & personal care products, according to its website.
As a part of the deal, Reliance Retail will help the government in managing and improving its supply chain, storage, packaging, quality control and distribution, the person said.
Products under the Bharat brand are priced significantly lower than those of other market players. Bharat Rice was sold at Rs 29 a kilogram when it was launched earlier this year when other brands were priced at Rs 40 to Rs 110. Bharat Atta and Bharat Chana Dal were sold at Rs 27.50 and Rs 60 per kg, respectively, compared with more than Rs 40 and over Rs 100 in the open market.
While government-procured wheat and rice are offered free of cost to about 807 million beneficiaries below the poverty line through a network of 538,000 fair price shops, there is a large section of consumers belonging to the middle class who are not eligible for free ration. They are the main target of the Bharat brand products.

DMart will be a test case amid India's raging retail wars,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/dmart-will-be-a-test-case-amid-indias-raging-retail-wars/articleshow/114422214.cms,21-10-2024,"India's retail sector is in ferment. As a largely unorganised sector slowly transforms into an organised one, new trends are triggering tectonic shifts. Disappointing September-quarter earnings of Avenue Supermarts, which owns and operates highly successful retail chain DMart, are seen to have been driven by disruptions from online delivery platforms and quick commerce players.
Avenue Supermarts
shares have been hit by several downgrades from various brokerage firms.
Avenue Supermarts reported a 5.78% increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 659.44 crore for the quarter ended September 2024. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 623.35 crore a year ago. Its revenue from operations rose 14.41% to Rs 14,444.50 crore during the quarter under review. It was Rs 12,624.37 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal. Total income, which includes other income, rose 14.34% to Rs 14,478.02 crore.The company's standalone revenues grew 14.2%, lower than the 18.4% growth recorded during the quarter to June. The Ebitda margin stood at 7.9%, down from 8.9% in the preceding quarter and 8.1% in the year-ago period.

Will quick commerce eat up modern trade? The less-than-expected DMart performance is being seen as a direct result of a growing challenge from quick commerce firms to modern trade.

Online onslaught on modern trade
Sales growth of groceries, personal products and home care items in modern trade and supermarkets slowed down to a four-year low in July and August, hurt by consumers' shift to online channels, especially quick commerce, and retailers shutting down hundreds of stores to improve profitability over the past year, ET has reported recently. Sales in modern trade increased 3.2% during July and August, compared to 24% a year ago, executives quoting latest available NeilsenIQ data have told ET.
With a rising proportion of Indian consumer purchases getting unplanned and of low-to-moderate order value, there has been an increase in demand for instant fulfilment, served by quick commerce players such as Zepto, Swiggy Instamart and Blinkit. For most FMCG companies, online channels are now nearly 10-12% of overall sales and quick commerce platforms account for a third of that. Modern trade accounts for 12-15% of FMCG sales.
""Within online, quick commerce has been really disruptive. Compared to a year ago, when ecommerce sales accounted for a fifth of our sales, the channel now contributes nearly a third, on a par with general trade and modern trade. There has been consolidation of modern trade stores as well as they focus more on return on investment and profitability,"" Aditya Bagri, director at Bagrrys, which sells muesli, oats and cornflakes, has told ET recently.
The value-versus-convenience battle
As per an analysis by ET Intelligence Group, investors can wait for the festival-driven second-half performance to gauge the resilience of the performance of DMart. There is an inherent seasonality in DMart's performance with the second half of the fiscal year (October to March) being better than the first half (between April and September). Also, DMart has largely maintained the shares of their key product categories for the first half of this year over the past year.

Avenue Supermarts becoming like Costco & Walmart in US: Pashupati Advani
It appears DMart is not too worried about the challenge posed by quick commerce. The company is not foraying into quick commerce any time soon and instead focuses on opening more stores to cover catchments and clusters where quick commerce players are seeing high demand. It expects discounting and lower pricing instead of convenience to drive growth.
DMart believes discounting and lower pricing will drive its growth and not convenience through faster delivery. Avenue Supermarts, the owner of DMart, has said it will keep the focus on opening more stores to cover catchments and clusters where quick commerce companies are currently seeing high demand. It will continue to focus on being a value retailer, consciously choosing not to adopt a deep discounting strategy like some ecommerce players either, said Avenue Supermarts CEO and managing director Neville Noronha a few months ago. ""Quick commerce is about convenience and not discount. They are giving excellent convenience. So, some top-end or affluent consumers who shop from DMart might fall off,"" Noronha had told investors in July. ""DMart is all about value, even if it's a bit inconvenient.""
DMart has been crunching data for the last two years to gauge whether the new format is affecting it. ""Surprisingly, it is not, and if there is anything that impacts us, it's our own ability to operate stores or a store not run well,"" Noronha said.
The battle between value and convenience playing out in India's retail sector will be watched keenly as India's second biggest listed retailer, after
Trent
recently emerged number one, powers ahead amid the challenge from quick commerce.
Within the physical retail channel, DMart has better operational metrics such as cost to sales or invested capital than Aldi and Lidl, the German retailers that are often seen as benchmarks for discount retailing and run some of the leanest retail operations globally, as per a recent ET report. Pashupati Advani, Founder, Global Foray, has told ET Now recently that DMart is becoming more like Costco and Walmart in the US. He said it is making a large amount of net profit from non-food items such as garments, underwears and socks but fully moving into other segments may take time. Also, in the ecommerce business, it is competing with Amazon, Flipkart and Big Basket that count deep discounting as their core strategy. Unlike rivals that rely on a delivery-based distribution model, DMart's online venture operates a hybrid model with delivery centres in areas where it has small stores, where customers can also pick up items ordered online.
A recent report by JM Financial points out that more than three-four big players in quick commerce space appear unsustainable. Quick commerce players may have realised that they can't keep growing solely by offering convenience. They have been accused of offering deep discounts. Recently, All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), which represents 400,000 retail distributors of major companies including
Nestle
and
Hindustan Unilever
, has written to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that quick commerce firms were practising predatory pricing - or offering deep discounts and selling below cost to lure customers, Reuters reported.
The battles in India's retail sector will keep raging as Indian consumers change habits and more Indians adopt digital payments as telecom and digital commerce players keep penetrating unreached areas. However, multiple retail formats might exist as long as they cater to unique needs of their customers. For instance, credit can keep local kirana alive in rural areas while the need to touch and feel products may remain a challenge for digital retail. Modern trade was once expected to kill traditional retail, the kiranas; e-commerce was expected to push down both modern retail and kirana; and now quick commerce is seen to be threatening the other three segments. Large-scale and permanent shifts in the retail landscape will be visible only after a long time, and for now different formats might coexist even as the retail wars rage on. The performance of modern retail giant DMart in coming years will certainly be a big indicator of the future shape of the retail sector.

Gen Z: Brands chase 37.7 crore Indians for the $1.4 trillion money they may spend,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/gen-z-brands-chase-37-7-crore-indians-for-the-1-4-trilion-money-they-may-spend/articleshow/114414708.cms,21-10-2024,"India’s massive
Gen Z
population, currently estimated at 37.7 crore, is reshaping the country’s consumer landscape. As more of them join the workforce, brands are scrambling to cater to this new, influential demographic that is expected to drive a substantial portion of India’s consumer spending. According to a joint report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Snap Inc., Gen Z already influences a staggering 43% of household consumption, contributing $860 billion to the economy, of which $200 billion comes directly from their own earnings.

The report further estimates that by 2030, around 36% of India’s Gen Z will be part of the workforce, driving an impressive $730 billion in direct spending and a total of $1.4 trillion when including influenced spends. These figures make it clear why brands are working to position themselves as Gen Z favorites, as this cohort is expected to shape the future of consumer behavior in India.
As India’s Gen Z continues to grow in economic influence, brands are being forced to rethink their strategies. Personalization, affordability, and trend responsiveness have become critical in winning over this tech-savvy generation.

Amazon, Flipkart's plans
E-commerce majors like Amazon and Flipkart are taking aggressive steps to capture the attention of this app-savvy, ""swipe-up"" generation. Amazon Fashion has rolled out a specialised Next Gen store, while Flipkart has launched Spoyl, an app-in-app fashion platform aimed at young shoppers. Flipkart’s fashion subsidiary Myntra has also introduced Fwd, a platform specifically tailored for Gen Z. The focus on catering to Gen Z’s online shopping habits reflects their significant role in driving the growth of India’s e-commerce sector.

For Meesho, one of India’s leading online marketplaces, Gen Z shoppers represent a key audience, with one in every three users being under the age of 25. Zeba Khan, director of fashion and beauty at Amazon India, noted a “threefold jump” in
Gen Z customers
after the launch of the Next Gen store. She also emphasized the challenges of targeting this group, saying, “India's diverse demographics pose a challenge for fashion brands targeting Gen Z... price sensitivity is a key factor with a significant portion of the population which seeks value for money and affordable options,” Khan told ToI.
Social media’s influence on Gen Z
Gen Z’s relationship with technology is fundamentally different from previous generations. As digital natives, they’ve grown up in a world where swiping, scrolling, and sharing are second nature. Social media platforms, particularly Instagram and Snapchat, play a central role in shaping their preferences, behaviors, and purchasing decisions. Their inclination towards social media-driven consumption is evident as brands across sectors, from fashion to consumer electronics, adapt their strategies to engage with this highly connected audience.
Aman Gupta, co-founder and chief marketing officer at wearable brand BoAt, flagged how Gen Z’s preferences are reshaping industries. “The preferences, behaviours and aspirations of Gen Zs are reshaping industries and we are designing our business strategy with them at the core... we are prioritising personalisation, affordability and durability - key factors Gen Z value in their purchases,” Gupta told ToI, adding that Gen Z is expected to contribute significantly to BoAt’s revenue in the next three to five years. This trend is amplified by the growing use of wearable technology among younger consumers.
The power of social media influence is undeniable. Brands that fail to resonate with Gen Z’s values or seem overly commercial risk being “cancelled” by this generation. Gaurav Khatri, co-founder of Noise, a homegrown wearable brand, explained, “They are quick to dismiss brands that feel disconnected or overly commercial. This requires us to stay agile, constantly innovating our products.”
Festive Season: A goldmine for brands
As India enters the festive season, brands are gearing up to capitalise on the surge in consumer spending driven by Gen Z. Dhruv Dhawan, Head of Ads at Disney+ Hotstar India, predicts a 47% increase in spending during the three-month festive window, with an average budget of Rs 25,000. This period represents a golden opportunity for brands to tap into the shopping spirit of this young, app-first generation.
Gen Z’s consumption patterns differ significantly from their millennial predecessors. Nandita Sinha, CEO of Myntra, noted that Gen Z shoppers buy eight to nine times a year, compared to the five to six annual purchases made by millennials. This accelerated buying cycle is fueled by their exposure to global trends and their quick adoption of new products.
Contrary to the belief that Gen Z lacks disposable income, over 70% of them engage in side hustles, making them a lucrative target for brands. Their propensity for frequent purchases combined with their focus on trends over brand loyalty makes them a dynamic and challenging audience for marketers to keep engaged.
From fashion to tech: Gen Z's wide reach
The influence of Gen Z spans a broad range of sectors beyond fashion. According to Nimisha Jain, senior partner and managing director at BCG, their impact is evident in industries ranging from automobiles to consumer durables. For Gen Zs, trends score over brands, making the job tougher for companies to keep them hooked, she said.
This sentiment is echoed by Danny Jacob, head of marketing at Titan’s Fastrack, which has introduced sub-brands and targeted campaigns to capture more of the Gen Z market. Fastrack’s recent product launches, such as the Fleek and Gambit collections, as well as the brand Vyb, have significantly boosted revenues, driven in part by Gen Z shoppers.

Tata Consumer won't sacrifice market share: MD Sunil D'Souza,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tata-consumer-wont-sacrifice-market-share-md-sunil-dsouza/articleshow/114359720.cms,19-10-2024,"Mumbai:
Tata Consumer Products
managing director Sunil D'Souza said Reliance Industries-owned
Campa Cola
has disrupted the
beverages market
by offering a significantly higher margin to retailers on its ₹10 pack, forcing other players to reset their pricing.
""While the ₹10 (price) was the same to the consumer, the trade price was dramatically different. So, the other big multinationals adapted their pricing on the trade very, very quickly but we did not,"" D'Souza told analysts on Friday during a post-results call.
The company that sells the flavoured glucose drink
Tata Gluco Plus
said its price to retailers was at about 30% premium to competitors and about 20% higher to the multinationals. It had to finally correct the price to protect market share, he said, adding: ""We are here for the long haul, and will not forgo market share. We have taken down prices.""
Its ready-to-drink segment which includes Tata Gluco Plus posted an 11% decline in sales during the quarter ended September 30.

Tata Consumer, which also sells packaged groceries from salt and staples to water and tea and operates Starbucks' India outlets under a joint venture, said it has either recently increased or is planning to increase prices in tea, coffee and salt to offset rising input costs amid erratic weather conditions.
The company's sales grew 13% during the quarter to ₹4,215 crore while net profit remained almost flat at ₹367 crore. Its India business rose 2% excluding acquisitions. The India beverages business reported 3% revenue growth, though it declined 4% excluding Organic India due to a subdued demand environment. Coffee revenue rose 29%.
From predominantly selling tea, coffee and salt a few years ago,
Tata Consumer
expanded into pulses, spices as well as ready-to-cook and drink product categories. Also, more recently, it entered snacking products.
The company said it has seen green shoots in rural areas, but
urban markets
remained under stress.
""Rural is recovering from where it was. I think a good monsoon, and therefore the kharif crop, is only going to help in the rural recovery, but it is still not at the stage where it gives us a double-digit volume growth, and a penetration growth, etc. But while this has happened, urban has softened. And we are probably underestimating the stress on the consumer in terms of food inflation, etc.,"" said D'Souza.
With 457 outlets, Tata Starbucks is now the largest organised cafe operator in India, it said.
""Stress is being seen across the QSR (quick-service restaurant) segments. I think it's an overall consumer spending issue, especially in urban areas. Food inflation is higher than what we think it is, and the impact is far higher. And, therefore, there is a tightening of the belt,"" D'Souza added.
The company said it completed the integration of newly acquired businesses with strong synergy and margin expansion, which led to growth of 25% in Capital Foods and 45% in Organic India.

Is India the next premium goldmine to put money? Foot Locker and Estée Lauder may think so,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/is-india-the-next-premium-goldmine-to-put-money-foot-locker-and-este-lauder-may-think-so/articleshow/114338961.cms,18-10-2024,"At a time when global giants like
Foot Locker
and Estée Lauder are recalibrating their strategies in established markets, India has emerged as a promising battleground. These brands, known for their dominance in the sneaker and beauty industries, are turning their attention to India’s expanding consumer base, youthful population, and increasing demand for premium products.
Foot Locker, the American retailer famous for its wide selection of sneakers
, is placing significant bets on India’s growing sneaker culture. This comes at a time when the company is retreating from markets like South Korea and parts of Europe, in favor of focusing on core regions. So, why India?
Mary Dillon, the global CEO of Foot Locker, noted that Indian consumers are increasingly seeking sneakers like Jordans and Sambas, moving beyond a simple sports shoe culture, ET reported. This shift mirrors trends previously observed in the US and China.
Foot Locker, the New York-based athletic retailer, is expanding into India through a long-term licensing agreement with
Metro Brands
, which will manage and operate Foot Locker stores in the country. Additionally,
Nykaa Fashion
has been designated as its exclusive e-commerce partner.
Mary Dillon, the president and CEO of Foot Locker, has been vocal about the company’s enthusiasm for India. In a recent interview, Dillon described India as a key growth market, praising its position as the fifth-largest consumer market globally. “As we think about the next 50 years, I am being very careful, making sure we place our resources and efforts in the right places, and we think India is one of those,” she explained. With a large, young population and rising purchasing power, India presents an opportunity for brands like Foot Locker to scale. ""It is an amazing country in so many ways,"" Dillon said.
Live Events
The sneaker trend in India is expanding rapidly. While sneakers were once considered casual or athletic wear, today they’ve infiltrated corporate and social scenes alike. From Gen Z fashion enthusiasts to office goers and socialites, sneakers have become the go-to accessory for all occasions, from work to weekend parties. Recognising this shift, Foot Locker is tapping into a market where fashion-forward trends are increasingly driving consumer choices.

By joining forces with local partners, Foot Locker is hoping to tailor its offerings to the unique preferences of Indian consumers, maximizing its chances for success in a competitive market.
Estée Lauder eyes India’s beauty boom
Another global giant making significant strides in India is Estée Lauder. Known for its luxury skincare, makeup, and fragrance brands like MAC, Clinique, and Bobbi Brown, Estée Lauder has been operating in India for nearly 20 years. Now, it’s ready to take things a step further.
Also Read:
Estée Lauder will soon start local manufacturing in India
Stéphane de La Faverie, Executive Group President at The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., recently revealed the company’s plans to start local manufacturing in India, ET reported. This move comes as part of a broader strategy to capture a larger share of India’s burgeoning beauty market. The company is piloting local manufacturing with a partner in India, Faverie disclosed during a recent visit to the country. The decision to produce locally reflects both the growing demand for premium beauty products in India and the company’s intent to make its offerings more accessible to a wider range of consumers.
India’s beauty market has experienced a boom in recent years, spurred in part by the rise of e-commerce platforms like Nykaa, which have made beauty and skincare products accessible across the country. Faverie noted that Estée Lauder now reaches over 19,000 zip codes in India, a feat that would have been impossible with physical retail alone. As India’s middle class expands, and more women join the workforce, the demand for prestige beauty products is expected to rise even further.
In addition to local manufacturing, Estée Lauder is catering to the Indian market by offering a range of price points, including smaller-sized products that are more affordable for first-time buyers. This strategy allows the company to appeal to both high-end consumers and those looking for more budget-friendly options. With a combination of online and offline stores, Estée Lauder is well-positioned to thrive in India’s growing beauty sector.
The Make in India push
Both Foot Locker and Estée Lauder’s focus on India aligns with the government’s “Make in India” initiative, which aims to transform the country into a global manufacturing hub. By encouraging foreign investment and boosting local production, the initiative has successfully attracted global brands to establish a footprint in India.
For Estée Lauder, local manufacturing is a critical part of its growth strategy, allowing it to reduce costs and cater to a broader consumer base. Similarly, Foot Locker’s partnerships with Indian companies Metro Brands and Nykaa underscore the importance of collaborating with local players to navigate the complexities of the Indian market.
The
Make in India
push has also helped improve infrastructure and ease of doing business, making the country an attractive destination for global retailers looking to expand their presence in Asia. As India continues to develop its manufacturing capabilities, more international brands are likely to follow in the footsteps of Foot Locker and Estée Lauder.
Premiumisation and India’s growing affluent class
One of the key reasons why international brands are betting big on India is the rise of premiumisation. As India’s economy grows and disposable incomes increase, consumers are increasingly gravitating toward premium products. This trend, which accelerated during the pandemic, shows no signs of slowing down.
From luxury cars to high-end beauty products, India’s affluent class is willing to spend on premium items that offer quality and exclusivity. This is especially true in urban centers, where malls featuring international luxury brands have become status symbols. Foot Locker’s entry into India is a direct response to the growing demand for premium fashion, while Estée Lauder’s expansion caters to consumers who are willing to invest in high-end beauty products.
What’s particularly noteworthy is that premiumisation is not limited to major cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Small-town India is also witnessing a surge in demand for luxury goods, thanks to rising incomes and improved access to global brands. This shift presents a golden opportunity for international retailers looking to tap into a vast and diverse consumer base.
For Foot Locker and Estée Lauder, India represents more than just a new market—it’s a critical growth engine for the future. Both companies are betting that the country’s youthful population, expanding middle class, and rising demand for premium products will drive long-term success.

Jayanti Spices and
Hyfun Foods
currently have products under Walmart's
Great Value
brand.
Walmart, Executive Vice President, Sourcing, Andrea Albright said: ""As part of our goal to increase exports from India to USD 10 billion per year by 2027, we are excited to bring a taste of India's rich culture and traditions to our customers in the US during the holiday season and beyond"".
These products from Indian food brands and suppliers are being sold in Walmart's US stores, Sam's Club and also online through Walmart.com.
From the house of Britannia Industries, Walmart will sell products, such as Bourbon chocolate cream-filled biscuits, Good Day cookies and classic Milk Rusk during Diwali.
Besides, Britannia will also provide family packs in select US stores.
From Bikano, Walmart will introduce two festive packs -- Abhinandan and Shahi Nazrana -- for its select US stores this Diwali.
""These curated collections feature traditional Indian savouries, mixtures, and sweets such as Soan Papdi and Gulab Jamun,"" it said.
Jayanti Spices, a Coimbatore-based supplier, has successfully expanded into the US market under Walmart's Great Value private label. It offers a variety of flavourful spices and herbs, including onion powder, garlic powder, cinnamon powder, crushed red pepper, parsley flakes, black pepper, and cinnamon sticks, bringing spices grown in India to US consumers, Walmart said in a statement.
Vahdam, a premium brand specialising in tea, spices and herbs, is already a favourite at Walmart.
""The brand offers a wide range of spices and powders, including cumin, clove, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, garlic, onion, amla, and ashwagandha, along with tea products like Turmeric Ashwagandha, Turmeric Ginger, and Turmeric Citrus Ginger and Tumeric Tea variety pack in Walmart stores,"" the statement said.
HyFun, a Gujarat-based frozen foods brand and first-time exporter to the US market, will also be available under the Great Value brand, offering products like tater tots and seasoned hash browns at a great price.

"Trend towards mass casualization to fuel growth of Foot Locker in India, says global chief",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/trend-towards-mass-casualization-to-fuel-growth-of-foot-locker-in-india-says-global-chief/articleshow/114313427.cms,17-10-2024,"Foot Locker
global chief executive
Mary Dillon
said Indians are increasingly demanding
sneakers
such as Jordans and Samba, going beyond just having a sports shoes culture, mimicking the trend seen in the US and China many years ago.
Foot Locker, a New York-based athletic retailer, is entering into
India
through a long-term licensing agreement with
Metro Brands
which will own and operate Foot Locker stores in India while
Nykaa Fashion
will be its exclusive
e-commerce
partner. Dillon said that the trend towards mass casualization, which, covid accelerated, will fuel the growth of the company in India.
“People enter this category and see that sneakers could play a role in their everyday life. We expect these trends will continue. We are also seeing as a multi branded retailer, once people enter the category, they'd like to buy multiple brands,” said Dillon adding that India is a very high priority new market.
“The Indian consumer is going to see the best at Foot Locker. I think the time is right for us, going into a market like India, which is obviously large and growing, but very complex. India is the fifth largest consumer market in the world. So the opportunity for consumption and purchase of sneakers we see is quite big. The category is growing, and it's expected to continue to grow,"" she told ET.
The company might introduce new brands including those which it sells globally but are still not sold in India. ET had first reported in February 2023 about Footlocker's entry in India with Metro.
Live Events
“When you look at the sneaker markets in advanced nations, like China or like the US, right, it's far more developed. It tells you that the runway for growth is huge, the sneaker consumption in the market today is very small. Comparatively, footwear consumption in general is very low but it's just on its way up,” said Nissan Joseph, CEO, Metro Brands.
The Indian market for sneakers is projected to reach 66 million pairs by 2028. Globally, Foot Locker’s 16% sale comes from online which continues to outpace stores at a lower base.
“We are seeing a huge trend towards premiumization of the customer. There's a huge acceleration of the number of customers who are going to be able to afford affluent products. Our average order values have gone up every single year. We see brands entering the country who could not have dreamt of entering the country now doing astoundingly well,” said Adwaita Nayar, CEO, Nykaa.
India is one of the fastest growing and largest international markets for footwear and sportswear brands and over the years saw companies such as Under Armour, Asics and Skechers expand aggressively. Foot Locker has more than 2,800 retail stores in 28 countries across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

"Why Fabindia, Adidas and BoAt are betting big on 10-minute shopping",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/why-fabindia-adidas-and-boat-are-betting-big-on-10-minute-shopping/articleshow/114307989.cms,17-10-2024,"Quick commerce
is becoming a favorite way to shop in India, with more consumers opting for
rapid deliveries
. Big brands such as
Fabindia
, Decathlon, Adidas, U.S. Polo Assn., Hamleys, and BoAt have started offering their products on platforms like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto. According to Astha Gupta, head of apparel and lifestyle at Zepto, the trend is expected to grow, with more brands considering quick commerce as part of their product distribution strategy.
Quick commerce companies are expanding their reach beyond metro cities, tapping into smaller markets like Nashik, Varanasi, Udaipur, Haridwar, and Bathinda. This allows brands to connect with more consumers and offer faster access to their products. Tasva, a menswear brand by
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
, is planning to launch its casual wear collection on these platforms.
Apparel in Quick Commerce Faces Challenges
However, analysts suggest that brands selling apparel might face challenges due to high return rates, as 25-30% of online apparel purchases are returned. Analysts believe that grocery, beauty, personal care, and mobile accessories will remain the top categories for quick commerce due to their lower return rates.
Qcomms' Impact on Retail Chains
The rapid growth of quick commerce has impacted organized retail chains. For example,
Avenue Supermarts
, the parent company of DMart, saw its stock price drop by nearly 9% due to competition from quick commerce platforms in major cities. Quick commerce, initially focused on groceries, has now expanded to non-grocery items such as electronics, home appliances, and even iPhones.

Festive sales hit $6.5 billion in a week on ecommerce street: report
Quick Commerce Market Growth
The quick commerce market in India is valued at $3.34 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to $9.95 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 4.5%. Platforms are now preparing to deliver high-value goods, including refrigerators and washing machines, within 10 to 45 minutes.
Quick commerce platforms have also tapped into festive shopping. Events like Navratri, Ganesh Chaturthi, and Rakhi have led to an increase in sales, with platforms delivering festival-related items quickly.
Brands Eye High-Value Goods
With consumers already purchasing high-priced items like iPhones through quick commerce, the platforms are now focusing on larger appliances such as televisions, laptops, and refrigerators. Companies like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy have expanded their product offerings to include small electronics, and they are now moving into bigger products.
A Deloitte report predicts that the Indian
e-commerce
market will grow at a CAGR of 21% to reach $325 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by an increase in spending by affluent and middle-class households. Affluent consumers are expected to buy larger, premium products, while non-affluent consumers may prefer smaller, unbranded items.

"India's high food prices curtail spending in early festive season, say retailers",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indias-high-food-prices-curtail-spending-in-early-festive-season-say-retailers/articleshow/114286277.cms,16-10-2024,"Rising prices of edible oils and vegetables like onions and tomatoes have driven up
grocery spending
for Indian households ahead of the festival season, prompting some consumers to limit more expensive purchases like electronic items, retailers said.
India's annual festival season, which runs from late September to early November, sees households scramble to buy food and other goods, encouraged by discounts offered by both online and brick-and-mortar retailers.
But the start to the festive season this year has been slow.
Sales of electronics and home appliances so far in October have risen just 5-7% from last year, against estimates for an 8-10% climb, said Nilesh Gupta, director at Vijay Sales, a retail chain with 143 stores.
""We remain optimistic that sales will pick up,"" he said.
Live Events
India's economy is projected to grow by 7.2% in 2024-25, driven by increased
rural demand
, according to the central bank's estimates.
But high-frequency indicators such as auto sales and manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) have suggested weakness in the economy.
Retail inflation
, particularly for food, has remained high, eroding disposable income.
In September, retail inflation was 5.49% and
food inflation
at 9.24%.
Vegetable prices
were 36% higher than a year ago.
""The surge in onion prices, along with other food items, is having a ripple effect on the purchasing behaviour of small customers,"" said B.C. Bhartia, national president of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), representing 2 million retailers.
Sanjay Kumar, 37, an office assistant who earns 22,000 rupees ($262) monthly, said: ""I have cut my vegetable purchases by more than half to stay within my family budget, and I'm postponing the purchase of a microwave for Diwali.""
CAIT had expected festival sales worth 4.25 trillion rupees, 13% higher than last year, driven by rural demand.
A final tally of festival sales will only be available after the Hindu festival of Diwali in November, when purchases hit a peak.
Online sales
, which account for 15% of retail sales during the festive season, are also off to a slow start.
Mobile phones, a key category that sells online, have seen weakness in sales of entry level models, indicating ""continued income stress on low income groups,"" though premium handsets were selling better, said Pushan Sharma, director of research at Crisil Market Intelligence and Analytics.
Bangalore-based consultancy Redseer was more optimistic, estimating online festival sales of 1-1.2 trillion rupees, up 20% on the year, against 13% growth last year.
Major retailers like Reliance Retail, Amazon, and Walmart owned Flipkart are offering discounts and easy credit deals to attract customers.
Fashion, a key sales category during the festive season, saw weak demand in July-September, Dinesh Taluja, senior executive at Reliance Retail, told analysts this week.
""But sales have picked up,"" he said.

"D2C brands see 64% surge in festive orders, outperforming marketplaces: GoKwik",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/d2c-brands-see-64-surge-in-festive-orders-outperforming-marketplaces-gokwik/articleshow/114240503.cms,15-10-2024,"Mumbai: Direct to consumer brands have outpaced marketplaces during the recent sale period, recording a 64% growth in orders from last year, compared to the 26% growth seen on marketplaces, said
Gokwik
.
This shift reflects growing shopper confidence and trust in
D2C brands
making them inert to marketplace sales. Major marketplaces of the Indian
eCommerce
ecosystem ran their biggest festive sales starting from 25 September all the way till Dussehra. Earlier, D2C brands used to witness a dip in orders during this time, but the wheel has shifted since last year.
D2C brands are now also running robust sales parallel to marketplace sales, and continuing to see a surge in order volume.
“D2C is here and thriving, the ecosystem is expanding and the market is deepening,” said GoKwik’s Co-Founder and CEO, Chirag Taneja. “Shoppers are more confident about placing their bets on D2C now more than ever. The personalisation, niche products, and seamless shopping experience brands have been providing to these shoppers is reaping results,” he added.
Footwear, a commonly offline dominant category, emerged as a leader in driving growth and saw a massive 273% increase in orders, followed by fashion & beauty, which saw an 84% and 73% increase in orders respectively. Jewellery too, which is predominantly preferred to be bought online saw a 38% increase in orders. This cements the growing shopper trust in D2C that even offline heavy items are now being bought online.
Live Events
“
Electronics, however, experienced a 3% slowdown, likely impacted by the rise of QuickCommerce, the dominance of marketplaces with high-end discounts on mobile phones, TV etc, and a possible resurgence in offline shopping as offline retailers have also been matching online deals.
Average Order Value (AOV) for D2C brands also saw an 11% jump year on year, from Rs1,368 to Rs1,869. Jewellery, often a category viewed with scepticism in the early days of eCommerce, led this surge, with AOV increasing from Rs1207 in 2023 to Rs1809 this year.
Payment behaviour has also undergone a transformation. GoKwik’s data reveals a 5% increase in prepaid orders, especially in fashion, where shoppers are increasingly opting to pay upfront.
“While UPI continues to be shoppers’ favourite prepaid mode of payment,
EMI
also seems to be the flavour of the season. With GenZ shopping more and more, brands are bridging the gap between aspiration and affordability by providing easy and flexible EMI options.” Taneja said.
Tier 1 contributed the most to this surge in orders, witnessing a 96% spike, an unusual trend during the festive season. Usually, these surge in orders during the festive season were led by Tier 3 cities. Tier 1 cities also saw the highest increase in AOV.
Geographically, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu continued to be the states with the highest surge in order volumes.
GoKwik houses over 10000 brands in its network including
Lenskart
, Neemans, Man Matters,
Shoppers Stop
, etc, ranging from fashion, beauty, health and nutrition, electronics and other key categories of the online shopping space. The eCommerce enabler expects this trend to continue in the next phase of the festive season leading upto Diwali.

Don't worry. Be happy. Demand's back,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/dont-worry-be-happy-demands-back/articleshow/114226003.cms,15-10-2024,"Clothing and lifestyle retailers and shopping malls said there's a pick-up in entry-level demand for clothes and accessories in the past two weeks, after a bad spell of nearly six quarters, lifting the overall sales of discretionary category. And, the trend is not just restricted to top cities.
V-Mart
, a value retailer which operates nearly 470 stores largely in smaller towns, said a conclusive trend will emerge post Diwali although he expects strong demand momentum to continue driven by early winter and weddings. ""Sales have improved compared to last year's festive season and there is surely a pickup in demand which has been sluggish in the past,"" said Lalit Agarwal, chairman of V-Mart.
Sales of discretionary items such as apparel, footwear and beauty started slowing down in 2023 after two years of pandemic-induced runway growth. Retailers saw weak consumer sentiment especially in mass and lower priced products after inflation-stressed consumers curtained spending even as purchases on high-ticket items such as automobiles and electronics continued backed by easy loans.
This was further exacerbated by steep inflation in their daily shopping basket, largely food and essentials such as pulses, oil and vegetables, which saw prices go up by a third and forced lower-income households to slash their discretionary spends.
Live Events
""The good thing is we are seeing some very strong growth in the first or two weeks of October, as the festival season has started kicking in, and we expect this momentum to continue going on to Diwali and for this,"" Dinesh Taluja, chief financial officer,
Reliance Retail
, said during its earnings call.
""The first two weeks of the festive season have been exceptionally good and the aspirational class is leading the growth. With more wedding days, we are expecting a much improved festive season than last year,"" said Ravinder Choudhary, vice president-Vegas & Unity Group, which operates half a dozen malls in Delhi and Punjab.
A recent Centrum report said tapering inflation and growing real wages saw rural recovery driving demand with 15% sales growth for value apparel retail.
""Value retail or bottom of the pyramid consumers have started buying in the last ten days which is a good indication for a strong festive season. However, we are still cautious and are waiting for the trend to develop over a month to call it a real recovery,"" said Devarajan Iyer, chief executive of department store chain Lifestyle International.
However, they are still cautious in placing new orders for fear of inventory pile up like before. In fact, according to a pre-festive season survey by the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India, nearly two-thirds of the respondents expected to see either the same or lower sales of clothing and apparel compared to last year.
""We would rather have a situation of stock-outs than order more and get stuck with piled up inventory. Hence, we are cautious in our inventory management even though we see a strong sales momentum so far,"" said Manish Kapoor, MD, Pepe Jeans.
More than two years ago, apparel and lifestyle retailers increased price-tags across categories after cotton prices surged due to higher shipment cost and rupee depreciation, which started the slowdown trend in the mass-priced category.

On top of that, according to Herrington, Amazon last year managed to cut 45 cents off the cost per unit shipped, a huge savings when considering the massive volume of sales.
- Prime is the 'glue' -
Amazon last year recorded profit of more than $30 billion on revenue of $575 billion, powered by its online retail operation and its AWS cloud computing division.
""They have this whole flywheel model with Amazon Prime membership in the middle,"" said eMarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian.
""That's the glue that keeps everything together.""
Businesses include retail, advertising, cloud computing and streamed movies and music.
But that very model has the 30-year-old company facing a US government lawsuit, accused of expanding an illegal monopoly and otherwise harming competition.
Amazon makes money from data gathered about consumers, either by targeting ads or through insights into what products they might like, Davidkhanian said.
That was why Amazon paid for expensive rights to stream NFL American football games on Prime Video in a move that promises to help it pinpoint fans of the sport.
Amazon's digital assistant Alexa can order items on command and has been even built into appliances such as washing machines to let them automatically buy supplies like laundry soap as needed.
- A 'pocket pharmacy' -
Amazon showed off enhancements to its virtual health care service called
One Medical
.
For $9 a month Prime members are promised anytime access to video consultations with health care professionals, along with record keeping and drug prescriptions.
An Amazon Pharmacy takes advantage of the company's delivery network to get prescriptions to patients quickly, striving for speeds of less than 24 hours for 45 percent of customers by the end of next year.
""We're building a pharmacy in your pocket that offers rapid delivery right to your door,"" Amazon Pharmacy chief Hannah McClellan said, referring to the option of using a smartphone app.
The healthcare market promises to be lucrative for Amazon, which is ""trying to be the platform that has everything for everyone,"" said analyst Davidkhanian.
- Real world wrinkles -
Amazon has suffered setbacks when it comes to brick-and-mortar stores but it continues to strive for a winning strategy.
The company next year will open its first ""automated micro warehouse"" in Pennsylvania, next to a Whole Foods Market organic grocery shop, the chain it bought in 2017.
People will be able to pick up certain items selected online, with orders filled by robots, after shopping next door for fresh produce and groceries.
Meanwhile, Amazon is ramping up use of
artificial intelligence
at its online store with tools helping sellers describe and illustrate products.
Product labels will change according to the user, displaying terms likely to catch their attention such as ""strawberry flavor"" for some and ""gluten-free"" for others.
""The things that Amazon is doing with AI are to make sure that you go from researching something to making the purchase as quickly as possible,"" Davidkhanian said.
At the logistics center near Nashville, robotic arms deftly placed packages in carts that autonomously made their way to trucks.
Logistics center automation improves safety and frees up workers for more interesting tasks, according to Amazon robotics manager Julie Mitchell.
However, critics cite delivery speed pressure and other factors as making Amazon warehouses more dangerous than the industry average.

"Kirana shops are battling for survival amid the rise of q-com, but the story is not over for them yet",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/kirana-shops-are-battling-for-survival-amid-the-rise-of-q-com-but-the-story-is-not-over-for-them-yet/articleshow/114176488.cms,13-10-2024,"A 10-minute war waged from two-wheelers is transforming the urban retail space. As
quick-commerce
companies send out thousands of riders into the lanes and bylanes of metro cities, carrying in their bags everything from onions to iPhones, corner-shop owners are waiting with sacks of wheat and sachets of shampoo for people to walk in. As more and more urban customers gaze at their phone apps and count the minutes—barely 8 to 15— for delivery agents to press the doorbell, the kirana shops in metros are battling for survival. It could become even more acute with the country’s largest retailer, Reliance Retail, entering the quick-commerce space.

How are small traders resisting this onslaught? Can they? The battle ground is still confined to big cities. The shops in small towns and villages remain unscathed.
Mayank Shah, vice-president of Parle Products, one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the country, says, “We don’t see any massive shift in retail dynamics moving away from kirana stores in the foreseeable future. Yes, quick commerce is the new rapidly growing channel, but even as we speak, 85-87% of our annual sales continues to come from neighbourhood grocery stores, and remain crucial to our boardroom strategies.”
India has about 13 million
kirana stores
distributing grocery and daily essentials. They remain the backbone of FMCG companies especially in rural markets and in tier-2 and -3 cities
TALE OF TWO KIRANAS
Prem Kumar, CEO of SnapBizz, a company that provides digital solutions to over 50,000 kirana stores, says, “The network of kirana stores is a national infrastructure that caters to over 90% of our population who shop a few times a week. At stake is not just the survival of these shops but a system that services the masses.”

In metros, it is a different story altogether. Owners of many small and mid-sized kirana shops, whom ET spoke to, say they are staring at extinction.
Deepak Kumar, who owns Ansh Departmental Store in Delhi-NCR, says, “Many grocery shops will wind up in months. Q-commerce sells regular grocery items at discounted prices that we cannot match. Even though we sell goods on credit to our regular customers, they prefer the 10-minute delivery option. It has almost finished our business.”
Vipin Kumar, who runs Gupta General Store in a large housing society in Noida in Delhi-NCR, says, “Kirana stores have been catering to housing colonies for a long time. Online portals will end this tradition altogether. With people getting busy, local offline markets will barely exist in five years or so.” Kumar, who pays Rs 40,000 as monthly rent for the shop space, adds, “Those who own their shops may somehow manage to continue, but shopkeepers like us who have rented space won’t be able to. Rent is going up. We don’t have enough sales to generate profit after paying rent. We will have to exit.”
Fuelling concerns of shopkeepers, Reliance Retail is entering the quick commerce space, hoping its third time will be a charm. Its first two attempts didn’t work out on account of supply and channel glitches and lack of investments.
JioMart
has now launched trial runs in clusters in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Reliance, however, will not be banking on dark stores and will use its existing retail networks, including Reliance Digital and Trends outlets, to service consumers, according to executives aware of the plan.
The quick-commerce juggernaut is rolling ahead.
Redseer Strategy Consultants forecasts that the market size of quick commerce in India could grow by 75-85% to touch $6 billion in FY2025. Metro cities are dominating the surge, contributing 90% of market share in FY2024. Platforms such as Zomato-owned
Blinkit
,
Zepto
,
BigBasket’s BBNow
,
Swiggy
Instamart and Flipkart Minutes have surged on the back of top-dollar investor funding and proliferation of dark stores. This year could see 5 million new monthly transacting users, according to Redseer. Not only are the users growing, but they will also be spending more. The current users will spend 20% more on q-commerce sites this year.
Kumar of SnapBizz acknowledges that quick commerce is impacting kirana stores in metros and large cities. “The younger generation wants to exit family-owned kirana business as they don’t see a future,” he says. In a last-ditch effort, shopkeepers are pivoting, turning their corner shops into dark stores, hyperlocal warehouses of qcommerce companies.
Jairam Hegde, a shopkeeper in Bengaluru’s Koramangala, has turned two of his kirana shops into dark stores for Zepto. It has helped him stay afloat. “There was no other way out. At least I have an income now,” he says, adding an advice to fellow traders. “Don’t wait to adapt to changing times. Transition now unless you have the ability to sustain for the long term.”
For most consumer goods companies, qcommerce forms a third of online sales, which in turn contributes 12-15% of their overall revenues. The change in retail dynamics is affecting inventories in shops. According to retail intelligence firm Bizom, which tracks kirana sales, there has been stock optimisation or reduction of inventories in general trade, which includes kirana stores and large grocery shops, in the past four months compared with last year. The fall was up to 10% in personal care products, 6-7% in homecare and 2-3% in chocolates.
CORPORATE STRATEGIES
Companies are tweaking their distribution strategies.
Dabur
has said it restricted supplies to general trade in September due to the latter’s enhanced inventory levels even as organised channels led by quick commerce reported a “disproportionately higher growth” in the last few quarters. The company, in an earnings update, said high stock levels were impacting the return on investment (ROI) of distributors, which will lead to a single-digit decline in revenue in the September quarter. The company, however, expects revenue growth to normalise in the festive month of October.
Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur, said during the earnings call of Q1 FY2025: “Quick commerce is almost 30-35% of our overall ecommerce and doing exceedingly well.” While Dabur saw a 30% growth in ecommerce, the q-commerce growth was around 70%, driven by Zepto, Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart. Malhotra added, “… we are working with all the major players in quick commerce and devising mixes and portfolio so that our growth is driven along with their growth. It’s a very high-growth channel for us.”
Meanwhile,
Marico
MD Saugata Gupta told investors that its food categories have a potential upside in q-commerce. “Quick commerce as a channel is growing significantly and food as an impulse category is a natural play there. We haven’t played that much in quick commerce in foods, but now we are going to play aggressively,” he said, adding that with q-commerce growth happening mostly in the top eight cities, urban general trade is getting affected.
He said it is imperative “to ensure that we protect the margins and ROI of the distribution system”. Distributors and retail associations are raising their voice against the q-commerce onslaught.
Last month, the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation, a distributors’ body, wrote an open letter to FMCG companies, alleging that “deep discounting by quick commerce ends up hurting the market value of FMCG brands”. It urged FMCG companies “to regulate pricing strategies and protect their brand value”. The association also highlighted that “predatory pricing and deep discounts by quick commerce platforms are harming domestic traders in the country”. The ministries of commerce and industry, and consumer affairs, have stated at various forums that they are measuring “the impact of quick-commerce models on kirana stores”.
Grocer Vipin Kumar of Noida laments, “If we are affected by q-commerce, then others higher in the retail chain like distributors, carrying and forwarding agents, vendors and wholesalers are also getting impacted.” He adds, “However, FMCG companies are still making profits because their products are getting sold via online portals.”
FMCG players say the net channel margins —which companies offer to distributors and retailers—of quick commerce and general trade are almost the same. “The net channel margin for general trade averages about 17%, while that of quick commerce is 15-16%,” says Parle’s Shah.
CAN THEY COEXIST?
Companies insist that both online and offline channels can coexist.
Rohit Jawa, MD of Hindustan Unilever, said at the first-quarter earnings call, that there are overlaps in channels but the intention is to differentiate. “The shopper missions are different now between, say, quick commerce and beauty commerce. General trade, the kirana store, would have a different set of customers. So increasingly, the market is getting segmented, and we have been cautiously designing for channels. In fact, we are now designing for customers.”
This could mean different pack sizes for ecommerce platforms and kiranas.
Kumar of SnapBizz says the story is not over for kiranas: “In many mid-sized and smaller markets, kiranas are thriving. In a lot of these stores, staples such as edible oil, atta and rice are sold loose.” The chief of a large MNC, who declines to come on record because of pre-earnings silent period, says we should stop pitting quick commerce against kiranas: “Why should it be one against the other? This blame game should stop; there is enough room for both to coexist. No FMCG company is prioritising one channel over the other; we are looking at differentiating through a consumer lens, not a channel lens.”

Noel Tata: The Tata who built Trent into a retail powerhouse and a group crown jewel,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/noel-tata-the-tata-who-built-trent-into-a-retail-powerhouse-and-a-group-crown-jewel/articleshow/114157681.cms,12-10-2024,"Mumbai: When
Noel Tata
joined
Trent
in 1999, the then 41-year-old had a clear mandate. Originally incorporated as Lakme Limited way back in 1952,
Tata Group
had decided to divest from its cosmetics business and wanted to focus on apparel retailing, given the absence of established homegrown brands in most categories. It had just acquired the department store Littlewoods International, UK, and changed its name to
Westside
.
After the first department store in south Mumbai's Hughes Road precinct, Noel Tata didn't expand at all during the following six years, trying to perfect the right combination of quality and price through their own private labels unlike other chains such as Shoppers Stop that sold global and local brands.
Since then, he has added nearly 900 stores across formats under Trent, opening about a store every week over the past two decades, and making
Trent
the fourth most valuable company within the Tata Group. The retailer had a market capitalisation of ₹2.94 lakh crore on Friday compared to ₹3,956 crore in 2014. Sales have risen five-fold to ₹12,375 crore in FY24 from ₹2,459 crore in FY14, while net profit has expanded to ₹1,487 crore, compared to ₹19 crore a decade ago.
Playing a pivotal role in the growth of Trent, as its first managing director and then its chairman, he also led acquisitions and global partnerships. Although under him, Trent has had its fair share of hits and misses.

In 2005, Trent acquired a controlling stake in Landmark Bookstores, a Chennai-based privately owned books and music retailer but repositioned it four years ago as a beauty and accessories store format - Misbu. In 2007, Trent entered a franchisee agreement with Benetton Group to set up Sisley stores in India but terminated it to shelve loss-making ventures five years later.
In 2008, Trent launched value fashion stores called Fashion Yatra but shut the format four years later. In 2009, Trent and Inditex established a 49:51 joint venture to run Zara stores in India and two years later, the two companies entered a similar agreement to open Massimo Dutti stores. In 2014, Tesco acquired a 50% stake in Star Bazaar for £85 million and became a joint venture partner. In 2015, Trent entered into a partnership with Sonae to open and operate Sport Zone outlets in India, but the venture was later dissolved.
However, Trent's biggest success was in 2016, when it established a private label menswear chain called
Zudio
in the affordable segment, before expanding its offerings to include womenswear, kids wear and accessories. Zudio, now regarded as a runaway success and among the biggest apparel brands in the country, contributes more than a third to Trent's total revenue compared to just 8% a few years ago. And it has been the fastest-growing format for Trent, surpassing Westside in terms of store count in FY22 and in terms of revenue in FY24.
A recent Citi Research report said over the last five years between FY19 and FY24, Trent has reported the highest revenue CAGR amongst some of the leading listed consumer discretionary and retail companies in India.
""Trent's strategy to 'Build' rather than 'Buy' has been a key driver of creating successful new growth engines. During the initial phase, Trent invested intensively in its supply chain to create a resilient business; revenue growth during FY09-19 was 17% and was predominantly led by Westside from 36 stores in FY09 to 150 stores in FY19 implying 15% store CAGR. However, revenue growth rate during FY19-24 more-than-doubled to 36% CAGR despite Covid-led disruption and a slowdown in discretionary spending led by Trent expanding its brand portfolio through Zudio from 56 stores in FY19 to 545 in FY24 and steady-state growth under Westside 9% store CAGR; 232 stores in FY24,"" the report said.

Online marketplaces see $6.5 billion in sales during festive week,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/online-marketplaces-see-6-5-billion-in-sales-during-festive-week/articleshow/114128695.cms,11-10-2024,"(This story originally appeared in
on Oct 11, 2024)
Online marketplaces
sold goods worth $6.5 billion, or almost `55,000 crore, in one week of
festive sales
, marking a 26% increase from last year, with mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home, and general merchandise accounting for three-fourths of the total sales.
Sales in the week starting September 26 made up for about 55% of the total
ecommerce sales
expected in the festive period this year, ecommerce consultancy Datum Intelligence said.
On September 19, ET had reported that ecommerce players and brands selling online are expected to clock $12 billion in
gross merchandise value
(GMV) this festive season, 23% higher than around $9.7 billion last year.
Demand higher than expected
In ecommerce parlance, GMV is the overall sales clocked on an online marketplace. Industry insiders said online shoppers—including a large chunk from smaller towns and cities—have been buying products with higher average selling price (ASP), with many opting for
EMI payments
. Some brands said they are worried about supply issues because the demand is higher than what they expected.
Ecommerce majors Walmart-owned
Flipkart
and
Amazon India
started their annual festive season sales—Big Billion Days and Great Indian Festival, respectively—on September 27, with early access for subscribers of their loyalty programmes Amazon Prime and Flipkart Plus from September 26.
Live Events
SoftBank-backed Meesho, which started its Meesho Mega Blockbuster Sale on the same day, saw a 40% year-over-year increase in orders. This surge was driven by strong demand from tier-II cities, with nearly 45% of shoppers coming from tier IV and beyond.
“Our first week was much better than the plan, which means the demand was front-loaded, indicating that many people planned their purchases because they wanted to make sure everything arrived well in advance for the festivals,” Meesho cofounder and chief executive Vidit Aatrey told ET. “I think it’s just a very healthy set of demands across the country,” he added.
Flipkart said the company was focusing on faster deliveries across all pin codes while expanding same-day and next-day deliveries. “While major metro cities such as New Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru continue to lead, we are also witnessing strong demand from customers across tier-II+ regions such as Medinipur, Hisar, Berhampore, Bankura, and Agartala to name a few,” a company executive said about its flagship The Big Billion Days programme.
Over the past few years, a trend has emerged where festive sales begin earlier, ahead of Navratri—despite concerns that consumers might hold off buying during ‘Shradh’—a 16-day period (from September 17 to October 2 this year) when many Hindus honour their ancestors and refrain from making purchases. Brands and marketplaces have indicated being consistently surprised by the strong demand during this time.
Around Rs 50,000-55,000 crore ($6-6.5 billion) worth of goods were sold in the first week of ecommerce festive sale, Satish Meena, adviser at Datum Intelligence, said. “The start was very fast... However, in the last day or so, we saw things slowing down,” he said. “It’s typically like this; almost 55-60% spending happens in the first period (and) then the focus moves towards the lower average selling price (ASP) category.”
“There will be one more wave between Dussehra and Diwali,” Meena added.
Micro trends
Gurgaon-based wearables brand Noise, which sells audio devices and smartwatches, pointed out a “noticeable shift” towards products with higher ASPs. “A common trend that we are observing across categories is customers looking at actively upgrading their experiences with a noticeable shift towards higher ASP products,” Gaurav Khatri, cofounder at Noise, told ET.
Ranjit Babu, director, consumer electronics, at Amazon India, said the e-tailer has witnessed strong customer demand across the
consumer electronics
category this festive season, with the premium segment (priced higher than Rs 30,000) seeing the highest year-on-year growth of 30%.

Ecommerce companies are under scrutiny for violating dark pattern norms during sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ecommerce-companies-are-under-scrutiny-for-violating-dark-pattern-norms-during-sales/articleshow/114128636.cms,11-10-2024,"New Delhi: The government is planning a crackdown on
ecommerce companies
after getting several complaints from consumers about
online retailers
flouting norms related to
dark patterns
during the ongoing
festive season sales
.
Dark patterns are
deceptive techniques
used by
online platforms
with the aim of luring users such as sneaking something extra into a consumer's cart during check out, creating a false sense of urgency by saying 'only 1 item left' or forcing consumers to take memberships.
Dark patterns fall under the category of
unfair trade practices
and have been a cause of concern for the government as online retail has been rapidly gaining pace in the country.
""We have received several complaints about companies not following dark patterns which we are examining,"" said a senior official, adding that the Central
Consumer Protection
Authority (CCPA), will act against them.
Live Events
Last December, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, which oversees the CCPA, notified rules to prevent deceptive behaviour of
ecommerce
firms by defining 13 practices, terming them as 'dark patterns', and categorising them as offences under consumer protection laws.
Dark patterns are essentially deceptive user-interface practices crafted by digital commerce firms and online advertisers to manipulate users to make choices or do things that may not otherwise make but benefits the company implementing it.
Dark patterns, most prevalent in advertising, are used to entice consumers into buying a more expensive product, paying more than what was initially disclosed, sharing data or making choices based on false or paid-for reviews.
Categories such as fashion, personal care, ecommerce, food & beverages, and finance are areas facing the most violations.
The festive season is the largest consumption period in the country, contributing up to 35% of annual sales for several consumer-facing companies such as automotive, consumer durable, apparel, beauty, and food and beverage.
With consumers pivoting towards online platforms for the majority of their purchases, all major ecommerce companies run their annual sale events during the festive season, offering huge discounts and assortments to attract buyers.

Quick commerce companies may face action for not giving expiry date,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-companies-may-face-action-for-not-giving-expiry-date/articleshow/114097120.cms,10-10-2024,"New Delhi: The government is planning a crackdown on
quick commerce
companies after receiving multiple
consumer complaints
over not displaying
mandatory disclosures
, such as
expiry date
, about grocery and other daily essentials sold on their platforms, a senior official said.
The
Legal Metrology
(Packaged Commodities) Amendment Rules 2017 mandates mentioning ""best before or use by the date, month and year"" on digital platforms.
If a consumer orders a 5-kg pack of atta and receives a pack that is due for expiry in the next three-four days, he will feel cheated as there is no option to return it, explained the official who did not want to be named.
Leading quick
commerce
companies such as Zomato-owned Blinkit, Zepto and
Swiggy Instamart
do not mention the expiry date, best before date or use by date of grocery and food products, leaving consumers unaware of the duration for which the product can be consumed safely.
Flipkart's newly launched quick-commerce service
Flipkart Minutes
, however, mentions the expiry date of products sold on the platform.

Emails sent to spokespersons of Blinkit, Instamart, Zepto and BBNow did not elicit responses till press time Wednesday.
""We are looking at the complaints we have received through National Consumer Helpline (NCH) and segregating them,"" the official said, adding that no mention of expiry date is a prominent complaint.
The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), which operates under the consumer affairs ministry, is looking into the matter and is expected to take action soon, the person added.
While the best before date indicates the duration for which a product retains its quality, the use by or expiry date tells till when it can be safely consumed.
A senior executive at a leading snack foods maker welcomed the move to strictly implement this rule.

Off the line: Festive season sales see a slow start,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/off-the-line-festive-season-sales-see-a-slow-start/articleshow/114095398.cms,10-10-2024,"Kolkata: Smartphone brands continued to battle a sluggish year, with sales falling by 3% by volume in the first 12 days of the crucial
festive season
sales compared to last year. Tepid demand for entry-level handsets weighed on the overall industry.
Television and household appliance sales grew by 2-3% by volume during the period, led by premium products, as per estimates from leading brands and market researchers. Apparel brands and retailers saw a 6-8% rise in same store sales by value, bringing cheer to the industry.
While e-commerce platforms saw muted demand in the first few days of their biggest annual sales, which began on September 26, it started to recover from Navratri onwards with consumers getting their monthly pay checks, Diwali bonuses and the end of the Shraadh period, which is considered inauspicious for new purchases.
As per market tracker Counterpoint Research,
smartphone sales
volume fell by 3% in the first 12 days of the festive sales this year. By value, sales grew 8% due to a 7% volume growth in premium handsets priced above ₹30,000.
""Sales were modest and not as bullish as the industry had expected. First few days were really slow. Consumers are holding on to their devices in the entry to mid-segment as smartphone life has become better and there are not many 5G model options in the sub-₹10,000 segment,"" said Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint.
Live Events
In consumer electronics, sales volume grew by 2-3% year-on-year while mirroring the growth in smartphone sales by value.
An executive with a leading TV manufacturer said several brands increased discounts by 5-6 percentage points for
online sales
after noting weak sales in the initial days, helping entice new customers.
Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive officer at Super Plastronics, the maker of Kodak, Thomson and Blaupunkt TV brands, said sales were initially weak as online retailers advanced their sales festivals much ahead of Navratri to compete against each other. ""Entry level sales have been a big struggle, but premium grew pushing TV category value growth to 7%,"" he said.
According to Nilesh Gupta, director at Vijay Sales, the electronics retail chain saw 2-3% increase in volume, but value growth was more than 10% with an improvement in the average bill value backed by higher demand for premium products.
Smartphones and electronics are the two largest categories during festive season sales, accounting for 60-65% of total ecommerce sales.
Consumer goods makers are hopeful that demand will recover further by Diwali after muted sales for nearly four quarters. The festive season is the largest consumption period in the country contributing up to 35% of annual sales for several companies.
In apparel, Devaranjan Iyer, CEO at departmental store chain Lifestyle noted robust sales since Navratri with same store sales growing in high single digit and overall growth in double digits. ""Sales are better than last year which has been a big relief,"" he said.
The CEO of a leading apparel maker, who declined to be named, said sales rose in single digit, which he considers decent for an industry struggling for the past few quarters.
After the first period of festive sales till Dussehra, the second wave will begin 7-10 days before Diwali even though ecommerce sites such as Amazon and Flipkart will continue their sales offers.

Modern trade growth at a 4-year low amid online surge; sales at big supermarkets grew only 3.2% during July-Aug,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/modern-trade-growth-at-a-4-year-low-amid-online-surge-sales-at-big-supermarkets-grew-only-3-2-during-july-aug/articleshow/114056825.cms,08-10-2024,"Mumbai: Sales growth of groceries, personal products and home care items in
modern trade
and supermarkets slowed down to a four-year low in July and August, hurt by consumers' shift to online channels, especially
quick commerce
, and retailers shutting down hundreds of stores to improve profitability over the past year.
Sales in modern trade increased 3.2% during July and August, compared to 24% a year ago, according to executives quoting latest available NeilsenIQ data. At the same time, sales at general trade or kiranas expanded 5% in July and August compared to 8.5% in the year-ago period.
Consumer goods
makers estimate that retailers including
Reliance Retail
, More, Spencers and 24Seven have shuttered more than 800 stores over the past year, and while they opened stores at new locations, it will take a few months for sales growth to reflect strongly.
""There has been a churn in modern trade outlets but retailers have also opened newer stores which will take some time to stabilise. Also, there has been an overall slowdown in urban areas with lesser footfall which impacted discretionary products that are largely sold through supermarkets,"" said Krishnarao Buddha, senior category head at Parle Products, India's biggest food company.
Live Events
With a rising proportion of Indian consumer purchases getting unplanned and of low-to-moderate order value, there has been an increase in demand for instant fulfilment, served by Zepto, Swiggy Instamart and Blinkit. For most FMCG companies, online channels are now nearly 10-12% of overall sales and quick commerce platforms account for a third of that. Modern trade accounts for 12-15% of
FMCG sales
.
""Within online, quick commerce has been really disruptive. Compared to a year ago, when ecommerce sales accounted for a fifth of our sales, the channel now contributes nearly a third, on a par with general trade and modern trade. There has been consolidation of modern trade stores as well as they focus more on return on investment and profitability,"" said Aditya Bagri, director at Bagrrys, which sells muesli, oats and cornflakes.
In July,
Avenue Supermarts
, which runs DMart, said it has chosen not to adopt a discounting-heavy approach like some quick commerce players. ""Quick commerce is about convenience and not discount-they are giving excellent convenience. So, some top-end or affluent consumers who shop from
DMart
might fall off,"" CEO Neville Noronha told investors. ""There could be a 1-2% impact from quick commerce in metros but we cannot pinpoint exactly.""
As per a study by NielsenIQ, 31% of shoppers are using quick commerce for buying main needs, and 39% for top-up purchases. About 42% of shoppers are using quick commerce for buying ready-to-eat meals and 45% for salty snacks.
Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa wrote in a shareholder letter in August that there is a share shift from mid-premium range modern retail in large cities. ""The kind of selection and the customers we target have caused some amount of share shift from mid-size and large sized organised retail within large cities. These are outlets that were able to attract audiences with larger assortment and wide choice of brands, with a significant salience of daily use premium items. We have been able to offer equivalent or better experience to customers, with added convenience of quick home delivery,"" he said.

"Reliance Retail targets quick commerce market, challenging Blinkit, Swiggy's Instamart",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-targets-quick-commerce-market-challenging-blinkit-swiggys-instamart/articleshow/114022274.cms,07-10-2024,"Reliance Retail
has initiated efforts to enter the thriving
quick commerce
market in a move that is set to escalate competition for Zomato-owned
Blinkit
, Swiggy Instamart and BigBasket, among others. The country's largest retailer has started offering quick commerce services in select areas in Navi Mumbai and Bengaluru through its ecommerce platform
JioMart
since last weekend.
It will initially sell grocery items from its retail stores totalling about 3,000 nationwide, eventually adding value fashion and small electronic products such as smartphones, laptops and speakers, a senior executive said. All orders will be fulfilled from its own network of stores including Reliance Digital and Trends.
The retail arm of Reliance Industries plans to rapidly scale up its quick commerce venture pan-India by this month-end with the aim to deliver most orders in 10-15 minutes and the rest within 30 minutes, the executive said. The company will use its acquired logistics service Grab for the fulfilment.
Reliance, however, doesn't have any plan to set up dark stores or neighbourhood warehouses, unlike other quick commerce operators, the executive said. Analysts said this may become a challenge in delivering orders within 30 minutes in large cities where traffic is high during peak hours.

To entice customers, Reliance won't charge any delivery fee, platform fee or surge fee irrespective of the order value, and keep a major focus on untapped smaller cities and towns where quick commerce operators like Blinkit are yet to enter, the executive said. Other platforms have a
delivery fee
and platform fee.
Reliance plans to offer a wider choice of products of 10,000-12,000 stock keeping units by linking its entire store inventory to the quick commerce business, which too is much more than rivals.
Eventually, the company aims to cover 1,150 cities spanning 5,000 pin codes where it runs grocery stores. The executive said the company would target a bigger share of business from towns and smaller cities hitherto untapped by quick commerce firms.
""Reliance has reworked the way orders are delivered for JioMart. Earlier, orders had a scheduled delivery taking 1-2 days by small trucks who would take multiple orders and deliver them one by one. Now, all grocery orders will be quick commerce where one delivery bike or cycle will deliver one order. Each grocery store will cover a 3 KM radius,"" the executive said.
Earlier this year, the company tried to reduce JioMart delivery timings to a few hours or at least the same day under its hyperlocal initiative. It has fine-tuned the process further to 10-30 minute delivery. ""This has become a top-of-the-kind requirement in the market right now,"" the executive said.
A spokesperson for Reliance Retail didn't respond to ET's queries.
Devangshu Dutta, chief executive at consulting firm Third Eyesight, said Reliance can ultimately use a blended approach of quick commerce deliveries in areas near its stores and scheduled deliveries a bit far away.
""Since they are in a market share acquisition mode in quick commerce, charging no transaction fees and offering higher discounts on products is a given. There is significant scope for deep-pocketed players like Reliance to strengthen presence in quick commerce. They have aggressively backed other experiments in the retail business once they worked, and may do it again,"" said Dutta.
For fast-moving consumer goods companies, quick commerce is the fastest growing channel, accounting for 30-35% of total online sales.

"Value retail, jewellery and luggage to outperform footwear and QSR in July-September quarter",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/value-retail-jewellery-and-luggage-to-outperform-footwear-and-qsr-in-july-september-quarter/articleshow/114015714.cms,07-10-2024,"The July-September quarter performance is expected to be a mixed bag for retail with
value retail
,
jewellery
and
luggage
outperforming
footwear
and
QSR
which is seeing continued demand challenges given heavy rainfall.
""Tapering inflation saw rural recovery driving demand with 15% sales growth for value apparel retail. Growth in jewellery supported by custom duty cut which was partially offset by lower wedding days in the second quarter,"" said a report by Centrum adding that its checks showed higher online sales to support 15 volume growth for the luggage industry. The QSR sector continues to remain softer due to aggressive store expansion, weaker out-of-home consumption, and elevated competition from platforms.
Footwear is expected to deliver low to mid-single digit volume growth due to restricted travel and wedding days along with slowdown in discretionary spends.
However, payers remain optimistic of the long-term demand prospects of the Indian retail industry, given the low level of penetration of the organised segment. Despite pressure on the profit margins, retailers have been spending aggressively on
network expansion
.
Capital expenditure
outlay for ICRA’s sample set of companies towards store additions is expected to increase by 20% to Rs.2,200-2,300 crore in FY2025. Most of these stores will be set up in tier-III and tier-IV cities.
""Considering that nearly 70% of India’s population resides in tier-III and tier-IV cities, it's evident that these markets hold tremendous potential. The arrival of larger players here is not a threat but rather a validation of the untapped opportunities,"" said Shivani Soni, co-founder, Udaipur-based clothing brand
Beyoung
which entered into physical retailing with its first store earlier this year, part of its plan to open 300 outlets within the next three years.

Founded in 2018 from Udaipur, located in Rajasthan, Beyoung has a current GMV of Rs200 crore and it has a target to achieve Rs650 crore GMV in the next three years.
""While big brands will focus on their pricing and supply chain strengths, smaller businesses have the upper hand in understanding local and regional preferences, building authentic connections, and offering personalized experiences. It’s about recognizing that there's ample room to thrive and using this momentum to create a lasting impact in these vibrant markets,"" added Soni.
ICRA expects 14-15% YoY revenue growth for the year, supported by network expansion. The
fashion retail
segment has been struggling with a demand slowdown since Q4 FY2023 due to inflationary headwinds. The fashion retailers in ICRA’s sample set reported a YoY sales growth of 18% in the first quarter FY25, led by expansion in store network and introduction of new product categories.

market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $ 325 billion in 2030, as per
Deloitte
’s report released on Monday.
The report said that the
retail sector
is expected to grow at 8%, e-commerce at 21%, and fast-moving
consumer goods
(
FMCG
) at 10%. All the sub-sectors will see a growth of 10% plus and minus than their sectors.
The reason for this growth is the income increase in affluent and middle-class households, whose contribution together is expected to increase from 32% to 48%. Affluent households generally opt for bigger pack sizes and a preference for
premium goods
which indicates a boost in spending capacity. However, non affluent consumers are choosing smaller and unbranded or more affordable products.
Talking at an event organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) where this report was unveiled, union minister of food processing industries Chirag Paswan said
India
as a market not just gives huge opportunity domestically but also to the world. ""Our population gives us diversity in every sector through new technologies and innovation,” he said.
The resilience and adaptability of the FMCG sector is key to shaping a strong and sustainable economy, Paswan added. He said that India should not compromise on the standard of products and ensure its quality.
Live Events
Deloitte said while the consumer industry is driving the country’s economic resilience, a strategic partnership between the government and private sector is crucial to maintain this. Policies and reforms for inflation control, credit access,
ease of doing business
, incentivizing R&D, promoting health, and enhancing rural infrastructure are significant, it said.
Quick commerce
with faster deliveries is expected to grow significantly in non-metro cities. While Quick commerce becomes the preferred medium for immediate needs and impulse purchases, e-commerce is favoured for more planned purchases like home, beauty and personal care.
“Online is about 10% of FMCG sales. Within that, quick commerce holds 35% of the share of all FMCG online sales. So, quick commerce will impact e-commerce chains and modern trade. There will be some cannibalisation within the modern formats itself. Considering the convenience that quick commerce provides and its entry into other categories like mobile phones, it will eat into the revenue of the larger players and that’s why they are also getting into quick commerce. Some e-commerce marketplaces have already done it. Others will also get into it,” Anand Ramanathan, partner of consumer products and retail sector leader at Deloitte India told ET.
India’s FMCG, e-commerce, and retail sectors depend on strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&As) to focus on long-term growth and competitiveness. Nearly 60% of these M&As happen in related areas while 30% try to diversify through these deals, the report said.
“Across these consumer sectors, we observe common threads of driving premiumization, accelerating new product development and the adoption of digital at scale,” Ramanathan said during the unveiling of the report.
About 78% of the consumers are now willing to pay some premium on healthy food and beverages. An increasing trend of avoiding ultra-processed foods is observed. Consumers are also ready to pay extra for sustainable products, eco-friendly and minimal packaging, clean labels, ethically sourced products, and brands that engage in ethical labour practices. The market of clean-label ingredients reported a 20.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2022. Indian retailers are also launching more and more private labels priced 25-40% lower than other brands for price-sensitive consumers.
“Notably, the number of registered complaints has doubled since last year, indicating growing consumer confidence in national grievance redressal mechanism,” said Nidhi Khare, secretary of the department of consumer affairs from the ministry of consumer affairs, food, and public distribution.

""We are incredibly happy to introduce Augustinus Bader, our scientifically backed skincare line that redefines luxury and efficacy to India. Tira, with its understanding of Indian
beauty market
, was a perfect choice for our foray into India. I believe, this exclusive partnership with Tira marks a significant milestone for us, as we expand our footprint into one of the world's most dynamic beauty markets,"" said Charles Rosier, Co-Founder and CEO of Augustinus Bader.
India’s beauty market will grow to $20 billion by 2025, with the premium luxury segment scaling up by 15%. From clean beauty to inclusive skincare and AI cosmetics solutions, luxury beauty retailers, together with online retail platforms, are working to enhance customer experience, according to Euromonitor estimates.
Data by Research and Markets shows that the skin care products market in India was worth $6.53 billion in 2022 and would reach $8.84 billion by 2027 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.25%.
In a market that is seeing a boom, Tira competes with Nykaa, Tata Cliq Palette, Myntra and others in the market for beauty products. Apart from online, Tira has also opened a dozen offline stores in top cities.

Tata Group forays into mass-priced beauty segment with Zudio Beauty,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tata-group-forays-into-mass-priced-beauty-segment-with-zudio-beauty/articleshow/113991974.cms,06-10-2024,"Mumbai: Noel Tata-led
Trent
has added a standalone format, called
Zudio Beauty
, to its line of stores which will compete with the likes of
Hindustan Unilever
's Elle18, Sugar Cosmetics, Health & Glow and Colorbar in the country's mass-priced
beauty segment
.
""The new concept store is part of its strategy to tap into the affordable beauty space as most of the rivals from
Reliance
,
Nykaa
and
Shoppers Stop
are focussing on premium and luxury categories,"" said two executives aware of the development. ""The first store has opened in Bengaluru and
Trent
is planning to add more outlets in top cities, including Gurugram, Pune and Hyderabad.""
Tata, which founded India's first beauty brand Lakme-which was later sold to HUL-is already into the beauty segment with a high-end cosmetics store format - Tata Cliq Palette.
Zudio has been a runaway success for the company and now among the biggest apparel brands in the country. Since its inception in FY17 within Star stores, Zudio has seen considerable expansion, and its success has been aided by an exclusive design portfolio and a low gross margin of 35-40%. This enables the company to achieve high store productivity, with a revenue per sq ft of ₹16,300, which is twice the industry average.
Live Events
Carved out as a separate format from Star Bazaar in FY18, the Zudio format now accounts for more than a third of Trent's total revenue, compared with 8% a few years ago. And it has been the fastest growing format for Trent, surpassing Westside in terms of store count in FY22 and in terms of revenue in FY24. As of June this year, the company had 228 Westside stores, 559 Zudio stores and 36 stores across other lifestyle concepts.
Despite multiple retailers operating in the value retailing segment for more than a decade, Zudio surpassed most of the existing players in terms of revenue as well as stores. Analysts expect a similar trend in beauty too.
""This is another disruptive move by Trent after being so successful in value apparel. And this could be the next potential success if their quality is liked by consumers,"" said Abneesh Roy, executive director, Nuvama. ""Other competitions in this space are largely similar to Nykaa and it is potentially negative for them and other fast moving consumer goods players.""
This year, L'Oreal SA and Shiseido, two of the world's largest cosmetics companies, said India is fast becoming one of their key growth drivers, helped by a burgeoning population and people's affinity towards beauty products.
L'Oreal said India is already its fifth largest market in the professional products division which mainly sells products to salons. Last year, Shoppers Stop partnered with Japanese firm Shiseido to bring its premium beauty brand Nars Cosmetics to India.
At present, focussed beauty brands, including L'Oreal, Mama Earth, Nivea and Nykaa, have a 33% share and are expected to expand to 42% in the next five years, while established firms such as HUL, Procter & Gamble that now account for two-thirds of the market, will see their shares fall 900 basis points to 58% by 2027, according to a joint report by Redseer Strategy Consultants and Peak XV.
""Prima facie, it may appear that Zudio's current store count of over 550 implies that incrementally the store addition may slow down and reaching 2,000 stores might be difficult. However, our analysis suggests the headroom to grow Zudio is much higher,"" said a report by Citi Research.

According to a report by Datum Intelligence, e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart together recorded sales of over Rs 54,500 crore from September 26 to October 2, marking a 26% year-on-year increase. Nearly 60% of the spending was fueled by mobile phones (38%), followed by electronics and consumer durables (21%).
""iPhone 15 and previous generations dominated sales... Samsung's Galaxy S23 FE also did exceptionally well on Flipkart,"" Analyst Shubham Singh from Counterpoint Research told ToI.
Higher-end mobile phones, especially those priced above Rs 30,000, were popular due to significant discounts. The launch of new iPhone models also led to price drops on older versions, boosting sales.

"Karnataka HC grants interim stay on CCI proceedings against Flipkart, Amazon",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/karnataka-hc-grants-interim-stay-on-cci-proceedings-against-flipkart-amazon/articleshow/113949211.cms,05-10-2024,"The
Karnataka High Court
has imposed an interim stay on the competition watchdog’s proceedings against
Flipkart
and
Amazon
due to a
procedural lapse
on the part of the director general (DG) investigating alleged
foreign direct investment
(FDI) rule violations by the two
ecommerce companies
.
The initial report, submitted by the DG on August 9, concluded that Amazon and Flipkart, in collusion with certain sellers on the platforms and mobile phone brands, indulged in
anti-competitive practices
such as exclusive launches, deep discounting and preferential listings, which are in violation of the Competition Act.
But the court found that the DG of the
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) had flouted the watchdog’s rules. The entities named by the DG as preferred sellers on the platforms were renamed “opposite parties” after initially enlisting them as “third parties,” without seeking CCI’s nod.
“The petitioners argue that this action by the DG is in violation of the established procedures and regulations, as the DG is required to obtain prior approval from the commission before altering the status of a party from a third party to an opposite party in the course of an investigation,” justice Hemant Chandangoudar said in an order, setting October 21 as the next date of hearing.
Ratification required
“This procedural lapse calls for rectification and the report submitted by the director general should be considered void to the extent it has contravened the statutory provisions and the commission’s regulatory framework.”

ET has reviewed a copy of the interim order passed by the court on September 27. In its initial findings, the CCI had said that Flipkart and Amazon’s business models are designed to grab market share by selling products through preferred partners at lower costs, often at losses, thereby flouting India’s FDI rules.
The CCI, in separate but similar reports, had said Amazon and Flipkart were aware of evolving FDI rules under which they were not allowed to sell inventory directly to customers. But they flouted them by establishing a string of preferred sellers, either newly created or through existing enterprises with no significant business.
“Since its business model was to incur losses for some years and FDI is needed for loss funding, and since FDI is not allowed in inventory model, it has decided to sell its inventory through some enterprises either created newly or onboard existing enterprises with no significant business,” the CCI observed, after investigating alleged anti-competitive practices of Amazon and Flipkart. ET has reviewed copies of the two reports that have been sent to the companies — with redacted sections — but have not been made public.
Amazon declined to comment while Flipkart, owned by US retail giant Walmart, didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries. The companies have previously denied any wrongdoing.
Unredacted versions
Industry executives aware of the development said Amazon and Flipkart plan to ask for unredacted versions of the reports in order to contest them. Their options include questioning the report conclusions, the witnesses and third parties, as well as the DG who conducted the investigation.
However, after the court’s interim stay, the case has now effectively come to a standstill with no avenue for the ecommerce companies to seek unredacted versions, they said.
In its initial findings, the CCI said that the preferred entities were made to procure inventory from the platforms’ respective wholesale units or from other entities chosen by the platforms under terms and conditions imposed by them.
“The inventory so procured was disposed of on the same platform to the customers. The platforms had end-to-end control over the inventory and the seller is for only namesake,” the CCI said.
It added that the sellers were just name-lending enterprises since the platforms could not put their brands on the invoices if they wanted to avail of FDI.
“Selling at losses would obviously bring losses to the enterprise and the same can only be met with external money. Amazon having parent enterprises located outside India can support such a loss by pumping FDI,” the regulator said, identifying six enterprises as preferred sellers on Amazon.
Preferred sellers
In an identical report against Flipkart, CCI said the ecommerce platform had 33 such preferred sellers, which were further divided into alpha and beta sellers. This was created after FDI rules were amended in 2018 to impose a 25% restriction in procurement of inventory by any seller from the platform’s group entity.
The CCI also examined periodical FDI data published by the government to find that a total of Rs 36,711 crore was received by Flipkart and its 11 group companies between FY16 and FY22. The figure stands at Rs 46,876 crore if data till the end of 2022 is considered, with 96.6% of FDI having come into three companies under Flipkart — Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd (the entity that runs the platform), Flipkart India Pvt Ltd (the wholesale unit) and Instakart Services Pvt Ltd (the warehousing and logistics arm).
Amazon and its 13 group companies in India, CCI said, received Rs 54,138 crore between FY16 and FY22. The figure stands at Rs 63,555 crore if data till the end of 2022 is considered, of which 63% of FDI has come into two companies under Amazon — Amazon Seller Services Pvt Ltd (which runs the platform) and Amazon Wholesale India Pvt Ltd (the wholesale arm).
The CCI started the investigation around four years ago after a group of brick-and-mortar mobile phone sellers alleged the two platforms were indulging in anti-competitive practices through exclusive launches of mobile phones, and deep discounting in collusion with leading smartphone brands.
They also alleged that the platforms had a set of sellers that would get preferential listings on the marketplace.
“Each of the anti-competitive practices alleged against Amazon… were investigated and found to be true and in contravention of Section 3(4), read with Section 3(1) of competition act,” CCI said in its report against Amazon. Identical clauses have been included in the Flipkart report as well.
“These practices have created an ecosystem on the platform… wherein no seller other than its preferred seller can survive. Ordinary sellers remained as mere database entries on Amazon as the preferred sellers through understanding/agreements of exclusive launch deny the opportunity to non-preferred sellers to compete,” CCI said.

There will be no change in policy on multi-brand retailing: Piyush Goyal in US,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/there-will-be-no-change-in-policy-on-multi-brand-retailing-piyush-goyal-in-us/articleshow/113922772.cms,04-10-2024,"Washington: Union Minister of Commerce and Industry
Piyush Goyal
on Thursday categorically ruled out the entry of multi-brand retailing in India as such a move would destroy pop-and-mom stores like that of the US. Except for this, he said, India is open to all kinds of economic reforms necessary to take the country on an accelerated growth. ""If the need arises, we can re-look at any of these (policies) or the government has the authority through cabinet approval to allow greater percentages (of foreign stakes in various sectors). Or we can go to Parliament and change it also, not a problem, though I do not think any of these requires parliamentary changes,"" Goyal said in response to a question at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies think-tank here.
""The important area where sometimes, and particularly in countries like the US, I hear voices is about
multi-brand retail
. And that is a no-no. I want to make it loud and clear that there will be no change in our policy on multi-brand retail. America has suffered the consequences of big tech and large retail and the interplay of the two leading to almost the annihilation of mom-and-pop stores across the length and breadth of the country,"" he said.
Goyal said the United States can afford it because its population is much smaller compared to India and there are alternative avenues for people to do jobs in.
""And probably, you are satisfied that the rest of the youngsters are now just left to be sales delivery boys or delivery girls. That is a choice each country makes,"" he noted.
""India has nearly 100 billion small mom-and-pop stores in the length and breadth of the country. In every village that you will go to, there will be 10 or 12 small shops selling different types of products. There will be 10 or 12 small shops providing different services. There will be a pharmacy in almost every corner around the country,"" the minister said.

""We believe that they all play a very important role. We want them to be integrated with technology. We are happy if they get integrated with e-commerce or get a chance to withstand the business practices of the e-commerce companies. But we are not looking at changing the rules for e-commerce. Other than that, there is no sector left where we have any restrictions whatsoever,"" he said.
The senior leader from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (
BJP
) said even in defence, 100 per cent foreign ownership is allowed in India.
""Space has been opened up to foreign ownership. It is a very open country. Money can move in and out pretty much easily with no stoppages, but there could be a process required just to make sure there is no
money laundering
or there is no round-tripping of money going out of India and coming back into the country as a tax arbitrage. A few safeguards are there,"" he said, adding that today, nobody is telling him that they are not investing in India due to any of the government policies.

Traffic jam in Kirana route as q-comm industry goes jamming,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/traffic-jam-in-kirana-route-as-q-comm-industry-goes-jamming/articleshow/113884228.cms,02-10-2024,"Kolkata | Mumbai: India's thriving
quick commerce
industry is pushing fast-moving consumer goods companies to curtail sales to distributors in large cities and address an inventory glut at kiranas or small neighbourhood retail stores.
Dabur
has restricted supplies to the general trade in September due to enhanced inventory levels after organised channels led by quick commerce reported ""disproportionately higher growth"" in the last few quarters. The company, in an earnings update on Tuesday, said high stock levels were impacting distributor ROI (return on investment) which will lead to a mid-single digit decline in
revenue
in the September quarter. It, however, expects revenue growth to normalise this month.
Stock Optimisation
Retail intelligence firm Bizom, which tracks kirana sales, said there has been a 2-3% stock optimisation in chocolates, up to 10% in personal care products, and 6-7% in homecare at general trade over the past four months on an average compared to last year.
For the country's largest packaged edible oil company
Adani Wilmar
, nearly half of its sales are now from organised trade led by quick commerce in large
markets
like the National Capital Region, Bengaluru and Pune as compared to 25-30% a year ago, said managing director Angshu Mallick. This has led to
inventory optimisation
since the company ensures weekly billing and replenishment of all outlets to keep the stock fresh. Organised trade would include grocery retail chains and ecommerce as well.

Tarun Arora, chief executive of
Zydus Wellness
, the maker of Complan health drink and Glucon-D energy drink powder, said
demand
moving to quick commerce is an industrywide phenomenon, and sales to distributors are billed as per sales.
Preventing Over-stocking
""While we are seeing some pressure on small retailers, and in turn, on urban distributors impacted by reduced growth in general trade due to quick commerce, the former remains key to
FMCG
business. The need to improve efficiencies of the distribution can even include distributor consolidation, although it's not an easy task,"" said Arora. Over the past year, several companies have reduced margins for general trade distributors.
Vishesh Dora, chief of staff at Bizom, said brands have already taken stock optimisation measures for general trade channels. ""Preventing over-stocking through tech interventions along with driving specific SKUs to general and modern trade. Personal care and homecare as a category can be seen with further optimised stock in GT stockists. Brands are already evolving to accommodate both physical and digital channels,"" he said.
To be sure, quick commerce firms like Zepto, Swiggy Instamart and Zomato-owned Blinkit have maintained they are growing at the cost of modern trade and ecommerce. Blinkit chief executive Albinder Dhindsa wrote in a shareholder letter in August that it is not taking share away from kiranas or from value-focused large retail chains like DMart.
""The value focused items available in these formats are hard to replicate in our business; especially in categories like staples, where price sensitivity is higher, and we don't have the ability to sell open SKUs that brick and mortar can. Most kiranas also offer personalised commerce, e.g. the khata system for their customers, while we sadly, aren't able to,"" he had said.
Fastest Growing Channel
However, companies say they are seeing consumers shift from kiranas to quick commerce. As a result, quick commerce has become the fastest growing channel for the last 6-8 quarters. For instance, for biscuit maker Parle Products, quick commerce growth rate is 35-40% as compared to 18-20% in ecommerce, 12-15% in modern trade, and 5-6% in general trade.
As per a recent study by FMCG sales researcher NielsenIQ, 31% of shoppers are using quick commerce for buying main needs, and 39% for top-up purchases. As much as 42% of shoppers are using quick commerce for buying ready-to-eat meals and 45% for salty snacks.

"Premiumisation, pent-up demand to lead festive demand: Redseer",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/premiumisation-pent-up-demand-to-lead-festive-demand-redseer/articleshow/113857876.cms,02-10-2024,"Premiumisation
and
pent-up demand
will lead
festive demand
in 2024, a new report by consulting and analytics firm
Redseer Strategy Consultants
said. The report based its findings on brands looking to push premium packs at discounted prices to encourage aspirational buying and pent-up demand in categories such as mobiles, electronics and fashion.
The report noted that growth of e-commerce would increase by 20% year-on-year and reach Rs 100,000-120,000 crore in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) in the 2024 season.
New assortments are being launched around the festive period in categories such as fashion, with festive upside in segments such as beauty and personal care and q-commerce, according to the report.
“Mobiles and electronics remain key value growth drivers this festive season, specially as consumers respond to affordability options that make premium products more accessible. Besides, seller platforms have potential to unlock pent-up demand in the category by optimising pricing and selection,” Kushal Bhatnagar, associate partner, Redseer Strategy Consultants, said.
Quick commerce, which saw significant traction in 2023, is set to contribute approximately 8% to overall
e-commerce growth
in festive 2024, up from 5% last year. Initially focused on grocery deliveries, quick commerce has now expanded into beauty and small electronics, driven by consumers’ increasing demand for fast, on-demand delivery, according to the report.
Live Events
Newer categories such as home and kitchen appliances are likely to get pushed aggressively on q-commerce platforms and could also help the platforms to boost their average order value and profitability, Bhatnagar said.
Brands are implementing multi-channel strategies to boost sales, with premium products being showcased through offline modern trade outlets and direct-to-consumer channels to maintain exclusivity. At the same time, mid-range products are being promoted across e-commerce marketplaces to maximise reach and appeal to an aspirational customer base, the report added.

Will iPhone 16 become a new milestone for India's quick commerce?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/will-iphone-16-become-a-new-milestone-for-indias-quick-commerce/articleshow/113870878.cms,02-10-2024,"Apple iPhone season officially rolled out last month, and Indians have not stopped ordering since then.
iPhone 16
is being delivered at the doorstep in just 10 minutes — by popular
quick commerce
platforms. Starting from Rs 79,900, the latest Apple product was available to order on Bigbasket and Blinkit just like the atta-dal these platforms routinely deliver. Both the quick commerce platforms sold hundreds of iPhones in the first few hours.
Many see quick commerce delivery apps coming of age with doorstep deliveries of iPhone 16. Though they are popular for delivering groceries, FMCG goods and small electronics, it was for the first time they were delivering such a high-value good.
The quick commerce market in India is currently valued at $3.34 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $9.95 billion by 2029, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 4.5 per cent over the forecast period.
Riding on solid numbers and people's trust, the likes of Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, Zomato’s Blinkit and BigBasket’s BBNow are now eyeing the bigger game i.e. high-value goods and white goods. As per industry executives, many quick commerce companies have been planning to venture out in high-value goods by Diwali, delivering refrigerators and washing machines within 10 to 45 minutes. Brands are open to partnerships with these platforms, encouraged by the success of the model in FMCG, industry executives have told ET.
If quick commerce companies can deliver some thing of as much value as the iPhone, then why not other high-value goods? iPhone16 deliveries, though limited in scale, might prove a milestone for these companies who are eyeing the next stage of growth where they will be directly competing with e-commerce companies for high-ticket purchases.

Swiggy's street fight with Zomato is the one to watch out for in q-comm arena
Big plans for big items
Quick commerce companies are now gunning for a higher share of the consumer wallet by evolving from small-ticket purchases to televisions, laptops, refrigerators and washing machines. So far, BlinkIt, Zepto, BigBasket and Swiggy sell small daily-use electronics such as earbuds, smartwatches, fans, Bluetooth speakers, lighting products, mixer-grinders, clothes irons, hair trimmers, computer peripherals and streaming devices. “Consumers would earlier only buy low-priced items via quick commerce, but the ticket size has now gone up,” Thomson TV chief executive Avneet Singh had told ET a few months ago. Echoing this sentiment, Sameer Mehta, chief executive at Imagine Marketing India, which owns the Boat brand, said, “Consumers are already buying gaming consoles through quick commerce. It’s become a way of shopping in large cities. In fact, they don’t even want much discount, but instant gratification and convenience.”
Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart have already delivered air coolers that are priced upwards of Rs 5,000 in addition to many other high-value products. BigBasket chief executive Hari Menon told ET in June that it will deliver most electronics products within 15 minutes, and large appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and washing machines within 30-45 minutes.
However, most quick commerce companies’ plans to scale up rapidly into high-value electronic products by this festive season are still half-baked as the partnerships are being negotiated, industry executives have told ET.

The quick commerce steamroller is pushing e-commerce players with big pockets to jump right into the ongoing dash-for-deliveries dog fight and every advantage is welcomed. Amazon is likely to launch its Q-commerce in India, in the first quarter of next year to compete with its rival, Flipkart, which launched Flipkart Minutes in Bengaluru last month. It is being rolled out in New Delhi and Mumbai and would offer a wider range of products such as laptops and smartphones, courtesy its existing logistical infrastructure and product listings.
Speed breakers ahead?
Typically, The 10-30 minute delivery platforms record an average order value (AOV) of around Rs 500-600, E6 reported last month. Now, as they look to deliver higher-value products, new challenges might emerge. “The whole supply chain follows a certain cost structure but with newer, more expensive goods, it will require an overhaul on account of real estate, logistics and even working capital costs going up in certain categories,” a senior Gurgaon-based executive at a quick commerce firm had told ET.
A senior company executive had told ET that movement of vehicles and turnaround time will come under stress when companies have to deliver bigger goods than groceries and staples. “The moment you shift from two-wheelers to a three-four-wheeler, costs increase,” the person added. The founder of a D2C brand in the fashion space, who is in discussions with Blinkit and Zepto to list products, had told ET that quick commerce logistics has not yet evolved to handle returns or exchanges.
Also, quick commerce businesses are unlikely to offer as vast a range of electronic products on their platforms as a Flipkart or an Amazon, as per industry executives.

In addition to this, it will take some time for Indians to warm up to the idea of buying white goods from these apps. iPhone is a well-known brand that people don’t need to physically inspect because they already understand what it offers. However, when it comes to white goods like refrigerators, many consumers still prefer to check them out in showrooms.

e-commerce
companies
Flipkart
and
Amazon
as they are engaging in
predatory pricing
and are burning cash to offer heavy discounts on products, traders' body CAIT and mainline mobile retailers' association AIMRA said on Tuesday. These practices, in turn, are creating a
grey market
of mobile phones, causing losses to the exchequer ""as players in the grey market evade taxes"", they said.
Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), in collaboration with the All India Mobile Retailers' Association (AIMRA), placed the demands in a white paper on the impact of e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart on India's retail ecosystem.
AIMRA demanded suspension of operations of Chinese mobile phone companies OnePlus, iQOO, and Poco for allegedly colluding with e-commerce players.
The white paper alleged violations of foreign direct investment (FDI) policy and other regulatory frameworks by Flipkart and Amazon.
""They (Flipkart and Amazon) deeply indulge in predatory pricing,
deep discounting
, loss funding, etc. Whatever investment they are bringing that is being used to burn cash, to fund losses they accrue during their operations in India,"" BJP MP and CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal, said.

Speaking at a summit organised by AIMRA, Khandelwal said, ""It looks that there is a cartel between e-commerce players, the brands, and the banks. They are hand-in-gloves to capture the market by various means but mainline retailers will not allow this to happen. We are not against e-commerce but we want a level-playing field and fair means of doing business.""
At the summit, there was a unanimous demand that the ""CCI should immediately suspend operations of Amazon and Flipkart and the allied companies which are helping both these companies to captivate the market"".
When contacted, OnePlus declined to comment on the matter, while Flipkart, Amazon, Poco, and iQOO did not share any immediate reply.
AIMRA Founder and Chairman Kailash Lakhyani said some of the brands and banks are colluding with e-commerce companies for deep discounting.
""Customers are not being able to buy mobile phones that come at heavily discounted price, as these are purchased by the grey market. These (grey market purchases) can easily be tracked with the help of IMEI... It is also a loss for the government as grey market players evade taxes,"" he said.
Operations of Chinese brands such as OnePlus, Poco, and iQOO should be suspended for at least 1-2 years as they are engaging in trading activities without any value addition to the Indian economy, Lakhyani added.

But alongside, Swiggy's plan to hit the Street also signals a new chapter for the Bengaluru-based startup as it eyes dominance in India's rapidly expanding
quick commerce
market.
The company is raising funds not just to boost its food delivery business but majorly to fuel the growth of its quick commerce arm,
Instamart
. With
Zomato
well placed in the game through its acquisition of Blinkit, the competition is set to get fierce as Swiggy seeks to bolster presence in the public market with more money in its pocket.

The shift from kiranas to quick commerce
As quick commerce rises, it is slowly eating into India's traditional
kirana stores
, which number around 12 million and have long been the backbone of neighborhood retail. Platforms like Blinkit, Instamart, Zepto, and Big Basket are now offering competitive pricing, often 10% to 15% lower than local shops, driving consumers to shift their grocery shopping habits.
According to Sahil Barua, CEO of
Delhivery
, quick commerce is largely impacting kirana stores, not e-commerce or direct-to-consumer (D2C) businesses.

Death of the kirana store: Will quick commerce quicken it?
Offline retailers, big as well as small, feel threatened by consumers getting accustomed to buying online for ease, speed and better prices. Recently, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal raised concern about the functioning of the e-commerce sector, saying that e-commerce is eating into the small retailers by giving heavy discounts on products. Goyal charged e-commerce players with predatory pricing and not giving a level playing field to small retailers.
With both Zomato and Swiggy increasing their focus on quick commerce, the pressure on kiranas is expected to grow.

Beyond kirana, e-commerce is winning another front. Here's what can happen
Zomato’s quick commerce spurt
Rising contributions from quick-commerce vertical Blinkit and business-to-business grocery supply unit Hyperpure had largely contributed to Zomato’s first quarter earnings for FY25. Blinkit, which market analysts suggest is driving the upside in Zomato’s valuation, has extended its aggressive expansion plan. Its chief executive Albinder Dhindsa said Blinkit now aims to have 2,000 dark stores by the end of 2026.
Also Read:
Zomato’s revenue rises 74% on Blinkit, Hyperpure surge
Blinkit recorded a gross order value (GOV) of Rs 4,923 crore, up 130% year-on-year. Dhindsa said this was mainly on account of incremental growth in consumption, as well as a shift in share from next-day ecommerce and mid-premium range modern retail in large cities.
Will fresh funds turn Swiggy around?
Swiggy’s IPO is expected to bring in significant capital, which the company plans to use to scale its operations and compete more aggressively with Zomato.
“There is a lot of interest for Swiggy because we do not have too many internet-first companies which are expected to report handsome growth of 30-35% on a consistent basis and also show an improved margin trajectory. If you look at the various online businesses, in fact, even the Swiggy DRHP has pointed out, we have got close to about 200 million online shoppers. And if you look at the quick commerce, it is only about 20 million odd users in terms of online. So, clearly there is a lot of opportunity here in terms of penetration, in terms of user growth, in terms of driving profitability through various levers,” Taurani said.
However, the analyst believes that Swiggy has an uphill battle ahead.
In terms of scale, Zomato currently leads, being 90% to 95% bigger in quick commerce and 25% to 30% larger in food delivery. Swiggy’s Instamart is still facing significant losses, over Rs 1,000 crore, while Blinkit is nearing breakeven.
Swiggy’s ability to grow its user base and improve profitability will be crucial to its turnaround.
“The listing is going to be very exciting. It is going to keep Zomato also on its toes,” Taurani said.
Zomato in terms of execution has been top-notch, as per Taurani. The company has been aggressive. He further said that the company has been performing well, be it profitability and growth within the quick commerce segment or growth in the food delivery segment.
It will be interesting to see how things change from here after Swiggy's listing.
“If you look at the food business, Zomato was at about 2.8% EBITDA as percentage of GOV and if you look at Swiggy, the food business, they were at breakeven. And similar is the case for quick commerce as well, Swiggy Instamart is still making losses of more than thousand crores and Blinkit is largely on the path to a breakeven,” Taurani added.
Quick Commerce: The next big game
Quick commerce is expected to be the main growth driver for both Swiggy and Zomato, with the segment poised to expand at a rate of 60% to 80%. Zomato, which has established itself as the market leader, will continue to focus on Blinkit growth, while Swiggy aims to catch up through Instamart. This expansion is not just limited to groceries but is also starting to affect other segments like electronics and FMCG, with e-commerce companies now feeling the pressure and exploring quick commerce offerings of their own.
Furthermore, Swiggy’s IPO will undoubtedly shake up the quick commerce landscape, intensifying the competition with Zomato.
The two well-known brands (Blinkit and Instamart) have also been facing a tough competition from existing players like Zepto and BigBasket's BB Now.
The quick commerce sector is experiencing significant growth as various e-commerce companies venture into this fast-paced delivery model. This trend indicates that established e-commerce players are also feeling the impact of quick commerce, prompting their involvement in this emerging market.
Taurani, during the interview with ET NOW, expressed optimism about the sustainability of quick commerce. He stated, “I think quick commerce in terms of business model, economics, profitability is quite sustainable.” He highlighted the potential for quick commerce to expand beyond metropolitan areas into non-metro cities, suggesting there is room for multiple players in this space.

SpaceMantra pulls out resolution plan for Future Lifestyle,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/spacemantra-pulls-out-resolution-plan-for-future-lifestyle/articleshow/113826495.cms,30-09-2024,"Mumbai:
SpaceMantra
, the winning bidder to take over
Kishore Biyani
's retail brand outlet
Future Lifestyle Fashions
(FLFL), has withdrawn its resolution plan for the company days before lenders overwhelmingly voted for it, putting creditors of the debt-laden company in a quandary.
SpaceMantra, promoted by former NBCC chairman
Anoop Kumar Mittal
, along with two individuals, Sandeep Gupta and Shalini Gupta, had emerged as the sole bidder for FLFL after almost an 18-month process since the company was admitted to bankruptcy in May 2023.
The retailer of construction, building material and office furniture had placed a ₹490 crore bid to beat the early interest shown by
Donear Industries
among others.
The company was supposed to pay ₹490 crore within 90 days of the
NCLT
approval according to its timeline submitted to lenders, working out to a 14% recovery for creditors. However, even as lenders put to vote its proposal earlier this month, the SpaceMantra-led consortium changed its mind. In a letter to the resolution professional (RP) Ravi Sethia on September 25, the consortium said it was no longer interested in continuing its resolution plan.
""On account of the inordinate delay leading to erosion of the value of inventory and other assets of the corporate debtor and the changed circumstances in the intervening period, we are hereby informing you that we are no longer interested in continuing with our resolution plan and we are hereby withdrawing the process,"" the letter accessed by ET said.
Live Events
This letter, which came just two days before the end of the voting period, was followed by a creditors' meeting on September 26 in which voting was concluded and subsequently the SpaceMantra consortium was unanimously declared the winning bidder through a stock market disclosure on September 28.
""It is imperative to note that the resolution plan submitted by the resolution applicant which was put to vote pursuant to the discussions of the 21st CoC meeting held on August 13 has been approved by the CoC with the requisite majority....Therefore you are required to comply with the terms and unconditionally accept the letter of intent issued to you by the undersigned on September 27,"" RP Sethia said in an email response accessed by ET. Sethia did not reply to an email seeking comment.
A senior SpaceMantra official confirmed that the company has withdrawn from its bid for FLFL because of the delays in the process. The company did not reply to an email seeking comment.
Creditors are now insisting that the company complete its obligation and fulfil the payments due. ""It seems that SpaceMantra was backed by a large corporate group which has pulled out. SpaceMantra, on its own, could never be taken seriously, but since it was the only bidder, banks had no choice but to accept the bid. This turn of events highlighted the challenges banks face in recovery as bidders can never be trusted to fulfill their commitment,"" said a person aware of the details.
Creditors are now looking at impounding the ₹2 crore earnest money deposited by the consortium, but admit they have very little recourse beyond that.
The latest updated claims show that FLFL, the owner of retail chains
Central and Brand Factory
, owes creditors including bondholders a total of ₹3,478 crore.
State Bank of India
(SBI) is the lead lender with claims of ₹477 crore. Bondholders represented by Catalyst Trusteeship and Centbank Financial Services are owed about ₹1,100 crore. SBI did not reply to an email seeking comment.
At its peak, FLFL used to operate more than 300 stores selling clothes, footwear and accessories of various third-party and in-house brands.

The company has had performances by Marian Brothers, Saroj Kashyap Collective, Kalatva and in-house band, Noiseters, while Geo+Mqube set the tone at the BBD kick-off event. At competitor Amazon India, a spokesperson said that prioritising employee engagement and well-being is key as their dedication and customer obsession during these times drives success.
“From cultural activities and theme days, leadership presence alongside the team, we celebrate milestones, give shout-outs from leaders, ensure availability of food and snacks, and 24-hour commute arrangements for those working late. Our approach ensures that each team member feels valued and connected,” the spokesperson said.
After the peak period, teams are encouraged to adopt ‘hush hours,’ allowing them to re-energise. Meesho has organised a festive feast for employees and also has the Merch Bazaar, for employees to shop from in-house designed merchandise.
“Meeting rooms are equipped with everything from tools and technology to snacks, energy drinks and bean bags, and our leadership team, including founders Vidit and Sanjeev, have been actively motivating teams,” said Ashish Kumar Singh, CHRO, Meesho. For the fourth year running, the company will give employees a nine-day reset and recharge break towards the end of October.
Besides celebrations and a Festive FWD fashion show, Myntra has introduced initiatives like doorstep cab services for female employees working late and fully stocked pantries for those clocking extra hours. “In addition, regular on-floor fun activities, nap pods for rest, constant reminders for prioritising breaks and leadership’s active engagement are keeping the energy and camaraderie high,” said Govindraj M K, CHRO, Myntra.
Online players are also doing their bit for workers involved in last-mile deliveries or warehouse operations, who are the backbone of operations, said staffing firms.
Companies are providing festive bonuses, additional allowances, or overtime pay as incentives. These are being paired with recognition programmes, meal allowances, or festive gifts, ensuring that these essential workers feel appreciated and motivated to meet increased demands, said Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO of CIEL HR. “Happy employees are more likely to provide better customer service, which is especially important during peak seasons. Moreover, it strengthens employee loyalty,” he added.
Manu Saigal, director – general staffing at Adecco said that e-commerce and delivery companies are introducing attendance bonuses to reward workers for consistent attendance during peak periods. Some employers offer prizes such as smartphones and motorbikes to ensure a motivated and efficient workforce.
Amazon is running the Delivery Premier League, a cricket-themed engagement programme for its delivery associates where top-scoring Flex Delivery partners who meet certain goals will be eligible for rewards and recognition. For its larger supply chain workforce and last mile wishmasters, Flipkart has activities including games, yoga sessions, milestone celebrations with cake cutting, etc. At Myntra, fun activities, relaxation sessions and recognition programmes are dialled up further for the larger supply chain workforce, in addition to initiatives to ensure holistic wellbeing.

Quick Commerce sale in India surge by 280 per cent over two years: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-sale-in-india-surge-by-280-per-cent-over-two-years-report/articleshow/113760320.cms,28-09-2024,"New Delhi: India's
quick commerce
industry has witnessed remarkable growth, with sales surging by more than 280 per cent over the last two years, according to a report by financial services firm Chryseum.
The report highlighted that the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of quick commerce in India increased from USD 0.5 billion in FY22 to a staggering USD 3.3 billion in FY24, which is a 280 per cent increase.
Quick commerce, which refers to the rapid delivery of small orders within a short time frame, is growing at a much faster pace than traditional e-commerce.
The report noted that while India's e-commerce sector is registering an annual growth rate of 14 per cent, quick commerce has expanded at an impressive 73 per cent annual growth rate during FY 2023-24. This highlights the significant shift in consumer behavior towards faster and more convenient delivery options.
The quick commerce market in India is currently valued at USD 3.34 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 9.95 billion by 2029, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 4.5 per cent over the forecast period (2024-2029).
Live Events
""The Quick Commerce Industry in India Market size is estimated at USD 3.34 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 9.95 billion by 2029"" said the report.
Despite this rapid growth, the sector remains relatively untapped, with a penetration rate of only 7 per cent of the total addressable market, which is valued at USD 45 billion. This indicates a significant opportunity for further expansion, with quick commerce already surpassing the market size of food delivery.
The report also mentioned that to capitalize on this potential, quick commerce platforms are increasingly partnering with manufacturers for direct sourcing, bypassing traditional distributor networks. This strategy enables platforms to streamline operations, reduce costs, and offer more competitive pricing to consumers.
""Quick Commerce platforms are partnering with manufacturers for direct sourcing, to bypass the traditional distributor network"" the report added.
Furthermore, the tech infrastructure of quick commerce platforms is designed to ensure continuous improvements in operational processes, enhancing agility and speed across the value chain. These innovations are helping quick commerce platforms to deliver faster and more efficiently, meeting the growing demand for instant deliveries in India.
As the industry continues to evolve, experts predict that quick commerce will play an increasingly important role in India's retail landscape.

Did Flipkart sell the Apple iPhone 13 for just Rs 11 during the Big Billion Days sale? Here's everything about the controversy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/did-flipkart-sell-the-apple-iphone-13-for-just-rs-11-during-the-big-billion-days-sale-heres-everything-about-the-controversy/articleshow/113757407.cms,28-09-2024,"Flipkart
customers are upset over a recent promotion that advertised the
iPhone 13
for Rs 11 as part of the
Big Billion Days
sale. The promotion, held under the '
Fastest Fingers First
' offer, teased the iPhone 13 at 11 PM. Many customers expected to purchase the iPhone at this price but faced disappointment.
Several users reported seeing the product go out of stock within minutes, while others claimed they encountered technical issues during the purchase process. Some mentioned their orders were later canceled despite securing the deal.
Customers expressed their frustrations on the microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter). One user remarked, ""Is fraud really happening in Flipkart. An investigation should be done to find out who all have been cheated.??There should be no injustice with the common people."" Another stated, “If you were trying to get an iPhone 13 for ?11 at 11 PM then probably you were probably fooled. This is one of the marketing gimmicks used by online shopping platforms to create buzz. 'Sold Out' message will pop up for everyone.”
Others were disappointed by the sudden price change. One user shared, ""@Flipkart i cant even imagine Flipkart will do such type of scams. they were going to offer Iphone 13 today at Rs.11 at MIDNIGHT. We were sitting since 7 p.m , but suddenly it was showing Rs.49,900. Its not acceptable @Flipkart its called mentally harassing peoples.”
""
Flipkart
has created a lot of excitement with their new promotion! They're announcing fresh deals daily, and now they're offering the iPhone 13 for just ₹11! But before the deal even began, it was already SOLD OUT. Is this just a marketing tactic, or is there an actual problem? Many users are disappointed and are calling it a scam, which is why
#FlipkartScam
is trending,"" wrote another.

Amazon and Samara Capital pump more money into More Retail to expand grocery business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazon-and-samara-capital-pump-more-money-into-more-retail-to-expand-grocery-business/articleshow/113705487.cms,27-09-2024,"Parents
Amazon
and private equity firm
Samara Capital
are pumping in huge money in grocery retail chain,
More Retail
which last fiscal received over Rs 387 crore of capital infusion, as the retailer enters new markets and acts as the fulfilment point of Amazon's
grocery business
under Fresh and quick commerce which they plan to enter.
As per latest Registrar of Companies filings made by the company, the
funding
is continuing in the current fiscal too with the promoters pumping in Rs 145 crore with the last round completing on Wednesday. In 2022-23, the promoters had funded Rs 300 crore in More Retail while in 2021-22 it was Rs 400 crore, as per the filings accessed from business intelligence firm AltInfo.
More Retail is also on a path to reduce losses by shutting down unprofitable stores since last fiscal and expects to achieve break-even in the third quarter of this fiscal, the company told ET. It said the Amazon business is growing at 60%-plus.
In response to an email sent to More Retail managing director Vinod Nambiar, the company said the equity infusion is being used to meet the increased working capital requirement on account of a growing business, investment to improve stock availability across stores and to 10,000-plus stock keeping units for online consumers.
The current year funding is to support the increased demand across online and offline channels, it said. More has enabled omni-channel to 280-plus stores over the last two years and optimized omni store capex model to open stores in a rapid and cost efficient manner. “Our plan is to open around 100 stores in the next 3-4 quarters,” it said.

More Retail runs a chain of hyper and supermarkets across India with 777 stores. The company said with More now present in 300 towns, it is bringing Amazon Fresh to the hitherto unserved parts of the country.
Samara and Amazon took over the More retail business from the Aditya Birla Group in 2019.
“Despite raising over Rs 800 crore in the past two fiscal years, More Retail struggles to gain significant market share and remains unprofitable. The recent fundraise this fiscal seems insufficient to address core issues. Without a fundamental strategy overhaul focusing on topline growth, cost-cutting measures alone are unlikely to turn the company's fortunes around,” said Mohit Yadav, founder at AltInfo.
More Retail in 2022-23 had net losses of Rs 550 crore while revenue was Rs 4507 crore.
The company told ET its closure of loss making stores last fiscal led to “significant reduction” in losses in the second half of last fiscal as compared to the first. This is even when net losses at a company level were “largely flat” in FY24. It said the operating EBITDA loss had reduced by over 60% or more than Rs 100 crore in the second half of last fiscal from the first.
“This has further improved in the current year with around 40% reduction in operating EBITDA loss in Q1 FY25 compared to Q4 FY24. Q2 FY25 is trending even better and we are on track to break-even in Q3 of this year. As a result of the strategic decision to close loss making stores, on a direct comparison our overall revenue was down by 8% (FY24 v/s FY23). However, the revenue of the live store networks of FY24 compared to FY23 was flat,” it said.

Bankruptcy court admits insolvency resolution plea against four Future Group affiliates,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/bankruptcy-court-admits-insolvency-resolution-plea-against-four-future-group-affiliates/articleshow/113696227.cms,26-09-2024,"The
bankruptcy court
has recently admitted four companies affiliated with the
Future Group
including Future Corporate Resources Pvt Ltd and Central Departmental Stores Pvt Ltd under the corporate
insolvency resolution
process (CIRP) in an application filed by the
Central Bank of India
.
The other companies include Ojas Tradelease and Mall Management Pvt Ltd and Iskrupa Mall Management Company Pvt Ltd. While admitting these companies through separate orders, the Mumbai bench of the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT) has appointed Avil Jerome Menezes as interim resolution professional (IRP) of these companies.
“During the CIRP period, the management of the corporate debtor shall vest in the IRP or, as the case may be, the RP…” noted the division bench of judicial member KR Saji Kumar and technical member Sanjiv Dutt in its order against Central Departmental Stores. “ The officers and managers of the corporate debtor are directed to provide effective assistance to the IRP as and when he takes charge of the assets and management of the corporate debtor,” said the tribunal in its September 24 order.
Future Corporate Resources and Central Departmental Stores provided corporate guarantees for Future Group’s other affiliate Syntex Trading and Agency Pvt Ltd to the Central Bank of India for a loan in December 2019. The order in this case noted that the principal borrower failed to honour its obligation to repay in March 2022 and its loan account was classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) in April 2022.
The tribunal noted that the amount of financial debt claimed to be in default is Rs 420 crore as of May 29, 2022, along with the interest and other charges.

In separate orders, the tribunal has admitted Iskrupa Mall Management Company after the company defaulted on its dues of about Rs 72 crore in May 2022. The lender had granted a term loan of Rs 150 crore in September 2015 to the company. Whereas, Ojas Tradelease and Mall Management Company was a corporate guarantor to Iskrupa Mall Management Company Pvt Ltd and hence admitted under the CIRP.
The order noted that the principal borrower in this case failed to honour its obligation to repay the principal and interest due on March 31, 2022 and its loan account was classified as a Non-Performing Asset on April 30, 2022.

"India’s ‘swipe-up’ generation set to swipe right on festive deals, driving sales this season",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indias-swipe-up-generation-set-to-swipe-right-on-festive-deals-driving-sales-this-season/articleshow/113686515.cms,26-09-2024,"Brands in India are set to strike gold with
Gen Z
this festive season, as the “swipe-up” generation is expected to drive the nation’s shopping spirit and boost sales for the industry.
In this three-month festive window, consumer spending is seen to skyrocket and
online shopping
will boom, creating a golden opportunity for brands to engage this app-first generation.
Indian consumers are expected to increase their spending by an average of 47 per cent, with an average budget of Rs 25,000, Dhruv Dhawan, Head Ads, Disney+ Hotstar, India, said.
But what makes this generation, often scolded by parents for being glued to their phones 24/7, the trailblazers of India’s online shopping scene?

Gen Z Power: The ‘swipe-up’ generation is exciting business opportunity for Myntra, CMO says
The answer lies in the numbers. India’s swipe-up generation, born between 1996 and 2010, is the world's largest according to a report by Bernstein. Indian Gen Zs make up 20 per cent of the world and about 27 per cent of India's population, it noted.
ET Online
The country now has an estimated 175 million online lifestyle shoppers, making about six and seven transactions per year, with one in three belonging to Gen Z.
The average budget for Gen Z this coming season is Rs 23,000, as per the findings of Disney+ Hotstar’s festive sentiment survey 2024.

App-first Gen Z scripting big shifts in consumption trends: Bernstein report
Indians are going to go all in this festive season as they plan to spend across various categories, with apparel and fashion (28%), mobile phones (28%), and beauty and wellness (25%) leading the list, according to the third edition of Disney+ Hotstar’s festive shopping sentiment survey 2024. Additionally, a significant portion of the budget is allocated for tech upgrades, particularly 5G-enabled mobile phones and smart TVs.
E-commerce websites will remain the go-to destination for Indians, with 59 per cent of shoppers opting for online purchases. The dominance of online ads will also be further cemented with 58 per cent of buyers relying on them for product information.
Gen Zs and their “loyalty”
There has never been a better time for brands in India and the shopping spree of Gen Z in the coming season might as well be their added bonus (and not a small one, given the numbers.)
Gen Zs have significant headroom in consumption, contributing to about 17 per cent of India's total consumption.

Blinkit, Zepto pilot returns, exchanges to ace fashion ecommerce
If a brand is loyal to Gen Z, Gen Z will be loyal to the brand, Sunder Balasubramanian, Chief Marketing Officer, Myntra told ET Online in an interview.
Gen Z shoppers buy eight to nine times a year as opposed to their millennial (people born between 1981–1996) counterparts who buy five to six times a year, as they are exposed to global trends and their cycle of adoption is very quick, Nandita Sinha, chief executive of Myntra told ET.
This itself is a great indication of the kind of “impact that they can drive,” Balasubramanian added.
“FOMO” pushing Gen Z to spend more?
If a brand is trending, then it is likely to have piqued this generation’s attention as it thrives on staying updated with the latest designs and real-time viral trends. But this is not it.
""In addition to expressing their identity, financial independence is crucial,"" said Myntra’s CMO.
Contrary to the belief that they lack disposable income, over 70 per cent of Gen Z engage in side hustles, making them an exciting audience for brands.
Gen Z behaviour has helped scale up internet use cases driving monthly or daily active users (MAU/DAU) growth across app ecosystems.
The not-so ‘lowkey’ social media influence
The Gen Z generation that swipes up for practically everything shopping, dating, food delivery, has subtly (lowkey in Gen Z terms) been shaped by social media.
""D2C brands are scaling faster versus traditional FMCG (3-4 years vs 10 years) led by the buying power of Gen Z customers. They have been able to target Gen Z customers through social media,"" Bernstein report said.
India is the world's largest footprint for Meta across their app universe (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, FB messenger), it said, adding that quick commerce platforms like Blinkit and Zepto are enabling digital-first brands to reach GenZ customers, rapidly driving growth.
Millennials to join the mega bandwagon
If Gen Zs are set to become the driving force behind India’s consumer spending this festive season, then millennials will serve as the steering wheel.
As per Disney+ Hotstar’s Dhawan, millennials’ average budget this coming season is Rs 27,000 i.e. 17 per cent higher than that of Gen Z.
While these adjacent generations share a keen appetite for shopping, their consumption behaviours, preferences, and adoption styles vary distinctly.
The Bernstein report observed, ""GenZ prefer categories which are app-first digitally-native and prefer categories like quick commerce, food delivery, short-form videos, EdTech, athleisure, co-living, new age D2C brands,""
This is very different from 'millennials' who prefer e-commerce, multiplexes, OTT, casual wear, and renting; and 'Gen X' who veers towards offline retail, malls, kiranas, office wear, Bollywood movies, buying houses/ real estate, or the baby 'boomer generation', which goes for kiranas, home food, traditional wear and are more inclined towards savings.

India's retail has a spring in its step: High-end shopping malls,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indias-retail-has-a-spring-in-its-step-high-end-shopping-malls/articleshow/113664725.cms,26-09-2024,"India’s retail sector is undergoing a rapid transformation, and a few radical shifts. E-commerce was supposed to replace the
brick-and-mortar retail
, especially after Covid when a large number of Indians got used to buy small as well as big items online.
But the new consumption
trend of premiumisation
, where consumers are willing to splurge on expensive items, is bringing back brick-and-mortar retail in the shape of
high-end shopping malls
where customers can touch and feel high-value products and have a superior shopping experience. As
premiumisation
sweeps across India's retail sector, demand for premium shopping malls is increasing.
The rise of premium India
Historically, Indian consumers have been cautious spenders, focusing on savings and purchasing essentials. However, with rising disposable incomes and evolving lifestyle aspirations, a shift towards
discretionary spending
is becoming evident. The trend may have picked up more during the Covid pandemic, when affluent consumers, unable to travel, would have begun splurging on luxury products such as large televisions, home appliances, and premium food and beverages.
The premiumisation wave continued in the first half of 2024, as
consumer goods
companies reported an uptick in sales of high-end products, reported ET, citing data from companies and researchers.
For instance, over 70% of the new products launched by
Hindustan Unilever
(HUL), India’s largest consumer goods company, over the past two years were in the premium segment. Similarly,
ITC Ltd
, a leading personal care products manufacturer, saw its premium segment products contribute 38% to the division's sales, up from 19% four years ago. This trend was also visible in other sectors, including electronics and personal care, where companies like Samsung, LG, and Vivo introduced more premium products compared to budget options.

The need for better shopping malls
This shift in consumer preferences has thrown light on the limitations of many existing
retail spaces
, particularly the rise of ""
ghost malls
"" — poorly located shopping centers with high vacancy rates.
According to a report by Knight Frank, the number of such ghost malls increased from 57 in 2022 to 64 in 2023. The vacancies reflect the growing demand for Grade A shopping malls that are well-located, offer a superior shopping experience, and provide a mix of
luxury brands
and entertainment options.
This need for better retail spaces is leading to an expansion of high-end shopping malls across India. Cushman & Wakefield (C&W), a real estate consultancy, projected that 18 million square feet of new retail space would be added between 2024 and 2027 across India’s top eight cities. However, this is just a third of the estimated 55 million square feet required to meet the demand for premium retail spaces. C&W highlighted that India’s retail space per capita is still lagging behind other South Asian countries like Indonesia and Thailand, underscoring the potential for growth in the sector.
Smaller cities' growing demand
In addition to traditional Grade A malls, factory outlet malls are also being planned to compete with the growing dominance of e-commerce platforms. These shopping malls aim to offer consumers premium products at discounted prices, appealing to broader range of shoppers who may be hesitant to buy luxury goods online.
In addition, the expansion of malls is not just limited to metropolitan areas. Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities are witnessing a surge in the development of high-end retail spaces.
Cities like Gurugram are seeing a rise in demand for one-stop shopping destinations that combine retail, entertainment, and community engagement, ET has reported, quoting Pradeep Aggarwal, Chairman of Signature Global. Similarly, Uddhav Poddar, Managing Director of Bhumika Group, said that the combination of shopping and leisure is one of the strongest draws for malls, further driving their growth in smaller cities.
Infrastructure upgrade and an increase in leisure travel may also become a big growth driver for highway retail, prompting developers to build malls on highways, according to experts. Brands such as Tata Croma, Starbucks, Uniqlo, Hippo Stores and Mothercare have either opened or are in the process of opening stores on highways.
Luxury brands hike demand
The rise of premium malls and the increased demand for luxury goods have opened lucrative opportunities for international retailers, just as global luxury brands entering India has led to demand for more premium mall spaces. Many global luxury brands are betting big on India, opening more outlets and occupying prime retail space in high-end malls. This influx of international brands is driving foreign investment into India’s retail sector, further boosting the country’s economy.
As India continues to develop its infrastructure and expand its retail spaces, the country is expected to attract even more investment. The combination of rising consumer confidence, increasing discretionary spending, and the development of premium retail spaces is positioning India’s retail sector for sustained growth over the coming years.

Over 30% shoppers relying on quick commerce for core needs: NielsenIQ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/over-30-shoppers-relying-on-quick-commerce-for-core-needs-nielseniq/articleshow/113633851.cms,24-09-2024,"Quick commerce
has emerged as a pivotal growth driver in
grocery shopping
, with 31%
Indian shoppers
relying on quick commerce for their core grocery needs, while 39% use such platforms for top-up purchases, a
NielsenIQ
Shopper Trends 2024 report, released Tuesday, said.
The report by the research and analytics company noted that 42% of shoppers use quick commerce for ready-to-eat meals, and 45% for salty snacks.
Economic challenges and shifting preferences are leading an increasing number of shoppers to adapt to rising
food prices
, new shopping channels, and product category innovations, the report said.
Mitesh Dabrai, executive director, consumer & marketing insights at
NIQ
said: “Shoppers today are more discerning, price-conscious, and channel-agnostic. The doubling of quick commerce usage signals an urgent need for FMCG brands to prioritise convenience and speed, while simultaneously addressing value perceptions.”
Live Events
The report said with 87% of shoppers feeling the impact of rising food prices, businesses need to focus on strategic pricing and promotions to maintain shopper loyalty. It added that 67% shoppers seek out premium
private labels
.
According to the report, increasingly, shoppers are using online platforms not only for fill-in shopping but also for their monthly purchases, with both types of shopping seeing an uptick across all trade types.
E-commerce platforms
are becoming a go-to for essential staples, with 60% of shoppers in India turning to online platforms for these purchases.
The report also noted that promotions continue to influence store and brand choices, with 40% of modern trade shoppers switching stores based on
promotional offers
.
“As shoppers increasingly embrace multichannel shopping, 20% of offline shoppers also turn to online stores for their grocery needs. Non-metro shoppers are leaning towards using online stores for top-ups,” it added.
Staples, fresh foods, and snacks are among the categories most affected by price sensitivity, and within non-food categories such as laundry and dental care products, shoppers are adopting similar cost-saving behaviour, the report noted.

Design architecture for B2C e-invoicing mostly ready: GSTN CEO,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/design-architecture-for-b2c-e-invoicing-mostly-ready-gstn-ceo/articleshow/113630566.cms,24-09-2024,"New Delhi: The design architecture for implementing
GST e-invoicing
for retailers is mostly ready and being vetted by industry experts,
GST Network
CEO
Manish Kumar Sinha
said on Tuesday. E-invoicing is already present in the B2B sector. The
GST Council
, in its meeting earlier this month, decided to extend
e-invoice
to the B2C sector on a pilot basis.
Sinha said the GST department is currently in discussion with the industry for the issuance of
electronic invoices
for every B2C transaction.
""Initially, we will do a pilot project. The design of the architecture is mostly done, and we are getting it vetted by some of the best people we have in the industry. After that, we will release a document on how to go about it,"" Sinha said at an
Assocham
event here.
The threshold for businesses that would be required to issue e-invoices is in the process of being decided.
""We have to give time to the industry, particularly, small mom-and-pop stores. What we want to get right is the technology. Large organised retail, e-commerce operator, big companies...have a good IT set up with them, ... at least encourage them to start adopting it,"" Sinha said.
Live Events
Under
Goods and Services Tax
(GST) law, e-invoicing for business-to-business (B2B) transactions was made mandatory for companies with turnover of over Rs 500 crore from October 1, 2020. It was gradually extended to those with a turnover of over Rs 5 crore.

Apparel retail chains projected to grow 8-10% this fiscal year amid fast fashion boom,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/apparel-retail-chains-projected-to-grow-8-10-this-fiscal-year-amid-fast-fashion-boom/articleshow/113629066.cms,24-09-2024,"Brick-and-mortar apparel retail chains are expected to grow by 8-10% this fiscal year, according to
CRISIL Ratings
. This growth will be driven by higher demand due to normal monsoon, easing inflation, festive and
wedding season
, and increasing preference for
fast fashion
.
The revenue growth will be slower than the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11-12% between 2018 and 2023.
CRISIL said retailers will be focused on improving efficiency at the existing stores, controlling costs, and limiting dependence on external debt rather than opening new stores. They will continue to expand in tiers 2 and 3, which are increasingly moving towards organized retail.
The area addition will be 2.2 million square feet compared to 3.6 million square feet last fiscal year as the store sizes will be smaller.
Owing to the muted growth in same-store sales, the revenue per square foot is expected to remain flat at Rs 11,900 per square foot.

Anil More, associate director at CRISIL Ratings said, “The marginal increase in profitability this fiscal will be driven by apparel retailers streamlining existing stores and opening new stores only as necessary, given that demand has not fully recovered.” He added that the overall operating margin will be limited to 7.2-7.4% compared to 7% in fiscal 2024 because of higher discounts and marketing spending to attract consumers.
The mass market is dominating the apparel retail business, followed by premium and luxury.
Anuj Sethi, senior director at CRISIL Ratings said, “The mass market segment accounts for around 60% of total sales now, compared to 56% before the pandemic, due to the rising popularity of fast fashion, which is expected to be the primary revenue driver this fiscal. The likely increase in demand for premium clothing during the upcoming festive and wedding seasons will also contribute to overall revenue growth of 8-10% this fiscal.”
To commit to the evolving consumer behaviour towards fast fashion, retailers are enhancing business strategies, supply chain efficiency, and focusing on new trends.
“Better inventory management and stable input costs will prevent significant inventory write-offs, unlike last fiscal when sharp cost changes lowered profitability by 100-110 basis points,” CRISIL Ratings said in a press note.
The ratios of interest coverage and total debt/earnings before interest taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)of the apparel retailers are predicted to be 6.2 times and 1.7 times in the fiscal year 2025.

Future Group
’s affiliate
Acute Retail Infra
Pvt Ltd for
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process
(CIRP) in an application filed by
Avendus Finance
Pvt Ltd after the company defaulted on its dues of over Rs 65 crore.
The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) while admitting the company has also appointed Ramesh M. Shetty as interim resolution professional (IRP) of the company.
“During the CIRP period, the management of the corporate debtor will vest in the IRP/RP,” said the division bench of judicial member Reeta Kohli and technical member Madhu Sinha in its order of September 23. “The board of directors of the Corporate Debtor shall stand suspended.”
Before the tribunal’s order, counsel Nausher Kohli, on behalf of Avendus Finance argued that along with Shapoorji Pallonji Finance Pvt Ltd and Visu Leasing and Finance Pvt Ltd, it agreed to provide a term loan facility of Rs 115 crore to the Acute Retail Infra.

The lender argued that Acute Retail Infra and Future Retail Ltd (FRL) agreed, wherein, the debtor company had leased out some equipment owned by it such as plant and machinery, spares, and tools to FRL against the payment of lease rentals.
Under the Facility Agreement of March 9, 2018, Acute Retail Infra agreed to deposit the lease rentals receivable by it from FRL into an escrow account, and accordingly, the escrow agreement was executed between the corporate debtor, security trustee and
HDFC Bank
(escrow bank).
The company further argued that FRL failed to make the payments towards the lease rentals from March 2022, therefore, triggering an event of default under the Master Lease Agreement and Facility Documents. Subsequently, the lender issued a notice to the company in April 2022.
However, countering this, advocate Malhar Zatakia, appearing for the company argued that it is a running entity having employees and thus no fruitful purpose would be served if the same is subjected to CIRP.
Currently, several companies including Future Retail,
Future Enterprises
, Future Supply and Chain and Future Lifestyle and Fashion are among the key companies promoted by Kishore Biyani that are undergoing a corporate insolvency process.

Rapid growth of quick commerce fuels wave of 'enabler' tech startups,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/rapid-growth-of-quick-commerce-fuels-wave-of-enabler-tech-startups/articleshow/113557226.cms,22-09-2024,"Mumbai: A fresh wave of 'enabler' startups is transforming India's booming
quick commerce
(Qcomm) ecosystem, sparked by rapid growth of
hyperlocal startups
, coupled with the entry of new startups, established e-commerce firms, and new-age brands racing to shorten delivery times.
Several early-stage venture firms are actively evaluating investment opportunities in this burgeoning space, ET has learnt.
""There are obviously some overlaps with e-commerce, and hence, some existing enabling technologies can assist quick commerce; however, quick commerce sometimes requires its own enablements,"" said Kunal Bahl, cofounder of
Titan Capital
and AceVector Group, which runs Snapdeal and Unicommerce.
Bahl added that Titan Capital has invested in Blitz, a startup building a third-party
dark store network
to support quick commerce for brands. Other areas it has evaluated startups include products that allow
order management
across multiple quick commerce platforms.
Another startup,
Gurugram-based Zippee
, which recently closed a funding round, enables two-hour and same-day deliveries for more than 140 new-age and established brands such as Frido, Ultrahuman and Haldiram's. The company gives access to dark stores to fulfil orders in a dozen cities including New Delhi, Chennai, Ludhiana and Pune.

Other emerging platforms are also starting to offer their services to quick commerce startups, which experts say could be challenging. Bahl said such companies building for quick commerce firms such as Blinkit and Zepto may face challenges due to their tech-native nature, adding that ""the opportunity lies in creating products for brands now managing orders across various distribution channels.""
A senior executive at one of the largest quick commerce platforms, said while new entrants are offering a range of services such as Software as a Service (SaaS) products, logistics, and real estate solutions, the limited addressable market of 8-9 major companies may pose a challenge going forward.
Nitin Sharma, partner at early-stage fund Antler, offered a balanced view on the emergence of such ventures. ""There are two contrasting angles to explore in this space,"" he notes. ""On one hand, the growth of quick commerce may soon require its own 'enabler' ecosystem of startups. These startups will help large platforms scale further across inventory management, dark store operations, and last-mile logistics.""
However, Sharma also acknowledged potential challenges. ""How quick commerce will evolve in non-metro and tier I markets remains unclear. Additionally, local kiranas and general trade stores must adapt to retain their more profitable customers.
Take the instance of Mumbai-based Dava Ninja, which started operations this April to enable pharmacies deliver medicines within 60 minutes. While it does not have a delivery fleet, it helps local pharmacies digitise by providing an app-based ordering service, essentially aggregating pharmacies within a locality and routing orders based on location and inventory data. Its operations are still nascent, with 20 pharmacy partners.
To be sure, firms that support digitisation of kirana stores have been around since the pandemic.
Vaibhav Domkundwar, CEO of Better Capital, which has backed startups like Slice, M2P, and Teachmint, said his fund began exploring startups in the faster delivery space three years ago when it invested in Bengaluru-based Yulu, a provider of low-speed electric two-wheeler services.
""Over the past 18 months, it became clear that quick commerce has strong potential to succeed in India despite its failures in many other global markets. Once we realised quick commerce was here to stay, we shifted our focus to 'what else will be built around it' and identified vertical quick commerce as a promising opportunity,” said Domkundwar.
To capitalise on the trend, Better Capital led a $300,000 in a funding round of Slikk, a Gen Z-focused app offering 60-minute clothing delivery.
As quick commerce firms expand their product categories into areas like luggage, fashion, toys, and electronics, major e-commerce firms are accelerating their delivery timelines to meet evolving consumer expectations.
For example, beauty retailer Nykaa has ramped up its express delivery service in major cities, while Amazon is expanding its same-day delivery network to fulfil orders for Prime members faster. Tata-owned BigBasket is set to fully pivot to 10–30-minute delivery, as reported by ET in August, and Flipkart’s quick commerce service ‘Minutes’ went live in Bengaluru the same month.
Established e-commerce enablers like Unicommerce have built capabilities that enable brands to simplify selling through quick commerce. Third-party logistics providers such as Delhivery and Xpressbees are also expanding their services to support quick commerce startups, as ET reported in June. This will make the market increasingly competitive for new players.

"Amazon's home, kitchen and outdoors category witnesses 25-27% CAGR in 3-year period",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazons-home-kitchen-and-outdoors-category-witness-25-27-cagr-in-3-year-period/articleshow/113530347.cms,20-09-2024,"New Delhi: The 3-year compound annual growth rate (
CAGR
) of the Home, Kitchen, and Outdoors category of
Amazon
India is 25-27%, K.N. Srikanth, category’s director at Amazon India told ET.
“Home, Kitchen, and Outdoor are one of the fastest growing categories for Amazon in India,” he said.
The category is poised to grow at about 40-42% year-on-year this festive season. He added that the
installation services
adoption is potentially going to triple during the season.
Newer categories that were launched in the last 12 to 18 months, like
electric two-wheelers
are growing at more than 100% year-on-year.
Solar panels
and
solar lighting
are growing at 80-85% year-on-year. Wall paint is growing at 400-500% year-on-year.
Srikanth said, “For this category, I wouldn’t settle for anything less than a 10-year CAGR of maybe 25-30%.”
Live Events
For highly technical products of the category, Amazon has started pre-purchase consultations with experts. The service is currently available for water purifiers, EVs, and solar panels. It will be extended to sports and fitness instruments soon.
“We have not seen such a major impact of
quick commerce
on our business as of now. But we also recognize the importance of quick deliveries. However, right now at least, what we stand for is a really wide selection, predictable prices, and customers being able to buy by looking at reviews. We are focused on great
consumer experience
right now. But obviously, we are also evaluating how we can, in a sustainable way, deliver the orders faster to our customers,” Srikanth said, talking about competing with quick commerce. “The best reflection of this is through what we hear from brands. At least through my interactions with many of these brands, I haven’t seen anyone either complain or be heavily concerned about their business on Amazon.”

"GeM slashes transaction charges levied on sellers, service providers for public procurement",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/gem-slashes-transaction-charges-levied-on-sellers-service-providers-for-public-procurement/articleshow/113519478.cms,20-09-2024,"Public procurement
portal
GeM
has significantly slashed
transaction charges
levied on sellers and service providers on its portal, a senior government official said on Friday.
Government e-marketplace
(GeM) Additional CEO
Ajit B Chavan
said that this ""bold"" move was part of the government's 100 days initiative.
""Aligning with the government's ongoing commitment to foster
ease of doing business
and build a more inclusive economy, Government e-Marketplace has recently announced a significant reduction in the transaction charges levied on sellers, service providers transacting on its platform,"" he told reporters here.
Accordingly, GeM has announced a New Revenue Policy of the portal with effect from August 9.
As per the new policy, all orders valued up to Rs 10 Lakh will now attract zero transaction charges, as opposed to the earlier order value ceiling of Rs 5 lakh.
""Orders above Rs 10 Lakh up to Rs 10 crore will be levied transaction charges worth 0.30 per cent of total order value, as compared to earlier transaction charges of 0.45 per cent,"" he said, adding orders above Rs 10 crore will now pay a flat fee of Rs 3 lakh, a ""massive"" reduction from the transaction charges previously capped at Rs 72.5 lakh.
Live Events
He added that nearly 97 per cent of the transactions on GeM will be attracting zero transaction charges, while the remaining will incur a nominal fee at 0.30 per cent of order value above Rs 10 lakh subject to a maximum of Rs 3 lakh only, irrespective of the size of the order.
""This step is a watershed moment in terms of Ease of doing Business on GeM and is also in line with government's commitment of reduction in cost of transactions,"" he said.
He added that the latest transaction fee structure is aimed at democratizing access to public procurement ecosystem.
It aims to particularly benefit MSEs, which often face challenges navigating cumbersome financial and operational barriers.
""By considerably lowering transaction charges, GeM aims to level the playing field, thereby creating opportunities for small-scale businesses to deliver value and innovation in public procurement,"" Chavan said.
GeM is a unified digital platform that facilitates end-to-end procurement of goods and services by various central ministries, state departments, public sector enterprises, autonomous bodies, panchayats, multi and single state cooperatives. It was launched in 2016.
The online portal was established with a clear objective to eliminate age-old manual public procurement processes that were riddled with inefficiencies and corruption.

's
home and household market
is expected to reach $237 billion by 2030 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 10 %, fueled by increasing disposable income, shifting consumer preferences and a growing focus on comfort and convenience across product categories, according to a report by Deloitte.
The report titled ""Powering Consumption Growth-India's Home and House Market"", was launched at the two-day event MAPIC India 2024. It also said that the home and household market are witnessing strong demand, particularly in tier 2 and tier 3 cities that are emerging as growth hubs.
It also said that omnichannel retail and e-commerce are helping businesses connect with consumers, expanding their reach beyond urban centres.
Stating that factors such as high disposable incomes, the rise of digital platforms, easy access to credit, and young consumers seeking modern designs, home renovations and personalisation, which provide tailored offerings to consumers, are driving the demand. While the home and household industry are expanding rapidly, there are still limitations to overcome.
After-sales support, warranty worries and the need for a comprehensive omnichannel strategy are all significant issues for businesses to handle. Per the report, India's home and household market is witnessing a remarkable evolution, where consumers are gravitating towards premium and branded products, and businesses are increasingly adopting a consumer-first approach.

There is a deeper focus on
consumer experiences
and design-led product innovation,"" said Anand Ramanathan, Partner for consumer products and retail sector leader at Deloitte India.
Social media and advanced technologies enable companies to precisely target and engage their audiences, making the market more dynamic and responsive to changing needs, according to him.
According to the report, sustainability is becoming a central concern for Indian consumers, with rising demand for energy-efficient appliances and eco-friendly kitchenware and amid this manufacturers are increasingly investing in water-saving bathroom fittings, sustainable kitchen solutions and energy-efficient technologies to cater to eco-conscious consumers.
This trend, coupled with government policies such as the PLI scheme, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, SMC, UJALA and
PM Mitra
, is driving demand and attracting investments in the home and household sector, it said.
To stay ahead, companies must embrace emerging trends like quick commerce, rethink their operating models and integrate innovation across the value chain from products to post-sales services, it stated.

"Frendy to open 300 marts and a network of 10,000 micro kiranas by 2026, expects Rs 500 crore revenue",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/frendy-to-open-300-marts-and-a-network-of-10000-micro-kiranas-by-2026-expects-rs-500-crore-revenue/articleshow/113421912.cms,17-09-2024,"Frendy
, a
grocery chain
firm, said it plans to open 300 marts and achieve Rs 500 crore in revenue by 2026 to cash in on the consumer shift towards tech-enabled neighbourhood stores. At present, the firm runs over 25
mini marts
and 2,000 mini kiranas.
""The current focus is to expand the mini marts in
tier 3 towns
to 50 by the end of the year and scale to 300 by 2026. As the mini marts scale, we will also in parallel digitally connect to
micro kiranas
around these mini marts for each, so expect to have a network of 10,000 micro kiranas all in the rural catchment of the towns,"" said Sameer Gandotra, founder and CEO at Frendy adding that the current revenue is about Rs60 crore.
Unlike traditional kirana stores, where operations such as billing and sourcing are manual, the new-age
retail chains
have digital apps for orders and delivery as well as the advantage of centralised sourcing. For fast-moving consumer goods (
FMCG
) companies, these self-service outlets account for 4% of their total sales, compared to less than 1% before the pandemic. In premium categories, their contribution is much higher at 8-10%.
Frendy typically focuses on
urban villages
or towns where the population is around 10,000, making their outlet the consumers' first modern retail experience. In addition, the urban periphery of tier 2,3 cities also is also apt for their neighbourhood mini mart format. These smaller towns and periphery of tier 2 and 3 cities are a Rs10,000 crore monthly market and the company aims to get to 1% market share by 2027, it said.
""We have spent a lot of time iterating a model that is profitable, scalable and sustainable. Now we need capital to scale out the model. We are already opening five marts a month and are confident of getting that to 10 marts in the next six months,"" said Gandotra adding that its experiments with food and beverage, fruits and vegetables, children’s entertainment and digital services at the mart have shown encouraging results. ""We believe these can all be rolled out sequentially and easily double the profitability of the mart as they utilize the same asset without much incremental fixed cost.""

Quick-commerce players scaling up 24x7 deliveries as festive season sets in,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-players-scaling-up-24x7-deliveries-as-festive-season-sets-in/articleshow/113403612.cms,16-09-2024,"Quick-commerce
platforms are intensifying the expansion of their
24x7 deliveries
with the onset of
festive season
to meet
consumer demand
even in the wee hours, executives said, aggressively scaling up an experiment they had started to pilot a couple of years ago.
""To keep up with the surge in demand during the festive season,
Swiggy
Instamart has expanded operations across 11 cities in the last two months; the platform will deliver festive needs and other products round the clock,"" a spokesperson for the IPO-bound Swiggy said. Impulse categories such as salty snacks, frozen foods, chocolates, soft drinks and ice-cream tubs are among the ones ordered through the night, executives said.
Mayank Shah, vice-president at biscuits and snacks maker Parle Products, said their internal data has shown significant increase in late-night orders for salty snacks. ""This is true more so in clusters where the young population works in shifts."" Apart from daily essentials and groceries, executives at quick commerce platforms and restaurant chains said they are starting to service even all-night
food delivery
to meet consumer demand, though all-night demand for fresh food delivery are infrequent, unlike grocery.
Deepinder Goyal, chief executive of search and food delivery platform
Zomato
wrote in a post in July on X that its customers would be able to delete orders from their order history. ""Use it responsibly,"" Goyal added to his post on X. He was reacting to a
Zomato
user who posted that he would stop late-night orders because his wife came to know about it.
Rival Swiggy too is scaling up all-night deliveries from select restaurants. The spokesperson for Swiggy said: ""For food delivery too, we're actively working with restaurant and delivery partners to deliver as late as 5 am in many locations across the country.""
Live Events
An executive at a large quick service restaurant chain said the company is in negotiations with ""more than one delivery platform"" for all-night deliveries in select pin codes mainly restricted to office complexes where workforce is required to do night shifts.
""Fresh food orders through the night are rare. But we just want to ensure that if there's demand, we can service it,"" this executive said.
While the
ecommerce platforms
started to experiment with all-night deliveries two years back with pilot projects, the experiment so far was for select pin-codes, which is now being scaled up. ""Wherever we are live, in most areas, we do late
night deliveries
. As we expand and double our store strength, our platform will be available for round the clock deliveries in more regions,"" said a spokesperson for Zepto, which raised close to $1 billion from General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital and Epiq Capital over the past two months.
The surge in quick-commerce orders, riding on convenience of 10-minute deliveries, is also leading to demand on the workforce front.
""We are seeing quick commerce, restaurants and food delivery companies aggressively scaling up estimated growth of 50% from last year owing to a rise in demand and the competitive forces in the market. The rise in demand is led by gradual change in consumer behaviour towards ordering food, groceries and essentials during the nights,"" said Aditya Mishra, chief executive of search firm CIEL HR Services.
Mishra said the trend is especially escalating in crowded cities. ""The workforce is gaining a greater degree of comfort in nighttime working,"" he said. Makers of grocery products and daily essentials such as
Nestle
,
Dabur
,
Hindustan Unilever
, Godrej Consumer and
ITC
have been reporting 25-50% increase in sales on quick commerce platforms.
Sales at ecommerce platforms of these companies have been growing at twice the pace seen in FY24, executives of these companies have said in recent earnings calls.

Reliance expands trading area by 50% for non-food & general merchandise chasing higher margins,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-expands-trading-area-by-50-for-non-food-general-merchandise-chasing-higher-margins/articleshow/113365687.cms,15-09-2024,"New Delhi:
Reliance Retail
, the country's largest retailer, has increased the trading area for non-food and general merchandise by almost 50 per cent in its grocery stores in a bid to improve margins.
The move is also likely to bolster the retailer's hyper-local aspirations through its e-commerce platform
Jiomart
, through which it is connecting its Smart and Smart Bazaar stores providing a wider variety to consumers, according to a senior industry executive.
As part of that
Reliance
Retail is now going for space revision at its stores, allocating higher trading areas for non-food and general merchandise items, a segment which offers higher margins than other segments such as grocery and apparel.
The extended retail space would not only allow Reliance Retail to offer a complete range of products for a segment but also fill in the gaps in its offerings, the source said.
The purpose of big box formats like SmartBazaar is to participate in the total consumption basket of the family.

Different categories have different margins and sales velocities. However both combined, margin per square foot is the true retail measure, the source added.
All categories, from Fresh Produce to Toys & Luggage have a distinct role to play. The category mix design also depends on the context of each store - mall, high street or neighbourhood, apart from economic and ethnic profile of each catchment.
In the latest June quarter, Reliance Retail's EBITDA margin from operations was 8.2 per cent, which was up 30 basis points on a Y-o-Y basis. For FY 2023-24, its EBITDA margin was 8.5 per cent, improving by 70 bps on Y-o-Y.
An e-mail sent to Reliance Retail seeking comments on the development remained unanswered by the time of filing the story.
Besides, it will also help compete with the growing quick-commerce platforms through its ""hyper-local model under Jiomart, where it is investing in enhancements to the technology platform, supply chain capabilities and distribution capabilities.
Reliance Retail, which aims to double its business in the next 3-4 years, is trying to improve its margins. It is enhancing its play in the premium space as it believes that with the increase in disposable income in the country, demand for goods and services is expanding rapidly.
During its latest June quarter earnings calls, Reliance management said it is ""streamlining operations which is driving the margin improvement"".
Even in its latest annual report, Reliance Retail had said focus on range expansion across non-food categories remains a ""key priority"".
Its stores witnessed continued growth in the non-food category led by General Merchandise and Home & Personal Care categories, Reliance Retail has said.
In the AGM, Reliance Retail announced plans to enter the ""luxury jewellery segment"" with a curated, design-led experience and is exploring the fashion jewellery and accessories segment.
As of June 30, 2024, Reliance Retail was operating 18,918 stores spread across the country with a total retail area of 81.3 million sq. ft operated by the company. Reliance Retail opened 1,840 new stores in FY24 and is already among the Top-5 global retailers in terms of number of stores.
Beides, it is among the top 10 global retailers by market cap and among the top 30 by revenues.
Reliance Retail's gross revenue was at Rs 3.06 lakh crore (USD 36.8 billion) for FY24. Its stores witnessed over a billion footfalls and reported more than 1.25 billion transactions across its channels.

"Discounts, offers drive car, electronics sales in Onam, Ganesh Chaturthi",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/discounts-offers-drive-car-electronics-sales-in-onam-ganesh-chaturthi/articleshow/113352542.cms,14-09-2024,"New Delhi/Kolkata: Hefty discounts and promotional offers have helped trigger some uptick in car and consumer electronic sales during the ongoing Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam festivals – which herald the festive season – after sluggish demand so far this year.
Maruti Suzuki
reported a 10% increase in bookings in Kerala ahead of Onam, while on the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi the country’s largest car manufacturer’s deliveries in Maharashtra and Karnataka went up at the same pace, its senior executive officer (marketing and sales) Partho Banerjee said.
Two-wheeler sales continued to grow at over 15-16% pace during Onam while consumer electronics sales in Kerala went up by 7-8% over last year when overall sales had declined, industry executives said.
However, the trend of the premium end of the market driving most of the demand continues across most consumer goods including cars, they said.
Kamal Nandi, business head at refrigerator and washing machine manufacturer Godrej Appliances, said there is not much traction in the mass segment with premium products mostly driving sales during Onam. “Mass segment sales remain need-based, like we saw good demand during summer due to heatwave,” he said.

Nandi said Onam has been better than last year, but the growth rate is not up to expectations.
Industry executives said there was a 15% growth in sales of frost-free refrigerators during Onam while entry level single-door refrigerators sales declined by 6-7%. In washing machines, pricier fully automatic model sales went up by 12-13% while semi-automatic machines sales reported a marginal growth of 4-5%.
Apple started pre-bookings for its latest iPhone 16 series from Friday evening, and customer response in the first 24 hours reflects better demand than last year, industry executives said.
Sales during Onam gives an early demand trend of the festive season that peaks during Diwali.
To be sure, volume sales or the number of units sold during the festive season tends to grow at 12-15% in a good year, while for cars the growth is usually up to 20%.
The auto industry had a high base last year during the festive season. So, the growth rate may remain low but absolute volumes are expected to expand, helping the industry bring down unsold stocks, industry executives said.
“While these are positive indications helping the industry to get over the demand lull in the last few months, festive season growth may seem muted because of the high base of last year,” Banerjee of Maruti said.
Yogesh Mathur, director (sales and marketing) at Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India, expects this festive season to be one of the best for both scooters and motorcycles as the demand that was expected in the rural areas has yet to take off. “Indications so far are positive,” he said.
There is a certain amount of pent-up demand in the market due to weak sales in the first five months of the fiscal because of elections and weather-related disruptions, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) president C S Vigneshwar said. Aided with discounts, this has started spurring car sales during Onam.
Automobile industry volumes this festive period are expected to increase by about 15% over average monthly sales of 330,000 units seen in the first five months of the fiscal year.
Senior industry executives said festive sales may grow in low single-digits on a high base of over a million units last year.
Festive season is the largest consumption period in India and is crucial for some industries like electronics, smartphones and automobiles since up to 30% of their annual sales comes from Onam, Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali.

"What are India's antitrust findings against Amazon, Flipkart?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/what-are-indias-antitrust-findings-against-amazon-flipkart/articleshow/113347753.cms,14-09-2024,"Indian antitrust investigations have found that
Amazon
and
Walmart
's
Flipkart
violated
local competition laws
by giving preference to some sellers, prioritising certain listings, and steeply discounting products, hurting other companies.
Here are the key findings of the
Competition Commission of India
(
CCI
), which are detailed in two reports that are not public but have been reviewed by Reuters.
Amazon, Flipkart and the CCI have not responded to requests for comment about the reports.
* PREFERRED SELLERS: Amazon had six preferred sellers, while Flipkart had 33, who got preferential treatment on their platforms in breach of antitrust laws. The sellers received marketing, warehousing and other services at a ""miniscule cost"".
The CCI also said Amazon and Flipkart used their foreign investments to provide such subsidised rates.

There was an ecosystem at both Amazon and Flipkart ""wherein no seller other than its preferred seller can survive"", the CCI said.
*PREFERENTIAL LISTINGS: The CCI said that the majority of products appearing at the top of Amazon and Flipkart listings were from alleged preferred sellers. This created a barrier for other sellers, the CCI said.
*
EXCLUSIVE PRODUCT LAUNCHES
: Both Amazon and Flipkart had partnerships with smartphone and technology companies to launch their devices exclusively, a move that hurt smaller retailers.
""Exclusive launches had not only severely affected the ordinary sellers on the platform but also the brick-and-mortar retailers who were provided mobile phones at a much later date,"" the CCI reports said.
* DEEP DISCOUNTING: Both Amazon and Flipkart enabled their affiliated and preferred sellers to provide deep discounts, which involved selling much below cost for the purpose of driving out competition, the CCI reports said.

Xiaomi
and other smartphone companies colluded with
Amazon
and Walmart's
Flipkart
to exclusively launch products on the
e-commerce
firms' Indian websites in breach of antitrust laws, according to regulatory reports seen by Reuters.
Antitrust investigations conducted by the
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) have found that Amazon and Flipkart violated local competition laws by giving preference to select sellers, prioritising certain listings, and steeply discounting products, hurting other companies, Reuters reported this week.
The CCI's 1,027-page report on Amazon also said the Indian units of five companies - Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Realme and OnePlus - were ""involved in the practice of exclusive"" phone launches in ""collusion"" with Amazon and its affiliates, breaking competition law.
In Flipkart's case, a 1,696-page CCI report said the Indian units of Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo, Lenovo and Realme conducted similar practices.
The inclusion of smartphone makers like Samsung and Xiaomi in the case could increase their legal and compliance headaches.

""Exclusivity in business is anathema. Not only is it against free and fair competition but also against the interest of consumers,"" CCI's additional director general G.V. Siva Prasad wrote in the Amazon and Flipkart reports, in identical findings.
Reuters is first to report the smartphone companies have been accused of anticompetitive behavior in the CCI's reports which are dated Aug. 9 and are not public.
Xiaomi declined to comment, while the other smartphone makers did not respond to requests for comment.
Amazon, Flipkart and the CCI did not respond, and have not so far commented on the reports' findings.
Both the CCI reports said that during investigations Amazon and Flipkart ""deliberately downplayed"" allegations of exclusive launches, but officials found the practice was ""rampant"".
Counterpoint Research data shows that South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi are two of India's biggest smartphone players, together holding an almost 36% market share, with China's Vivo on 19%.
India's e-retail market is set to exceed $160 billion by 2028, up from $57-60 billion in 2023, consultancy firm Bain estimates.
The investigation findings are a major setback for Amazon and Flipkart in a key growth market where they have faced the ire of small retailers for years for hurting their offline businesses.
The CCI has also said both companies used their foreign investments to provide subsidised rates for services like warehousing and marketing to a select number of sellers.
ONLINE SALES BOOM
Some of the smartphone companies - Xiaomi, Samsung, OnePlus, Realme and Motorola - have been ordered to submit their financial statements for three fiscal years to 2024, certified by their auditor, to the CCI, according to an internal CCI document dated Aug. 28, also seen by Reuters.
The investigation into Amazon, Flipkart and their sellers was triggered in 2020 by a complaint from an affiliate of the country's biggest retailer association, the Confederation of All India Traders, which has 80 million members.
The CCI will in coming weeks review any objections to its findings from Amazon, Flipkart, the retailer association, and the smartphone companies, and could potentially impose fines along with mandating companies to change their business practices, people familiar with the matter said.
Indian retailers have repeatedly accused Amazon and Flipkart, and smartphone companies, of exclusive phone launches online, saying shopkeepers suffered as they didn't get the latest models and customers looked for them on the shopping websites.
""Exclusive launches had not only severely affected the ordinary sellers on the platform but also the brick-and-mortar retailers who were provided mobile phones at a much later date,"" both CCI reports said, citing analyses of data from smartphone companies.
Indian research firm Datum Intelligence estimates that 50% of phone sales were online last year, up from 14.5% in 2013. Flipkart had a 55% share in online phone sales in 2023, and Amazon 35%.

Final CCI order on Amazon & Flipkart likely by November,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/final-cci-order-on-amazon-flipkart-likely-by-november/articleshow/113334027.cms,14-09-2024,"The
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) will likely issue final orders by November on its four-year-long investigation into alleged
anti-competitive practices
by
ecommerce giants
Amazon and Walmart-backed
Flipkart
, said people aware of the development.
The probe by the CCI's investigation wing, headed by director general Ansuman Pattnaik, has now corroborated the charge that the two companies have indulged in antitrust activities by extending
preferential treatments
to select sellers on their platforms, the people said.
""The platforms'
deep discounting
through preferred sellers is distorting competition and the anti-competitive practices have been noticed across most product categories,"" one of the persons told ET.
The regulator's final orders, usually firmed up after due deliberations over the DG's probe reports and responses by aggrieved parties, are expected to largely reflect this position, the people said.
The DG's separate probe reports for
Amazon
and Flipkart, finalised in August, came in the build-up to next month's Diwali when both the firms host mega sales on their online platforms.

""The DG's findings have been sent to the ecommerce companies for their responses. After comprehensive deliberations on the findings and the responses of the parties, the regulator will arrive at the final decision. It should come by November,"" a second person said.

Quick commerce
companies are, for the first time, collaborating with fast-moving consumer goods (
FMCG
) companies such as Parle, Mondelez and ITC on offers, special packs and promotional banners for this festive season, executives said.
The focus will be on categories such as chocolates, packaged Indian sweets, confectionery, dry fruits and cookies, said the people cited above.
The platforms have also forged alliances with consumer electronics companies for the likes of kitchen appliances, small personal care electronic products, smartwatches and earbuds.
Amid their fast-increasing popularity and widening range of products, speed delivery platforms are looking to push up inventory levels by as much as 60% this time, from last year’s festive season.
Executives have been meeting brands to finalise plans and grab a larger share of the festive gifting market, typically the mainstay of large retail chains and big local stores, the people said.
Live Events
“Quick commerce companies want some hand-holding from the large FMCG companies for the festive season, in terms of promotion support or special packs,” said Krishnarao Buddha, senior category head at biscuits major Parle Products. “They want to give strong competition this Diwali, (to what was) till last year… limited (to) ecommerce platforms and modern retail.”
Parle will be selling large confectionery packs and festive packs of cookies through quick commerce for the first time this Diwali.
Mondelez India has partnered with leading quick commerce companies, especially for gifting, said the confectionary maker’s vice-president of sales, Desmond D’souza. “This includes strong on-app and off-app collaborations, including on digital and out-of-home, apart from building significant visibility on the platform,” he said.
The company will target “premium shoppers” with Silk and Bournville branded gifting packs, besides Cadbury Celebrations.
The Diwali promotions come as quick commerce has become the fastest growing channel for consumer goods manufacturers, helping to increase their overall ecommerce business growth rates and contribution. Quick commerce accounts for 30-40% of their online sales.
These 10-30-minute delivery companies are also rapidly expanding their portfolio and taking rapid and scheduled deliveries to newer locations.
Most quick commerce companies had plans to scale up rapidly into high-value electronic products such as smartphones and television sets, as well as fashion, by the festive season, but those partnerships are still being negotiated, which is why the platforms have decided to turn their focus toward festive purchases and gifting, said the people cited earlier.
Consumers are looking at quick commerce for gifting purposes across foods and personal care categories, an ITC spokesperson said. “ITC has lined up a slew of festive gift packs across categories for launch on different channels, including quick commerce. We expect sales from quick commerce to go up significantly this season,” the person said.
A senior executive at a large electronics brand with a strong presence in kitchen appliances and grooming items said the company will expand its presence in quick commerce this Diwali for the first time. “Consumer preference has shifted to quick commerce in large cities,” he said.

Mukesh Ambani

Manoj Modi

Tira
a few months ago. In her early 30s, she has worked closely with Isha Ambani, who is on the board of
Reliance Retail
Ventures and drives the group's various retail formats. She's also being mentored by V Subramaniam, managing director at Reliance Retail. Her father is among

Bhakti Modi has been handling strategy and execution as part of the leadership team at Reliance Retail as a cofounder since its official launch by Isha Ambani in April 2023. She was involved in strategy and new business initiatives for a while at Reliance Retail.
""It's a natural progression into the role and seamless and, therefore, not surprising. She's extremely hands on in terms of execution and driving Tira's growth with the leadership team including Isha Ambani,"" said an executive close to the matter. Reliance didn't comment.
In August 2022, Modi was also inducted as a director at Reliance Brands and drew an annual remuneration of ₹5 crore in FY24.
""Her role is not just restricted to Tira since she is involved with shaping the entire beauty and fashion division that includes partnerships with Sephora and Kiko Milano. She is also involved in key strategic decisions such as bringing premium international brands into India and creating own labels,"" said an executive.

Tira competes with Nykaa, Tata Cliq Palette, Myntra and others in the market for beauty products. Apart from online, Tira has also opened a dozen offline stores in top cities.
Nykaa
is the biggest beauty retailer with sales of ₹6,386 crore in FY24 and has a portfolio of over 3,600 beauty and personal care brands and a dozen own labels.
Tira recently launched private labels: Tira Tools is a line of beauty accessories, Nails Our Way offers premium nail colour and care products, and Akind is a skincare brand cofounded by Mira Kapoor.
Pakhi Saxena, retail and consumer product goods head at Wazir Advisors, said the segment allows varying formats, propositions and players to coexist. ""The Indian BPC (beauty and personal care) market is being driven by high levels of adoption and penetration,"" she said. ""The segment is witnessing proliferation of categories and products owing to addressal of multiple needs and concerns. On the supply levers, interesting innovations, robust ingredients and discerning attributes are finding increasing investments by brands and retailers.""
According to a Redseer report, India's beauty and personal care market will expand the fastest among comparable countries in size, with the compounded growth rate projected at 10% between 2022 and 2027, which will take it to $30 billion from $19 billion now. India, which will account for nearly 5% of the global growth opportunity, has per capita spending of $14 in this category compared with the US where it is $313 and China, where the per capita spending is $38.
""Fashion and beauty are important growth drivers for the retail businesses of Reliance,"" an executive said.
Bhakti Modi is also a fashion designer and specialises in merchandising and buying in the beauty space, insiders said. She started her career as a trainee with Reliance Brands. Since 2012, she has had various roles at Reliance Brands, its ecommerce site Ajio, Reliance Retail and Tira.
""These are comparatively early days yet for Bhakti's role in a leadership position and how she builds Tira remains to be seen. She is focused on execution and is close to Isha Ambani. She is enterprising and seen as the right person to be a leader,"" said another official close to the group.
She's also on the boards of Tally Solutions and Thoughtful Advisors, a real estate company incorporated in 2022. Bhakti Modi is married to Tejas Goenka, the managing director of Tally Solutions, an accounting software maker.

Asked about the pipeline of the new stores for the second phase, Pulverer said:""We are in the finalisation"".
Pulverer also pointed out that land in India is ""valuable and very expensive"" and interest rates are also higher, which make it more challenging.
""At the same time, being a low-cost company and really cost-conscious, we try to find ways to work around and compensate. We look at, together with our colleagues in sourcing, how to have more of local source products that will help gross margins,"" she said.
In 2013, the government approved a Rs 10,500 crore FDI proposal by Ikea to set up 10 stores with allied infrastructure in 10 years.

Ikea has plans to expand its operations to other parts of the country in a phased manner.
Pulverer said Ikea has decided to focus on six markets - Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi,
Chennai
and Pune.
""We are planning to penetrate the adjacent cities. We can not spread all over India in one go, because you need to have the logistics set-up behind it. We are taking step by step,"" she added.
In the second phase, Ikea's next big market will be Delhi, where it will also look at the adjacent areas with smaller formats.
""Of course, we are looking at in the vicinity of Delhi-NCR and cities like Chandigarh as to how could we reach there...a bit smaller formats, which is easier to invest in,"" she said.
Delhi will be the next big market to open in the beginning of 2025. It's coming closer with the CDC (customer distribution centre) first, and then the company is looking at smaller store formats, she added.

"Carrefour to re-enter India, signs franchise partnership with Apparel Group",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/carrefour-to-re-enter-india-signs-franchise-partnership-with-apparel-group/articleshow/113189531.cms,10-09-2024,"France’s
Carrefour
will re-enter the Indian market after a decade as a “retailer” through a franchise agreement with Dubai-based
Apparel Group
, which sells brands such as Victoria’s Secret, Charles & Keith, Aldo, and Bath & Body Works in
India
.
Carrefour, one of the world’s top food retailers, exited India in 2014 after four years of operations as a wholesaler after finding it difficult to scale up and make profits. The company was prohibited from selling directly to consumers under India’s restrictive laws on retail, framed to protect small Kirana or neighbourhood stores.
Carrefour’s second avatar in India will be through the retail format with store sizes of 8,000-30,000 sq ft.
The company will initially focus on North India, eventually expanding its presence nationwide. The first store is planned to open in NCR in 2025.
“We will be expanding with multiple formats across the country to adapt to the country’s retail landscape. India is now the cornerstone of the Carrefour International Partnership 2026 development plan, marking a significant step forward in our strategy to expand into over 10 new countries by 2026,” said Patrick Lasfargues, Carrefour's Executive Director of International Partnership in a press statement.
Live Events
Carrefour did not specify if it will sell food only or other products as well.
India allows 100% foreign direct investment in food retail if the food item is sourced and made locally.
Food and grocery has the largest share in the retail market, according to Pakhi Saxena, Retail CPG Head,
Wazir Advisors, a consulting firm.
“In a very dynamic and rapidly changing market for food retail, we plan to open our first Carrefour stores during the summer of 2025,” said Nilesh Ved, owner of Apparel Group and chairman of AppCorp Holding.
Founded in 1996, Apparel Group manages a portfolio of 85 brands, operating over 2,300 stores across 14 countries in the Middle East, India, Southeast Asia and Africa.
In India, the company has a network of over 250 stores across more than 35 cities and 15 states.
Carrefour Group, with a multi-format network of over 14,000 stores in more than 40 countries, is one of the world's leading food retailers.

“We have seen a lot of pure e-com brands that are going into physical spaces. Some items are more convenient to buy online. But if I want some inspiration then I will go to a meeting place and it's just to create sense of belonging,” the executive said.
Spread over 1.7 million sq ft, Gurugram’s retail destination will have the country’s first IngkaCentre, which the company aims to make operational by 2026, while Noida is expected to be operational by 2028.
Ingka Group received the Indian government’s approval to invest Rs 10,500 crore in the country to open big-box stores in 2013. The proposed
investment
was part of that, but the company is open to increase the investment amount.
“Investments that is approved is up and running. We are scanning the market for opportunities and we have more appetite for India for sure,” said Hylving.
On the plan for more Ingka centres in the country, Hylving said that Ikea sets the pace for expansion.
“We will only do a meeting place when Ikea joins,” said Hylving.
The company has set internal revenue target for both the centres and low rentals is not an issue.
“We have done our homework before we said yes to the investments. We are well aware about the rental conditions in the market and as in any market, meeting places that are successful, are able to deliver more footfall and then that makes the tenants to be able to sell more. Then you have a better opportunity to share the profit together and with up to 25 million visitors that we envision for Noida, which I feel quite comfortable with,” said Hylving.
The company is looking at an international brand for running the hotel.
The centre will follow sustainable construction techniques, using sustainably sourced materials with less carbon emissions. The company aims for 100 percent water recycling, and zero waste to landfill.
“Direct connection to 2 metro stations and 4500 parking slots with more than 70 EV charging stations will encourage sustainable mobility. We have a supplier code of conduct for contractors as well,” the executive said.
Ingka centres are present in 13 markets, with 35 large scale meeting places and around 2000 brands operational in the center.
The Swedish retailer had entered India in 2018 by opening a store in Hyderabad and has since seen revenue surge ahead of rivals.
The expected annual footfall at Gurugram centre is 20 million and 25 million at Noida.
Ikea is present online in Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Gujarat, Bengaluru, and 62 more markets around these regions. Three big format IKEA stores are operational in Hyderabad, Navi Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and one city store in Mumbai.

App-first Gen Z scripting big shifts in consumption trends: Bernstein report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/app-first-gen-z-scripting-big-shifts-in-consumption-trends-bernstein-report/articleshow/113165875.cms,08-09-2024,"The digitally-native, app-first
Gen Z
cohort is assuming the centre stage in India's consumer markets by scripting ""big shifts"" in
consumption trends
, including the rise of
quick commerce
delivery and direct-to-consumer brands, according to a report by Bernstein. Brands are seeking a deeper connection with this digitally-native, app-first generation that 'swipes up' for practically everything from
social media
to ride-hailing and food delivery.
Indian Gen Zs' are the world's largest, the report said about the cohort born into a digital age, that shops, works and eats online. Gen Z is the generation born between 1996 and 2010.
Indian Gen Zs make up 20 per cent of the world and about 27 per cent of India's population, it noted.
Gen Zs have become the ""Swipe Up"" generation considering the amount of time they spend on social media. They swipe up for practically everything - social media, ride-hailing, and food delivery, according to Bernstein's report on 'India Internet'.
Gen Zs are showing a preference for
digital-first
, new-age brands, it observed.
Live Events
""We see big shifts in consumption trends dominated by GenZs...scale up of short-form content (Instagram, Youtube shorts)...preference for quick commerce delivery, 15-20 minutes (Blinkit, Zepto)... the emergence of D2C brands...discovering new food choices through food delivery apps (
Zomato
, Swiggy),"" the report said, adding this has led to brands building deeper connections with GenZs.
Gen Zs have significant headroom in consumption, contributing to about 17 per cent of India's total consumption.
""GenZ has been not only a 'mobile-first' generation but also an app-first 'Swipe Up' generation. Time on smartphones has gone up 60 per cent,"" according to Bernstein.
Gen Z behaviour has helped scale up internet use cases driving monthly or daily active users (MAU/DAU) growth across app ecosystems.
""D2C brands are scaling faster versus traditional FMCG (3-4 years vs 10 years) led by the buying power of Gen Z customers. They have been able to target Gen Z customers through social media,"" the report said.
India is the world's largest footprint for Meta across their app universe (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, FB messenger), it said, adding that quick commerce platforms like Blinkit and Zepto are enabling digital-first brands to reach GenZ customers, rapidly driving growth.
These broad trends are seen benefiting certain companies, which are digital-first and focus on large consumption areas.
The report highlighted that consumption behaviour, preferences and adoption differ between the three primary consumer cohorts 'Gen Zs, Millennials and Gen X.
""GenZ prefer categories which are app-first digitally-native and prefer categories like quick commerce, food delivery, short-form videos, EdTech, athleisure, co-living, new age D2C brands,"" the report observed.
This is very different from 'millennials' who prefer e-commerce, multiplexes, OTT, casual wear, and renting; and 'Gen X' who veers towards offline retail, malls, kiranas, office wear, Bollywood movies, buying houses/ real estate, or the baby 'boomer generation', which goes for kiranas, home food, traditional wear and are more inclined towards savings.
D2C brands are differentiating through specialised customer need identification, marketing, technology and operations. At the same time, multiple untapped niche categories with white space have presented a unique opportunity for D2C brands to thrive in India, as per Bernstein's report.

Retail business closure to focus on core cigarette biz: GPI Chairperson Bina Modi,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-business-closure-to-focus-on-core-cigarette-biz-gpi-chairperson-bina-modi/articleshow/113135667.cms,06-09-2024,"Cigarette maker
Godfrey Phillips India Ltd
Chairperson,
Bina Modi
on Friday defended the company's decision to close its retail business '24Seven', the brainchild of her estranged son Samir Modi, saying it was done with a view to focus on its core business. At the annual general meeting of the company held on Friday, the special business of not filling up the vacancy 'for the time being' caused by retirement by rotation of
Samir Modi
was taken up along with the appointment of his sister
Charu Modi
as an executive director, among others for shareholders' approval.
In her address to the shareholders, Bina Modi said, ""this focus on our core business is in consonance with the 'Theory of Core Competency' propagated by the late global management guru Professor CK Prahalad. This strategy has also led us to the closure of our retail business 24Seven. At times we need to bite the bullet in the long-term interest of the company and shareholders.""
In July this year, Godfrey Phillips India (GPI) had announced that it was going ahead with plans to exit from retail business operated under '24Seven' brand following the setting aside of an interim injunction on the move by a district court in the Capital.
Earlier, an injunction order was passed against hiving off the retail business on June 27, 2024 by a city court here over an application filed by its executive director Samir Modi. The injunction order was then set aside by the District Judge of South-East District at Saket Court, New Delhi in favour of the company.
The company's board had on April 12, 2024, approved exiting from carrying out the retail business division operated under 24Seven, subject to completion of the necessary formalities.
Live Events
Bina Modi has been involved in a boardroom tussle with her son Samir Modi, who had even accused her of orchestrating an attack on him during the company's board meeting.
He had filed a complaint before the Delhi Police alleging that he was stopped from participating in the board meeting of GPI scheduled on May 30 by Bina Modi's PSO and was ""grievously injured"" after being assaulted.
The AGM on Friday also took up the special resolution of re-appointment of Bina Modi as Managing Director and payment of remuneration to her. As her remuneration exceeds the limits of Rs 5 crore or 2.5 per cent of the net profits of the company, GPI requires a special resolution, which has to be passed from a super majority of 75 per cent of the total votes polled.
Last month, US-based proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis had advised the shareholders to vote ""against"" the special resolution seeking her reappointment as
MD
observing that there were ""no defined performance conditions for the payment of commission"".
Godfrey Phillips India is the flagship company of Modi Enterprises. It makes popular cigarette brands like Four Square, Red and White, Cavanders, Tipper and North Pole.
It also manufactures and distributes brand Marlboro under a license agreement with Philip Morris.

""The more these become easier from the regulatory compliance perspective for small businesses, especially for e-commerce exports which is a very unique need, the better off small businesses will be,” Wakankar added.

has reignited ahead of festivity.
Nearly 158,000 electronics and mobile phone retailers have jointly written to top manufacturers, saying several prominent brands are favouring
ecommerce
channels over
offline retail
. The retailers fear these brands will offer heavy discounts online during the
festive season
, which could dent the former's business by up to half.
The All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) specifically mentioned in letters to Samsung, Poco, Motorola, Realme, OnePlus and Iqoo that they were favouring the online channel.
Retailers, including large regional chains, have combined annual revenues of more than Rs 70,000 crore.

A OnePlus India spokesperson said both online and physical channels were equally crucial to its business aspirations in India, and said it would support both this festive season. The other brands cited in the story didn't respond to ET's queries.
Smartphones and consumer electronics are the largest sales contributors during festivity, a season that accounts for up to 30% of annual sales for brands.
Call for Same Schemes
With
demand
in these categories slowing this year, both offline retailers and ecommerce firms are relying heavily on a festive boost. This has rekindled their battle after nearly four to five years. Offline retail tends to lag online discounts due to higher overheads.
AIMRA founder-chairman Kailash Lakhyani said retailers are seeking transparency in operations and a level playing field. ""We are engaged with smartphone companies, and are sharing our concerns with
commerce
minister Piyush Goyal, the consumer affairs ministry and the Competition Commission of India,"" he said.
The Association of Consumer Electronics and Home Appliances Traders, comprising 40
retail chains
including Viveks, Great Eastern Retail, Girias, Pai Electronics and Digi1 Electronics, wrote to LG, Samsung,
Whirlpool
, Godrej, Apple and
Panasonic
last month, asking them to ensure products are not sold at ""ridiculous or predatory prices"" in online marketplaces and the brands' online stores. They also demanded the same cashbacks and EMI schemes across channels. ""Even during the recent Independence Day sales, there were some instances of steep discounting. We are also going to write to the brands separately to ensure quick commerce platforms do not disrupt with steep discounting,"" said association president Raj Kumar Pai. The body's members have a combined
revenue
of Rs 25,000 crore.
The South India Organised Retailers Association too has taken up the issue with the brands. It includes 21 mobile phone retail chains in the south such as Poorvika, Sangeetha Mobiles, BigC Mobiles and SS Mobile, with 5,000 stores and combined revenue of Rs 15,000 crore.

Rising trend of new-age consumer brands attracting VC investors in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/rising-trend-of-new-age-consumer-brands-attracting-vc-investors-in-india/articleshow/112996790.cms,02-09-2024,"India's
new-age
consumer
brands
are drawing significant interest from venture capital investors as they successfully tap into evolving
consumer
demands and identify market gaps that traditional companies have yet to address, reported TOI. Brands like the five-year-old luggage maker Mokobara, young fashion label Snitch, and older players such as Sugar Cosmetics and Boat, are catering to the tastes of Gen Z and millennials, while also localizing their offerings to suit local nuances. Since 2014, these emerging companies have collectively secured over $5 billion in funding, with $400 million raised so far in 2024 alone, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.
These new-age direct-to-consumer brands have been able to capture the preferences of a growing consumer base willing to spend on premium products that go beyond average offerings. ""The big brands which existed were averaging people's requirements. Consumers are demanding more; they want more than average and are willing to pay a premium for that. There is now a fairly large chunk of people who have a reasonable amount of discretionary income,"" explained V S Kannan Sitaram, co-founder and partner at Fireside Ventures.
Fireside Ventures recently invested in Gurgaon-based Moxie Beauty, a company that produces haircare products tailored for Indian hair types, habits, and weather conditions—a niche largely unmet by global brands.
Several other new-age brands like Mokobara, Sid's Farm, Foxtale, Bummer, and ICON have also secured funding from investors this year. Last month,
Accel
led a $9 million funding round for the luggage brand Uppercase.
Analysts from Bain & Company refer to these new entrants as ""insurgent"" brands, which have seen higher adoption rates among Gen Z consumers who favor digital-first brands. ""The increase in India's income and consumption has led to the rise of insurgent brands—young, new brands that cater to the underserved needs of the emerging affluent consumer class. These brands are already growing faster than their respective categories—by approximately three times,"" said Hariharan Premkumar, managing director and head of India at DSG Consumer Partners, which has funded new-age companies like Farmley, Go Desi, and SuperBottoms.
Live Events
Premkumar emphasized the potential for these brands to capitalize on premiumization and new category creation: ""The premium segment is underserved and offers a good beachhead for insurgent brands to build from there."" He noted that estimates suggest premiumization and new category creation will account for about 50% of overall consumption growth by 2030.
With the rise of quick commerce platforms, these brands are also able to reach consumers more rapidly, further fueling their growth, said Maanav Sagar, partner at Bharat Founders Fund.
India's evolving consumer landscape has provided fertile ground for these new-age brands to flourish, meeting the growing demands for specialized, premium products and paving the way for continued success and expansion in the coming years.

"Etail, logistics companies prepare package for non-metro boom",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/etail-logistics-companies-prepare-package-for-non-metro-boom/articleshow/112934438.cms,31-08-2024,"NEW DELHI: Ecommerce and logistics companies have stepped up expansion into smaller cities this festive season, with increased hiring and focused marketing programmes, as these markets grow faster than metros, said industry executives.
Driven by rapid urbanisation, mushrooming of shopping malls and surge in spending, tier II-III towns have seen a significant increase in manpower demand, said
Yeshab Giri
, chief commercial officer, operational talent solutions, at
Randstad India
, a talent management company. Cities such as Jaipur, Indore, Ahmedabad, Coimbatore, Lucknow, Vadodara, Surat, Bhubaneswar, Bhopal, Chandigarh and Vizag are witnessing 25-30% more demand than the previous festive season, he said.
""Currently, ecommerce and logistics firms in tier II-III cities are hiring approximately 65% of the overall talent,"" said
Lohit Bhatia
, president, workforce management, at
Quess Corp
. Metros and other tier I cities traditionally see a greater spurt in festive demand, he said.
Some companies are also running apprenticeship programmes ranging between six to 36 months in certain smaller cities, Bhatia said. ""These 'Learn and Earn' programmes are also doing extremely well. Employees also learn on the job at the ecommerce and logistics companies, especially warehouse executives,"" he said.
Companies are mainly hiring pickers and packers, warehouse inventory staff who manage stock levels and delivery personnel, according to industry executives.
Live Events
Logistics firm
Ekart
, for instance, is expanding beyond the metros, with a network of 50 million cubic feet of warehousing space, a 7,000-truck fleet and a last-mile reach to 15,000 pin codes.
""Ekart is building the supply chain for India and carries the mission of democratising ecommerce for all brands,"" said
Mani Bhushan
, chief business officer at Ekart. ""Ekart is well-established and will continue to deepen presence in tier II-III supply chains and beyond."" These include last-mile delivery and bulk cargo pickups from brands and manufacturers.
Online Transactions Growing
“Building a supply chain that covers all towns and cities is critical to enabling commerce, and that is a core capability that we will continue to develop,” said Bhushan of Ekart.
Hyderabad-based logistics company Gati is hiring 30% of its workforce for tier II-III markets, its spokesperson told ET.
Earlier this week,
Zomato
CFO Akshant Goyal said about Blinkit, “We are in about 26 cities today and seeing this business (quick commerce) growing in some of the smaller cities where we’ve launched as well. Slowly and steadily, we want to expand and get into more cities.”
Ecommerce platform
Meesho
in an August 8 report said online commerce adoption has surged in tier IV+ cities. “Users from tier IV+ cities have emerged as the most frequent repeat shoppers in ecommerce across categories such as women’s fashion, footwear and baby care,” it said. The platform said it has 80% of its 150 million annual transacting customers coming from tier II cities and beyond, such as Bhilai, Imphal, Jalandhar, Jhunjhunu and Nellore.

Raymond Lifestyle plans 900 stores in 3 years: Gautam Singhania,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/raymond-lifestyle-plans-900-stores-in-3-years-gautam-singhania/articleshow/112904608.cms,29-08-2024,"Raymond Lifestyle plans
to add 900 stores over the next three years, targeting 12-15% annual
sales growth
and 18-20%
operating profit growth
, according to chairman
Gautam Singhania
. Shares of Raymond Lifestyle, the
demerged unit
of Raymond, are set to list on the bourses on September 5.
Singhania told ET that internal challenges in China and Bangladesh, coupled with trade agreements with the UK,
European Union
, and Australia, present significant opportunities for the company.
""The demerger aims to unlock
shareholder value
by creating a focused lifestyle business entity, allowing investors to concentrate on this specific theme. The standalone entity will sharpen strategic focus on the lifestyle segment, driven by a professional management team,"" Singhania said.
Last year, Raymond sold its FMCG business to Godrej Consumer for ₹2,825 crore, and later announced the demerger of its lifestyle and real estate businesses, while retaining the engineering segment within the existing listed entity after acquiring Maini Precision.
Singhania noted that the combined entity didn't achieve the expected valuations as sector-specific funds weren't interested in diversified businesses. Now, with three separately listed companies, each will unlock shareholder value through focused professional management, net cash positions, and optimised costs and working capital.

The company is expanding its big-box Reliance Digital format apart from a “new productivity-focused format for the latest mobiles and laptops,” said Ms Ambani. ET had broken about this expansion into a new format in October 2022.
Ms Ambani said Reliance’s investments in brands like Kalanikethan, Zivame, Clovia, Amante and Urban Ladder have given it a strong foothold in these categories. She said Reliance’s own brands like Avaasa, Netplay and DNMX each surpassed the Rs 2,000 crore annual sales milestone in FY24, while John Players and Teamspirit crossed Rs 1,000 crore in sales.
In grocery retail, Ms Ambani said Reliance is expanding at 2.5 times the rest of modern trade driven by focus on smaller towns where over two-thirds of the new stores are opening. “In many of these markets, we are the first modern retailer to establish a presence. At the same time, we are selectively expanding our premium formats, Fresh Signature and Freshpik, in large cities,” she said.
Ms Ambani said in beauty, Reliance is building presence through an omni-channel strategy across multiple formats like Tira, Sephora, Kiko Milano and Blushlace, while enhancing beauty and personal care offerings across existing formats such as grocery, fashion and pharma both online and offline.
“Our investment in Insight Cosmetics is enabling us to create our own brand portfolio,” she said.
In the FMCG business, Ms Ambani said the early success of its brands like Campa, Lotus Chocolates and Sosyo gives Reliance the “confidence that we are on the right path.” She said Reliance has built a robust pan-India supply chain through its own facilities and strategic partnerships to offer products at highly competitive prices. The R&D facility in Bengaluru is able to quickly develop world-class food products.

Reliance Retail
granted
employee stock option plans
(
ESOPs
) worth Rs 351 crore to 15 senior executives in the last financial year, showed the company’s filing to the Registrar of Companies (RoC).
The retail business of

RIL

Reliance Retail has gave ESOPs to chief operating officer for grocery retail and Jiomart Kamadeba Mohanty, head of strategy and projects Prateek Mathur, Reliance Trends chief operating officer Vipin Tyagi and chief operating officer of the FMCG business Ketan Mody.
Reliance Retail didn’t respond to ET’s email queries.
Mohit Yadav, founder of business intelligence firm AltInfo said Reliance Retail's ESOP allotment at Rs 796.50 per share represents a significant 7865% premium to the share’s face value.
“The substantial ESOP pool of 490 million shares, approved back in 2007, indicates long-term planning for employee incentivisation. With allotments to 15 key executives, including a top grant of 763,000 shares to a senior executive, Reliance appears to be strategically reinforcing its leadership team. This move aligns with the trend of using ESOPs to retain top talent, especially crucial as the company potentially prepares for an IPO,” he said.
Reliance Retail is the country’s largest retailer by store count, profit and sales across categories such as food and grocery, consumer electronics and smartphones, apparel and business-to-business wholesale.
The company posted over 15% rise in
revenue

"Beyond kirana, e-commerce is winning another front. Here's what can happen",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/beyond-kirana-e-commerce-is-winning-another-front-heres-what-can-happen/articleshow/112803109.cms,26-08-2024,"Touch-and-feel retail, where customers like to experience the product before buying it, is now yielding to e-commerce. The phenomenal rise of e-commerce in India had failed to make any big dent in the touch-and-feel
retail
in the white goods sector because customers won't buy a high-value good without physically experiencing it. But that's changing now. ET has reported that sales of high-value items such as washing machines, air-conditioners and laptops grew significantly faster online than in brick-and-mortar stores in the January-June period of this year.
As per GfK-NielsenIQ data, AC sales online increased 62% in value against 30% offline in the first half of 2024, compared with a year earlier. Washing machine sales rose 15% online on-year when in offline the growth was flat, while in laptops, sales increased 7% online but fell 3% offline. For tablets, purchases online doubled in value against 18% growth at physical stores. Industry executives said the difference in sales growth between online and offline for these electronic products was never so wide — it used to be 4-6 percentage points higher online, except during the Covid period when offline stores were shut.
Last frontier for e-commerce?
The new trend has far-reaching implications for India's retail sector. E-commerce has come in spotlight recently after Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal raised concerns last week over the rapid expansion of e-commerce firms in India, describing it as a ""matter of concern"" rather than an achievement. He flagged the potential disruptions that could be caused for small retailers across the country who also serve the market. The minister also expressed concern over the imbalance between small traders and large retailers, highlighting the decline of small mobile stores.
The GfK-NielsenIQ data indicates that after
kirana
stores, high-value retail is also succumbing to e-commerce. “Gone are the days when online was only the channel for entry-level products,” said Anant Jain, head of customer success (tech and durables) at GfK India, a NielsenIQ company. A lot of people are researching offline and going online for purchases for a good deal and convenience, he said. “Also, the average selling price for categories like AC, washing machine and laptop are relatively higher than others. This has pulled up overall sales value growth in the online channel.”
A new consumer habit is hardening
Retail industry is greatly influenced by consumer habits. GfK-NielsenIQ data shows that consumers are now willing to go online to buy high-value goods, breaking a big behavioural barrier. Besides attractive prices online, the acceptance of high-value online shopping, especially among the youth, indicates the retail landscape in India might witness major shifts.
Live Events
The new trend shows that a consumer habit is hardening to become a stable behaviour. The rise of quick commerce in India is seen to be due to consumers trying to avoid travel, effort and time spent on physically buying groceries, snacks and other entry-level goods. When time is money, especially in urban areas, people are willing to pay a little more to save on it. When quick commerce gained shape in India during the Covid pandemic, a large section of the industry had written it off. Their argument was that Indian consumers were not going to pay convenience fees, no matter what. Some even insisted that consumers would happily wait for a few hours or even a day, if that meant they would get their orders delivered free. Today, one after the other, leading FMCG companies in their 2023-24 earnings report state that quick commerce is now not just their fastest growing channel, it is what is driving their e-commerce business growth itself, ET has reported.
The GfK-NielsenIQ data indicates that the habit that has spawned quick commerce will now define retail in India. If customers are not averse to buying high-value goods online, they will not resist the temptation to buy them from quick commerce companies, which are now game to try the new format.
Quick-commerce operators such as Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto are already aggressively trying to lure away consumers from large
ecommerce
platforms like Amazon and Flipkart by matching their prices across groceries and fast-selling general merchandise, ET has reported recently, triggering a price war in the home delivery space.
Soon this price war can engulf high-value goods too. Quick commerce model requires multiple dark stores to be set up in close vicinity in each market, while e-commerce players mostly make deliveries from centralised warehouses. Yet, quick commerce players such Swiggy Instamart,
Zomato
’s Blinkit, BigBasket’s BBNow and Zepto plan to expand their services to electronic products and white goods categories by Diwali, delivering within 10-45 minutes, industry executives told ET in June.
Brands are open to partnerships with these platforms, encouraged by the success of the model in FMCG, they said. It’s a huge opportunity in the kitchen and small appliances segment, apart from handsets, television sets and microwave ovens, where e-commerce accounts for 35-45% of sales, according to the executives. Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart have already started delivering air coolers that are priced upwards of Rs 5,000 in addition to other high-ticket products.
The high-value purchases shifting from brick-and-mortal stores to online would eventually mean quick commerce gobbling up this category too after FMCG, groceries and electronics, even though experts have said it would not be easy for quick commerce companies to morph into full-service companies due to logistical issues. But if white goods brands are open to partner with quick commerce companies, that would mean quick commerce players will be able to fight a new price war with e-commerce companies.
While logistics, warehousing and pricing will impact this possible shift from brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce to quick commerce, the consumer behaviour will be the key. If consumer wants a refrigerator or a washing machine delivered in 20 minutes flat, there will be many to oblige. It could be a worrying prospect for white goods retailers after small kirana stores which are already facing the heat from quick commerce.

Quick-commerce vs e-commerce: Ready for the new pricefight in town?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-vs-e-commerce-ready-for-the-new-pricefight-in-town/articleshow/112748617.cms,24-08-2024,"Quick-commerce operators such as Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto are aggressively trying to lure away consumers from large
ecommerce

in the home

space.
This is a departure from the earlier
pricing
strategy of quick-commerce players who typically charged 10-15% premium over average ecommerce marketplace prices for instant deliveries, industry executives said.
The strategy now is to win consumers from large ecommerce at a time when urban shoppers increasingly prefer faster and scheduled deliveries, they said.
An ET study of prices of 30 commonly used products in daily necessities, discretionary groceries and other categories, including electronics and toys, in both ecommerce and quick-commerce platforms reveal the pricing disparity has been bridged. ""The pricing premium which
quick commerce
used to charge for instant deliveries is gone with these platforms now joining a race with large ecommerce to offer competitive pricing to shift consumer loyalties,"" said B Krishna Rao, senior category head at biscuits major Parle Products.

It seems to be working. Quick commerce is the fastest growing channel for all leading
fast-moving consumer goods
companies, accounting for 30-40% of their total
online retail sales
, according to company disclosures in earning calls.
These platforms are also expanding their basket with larger FMCG packs to cater to monthly shopping needs but also non-groceries such as electronic products, home improvement, kitchen appliances, basic apparel, shoes and toys amongst others.
""Consumers have all the apps on their phones and all they want is quick deliveries at the best price,"" said Rao of Parle Products.
The increasing
competition
is putting pressure on ecommerce majors to reduce delivery time.
'Market acquisition cost'
Flipkart is even eyeing a quick-commerce foray by piloting a 10-minute delivery service called Minutes in some parts of Bengaluru.
Jayen Mehta, managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation that owns the Amul brand, said now that people are buying regularly from quick commerce with an increase in their assortment, legacy ecommerce platforms like Big Basket and Amazon are trying to deliver faster and same day, which has increased competition pressure.
""At the end of the day, consumers compare across channels before buying. So, pricing equality has become important,"" Mehta said. ""But then, quick commerce has a delivery charge if the order is below a certain value,"" he added.
Also read: How the advent of e-commerce has reinvented the growth of traditional retail
But does their business model allow quick-commerce players to wage a sustained price war against ecommerce platforms?
Quick commerce model requires multiple dark stores to be set up in close vicinity in each market, while ecommerce players mostly make deliveries from centralised warehouses.
But then, quick commerce platforms right now are at a phase where ecommerce was 7-8 years back, said Devangshu Dutta, CEO of consulting firm Third Eyesight.
""Price matching by quick commerce is to acquire
market share
and is part of market acquisition cost even when it might not be profitable at a per unit transaction level,"" he told ET. ""They may have to sacrifice margins in the short term to get customers shopping more frequently.""
Blinkit chief executive Albinder Singh Dhindsa earlier this month said the advent of quick commerce has made people want things faster than they would have otherwise got from ecommerce.
""This has led to a direct share shift of a number of non-grocery use cases to quick commerce where customers were primarily reliant on ecommerce for buying these products,"" he said in the Zomato-owned quick-commerce platform's June quarter earnings release.
Dhindsa said quick-commerce platforms are gaining sales by incremental growth in consumption, shift in purchases from next day ecommerce deliveries and mid-premium retail chains.
Citing an example, he claimed the demand Blinkit has generated for online-first oral care brand Perfora is a testament that such brands' growth and adoption on quick commerce is much faster than on ecommerce.

Amazon India set to tweak seller fees,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazon-india-set-to-tweak-seller-fees/articleshow/112748689.cms,24-08-2024,"(This story originally appeared in
on Aug 24, 2024)
Bengaluru:
Ecommerce company
Amazon India is set to tweak its seller fee structures with effect September 9, with several categories seeing a
reduction
in commissions in the run up to the festive season.
The firm has reduced commissions in the range of 3-12% for 59 sub-categories,
Amazon
India's director of
selling partner services
, Amit Nanda, told ET. The reduction is focused on products with low average selling price (
ASP
), he said. ""We wanted to help our sellers in planning for their Diwali and other festive sales... we're hoping sellers will find it as cheap, if not cheaper, to sell some products on Amazon compared to their offline channels,"" Nanda said.
In March, ET reported about Amazon increasing commissions in the range of 10-30% across major segments. At the time, it had shifted several categories like car electronics, keyboards and mouses, and personal care appliances from a single flat commission to a tiered system based on ASP. This time, categories like apparel, home furnishing, fashion and sports will see a reduction in seller commissions.
In apparels, for instance, the new commission range for ethnic wear is 4.0-17.5% depending on the ASP, compared with 7.5-17.5% now. For men's t-shirts, Amazon will now levy a fee of 5.0-21.0%, compared with 13.5-21.0%, while for sweatshirts and jackets, it will be 8.0-12.0% against 8.0-24.0%.
For saree and dress materials, the new fee will range between 8.0% and 23.0%, against 14.0% to 23.0%. For fashion jewellery, it will range between 17.5% and 22.5%, compared with 22.5% and 24.0% at present.

Reliance Retail and Clarks end joint venture in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-and-clarks-end-joint-venture-in-india/articleshow/112733653.cms,23-08-2024,"Reliance Retail
and UK-based footwear brand
Clarks
have ended their joint venture, which was established two years ago. Sources told TOI that differences over the partnership's terms led to the decision, with the venture reportedly ""not working out.""
As a result of the terminated partnership, Clarks has started closing its stores across India. Industry sources revealed that Clarks recently shut down outlets in Inorbit Malls and DLF Malls. The brand, which operated over 30 stores in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Hyderabad, is gradually scaling back its presence in the country.
While Reliance Retail did not respond to requests for comment, Clarks was also unavailable for immediate feedback.
Reliance Retail has been a sought-after partner for many global brands entering the Indian market, leveraging its extensive resources and local expertise. Clarks, however, has a longer history in India, initially partnering with
Future Group
in 2011. Following Future Retail's bankruptcy, the brand transitioned to a partnership with Reliance Retail.
Amid this development, it remains uncertain whether Clarks will seek a new partner in India or operate through a fully-owned subsidiary. This comes at a time when several global brands are expanding their footprint in the Indian market.

's announcement of USD 1 billion investment in India, saying the US retailer was not doing any great service to the Indian economy but filling up for the losses it had suffered in the country. He said that their huge losses in
India
""smells of
predatory pricing
"", which is not good for the country as it impacts crores of small retailers.
Launching a report on 'Net Impact of
e-commerce
on Employment and Consumer Welfare in India' here, the minister lambasted the e-commerce companies, questioning their business model that has been impacting small retailers in the country.
""When Amazon says that we are going to invest a billion dollars in India and we all celebrate, and we forget the underlying story that the billion dollars are not coming in for great service or any great investment to support the Indian economy. They made a billion-dollar loss in their balance sheet that year, they had to fill in that loss.
""And how did that loss get caused, they paid Rs 1,000 crores to professionals. I do not know who these professionals are...I would love to know, which chartered accountants, professionals or lawyers get Rs 1,000 crores unless you are paying all the top lawyers to block them so that nobody can fight a case against you,"" the minister said.

Growth of e-commerce through predatory prices is a concern for small retailers: Piyush Goyal
He wondered whether the Rs 6,000 crore loss in one year does not smell of predatory pricing, as they are just an e-commerce platform and those companies are not allowed to do B2C (business to consumer) business.
As per the policy, the e-commerce platform legally can not do B2C in the country.
The minister alleged that these companies only re-route all the businesses through an entity to show that it is B2B.
""How are they doing it? Should this not be a matter of concern for us,"" he said.

Piyush Goyal isn't happy with online shopping boom, warns India will become a country of couch potatoes
He added that the e-commerce sector has a role, but one has to think ""very"" carefully and cautiously about what that role is.
""How that role can be in an organised fashion. Is predatory pricing policies good for the country?"" Goyal asked.
He also said that e-commerce companies are eating into the small retailer's high-value, high-margin products that are the only items through which the mom-and-pop stores survive.
The minister also said that with the fast-growing online retailing in the country, ""Are we going to cause huge social disruption with this massive growth of e-commerce"".

Citing examples of Western countries, Goyal said Europe and America have seen the consequences of this.
""What has happened to the mom-and-pop stores there? How many do you see surviving, why did Switzerland allow e-commerce until recently (so late),"" he said, adding ""...I am not wishing away e-commerce, it is there to stay"".
Further, he said one has to see the impact of cloud kitchens on restaurants and people buying food items online.
""We will land up becoming a country of couch potatoes, watching OTT and having food at home every day,"" he said.
Commenting on online pharmacies, the minister said, ""We have to assess what is happening to 5 lakh pharmacies of the country"".
He expressed concern over these firms selling medicines online.
""Online, you can order whatever you want...it is a matter of concern,"" Goyal said, adding ""How many mobile stores do you see in the corner, and how many were there 10 years ago? Where are all those mobile stores? Will only Apple or the large retail sell mobile phones and their accessories?.""
He pointed out that India is not a developed nation like the US and Switzerland with high per capita income, and a large section of people need affirmative action and help here.
""Of course, I do not deny that technology will play its part, technology is a means to empower, to innovate, to meet consumer requirements, probably sometimes more efficiently, but we will have to see that it grows in an orderly fashion,"" he said.
People have to see that this connectivity and convenience is citizen-centric, he said, adding that in the race for market share of online retailers at 27 per cent a year, ""we do not land up causing huge disruption for the 100 million small retailers across the country"".
Amazon India
is facing rising competitive intensity in India from players like
Flipkart
and SoftBank-backed Meesho, as well as the onslaught of firms like Blinkit, Swiggy's Instamart and Zepto that are making aggressive inroads into the market as busy consumers opt for the convenience of instant delivery of grocery and many other household items.
Last year, Amazon had talked of plans to invest USD 15 billion more in India, taking its total investment in the country to USD 26 billion.
After meeting with Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
during his visit to the US in 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said: ""I had a very good and productive conversation with Prime Minister Modi. I think we share a number of goals.
Amazon is one of the biggest investors in India. We have invested USD 11 billion to date and intend to invest another USD 15 billion, which will bring the total to USD 26 billion. So, we are very much looking forward to the future of partnering"".
Goyal also criticised the report, saying he does not agree with the findings of the study 'Net Impact of e-commerce on employment and consumer welfare in India'.
""I would like to completely disassociate myself from this report...I do not agree with any of these findings....I think, in the urge to show that this has not had an impact on employment in India, the researchers have lost sight of even the statistics, which EY has put out,"" the minister said.
Talking about a finding in a report about the growth of e-commerce in India over the next 10 years, he said, ""I do not see it as a matter of pride that half our market may become part of the e-commerce network 10 years from now; it is a matter of concern"".

"Amid e-commerce surge, Indian shoppers continue to buy from retail chains",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amid-e-commerce-surge-indian-shoppers-continue-to-buy-from-retail-chains/articleshow/112684949.cms,21-08-2024,"New Delhi: Despite the rise of e-commerce,
Indian shoppers
are continuing to buy from
retail chains
especially when it comes to
premium products
and during
big discount days
or
festive periods
, as per a latest study by market researcher NielsenIQ.
The study shows that these big shopping periods contribute 20% of incremental sales for FMCG and 60% for consumer electronic products.
Non-food categories grow 1.8 times faster than food during these periods, driven by deep discounts and consumer preference for non-essentials. Categories such as toothpaste, toilet soap, and washing powder lead the charge, benefits with 20-30% incremental sales during big days, it said.
NielsenIQ said India is the only market in the Asia-Pacific region to consistently deliver double-digit growth in
modern retail
for FMCG and electronics.
FMCG has witnessed a 2% increase in the modern trade format in urban India in the year to March 2024 as compared to same period last year.
Consumer electronics
observed a 4% rise in the same period. “The modern trade channel continues to offer a consistent and convenient shopping environment, which remains attractive to consumers, even during periods of inflation,” Sonika Gupta, executive director of consumer success for India at NielsenIQ said.

The study also revealed that there is a growing preference for premium-plus pricing products in modern trade that make up 40% of
FMCG sales
and 30% of consumer electronics. Gupta said that for the sake of superior benefits and features, consumers are willing to pay twice the average price for newly launched products.
Private labels
are growing at a 1.5 times faster rate than large manufacturers in the modern trade landscape. Small manufacturers are driving 70% of the new launches. Small packs are being preferred over larger pack sizes and growing at double the rate of large sizes. Emerging brands in the electronics sector are also experiencing high double-digit growth.
Food and grocery retail chain
Avenue Supermarts
, which owns and operates the DMart chain, said in its investor meeting held earlier this month that the scale-up of quick commerce has not impacted their business.
Neville Noronha, managing director and chief executive of Avenue Supermarts, told analysts “If you say a city that is not having any intense quick commerce versus a city that has quick commerce, there could be a 1% to 2% SSSG (same store sales growth) CAGR impact.”

Chatterjee said Decathlon has some single-digit sourcing from Bangladesh but is not very significant. He said that they are observing the situation there but did not react to it immediately. The company had lost three weeks of supply.
“We have a sourcing team inside India that always creates a plan for the multi-supply which means even though we have a dependency, we try to mitigate the dependency. As of now, we do not see a strong situation that can disrupt our supply chain because of the Bangladesh situation. But at the same time, we are looking at the future impact of the situation that the country is facing. So as of now, we are not changing any plans. I think the country is coming back on track in terms of factory opening, people operating, and exports are happening. But we need to keep observing as to what must be done in the future,” Chatterjee added.
The brand aims to reduce carbon emissions by 48% by the next three years.
Steve Dykes, global chief retail and countries officer of Decathlon said, “India is a cornerstone of Decathlon’s global ambition. Its vibrant market and talented workforce present unprecedented opportunities. We are committed to accelerating our growth here, expanding our reach, and making a positive impact on people’s lives through sports.”

Death of the kirana store: Will quick commerce quicken it?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-ecommerce-quick-commerce-tata-big-basket-blinkit-swiggy-instamart-piyush-goyal-ecommerce-death-of-the-kirana-store-will-quick-commerce-quicken-it/articleshow/112678166.cms,21-08-2024,"Kiranas, the small neighbourhood family-run retail stores, are known for community commerce, the communication on first-name terms, the familiar smell of the merchandise, a bit of haggling, and a little small talk. However, new consumer preference for speed is moving buyers away from
kirana stores
. After
e-commerce
, now
quick commerce
is eating into India's large kirana sector which comprises nearly 12 million stores, selling groceries and personal care and other items.
People are starting to shift some of their grocery shopping from local stores to quick commerce platforms such as
Blinkit
, Instamart, Zepto and BB Now, which are often able to offer products 10%-15% cheaper than local stores.
When time is money, especially in urban areas, people are willing to pay a little more to save on it. When quick commerce gained shape in India during the Covid pandemic, a large section of the industry had written it off. Their argument was that Indian consumers were not going to pay convenience fees, no matter what. Some even insisted that consumers would happily wait for a few hours or even a day, if that meant they would get their orders delivered free. Today, one after the other, leading
FMCG companies
in their 2023-24 earnings report state that quick commerce is now not just their fastest growing channel, it is what is driving their e-commerce business growth itself, ET has reported.
Eating into kirana sector
New-age logistics firm
Delhivery
’s chief executive Sahil Barua has told ET in an interview that
quick commerce is impacting mainly kiranas
or neighbourhood retail stores. ""Over 95% of the market is not amenable to quick commerce…. D2C (Direct-to-consumer) sector is around 15% of ecommerce today and more than half of that is fashion…a very small part of which is on quick commerce. If you layer it up, quick commerce is affecting only a minor part of FMCG, and maybe some part of electronics but it’s not affecting ecommerce as much as people think. I’m not sure that quick commerce is eating (share from ecommerce). The reality is quick commerce is eating share from kirana stores,"" Barua has told ET.

As the quick commerce players marry convenience with lightning speed and steep discounts, an unassailable proposition for homemakers and bachelors alike, kiranas are under huge stress. Executives across FMCG companies such as
Nestle
, Parle,
ITC
,
Marico
and
Emami
have told ET that quick commerce platforms now contribute 30-50% of their annual ecommerce sales.
A slowdown at India’s 12 million kirana stores intensified in the last quarter of 2023. And that’s the period when quick commerce companies gained share for not just impulse categories such as soft drinks and snacks, but also large staples packs of 5 kg and 10 kg.
ET has reported that quick commerce companies are now increasing the total weight which can be delivered per order as consumers have started doing monthly large pack shopping from 1-10 of every month replacing modern retail stores and other e-commerce platforms. Large fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies also want to initiate sales of such packs through quick commerce as they do not want to miss out on the sales opportunity.
An ITC spokesperson told ET while
earlier consumers would largely buy from quick commerce for impulse
, indulgence or convenience, this behaviour has evolved over time with people also undertaking monthly grocery shopping.
Ayush Gupta, who heads KRBL’s
domestic market that makes staples like India Gate rice
, told ET a few months ago that the sale of staples through these new quick commerce channels are growing 100% quarter-on-quarter. “On the other hand, growth in kirana grocery stores is about 10%, though on a larger base,” he says.
Piyush Goyal slams E-commerce portals for unlawful actions: There are lies, damn lies and then there is data
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday expressed concerns over the rapid expansion of e-commerce firms in India, describing it as a ""matter of concern"" rather than an achievement.
Minister flags threat to small stores
Union Commerce Minister
Piyush Goyal
on Wednesday expressed concerns over the rapid expansion of e-commerce firms in India, describing it as a ""matter of concern"" rather than an achievement and raising questions about the potential social disruption that might follow this surge.

Growth of e-commerce in India 'matter of concern, nothing to be proud of', says Piyush Goyal
The race for market share by e-commerce, which is growing at 27 percent per year, can cause potential disruptions for the 100 million small retailers across the country who also serve the market, Goyal has warned.
The minister expressed concern over the imbalance between small traders and large retailers, highlighting the decline of small mobile stores. ""How many mobile stores do you see now on the corner? And how many were there 10 years ago? Where are those mobile stores? Will only Apple or the large retailers sell mobile phones and their accessories?"" he questioned, underscoring the challenges faced by small retailers in the current market landscape. He also raised concerns about the pricing strategies used by some e-commerce firms, questioning, ""Is predatory pricing policy good for the country?""
Though Goyal was not talking of quick commerce specifically, the threat of e-commerce to small stores has become severe due to growing quick commerce which eats right into the grocery, staples and personal care business of small stores.
Hope yet for kirana?
Zomato-owned quick commerce platform Blinkit's chief executive officer Albinder Singh Dhindsa said in its earnings release earlier this month that quick commerce is gaining by incremental growth in consumption, share shift from next-day delivery e-commerce and mid-premium range modern retail in large cities. “We are not taking share away from kiranas, or from value focused large retail players like DMart. The value focused items available in these formats are hard to replicate in our business; especially in categories like staples, where price sensitivity is higher and we don’t have the ability to sell open SKUs that brick and mortar can. Most kiranas also offer personalised commerce such as the khata system for their customers, while we sadly, aren’t able to,” Dhindsa said.
Kirana stores thrive on intimate community commerce which includes not only familiarity between the buyer and seller but also the credit system where buyers can pay later. This is a big edge kirana stores enjoy over other modes of retail but only in small towns and rural areas where quick commerce has yet to reach.
If kiranas have to survive, they will have to digitalise fast. Last year, Hindustan Unilever (
HUL
), the country's biggest packaged consumer goods firm, said it will help onboard nearly 1.3 million kirana stores on the central government's Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) network, helping them compete with e-commerce and quick service grocery retailers. ONDC is a freely accessible and inclusive platform that aims to democratise e-commerce. It is expected to benefit small merchants with more advanced technologies and better business mechanisms.
About 12 million kirana stores in India generate over $800 billion in annual business, yet most of them do not have a digital footprint. These sellers continue to depend on orders received over call and Whatsapp for their home delivery business which constitutes over 10% of their business — that's an $80 billion plus kirana led home delivery business that already exists today, in spite of availability of quick commerce. Quick commerce at under $4 billion is a small fraction of the kirana home delivery business even today.
Kiko Live, a SaaS solution for kirana stores, said in March it had processed over one lakh total orders on the ONDC network. Since its onboarding on the open network in December last year, sellers on Kiko have witnessed significant business growth with nearly 2,500 orders per day. The company works directly with kirana stores to digitize their business.
Kiranas can survive mega e-commerce with digitalistaion but can they withstand the onslaught of quick commerce which not only promises speed and ease but also lower prices? The answer will be known as the quick commerce expands further and faces new challenges which might force it to change its business models, providing breathing space for kiranas.
There is also a possibility of partnerships between quick commerce and kirana businesses under innovative formats. ET reported a few months ago that
Reliance Industries
’ retail arm, Reliance Retail will not compete with Blinkit and Zepto with a 10-minute delivery model for its proposed re-entry into quick commerce venture next month. Instead the country’s largest retailer is planning a 30-minute delivery model with a wider assortment than existing quick commerce companies which will be fed by Reliance’s own stores and lakhs of kirana stores which source products from the company, two executives aware of the plans had told ET. The kiranas are part of the JioMart Partner initiative whereby they source products from Reliance Retail’s wholesale arm and have their backend connected.

Growth of e-commerce through predatory prices is a concern for small retailers: Piyush Goyal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/growth-of-e-commerce-through-predatory-prices-is-a-concern-for-small-retailers-piyush-goyal/articleshow/112676038.cms,21-08-2024,"Commerce and Industry Minister
,
Piyush Goyal
raised concern about the functioning of the
E-commerce
sector, saying that E-commerce is eating into the
small retailers
by giving heavy discounts on products.
Goyal charged E-commerce players with predatory pricing and not giving a level playing field to small retailers.
Speaking at an event for the Report Launch on 'Net Impact of E-Commerce on Employment and Consumer Welfare in India Goyal said, ""What does e-commerce do we all think that?, they are making things so much cheaper. If I go to a store and buy a five-star chocolate or a box of chocolates, It's going to cost me 500 rupees. I can get it delivered on e-commerce for 350 rupees. It's because that's the item that had the largest margin. E-commerce is eating into the small retailers, high value, high margin products, which are the only products through which it survives.""

""Are we going to cause huge social disruption with this massive growth of e-commerce? And I don't see it as a matter of pride that half our market could become a part of the
E-Commerce Network
. Ten years from now"" the Minister said adding that he doesn't deny the role of the e-commerce sector.
He further emphasised the need to make the sector more organised, mentioning the predatory pricing being adopted by the players.
Raising the predatory pricing adopted by the e-commerce platform, the Minister said, ""If you make six thousand crore loss in one year does that not smell of predatory pricing to any of you?""
""When
Amazon
says we are going to invest a billion dollars in India and we all celebrate, we forget the underlying story that this billion dollars is not coming for any great service or investment to support the Indian economy,"" he said.
The Commerce and Industry Minister questioned Amazon and said, ""They made a billion-dollar loss in their balance sheet that year, they had to fill in that loss. If you make 6000 crore loss a year doesn't it sound like predatory pricing to you? They are after all an E-commerce platform, they are not allowed to do B2C, legally...However, the reality is all of you buy on these platforms, how are they doing it? Should it not be a matter of concern for us?""
The minister said the predatory pricing and huge discounts by big e-commerce players will create a disruption in the businesses of India's 100 million small retailers and the government is concerned about that.

Quick commerce companies increase weight that can be delivered per order as consumers opt for larger packs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-companies-increase-weight-that-can-be-delivered-per-order-as-consumers-opt-for-larger-packs/articleshow/112655681.cms,21-08-2024,"Quick commerce companies
are increasing the total weight which can be delivered per order as consumers have started doing monthly large pack shopping from 1-10 of every month replacing modern retail stores and other e-commerce platforms.
Large
fast moving consumer goods
(FMCG) companies also want to initiate sales of such packs through quick commerce as they do not want to miss out on the
sales opportunity
.
Till now, most quick commerce operators would deliver up to 15 kgs which industry executives said is getting increased to 35 kg or even a little more. Already,
Swiggy Instamart
has started up to 35 kg delivery on a bike in certain pin codes and Blinkit too has expanded the weight limit, executives said.
Edible oil and staples company,
Adani Wilmar
chief executive officer Angshu Mallick said the company is in talks with the quick commerce companies to launch more large monthly packs such as 26 kgs of non-basmati rice and 5-litre oil jars which consumers are buying from 1st to 10th of every month as part of their
monthly shopping
routine.
An
ITC
spokesperson said while earlier consumers would largely buy from quick commerce for impulse, indulgence or convenience, this behaviour has evolved over time with people also undertaking monthly
grocery shopping
. The company has significantly scaled up its presence in quick commerce.
Live Events
“We have launched specially curated
large packs
on quick commerce in line with
consumer preference
. Large packs such as Aashirvaad atta 10kg pack, Fiama soaps pack of 8, Dark Fantasy 300g and Marie Biscuits 1kg packs are some that are available on quick commerce,” the person said.
Emails sent to Swiggy, Blinkit and Zepto remained unanswered till Tuesday press time.
Quick commerce has become the fastest growing channel for
FMCG companies
as consumers in large 10-15 cities are increasingly buying here due to convenience, faster and scheduled deliveries, and better discounts. For most FMCG companies, the channel is already 30-40% of their total e-commerce sales.
Tata Consumer Products
management told analysts recently that almost 35% of its ecommerce business is from quick commerce.
Parle Products senior category head B Krishna Rao said as consumers have started planned purchases from quick commerce, the demand for large packs and mid-sized packs have gone up with both together accounting for 35% of the total quick commerce sales for the company. “We have also rolled out quick commerce specific packs priced between Rs 40-70 and the large ones which were earlier sold only through modern trade,” he said.
Executives said while consumers are buying large packs in the beginning of the month, they shift to mid to small size packs in the latter half.
Zomato-owned quick commerce platform Blinkit chief executive officer Albinder Singh Dhindsa said in its earnings release earlier this month that quick commerce is gaining by incremental growth in consumption, share shift from next day delivery e-commerce and mid-premium range modern retail in large cities.
“We are not taking share away from kiranas, or from value focused large retail players like DMart. The value focused items available in these formats are hard to replicate in our business; especially in categories like staples, where price sensitivity is higher and we don’t have the ability to sell open SKUs that brick and mortar can. Most kiranas also offer personalised commerce such as the khata system for their customers, while we sadly, aren’t able to,” Dhindsa said.

Ambani is drawing on China-linked co's help in his battle with Tata,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ambani-is-drawing-on-china-linked-cos-help-in-his-battle-with-tata/articleshow/112641561.cms,20-08-2024,"Asia’s richest man, who made a glamorous splash this year with a $600 million wedding bash for his son, is now in a battle to hawk fashion to paying customers. Yet in this fight, Mukesh Ambani is getting beaten by a much older conglomerate. Things are becoming serious enough for him to enlist Chinese help.
Sales at
Trent
Ltd., the retail unit of the $165 billion Tata Group, have tripled over their pre-pandemic levels in dollar terms. Net profit has surged 12 times.
Zudio
, the retailer’s in-house
fast-fashion
brand, has caught the imagination of a young clientele with trendy clothing at cheap prices.

Once rebuffed, a Chinese company finds the Ambani route to India
Four years ago, there were 80
Zudio stores
in the world’s most-populous nation. Last quarter, the count reached nearly 560 — in 164 cities. Quick inventory turnover in places where rents are reasonable means high profits even at low margins.

Reliance's app, stores may soon sport Shein
The problem for Ambani
Live Events
All of this is a problem for Ambani. Apart from being a petrochemicals czar, a telecom titan and a media mogul, the 67-year-old is also India’s largest vendor of all kinds of merchandise. His flagship
Reliance Industries Ltd. has poured more than $2 billion
into its retailing unit over the past year, according to a recent report in The Economic Times.
That isn’t all.
Reliance Retail
raised over $6 billion during the pandemic from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and Singapore, along with General Atlantic and Silver Lake Partners. Last year, it took in more money from Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and KKR & Co. at a valuation of $100 billion. Ambani’s No. 1 task is to now lead the unit to a blockbuster initial public offering or a spinoff. For that, he badly needs the fast-fashion crown.
Can Shein help Reliance?
Enter — or rather, reenter — Shein. New Delhi had responded to its 2020 border skirmishes with China by banning some Chinese apps. The e-commerce firm, wildly popular with Indian teenagers, had to leave. As the government starts relaxing its stance,
Shein
is making a comeback, according to media reports, but with platform, data and operations reportedly controlled by Reliance.
It’s good news for Shein. The world’s largest web-only fashion brand, founded in Nanjing and now headquartered in Singapore, has its own IPO coming up. A partnership with the firm may be the sharpest arrow in Ambani’s quiver.
A year ago, Ambani launched Yousta, a store where everything is available under 999 rupees ($12), pitching it directly against Zudio. But the results aren’t showing, yet.
Reliance
Retail’s 8% year-on-year sales growth in the June quarter was largely from air-conditioners, refrigerators, TVs and groceries. The company cited “tepid discretionary demand” for fashion and lifestyle.
Granted, with revenue of more than $36 billion,
Reliance
Retail is a lot bigger than Trent’s $1.5 billion-a-year franchise. Nevertheless, the Tata firm racked up 56% expansion in sales last quarter.
Growing 5 percentage points faster than overall sales, value retail, excluding food and grocery, will be a $170 billion market in India by 2026, according to consulting firm Wazir Advisors. Apparel accounts for the biggest share of the pie. With a public float drawing near, Ambani needs a quick win. As part of his succession plan, the tycoon appears to have earmarked retail for his 32-year-old daughter, Isha Ambani. He would rather hand over a mature business — a solid No. 1 in key categories — rather than one scrambling for market share and guzzling cash.
That should set up an interesting competition between Ambani and Noel Tata. The half-brother of Ratan Tata, the 86-year-old chairman emeritus of the group’s holding company, set out to build a cheaper, more ubiquitous Indian version of Zara. (Zara’s owner Inditex SA has been a long-time Tata partner.) He has delivered. Trent shares have tripled in the past year.
What’s more, Trent is replicating the success of Zudio’s private brands elsewhere. At Star, the hypermarket chain it runs in collaboration with UK’s Tesco Plc, the share of in-house labels has grown to 72% from 63% in one year, according to the latest quarterly earnings presentation. That figure is not more than 15% to 20% for Reliance Retail, according to the Ken, a news website. Ambani has some catching-up to do. Shein is a great name to throw at young buyers, but it may not be enough to close the gap.
The stakes are high on the other side, too. Sustaining the success at Trent is also important to Noel Tata, 67. He has a shot at joining the board of the holding company that controls the sprawling empire.
Whatever the outcome of the contest, one thing is clear: When it comes to affordable casual wear, young adults in India are about to be spoiled for choice by two of its largest conglomerates — and all for under $12.

"Retail players, QSRs slashed jobs in FY24 amid slowdown",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-players-qsrs-slashed-jobs-in-fy24-amid-slowdown/articleshow/112612206.cms,19-08-2024,"Mumbai | New Delhi: About a dozen listed lifestyle, grocery retailers and quick-service restaurants (
QSRs
) reduced their employee count by nearly 26,000 in FY24, retreating from the hiring spree of the past two financial years after they slowed down
store expansion
rate amid weakening demand.
According to their latest annual reports, the reduction was completely led by five retailers -
Reliance Industries
' retail arm, Titan,
Raymond
, Page and Spencers - which saw their combined workforce decline 17% or by 52,000 people. The staff count was across permanent and contractual employees and adjusted for attrition in the retail segment, the second largest employer after agriculture. These retailers had a combined workforce of 429,000 people in FY24 compared to 455,000 employees a year ago.
""There is a shortage of talent and we are trying to tie up with universities so that the industry has the option to hire. Some companies might have reduced staff due to shutting of some business, but companies like
Shoppers Stop

Trent
continue to expand and will require staff,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of Retailers Association of India that represents organised retailers in the country.
Consumers had started reducing non-essential spending such as that on apparel, lifestyle products, electronics and dining out since Diwali 2022 due to
inflation
, increase in interest rates, job losses in sectors like startups and IT, and an overall slowdown in the economy. India's retail sales expansion slowed to 4% last year after a surge in spending across segments-from clothes to cars-in the post-pandemic period, triggered by revenge shopping.

RIL in its annual report said the overall voluntary separations in FY24 were lower than FY23 and the retail industry typically has a high employee turnover rate, especially in store operations.
""Store productivity usually happens in cycles and we have seen consumers unleash their spending post pandemic, which led to retailers expanding their network or square footage. However, if some of the stores are unviable, then management teams are now highly objective, even ruthless, and will shut stores,"" said Devangshu Dutta, founder of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight. ""In addition, any company planning to list would like to have healthy and lean operations, although we cannot pin-point it to Reliance in this case.""
Weak sales saw these retailers having the slowest pace of store expansions in at least five years at 9%. The retail sector took 7.1 million square feet of space across top eight cities in 2023, which is expected to dip to 6-6.5 million sq ft in 2024, according to commercial real estate services firm CBRE.
""There's an enormous management bandwidth requirement to just get this entire ship running in the right trajectory, right direction, and with the relevant speed. We are thinking about what this company will be 10 years from now. And hence, if you want to reach there in a nice way without too much damage or bruises, then what is the kind of talent we need to have today in the next 2 years, in the next 3 years?""

"Rakhi festive sales expected to surge over Rs 12,000 crore: Confederation of All India Traders",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/rakhi-festive-sales-expected-to-surge-over-rs-12000-crore-confederation-of-all-india-traders/articleshow/112605665.cms,18-08-2024,"The
Confederation of All India Traders
(CAIT) on Sunday anticipated a festive trade of over Rs 12,000 crore across the country during the
Rakhi
festival.
The trade body said that the markets are witnessing a massive rush for
Rakhi shopping
, and people are very enthusiastic about the festival. It urged customers to celebrate the festival with Indian goods.
Observing the demands for indigenous Rakhis, the trade body stated that customers prefer indigenous Rakhis over
Chinese Rakhis
during this year's festive season.
""For several years now, only indigenous Rakhis have been sold in the country, and this year too, there was neither demand for nor any presence of Chinese Rakhis in the market,"" the CAIT said in a note.
Praveen Khandelwal, CAIT's National General Secretary and Member of Parliament from Chandni Chowk stated that the business during the Rakhi festival will reach Rs 12,000 crore, compared to last year's trade of approximately Rs 10,000 crore.
Live Events
In 2022, the business was around Rs 7,000 crore, in 2021 it was Rs 6,000 crore, in 2020 it was Rs 5,000 crore, in 2019 it was Rs 3,500 crore, and in 2018 it was Rs 3,000 crore, as per Khandelwal.
Khandelwal and CAIT's National President, B.C. Bhartia, mentioned that this year, a special feature of the Rakhis is that special types of Rakhis have been made from famous products of various cities across the country.
According to the CAIT representatives, the customers are also demanding Khadi Rakhi made in Nagpur, Sanganeri Art Rakhi from Jaipur, Seed Rakhi from Pune, Woolen Rakhi from Satna in Madhya Pradesh, Bamboo Rakhi made from tribal items, Tea Leaf Rakhi from Assam, Jute Rakhi from Kolkata, Silk Rakhi from Mumbai, Date Rakhi from Kerala, Pearl Rakhi from Kanpur, Madhuband Maithili Art Rakhi from Bihar, Soft Stone Rakhi from Pondicherry, Flower Rakhi from Bangalore, and more.
There is also high demand for Rakhis that display national pride, such as Tricolor Rakhi, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam Rakhi, Bharat Mata Rakhi, as per the CAIT representatives.
They added that the designer Rakhis and silver Rakhis are also selling well in the market.
The CAIT representatives expected festive sales of over 4 lakh crore due to the extended period of the festival this year which will be celebrated from August 19 to November 15 on the day of Tulsi Vivah.
""This year's festive series will begin with Raksha Bandhan and continue through Janmashtami, the 10-day Ganesh Utsav, Navratri, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Karva Chauth, Dhanteras, Diwali, Govardhan Puja, Bhai Dooj, Chhath Puja, and other festivals, culminating with Tulsi Vivah. During this festive period, the business community across the country is fully prepared to meet consumer demands, and traders have stocked up adequately on all products,"" CAIT added.

Retailers association urges Delhi government to reduce signage fee in the city,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-association-urges-delhi-government-to-reduce-signage-fee-in-the-city/articleshow/112571653.cms,16-08-2024,"New Delhi:
Retailers Association of India
(RAI) have urged the
Delhi government
and
Municipal Corporation of Delhi
(MCD), to reconsider the prohibitive signage fees currently being imposed in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR).
These fees are significantly higher than those in other parts of India, placing a heavy financial burden on small and medium retail traders who rely on store signage to attract customers.
RAI, representing approximately 13,667 member establishments nationwide, including large and small retailers, is committed to fostering a supportive environment for the growth of
modern retail
in India. The current signage fees in Delhi NCR, particularly in areas such as
Janakpuri
, are making it increasingly difficult for retailers to afford the necessary signage that highlights their stores to the public.
For example, the average annual fee for illuminated (LED) signboards in Delhi stands at Rs 2,68,764, more than double the cost in Mumbai’s diverse localities such as Tardeo, Vashi, and Thane, where the fee is Rs 1,00,822.
This disparity in costs is a pressing concern for Delhi’s over 1 lakh retail traders, who are essential to the local economy. High signage fees not only increase the cost of doing business but also deter retailers from effectively promoting their stores, ultimately affecting their ability to attract customers and grow their businesses.

""A revision of these fees is crucial to reduce the financial burden on these businesses, ensuring they can continue to thrive and serve their communities. By making signage more affordable, we not only support retailers but also promote better compliance with regulations, benefiting governance and enforcement efforts by the MCD,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of Retailers Association of India.
RAI said that reducing the signage fees will make it more feasible for retailers to operate in Delhi, aligning costs with those in other major cities and providing relief to consumers through lower prices.
A fair and reasonable fee structure will encourage greater adherence to the Delhi Outdoor Advertising Policy 2017, leading to higher revenues for the MCD and the Delhi Government.
Lower fees will reduce the administrative burden on the MCD, allowing for more streamlined processes and better enforcement of existing
regulations.

"Retailers, brands see 5-10% on-year growth in Independence period sales",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-brands-see-5-10-on-year-growth-in-independence-period-sales/articleshow/112548807.cms,15-08-2024,"Retailers
and
brands
said there has been a 5-10% growth in sales during the Independence period sales this year as compared to last, driven by improvement in sentiments, premiumisation with a marginal recovery in volume or number of units sold for categories like smartphones and laptops, industry executives said.
While consumers lapped up premium products in cities and large towns continuing the trend of the last three years, demand in rural areas continued to be muted this month.
“Consumer sentiment appears to have improved a bit more than what it was for the rest of the year. We expect 5-10% growth in sales while volume wise there might be an improvement only in the grab and go categories like mobile phones and laptops,” said Nilesh Gupta, director at Vijay Sales, a leading consumer electronic retail chain in Delhi-NCR, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.
Departmental store chain Lifestyle chief executive officer Devaranjan Iyer said consumer sentiments have turned positive in the first two weeks of August and with the long
Independence Day
weekend, we expect the growth to continue. “We are expecting to do better than last year. This year, April and May were bad, but July onwards sales have picked up. The momentum is expected to continue till festive season,” he said.

I-Day sales is the third largest sales period in India after festive season and Republic Day, and is an indicator for demand in the upcoming festive season spanning with Onam and ending with Diwali.
Companies like Samsung, Reliance Retail, LG India, Vijay Sales, Marks and Spencer, Croma, Puma and Sony ran special consumer offers and discounts for Independence Day with several starting 7-10 days before. Even ecommerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart joined the bandwagon with freedom sales from the first week of August.
Online focused television manufacturer Super Plastronics, which has the India license for brands like Kodak, Thomson and Blaupunkt, has grown sales by 30% this month over the same period last year. Chief executive Avneet Singh Marwah said there has been some pick-up in sales from July with online promotions by Amazon and Flipkart. “However, rural areas are yet to pick up,” he said.
The government earlier this week said India’s retail inflation fell to its lowest in five years in July at 3.54% with food inflation too sobering down. The industry expects macro factors like these along with normal monsoon will lead to a revival in consumption around festive season, including the rural markets.
Demand has remained muted in the January to June period of this year across categories such as electronic products, smartphones, apparel and fast moving consumer goods.

D2C festive sales could see a 40 percent increase- Gokwik Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/d2c-festive-sales-could-see-a-40-percent-increase-gokwik-report/articleshow/112521481.cms,14-08-2024,"GoKwik, an
ecommerce
enabler, forecasts a 40% surge in online sales for the upcoming festive period, led by a resilient Indian economy, growth of aspirational GenZs, and rise of D2C brands.
According to data from GoKwik's network, which includes over 4000 direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, there has been a 38% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and a 49% rise in orders in July compared to June of this year. This early spike suggests that the
festive shopping
season has begun earlier than usual and is being driven by online shopping.
This year, with more shoppers adopting a direct-to-consumer (D2C) approach, an increasing number of
Gen Z
individuals entering the workforce with disposable income, and a growing emphasis on aspirational purchasing of premium products, GoKwik anticipates a 40% increase in orders during the festive season.
“As we enter the festive season, we are witnessing an early surge in consumer activity, which is a promising sign for the industry,” said Chirag Taneja, co-founder and CEO of GoKwik. “The shift towards D2C brands is becoming more pronounced, with consumers valuing the direct connection, personalised experiences, and unique offerings these brands provide. We are committed to supporting this growth by ensuring that brands can meet the increasing demand while minimising challenges like RTO.”
Last year, brands on the GoKwik network experienced a 34% uplift in GMV and a 38% increase in orders. The brands continued to showcase a boost in order volume even as major marketplaces were running concurrent sales.
Live Events
D2C brands now see little to no impact on their sales when major marketplaces run simultaneous sales. Last year, brands in the GoKwik network also witnessed a 52% surge in sales during the significant marketplace sales, suggesting eCommerce brands have now become inert to these sale periods. The market is deepening, and shoppers show a positive sentiment toward D2C brands.
Return to Origin (RTO) rates, a critical metric for eCommerce success, saw a 7% decrease across GoKwik's network last year. This year, the company expects this improvement to double, driven by brands becoming more vigilant in understanding customer intent and enhancing communication through multiple channels.
Over 900,000 orders were RTOed last year, with the highest rates observed in Manipur (36%), Bihar (28%), and Arunachal Pradesh (28%). Specific pin codes, such as 782122 in Nagaon district, Assam, 321204 in Bharatpur district, Rajasthan, and 852138 in Saharsa district, Bihar, saw the highest RTO rates, with an average of 72% of orders being returned before delivery.
While Indian consumers are becoming more comfortable with online shopping, caution remains, particularly for high-value items, where COD continues to be a preferred payment method. To address this, D2C brands are focusing on building trust through robust communication channels, product updates, a seamless online
shopping
experience, and further measures to enhance customer service.
Tier 3 cities emerged as significant contributors during last year’s festive season, accounting for nearly 40% of total orders. This trend will continue this year, with markets and internet penetration deepening in these regions.
Additionally, Average Order Value (AOV) is projected to grow by 12-15% this festive season, driven by bundle offers, a focus on premium products, and increased gifting. Aspirational buying is rising, particularly in Tier 3 cities, where consumers increasingly spend on higher-end products, facilitated by more accessible payment modes such as Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) options and credit facilities.
“India has always shown a consumption trend unique to the peninsula. Despite the global economic slowdown, India continues to show an upward trend in spending owing to increasing disposable income across the country, including tier 3,4 cities and towns. With the heterogeneous market in India, D2C brands cater to every distinct preference and niche, which has further increased consumption. This trend will continue to rise,” Taneja added.
GoKwik houses over 4000 eCommerce brands in its network including Lenskart, Neemans, Man Matters,
Shoppers Stop
, etc, ranging from fashion, beauty, health and nutrition, electronics and other key categories of the online shopping space.

"Global markets can learn from Indian ops' decisiveness, agility, says Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/global-markets-can-learn-from-indian-ops-decisiveness-agility-michelle-gass/articleshow/112504594.cms,14-08-2024,"Michelle Gass
, chief executive of
Levi Strauss
& Co, said the
denim maker
's
global operations
should take a cue from the Indian business in terms of keeping speed, agility and execution of its
retail strategy
in a
market
, crucial to achieving its $10-billion annual revenue target, up from about $6 billion currently.
""Speed, decisiveness, agility, risk taking and making decisions, India does it really well. Every market has their own local product engine, but the bigger opportunity is operating like this speedy, agile retailer, and taking this culture of the Indian team and bringing that throughout the company is a great opportunity,"" Gass told ET in an interview, adding that the Indian team is amongst the strongest it has globally.
""This is one of the most dynamic, exciting markets I have been to, and there's so much happening. We have had strength in the market for some time, but they are constantly challenging themselves to be better and evolve and that's what's accelerating our growth here,"" she said.
Gass, a former
Starbucks
and Kohl's executive, joined Levi's last year, and assumed charge from long-time CEO Chip Bergh earlier this year.
Overall retail sales growth rate in India across segments such as apparel, footwear and quick service restaurants (QSR) slowed to 4-7% year-on-year every month in FY24, reflecting comparatively weaker consumer sentiment.

As the world's most populous nation, India is an attractive market for
apparel brands
, especially with youngsters increasingly embracing western-style clothing. But the market is also getting crowded as most global rivals - from Zara and H&M to Uniqlo and Gap - have set up shop in the country.
""There's competition everywhere around the globe, and we have had competition in the past as well. As a retailer, it is all about execution and we don't need a new strategy. We have got the formula right in India in terms of our approach to the consumer, our approach to the brand, our product assortment, and everything that goes in there. We are creating more separation and differentiation in the marketplace,"" said Gass, 56, sporting all-Levi's merchandise - a blue denim skirt paired with a black Made-in-India blouse. ""If you think about this
consumer market
, just the number of consumers who are here that fit our target? They are youthful, they are optimistic, they are savvy.""
The company posted a 54% year-on-year increase in net sales in India at ₹1,781 crore in FY23, as per the latest available filing. However, unlike rivals that report retail sales, Levi's revenues are not comparable because sales are accounted at wholesale prices to franchise partners.
Levi's, popular for its 501 jeans, said it is investing in India to grow its leadership position in denim, and strengthen its franchise partnership. She didn't elaborate on the investment plan.
Over the past decade, it consolidated its franchise network in India to 2 dozen from over 80.
""India is growing in double digits consistently. Consumers are young in India, they are also fashion forward and they get influenced with what's happening in the West and as the economy grows, there is no reason why India should not grow. India was at the 10th spot not very long ago and its sixth today. So, it will continue to grow over time,"" Harmit Singh, global chief financial and growth officer at Levi Strauss, said.

"Reliance Retail gets about Rs 15,000 cr from parent to expand presence",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-gets-over-rs-14k-cr-from-parent-to-expand-presence/articleshow/112476024.cms,13-08-2024,"Reliance Industries
has pumped about ₹14,839 crore into
Reliance Retail
as debt last fiscal year to support its long-term
investment plans
, as the flagship retail business entity of the conglomerate expands its presence to small towns and try out new store formats.
The funding, the largest by the parent in the last ten years, was routed as an inter-corporate deposit from the holding firm, Reliance Retail Ventures, according to the company's latest
financial statement
. With this, the parent has invested about ₹19,170 crore in Reliance Retail last fiscal year, including ₹4,330 crore in equity.
Reliance Retail also accelerated repayment of bank loans, which analysts see as an indication of preparations at the company to clean up its balance sheet ahead of an initial public offering. Reliance has yet to formally announce any
IPO plans
for the retail business.
The company in its FY24 earnings release said it made investments during the year in boosting
supply-chain infrastructure
and
omni-channel capabilities
. It also opened new formats like
value retail chain
Yousta and handicraft stores under the Swadesh brand.

""While Reliance Retail currently benefits from
parent company
financing, it will be interesting to observe how this financial structure evolves over the next few years, especially if they consider going public. The retail giant's ability to sustain growth while potentially transitioning to more traditional financing sources will be a key factor to watch,"" said Mohit Yadav, founder at business intelligence firm AltInfo.
An email sent to Reliance Retail seeking comment remained unanswered at Monday press time.
Reliance Retail Ventures is the holding company for the retail and FMCG businesses of Reliance and is a subsidiary of Reliance Industries. The holding company had raised ₹17,814 crore in equity in FY24 from investors and its parent.
Last fiscal year, Reliance Retail repaid long-term (non-current) bank loans of ₹8,019 crore compared with just ₹50 crore repaid in FY23. This reduced its non-current bank loan borrowings by 30% to ₹13,382 crore as on March 31, 2024. Its current or short-term unsecured borrowings from banks, meanwhile, more than halved to ₹5,267 crore.
Yet, Reliance Retail's overall debt has gone up from ₹70,944 crore in FY23 to ₹81,060 crore in FY24 due to the funding by the holding company through the debt route.

Founded in 2019 by entrepreneur siblings Aastha and Charak Almast along with associate Mani Dev Gyawali, the New Delhi-based startup currently operates 160
stores
across 35 cities. It has an omni-channel presence, selling grocery staples, snacks and beverages, personal care, home care, pet foods, hygiene products and over-the-counter medicines. It works on a franchise-owned, franchise-operated model.

"In Reliance Retail's company, Superdry to enter athleisure",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/in-reliance-retails-company-superdry-to-enter-athleisure/articleshow/112232644.cms,03-08-2024,"New Delhi:
Reliance Retail
plans to extend
Superdry
into the
athleisure
segment which will place it in direct competition with leading
sportswear
brands like
Nike
, Adidas and Asics.
Last year, the British fashion brand had inked a joint venture agreement with Reliance Brands for the sale of Superdry's intellectual property assets in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh for £40 million (nearly ₹405 crore at the time).
Superdry's foray into the athleisure segment in India will be a first for the company globally, with several stores set to be opened across India. Initially, the company will sell clothing, and later
footwear
after securing
BIS certification
.
""The company has been working on a retail format for athleisure products, which has witnessed a surge in demand since the pandemic. It might take in French retailer
Decathlon
also with large format stores, while Superdry sports will be mid-size stores,"" said a mall operator familiar with the development.
Reliance Retail did not respond to ET's queries.
Live Events
Sales of leading sports brands have sprinted in the past two years, driven by increasing awareness about fitness and surging demand for athleisure wear. With a population of more than 1.4 billion, India is one of the fastest-growing and largest international markets for sportswear and footwear companies.
Most global brands have been around in the country for more than two decades and have grown through partnerships with cricket and other sporting activities. The newer entrants, however, have been positioning themselves as comfortable lifestyle and regular
athletic wear
brands. India is seeing increasing interest in sports such as kabaddi, soccer, volleyball, hockey and badminton.
Superdry entered the country in 2012 in partnership with Reliance Brands, a venture of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL). RRVL has partnerships with independent fashion brands in segments like luxury, bridge-to-luxury and high-premium and high-street lifestyle such as Armani Exchange, Burberry, Bally, Canali, Diesel, Gas, Hugo Boss,
Hamleys
and Jimmy Choo, Valentino and Balenciaga for the Indian market. Reliance Brands also acquired toy retailer Hamleys in 2019.

FirstCry: Meet the man behind the baby products business that grew into a giant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/firstcry-meet-the-man-behind-baby-business-that-grew-into-a-giant/articleshow/112202021.cms,01-08-2024,"FirstCry, Asia's biggest the baby and
mother care
products retailer, is headed to market after more than a decade of building a business from scratch while also carving out a niche segment of its own.
Brainbees Solution
, which operates omnichannel businesses FirstCry, has announced a Rs 4,194 crore initial public offering (IPO) which will open on August 6 and close on August 8. The IPO is likely to value
FirstCry
at $3-3.5 billion.
Founded by
Supam Maheshwari
and his colleague from a previous business,
Amitava Saha
, FirstCry has been the darling of investors which include SoftBank, Tata Sons Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata, Premji Invest, Mahindra & Mahindra and TPG Growth. Though Maheshwari has scripted a unique success story by creating not only a big business but also a whole business segment, it was not an easy or straight journey for him.
The beginning of Supam Maheshwari
A mechanical engineer from Delhi College of Engineering and MBA from IIM-Ahmedabad, Maheshwari started his first company, elearning startup Brainvisa Technologies, in March 2000 which raised Rs3 crore from Infinity Ventures 3-4 months before the dotcom bubble burst.
The business started as a customer facing online test preparation play but had to pivot to a business-to-business model. After running the business as CEO for over seven years, it was acquired by Indecomm Global in 2007 for $16 million where he also saw impact on corporate business of Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
“You become richer by experience, there is no shortcut to it. Importance of cash, running a business in a cost-efficient way and building that culture internally is very important,” Maheshwari had told ET about his Brainvisa experience. He said that he has applied these lessons at FirstCry, which he founded in 2010 with Brainvisa colleague Amitava Saha.

FirstCry, a baby idea that grew into a giant
Maheshwari founded FirstCry with Saha after a personal insight. He often used to buy products for his own baby when he was abroad due to a dearth of
baby care
products in India. He realised a business focused solely on baby care products with a large range could be a success in India. That was the perfect time for an idea like FirstCry.
The winds of change were blowing for Indian parents, long used to leaning on an established circle of parents, in-laws and pediatricians for unsolicited and much needed advice on child rearing. With more young mothers returning to work quicker and joint families giving way to nuclear ones, social change was beginning to significantly change this market, with old and new companies jostling for a share of this segment — from the time a woman is expecting till the child turns five.
But it wasn't an easy market to crack. For starters, some 90% of it was locked up with old-world offline baby product retailers, thousands of them across the country. With fewer choices for their babies, Indians tended to buy fewer products or substitute adult ones. FirstCry started with barely 1,000 products on its platform. “From warehousing to last-mile delivery, everything associated with baby care is a difficult job,” Maheshwari had told ET. “We are selling products — from diaper pins weighing 5 gm to car seats weighing 25 kg. Consumers want an expert and not a generalist to sell them these products.”
FirstCry was also the first online retailer to start adding offline stores in 2012, a trend which has been followed by several vertical etailers now. And in 2012, he also launched a logistics business to fulfil its own orders. XpressBees, which is now run by Saha, started taking third-party orders in 2015 and raised its own funds after spinning off from FirstCry.
FirstCry runs a network of 1,018 FirstCry and BabyHug stores in 508 cities. The company owns 386, and the rest are franchises. Pine Kids, Cute Walk and Babyoye are among its in-house brands. It has expanded to the UAE and Saudi Arabia. It will use the IPO proceeds to open more stores and expand its business.
""Investors have liked our story and shown good response... It doesn't really matter, to be honest (the IPO pricing). When you are on a long journey of multiple decades, it doesn't matter where you are today – as long as you keep compounding. Cycles come and go, but great companies and great teams always persist, stay and create value for shareholders and for themselves. We've built something addressing a large massive TAM (total addressable market) of $120 billion by FY29. I’m very excited to be here in terms of what we're bringing to public market investors and institutional investors. What we have built so far is fairly unique in the world from my lens and we'll compound shareholder value from here on,"" Mahshwari told ET in a recent interview.

Marketing budgets leap: Slump-hit companies to spend up to 30% more on revival hopes,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/marketing-budgets-leap-slump-hit-companies-to-spend-up-to-30-more-on-revival-hopes/articleshow/112147260.cms,31-07-2024,"Kolkata|New Delhi: Makers of electronic products, automobiles and fast-moving consumer goods (
FMCG
), as well as retailers, are planning to intensify
festive season
marketing expenditure by up to 30% over last year, as they seek to pull themselves out of a sales slump, said executives.
However, they expect entry level, mass-product sales to remain tepid because of persistent inflation and low-income consumers opting for need-based consumption.
Companies are hopeful of a recovery in consumption by middle-income consumers, who may be encouraged to purchase premium products aided by income tax rate cuts in the July 23 budget. Another bump is expected from a near-50 auspicious days for weddings in the second half of the fiscal year, said the people cited above.
India's festive season is its largest consumption period, accounting for over a third of annual sales for most consumer goods.

The festive season kicks off with Onam in Kerala (early September) and then runs from Navratri till Diwali (November 1), and heralds high demand for automobiles, electronics, smartphones, fashion, household products and furniture.
Inventory for cars, motorcycles and scooters is at 55-60 days, the highest in over two years, which is spurring manufacturers to step up promotional schemes as well as ad spends this year. The slowdown in demand comes after three years of robust growth.
""While the number of new launches is lower this festive season (compared to last year), tactical spends will be high, with carmakers looking at drawing in buyers due to high stocks in the channel,"" said a senior industry executive.
Tactical advertising refers to campaigns focused on consumer offers and promotions, trying to induce spending. It accounts for 40% of the automobile industry total ad spend.
Retailers Jump In
Departmental store
retail
chains such as Lifestyle and Shoppers Stop; household appliance manufacturers LG India, Godrej Appliances and Haier; as well as FMCG companies such as
Adani Wilmar
and Parle Products are all stepping up marketing expenditure. Auto executives said companies will increase marketing spend by 20% year-on-year during the festive season.
""October-December will necessitate an increase in the marketing spend since we expect a recovery in demand during festive and multiple wedding dates boosting overall quarterly sales,"" said Devaranjan Iyer, CEO of Lifestyle. ""There has been some recovery in July itself, with single-digit growth in same-store sales. If this sustains, the festive season should be a good one.""

"Top global brands like Marks & Spencer, Walmart and Pepco may boost India sourcing after import duty relief",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/top-global-brands-like-marks-spencer-walmart-and-pepco-may-boost-india-sourcing-after-import-duty-relief/articleshow/112147374.cms,31-07-2024,"NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Global brands like Marks & Spencer,
Next
,
Decathlon
,
Primark
,
GAP
,
Walmart
, Pepco, and
Tesco
are planning to ramp up sourcing from India, industry executives told ET.
Export orders had dwindled in Tiruppur in the last three years as two major buyers, the US and Europe, reduced their purchases following the recession caused due to the pandemic and Russia-Ukraine war.
Further, the customs duty changes in the Union budget are likely to give a major fillip to Tiruppur, a textile production hub in Tamil Nadu. Tiruppur is already facing a wave of orders with some global brands diverting purchases from Bangladesh with production getting impacted there due to social unrest.
Brands who may have origins in other countries but have a presence in Australia like Kmart and Target, too are buying large volumes of garments from Tiruppur to take advantage of the India-Australia Free Trade Agreement, said KM Subramanian, president of Tiruppur Exporters Association (TEA). Also, Australian brands like BIG W and Woolworth are placing orders after the FTA.
Subramanian said all the global brands have done social auditing of the factories before placing orders. ""They have looked into the living conditions of the workers and how green the factories are. Based on their assessments, they have placed orders with Tiruppur. Next, Decathlon and Polish brand Pepco are all sourcing from Tiruppur,"" he said.
Live Events
Subramanian said global buyers are finding India as a more stable sourcing country compared to others like Bangladesh. ""So, more orders have started to pour into Tiruppur. We expect more orders to get diverted from the neighbouring nation,"" he said referring to Bangladesh.
The budget scrapped or lowered import duties on certain raw materials used in the fashion industry but only when they are exported as finished products from India.
The leather business also got an impetus in the budget. P Rajasekaran, business head, finished leather business at Tata International, said, ""The import duty waiver by the government on the export of crust and finished leather is expected to significantly increase exports of Indian leather products. We are witnessing a rise in demand for sustainable/bio leather products from global brands, and there is increased interest from key markets such as the US, China, and Europe. To meet this growing demand, we aim to boost the production of sustainable leather at Tata International manufacturing units to 50% within the next four years.""
""India is a crucial market for H&M, both in terms of sourcing and our customer base. While we do not disclose sourcing figures by country for competitive reasons, we are closely monitoring the recent reduction in customs duty on raw materials and its potential benefits. Our focus remains on our long-term sustainability goals, aiming for 100% of our materials in commercial goods to be either recycled or sustainably sourced by 2030, while supporting local industries and suppliers,"" said Yanira Ramirez, country sales manager at H&M India.
Primark said, ""Our understanding is that the list of products on which customs duties are to be reduced does not include textile raw materials and, therefore, will not affect us. We welcome progress in this space, including the negotiation of free trade agreements, as we're always reviewing new opportunities to enhance and evolve our supply chain and sourcing strategy.""
Next, GAP, Decathlon, and Zara did not respond to ET's queries.
Subramanian said exports from Tiruppur are likely to increase by 10% this fiscal following the fresh orders. In FY24, the garments hub had clocked a revenue of ?33,500 crore. There are close to 6,000 knitwear and knitwear-accessory units in Tiruppur.

How DMart plans to take on the quick commerce rivals,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/how-dmart-plans-to-take-on-the-quick-commerce-rivals/articleshow/112146632.cms,30-07-2024,"Mumbai:
Avenue Supermart
, India's biggest listed retailer by sales and market cap, said
discounting
and lower pricing will drive its growth and not
convenience
through faster delivery, downplaying the threat from
quick commerce
rivals. The owner of
DMart
supermarkets said it does not plan to launch an ultra-fast delivery model and will instead focus on opening more stores to cover catchments and clusters where quick commerce companies are currently seeing high demand.
It will continue to focus on being a
value retailer
, consciously choosing not to adopt a deep discounting strategy like some
ecommerce
players either, said Avenue Supermarts CEO and managing director Neville Noronha.
""Quick commerce is about convenience and not discount-they are giving excellent convenience. So, some top-end or affluent consumers who shop from DMart might fall off,"" he told investors on Tuesday. ""DMart is all about value, even if it's a bit inconvenient.""
""There could be a 1-2% impact from quick commerce in Mumbai but we cannot pinpoint exactly. We have been doing things differently and it's working in terms of profit and sales. So why change the model?"" said Noronha.

DMart has 365 stores, a third of them in Maharashtra and the rest across India, barring the east.
With an increasing proportion of Indian consumer purchases turning out to be unplanned and of low-to-moderate order value, there's been a rising demand for instant fulfilment, currently served by
Zepto
, Swiggy Instamart and Zomato's Blinkit among others. For most fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, online channels are now nearly 10-12% of overall sales and quick commerce platforms account for a third of that.
DMart said it has been crunching data for the last two years to gauge whether the new format is affecting it.
""Surprisingly, it is not, and if there is anything that impacts us, it's our own ability to operate stores or a store not run well,"" Noronha said.
A recent report by
JM Financial
said consolidation in quick commerce is imminent but the question is who blinks first. ""While we definitely believe the QC (quick commerce) space could eventually see three-four relevant players due to a large total addressable market, the emerging scenario, where there could be at least six serious contenders, appears unsustainable to us,"" said the report.
Within the physical retail channel, DMart has better operational metrics such as cost to sales or invested capital than Aldi and Lidl, the German retailers that are often seen as benchmarks for discount retailing and run some of the leanest retail operations globally. At ₹33,000, DMart generates nearly three times the revenue per retail square foot than grocery rivals such as
Reliance
Fresh and Spencers, according to analysts.
Also, in the ecommerce business, it is competing with Amazon, Flipkart and Big Basket that count deep discounting as their core strategy. Unlike rivals that rely on a delivery-based
distribution
model, DMart's online venture operates a hybrid model with delivery centres in areas where it has small stores, where customers can also pick up items ordered online.
While it's cautious about burning cash to push sales, the focus is to grow ecommerce capacity. ""We have told our online teams to just focus on increasing sales and not worry about losses,"" Noronha said. ""That will give an idea on how we are treating the online business.""
The retailer saw sales at its online grocery unit expand 30% in FY24 while losses narrowed as it expanded into newer areas. Sales for Avenue E-Commerce, the online subsidiary it started seven years ago, stood at ₹2,899 crore, while posting a net loss of ₹185 crore, as per the latest annual report. The online business brand DMart Ready posted a loss of ₹194 crore on sales of ₹2,202 crore in the previous
fiscal year

Bankruptcy court admits Kishore Biyani-promoted Future Retail for liquidation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/bankruptcy-court-admits-kishore-biyani-promoted-future-retail-for-liquidation/articleshow/112125023.cms,30-07-2024,"The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) admits Kishore Biyani-promoted
Future Retail Ltd
for liquidation in the absence of any viable revival plan for the company. The tribunal has also appointed Sanjay Gupta as the company’s liquidator.
The division bench of judicial member Kuldip Kumar Kareer and technical member Anil Raj Chellan while allowing the company’s resolution professional Vijaykumar V. Iyer’s application to admit the company for liquidation, observed that the maximum period of the
CIRP
has expired and no
Resolution Plan
has been approved by the CoC (Committee of Creditors).
The company has admitted liabilities of over Rs 28,452 crore. This includes secured financial creditors' claims of about Rs 14,422 crore.
“We are of the considered opinion that this is a fit case for liquidation,” said the tribunal. “. To maximise the value of the Corporate Debtor, the Liquidator shall endeavour the sale of the Corporate Debtor as a going concern under Regulation 32A clause (e) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulation, 2016,” said the tribunal in its order.
Last year in November, the company’s RP informed the stock exchange that the lenders had rejected Space Mantra Pvt Ltd’s resolution plan for Future Retail and hence the lenders have decided to admit the company for liquidation.

The trouble at
Future Group
initially started with the nationwide lockdown in March 2020. Most of the malls where Future stores were located remained shut. Subsequently, it suffered another setback in April 2022 after it failed to clinch a Rs 24,713-crore deal with
Reliance Industries
to sell its retail and wholesale business in a slump sale.
Future’s deal with Reliance collapsed after secured lenders voted against the scheme of arrangement. Lenders said they did not receive any clarity on how much money they would get from Reliance after it took possession of more than 900 large-format Future Retail stores. Reliance took over these stores in a phased manner, beginning in 2022, due to non-payment of rentals by Future Group.

Nearly 150-200 direct to consumer brands entered offline retail channel over the past two years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/nearly-150-200-direct-to-consumer-brands-entered-offline-retail-channel-over-the-past-two-years/articleshow/112100433.cms,29-07-2024,"About 150 to 200 direct to consumer brands have entered new offline channels and started operations on
quick-commerce platforms
over the past two years, as physical retailing still accounts for more than three-fourths of all retail sales.
Since 2016, more than 600
D2C brands
have started operations, and over the past three years received $4 billion investment. However, opening of newer stores also meant additional capital to fuel expansion amid funding winter over the past few quarters.
""Over the past 12 to 18 months, we have dedicated our efforts not only to providing growth capital, but also to collaborating closely with our portfolio brands in devising and executing their
multi-channel expansion
strategies. Our direct involvement with brands like WickedGud has yielded significant outcomes, including the successful establishment of their presence in over 200 Reliance Retail stores,"" said Bhavik Vasa, Cofounder, GetVantage adding that it engaged an extensive network of ecosystem partners and secured exclusive distribution partnerships for general trade and modern trade for offline sales, as well as on-demand availability for brands across various sectors, such as NOTO ice-cream, Arata, BlueTokai, and EatBetter.
The overall India D2C market was estimated to be $16.9 billion in FY23, expected to grow at a CAGR of 38% and reach $ 61.3 billion by FY27. With further expansion of the online market and integration of offline aspects into the D2C ecosystem, there will be large numbers of brands entering the market.
For instance, Udaipur-based D2C clothing brand Beyoung plans to open 100 stores by March next year and expects to boost its gross merchandise value growth at Rs 650 crore by 2027.

Consumption slowdown is forcing retailers to scale back & shut shop in unprofitable markets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/chain-reaction-sluggish-demand-takes-toll-on-retail-operations/articleshow/112070742.cms,28-07-2024,"KOLKATA: Top
retail chains
such as Reliance Retail,
Shoppers Stop
and Spencer’s Retail are facing a prolonged slowdown in consumption, pushing them to exit unprofitable markets, raise debt and control costs.
The slowdown—lasting more than 18 months—got aggravated with an extended election season and heatwaves in several parts of the country last quarter. Companies, which rapidly opened stores to tap post-pandemic revenge shopping, are now rationalising their networks among steps to sustain operations, say executives.
India’s largest retailer Reliance Retail shuttered 249 stores in the three months ended June. The company is also going slow on expansion, opening 331 new stores in the quarter compared to 470-800 stores opened every quarter in FY22, FY23 and FY24. The closures mean the retail business of Reliance Industries made 82 net new store additions last quarter--the lowest in 15 quarters.
Spencer’s Retail has decided to completely exit North and South India markets by closing 49 stores in the National Capital Region (NCR), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The step will erase Rs 490 crore of annual revenue, but the company is hopeful it will improve
profitability

Shoppers Stop chief executive officer Kavindra Mishra told investors last week that it may have to defer a few store openings this fiscal due to regulatory and other issues. The company will also borrow Rs 100 crore for expansion with demand remaining soft.
Meanwhile,
V-Mart Retail
has closed 22 stores in the first six months of 2024, as per its latest investor presentation. “Pruning underperforming locations is a natural reaction during times of demand stress,” said Devangshu Dutta, CEO of retail sector consulting firm Third Eyesight.
Pure Economics
“Demand forecasting can never be perfect due to a lag between demand assessment and supply. Retailers now try to do away with underperforming stores at the bottom of the pile quickly.
Earlier there were prestige issues in shutting down stores, but now it's acceptable industry practice and pure economics,” said Third Eyesight’s Dutta.
Analysts say most retailers expanded rapidly after the pandemic, banking on pent-up demand and revenge shopping at the time. With demand turning sluggish, the industry is now being forced to take various steps to sustain operations. At Reliance Retail, net profit rose by a modest 4.6% from a year earlier in the June quarter to Rs 2,549 crore while revenue grew 6.6% to Rs 66,260 crore. It was the slowest pace of
revenue growth
and came after a 9.8% increase in Q4FY24. Net profit and revenue from operations fell sequentially in the June quarter.
Reliance Retail chief financial officer Dinesh Taluja told analysts earlier this month that it is streamlining operations to lift margins. He said in categories like fashion and lifestyle, discretionary spend has been tepid across the industry.
Spencer’s Retail CEO Anuj Singh told analysts on Thursday the 49 stores it is closing make up nearly 22% of revenue, but also Rs 56 crore of losses at the regional Ebitda level in North and South India. “They were a drag on the balance sheet. We will now focus on Uttar Pradesh and the East where there is a sizable consumption opportunity with a 250 million population,” he added.
Singh said the store rationalisation exercise and about 35% headcount reduction at corporate offices will reduce overheads from 8% operating cost to 6.3% of total sales. “We now expect to achieve Ebitda breakeven by March 2025 which will give us the option to raise capital,” he said.
Mishra at Shoppers Stop said demand remained subdued last quarter due to fewer wedding dates, long election season with polling dates on weekend, heatwaves, and high level of cumulative inflation. All these factors combined hit growth and volume recovery, except in value fashion and beauty.
More stores shut than opened
In fact, the sustained
demand slowdown
saw chains like Pantaloons,
Spencer's Retail
and Nature’s Basket close more stores than they opened last fiscal. Retailers like V-Mart Retail, W, Aurelia and Titan Eye+ had a higher rate of
store closures
than openings in the March quarter.

According to researcher IMARC Group, the Indian handicraft sector is expected to touch annual sales of $6.21 billion by 2028, up from $3.96 billion in 2022. The sector remains fragmented and unorganised, with a few large, organised players and a plethora of regional startups, direct-to-consumer (D2C) players, and state and Centre-level handicraft platforms.
The retail division of Reliance Industries last week announced revenue of ₹75,630 crore for the quarter ended June, an 8.1% increase from ₹69,962 crore in the year-ago quarter. Reliance Retail noted in its earnings that the business expanded its network by opening 331 new stores during the quarter, taking the overall store count to 18,918.

IKEA India Country CFO Murali Iyer said the budget demonstrated commitment to supporting MSMEs and women via access to finance, infrastructure and skilling support.
""Innovative schemes, such as internship opportunities for youth and the development of Digital Public Infrastructure reflect the government's forward-thinking approach. ""Significant investments in infrastructure and tax relief measures, such as an increased standard deduction for salaried employees, will increase disposable income for consumers, providing a boost to retail,"" he said.
Retailers Association of India (RAI) CEO Kumar Rajagopalan appreciated the government's focus on empowering the middle class and rural population.
""Initiatives such as monetary support for farmers, higher exemption limits in personal income tax, and increased standard deductions will provide higher disposable income, leading to increased spending.

Moreover, the reduction of duty on gold, precious metals, and mobile phones will also provide a significant boost to these sectors, particularly during the festive season.
The budget's emphasis on MSMEs and startups, including enabling more lending and abolishing angel tax, is a positive step towards realizing their potential.

Quick commerce changes the game: Retail Inc joins Q as India shops by the minute,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-changes-the-game-retail-inc-joins-q-as-india-shops-by-the-minute/articleshow/111891288.cms,21-07-2024,"Kolkata: The shopping habit of Indians is undergoing a change, compelling retailers to adjust the way they deliver orders.
Indians are buying daily necessities and fast-moving consumer goods more frequently and in larger numbers than a few years ago, with researchers and senior executives attributing this to a growing trend of consumers seeking instant gratification, fuelled by burgeoning
quick commerce
.
Realising the consumer behaviour, mainstream retailers like
Reliance Retail
and Spencer’s Retail are focusing on online orders and reducing their delivery time. Ecommerce firm
Amazon
is trying to turn around orders faster, while rival Flipkart has introduced its own quick commerce service.
Data from research firm Kantar released this month reveal that Indians are now shopping 156 times a year for FMCG products — or once every 56 hours. This used to be 80-90 times around five years back, FMCG industry executives said.
In the last four quarters, the number of FMCG packs purchased in a quarter varied between 199 and 202, Kantar said. Around two years back, this was 163-179.
Live Events
“The size of the monthly grocery shopping basket is coming down every year as consumers are going for need-based purchases due to sheer convenience of quick commerce and other ecommerce platforms and retailers reducing their delivery time,” said Krishnarao Buddha, senior category head for marketing at biscuit and snack maker Parle Products. The number of shopping trips or orders for FMCG is going up by 15-20% every year, Buddha said. He attributed this to need-based consumption habits and houses becoming smaller in the metros and large cities whereby storage space is becoming an issue.
Amazon has started same-day delivery of groceries, while Flipkart soft-launched its quick-commerce venture, Flipkart Minutes. These developments are taking place in a market currently dominated by
Zomato
’s Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket’s BBNow and Zepto. Reliance Retail and Spencer’s Retail are moving towards faster fulfilment of orders.
Reliance Retail’s chief financial officer Dinesh Taluja told analysts on Friday that the country’s largest retail chain is going to have a big entry into hyperlocal (or faster deliveries from nearest stores), which will include not just groceries but other products too. Reliance last month launched its hyperlocal venture under its JioMart shopping app, with grocery orders to be delivered in 45-60 minutes.
“We're also leveraging our hyperlocal presence for customer acquisition and targeting them for grocery and cross-sell other categories through targeted interventions,” Taluja said. “We have a big advantage with our pan-India store network compared to any of the other online players who spend a lot on customer acquisition.”
Spencer’s Retail chief executive Anuj Singh told analysts recently that consumers looking for planned online purchases now wanted their products in an hour or so. The retail chain has been offering such an express delivery service in Kolkata for the last nine months, which improved ecommerce orders by 30%. Spencer's recently launched the service in Uttar Pradesh, in places like Varanasi and Lucknow before expanding to other states.

"Retailers including Shoppers Stop, Lifestyle and VMart bet on a flurry of wedding days in second half of this fiscal",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-including-shoppers-stop-lifestyle-and-vmart-bet-on-a-flurry-of-wedding-days-in-second-half-of-this-fiscal/articleshow/111891592.cms,21-07-2024,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: The biggest wedding of the year may be over, but retailers including
Shoppers Stop
,
Reliance Retail
, Lifestyle and
VMart
bet on a flurry of nuptial celebrations in the second half of this fiscal to reverse their tepid sales growth and boost demand.
There will be about 47 auspicious wedding dates in the second half, three times more than 14 in the first half, they reason. “We are looking at a very strong festive campaign, and weddings will be very, very big as we have somewhere around 50-odd (auspicious) days,” Kavindra Mishra, managing director of Shoppers Stop, said during its first quarter earnings call on Friday. “We believe we have got the right kind of merchandise to be a wedding destination,” he said.
In FY24, year-on-year retail sales growth rate declined every month, reflecting weak consumer sentiment across segments such as apparel, footwear, and quick service restaurants (QSR).
Last year’s comparatively slower 4-7% growth rate has sustained this year as well.
Treading with Caution on Inventory
Live Events
May and June saw 3% and 5% rise in sales growth, respectively,
Retailers Association of India
(RAI) said based on a survey of top 100 retailers. “April and May were tough, but we have started seeing some recovery in June onwards,” said Devarajan Iyer, chief executive of department store chain
Lifestyle International
.
“Consumers are back and there are signs of recovery in the July-September quarter. Q3FY25 is expected to be stronger due to the advancement of the festive season and a number of weddings. We are seeing growth at the store level and overall double-digit growth (in July),” he told ET on Saturday.
Vedant Fashions
, which owns men’s ethnic wear brand Manyavar, after declaring its results for the last quarter, said this is the first time it has seen a weak
wedding season
for five quarters in a row. It noted that a lower base will make for better sales numbers upon recovery. While companies are bullish on demand recovery, they are still cautious on orders. “We are not going overboard both in terms of expansion and having extra inventory,” said Mayank Mohan, owner of ethnic menswear brand Mohanlal Sons. “Q1FY25 was probably the worst quarter and though there were some signs of recovery from June 20 things have slowed down again. We are very careful of what we keep in the store and controlling the expenses as well,” he said. As Covid-19 eased, pent-up demand led to booming sales across athleisure wear, apparel and lifestyle products.
Consumers upgraded wardrobes after offices reopened, and eating out and socialising picked up. This led to 13-24% growth every month throughout FY23. However, after a surge in spending across a gamut of segments — from clothes to cars — in the post-pandemic period, triggered by revenge shopping, India’s retail sales expansion slowed down.
“There were some wedding days in July, which will reflect in the sale of this quarter and in the next quarter, we will have wedding days and festive season together…so overall sentiments look positive,” said Lalit Agarwal, chairman of V-Mart.

Platform Fee Surge: Why Swiggy and Zomato are charging more and how it affects you,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/platform-fee-surge-why-swiggy-and-zomato-are-charging-more-and-how-it-affects-you/articleshow/111867156.cms,19-07-2024,"India’s leading food delivery platforms,
Swiggy
and
Zomato
, have increased their
platform fees
to Rs 6 per order in Delhi and Bengaluru. This new fee, which represents a 20% rise from the previous rate, applies to all customers, regardless of whether they are enrolled in Gold or other membership plans.
The platform fee, introduced by both companies in 2023, began at Rs 2 per order. In April 2024, Zomato increased its platform fee by 25% to Rs 5 per order in major markets such as the
National Capital Region
, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Lucknow. This recent
increase
continues a pattern of fee hikes aimed at enhancing revenue and
profitability
.
Market Reaction and Historical Fee Changes
The market has reacted positively to this news, with Zomato’s shares climbing 4% to a new high of Rs 232 on July 15. Initially, Zomato’s platform fee was Rs 2 per order, which was raised to Rs 5 earlier this year. Swiggy also experimented with a Rs 7 fee in Bengaluru before settling on Rs 6.
Understanding Platform Fees
Platform fees are additional charges applied to each
food order
, separate from goods and services tax, restaurant charges, and delivery fees. These fees are crucial for the companies' revenue and cost management. Swiggy introduced platform fees in 2023, and Zomato followed suit. Zomato’s fees have increased incrementally from Rs 2 in October 2023 to Rs 5 in April 2024 in select cities.

Revenue Impact and Competitive Landscape
The fee increase is expected to boost revenue significantly for both companies. Swiggy and Zomato deliver approximately 20-25 lakh orders daily, and the additional platform fees could generate Rs 1.25 to Rs 1.5 crore per day. This revenue is critical as companies face a cap on the commissions they can charge restaurants, which ranges from 25-35% and has been a contentious issue.
Zepto, a competitor, introduced a platform fee earlier this year, generating an additional Rs 11 lakh daily from its 5.5 lakh orders. Meanwhile, Swiggy reported a 45% increase in operating revenue for the fiscal year ending March 2023, despite a 15% rise in net loss. Zomato also saw significant revenue growth, with a 69% increase in FY23.
Concerns Over Future Increases
In January, Swiggy had tested a platform fee of Rs 10 for select users, though this was not actually charged. The fee was shown during checkout but discounted to Rs 5. Both Swiggy and Zomato also impose surge charges during peak times. The potential for further fee increases has raised concerns among restaurants, which have requested reductions in high commission rates. Business Standard reported that many restaurants believe fees could rise to Rs 10-15 per order, aligning with global market trends.
For consumers, the increase in platform fees means higher out-of-pocket expenses for food deliveries. As these fees are a controlled revenue source for the companies, they significantly impact the cost structure of online food orders.
The recent fee hikes are expected to affect the cost of online food orders, making them more expensive compared to dining in restaurants. This increase in platform fees is part of a broader effort by Swiggy and Zomato to enhance their unit economics and overall profitability.
The decision by Swiggy and Zomato to raise their platform fees to Rs 6 is part of a strategy to increase revenue amidst rising operational costs. As the companies continue to adjust their fees, consumers may see higher prices for online food orders, and future increases could further impact the cost of using these
delivery services

"Quick fashion on quick commerce? Instamart, Blinkit in talks with top apparel brands",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-fashion-on-quick-commerce-instamart-blinkit-in-talks-with-top-apparel-brands/articleshow/111866284.cms,19-07-2024,"Quick commerce
platforms like
Zomato
’s
Blinkit
and
Swiggy Instamart
are in advanced talks with leading apparel and shoe manufacturers like
Arvind Fashions
,
Fabindia
,
Woodland
and
Puma
to sell their products to capitalise on a large section of consumers in top 15 cities moving to buy products other than groceries through quick commerce, multiple industry executives said.
Fabindia has already finalised terms with
Instamart
whereby a tenth of the unsold stock will be taken back by the apparel manufacturer, and there will be a no-return policy for consumers. Others like Woodland are negotiating for store-return.
Quick commerce firms currently do not have any return policy for products sold through their platform. These startups are hoping to exploit the growing fashion business, which is currently the second-largest selling category in India's e-commerce industry after electronics and smartphones, accounting for around 20-25% of sales. Quick commerce companies are also foraying into electronics and smartphones as ET recently reported.
An executive said
Arvind Fashions
, which sells brands like Arrow, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and US Polo Assn, is in talks to sell innerwear and accessories like socks and belts through quick commerce. Puma, which sold jerseys during IPL through Zepto, is likely to expand the partnership to other products, he said. Currently, at the most, these platforms refund money for products with manufacturing defects.
Quick commerce firms are also negotiating to link retail store inventory across locations on their platforms to offer a wider product assortment and avoid the logistical challenge of keeping entire stocks in dark stores since apparel would occupy much more space due to variety, sizes and fits. Such deliveries may also take longer than 10-15 minutes as is the norm currently with quick commerce, executives said.

However, basic and fast-selling products like innerwear, socks, belts, white shirts, solid colour t-shirts, kurta, black trousers, blue jeans, black formal shoes, school shoes, clogs, home slippers or walking sneakers would be stocked in dark stores so they can be delivered in 10-15 minutes, the executives said.
Woodland India chief executive Harkirat Singh said consumers are increasingly showing a propensity for instant delivery, and quick commerce can become big in fashion as well with already 30% of the company’s sales coming from e-commerce.
In fact, the quick commerce platforms have recently made a soft-launch of fashion products. Swiggy Instamart is selling innerwear and basic colour t-shirts of Jockey and Adidas, while Blinkit is selling t-shirt, innerwear, track pants, some footwear, ethnic wear of Jockey, Pepe, Adidas and Manyavar. Zepto too has started selling Adidas and Jockey products. There is no return on these products.
Anupam Bansal, director, retail, at shoemaker Liberty said the company plans to sell basic products and not fashion wear through quick commerce, that too only on pre-paid mode to ensure chances of return are low.
“Fulfilment would be a challenge because at the end of the day, the fulfilment is happening either through the existing store network where they use only their pickup points, or they will invest in their warehouses to be able to do that commitment of 10 minutes which in the footwear industry is slightly more complicated. So, we want to sell very small merchandise like school shoes, chappals and basic shoes,” he said.
Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto, Fabindia, Arvind Fashions and Puma didn’t respond to ET’s email queries till filing of this story.
Even in grocery and fast-moving consumer goods categories, quick commerce has become the fastest growing channel for large companies like
Hindustan Unilever
,
ITC
,
Nestle
, Parle Products and
Adani Wilmar
, accounting for 30-35% of their total e-commerce sales in FY24.

Tata-owned Infiniti Retail reports Rs 15.89 crore profit in FY24,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tata-owned-infiniti-retail-reports-rs-15-89-crore-profit-in-fy24/articleshow/111786785.cms,16-07-2024,"Tata

Infiniti Retail
, which sells electronic products and

on
Tata Neu
shopping app,
Croma
shopping portal apart from running Croma chain of electronic stores, said
online sales
fell by a quarter in the last financial year as the company ""reset its strategy to avoid competing for sales with negative contribution margins.""
Industry executives said this reflects a reduction in online discounting which Croma would earlier often do to compete with bigger ecommerce rivals like Amazon and Flipkart.
ET recently reported about Tata Sons’ focus on improving profitability of the group’s online businesses. The Tata group parent didn’t infuse fresh capital in any of the online entities including Infiniti Retail last fiscal.
Latest filings by Infiniti Retail to Registrar of Companies (RoC), accessed through business intelligence platform Tofler, showed efforts by the company has helped it to achieve EBITDA breakeven and positive operating cash flow in FY24.
The company reported Rs 15.89 crore profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and other comprehensive income in FY24 compared to a loss of Rs 401.52 crore in the previous fiscal.
Live Events
Infiniti Retail attributed this to “significant improvement in efficiency parameters by utilising the operating leverage that comes with scale.” It said the pricing strategy was redesigned and multiple initiatives were rolled out to uplift operating margins and reduce overhead costs.
Infiniti Retail also limited the rise in net losses in FY24. Net loss during the year widened 3% to Rs 986.7 crore, compared to more than doubling in FY23. Total income rose over 12% to Rs 18,009.4 crore in FY24.
Electronics
and smartphones are the largest revenue generators for Indian e-commerce platforms accounting for 45-50% of total sales.
Infiniti Retail said India’s electronics market growth moderated to 8% in FY24 after two years of robust expansion. The company’s same store growth was flat last year due to a mix of high base effect of 45% growth in FY23 and easing demand.
The company currently runs 490 Croma stores across the country, including a record 149 new stores opened in FY24. It is also expanding into smaller markets.
Infiniti Retail said it is aiming for rapid growth this financial year “leveraging
operating efficiency
measures to target profitability amidst prevailing
macroeconomic challenges
.”
Infiniti Retail managing director Avijit Mitra didn’t respond to email queries.
Infiniti Retail is a subsidiary of
Tata Digital
– the holding company for all the consumer facing e-commerce businesses of the Tata group. Tata Digital is also the holding company for Tata Unistore (which runs Tata Cliq), Innovative Retail Concepts (BigBasket) and Tata 1MG Healthcare Solutions.

Shoppers Stop
, India’s oldest department store chain, plans to enter luxury retailing with large-format standalone stores that will sell brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton, one person aware of the company’s plans told ET.
The new format will also house the
Aditya Birla Group
’s luxury store
The Collective
, the person said.
The company plans to launch two luxury outlets this fiscal year and one of them could be in Kolkata, the other in Mumbai, the person said.
Shoppers Stop declined to comment. Since its inception over three decades ago, Shoppers Stop has been mostly selling merchandise for the masstige or bridge-to-luxury segment. The decision to foray into luxury retailing comes amid a spike in the number of wealthy people in the country. “For us, premiumisation is not just selling luxury products…but (if) a person who used to buy from the roadside has now started buying from the mall, (that) is also a premiumisation,”
Kavindra Mishra

“People are upgrading and this is happening across segments,” said Mishra.
Reliance and the Aditya Birla Group are the existing major players in luxury retailing in the country, having partnered with over 50 luxury brands.
“The biggest challenge for luxury brands is availability of retail space,” said Shriram PM Monga, cofounder of retail consultancy firm SRED. “Most of these (luxury) brands have this clause of presence of similar brands to create a luxury retail environment in order to not compromise on the customer experience. In India, there are only a few malls dedicated to luxury brands but the market is huge,” he said.
As per a Bain & Co report, India’s overall luxury market is expected to reach $85-90 billion by 2030, propelled by a rising number of ultrahigh-net-worth individuals (with net assets of $30 million or more), growing entrepreneurship, a strong middle class, greater penetration of ecommerce, and demand from tier-2 and -3 cities.
The premium and bridge to luxury fashion market in the country is currently valued at $7.86 billion. Global luxury brands are bullish on the Indian market and are eager to enter and expand in the country, the report said.
Shoppers Stop is targeting 55% contribution from premium brands in the current fiscal, up from 47% in FY24.
During the last fiscal, Shoppers Stop reported a 3% growth in revenue, largely led by non-apparel segments, particularly beauty and home categories, and store expansion.
According to its annual report, the company’s strategic emphasis on premiumisation, evidenced by its focus on premium products and expanded store network, aligns with industry trends towards more discretionary and luxury spending.
With 55 new stores opened in 2023-24, Shoppers Stop has invested significantly in footprint expansion, with a capital expenditure of Rs 246 crore.
Additionally, it renovated 13 stores, including seven department stores, five beauty stores, and one HomeStop, bringing 71% of its department stores under its new brand identity.

Reliance Retail's gearing up to do a Decathlon,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retails-gearing-up-to-do-a-decathlon/articleshow/111587097.cms,09-07-2024,"Reliance Retail
is planning to launch a
sports format
that will compete directly with French retailer
Decathlon
in a bid to cash in on the surge in
athleisure products
post the Covid-19 pandemic, three people aware of the development said.
The company is in talks to lease 8,000-10,000 sq ft space across malls and high streets in top cities for the new brand, the name for which has not been disclosed yet, they said. ""While Reliance Retail has expanded a lot in the last few years, sports is something which was missing from the portfolio,"" one of them said. ""India also needs a retailer in the sports category who can compete with
global giants
. The category has shown a lot of growth and is expected to grow further.""
Reliance Retail did not respond to the email query till press time on Monday. According to a
mall operator
, the company is looking for space that can be expanded to outside of the mall where it can have a play area as well - a model followed by Decathlon.
Decathlon, which opened its first store in India in 2009, reported ₹3,955 crore revenue in FY23, up from ₹2,936 crore in FY22 and ₹2,079 crore in FY21, according to regulatory filings sourced from the Registrar of Companies.
Live Events
Sales of leading sports brands have sprinted in the past two years, driven by increasing awareness about fitness and surging demand for athleisure wear.
Brands such as Puma, Decathlon, Adidas, Skechers and Asics have all grown 35-60% year-on-year since FY21, posting combined revenues of ₹11,617 crore in FY23, according to regulatory filings sourced from the Registrar of Companies. Two years ago, these brands had sales of ₹5,022 crore put together.
Decathlon is also in discussions with the Indian government for allowing it to sell products from rival local and global brands in its stores, in effect operating as a multi-brand retailer.
Globally, rival brands account for a fifth of Decathlon's revenue but in India, everything from running shoes to mountaineering equipment is sold under its own labels, in line with the FDI rules. ""India is one of the biggest markets for these companies and a bigger store format on the line of Decathlon can be a game changer,"" one of the persons cited above said. ""Brands have capitalised on the popularity of more casual styles in the wake of the pandemic.""
With a population of 1.4 billion, India is one of the fastest growing and largest international markets for sportswear and footwear companies. Most global brands have been around for more than two decades in India and have grown by virtue of pushing their wares partnering cricket and other sporting activities.

“It has come to our notice through our members that this scheme is being exploited by fraudsters and individuals within the system to facilitate cash funding by involving individuals looking out for loans at a cheaper rate of interest in the loan process,” said a letter written by the Organised Retailer Association to TVS Credit, a non-banking financial company which facilitates loans to purchase
mobile phones
. ET has seen a copy of the letter.
“The fraudulent activities involve customers obtaining Apple products through the 24/0 scheme, selling these products back to fraudsters at a lower price, and subsequently raising false complaints of non-receipt or non-financing of the phones,” the letter added.
According to industry executives, Apple is aware of the issue, but have not received much evidence of cases of fraud from retailers themselves to further investigate. They claimed that even if there is a widespread occurrence of loan frauds, frauds on iPhones are a small percentage.
TVS Credit and Apple did not respond to ET’s queries.
ORA represents large-format retail stores such as Sangeetha Mobiles, Poorvika, BigC and others.
It further said that it is working with All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA), which has 1.5 lakh mobile small retailers across the country.
In its letter, ORA said there were instances where individuals looking for loans at cheaper rates of interest are roped in by fraudsters to obtain financing. Installment schemes for smartphones typically carry a nominal rate of interest.
These financed products are then sold back to fraudsters at a lower price, who subsequently resell them in the grey market. After a period, these buyers falsely claim they never received the product in a bid to avoid repayment, putting the reputation of retailers at stake.
Retailers said 10-12% of all purchases made using financing schemes are fraudulent, which results in financial losses, grey market sales, retailers being banned by NBFCs and customers ending up with locked handsets.
“As a result, store managers are often threatened or confronted by the police when products are not delivered to consumers who were fraudulently granted loans,” the retail association said.
ORA president TS Sridhar told ET that NBFCs have been made aware of the issues but they continue to collect money from stores by threatening to block their access to credit schemes.
To curb such instances of fraud, retailers have demanded that long-term loans with zero down payments should be eliminated. In its place short-term loans of 10, 12 or 15-month tenure with adequate down payment should be brought in to restrict fraud.
They have also urged mobile phone brands to lock devices upon non-payment of loans, along with open-box delivery documented with video or photos.

"Once rebuffed, a Chinese company finds the Ambani route to India",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/once-rebuffed-a-chinese-company-finds-the-ambani-route-to-india/articleshow/111483826.cms,04-07-2024,"When it is facing heat in the US and Europe, a Chinese affordable fashion giant is headed to India, potentially a mammoth market for its cheap clothes. Four years ago, India banned
Shein
from selling products on its own app as part of a larger crackdown on Chinese apps following escalated border conflicts between the two countries.
Now, Shein has found a safe route to India: Mukesh Ambani's
Reliance
Retail Ventures, which will launch the Chinese fast-fashion label in the coming few weeks, ET has reported based on information from sources. Ambani's company will sell Shein's products on its app as well as offline stores owned and operated by Reliance Retail.
It seems a safe India entry for Shein because this time the ownership and control of the platform will remain with Reliance Retail's subsidiary; the platform will be hosted on infrastructure in India; and all platform data will remain in India, which Shein will not have access to, or rights over, ET has reported based on information from sources.
Since Shein might face curbs in the US and Europe, its India entry will support its global leadership in the fast fashion market. Shein has emerged as a major threat for Zara and H&M in the market for cheap clothing and accessories. Shein sits over nearly a fifth of the fast-fashion retail market, with a thin lead over Zara owner Inditex and a wide gap with H&M. In India, it will compete with the likes on Myntra.
The rise of Shein
Founded by Chinese entrepreneur Chris Xu in 2012, Shein has since grown into a global fashion marketplace, serving customers in more than 150 countries and employing more than 11,000 people, according to its website. It has a global presence across over 150 countries and over 250 million followers on social media. The retailer clocked more than $2 billion in profits for 2023 and close to $45 billion in gross merchandise value,

Churning out thousands of new designs a day, Shein has a direct-selling model that targets its millions of social-media followers and makes heavy use of influencers and discount codes. Known for its $10 tops and $5 biker shorts, Shein has a portfolio of 10 brands including Romwe, MOTF and Cuccoo.
Shein produces clothing in
China
to sell online in the US, Europe and Asia excluding China. It does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and instead works with around 5,400 third-party contract manufacturers, mainly in China. It uses an on-demand manufacturing system that allows it to quickly boost production of popular items and drop products that do not sell as expected. The process helps improve production speed and inventory management. Shein says the approach has helped it consistently achieve average unsold inventory rates in the low single digits.
Facing heat in the US and Europe
Critics of Shein and other Chinese e-tailers in the US have complained that it uses import tax exemption there to undercut rivals and avoid customs inspections of their products.
Shein ships the majority of its products directly from China to shoppers by air in individually addressed packages. Its strategy helped the firm avoid unsold inventory piling up in warehouses and avoid import tax in the US, one of its biggest markets, as it allows the e-tailer to take advantage of the ""de minimis"" provision that exempts cheap products from tariffs.
The tax provision is now under growing congressional scrutiny, with critics saying it allowing the companies to evade higher tariffs on Chinese goods. The decades-old tariff exemption for packages valued at $800 or less is open to all retailers but is most heavily used by Chinese firms including Shein.
Its online only sales strategy has helped it keep overheads down, but growing wait times - up to two weeks or more to receive goods in the US - has put it at a disadvantage against rivals such as Target, Walmart and Amazon. It is now sending more low-priced apparel and home goods to US warehouses to speed up shipping times, according to trade analysis firm ImportGenius.
After Shein's increasing scrutiny in the US, now the European Union (EU) is drawing up plans to impose customs duties on cheap goods bought from Chinese online retailers including Shein, the Financial Times has reported recently.
The European Commission later this month will suggest scrapping a current 150 euros ($161) threshold under which items can be bought duty free, the report said. Under current EU regulations, packages purchased online from a non-EU country are not subject to customs duties if their value is under 150 euros.
Shein had to reportedly shelve its plans for an IPO in New York as it faced regulatory hurdles and pushback from US lawmakers. It had filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in November.
While Shein still prefers New York as its listing venue and reportedly plans to keep its application alive in case there is a change in the stance of US regulators, it is now gearing up for a London IPO. It has confidentially filed papers with Britain's markets regulator in early June, Reuters reported based on information from sources. It may also pursue a secondary US listing in New York following its London IPO when it deems the U.S. political climate to be more favorable. Shein was valued at $66 billion in a fundraising round last year,

"Reliance Industries Invests Rs 4,330 cr in Retail Unit in FY24",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-industries-invests-rs-4330-cr-in-retail-unit-in-fy24/articleshow/111467733.cms,04-07-2024,"Reliance Industries
infused Rs 4,330 crore into its flagship
retail
company
Reliance Retail
in the last financial year, showed Reliance Retail's latest regulatory disclosure to the ministry of corporate affairs. The investment leveraged both equity and debt, marking a shift from FY23 when it was funded entirely via debt.
RIL made the funding through its wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures (
RRVL
), which is also the holding company for all retail businesses of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate. The disclosure showed Reliance Retail has transferred its supply chain assets to
Reliance Logistics and Warehouse Holdings
(RLWH) at a valuation of Rs 8,000 crore. The proposal was approved by Reliance Retail's board in March.
Analysts said the move will allow the group to further unlock value from supply chain assets after Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and KKR's recent investments in RLWH, as ET reported last month. RRVL had set up an infra investment trust (InvIT) last year to house about half of its retail warehousing assets. Subsequently, earlier this year, the holding company transferred some more warehousing assets to RLWH.
""Reliance Retail is looking to unlock value from strategic assets to ease pressure on cash flow while at the same time capturing the value by long-term leasing arrangements,"" said Mohit Yadav, founder at business intelligence firm AltInfo. ""This move is in continuance of the earlier InvIT and seems to capture smaller assets that were not allowed to be part of InvIT,"" he said. Reliance Retail didn't respond to ET's queries.

Tier 2 and tier 3 regions comprised 65 per cent of overall video commerce engagement, mostly in categories like fashion, beauty, personal care, home decor and furnishing. The maximum viewership clocked on a single live commerce video was 1.4 million, it added.
""Video as a format is rapidly gaining adoption, especially among women in tier 2 and tier 3 regions, millennials and the Gen Z audience pan India. The top 5 cities leading the way for Flipkart's Video Commerce engagement are NCR, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata,"" the e-commerce major said.
Three main reasons why customers primarily from below the 30 year age group and tier 2 and tier 3 regions flock to this format are relatability, trust, ease of access and interactivity, Flipkart said, adding that direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, sellers and farmers also see value in video commerce offerings.

Titan Eye+ to resume expansion strategy amid growing eyewear market,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/titan-eye-to-resume-expansion-strategy-amid-growing-eyewear-market/articleshow/111289086.cms,26-06-2024,"Eyewear retailer
Titan Eye+ will shift focus back to network expansion from the quarter beginning July, Saumen Bhaumik, CEO of Eyecare Division at
Titan Company
, told ET. The retailer had focused on strengthening existing stores rather than opening new ones last year.

Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
“We are building a business venture, which is profitable by design and which is what we established for the last four years. We accelerated our network expansion in the previous two and a half years. We took a pause last year and we are more or less at the same level right now,” he said.
The retail brand, which is an arm of Titan, currently has more than 900 stores in the country, across around 350 cities. In fiscal year 2023-24, the brand recorded earnings of Rs 707 crore, with a growth rate of 5%.
The company had stepped into the
luxury eyewear
space in August last year. This year the company is opening
retail store
Runway for premium sunglasses on Friday. “Right now, our current share through our own brands, as well as the international brands that we sell is around 10% or less in
premium eyewear
. We are trying to go beyond that with the launch of these new retail stores, just like we have done in watches in the other lifestyle segments,” he said.
The premium segment, however, is not yet a significant contributor to the eyewear company’s overall topline, he added. “When you are building a brand for a segment, it has to go through the rigour of delivering exceptional value and for the quality and comfort that it stands for. So, we are not in a rush. We can take it to Rs 500 crore eventually, and increase distribution, but that is not what we are planning to do right now,” he said.

"KwikChat to power over 5000 eCommerce brands globally, aims four-fold revenues increase",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/kwikchat-to-power-over-5000-ecommerce-brands-globally-aims-four-fold-revenues-increase/articleshow/111279775.cms,26-06-2024,"KwikChat
, a
whatsapp
commerce solution by
eCommerce
enabler
GoKwik
, said it aims to increase its revenue fourfold and powering over 5000
brands
and 3 billion conversations in the next six months.
GoKwik launched KwikChat in June last year following the acquisition of the WhatsApp commerce platform
Tellephant
. The solution enables brands to engage with target shoppers, ensuring higher
ROI
on marketing campaigns, better-abandoned checkout recoveries and greater repeat purchases.
“This past year has been transformative for KwikChat. We acquired Tellephant with a strategic vision of bridging the gap from conversations to conversions for eCommerce brands. This has shown immense value and we’ve now geared up to take it to the next level. As not just acquiring but consistently engaging and retaining shoppers grows in importance, KwikChat is heading towards becoming the go-to engagement platform across all channels. With our DNA committed to solving everything eCommerce, we are excited about the vision we have for the next phase of KwikChat’s growth“ said Chirag Taneja, co-founder and CEO of GoKwik
Within a year of inception, KwikChat has helped brands maximize their ROI on WhatsApp campaigns by 20 times, increased engagement across acquisition, retention, and support communications by three times, and continued to enable growth for these brands.
KwikChat started as a WhatsApp solution but has expanded its offerings to instagram, facebook, SMS, and Email.

""We have been one of the early adopters of KwikChat, and our experience with the product has been phenomenal. We witnessed a rise in conversions by up to 2.5 times and a 12% rise in abandoned checkout recoveries owing to some of KwikChat’s remarkable features. We are excited to see the evolution of this product and how it enables a personalised experience for shoppers, one they prefer,” said Romita Mazumdar, Founder of Foxtale

"Reliance Retail sets the ball rolling on delivery in an hour, starts pilot service in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-sets-the-ball-rolling-on-delivery-in-an-hour-starts-pilot-service-in-mumbai-navi-mumbai/articleshow/111267257.cms,26-06-2024,"Kolkata:
Reliance Retail
has started the pilot of immediate
delivery
of groceries and fast-moving consumer goods (
FMCG
) products in certain areas of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai where orders will be fulfilled within an hour, a senior industry executive told ET.
The group's fast-delivery service has been integrated into the
Jiomart
mobile application as a 'hyperlocal delivery' option. Reliance will try to reduce the delivery time to 30-45 minutes as more stores get linked into the system and the operation expands into other markets, the executive said. According to industry executives, Reliance's shortest delivery time for orders of daily necessities placed online is about 12 hours. Some orders can even take up to three days.
An email query sent to Reliance Retail remained unanswered as of press time.
Quick commerce companies like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Zepto and BB Now from Tata-owned BigBasket are delivering most orders within 10 minutes. Reliance doesn't want to enter the delivery race as that would require setting up higher penetration of dark stores and hiring a large fleet of delivery personnel. Instead, it will be fulfilling these orders from its store network and warehouses.

The executive cited earlier said that in areas where its store network is limited, Reliance is planning to rope in the kirana stores that have joined the JioMart Partner initiative. These kiranas source products from Reliance Retail's wholesale arm and have their backend connected.
The company is utilising technology platforms such as FYND and Locus for the fulfilment process and to optimise delivery routes. There's also a plan to go hyperlocal with apparel and electronic items at a later stage, the executive said. For its re-entry into quick commerce, the company has formed an inter-departmental team comprising Reliance Retail's chief executive for grocery business, Damodar Mall, and JioMart's chief executive Sandeep Varaganti. The team will be expanded later as more categories get added. Last year, Reliance shelved its quick-commerce pilot - JioMart Express - in Navi Mumbai. This time round, it has not used any specific branding.

food etailing
businesses these days in the wake of stepped-up checks at stores and warehouses amid rising cases of contamination.
E-commerce platforms have ramped up product checks in their dark stores and warehouses to find out about and avert food contamination, ToI reported on June 24. According to the report (by Asmita Dey), a big supply chain churn could on the cards as a number of platforms are preparing to change policies and 'delist' sellers that get caught breaching safety protocols.
Zepto
, a
quick commerce
firm that recently drew a lot of ire over the much-publicised finger-in-icecream case, is now considering a recall policy for contaminated products identified by consumers.
""As platforms, we have zero visibility into the manufacturing processes of FMCG brands. Such episodes of food contamination reflect lapses on the manufacturing side of the brands. The onus is on them. We try our best to comply with the quality parameters that are under our control,"" the CEO of an online platform told ToI on condition of anonymity. Zepto did not comment.
Another executive from an online firm explained that once a product is sealed, platforms cannot control its quality.

""We already have a policy in place wherein we delist sellers if we find any serious lapses on their part. That's the toughest step we can take and if required, we will do that,"" added the executive.
Brands themselves are also taking steps to tighten vigilance on their manufacturing processes to prevent food contamination. iD Fresh Food plans to deploy AI cameras in its manufacturing plants for better inspection.
""Food contamination usually happens at the factory level and in certain cases, it can also occur when the storage is improper. We have quality inspectors who do the due diligence but with AI cameras, the process will be strengthened,"" said P C Musthafa, global CEO and co-founder at iD Fresh Food, the maker of idli, dosa batter, parathas, and chapatis.
Hershey's India, after being scrutinized for a customer’s claim of discovering a dead mouse in its chocolate syrup, emphasized that it conducts multiple quality checks on every product before it reaches consumers.
""We have investigated these reports and verified all our food safety and production processes. We are confident that we have the right measures in place to ensure food safety and this kind of alleged contamination is not possible,"" the company stated. They also mentioned that they received no response from the customer despite repeated attempts to establish contact, suggesting that the claim may not be ""legitimate.""

"RAI's Budget wishlist: Lower taxes for individuals, benefits on land rates, electricity",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/rais-budget-wishlist-lower-taxes-for-individuals-benefits-on-land-rates-electricity/articleshow/111165214.cms,21-06-2024,"The Retailers Association of India (RAI) on Friday called for
lower taxes
for
individuals
to generate demand and spur consumption besides seeking low-cost finance, subsidies and
benefits
on
land rates
and necessities such as electricity for retailers ahead of
Union Budget
FY25. Retailing in India accounts for about 10 per cent of the country's GDP and the sector is second only to agriculture in terms of the number of people directly employed, RAI said in its pre-Budget memorandum highlighting areas that need attention in order to make the industry stronger.
""To ensure the growth of the sector, the Union Budget for FY25 should focus on generating demand and spurring consumption by offering benefits or concessions in the form of lower taxes,"" RAI said.
It will boost the overall consumer sentiment and benefit the retail sector, it said adding, consumption equals to development and the ""tax benefits and relief to individual taxpayers will increase the monthly disposable income and support consumption"".
Further, the budget should outline supportive policies, simplified regulations, skill development and simple goods and services tax (GST) norms to aid the development of the retail industry, RAI said.
Asking for low-cost finance to retailers, the industry body said,""There is a need to provide lower interest rate to the retailers through the special announcement in the Budget to assure easier financing for the retail businesses.""

It also asked the government to consider the food and beverages retail sector as an essential service and said ""subsidies and benefits should be given on land rates and other necessities such as electricity"".
RAI also said there is a need to expedite the formulation and implementation of 'National Retail Policy' to enable ease of doing business and ""such a step would provide a substantial boost to the retail sector"".
Stating that benefits to retail and wholesale trade MSMEs are restricted to priority sector lending only, RAI also recommended that retail and wholesale traders should be eligible for all benefits available to other MSMEs.
Further, the retailers' body asked the Centre to encourage and incentivise states to adopt 'The Model Shops and Establishment (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Services) Act 2016 that enables states to choose to keep shops and other such establishments open 24X7 all through the year.

retail chains

As per investor documents, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail-owned departmental chain Pantaloons store count came down from 431 in FY23 to 417 in FY24. Last quarter itself, Pantaloons closed 33 stores which it says is to “improve quality of its network.” Spencer's total store count dropped from 151 in FY23 to 133 in FY24 after the retailer exited “non-strategic geographies” in the South. Gourmet retailer Nature’s Basket’s store count was reduced by one in the last fiscal.
V-Mart Retail opened nine new stores in January to March quarter but closed 19 under-performing stores. Tata-owned eye care retail chain Titan Eye+ had a net closure of 8 stores in the last quarter.

V-Mart Retail managing director Lalit Agarwal said retailers had experimented and tried multiple things after Covid phase like entry into newer markets and newer formats. “When business is down, it’s time to decide and exit non-performing stores. It’s a healthy way to improve our finances,” he said.

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail managing director Ashish Dikshit told analysts in the fourth quarter earnings call that with demand down, the network rationalization (of Pantaloons) will help to reduce the fixed cost of less profitable stores or unprofitable stores. The Pantaloons closures were mainly of the stores it had opened in smaller towns and of small sizes. It has now decided to focus on larger towns.
The
store closures
come in the backdrop of rapid expansion by retail chains in FY22 and FY23 when demand was also robust led by pent up sales of Covid and revenge shopping.
Demand nosedived across categories from November 2022 and while retailers have said there was some recovery in this March, it got again impacted during April-May due to general elections when stores were shut for seven days and high summer heat which impacted footfalls. Retailers also reduced their pace of opening new stores last fiscal to the slowest in the last five years.
Spencer’s Retail Ltd chief executive Anuj Singh told analysts last month that the store closures did impact the top line last fiscal. “I think what we did further was in quarter four, which is in January, we did review the organization, both at the corporate office as well as the regional offices and the stores, and we have initiated that exercise. That is the one which will yield us additional substantial cost advantage as we get into this year,” he said.
Most of the retailers said the large scale store closures are mostly one-time and they would now recoup back into ‘measured’ expansion mode from this fiscal.
Sameer Manglani, owner of Meena Bazaar, said whatever growth is happening is due to the store opening.
“Same store sales growth is muted but we will continue to open one store every month as we have been doing. Mall needs to support retailers as growth in sales will ultimately lead to increase in revenue for the mall,” he said.

"Stop, thief! Retail giants are facing a new 'lifting' problem - not just from customers, but also staff & vendors",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/stop-thief-retail-in-a-spot-as-customers-go-big-on-stocktaking/articleshow/111006169.cms,15-06-2024,"Kolkata | New Delhi:
Indian retail
is increasingly bedevilled by shrinkage or the loss of inventory due to
shoplifting
by customers,
theft
by employees, vendor fraud and supply chain errors. As a percentage of sales, shrinkage has risen at
retail
chains in India with industry executives attributing this to the rise in thefts amid growth in sales volumes.
Tata-owned
Trent Ltd
said in its annual report that shrinkage swelled to 0.41% of sales in FY24 from 0.22% in FY23, primarily due to significant volume growth. In FY20, it was 0.21% and had actually come down to 0.19% in FY22. Trent's sales volumes have almost doubled year-on-year in FY22, FY23 and FY24. Trent owns the Westside and Zudio chains.
At
V-Mart Retail
, this has gone up from 0.4% in FY23 to 0.5% in FY24.
""Shrinkage has gone up in the industry and has become a whole new challenge,"" said V-Mart Retail managing director Lalit Agarwal. ""Whenever business goes up, it tends to go up. Also, the new generation wants more even when times are tough. We try to ensure it remains under control.""
The All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA), which represents cellphone retail stores, said several of the large and regional retail chains have reported a surge in shrinkage, mostly by employees. While five years back, it used to be around ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh per month for the retail chains, it's now around ₹5-10 lakh per month, AIMRA chairman Kailash Lakhyani said.
Live Events
Shrinkage goes up during events such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the festive season when some employees try to make a quick buck by selling store inventory in the grey market, at times to fund bets, Lakhyani said.
""Retailers file police complaints and claim insurance, but still it's a pain,"" he said.
Interestingly, shrinkage disclosures by most Indian retailers - including listed ones - are something of a taboo for them unlike their western counterparts.
Highest in Apparel, Shoes and Fashion
Devangshu Dutta, chief executive at Third Eyesight, a retail sector consultancy, said shrinkage is an operational reality and a cost which retailers monitor very closely.
""However, they may not publicly disclose the numbers if it reflects poorly on their operational controls and security. Shrinkage goes up when there is economic tightening and high inflation as India has gone through in the last couple of years,"" he said.
Shrinkage is the highest in apparel, shoes and fashion categories, retailers said, followed by gadgets like mobile phones, smartwatches and headphones where the risk-reward ratio is higher due to small pack sizes and the high value of the goods.
Cracking Down
Retailers are going in for stricter audits to rein in such losses. Cellphone and electronic stores have started doing them on a daily basis. Shoe retailer Woodland has set up local audit teams, unlike the centralised ones earlier, so that shrinkage can remain under control at 0.2% of sales, said chief executive Harkirat Singh.
If it goes out of control, staff can get penalised. ""Shrinkage beyond a certain limit is realised from the store team,"" Singh added.
Still, Retailers Association of India chief executive Kumar Rajagopalan said shrinkage till 0.5% of sales is manageable as globally it is 1.5-2%.
""We are not yet at the alarming stage. In India, the return rate of a product is high and sometimes those products are not in the condition to be sold again, adding to the burden,"" he said. RAI is a grouping of organised retailers.
In a 2023 retail security survey by the US-based industry body National Retail Federation, the average shrink rate in 2022 increased to 1.6% from 1.4% in 2021. That represented $112.1 billion in losses in 2022, up from $93.9 billion in 2021.

"DPIIT officials, Flipkart, toy makers to meet on Wednesday on ways to increase sourcing",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/dpiit-officials-flipkart-toy-makers-to-meet-on-wednesday-on-ways-to-increase-sourcing/articleshow/110917311.cms,11-06-2024,"New Delhi: Senior officials from the Commerce and Industry Ministry,
Walmart
group firm
Flipkart
and domestic toy makers will discuss on Thursday ways to increase sourcing and immediate onboarding of manufacturers on the
e-commerce platform
, an industry official said. The official said that to make India a global manufacturing hub for toys, the government has undertaken a series of initiatives, and in this context, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), in collaboration with Flipkart, is organising this workshop to enhance India's position and capabilities in the global toy supply chain.
""This shall help in upskilling/reskilling the domestic workforce to produce innovative and high-quality toys,"" the official added.
The US-based retail giant Walmart is looking to source toys from Indian suppliers as the company is targeting to increase its exports from India to USD 10 billion annually by 2027.
Last year, the company informed toy makers about their requirements and expected quality standards, as it is directly engaging with domestic toymakers for sourcing.
""The objective of the workshop or hackathon is to help domestic players increase their presence on Flipkart's platform and exports from the country,"" the official noted.
Live Events
The main points which could figure in the workshop include information regarding the toys category; details of recent trends in the toys market; experience of existing manufacturers with Flipkart; details of central support pertaining to Flipkart toy team handholding, registration for new account and onboarding of Indian manufacturers.
When asked about the hackathon, Flipkart Group Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Rajneesh Kumar said that through the Flipkart marketplace, the company have been able to provide local
toy manufacturers
a platform to reach customers across India thereby supporting their growth.
""We are happy to support DPIIT, Ministry of Commerce's efforts to help strengthen the toy industry in India and accelerate India's development as a global toy manufacturing and export hub. This workshop and hackathon will help all participating stakeholders identify opportunities to achieve this goal of the government,"" Kumar added.
Another industry official said that e-commerce platforms are revolutionising toy retail in India as they offer a wider selection of toys compared to physical stores, making them a one-stop shop for parents.
These online platforms provide greater access to a much wider customer base across India, expanding their market reach significantly.
E-commerce eliminates the need for physical stores, reducing operational costs. It also provides valuable brand exposure to a large audience. Additionally, e-commerce platforms offer data on consumer buying habits and preferences, allowing manufacturers to develop products that cater to market demands.
India's toy exports declined marginally to USD 152.34 million in 2023-24 from USD 153.89 million in the previous financial year, according to a report by economic think tank GTRI.
The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said India's toy exports did not benefit much from the mandatory quality control orders.
In contrast, India's share in the global toy export market is minimal, totalling USD 167 million, which represents only 0.3 per cent of the global exports, ranking it 27th, the GTRI report has said.
India raised import duties on toys beginning in February 2020. The basic customs duty was increased from 20 per cent to 60 per cent and then to 70 per cent in July 2021.

Outside in sweltering heat, Swiggy's bikers, sporting the firm's trademark bright orange T-shirt, frantically collect packed grocery orders to deliver them nearby, while others return to tackle another shipment assigned on their app and waiting.
""Ideally, one needs to get done with the entire (pickup) process in 1 minute 30 seconds,"" warehouse manager Prateek Salunke said.
Swiggy warehouses are mushrooming across India to deliver everything from milk and bananas to condoms and roses within minutes - a business model that is reshaping how Indians shop.
It is also threatening millions of mom-and-pop stores that for decades dominated the grocery trade in a country where big supermarkets are relatively scarce and are located in more affluent neighbourhoods or malls.

Too hot, too good for e-tailers: ACs, ice creams and beauty products' online sales enjoy the heatwave
Indians long relied on visits to small neighbourhood outlets for groceries or got free deliveries from them via phone orders, before the rise of e-commerce triggered by
Amazon
and Walmart's
Flipkart
over the past decade.
But the U.S. giants, which offer location-dependent same-day or next-day delivery, are not as fast with groceries as Swiggy and its rivals Zepto and
Zomato
's Blinkit, which are ushering a ""
quick commerce
"" boom.
Goldman Sachs said in April quick deliveries account for $5 billion, or 45% of India's $11 billion online grocery market currently. As shoppers prioritise convenience and speed, quick commerce will account for 70% of the online grocery market set to touch $60 billion by 2030, it forecast.
IPO-bound Swiggy started as a restaurant food delivery business in 2014 and is valued at $10 billion, but it is now switching gears to bet more on the ""last-minute"" grocery business in India, the world's third-largest
retail
market after China and the United States.

""We are training our guns to focus on a market much larger than food,"" a December 2023 confidential Swiggy strategy document seen by Reuters said of its Instamart service.
Its target? ""21-35 year old, time-starved urban consumers who value convenience"", the document said.
Swiggy did not respond to requests for comment on the document or its broader strategy.
The company doubled its warehouse count to 500 in 25 cities last year and has plans to increase it to 750 before April 2025, said an executive at one of Swiggy's financial investors, which also include Prosus, Qatar Investment Authority and Singapore's
GIC
.
Globally, COVID-19 lockdowns spurred fast-delivery startups, helping the likes of Turkey's Getir to expand, only to see the interest dissipate as shoppers returned to physical outlets after the pandemic. Luxembourg-based Jokr scaled back from the U.S. market in 2022.
India is witnessing a different trend.
Sumat Chopra, a partner at consultancy Kearney, said quick commerce firms were benefiting from availability of cost-effective warehousing space and ""pampered"" Indian consumers' long-time habit of ordering just a few items from neighbourhood stores by phone.
Swiggy will even take an order for a single mango, though it could cost about twice as much as walking to a nearby shop.
Many consumers are willing to pay up to save time.
Mumbai lawyer Natasha Kavalakkat, 27, who has a hectic daily schedule, uses quick delivery apps like Swiggy and Zepto to order apples and bread. She said getting juice packs delivered within minutes just before a party was a game-changer.
""This is too convenient.""
VICTIMS OF THE BOOM
The rise of quick commerce means many smaller retail stores are reeling under pressure.
Suburban Mumbai grocer Prem Patel's business had thrived in recent years, allowing him to refurbish his store and install air conditioning. He's not happy anymore.
""No one buys milk from malls and supermarkets. That was our uniqueness. But these apps have changed the game,"" said Patel, whose daily sales have halved to about 25,000 rupees ($300).
Four retailer associations in four Indian states, representing 90,000 grocery shops of the country's estimated 13 million, told Reuters monthly sales were dropping by 10% to 60% for some due to rise of quick commerce apps.
Some traditional stores are responding by becoming more tech-savvy.
Hiren Gandhi, who chairs a retail association in Gujarat state, has asked members to create WhatsApp groups to take orders and deliver goods quickly in a 6.4-km (4-mile) radius.
""Around 500 stores have taken steps to innovate and sustain their business,"" he said.
HIGH REVENUE, NO PROFITS YET
Swiggy's financials for its Instamart quick commerce division are not public, but the internal document showed its annualised order value trebled from $340 million in December 2021 to $1 billion in September last year. The business is still loss-making, the executive at Swiggy's investor said.
Swiggy's main rival, Zomato, is India's biggest food delivery business but acquired quick commerce company Blinkit in 2022. Goldman Sachs said Blinkit is more valuable to Zomato than food delivery and is forecast to post orders worth $2.7 billion this year, nearly 60% higher than estimated last year.
Zomato, in a May regulatory disclosure, said Blinkit had broken even for the first time, but it expected its operating profit to ""hover around zero for the next few quarters"". It did not respond to a request for further comment.
Analysts warn reliance only on big urban cities to lure customers and high spending on promotional discounts and marketing that keeps profits at bay could prove risky for quick commerce firms in the low-margin groceries business.
But Swiggy and Blinkit are already diversifying beyond groceries into higher-margin products.
On Swiggy's app, shoppers can order fitness products and electronics such as a $132 Xiaomi air purifier, while Blinkit said it sold a record number of roses, bouquets and teddy bears in a single day on Valentine's Day in February.
Swiggy's Instamart was launched as an ""Indian version of 7 Eleven (on the cloud)"", its internal document said, but ""we are changing our positioning"" to an ""online Supermarket"".

"Information overload causing decision stress to consumers, gen AI suggested to improve the shopping experience: Accenture report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/information-overload-causing-decision-stress-to-consumers-gen-ai-suggested-to-improve-the-shopping-experience-accenture-report/articleshow/110877542.cms,10-06-2024,"New Delhi: Information overload with too many choices and being bombarded with
advertising
resulted in 88% of consumers abandoning purchases in the last three months of 2023, according to the latest research report by Accenture.
This challenge in making decisions regarding purchases is not only with bigger items. “Buying snacks is harder than buying the rest of the weekly grocery; buying a moisturizer is on par with buying a washing machine; choosing to buy probiotics is easier than selecting a
loan
and buying any type of beverage is as challenging as booking travel,” Accenture said in a press note released on Monday.
67% of Indian consumers feel that there is no improvement, but rather an increase in the time and effort required to make a purchase decision. Out of these, 40% think that this process has become more difficult, and 28% think that there is no change. 33% of consumers think that the time and effort it takes to make a purchase decision has been reduced, as per the report.
Accenture said brands need to use generative AI to reduce the noise around decision-making and increase engagement, loyalty, and sales. 82% of the Indian respondents from the survey said that they are open to using conversational
gen AI
solutions for supporting, guiding, and recommending them during shopping.
Companies will have to improve how their products and services are marketed, and how shoppers navigate through the noise to make confident purchase decisions, Vineet R Ahuja, managing director and lead of strategy and consulting at Accenture India said.

clothes
,
electronics
and
footwear
that have been enticing shoppers to splurge may reduce significantly, as
retailers
including
Aditya Birla Fashion
and
Retail
(ABFRL),
Arvind
and
V-Mart
have ruled out deep
discounts
in a move to spur
profits
.
Madura Fashion
, which manages brands such as Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly and Peter England, said that during the second half of the previous fiscal, especially the fourth quarter, it managed to reduce discounts by 500 basis points to drive profitable
growth
.
""We also realised that we were quite alright on inventory and we didn't see much elasticity and in discounting,"" Vishak Kumar, chief executive officer at Madura Fashion, told investors. ""We kept that tight and that was part of the cost reduction efforts also."" In FY24, retail
sales
growth rate fell year-on-year every month, reflecting weak consumer sentiment across segments such as apparels, footwear and quick service restaurants (QSR). FY24's comparatively slower growth rate of 4-7% sustained this year as well, with April seeing a 4% increase, the Retailers Association of India (RAI) said after a survey of the country's top 100 retailers.
For the last year and a half, retailers have tried to counter slowing demand with constant discounting. But the price cuts haven't helped much.
Department store V-Mart, which operates in smaller towns, said it has shifted focus to internal capability, which is scalable, replicable and sustainable. ""So, those are certain things that we are trying to do, not putting any kind of steroids in the overall process so that we get certain growth just by giving more value to the customer or giving more discount to the customers,"" Lalit Agarwal, chairman of V-Mart, told analysts. ""We are not acting on any of such thought processes of reducing the gross margins.""
Live Events
As Covid eased, pent-up demand led to a boom in sales across athleisure wear, apparel and lifestyle products.
Consumers
upgraded wardrobes after offices reopened, and eating out and socialising picked up. This led to 13-24% monthly growth throughout FY23.
Shailesh Chaturvedi, managing director at Arvind Fashions, said that after the pandemic, most retailers are moving to a direct-to-consumer model for online sales, which means they control the merchandise, assortment and price instead of ecommerce marketplaces.
""We deliver it at the prices that we want and not heavy discounting, etc. So there's a sort of healthier and long-term business,"" he said during an earnings call.
Bajaj Electricals chief executive Anuj Poddar told analysts last month that discounting is as high as 5-6% in the market in the electronic product categories the company operates in. He said some of this is being pulled back since it is affecting margins, adding that the company recently increased prices. ""We will take a bet that we will take a price hike and, in fact, hopefully not have an adverse volume impact on that, but not all of the 6% can be rolled back right now,"" Poddar said.

Trent plans global retail push after acing it in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/trent-plans-global-retail-push-after-acing-it-in-india/articleshow/110645533.cms,03-06-2024,"Riding the wave of its success in the domestic
retail
market, Noel Tata-led
Trent
is exploring opportunities to set up its retail formats outside Indian shores, beginning with a flagship store in Dubai, said people in the know. This move comes as
Zudio
, one of its flagship brands, surpasses the ₹7,000-crore
revenue
mark in
India
.
Trent had earlier deferred its
global
ambitions to consolidate domestic operations. Now, with a robust and profitable
business
model in place, the traditionally conservative retailer is now seeking to tap the substantial Indian diaspora overseas, becoming the first retailer to do so, the people said. It may consider an international ally for possible partnerships, though that is unconfirmed. Chief executive officer P Venkatesalu said the company, as previously, continues to explore possibilities. ""It is still early to comment on plans,"" he added.
According to industry watchers,
Trent
has cracked a sustainable and profitable business model and has now gained the confidence to scale up abroad.
Trent's consolidated revenue has increased at a five-year compound annual
growth
rate of 45%, reaffirming its growth strategy driven by agile on-ground execution. Amid an apparel slowdown, Trent stands out as an anomaly, consistently delivering positive surprises in both revenue and
profit
margin.
The company reported another strong growth year in FY24, with net sales surging 50% to ₹12,375 crore and net profit rising nearly fourfold to ₹1,477 crore. This robust performance was driven by a combination of strong like-for-like growth, aggressive
expansion
of Zudio stores and significant traction in emerging categories such as beauty and personal care, innerwear, and footwear.

In the March 2024 quarter, its fashion apparel brand
Westside
unit added 12 stores, bringing the total store count to 232, while value fashion concept Zudio opened 86 new stores, taking its total count to 545.
Shares of Trent gained 192% in the last one year and 305% over two years, compared with gains of 10% and 18% in the
Sensex
during the same periods.
Trent was the top performer among all the
Tata Group
stocks during these periods.
The only retailer pursuing an unconventional 'own brands' strategy, Trent had accelerated the expansion of its key formats - Westside, Zudio and
Star Bazaar
.
""Westside and Zudio are like two siblings playing in the fashion space. They vary on product, design, fabric, etc., but are still relevant at different price points. Moreover, the learnings from Westside helped build a strong Zudio model and the backend integration of the two brands is helping both businesses deliver synergistic growth,"" Venkatesalu told
ET
.
Trent's brands are not sold on any other ecommerce websites except Tata platforms (
Tata Neu
and TataCliq). The Zudio format today contributes as much as 30% to total revenue compared with only 8% a few years back.
The retailer is applying the same strategy at the Star Bazaar business in the food and grocery space and is witnessing some very strong customer traction.
It has consistently delivered robust financial results, boasting 31% and 26% compound annual growth rates (CAGR) in revenue and profit, respectively, over the past five years. Trent is now seen by its management team as a platform that allows to originate, incubate and scale a portfolio of growth engines.

retailers

Reliance Retail

Tata's Trent
,
Titan Co and Starbucks
together had 33,219 stores, data sourced from their latest investor presentations showed. In FY23, the number was 30,551 and had climbed 18% from a year ago.
These companies added about 2,700 stores — on average about 7 a day — to their network during the last fiscal year, but that’s nearly half compared to 13 doors each day in FY23.
""The material part, not specific to just this quarter, was the demand side of the business coming down. You saw rationalisation of the network so that it reduces fixed costs of less profitable stores or unprofitable stores,"" Ashish Dikshit, managing director of Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, told investors.
Retail sales growth rate fell year-on-year every month in the previous fiscal, reflecting weak

As a result, most retailers have also shut a lot of unviable stores, a trend expected to continue as companies seek to boost
profitability
.
""We are not being very aggressive, but we are being very mindful and analytical on our approach in terms of trying to open up the stores which can retain and sustain the ROE that we expect and the ROCE that we expect. So, a lot of that work is happening, being very selective in our approach, because the market is getting a little bit corrupted in terms of people, our competitors are trying to give a little more higher rentals and give more favorable terms to the consumers,"" Lalit Agarwal, chairman of hypermarket chain V-Mart, told analysts.
Revenge Shopping
Easing of the pandemic was marked by booming sales across athleisure wear, apparel and lifestyle products, due to pent up demand with consumers upgrading their wardrobes after offices reopened and higher frequency of eating out and socialising. This led to retailers accelerating store launches, with many opening larger stores in marquee properties to cash in the
surging demand
led by revenge shopping.
""We are kind of guiding 700 restaurants by FY 27. We continue to stay put on that. We have always believed and we will always continue to behave that we have to responsibly grow. If in a particular year, we see that maybe moderation on growth rates is required, we will look at those. We don't want a cowboy approach to growth. Responsible, disciplined growth is what we believe in, and we will continue to do that,"" said Rajeev Varman, chief executive officer at Restaurants Brands Asia, which runs Burger King.
The retail sector took 7.1 million square feet of space across top eight cities in 2023, which is expected to dip to 6-6.5 million sq ft in 2024, according to commercial real estate services firm CBRE. Retailers are also focussing on ecommerce, which according to the India Phygital Report 2024, now accounts for 8-10% of the total retail market and would reach 14% by 2026-27. The increase in share was led by an increased active user base between 275-312 million, which could go up to 439 million by 2026-27, said the report.
The India Phygital Report was derived by conducting surveys across 500 stores of 200 brands and analyzed 4.4 million e-commerce transactions across 350 brands. Apparel and accessories accounted for 18.8 % of e-commerce penetration, 6.1 % for home furnishing, but remained dismal at 2.1 percent for jewelry.

Reliance Retail plans 30-minute delivery model for quick commerce re-entry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-plans-30-minute-delivery-model-for-quick-commerce-re-entry/articleshow/110540530.cms,30-05-2024,"Reliance Industries
’ retail arm,
Reliance Retail
will not compete with
Blinkit
and
Zepto
with a 10-minute
delivery model
for its proposed re-entry into
quick commerce
venture next month.
Instead the country’s largest retailer is planning a 30-minute delivery model with a
wider assortment
than existing quick commerce companies which will be fed by Reliance’s own stores and the almost 20 lakh kiranas who source products from the company, said two executives aware of the plans. The kiranas are part of the JioMart Partner initiative whereby they source products from Reliance Retail’s wholesale arm and have their backend connected.
The company will be utilizing
tech platforms
such as
FYND
and
Locus
for the fulfilment process and optimise delivery routes to ensure orders reach within 30 minutes, considering Reliance is not setting up dark stores like other quick commerce operators who have such warehouses in each locality for under-ten-minute delivery, they said.
While Reliance Retail’s quick commerce venture will initially sell only
groceries
, it will start quick deliveries of apparel and electronics leveraging the entire 19,000-plus store network.
It has formed an inter-departmental team for its re-entry into quick commerce – Reliance Retail’s chief executive for grocery business Damodar Mall, JioMart chief executive
Sandeep Varaganti
and a senior team in corporate which will be further expanded as more categories get added.
Live Events
An email sent to Reliance Retail remained unanswered till Wednesday press time.
One of the executives said the company’s research shows consumers are willing to wait for most products instead of wanting them within 10 minutes. “The value for consumers in Reliance's quick commerce will be on the wider assortment and deals. Moreover, Reliance’s venture will be expanded
pan-India
and not just the top 8-10 cities which current quick commerce companies focus on,” he said.
Reliance's quick commerce venture will kick-off next month in eight cities such as Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Kolkata. The company has internally named the project as ‘JioMart Express’ which will be integrated in the existing JioMart app. Reliance had last year shelved its quick commerce pilot in Navi Mumbai when it was also called
JioMart Express
.
Reliance then did not find the foray profitable since unit cost of deliveries are higher than e-commerce with buying ticket sizes low. However, quick commerce has become the
fastest growing
channel for fast moving consumer goods companies in the last one-year accounting for up to 30% of their overall e-commerce revenue in 2023-24.
This shift in buying behavior prompted Reliance to re-enter this space. Industry executives have said quick commerce contributions for
FMCG
will go up further in the next couple of years.

At present, Blinkit holds the dominant position in the quick commerce
sector
, commanding approximately 40-45 per cent of the
market
share.
Reliance's decision coincides with
Walmart
's
Flipkart
also preparing to enter the quick commerce sector, a concept gaining popularity, especially among millennial and Gen Z households.
Unlike competitors, JioMart will utilize
Reliance Retail
's extensive network of stores and fulfillment centers instead of employing a dark store model for its quick commerce operations.
Currently, JioMart provides customers with the choice of scheduled delivery slots or next-day delivery options.
""Over time, JioMart will also deliver non-grocery items through quick commerce,"" sources said, adding that this is where it can effectively tap into
Reliance
Retail's over-18,000-stores across categories and formats. ""JioMart is focused on hyper local omni-channel presence and continues to serve its customers from thousands of stores located in proximity to consumers across the country,"" TOI reported citing a source.
Reliance's venture into quick commerce will heighten
competition
in the sector, with existing players facing the challenge of competing against the company's nationwide presence and substantial financial resources.
Goldman Sachs approximates the online grocery market's size by gross order value to be around $11 billion as of FY24. Among this, quick commerce already constitutes about half, or $5 billion in GOV. Analysts also suggest that immediate deliveries might be impacting the share of purchases from local kirana stores.

Apple not the only company to grapple with cash payments in India; cash also figures prominently in car sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/apple-not-the-only-company-to-grapple-with-cash-payments-in-india-cash-also-figures-prominently-in-car-sales/articleshow/110406938.cms,25-05-2024,"Apple
faced an unanticipated challenge soon after it opened two company-owned stores in
India
last April - many customers wanting to pay in cash - prompting the iPhone maker to install currency note counting machines in both the Mumbai and Delhi outlets.
With customers continuing to stream in with wads of notes to buy mobile phones or computers, payments for 7-9% of the American firm's
sales
in the two stores in India are made with cash, compared to less than 1% or even nil in its stores in the US or Europe, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Unsurprisingly then, social question-and-answer website
Quora
is full of queries from consumers on whether they can pay in cash at Apple stores in India, they said.
The proportion of consumers buying Apple products with cash is more in the Delhi store than in the Mumbai store, said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.
The two stores in India directly report to the Apple retail team in the US and not to the Apple India sales operations whereby their sales are also accounted for in the global books.
Live Events
ET's queries emailed to Apple did not elicit a response till press time.
But Apple is not alone in grappling with
cash payments
in India, even as the government has imposed a cash transaction limit of ₹2 lakh per person per transaction or per day or per event and occasion since 2017 to promote
digital payments
and restrain black money.
Cash in circulation in the country more than doubled to ₹35.15 lakh crore in March this year from ₹13.35 lakh crore in March 2017, indicating its importance as a means of transaction, ET reported last month.
This happened despite a surge in digital payments through
Unified Payments Interface
(UPI) to₹19.64 lakh crore at the end of April this year from₹2,425 crore in March 2017, as per the latest
National Payments Corporation of India
data.
The
Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations
(
FADA
) estimates that 15-20% of cars sold in India are self-funded. Even in the case of
luxury vehicles
, a fifth of sales happen through direct payment with buyers paying ₹2 lakh upfront in cash. Customers can pay the balance amount through an account payee cheque or bank draft or electronic clearing system through a bank account, net banking, debit cards or any other electronic means.
For German luxury carmaker
Mercedes-Benz India
, cash and
self-funded purchases
in Mumbai and Bengaluru have a higher share of 25% than 15% in the other markets in the country. ""Almost 20% of the customers opt for an all-cash purchase,"" said Santosh Iyer, managing director, Mercedes Benz India. A car dealer in Delhi said on condition of anonymity that he was at his wits' end when a buyer wanted to purchase a super luxury car with full cash.
Manish Raj Singhania, president at FADA, said there are many customers who do not want to avail financing options, do not want to pay interest and would rather pay through their savings at one go. ""There are others who do not have the necessary documents like income tax returns to avail of a bank loan or have not been deemed credit-worthy. And these buyers are there, not only in rural but also in urban markets. In all these cases, customers make payment with cash for up to ₹2 lakh (as per government regulations), cheques and RTGS (real-time gross settlement funds transfer between bank accounts),"" he said.

"Post-pandemic, Indians shopped...till they dropped (in FY24)",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/post-pandemic-indians-shopped-till-they-dropped-in-fy24/articleshow/110406971.cms,25-05-2024,"New Delhi|Mumbai: India's retail sales expansion is slowing down after a surge in spending across a gamut of segments - from clothes to cars - in the
post-pandemic
period, triggered by
revenge shopping
.
Zara
, the world's biggest clothing retailer, and
Starbucks
, the largest coffee retailer globally, saw their slowest ever sales growth in India during FY24, excluding the pandemic year.
Vedant Fashions
, which owns men's ethnicwear brand
Manyavar
, said this is the first time it has seen a weak wedding season for five quarters in a row, though a lower base will make for better sales numbers upon recovery.
Retail sales growth
rate fell year-on-year every month in the previous fiscal, reflecting weak
consumer sentiment
across segments such as apparel, footwear and quick service restaurants (QSR).
The previous fiscal's comparatively slower 4-7% growth rate sustained this year as well, with April seeing a 4% rise, the Retailers Association of India (RAI) said after a survey of top 100 retailers.
Live Events
""There is pressure across the board, but slightly higher in tier II cities, as shoppers are cautious with disposable income and not spending on
discretionary products
,"" said Devarajan Iyer, chief executive at Lifestyle International, India's largest departmental store chain. ""This slowdown is likely to continue for a longer period. We don't see any sign of recovery at least in the next three to four months.""
Revenge Shopping Petering Out
""This is something unique we have seen this time, and how we come out of this would (also) be something we see for the first time,"" said Vedant Modi, chief revenue officer at Vedant Fashions, at an analysts' call. ""The idea is that when we come out of five weak quarters, then typically, growth is better in the quarters after that.""
As Covid eased,
pent-up demand
led to booming sales across athleisure wear, apparel and lifestyle products. Consumers upgraded wardrobes after offices reopened, and eating out and socialising picked up. This led to 13-24% monthly growth throughout FY23.
However, that momentum is no longer sustaining.
""It is not really a slowdown because the growth post-pandemic was so high that it was never sustainable,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, chief executive of RAI. (Having said that,) ""we expected around 10% growth but saw just 5% on average.""
He said, ""Nearly 70% of the consumers, especially the middle class, bought a lot of
high-ticket items
- from electronics to cars - on EMI, compared to 40% a few years ago. This affected their wallet size and spending on other discretionary items such as clothing.""
Analysts and industry executives say they expect a recovery only after two to three quarters.
Many
direct-to-consumer brands
on
social commerce
are also chipping away
market share
from established bigger brands. ""The way fashion brands are doing is a matter of concern for us, but other categories such as electronics and beauty are growing by 18-20% and (have) helped us in achieving the target,"" said Dalip Sehgal, chief executive at Blackstone-backed Nexus Select, which runs 17 malls in the country. ""In the fashion segment also, some of the D2C brands are doing really well, so existing brands need to reinvent. I believe the second half of the year will be better.""
In its latest annual report, Tata Consumer, the Indian joint venture partner of
Starbucks
, highlighted demand softness in the entire QSR space in FY24, resulting in subdued same store sales growth.
Westlife Foodworld, the operator of McDonald's chain of restaurants in west and south India, saw same store sales growth fall 5% in the March quarter and 1.5% last fiscal.
""After several consecutive quarters of decline, out-of-home consumption trends in the fourth quarter remain relatively stable on a sequential basis,"" Saurabh Kalra, managing director at Westlife Foodworld, told investors. ""However, on a year-to-year basis, eating out frequency continues to be lower. Easing pressures on consumer wallets due to improving macros and moderating retail inflation will positively impact discretionary consumption, and we anticipate progressive improvement in coming quarters.""

"As mercury rises, so does the demand for home delivery",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/as-mercury-rises-so-does-the-demand-for-home-delivery/articleshow/110312261.cms,21-05-2024,"New Delhi:
Ecommerce
platforms are witnessing a surge in
demand
for essentials like
groceries
, as consumers opt for the convenience of shopping from home to avoid stepping out amid intense heatwave conditions. The spike in deliveries is also pushing up the demand for manpower at these companies.
In the last month, daily deliveries by ecommerce companies including quick-commerce platforms have crossed 2.0 million from 1.2-1.5 million a year earlier, said industry experts. According to
staffing
services provider
TeamLease Services
, the spike may generate demand for 10,000 additional operations personnel at the dark stores, or
distribution
centres, of the platforms and 30,000 more
bikers
to deliver the orders.
Quick-commerce orders had seen a sharp increase in the National Capital Region in the first couple of weeks in May, said Ujjwal Chaudhry, partner at consultancy firm
RedSeer
, adding: ""The Delhi-NCR has grown at almost 2X of overall growth from metro cities.""
This is largely attributable to the heat where people are unwilling to go outside for shopping, he said.
An increasing number of consumers are ordering ice-creams and beverages online apart from groceries, said executives at staffing and ecommerce firms.

""More than restaurant delivery, grocery delivery is seeing increased demand for bikers,"" said Kartik Narayan, chief executive, staffing at Teamlease Services. With demand for goods like
ice-cream
and cold drinks going up along with the temperatures, there is a big jump in the number of workers needed at the dark stores of the platforms as well for delivery of orders.
This
summer
,
Amazon
has seen a significant surge in demand for ice-cream and dairy products on
Amazon Fresh
, its grocery-delivery platform.
""We witnessed remarkable growth in both the ice-creams and dairy beverages categories, reflecting a 43% year-on-year increase in units sold for each. Moreover, our customer base expanded with a 20% rise in ice-cream shoppers and a 33% surge in those purchasing dairy and dairy alternative beverages,"" said Srikant Sree Ram, director, Amazon Fresh.
Jayen Mehta, managing director at the Amul dairy brand, said: ""We are seeing 55-60% higher sales on ecommerce and quick-commerce channels in April-May, compared to the same months last year."" Overall ice-cream sales across channels including grocery stores, modern trade, ecommerce, pushcarts and ice-cream parlours have increased 40% over last year, he said.
The surge is across summer-facing categories, executives said.
Manish Bandlish, managing director at
Mother Dairy
, said: ""With peak summers prevailing across most regions of the country, we are witnessing a significant surge in demand in portfolios like ice-creams, curd and beverages across key markets. Ice-creams alone have witnessed a rise of upwards of 20% compared to the same period last year.""
The demand for delivery and warehouse staff has gone up by 20% over the last summer. Companies have tweaked their incentive policies and improved the working conditions for the gig workers to encourage them to work in the hot summer. ""Due to the rise in
temperature
across all regions in India, buyers are reducing their time outside their homes for routine purchases,"" said Aditya Mishra, chief executive,

Retailers cut stocks of impacted spice brands like MDH and Everest,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-cut-stocks-of-impacted-spice-brands-like-mdh-and-everest/articleshow/110281323.cms,21-05-2024,"New Delhi: About a third (32%) of
retailers
are limiting stocks of
branded packaged spices
that are alleged to have
contaminants
, according to
grocery retail networking platform
Kirana Club, which has 1.8 million
kirana stores
on its network.
Hong Kong, Singapore and Nepal have put restrictions on the sale of some variants of spices from the
MDH
and
Everest
brands, alleging that these have more than the permissible level of
ethylene oxide
.
In terms of sales, though, the controversy has had limited impact on overall branded spices as a category, said Anshul Gupta, founder of Kirana Club.
“The issue hasn't reached widespread awareness yet. Those who are informed tend to associate the problem with two specific brands rather than the entire category,” Gupta said. He said a few retailers are keeping limited stocks of the two affected brands until the situation cools down.
Despite growing quick commerce, India’s estimated 12-million odd kirana, or neighbourhood, stores account for over three-fourths of annual sales of grocery, staples and daily essentials.

Following the controversy over contaminants in spices, the
All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation
, a body of FMCG distributors, issued an advisory to retailers to limit stocking of branded spices.
MDH and Everest did not respond to queries on retailers limiting stocks.
Early last month, Hong Kong banned a few variants of MDH and Everest spice powders, while Singapore also recalled variants of Everest spices alleging more than the permissible limits of ethylene oxide in samples, believed to cause cancer in the event of long exposure.
Both companies had denied the allegations on the presence of ethylene oxide in their products.
""We reassure our buyers and consumers that we do not use ethylene oxide at any stage of storing, processing or packing our spices,” MDH had said in a statement.
A spokesperson of Everest had said in a statement that its exports were cleared only after receiving necessary clearances and approval from the
Spice Board of India
and that its products “are safe and of high quality”.
The spokesperson had said that Everest’s products were not banned in either Hong Kong or Singapore. “Singapore's food safety authority referred to Hong Kong's recall alert and asked our Singapore importer to recall and temporarily hold the product for further inspection. This is a standard procedure and not a ban,” it said.
Meanwhile, the
national food safety regulator
is in the process of testing samples of all branded spices to detect the presence of ethylene oxide. In a related move, the Ministry of Commerce said the Spices Board has taken steps to ensure the safety and quality of Indian spice exports to Singapore and Hong Kong for ethylene oxide residue.

The standard prescribes specific responsibilities for review authors and administrators. It requires review authors to be identified, bars editing of reviews to alter messaging, and prohibits preventing or discouraging negative reviews.
The move comes after a voluntary push failed to effectively curb fake reviews. The department also saw a surge in e-commerce-related consumer complaints to 4,44,034 in 2023 from just 95,270 in 2018, making up 43 per cent of the total grievances registered.
A year earlier, the government issued quality norms for e-tailers, prohibiting them from publishing paid reviews and demanding disclosure of such promotional content. But the norms were voluntary in nature.
While welcoming the move, consumer activist Pushpa Girimji, who was present at the meeting, said ""enforceability"" of such standards will be key to checking the menace of fake reviews effectively.

56% of online shoppers found ratings on eComm sites to be positively biased: LocalCircles survey,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/56-of-online-shoppers-found-ratings-on-ecomm-sites-to-be-positively-biased-localcircles-survey/articleshow/110122891.cms,14-05-2024,"New Delhi: Nearly 56 per cent of

Despite the standards that prohibit deletion of negative ratings and reviews, the percentage of eCommerce users who found that their negative ratings and reviews were not always published has risen from 45 per cent to 52 per cent in the last 12 months, the survey revealed.
""Despite the controversy, 46 per cent of eCommerce users surveyed say they always referred to rating and reviews when buying while 44 per cent referred to them occasionally,"" it said.
Further, it said, only nine per cent of eCommerce users surveyed say that all eCommerce sites/ apps have enabled an interface so they can easily identify sponsored, incentivised or

Why touchy-feely consumerism is here to stay and also thrive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/why-touchy-feely-consumerism-is-here-to-stay-and-also-thrive/articleshow/110034179.cms,11-05-2024,"The sudden explosion of
e-commerce
in the past decade led to predictions of the death of
brick-and-mortar commerce
. But now even e-commerce is taking a U-turn to uninhibitedly embrace brick and mortar. As many D2C (direct-to-consumer) companies ramp up their
offline
presence in a bid to reach more customers, they are looking to hire talent to help drive their brick-and-mortar push,
ET
has reported.
D2C companies
were supposed to lead the push against brick and mortar, but many pure-play D2C businesses are seeing brick-and-mortar as a growth driver.
With this new trend, offline-versus-online binary seems to be imploding as both are seen complementing each other (big offline
FMCG
companies have been acquiring D2C brands as part of their omnichannel strategy).
The trend is not limited to D2C brands. In diverse sectors of India's economy, a thrust on brick and mortar is being seen as crucial for business growth.
Smartphones
go offline
Retail stores
are cementing their presence in the Indian smartphone market with sales in brick-and-mortar stores surging in the March quarter boosted by rising demand for
premium devices
. Share of
offline retail
in smartphone sales jumped to 61% in the three months ended March 31, from 56% in the December quarter, according to preliminary estimates from
Counterpoint Research

Rising offline sales come amid strong demand for premium handsets where the touch-and-feel experience is crucial for customers before purchasing, say experts. ET has reported that offline stores are also offering a bouquet of financing options such as no-cost monthly instalments, paper-based financing, and GST credit, along with some headroom for negotiation in the final price.
""Overall, over the last few quarters, offline has been the major channel for sales in the smartphone market. Online channels generally see a spike during the second half of the year, mainly during the festive period when they are able to pull back some share,"" Shilpi Jain, senior research analyst, Counterpoint Research, has said.
""Online exclusive brands have identified the growing trend of offline channels in India and are venturing into it gradually,"" Jain said.
Size and price matter
When it comes to buying big-ticket items like smartphones and televisions, consumers are moving back to brick-and-mortar stores from e-commerce while it's the opposite for daily necessities, according to companies and market researchers.
For ITC, the contribution of alternate channels has gone up to 25% of FMCG sales as compared to 17% in FY20, ET had reported in January. For Emami, the contribution of e-commerce has reached almost 13% of total sales, overtaking modern trade for the first time at 11%. For Dabur, e-commerce contribution is up from 7% to 10% in the last two years. The contribution of e-commerce to overall sales surged for staples to 9-10% in 2023 from 6% in 2021, according to a report by
Nuvama Institutional Equities
released in January.
However, after the pandemic a sharp uptick in e-commerce began ebbing which is more visible in expensive items and consumer durables. The share of e-commerce in total smartphone sales was 45% in 2023 compared with 48-49% in 2021 and 2022, according to Counterpoint Research data. For products such as televisions, the contribution has dropped to 29-30% from 34% last year, while for washing machines it's down to 18-19% from 21%, industry executives have told ET.
As per company executives, the rise of e-commerce in FMCG is due to convenience and the instant gratification provided by quick commerce platforms whereas the trend of premiumisation in apparel and electronics is bringing consumers back to stores.
Banks fall back on the tried and trusted
India's determined digital drive, which linked its villages to the internet at breakneck speed, also prompted what now seems to be rather premature obituaries of branch banking. More banks, contrary to expectations, are busy building brick-and-mortar presence across the country for access to something that has defined
banking
since it began: Deposits.
""Thanks to core banking, a lot of things can be done at the back end. But, at the same time, the proximity to customers is something which always works well in terms of enhancing trust and confidence of customers,"" Dinesh Khara, chairman of the
State Bank of India
, the country's biggest mass lender, had told ET in February.
Earlier banks had a captive depositor base in the absence of viable options, But now mutual funds, which have easier access due to the emergence of online brokers, are vying for deposits. To build a new customer base for deposits, banks must be visible in areas where they want to draw customers. That explains the addition of more than 3,500 branches in the past two years by just the top four private banks in the country.
While customers are content with doing transactions in the digital mode, a lot of complicated transactions such as investments, transfer of funds overseas and loans, still require visits to the branches. With cyber frauds on the rise and becoming more sophisticated and hard to detect, customers are likely to prefer bank branches for significant transactions.
Stores are getting bigger
Retailers across categories are opening bigger bricks-and-mortar stores along with expanding their existing stores as consumers are increasingly looking for a better experience in physical retail. According to data from real estate services firm
Anarock
, the share of stores smaller than 2,000 square feet declined to 52% in the first half of 2023-24, as against 61% a year ago. The share of stores sized 2,000-5,000 sq ft increased during this period, to 21% from 19%, as did that of those sized 5,000-10,000 sq ft (11% from 9%) and 10,000-15,000 sq ft (13% from 9%).
“Store is now more about experience than merchandising. Brands have realised that, and by expanding the store they are expanding the offering,” Pankaj Renjhen, COO and joint MD, Anarock Retail, had said.
“Today, shopping is more than just a mere transaction; consumers expect an overall pleasant buying experience. Ample in-store space allows for a wider selection of products and fosters an inviting atmosphere that elevates the shopping experience to newer heights,” Tushar Ved, President of Apparel Group India Pvt Ltd which sells brands such as Aldo, Canadian lingerie and sleepwear brand, la Vie en Rose, Charles & Keith and Bath & Body Works in India, had told ET last year.
While low-grade
shopping malls
are getting vacant, high-grade malls are witnessing a boom, ET reported a few days ago. The prevalence of e-commerce and the ease of buying online are not holding back people from visiting high-end shopping malls that offer a variety of experiences besides touch-and-feel shopping.
The wave of e-commerce triggered by India's new digital payment infrastructure and deeper penetration of the internet turned into a tsunami during the pandemic when people stayed locked in homes for long periods. It seems that trend has strengthened for low-priced items such as FMCG but weakened for expensive items such as consumer durables and experience-centric shopping such as expensive apparels.

, those with a vacancy rate of 40% or higher in 2023, are increasing. There has been a significant 59% year-on-year increase in ghost
shopping centres
across top 8 metros, with 13.3 million square feet of
retail space
remaining vacant, shows a
Knight Frank
report. This has resulted in a staggering loss of value amounting to $800 million in 2023.

Number of ghost malls rising in India, Delhi NCR tops the list
The National Capital Region (NCR) recorded the highest inventory of ghost shopping centres, with 5.3 million square feet, marking a 58% year-on-year increase. Mumbai and Bengaluru followed closely, with 2.1 million square feet (up 86% year-on-year) and 2 million square feet (an increase of 46% year-on-year), respectively. Hyderabad, on the other hand, witnessed a 19% decline in its ghost shopping centre inventory, reducing it to 0.9 million square feet in 2023. The report analyzed data from 340 shopping centres and 58 high streets across 29 Indian cities.
Are Indians deserting shopping malls?
The trend may suggest that people are deserting
shopping malls
, probably preferring to buy online rather than shop with their feet. But the Knight Frank report has another set of data that suggests people might be preferring online buying or storefronts to visiting lower-grade shopping malls but when it comes to
high-grade malls
they are not staying back.

Grade A mall stock, consisting of 82 assets with a gross leased area (GLA) of 58.2 million square feet, boasts enviable occupancy, strong tenant mix, good positioning, and active mall management, the report reveals. These Grade A shopping centres contribute 47% to the overall shopping centre space in the country. Grade B shopping centres, with decent occupancy and tenant mix, account for 31% of the total space, with 39.7 million square feet. Grade C stock, characterized by high vacancy rates, makes up the remaining portion.
Shishir Baijal, chairman & managing director of Knight Frank India, has highlighted the contrasting performance of different grades of malls. “Grade A malls have notably excelled, maintaining robust occupancy, foot traffic, and conversion rates, thereby delivering value to their customers. Conversely, Grade C assets and those classified as ghost shopping centres are lagging, prompting landlords to take action to rejuvenate or divest such properties,” he said.
What's behind the high-grade mall spree?
The reason why high-grade shopping malls are thriving could be the new retail trend of premiumisation also sweeping through the malls. Another related trend behind the decline of lower-grade malls and the rise of high-grade ones could be the emphasis on
consumer experience
.
Retailers across categories are opening bigger bricks-and-mortar stores along with expanding their existing stores as consumers are increasingly looking for a better experience in physical retail. According to data from real estate services firm
Anarock
, the share of stores smaller than 2,000 square feet declined to 52% in the first half of 2023-24, as against 61% a year ago. The share of stores sized 2,000-5,000 sq ft increased during this period, to 21% from 19%, as did that of those sized 5,000-10,000 sq ft (11% from 9%) and 10,000-15,000 sq ft (13% from 9%).
“Store is now more about experience than merchandising. Brands have realised that, and by expanding the store they are expanding the offering,” Pankaj Renjhen, COO and joint MD, Anarock Retail, had said.
Mall developers
are now focusing on building larger-sized malls to offer better shopping experience. The average size of mall developments that got completed in 2023 has increased by 41% from 276,800 sqft in 2022 to 389,900 sq ft., Rahul Arora, Head of Office Leasing Advisory and Retail Services, India,
JLL
, had told ET in February. Developers are coming up with bigger malls to offer elevated experience to the shoppers, be it entertainment, food & beverages (F&B), or fashion.
The new supply of retail space in shopping malls increased 72 percent last year to 59.48 lakh square feet across eight major cities to meet rising demand from retailers, according to Cushman & Wakefield. In 2023, as many as 11 shopping malls became operational, covering 59,48,395 square feet of space across the top eight cities. In the previous year, nine malls came into eight markets, totalling 34,49,222 square feet area. Hyderabad witnessed the completion of three shopping malls, while Pune and Chennai had two each. One shopping mall each came up in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Ahmedabad. No fresh supply was seen in Kolkata.
Malls are expected to attract investment of more than Rs 20,000 crore over the next 3-4 years as the country's biggest mall developers,
DLF
, Prestige and Phoenix, have entered the next phase of expansion as almost all top retailers are expanding their store count, industry executives have told ET.
Realty major DLF has started construction of its new 26-27 lakh square feet shopping mall in Gurugram at a cost of around Rs 2,200 crore as part of its expansion plan, PTI reported last month. It is constructing a premium mall also in Goa measuring around 6 lakh square feet.
A new mall phenomenon
A new type of mall is set to witness a surge in India. At least half a dozen
factory outlet malls
are being planned in India, like in the US and UK, as developers of retail facilities attempt to fight ecommerce rivals in a market increasingly driven by deep discounting, ET had reported last year. While such retail spaces, where brands are offered on discount round the year, are popular globally, the segment is unorganised in India.
""Retail will not be limited to malls and high streets, but move to highways with more infrastructure being built. On highways, factory outlets mall along with F&B and recreational makes sense. In coming years, this is going to be a popular concept,"" Susil S. Dungarwal, founder of Beyond Squarefeet, a shopping mall specialist company, had told ET.

A big consumer tide is coming to India. Who all will rise?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/a-big-consumer-tide-is-coming-to-india-who-all-will-rise/articleshow/109921787.cms,07-05-2024,"India's biggest conglomerate is betting higher on its
consumer
business.
Reliance Industries Ltd
(RIL) is entering the consumer electronics and home appliances
market
with a new made-in-
India
brand Wyzr. RIL's retail unit,
Reliance Retail
, has just launched Wyzr air coolers and plans to extend the range to categories such as televisions, washing machines, refrigerators, air conditioners, small appliances and LED bulbs.
Reliance Consumer Products
(RCPL) has already been growing rapidly.
The
FMCG
company clocked Rs 3,000 crore sales in FY24, its first full year of operations, ET has reported.. To put in perspective RCPL's performance, Emami with five decades of operations reported Rs 3,400 crore sales in FY23, while oral care market leader
Colgate-Palmolive
(India) posted revenue of Rs 5,226 crore the same year which marked its eighth decade of operations.
India's another big conglomerate, the
Tata Group
, too is tapping the consumer business opportunity with a host of brands as well as a super app Tata Neu. These big industrial groups have an eye on the immense
growth
potential of India's
consumer market
which is growing rapidly.
The third largest consumer market
India is on track to become the third largest consumer market in 2026, overtaking Germany and Japan, and behind the US and China, as people in the affluent category increase, investment bank UBS said in its latest report released Monday. “As of 2023, there were an estimated 40 million people in India (4% share in the population of 15 years and above) in the affluent category (annual income above $10,000), and these will likely more than double in the next 5 years,” UBS said, highlighting 88 million people with over $10,000 annual income by 2028.
Last year, a report by BMI, a Fitch Solution company, made the same prediction. It said India’s
household spending
per capita would outpace that of other developing Asian economies like Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand at 7.8% year-on-year. The gap between total household spending across ASEAN and India will also almost triple, it said.
Live Events
Household consumption has doubled over the past decade. In rural areas, the average Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) was Rs 1,430 in 2011-12 which rose to Rs 3,773 in 2022-23, while in urban areas, the average MPCE rose from Rs 2,630 in 2011-12 to Rs 6,459 per household, as per the recently released Household Consumption Expenditure Survey data.
The share of expenditure on food has declined, while the share of expenditure on non-food items has increased. This indicates that Indian households have more disposable income and are spending more on discretionary items, such as clothing, footwear, transport, education, health, and entertainment. The share of expenditure on food in rural India has fallen from 52.9% in 2011-12 to 46.38% in 2022-23, while the share of expenditure on food in urban India has fallen from 42.62% in 2011-12 to 39.17% in 2022-23.
All this means that consumption in India is not only rising but also maturing, from food to non-food items.
The high tide
The expansion in India's consumer market will be a multi-faceted phenomenon. Besides attracting more global brands and investment, the tide will not only buoy the biggies such as Reliance, Tata and
Hindustan Unilever
, but also the newbies such as
Honasa Consumer
that sell directly to consumers.
India's consumer market is being shaped by the
digital economy
as internet penetration deepens and digital payments catch on with more people. The trajectory of consumer market growth will be different from the past with India now having more young consumers. While the big firms will have to find ways to become nimble to exploit this growth opportunity, for small ones it will become easier to grow. The new consumer will be more choosy and open to experiment.
Already, India’s elite classes are becoming pickier consumers, fueling the success of organic personal-care brands backed by slick social media marketing campaigns, Bloomberg reported last month. The rise of companies like local upstart Honasa Consumer Ltd, and the inroads made by global names including Estee Lauder Companies Inc. and Clinique Laboratories LLC, is forcing Hindustan Unilever to spend more on product development and advertising. The company’s challenges mirror those of other consumer-goods giants, such as Procter & Gamble Co., L’Oreal SA and its London-based parent, which in recent years have had to acquire the niche brands taking market share from their in-house businesses.
While consumer preferences are expected to pan out differently from the past, the geography too can become a challenge for big brands which focus on big cities but a rich class is coming up in small towns too. Consumer behaviour expert Rama Bijapurkar has argued in her recent book ‘Lilliput Land’ how India’s many consumers are not just misunderstood but are also underserved by firms that stick to principles that may be applicable to other economies. ""The point I make in my book also is that the rich are everywhere, in every little pocket,"" she said in an interview to TOI. ""Now, with better connectivity, we actually will find that people are opting to stay in smaller towns for a better quality of life. So, companies should look at all of India as their oyster, instead of having some caste system of where they will go.""
India's as the the third-largest consumer market will be a multifaceted phenomenon which will offer scope and opportunities for new, smaller brands while requiring the big players to become more nimble and design their strategies as per the newly emerging demographics and consumer behaviour.

A guide on spotting fake reviews and being a savvy online consumer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/a-guide-on-spotting-fake-reviews-and-being-a-savvy-online-consumer/articleshow/109905271.cms,07-05-2024,"Like us, have you also been scrambling to grab all the best deals on
Amazon
before it's
Great Summer Sale
2024 ends today? Like us, are you also struggling to make sense of what’s worth your moolah and what isn’t amid the veritable ocean of
product reviews
? Then this article might be for you.
‘Tis the
digital age
, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a television you’re looking to buy or a tiny vegetable chopper, product reviews are holy. And these reviews apply to other services too — like booking hotels or trying new restaurants. But there’s always a catch, and lurking beneath the surface of seemingly helpful feedback can often be a sinister underbelly of
fake reviews
.
Deceptive endorsements, crafted to manipulate and mislead, can wreak havoc on a business's reputation or send you down a path of buyer's remorse. In 2023 alone,
Tripadvisor
removed a staggering 1.3 million fraudulent reviews! Another research conducted by the UK government found that 11-15% of reviews in specific product categories were thought to be fraudulent.
So, how can you, the savvy
online consumer
, navigate this minefield of opinions? Here's a survival guide:
Trust your spidey sense:
Genuine reviews feel real. They offer a balanced perspective, highlighting both the good and the bad. If a review gushes with unbridled praise or spews negativity without explanation, approach with caution.

Read between the lines:
Authentic feedback has a personal touch. It reflects the reviewer's unique experience. Beware of generic, repetitive reviews that sound like marketing copy – they might just be cleverly disguised ads.
Digging deeper:
Look for details! Genuine reviewers often provide specifics about what they encountered. Did the product have a faulty feature? Was the delivery delayed? Reviews lacking concrete details raise red flags.
Spot the anomalies:
Be wary of sudden bursts of overwhelmingly positive or negative reviews. These could be orchestrated attempts to manipulate ratings, not genuine consumer voices.
Review the reviewer:
Just like you wouldn't trust a stranger's advice on the street, don't blindly accept every online review. Look for reviewers who establish credibility through details about their experience.
Fight the good fight:
We all have a role to play in combating fake reviews. Platforms like Amazon offer guidelines for spotting deception, and consumer groups can provide valuable insights.
The tech takeover:
The good news? Technology is on our side. Advancements in AI are creating tools to identify suspicious patterns and flag potential fake reviews. By analysing social media interactions and spotting suspicious language, AI helps maintain the integrity of online review systems.
So next time you shop online, keep an eye out for fake reviews and don’t hesitate to flag them. Remember, by working together, we can keep online reviews a valuable resource for everyone. Happy shopping!

How quick commerce is rewriting the rules of retail in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/how-quick-commerce-is-rewriting-the-rules-of-retail-in-india/articleshow/109887919.cms,06-05-2024,"""Is instant delivery even a thing?"" Just two years back, this question was relevant. Many people didn't take
quick commerce
, or super-fast deliveries, seriously. Some even said that customers don't really need stuff delivered in 10-15 minutes.
Now, quick commerce is becoming super popular, especially among millennials and
Gen Z
. Companies are not just delivering
groceries
anymore. They're bringing everything from fans and T-shirts to jewelry and iPhones right to your doorstep in no time.
Interestingly, quick commerce probably makes up about 5-6 per cent of what a household spends on groceries, TOI has reported.
According to Goldman Sachs, Blinkit, a big player in quick commerce, is now valued at around $13 billion.
That's even higher than Zomato's main food delivery business. This shows how quickly this type of delivery is growing. It's mostly popular in big cities, but it's catching on in places like Vizag, Nagpur, Kochi, Jaipur, and Lucknow too, executives from Swiggy and Big Basket told TOI.
Seshu Kumar Tirumala, chief buying and merchandising officer at
BigBasket
said, ""In the past one year, half the new customers that we have added are all pure play quick commerce customers, who often do not make planned purchases and end up buying 4-15 times a month from our platform.”

Swiggy's Instamart, has seen quick commerce grow a lot in places like Jaipur and Kochi over the past year. “Given the wide array of products, we are seeing good traction in both metros and non-metros,” TOI quoted Phani Kishan, CEO,
Swiggy Instamart
as saying.
Experts say that people are starting to shift some of their grocery shopping from local stores to quick commerce.
Source: TOI
“Incremental purchases solely cannot justify the growth of quick commerce. Some parts of offline purchases and scheduled online deliveries have moved to the segment. The platforms are also getting sales from impulse purchases which will not go to kirana stores,” said Satish Meena, advisor at market research firm Datum Intelligence.
Platforms like
Zepto
, Swiggy Instamart, and
Blinkit
are expanding into other categories like beauty products, toys, and electronics. Right now, non-grocery items make up about 15-20 per cent of quick commerce sales.
Kishan said: “If consumers can get a toy or a BPC item on a quick commerce platform instantly, they won’t wait for Amazon and Flipkart to deliver it to them. That is why players like Flipkart have started working on the quick commerce model,” Meena said. “Consumers have been ordering everything, from gold coins during the festive season to air purifiers, FASTags, headphones, toys and more.”
Goldman Sachs
says the online grocery market is worth about $11 billion, and half of that is quick commerce. Quick commerce platforms are often able to offer products 10%-15% cheaper than local stores.“Given the scale of platforms such as Blinkit, they are able to get pricing/sourcing advantage from manufacturers,” said analysts at the firm.
“We want to become an attractive option even when compared to the best discount grocers in the offline space. If we can give consumers access to better prices and 10-minute deliveries, why won’t they buy from Zepto?” co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha had told TOI earlier.

Government push to help ONDC get shopfront on ecommerce sites,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/govt-push-to-help-ondc-get-shopfront-on-ecomm-sites/articleshow/109671671.cms,29-04-2024,"The Centre has asked
Amazon
and
Flipkart
to set up Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) storefronts on their home pages to help the
government-backed network
scale up operations and assist with deliveries, said executives aware of the development. The aim is to boost operations and order efficiencies as well as iron out glitches and delays on
ONDC
, they said.
ONDC managing director T Koshy told ET that the network is ""in active discussion with Amazon and Flipkart for a phased participation and that results could be expected soon.""
Amazon and Flipkart didn't respond to queries.
The development is significant as ONDC, which started operations in January last year, was pitched as an effort to counter the dominance of Amazon and Flipkart.

Amazon has over 1.1 million sellers in India with more than 50% in tier 2 towns and cities.
In February last year, Amazon had announced plans to integrate its
logistics
network - from pickup to
delivery
- and SmartCommerce services with ONDC. SmartCommerce is Amazon's software offering that enables small and medium-sized businesses in India to build and scale their operations across digital platforms. These
small businesses
will now be able to use it to join the ONDC network, Amazon had said.
This was when Flipkart's logistics subsidiary Ekart was in advanced stages of
integration
with ONDC. The logistics arm of Flipkart had already joined the network.
Marketplace integration plans
Sources had said at the time that Amazon won't integrate Amazon Transport Services entirely and that only the last mile will be joined with ONDC. There were no immediate plans to integrate Amazon India's core marketplace with ONDC, they had said.
If Amazon's core marketplace is integrated with ONDC, the US ecommerce giant's users will be able to see product catalogues of more than 105,000 non-mobility sellers currently live on the government-backed network. The network makes it easier for smaller players to get onboard without paying a hefty commission and not having to individually onboard Amazon.
ONDC is live in sectors such as grocery and fast-moving consumer goods, food and beverage, ride-hailing, agriculture products, fashion and apparel, health and wellness, beauty and personal care, electronics and appliances, home and kitchen, business-to-business transactions, exports, metro ticketing and financial products. The cities or districts from which more than 100 orders per month emanate, labelled 'countable cities' by the network, rose to 622 in the January-March period.
In discussions with NRAI
ONDC is also in discussions with the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI), which represents over 500,000 restaurants, for seamless last-mile connectivity for food delivery, order tracking and discoverability, food services executives said.
The ONDC, along with NRAI, has set up a Champion Council comprising prominent representatives from among casual and fine-dine chains, quick-service restaurants, cloud kitchens, cafes and regional players, said an executive directly involved with the body. The aim is to ensure growth and smoother and wider participation from the sector.
The government-backed network, which competes directly with independent food delivery aggregators Swiggy and Zomato, has integrated end-to-end services for first-mover buyer and seller platforms such as Magicpin and Paytm.
Active in 13 segments
Network participants have risen to 81 from 24 in the last 14 months. The network is active in 13 domain categories, having started with three. Buyer apps accounting for meaningful order volumes include Paytm, Snapdeal, Magicpin, Pincode, Mystore, Rapidor, NoBrokerHood, Ola and nStore.
""Unlike the dedicated food delivery apps, ONDC has multiple options, so a concern is who drives traffic and stickiness towards restaurants,"" said a food services sector executive. ""The larger scale has not yet been reached and will happen over time.""
Since its formal launch in January last year, ONDC has facilitated more than 49.79 million transactions. Mobility led by ride-hailing apps such as Namma Yatri continues to dominate with more than 50% of total monthly orders. From February last year to March this year, mobility accounted for more than 32.2 million orders while non-mobility accounted for more than 17.5 million orders.
During the same period, food and beverages accounted for more than 5.78 million orders while grocery accounted for more than 1.74 million orders, fashion accounted for more than 2.64 million orders, and home and kitchen accounted for more than 1.35 million orders.
Companies and platforms that have been onboarded include Wow Momo, McDonald’s and Domino's Pizza in food and beverage; Marico, P&G and Hindustan Unilever in FMCG; and Namma Yatri, Kochi Open Mobility Network and Ola in mobility.
Barbeque Nation and cloud kitchen aggregator Rebel Foods, which operates Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story Pizza and Faasos, are among the large chains that have onboarded ONDC in recent months.
ONDC had its alpha rollout in April 2022 in five cities to test live transactions with a closed group of sellers and buyers.

Retailers body to seek govt intervention on POCO's business practices,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-body-to-seek-govt-intervention-on-pocos-business-practices/articleshow/109471333.cms,21-04-2024,"The South Indian Organised Retailers Association is planning to seek the central government's intervention with regard to the business practices of POCO, a sub-brand of
Xiaomi
, alleging that the cell phone manufacturer is avoiding the supply of phones to mainline channels.
In a statement, the ORA claimed that the business methods of the firm are a clear indication of POCO's attitude to minimise spending by reaching the product through online and ""illegitimate"" channels without providing consumer experience.
The
retailers body
also said that POCO is not contributing to employment generation in India, as the brand operates with just three distributors and ""no sales promoters"" in stark contrast to other major smartphone brands like Samsung, VIVO, and OPPO.
These actions by POCO not only harm the legitimate sales channels but also result in financial losses to the government exchequer, ORA charged. ""POCO's unfair and unethical business practices have serious implications for the industry and economy as a whole.
We cannot allow a brand to operate in India at the expense of legitimate businesses and government revenue. ORA will urge the competent authorities to take swift action against POCO and set a precedent for ethical business conduct in the country,"" the statement said. POCO officials could not be reached for comment.

In addition, ORA is prepared to file a case with the
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) to ensure accountability and transparency in the smartphone market, it added.

Retailers report 8% growth in March 2024,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-report-8-growth-in-march-2024/articleshow/109440064.cms,19-04-2024,"Retail sales
in
March 2024
showed a
growth
of 8% as compared to the sales levels in March 2023, according to the survey by
Retailers Association of India
(RAI).
Retail businesses across regions have indicated growth in sales as compared to March 2023 sales level with the highest in
South India
signaling a growth of 9%, while
West India
indicated a growth of 8% followed by North and
East India
signalling a growth of 7% and 6% respectively.
"" In March 2024, our review of the retail sector revealed signs of a recovery in growth. The consumption landscape appears robust, driven by increased discretionary spending on apparels and sporting goods. However, the jewellery sector, despite its significant growth since last Diwali, has experienced a slight slowdown this past month, likely due to the recent surge in gold prices. CDIT (consumer durables and IT) segment is still yet to recover,” said
Kumar Rajagopalan
, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI).
“In the lead-up to the 2024 General Elections, we are optimistic about the retail sector's growth prospects. Historically, election years catalyse economic activities, enhancing consumer spending across regions and categories. This year, we anticipate a similar trend, with substantial increases in discretionary spending, particularly in sectors such as FMCG and consumer durables,” Rajagopalan said.
In categories, sports goods reported a growth of 11% followed by apparel and beauty showing a growth of 10% each as compared to sales levels in March 2023.

"Complaint filed against Flipkart, BigBasket for allegedly making employees work on election day",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/complaint-filed-against-flipkart-bigbasket-for-allegedly-making-employees-work-on-election-day/articleshow/109379988.cms,17-04-2024,"NEW DELHI: A
complaint
has been filed against e-commerce major
Flipkart
and Tata Group firm
BigBasket
for allegedly making
delivery boys
work on the day of voting on April 19 in the state. In the complaint filed before
Tamil Nadu
state election commissioner B Kothi Nirmalasamy on Wednesday, Chennai High Court lawyer K Narasimhan has stated that despite the state government declaring leave of April 19 for the
election day
, Flipkart and BigBasket are promising guaranteed delivery of orders even on the day of voting.
Narasimhan said that as per government order April 19 has been officially declared a
public holiday
under section 25 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 to facilitate the electoral process.
He said that the Labour Welfare and Skill Development Department of Tamil Nadu has mandated a paid holiday for all employees working in shops, commercial establishments, industrial establishments and IT companies on April 19 to ensure their participation in the democratic process.
""Despite the directive, it has come to our notice that online delivery platforms such as Flipkart and Big Basket are continuing to guarantee delivery services on April 19. This raises serious concerns regarding the infringement of delivery personnel's rights, particularly those who are integral to the operations of these platforms,' the complaint said.
The complainant has demanded an investigation into the claims of e-commerce of guaranteed delivery on voting day and to take appropriate measures to uphold the democratic rights of all workers irrespective of their state of origin.
Live Events
When contacted, Flipkart said it is giving paid holidays to only eligible employees.
""At the Flipkart group, we're following all the directives and guidelines provided by the authorities with regard to polling day, and are giving all eligible employees a paid holiday to exercise their franchise. In addition, we have taken steps to drive awareness and encourage employees to vote,"" the Flipkart spokesperson said.

24Seven operates about 145 stores in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), Punjab and Hyderabad.
Launched in 2005, the chain offers grocery, staples, snacks, beverages, personal care products, the Modi group's own beauty brand Colorbar, as well as ready-to-eat food counters at some of the larger format stores. ""Grocery retail has significant upside, and the 24Seven format is scalable as a blend of hyper-convenience grocery, staples, general merchandise, and even small in-store cafes, despite current accumulated losses,"" said the executive cited above.
Trent Ltd
, the retail arm of the
Tata Group
, operates grocery chain Star Bazaar. But grocery remains a small part of the diversified group's overall retail business and 24Seven may only add incremental value, another executive said. Trent's other retail chains - Westside and Zudio - have grown and expanded faster than Star Bazaar.
Reliance Retail Ventures operates close to 50 stores under the 7-Eleven brand as master
franchise
partner of the Texas-based chain, having started in 2021.
""A potential
acquisition
could lead to Reliance merging its own convenience store chain with 24Seven - both formats are similar,"" another executive said.
Avenue Supermarts, operator of DMart stores, sells general merchandise and apparel, but its business is largely grocery-focused, and it's looking to expand this segment aggressively. The chain reported 7% growth in
revenue
per store and 13% year-on-year increase in store additions for the quarter ended March, up 20% over the corresponding year-ago quarter.
Modi Enterprises
managing director Samir Modi didn't respond to queries. Spokespersons of Tata Trent and Avenue Supermarts declined to comment.
A Reliance Retail spokesperson said in an email: ""As a policy, we do not comment on media
speculation
and rumours.""
FY23 Revenue
Godfrey Phillips' retail business division reported revenue from operations at ₹396 crore in FY23, or 9.3% of tobacco maker's total. However, its retail business division declared a negative net worth on account of accumulated losses as of March 31, 2023.
""After due consideration of the stakeholders' feedback, long-term performance of the division since inception, prevailing market conditions of the retail sector and long-term business strategy of the company, the board... has decided to exit... its retail business division,"" Godfrey Philips had said last week, while announcing the move.

Deal activity on the rise in consumer & retail sector,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/deal-activity-on-the-rise-in-consumer-retail-sector/articleshow/109355054.cms,17-04-2024,"India’s consumer and retail sector saw a surge in M&A and private equity deal activity in the March quarter with deal value growing by nearly a third and volume by a fifth from a year earlier.
The segment recorded 102 deals valued at $1.74 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up from 85 deals totalling $1.28 billion a year ago, Grant Thornton Bharat said in a report shared exclusively with ET.
The consumer space also saw 88 PE deals, highest in five quarters by volume. However, the consumer industry reported a decline in M&A activity with volumes declining to 14 deals from 17 a year ago although the value surged to $925 million from $79 million in 2023.
""This is potentially an outcome of the impending elections leading the businesses to adopt a cautious approach, coupled with sluggishness in consumer spending, leading to slow revenue growth. However, it evidenced substantial increase in terms of deal value, primarily driven by
Tata Consumer Goods
’ acquisition of
Capital Foods
valued at $615 million and
Organic India
valued at $229 million. Together these two deals contributed to a 91% share in M&A values, at $843 million,"" said Naveen
Malpani
, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat.
PE activity recorded the highest quarterly volume since Q3 2022 with 88 deals valued at $823 million, indicating a volume increase by 30% though deal value fell 32%. This was due to more small ticket transactions in the quarter.

In fact, small value deals at less than 7 million contributed to about half of PE deal volume. Also, late-stage companies raising Series B rounds or above contributed significantly to deal activity.
Top five deals in the sector accounted for 59% of value at $1.03 billion but only 5% of volume. Among these, four deals belonged to the food processing segment.
""Fuelled by a growing healthy food market in India expected to reach $30 billion by 2026, established players actively seek acquisitions of niche brands catering to specific dietary needs or premiumization trends,"" added Malpani.
Within e-commerce, the largest deal was led by a consortium of investors including
Jungle Ventures
, SIDBI Ventures, Anicut Capital,
Sharrp Ventures
and angel investors in The Ayurveda Experience for $27 million in a late-stage Series C round. Textiles, apparels and accessories and consumer services segment marked the second-highest deal volume with a 34% share at $192 million. PE deal activity in the quarter was led by Samara Capital and Convergent Finance in AgroTech Foods acquiring a 52% stake for $78 million.
""There is confidence established in eCommerce by a superior stint of all the brands that have created a mark for themselves. The increase in demand for value-added products further cements the fact that real Bharat is shopping online and seeks affordability, accessibility and seamless experience. By strengthening logistics, ops and evolving tech innovation across digital commerce, untapped potential that lies in tier 2 tier 3 cities is being tapped and is ready to scale further.,” said Chirag Taneja, Cofounder, Gokwik.

Retail buying in Asia including India fuels gold price momentum: Goldman Sachs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-buying-in-asia-including-india-fuels-gold-price-momentum-goldman-sachs/articleshow/109290539.cms,14-04-2024,"Gold prices have experienced a notable surge in recent weeks, with the yellow metal witnessing an increase of over 11% in
India
alone.
A recent report from
Goldman Sachs
highlights that this surge is not solely driven by traditional factors, indicating a shift in the dynamics of the gold market.
The report underscores the significant role played by new incremental factors, particularly the surge in accumulation by
Central Banks
in emerging markets (EM) and increased retail buying in Asian markets including India have led to an increase in gold prices worldwide.
Despite expectations of fewer
Federal Reserve
rate cuts, strong growth trends, and record-breaking
equity
markets, gold has rallied by 17 percent over the past two months.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs note that the traditional fair value of gold, which typically correlates with real rates, growth expectations, and currency strength, does not fully explain the recent price movement. Instead, unconventional factors, supported by current macroeconomic policies and geopolitical tensions, have been pivotal in driving gold's bullish momentum.

Moreover, the anticipation of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in the year, coupled with right-tail risks from the US election cycle and fiscal policies, further reinforces the positive trajectory of gold prices.
While the report outlines key measures that could potentially control gold's bullish momentum, such as a peaceful resolution to geopolitical tensions, major emerging markets Central Banks' gold buying programs, and stabilization in
China
's growth concerns, the likelihood of significant impact in the near term remains low.
Overall, the report underscores the expectation for continued bullish momentum in gold prices, emphasizing the evolving dynamics and the influence of unconventional factors in driving the precious metal's value.
While the increase in gold prices is advantageous for gold owners, higher prices pose challenges for consumers, particularly in countries like India where gold holds cultural significance. The impact extends to the economy, affecting India's
current account
deficit and trade balance.
Interestingly, both gold and
stocks
are currently reaching record highs. In India, both gold and
Sensex
has surpassed the magical 75,000 figure.

"Tata Digital CEO steps up focus on costs, business cohesion",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tata-digital-ceo-steps-up-focus-on-costs-business-cohesion/articleshow/109143286.cms,09-04-2024,"Mumbai |Bengaluru:
Naveen Tahilyani
, who took charge in February as
Tata Digital
's new CEO, is believed to have put a tight control on spends in the
ecommerce
business and has introduced greater accountability and sharper data-focused approach to operations, according to Tata group officials. Mandated to give momentum and executional heft to the digital ecommerce entity, Tahilyani is taking on a more hands-on approach, the officials said.
Tahilyani, handpicked by Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran from the group's
insurance
business
Tata AIA Life Insurance
, is also bringing in a collaborative mindset to smoothen operational glitches and boost participation from group companies, company sources said.
Since taking up the new role in February, Tahilyani is being guided closely by Chandrasekaran, who is keen to see the consumer app gain a stronger foothold before seeking any external investor interest.
Simultaneously, Tata Digital's online pharmacy 1mg is expected to embark on a major offline expansion by opening retail stores where it will sell medicines and offer medical lab testing facilities, people aware of the matter said. The company has approved the plan in a recent board meeting.
""The plan is in place and Naveen has interacted with both 1mg and BigBasket leadership on the way forward. There is work being done on
Tata Neu
's loyalty pass-NeuPass-,"" said one of the persons cited above. The budget allocation for 1mg for offline expansion will be finalised later this month, another person said.

""The consumer industry acumen is really coming through in our interactions so far and plans are quite sharp. In general, the mandate has been to grow sustainably-whether for private investments or individual IPO plans of digital assets like BigBasket,"" said a third person aware of the matter.
Tata Digital did not comment on ET's queries.
Earlier, there was angst within Tata Digital that separate businesses were not allowed to take independent operational decisions, which led to friction and operational delays, Tata group officials said. ""Tahilyani is focusing on organisational cohesion and a more collaborative approach of offering Tata Neu as a digital platform on which businesses can take informed decisions on what works best for their individual businesses,"" said an official close to the matter.
""The earlier CEO-Pratik Pal- has been credited for laying the foundation of the businesses and getting it off the ground. The next phase now needed good execution to bring in consumers through effective execution for which Tahilyani has been brought in,"" the official said.
Top officials close to the development said all strategies are being implemented backed by information and analytics. This includes deferring a plan to integrate operational structures of key group assets such as BigBasket, 1mg, and Tata Cliq to enhance consumer responsiveness to Tata Neu superapp.
""The view taken is that until the Tata Neu app becomes efficient and a consumer's first choice in ease of usage, the other separate apps cannot be killed,"" said people familiar with the matter.
""There have been meetings across team and Cliq CEO Gopal Asthana with the
commerce
team of Neu as fashion has to be scaled. Earlier, integrating Croma took much longer to get them on Neu. These are being changed now,"" one of the persons cited above said.
The flagship digital asset, BigBasket, is also looking to raise up to $100 million in funding from parent Tata Sons. BigBasket is continuing to burn cash in its quick commerce
business
BB Now, while the core grocery business has stabilised in terms of cash spends to grow.

fiscal
. “As of March 28, the procurement has crossed Rs 4 lakh crore. It is historic,” said
GeM
CEO
P K Singh
.
GeM was launched in, 2016 for
online purchases
of goods and services by all government agencies.
Singh said that
defence sector
buyers are buying several goods and services from the platform. “Assembly of
BrahMos missile
is being done through GeM as a service contract. In defence, right from supplying eggs up to the missile parts is being done through the portal,” he said. In 2021-22 the procurement value was Rs 1.06 lakh crore and crossed Rs 2 lakh crore last financial year.
Singh said that procurement of services from the portal has jumped to Rs 2.05 lakh crore so far this fiscal from Rs 66,000 crore in 2022-23. Similarly, goods worth Rs 1.95 lakh crore have been bought from the platform till March 28 this fiscal. On being asked about the possibility of opening up the GeM portal for consumer at large, he said: “Yes we will be mulling over, we are preparing for that, we should be prepared for that if the government so desires. If feasible, if practical, we will do a small pilot in this area as well in the coming years, if the approvals are in place”. Certain countries from Africa and South East Asia are showing keen interest in GeM and India can provide consultancy services and also set up similar platform for them.
“We have queries from several quarters. They have seen and studied our systems,” Singh said, adding that the plan is to develop GeM as a unified procurement portal of the country. Currently, only goods and services are allowed on the platform and “we want to include works contract also and if it will come, it will be a big hit” he said. Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Odisha, Bihar, Assam, and Uttarakhand have placed significant procurement orders in the current fiscal.

Kiko hits 99% fulfillment rates and doubles Kirana orders,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/kiko-hits-99-fulfillment-rates-and-doubles-kirana-orders/articleshow/108868756.cms,29-03-2024,"Kiko Live
said it has over 99% fill and
fulfillment rates
and processed 1.3 lakh
kirana orders
for
retailers
over the
ONDC network
. The company is working with ONDC to improve processes further and now seeks to improve
business metrics
further.
""ONDC is constantly working with us to improve processes further and keep improving this metric, and also bring multiple
hyperlocal logistics partners
on the platform to bring delivery speeds on par with Quick Commerce. We are working to fulfill every retailer's dream of a successful digital footprint,” Alok Chawla, Co-Founder of Kiko Live, said.
Fill rate means if a customer orders five items and receives only three products, then the fill rate is 60%. Fulfilment rate means the total received orders which are delivered. Then company also presented their business case on Shark Tank recently where
Zomato
founder Deepinder Goyal said digital sales by retail stores cannot succeed due to low fulfillment rates of 70%, relating to the Blinkit experience of fulfilling orders from stores before it moved to the dark store lead business.
The SaaS solution for neighbourhood stores said it has processed over one lakh total orders on the ONDC network. Since its onboarding on the open network in December last year, sellers on Kiko have witnessed significant business growth with nearly 2500 orders per day. The company works directly with kirana stores to digitize their business.
""Our sales team invests time and effort with each retailer signing up with us and helps him start getting at least 10-15 new orders a day before moving on to onboarding and setting up the next retailer. Let alone 5%; some of our retailers have seen their business more than double after working with us,” Chawla added.

About 13 million kirana stores in India generate over $800 billion in annual business, yet most of them do not have a digital footprint. These sellers continue to depend on orders received over call and Whatsapp for their home delivery business which constitutes over 10% of their business — that's an $80 billion plus kirana led home delivery business that already exists today, in spite of availability of quick commerce.
Quick commerce at under $4 billion is a small fraction of the kirana home delivery business even today. Kiko Live helps sellers build their digital storefront on ONDC Network and helps them give their store customers an online experience.

Retail brands flocking to religious cities with rise in spiritual tourism,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-brands-flocking-to-religious-cities-with-rise-in-spiritual-tourism/articleshow/108845608.cms,28-03-2024,"Brands
are aggressively expanding to religious cities as growing tourism is attracting retail brands to establish a footprint in these potential market.
Cities like Ayodhya, Ajmer, Katra, Somnath, Shirdi, Mathura, Bodh Gaya, and Madurai have seen entry of brands such as Blackberrys, Manyavar, Spykar, Decathlon and Fab India among others.
According to CBRE, retail brands across segments, including fashion & apparel, food & beverage, hypermarkets, homeware & department stores and consumer electronics brands, are expanding by tailoring the offerings to the pilgrim’s needs.
“Government initiatives to promote tourism and improve connectivity between pilgrimage sites are further boosting this growth. The rise of
online retail platforms
offering easy access to faith-based products and services is also a key factor,” said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman & CEO - India, South-East Asia, Middle East & Africa, CBRE.
This trend reflects a broader shift in
tourist preferences
, with travelers seeking transformative experiences beyond traditional rituals. The rise of urban
spiritual tourism
is catering to this desire, attracting visitors to cities known for their deep religious and spiritual significance.
Live Events
The report identifies Amritsar, Ajmer, Varanasi, Katra, Somnath, Shirdi, Ayodhya, Puri, Tirupati, Mathura, Dwarka, Bodh Gaya, Guruvayur, and Madurai as key cities witnessing this
retail boom
. Retail brands are strategically adapting their offerings in both established mall clusters and high-street locations to cater to the growing tourist population.
The surge in spiritual tourism can be attributed to enhanced infrastructure, including well-connected roads, airports, and public transportation, as well as the development of various accommodation options such as hotels, guesthouses, and wellness centres.
To meet the growing demand for spiritual travel, local governments and businesses are joining forces to create unique retail experiences.
Major hotel chains are also adapting to the evolving preferences of spiritual tourists, offering clean, hygienic, and family-friendly accommodations that command premium pricing.
Several cities have a strong pipeline of new hotel projects, with well-known brands like Marriott, Taj, and Hyatt showing keen interest in entering this market. Branded hotels are emerging as key players, offering a blend of comfort and traditional hospitality tailored for spiritual seekers.
In India, a partnership has developed between wellness centres and hospitality brands to serve the needs of spiritual tourism. Wellness centers offer services like yoga and Ayurveda to enhance physical, mental, and spiritual health.
“Driven by the growing popularity of spiritual tourism, investors are flocking to capitalise on the market's potential. This trend has created opportunities for the hospitality and retail sectors to thrive in these destinations,” said Ram Chandnani, Managing Director, Advisory & Transaction Services, CBRE India.

"Consumer commission imposes Rs 35,000 fine on Amazon, retailer",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/consumer-commission-imposes-rs-35000-fine-on-amazon-retailer/articleshow/108798697.cms,26-03-2024,"Observing that
Amazon
does not have an appropriate grievance redressal mechanism and has ""one-sided oppressive"" sale terms, a consumer
commission
here has imposed a
fine
of Rs 35,000 on the online seller and one of its retailers for deficiencies in services. The commission has also directed Amazon to provide a foolproof and transparent grievance redressal mechanism to customers.
The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (East Delhi) was hearing a complaint from a person for the inordinate delay of around a year and five months in refunding the price of a defective laptop.
The laptop worth Rs 77,990, ordered through Amazon Seller Services Private Limited, was sold by retailer
Appario Retail Private Limited
, the complaint said, adding that the delay in getting the refund for the product caused the consumer mental agony and harassment.
""This commission is of the firm view that opposite party 1 (Amazon), who accepts orders from customers, places the orders to the third party and concludes the contract once the goods are delivered, is not a simple intermediary,"" the commission, headed by president S S Malhotra, said.
The commission, also comprising members Rashmi Bansal and Ravi Kumar, took note of the evidence before it, according to which the refund was initiated ""almost after one year and five months after much deliberation by the complainant"".

""It is also established that OP1 is not having an appropriate grievance redressal mechanism and phone numbers of the concerned persons are not provided on its website, which amounts to a deficiency of service on its part. This is also observed from the terms and conditions (titled 'Conditions of Use') of OP1 that it has been using one-sided oppressive terms of contract which amounts to unfair trade practice on its part,"" the commission said.
As the
retailer
or second opposite party (OP2) sold a defective product, it was also liable for deficiencies in service, it added.
""OP1 and OP2 are directed to pay compensation to the complainant for its deficient service and unfair trade practice that has caused mental agony and harassment to the complainant to the tune of Rs 35,000,"" the commission said in a recent order.
It also asked them to pay Rs 10,000 as litigation costs.
Regarding future sale transactions, the commission directed Amazon ""to make the provisions for handing over the receipt of the pick-up item to the customers"" to provide a ""safe and secure pickup"" to the customers.
Amazon was also directed ""to display on its site the complete detail of the officers dealing with the grievances of the complainants or customers and provide a foolproof transparent grievance redressal mechanism"".

They failed to buy Birkin bags. so they sued,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/they-failed-to-buy-birkin-bags-so-they-sued/articleshow/108754728.cms,24-03-2024,"If you want to buy a Birkin bag, the piece de resistance from French luxury retailer
Hermes
, you should know that you probably can't.
Vogue delivered this tough-love message to readers in a recent article that described the quest for an Hermes bag as ""daunting"". The magazine cautioned that customers ""might wait months or years for the right style to become available"" and further dashed hopes by noting that ""waiting lists at Hermes stores no longer exist"".
The
exclusivity
of the item is very much part of its appeal - but a pair of
California residents
who have struck out in their attempts to buy the bags have decided that enough is enough.
On Tuesday, the two shoppers in question, Tina Cavalleri and Mark Glinoga, filed a proposed
class-action lawsuit
against Hermes in San Francisco. In the complaint, they accuse the company of holding back the coveted bag for all but the highest-spending customers, a practice that, the plaintiffs argue, violates
antitrust law
.
Hermes did not reply to requests for comment.

Cavalleri, who is identified in the
lawsuit
as a California resident, is the owner of at least one Birkin bag, according to the legal complaint. But she was thwarted in her attempt to buy a second.
The lawsuit says that Cavalleri ""has spent tens of thousands of dollars at Hermes, and had been coerced into purchasing"" other Hermes items, described as ""ancillary products,"" before she was given a chance to buy a Birkin bag.
Glinoga, who is also identified as a California resident, had no luck when he tried to buy a Birkin bag, the suit says. An Hermes sales associate instructed him ""to purchase other items and accessories"" at the store before he would be considered as a potential customer for the much sought-after item, according to the suit.
A new one retails for upward of $10,000; vintage examples have fetched as much as $450,000 at auction. Another popular Hermes bag, the Kelly, is named after film star (and Princess of Monaco) Grace Kelly.
At the heart of the lawsuit is the practice of ""tying"" - that is, the selling of a certain item to customers on the condition that they buy another product from the same business.
""The law says it's illegal,"" said Shaun Setareh, a lawyer involved in the suit on behalf of the two plaintiffs. ""They're preconditioning buying other products - scarves, belts, shoes, perfume, jewellery - before they give you the opportunity to buy a Birkin or a Kelly.""
Douglas Hand, a lawyer in New York who works with fashion brands including Stella McCartney and Rag & Bone, said in a phone interview that the definition of ""tying"" was somewhat amorphous, and that the law allowed some room for goods to be sold in a bundle.
A judge, he said, is also more likely to rule that a sales practice violates the law when the item in question can be deemed a necessity. An example might include a drug company that predicates access to lifesaving medication only to those who buy it along with other products.
""There's not as many reasons for why every consumer needs access to a Birkin bag or any specific luxury item,"" Hand continued. ""What the consumer wants out of that is access to class, access to exclusivity and access to a club that you gain entry into.""
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the distinction between bundling and illegal tying could be tricky to parse.
""That's why the outcome will be very, very important to Rolex, Porsche and every luxury brand that has predicated access to the most exclusive items on purchasing less exclusive, unrelated items,"" Hand said.

Amazon India to revise seller fees from April 7,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazon-india-to-revise-seller-fees-from-april-7/articleshow/108729000.cms,23-03-2024,"Amazon India
has notified sellers that it will change its fee structures from April 7, with several categories set to attract higher fees depending on the price of the product.
In its latest notification to sellers, Amazon said it was revising a variety of fees around shipping, referrals, and tech costs. ET has seen a copy of the notification sent to the sellers.
Such fees, charged from sellers for every item sold on the platform, are an important source of revenue for the
ecommerce major
. The e-tailer makes such resetting periodically, with the last update coming in May 2023. Sometimes, sellers tend to pass on the hit from such fee hikes to customers through higher product pricing.
A variety of categories like car electronics, camera accessories, keyboards and mouses, and personal care appliances went from a single flat price to a tiered price system. Categories such beauty products like moisturiser and sunscreen (range starting at 6.5% against 2.5% earlier), grocery and gourmet gifts (range starting at 9% vs at 6% earlier), doors and windows (a flat 10% vs a range starting at 5% earlier) and 3D printers (flat 10% now vs 7% earlier) were among the steepest hikes.
In a statement, Amazon India said
seller fees
and incentives were “strong long-term levers” that would help individual businesses and the marketplace. “These changes reflect our commitment to make Amazon.in one of the most preferred marketplaces for selling in India and creating right choices for sellers to grow efficiently,” the statement added.

A few categories also saw a slight decrease, like inverter and batteries (4.5% now against 5.5% earlier) and fragrances (range starting at 12.5% now against flat 14% earlier).
A spokesperson for Amazon said seller fees and incentives were “strong long-term levers” that would help individual businesses and the marketplace. “These changes reflect our commitment to make Amazon.in one of the most preferred marketplaces for selling in India and creating right choices for sellers to grow efficiently,” the person added.
Shipping prices
were also revised by the firm. The range of prices for ‘easy ship’ and ‘self-ship’ services will now be between Rs 4 and Rs 80, against Rs 3 and Rs 70 earlier. The upper limit for ‘seller flex’ service has been pushed to Rs 61, from Rs 58 earlier. The technology fee per unit has inched up to Rs 14 from Rs 13 earlier.
The firm also removed the Zero Fee fulfilment policy and will now charge a weight handling and shipping fee for standard-sized shipments costing over Rs 20,000.
Amazon Seller Services, the entity that runs the Amazon marketplace and relies on revenue streams like seller fees, posted a 3.4% increase in revenue to Rs 22,198 crore in the financial year ended March 31, 2023, while its loss widened by about a third to Rs 4,854 crore.
On February 12, ET reported that Amazon infused Rs 830 crore into Amazon Seller Services as part of an overall Rs 1,000 crore investment into Indian entities so far this year.

"Flipkart tweaks merit approach, converts hikes into payouts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/flipkart-tweaks-merit-approach-converts-hikes-into-payouts/articleshow/108681366.cms,21-03-2024,"India’s largest ecommerce company
Flipkart
has made a one-time change to its increment policy this year, giving merit-linked
payouts
to all eligible
employees
in Grade 12 (mid-management) and below, instead of the usual pay hikes.
In effect, employees will get two lump sum payments in April and October this year, equivalent in value to the
salary
increase that would have otherwise been paid out throughout the year. About 19,000-20,000 employees would benefit from this, a Flipkart executive told ET.
The company will also roll out 100% bonuses to all its employees this year. Employees who are promoted will receive
increments
as usual, across grades. For the rest of the grades, the company has enabled wider spread of
ESOP
allocation to drive wealth creation.
The details of the new
compensation
structure have been sent out by Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy to employees in a letter. ET has seen a copy of the letter.
“The company multiplier for the
bonus
payout is typically arrived at by measuring the company’s performance against key business parameters, which are GMV, contribution margin, net promoter score, EBITDA and people metrics (attrition and inclusion and diversity)... We have decided to keep the 2023 company multiplier at 100% for all employees (including VPs and SVPs),” the letter said.
Live Events
“At Flipkart, we have always prioritised what’s right for both our employees and the organisation at large, and this compensation review cycle is in line with this intention. We are providing compensation increases to employees getting promoted,
merit-linked
payments and bonus payouts. Additionally, our
stock option
allocation exercise will continue as is, for those who are eligible,” said a statement from the ecommerce major.
“This (merit-linked payouts) appears to be a case of lump sum payouts and not fixed increases in pay. This enables companies to manage fixed cost increases by ensuring salary on which retirals etc are based does not increase but the employee also does not lose because this lump sum amount ensures cash flow remains consistent,” said a consultant on the condition of anonymity.
Last year, Flipkart had frozen hikes of 30% staff including senior leadership among tough macroeconomic conditions. In January 2024, ET had reported that Flipkart has begun a workforce reduction exercise that could see its total team size decrease by 5-7% and be completed by March-April as part of performance reviews. An estimated 1,000 employees would be impacted by this.

grew over 12% year-on-year in 2022-23, clocking an overall industry
turnover
of Rs 21,282 crore, an annual
survey
report released by the Indian Direct Selling Association (
IDSA
) and compiled by market researcher Kantar said on Wednesday.
The report noted that the sector grew 8.3% by CAGR in the four-year period between 2019-20 and 2022-23.
According to the report,
wellness
and
nutraceutical products
contributed 73.5%, while
cosmetics
and personal care accounted for 11.3% of the industry’s overall turnover. The number of active direct sellers touched around 86 lakh from 84 lakh in 2021–22, the survey said.
Vivek Katoch, chairperson of IDSA, said in a statement: “The direct selling industry is poised to strengthen further in the years to come on the back of a promising regulatory framework by the government.”
India ranked 11th in the global direct selling ranking in 2022, up from 15th in 2019.
Live Events
Direct selling companies sell to consumers through direct-seller members and not through retailers. Amway, Oriflame, Herbalife and other direct selling companies have been pushing for tighter regulation and clarity from the government, to differentiate them from multi-level-marketing ponzi companies.
Mid last year, the consumer affairs ministry modified the Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules, 2021, through a notification, to distinguish between fraudulent pyramid and money-circulation schemes and legitimate, direct-selling players. IDSA executives have said further clarity is needed in the definition of 'network of sellers'.

Given the S curve of the expected increase in per capita income from $2500 today to $5500 by 2030 - similar to China's trends, we anticipate the BPC (beauty and personal care) per capita spend to go from $15 today to $50 by 2030. As a reference, Nykaa's BPC spend is currently $80 vs the country's average BPC spend of $15.""

February 2024
showed a growth of mere 5% as compared to the
sales levels
in February 2023, according to the survey by
Retailers Association of India
(RAI).
In categories, sports goods reported a growth of 9% followed by footwear (8%) and QSR (7%) as compared to sales levels in February 2023.
""Customers seem to spend cyclically across categories and regions. East of India was showing strong growth for most part of the financial year, but seems to have weakened over the last couple of months. Similarly, CDIT products growth seem to face headwinds in the last quarter while it grew well in the first three quarters,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI).
Overall consumers are recalibrating purchases based on various categories of spending across the stated categories as well as travel and capital expenditure like automobiles and housing purchases.
“What we also gather is that the middle-class consumers are stretching their budgets, thanks to easy availability of finance and then are recalibrating their expenditure based on EMI outflows,” said Rajagopalan.

Retail businesses across regions have indicated growth in sales as compared to the February 2023 sales level with the highest in West and South India signaling growth of 6% each, while North India indicated a growth of 4% followed by East India signalling a growth of only 3%.

""It's a powerhouse in digital and to be honest, I am inspired by the creativity of the production, the experiences, which makes it interesting for the world,"" she said, adding ""I am very impressed by the know-how, which has been acquired progressively.""
Manufacturing of bikes is not easy and India is now manufacturing it. It is also manufacturing backpacks, tents to textiles and this range would continue to increase, she added.
Decathlon has plans to increase the local sourcing to 85 per cent in the next two years of the sports goods sold in India from the present 60 per cent.
""Currently 65 per cent of what is produced in India (by Decathlon) is exported. That part would grow bigger and continue to grow,"" Coppola added.
When asked about Decathlon's growth driver in India, she said there are different factors. Now overall society is getting into sports.""
Earlier, only 5 per cent of the Indian population was participating in sports, however, now this is having a high growth with the adoption of different sports.
""This has especially become popular in the middle class,"" Coppola said, adding there are more avenues for sporting also in India.
This is also helped by factors such as a rise in income, leading to ""more wealth, more spending on sports and leisure"".
""Now India has more unicorns, experiences and know-how that exist in the ecosystem of India, there are fantastic opportunities and sports is one of the industries, which is exploding. There would be many more,"" she added.
Decathlon's app clocked nearly 29 million downloads in India, Coppola said, adding that the brand has been able to offer ""one of the best omni-channel experiences"", which includes not only selling sports goods but also offering space for sports-related activities at its stores.
Decathlon, which is the official partner of the Paris 2024
Olympics
, would be delighted if India gets a chance to host this major international multi-sport event, said Coppola.
The Indian government is bidding to host the Olympics in 2036.
Decathlon entered India in 2009 as a cash-and-carry retailer and was approved for single-brand retail in 2013 by the government.
For the financial year ended March 31, 2023,
Decathlon India
's sales were at Rs 3,995 crore, registering a 37 per cent growth.

How people's reluctance to take phone calls is affecting companies and gig workers in particular,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/how-peoples-reluctance-to-take-phone-calls-is-affecting-companies-and-gig-workers-in-particular/articleshow/108551821.cms,17-03-2024,"Two weeks ago, Annkur P Agarwal’s credit card was temporarily blocked by his bank. An email from the bank cited a suspicious transaction as the reason. “Apologies if we jumped the gun here. We did try to reach you, but couldn’t get through,” the mail said. Agarwal remained unreachable because he had activated a setting on his iPhone that silences calls from unknown numbers. Since enabling this feature a year ago, he has missed several parcel deliveries, including that of a new iPhone. Lately, he has added his colleague’s number to his Amazon Business profile,requesting them to attend to the calls of delivery agents so that office products reach on time.
Why does he take such extreme measures? “The
spam calls
were getting too much to bear,” says Agarwal, who runs a media company in Pune. “Further, tele-scams have gotten so innovative that it scares me. I thought this was better than to always have my guard up,” he says. Agarwal is thrilled that WhatsApp, too, allows filtering of unknown callers. “That was a loophole scammers and spammers used to get through to me despite the iPhone setting,” he adds. It is not just him. “I’ve noticed even my mother is wary of picking calls from unknown numbers because she keeps hearing about digital scammers targeting unwitting senior citizens.”
The surge in spam and fear of scams via phone calls have resulted in a widespread tendency to ignore calls from unknown numbers across age groups. Consequently, not only promotional calls but crucial transactional calls are also going unattended. Customer data analytics firms note that one out of three calls from consumer-facing companies enquiring about a recent or ongoing transaction goes unanswered.
Ecommerce and logistics firms note a comparable drop in calls for deliveries longer than same-day or next-day, leaving
gig workers
hassled and late for their next drop. Businesses are trying to find ways to adapt to this change, all the while finding ways to get consumers to pick up important calls.
Many apps now proactively inquire about users’ communication preferences. Tinder users have the option to define their communication style in their bios. Data from the company, from January 1 to March 10, 2024, reveals that phone calls rank third among the preferred communication methods of Tinder users in India, trailing behind in-person meetings and WhatsApp chats.
Live Events
Urban Company has “introduced options on its app for users to indicate their preference for minimal phone calls regarding bookings,” says Abhinav Garg, associate director of product at the home service marketplace. “This preference is then nudged to service professionals so that they can approach the user through in-app chat instead,” he adds.
Even as companies focus on building and improving their messaging interfaces, calls are sometimes necessary. “In tier-2 and -3 cities, addresses fed by consumers could be 1.5 km from the actual location where the delivery has to be made, so the delivery agent tries to call the customer for navigation assistance to prevent a failed delivery attempt,” says Ashish Sikka, chief strategy officer at Ecom Express, a n ecommerce courier service company. Similarly, in tier-1 cities, delivery agents often initiate calls to facilitate entry into gated buildings or to request OTPs, particularly for high-value items, when customers are unavailable at their addresses.
VERIFIED NUMBERS
To prevent calls from going unanswered, E c o m Express and Urban Company use verified business caller ID services provided by the likes of Truecaller and CallerApp, which allow them to have a bunch of phone numbers marked as verified to increase the chances of users picking up their calls. Sales and marketing professionals tell ET that companies pay anywhere between $10,000 and $250,000 annually for this service. “Such solutions usually lead to an improvement in call pickups by 18%,” says Sikka of Ecom Express. He did not specify the service the company uses U r b a n Company u s e s Truecaller’s verified caller ID service called Truecaller for Business. HDFC Bank also uses Truecaller for Business especially “for urgent and timesensitive matters, particularly those involving transaction monitoring to detect suspicious activities,” says Ravi Santhanam, group head, CMO and head of D2C business at the bank. “These calls [on Truecaller] are distinctly highlighted in purple colour so that customers notice the difference and sense the urgency to pick up the call and get sensitised on a particular transaction,” he adds. There is a purple-coded Truecaller pop-up for calls from food-delivery apps like Swiggy and ridehailing apps like Uber.
Launched in 2021, “Truecaller for Business currently has over 2,500 clients globally,” says Priyam Bose, global head of go to market, Truecaller for Business. “India is our biggest market, followed by others such as Middle East North Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America,” he adds. The clientele includes companies in sectors like retail, ecommerce, food tech, ride-hailing, BFSI, auto and logistics. According to the company’s annual report, Truecaller for Business earned roughly $16.6 million in revenue in 2023, up 61% from the previous year.
With roughly 259 million monthly active users in India, Truecaller captures roughly 31% of 820 million internet users in the country. However, users can still mark a company’s verified number as spam on the app and the number of spam reports will be visible every time that verified number calls a Truecaller user.
CallerApp is an Israeli caller ID company, which is one-fifth the size of Truecaller and has a limited presence in India.
IN-APP CALLS GO UP
Some large enterprises, in sectors like food tech and financial services are showing interest in building in-app calling capability like Uber, says Jacob Joseph, VP–data science at CleverTap, a consumer engagement platform. “Brands want to adopt ways that either bring the cost down or increase revenue, all the while maintaining trust and adhering to data privacy. In-app VoIP (voice over internet protocol) calls are not only a privacy-friendly feature but also come at a fraction of the cost of regular, outbound calls,” he adds.
So far, Uber is the only major consumer-facing company to have in-app calling, which it launched in India in 2019 as a cost-efficient and privacy-focused feature. But it hasn’t entirely solved the issue of riders not answering a driver’s call, says Shaik Salauddin, founder, Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union.
“Customers tend to avoid answering driver calls to conceal destination and payment method, fearing ride cancellation,” he says. “During morning peak hours, many book from multiple apps. The customer boards whichever app’s vehicle comes first and ignores the other driver’s call to avoid cancellation fees. The drivers then have to cancel these rides, which increases their cancellation rate, impacting their ratings.” Uber declined to participate in the story.
As businesses adapt to consumer’s changing phone habits, they will have to set strict rules for calling, says Ayisha Patnaik, a product manager specialising in customer growth and retention. Her suggestions include seeking explicit permission to place a call, checking time preference for a call and switching to an alternate mode of communication after one call goes unanswered. Even though this change makes her job harder, Patnaik favours it because it corresponds to a broader cultural change concerning making and taking calls.
THOU SHALT NOT CALL
According to several international studies, millennials brought in the trend of texting over calling, and got labelled as “Generation Mute”, roughly around 2018. Gen Z seems to have taken it to the next level.
“One of my closest friends has her phone on DND [do not disturb] mode so that she doesn’t get any calls even when she is scrolling Instagram,” says Bhumika Khatri, a 20-something management professional at a SaaS company in Delhi. Khatri, too, is not a fan of calls, a sentiment that has exacerbated since the pandemic. “I think during Covid we lost the boundaries of work and life, and so we are constantly trying to optimise our time, which means everything is agenda-driven, including impromptu calls.” Taking calls increasingly feels like stepping out of her comfort zone to Khatri. “I don’t want to give my time that easily,” she adds.
Farah Maneckshaw, a psychologist from Bengaluru who works with younger clients has seen how this trend manifests during her sessions. “It’s rare for my clients to receive a call or take one during our session,” she says, indicating it happens often with peers who work with relatively older clients. “So many times, clients go, “let me read out the text for you” for significant stuff you would think someone would want to discuss over a call,” she adds.
While psychologists attribute this decline in calling culture to dwindling attention spans and technology making calls cheap and omnipresent, the ties to the pandemic are not tenuous. “Phone calls were correlated with news then, most often bad news,” says Anshuma Kshetrapal, a creative arts psychotherapist from Delhi. “Clients who were already anxious about taking calls are more so now,” she adds. “As for the rest, they, too, are questioning people’s choice of calling over texting because we are receiving too much information, so people have become more demanding of the way they want to receive it. They want to receive it in a shorter format, to the point.”
But where does this expectation of always being to the point take us, she wonders. “The scope of meandering during a conversation, which would help in building relationship, takes a hit,” she says. Agarwal from Pune feels his tendency to do only agenda-based calls, while essential in an increasingly overwhelming world, is affecting his ability to strike up a conversation with strangers in real life. “These days, when I go for a wedding or any other event where one has to make and receive calls for the sake of logistics, I undo my silence unknown caller settings,” he says. “Good to get out of your comfort zone every once in a while.”

India to be among top 5 markets for Decathlon in next 5 years; to increase local sourcing to over 90 pc: Top exec,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-to-be-among-top-5-markets-for-decathlon-in-next-5-years-to-increase-local-sourcing-to-over-90-pc/articleshow/108456369.cms,13-03-2024,"PARIS: India is a ""big priority"" market for
Decathlon
, and the
French sports retailer
expects the country to be among its top five global markets within the next five years, helped by expansion of store network and increased local sourcing, according to a top company official. Decathlon, as part of its growth plans, will add 10 new stores every year in India, while accelerating

""We want a good rhythm of (opening) 10 stores per year. We are really accelerating online at the moment and positioning ourselves digitally because of the convenience element,"" he said, adding besides large format stores, Decathlon is also working on small stores in big cities.
These new stores could be smaller stores between 1,000 to 2,000 square meters or could also be large experience stores spread across 4,000 square meters, with a bigger play area and other amenities.
""We have two in Bengaluru at the moment but we feel that in cities like Mumbai and Delhi, we should follow that kind of concept,"" he added.
The leading
sports retailer
also believes it has a role to play by encouraging more people towards sports and creating a market in India.
Decathlon, which competes with leading athleisure brands such as
Nike
,
Adidas
, Reebok, Puma and Asics in the Indian market, is currently operating around 100 stores across formats.
Regarding the potential of the Indian market, Dykes said India has a high number of young people in its demography, who are looking at sports as a career option.
Moreover, there are some big Indian cities such as Mumbai, whose GDP is expected to be broadly equal to countries like Romania. ""We would like to treat these cities like a country,"" he said.
Moreover, cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata etc follow different kinds of sports passions. For example, in cities like Hyderabad Badminton is popular, while running is picking up in Delhi. Similarly, Mumbai and Kolkata have different sports passions.
Over domestic sourcing, Dykes said Decathlon plans to increase it to 90 to 95 per cent.
""We put a vision to get there in about five years by 2028,"" said Dykes, who earlier led the India business of Decathlon as its CEO there.
The company is increasing its accessibility and working on the value chain with more ""sustainable components"" for the Indian market, which is price-sensitive.
On Tuesday, Decathlon launched a brand new identity and said it is deploying a new strategy steeped in its new purpose, ""Move People Through the Wonders of Sport"".
Speaking at the press meet, Barbara Martin Coppola, Global CEO, Decathlon said, ""Anchored to this new purpose, we have created a new strategy to concretely evolve many aspects of our business. This includes recreating our customer experience, accelerating the movement towards sustainability, and modernising our company end-to-end.""
She added that the brand structure is also evolving to reflect its new identity as a global, multi-specialist sports brand.

Indian wedding season: Branded retailers celebrate rising demand for accessories,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indian-wedding-season-branded-retailers-celebrate-rising-demand-for-accessories/articleshow/108408985.cms,12-03-2024,"Mumbai | New Delhi: From safa and mala to jooti and brooch, the quintessential Indian wedding is now incomplete without a touch of
royalty
for the bridegroom and even his immediate family and friends, making such
accessories
make-or-break accompaniments for wedding collection
brands
.
""While it (accessories) accounts for just 7-8% of the wedding collection sales, customers will just walk off the store if these products don't match their outfits worth a few lakhs. These accessories are a make or break for brands,"" said Mayank Mohan, owner of ethnic menswear brand Mohanlal Sons. ""While we sell mala, we had discontinued imitation jewellery earlier, but are now planning to reintroduce them.""
The market for occasion wear was historically serviced more by local shops or made-to-order ones, but over the past decade brands such as Manyavar, Mohanlal, Tasva and Ethnix by Raymond have brought consistency in the celebration wear segment in terms of delivery and execution. But what started with apparels has now trickled down to accessories customers would pick to go with their attire.
Moti malas and safas, or turbans, have become crucial in accessorising the look for the groom's special day. So, these styling products present a strong
business
case for
portfolio
expansion for wedding dress brands. Even friends and guests are sporting these accessories at Indian weddings.
""We are not in the business of just selling sherwanis, kurtas, jootis and stoles, and instead focus on the entire look,"" said Sunil Kataria, chief executive of Raymond Lifestyle that owns Ethnix. ""As part of the selling process, this is an important part of training. It is a must for the groom because his entire ensemble hinges on the accessories. So, when you are selling a sherwani or occasion wear, the whole outfit as a style goes together. If these don't match, then the sale gets rejected,"" he said. According to management consulting firm Wazir Advisors, the apparel and accessories market in India was estimated at $75 billion in FY23, and the total ethnic wear market represented nearly 30% at $22 billion.

"Majority of D2C businesses still not profitable, shows a study",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/majority-of-d2c-businesses-still-not-profitable-shows-a-study/articleshow/108290041.cms,07-03-2024,"A survey conducted by MMA India and Publicis Commerce shows that 80% of
direct-to-consumer
(D2C) businesses are yet to attain profitability, while 63% are not profitable at all.
The survey released on Wednesday added that only 12% of the D2C businesses have reported being profitable, while 25% of the D2C businesses said that they don't measure profitability since they are part of larger ecosystems.
Publicis Groupe
CEO for South Asia, Anupriya Acharya said ecommerce is the fastest-growing segment for the company as the number of shoppers increases and consumer spending on e-commerce grows.Acharya said that the D2C Toolkit Advantage report has been launched since commerce has become one of the most important agendas for clients.
""A lot of our clients are seeking our expertise for their D2C strategy. Many of our clients have traditional infrastructure. They have moved to marketplaces, and now they want to move into D2C,” she added.
D2C is gaining prominence as an ecommerce channel with 43% of e-commerce funding in 2022 going to these businesses, overtaking marketplaces as the most funded e-commerce sub-sector.
Live Events
Performics India CEO Lalatendu Das said very few companies have cracked the code to run a profitable
D2C business
due to high customer acquisition costs, unclear return on investment, and operational complexity.
“Our survey shows that nearly 80% of D2C businesses are yet to attain profitability. About 12% of them are profitable, 63% are not profitable at all, and 25% said the D2C business is part of a bigger ecosystem, therefore they don't measure profitability,” he noted.
Das mentioned that profitable D2C ventures are doing four things right.
“If these four things are done right, you are looking at an operating profit of roughly 8%,” he said.
This includes investing in consumer insights and using them in multiple ways to drive sales, collecting first-party data to understand consumers better, driving brand affinity, and driving product innovation based on consumer insights.

When online goes offline: Why brick-and-mortar is back in fashion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/when-online-goes-offline-why-brink-and-mortar-is-back-in-fashion/articleshow/108243415.cms,05-03-2024,"The wave of e-commerce triggered by India's new digital payment infrastructure and deeper penetration of the internet turned into a tsunami during the pandemic when people stayed locked in homes for long periods. But now it seems the brick-and-mortar retail is back with stores starting to regain their importance.
Even direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, which are born and brought up on the internet, are choosing the
omnichannel route
by opening up
retail stores
. Millet-based snack brand Slurrp Farm, cosmetics makers Just Herbs and Sugar Cosmetics, lingerie brand Zivame, eyewear retailer Lenskart, wearables brand boAt and beauty retailer
Nykaa
are among those which have opened
physical stores
, ET has reported. Ghazal Alagh, co-founder of
Mamaearth
, one of India's most prominent
D2C brands
, wrote on social media platform X last month that her brand now has over 1.7 lakh retail touch points.
Beauty retailer Nykaa's offline store count was 150 in 2022-23, having grown from 72
offline stores
within two years. For audio wearables company boAt, nearly one third of its Rs 4,000-crore sales now come from offline stores.
Why is brick-and-mortar retail back in fashion? The customer wants to touch and feel, especially when it comes to expensive items.
Physical stores getting bigger
Live Events
Retailers across categories are opening bigger bricks-and-mortar stores along with expanding their existing stores as consumers are increasingly looking for a better experience in physical retail. According to data from real estate services firm Anarock, the share of stores smaller than 2,000 square feet declined to 52% in the first half of 2023-24, as against 61% a year ago.
The share of stores sized 2,000-5,000 sq ft increased during this period, to 21% from 19%, as did that of those sized 5,000-10,000 sq ft (11% from 9%) and 10,000-15,000 sq ft (13% from 9%).
Anarock said last year that retailers across categories are adopting a two-pronged approach by expanding and entering newer markets and also increasing their store sizes to capitalize on the growing share of the organised retail market.
“Store is now more about experience than merchandising. Brands have realised that, and by expanding the store they are expanding the offering,” Pankaj Renjhen, COO and joint MD, Anarock Retail, had said.
“Today, shopping is more than just a mere transaction; consumers expect an overall pleasant buying experience. Ample in-store space allows for a wider selection of products and fosters an inviting atmosphere that elevates the
shopping experience
to newer heights,” Tushar Ved, President of Apparel Group India Pvt Ltd which sells brands such as Aldo, Canadian lingerie and sleepwear brand, la Vie en Rose, Charles & Keith and Bath & Body Works in India, had told ET three months ago.
Bigger stores mean higher rentals for retailers and they need more footfall to increase the revenue. However, the conversion rate matters more than footfall, according to retailers.
Retail sector leasing at record high
The retail sector recorded an all-time high leasing in 2023, taking 7.1 million sq ft across eight cities, an increase of 47% from last year despite large retailers slowing down on store expansion, ET has reported.
According to CBRE, about two dozen international brands entered India and expansion by global brands that are already present in the country have fuelled the demand.
Retail leasing
by international brands is almost 25% in 2023 compared to 14% in the previous year.
The total retail supply also reached a historic peak at 6 million sq ft in 2023, over 316% Y-o-Y increase. This rise in supply can be attributed to the commencement of operations of 12 investment-grade malls located in Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Delhi-NCR and Chennai. The retail leasing in 2023 was predominantly steered by fashion & apparel, with a 32% share in total leasing. This was largely influenced by mid-range fashion value and athleisure brands.
The physical retail market has a robust supply of nearly 41 million sq ft of retail developments scheduled to be operational between 2024 and 2028 across top seven cities of India, as per a recent JLL study.
Growth in online active users halves
The tsunami of e-commerce has turned into a wave. Growth in the number of active users for the top 20
online retailers
more than halved last calendar year, reversing the surge seen during the pandemic as shoppers shift to brick-and-mortar stores, as per a report by Boston Consulting Group and Retailers Association of India.
There were 499 million active user base in these online firms in 2023, higher than 455 in 2022. However, at 10%, the pace of growth was a five-year low compared to 22-55% growth between 2019-2022, says the report.
One-time boost during the pandemic driven by mobility restrictions has waned even as a funding winter continues in e-commerce with 58% drop in deals in 2023 against the previous year, ET has reported.
The slowdown in new user addition on e-commerce post-COVID period acceleration, the report says, could be due to the consumers partially switching back to offline.
Enhanced shopping experience is the key to adding more customers. The report gives an example of an American fashion retailer which offers superior customer experience through advanced phygital fitting-room solutions. It has ""magic wardrobes"" in dressing rooms with two-way doors for discreet item delivery and touchscreen in each fitting room to replace size/choose different colour from the available inventory. Store assistants can scan & directly deliver garments to the fitting room.

"Fashion, apparel retailers cut discounts amid subdued demand, low inventory",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/fashion-apparel-retailers-cut-discounts-amid-subdued-demand-low-inventory/articleshow/108239873.cms,06-03-2024,"Leading fashion and apparel retailers are reducing their
discount
when demand continues to be subdued and their inventory much lower than earlier by cautious procurement in the last 2-3 quarters, to focus more on margins and profit, chief executives said.
These companies feel when store footfalls are weak, there is no need to provide additional discounts and instead focus on premiumisation of these consumers.
One of the largest apparel retailers and manufacturers, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail managing director Ashish Dikshit said there is a slowdown which is reflected in the footfalls into malls and stores. The company has decided to scale down on discounting which has helped to significantly expand margins last quarter, he told investors recently.
“We recognized that in this market situation, it would be a sharper strategy to stay tight on discounts, manage for profitability, which is what we have done. So we were able to make the most of the footfalls, which came into the stores, which was linked with the premiumization strategy,” said Dikshit, who runs stores like Pantaloons and sells brands like Allen Solly, Reebok and host of ethnic designer brands like Sabyasachi and Masaba.
Live Events
Arvind Fashions
, which sells brands like Arrow, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, too has rationalized discounting at its stores. The company’s managing director Shailesh Chaturvedi said the company’s revenue growth last quarter could have been higher if it had participated in early end-of-season sales (EOSS) but instead made a choice to focus on profitability and discount reduction due to tight control on inventory.
“We also made a choice of increasing marketing investment by 130 basis points in order to support growth and keep our brands top of mind. We chose investment in marketing over investment into discounting,” Chaturvedi told analysts. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.
For Arvind Fashions, the growth in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) last quarter was 18% due to lower discounting while Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail achieved consolidated EBITDA of Rs 605 crore with margin expansion of 150 basis points to reach 14.5% versus 13% last year same period.
Sales of
apparel brands
and retailers have been impacted since November 2022 after a massive surge in demand post Covid led by wardrobe refresh. The sudden lull in demand caught all brands unaware whereby they were stuck with piles of unsold inventory forcing everyone to cut down on sourcing and clear stock with frequent and high discounting.
Demand did not revive even last festive season with brands saying the cricket matches during the ICC World Cup then impacted demand severely. But almost all brands managed to reduce their inventory levels with lower sourcing.
Shoppers Stop
’s apparel value retail format Intune business head Devang Parikh told analysts that this new format has beaten all estimates on the number of full price sell-through. The retailer did not go for any major discounting in the last EOSS.
“We may have some liquidation as is the nature of the business and everyone needs to. But we don't see the need for a very aggressive EOSS in Intune as of now,” he said.

""When a pure play online brand goes into offline, it needs to adapt itself to the new channel at multiple levels, starting with the product assortment itself,"" said Arush Chopra, CEO of Just Herbs, in which fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company
Marico
has invested. ""Products that sell well online may not do as well offline as you are not catering to the 'long tail' niche customer anymore. So tweaks are required in the product strategy.""
According to Chopra, when brands look to go offline through the distributed route, they need to win the trust of the trade participants and if the brand has an existing online pull, it certainly helps. ""Having the right team to execute and educate the consumer is also critical. You sometimes need seasoned folks from legacy offline businesses rather than people with startup experience to do so. So you need a team that has the agility of a startup and the experience and depth of knowledge of a legacy company,"" he said.
Challenges for such internet-first brands going offline come when they scale up for larger distribution to general trade.
""Offline is a tough model,"" said Rajat Wahi, partner at Deloitte India. ""All stores are of different sizes in India, and one needs to understand the nuances of how to manage inventories, damages and so on.""
For digital-first brands, though, supplying directly to retail points through their warehouses or directly shipping from their own distribution centres is easier.
Some D2C brands were acquired by large companies and riding on the distribution muscle of those companies, they plan to double their retail footprint over the next 12-24 months.
""Our offline business grew from 400 to 5,000 stores between 2022-23, and we're targeting a retail footprint of 40,000 stores by 2026. Overall revenue has doubled every year for the last three years and offline currently accounts for 30-40%,"" said Meghna Narayan, co-founder of Wholsum Foods, which makes Slurrp Farm healthy mixes.
Offline still holds value
In an increasingly digital world, the value of physical touchpoints cannot be understated, said Chaitanya Ramalingegowda, co-founder of Wakefit.co, which makes premium mattresses and sleep solutions. ""We have strategically expanded our offline footprint, now with over 50 stores nationwide. While our online platforms ensure convenience and accessibility, our offline stores serve as hubs of interaction and strong engagement where customers can touch, feel and experience the quality of our products first hand,"" he said.
""We have observed that our offline AOV (average order value) is two times higher than our online AOV, said Ramalingegowda. ""Online platforms are excellent avenues for research and data collection, while offline touchpoints offer families the opportunity to make collective decisions in a high-involvement category like home and sleep solutions.""
Hiring is key to topping up in physical retail, said executives.
""Traditional retail is all about strong trade relationships. The retailers and distributors have to be comfortable working with your sales team and hiring experienced folks certainly helps here,"" said Chopra of Just Herbs. ""Also, it is very important to hire sales people who specialise in this type of trade. For example, someone with general trade experience may not be suited to do pharmacies or someone with modern trade experience may struggle with general trade where relationships with the trade participants are key.""
Beauty retailer Nykaa's offline store count was 150 in 2022-23, having grown from 72 offline stores within two years. For audio wearables company boAt, nearly one third of its '4,000-crore sales now come from offline stores.

“The solution will enable ubiquity across platforms and provide a ‘one-seller app experience’ without having to download multiple standalone apps,” the spokesperson added.
The product was unveiled at the company’s booth at the recently concluded Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
The company also announced a deeper partnership with Truecaller, a global app for verifying contacts and blocking unwanted communication, that started in 2022, to form a master distributor model for the app’s business messaging platform.
Under the partnership, Tanla aims to help enterprises connect with end-users with messages integrated with images, videos, and documents, and other rich media, tapping into 260-million active user base of Truecaller in India, offering both one-way and two-way communication capabilities.
The messaging service provider has also tied up with Google to offer RCS-based solutions to customers allowing them to leverage the rich-media messaging capabilities of the platform at a much lower cost as compared to WhatsApp.
For RCS, Tanla has designed an interface that allows businesses to send actionable messages to customers, with the option to integrate Google’s generativeAI capabilities to build rich chatbots.

The experience turn: A good news and a bad news for Indian retailers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/the-experience-turn-a-good-news-and-a-bad-news-for-indian-retailers/articleshow/108202584.cms,04-03-2024,"India's
consumer landscape
is shifting in various ways which keeps
retailers
on toes. Recently released Household Consumption Expenditure Survey data showed Indians are spending less on food, particularly staples like rice and wheat, and more on discretionary items such as processed food, as well as durables like televisions and fridges. Already a
premiumisation trend
is sweeping across categories for the past few years.
Charting out shifts in India's
retail sector
, a joint study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and
Retailers Association of India
(
RAI
) brings good news as well as bad news for Indian retailers. The good news is
Indian retailers
have a vast business growth opportunity to capture. India continues to be a bright spot among top global economies with a robust GDP growth of 7% in 2023. It is projected to overtake Germany & Japan to claim the 3rd spot by 2030. Private consumption at the same time remains strong. India retail is expected to reach $2 trillion in the next 10 years and presents a large opportunity for retailers, says the report titled 'Unlocking the $2Tn retail opportunity in the next decade'.
As retail is going through key shifts, the pace of growth is influenced by several factors such as steady growth in disposable incomes, return of store expansion, momentum through small formats, increase in affluence impacting categories differentially, varied mix of volume and average selling price, steady increase in urbanization and relatively slower growth for e-commerce versus recent past. One worrying trend is a discernible shift in spending to experiences and increased savings, says the report. Indian consumers are increasingly spending more on experience than on products, creating an '
experience economy
' which poses a challenge to consumer good retailers despite a vast growth potential ahead.
What is the 'experience economy'?
Live Events
The term 'experience economy' was popularised by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore who wrote in Harvard Business Review in 1998 about the emerging consumer trend in the US.
Pine II and Gilmore described this shift in consumer preference over a long period of time with the example of a cake. ""The entire history of economic progress can be recapitulated in the four-stage evolution of the birthday cake,"" they wrote. ""As a vestige of the agrarian economy, mothers made birthday cakes from scratch, mixing farm commodities (flour, sugar, butter, and eggs) that together cost mere dimes. As the goods-based industrial economy advanced, moms paid a dollar or two to Betty Crocker for premixed ingredients. Later, when the service economy took hold, busy parents ordered cakes from the bakery or grocery store, which, at $10 or $15, cost ten times as much as the packaged ingredients. Now, in the time-starved 1990s, parents neither make the birthday cake nor even throw the party. Instead, they spend $100 or more to “outsource” the entire event to Chuck E. Cheese’s, the Discovery Zone, the Mining Company, or some other business that stages a memorable event for the kids—and often throws in the cake for free. Welcome to the emerging experience economy.""
In India, the experience economy has been unleashed by millennials who would rather choose to go for adventure travel than buying an expensive pair of sneakers.
Today, a recent college grad is likely more interested in a backpacking trip to Machu Picchu or a week on a beach rather than acquiring luxury goods. Experiential spending also got a big boost from the pandemic when people were locked into homes but yearned for experiences when the pandemic faded.
Indians moving from product to experience
The BCG and RAI report shows that service categories have grown at 1.4x CAGR against product categories in the past three years. Product categories include food, beverages & tobacco (fresh food & dairy, staples, packaged foods & beverages, tobacco); clothing & footwear; housing & household products, and health (health goods), while services include medical and health services, transport & communication, education, holidays/entertainment, eating out/ordering food, leisure travel, activity classes, and other services such as insurance premiums and personal care.
Another related challenge for retailers is an increasing share of income on savings/investments. The report points out 28% increase in SIP contribution, 30% growth in demat accounts and 3 percentage point increase in health insurance penetration in the past three years.
In India, the experience economy has been growing for the past few years. A Mastercard Economic Institute report titled ‘Travel 2022: Trends & Transitions’, had highlighted that travellers have begun spending more on experiences than material things. A Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP report too had pointed out the trend in 2021. After spending over a year and a half within the confines of their homes due to the pandemic, Indian consumers were living in the moment and indulging in luxury and experience-oriented spending. The analysis indicated that despite inflation, consumers were prioritising personal care and well-being as the world gradually adjusts itself to a life after the pandemic.
It said 85 per cent consumers planned to spend on leisure travel in the next four weeks; 50 per cent respondents were spending more on experiences than on goods; and 65 per cent consumers felt safe to take a flight and stay in a hotel.
Last year, a Redseer report too had pointed out consumer spending shifting to experiences. Despite pandemic-driven setbacks in the recent past, India's private consumption has been growing stronger since 2019 and reflects an increasing tendency to spend in categories that are driven by prosperity, said the report. It pointed out that Indians were less willing to spend on home upkeep items than splurging on travel.
Probably in response to this trend, Indian retailers are emphasizing on experience while selling goods to consumers. Retailers across categories are opening bigger bricks-and-mortar stores along with expanding their existing stores as consumers are increasingly looking for a better experience in physical retail, real estate services firm Anarock had said a few months ago. According to Anarock data, the share of stores smaller than 2,000 square feet declined to 52% in the first half of 2023-24, as against 61% a year ago. The share of stores sized 2,000-5,000 sq ft increased during this period, to 21% from 19%, as did that of those sized 5,000-10,000 sq ft (11% from 9%) and 10,000-15,000 sq ft (13% from 9%).
“Store is now more about experience than merchandising. Brands have realised that and by expanding the store they are expanding the offering,” Pankaj Renjhen, COO and joint MD, Anarock Retail, had said.

"Indians are saving up to 20% on all lifestyle spends, travel among top categories: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indians-are-saving-up-to-20-on-all-lifestyle-spends-travel-among-top-categories-report/articleshow/108202488.cms,04-03-2024,"Indians are saving upto 20% on all
lifestyle spends
, even as
travel
is the preferred category for
spendvesting
enthusiasts, with
gadgets
and
shopping
also significant, pointing to the popular lifestyle goals that drive
financial decisions
, said Spendvesting report by Multipl.
Spendvesting is a financial concept that combines the principles of investing and spending. The approach, developed by multipl, merges lifestyle goals with investing, helping consumers to live their dream lifestyle while building a secure financial future. It also notes that 50% of Indian spendvestors are in the 26-34 age group, showcasing the strategy’s resonance with millennials and Gen Z.
""Spendvesting is not merely a financial strategy; it represents a shift towards mindful and gainful consumer behavior. As interest and participation in spendvesting grows, it is set to capture a wide ranging audience, capitalising on India’s expected digital economy boom to $1 trillion by 2030,"" said Paddy Raghavan, co-founder of multipl, adding that millennials and Gen Z’s prefer fintech startups for customised investment advice.
The report in collaboration with Blume Ventures, Augmont - Gold for All, DSP Mutual Funds, and EaseMyTrip, tracks the evolution in Indian spending habits, moving away from traditional banking and credit usage towards spendvesting approach, endorsing a positive habit for a stable financial future. It tackles the growing issue of credit card defaults and debt accumulation among younger generations, emphasising the need for financial discipline.
By integrating investments in short-term debt or hybrid mutual funds and digital gold with daily lifestyle spends like travel, gadgets, and insurance, spendvesting seeks to simplify modern financial literacy demands and facilitate healthy and rewarding spending habits through the gains from investments and contributions from partner brands.

NCLT allows 45-day extension for Future unit resolution,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/nclt-allows-45-day-extension-for-future-unit-resolution/articleshow/108147621.cms,02-03-2024,"MUMBAI: The lenders to Kishore Biyani-promoted
Future Supply Chain Solutions
got an extension of 45 days to complete the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) to consider bids from
Reliance Retail Ventures
and
Tatkal Loan India
.
On Friday, the resolution professional of the BSE-listed Future Supply Chain Solutions, Rajan Rawat, sought an extension of 45 days, pleading that two prospective resolution applicants have submitted their bids and lenders have already requested them to increase the value of their plans.
""These plans are under active consideration and lenders are already in talks with the bidders to maximise the value,"" the resolution professional argued through his lawyer.
The division bench of judicial member Lakshmi Gurung and technical member Charanjeet Singh Gulati allowed the request in an oral order. The detailed order was awaited.
Originally, apart from Reliance Retail Ventures and Tatkal Loan India, other bidders such as One City Infrastructure, Globe Ecologistics, Shanti G.D. Ispat & Power, Camions Logistics Solutions and Sugna Metals had shown interest in acquiring the company through the bankruptcy process.

How India and Bharat shop for goods online: A look into the carts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/how-india-and-bharat-shop-for-goods-online-a-look-into-the-carts/articleshow/108135341.cms,01-03-2024,"It may seem so but
online shopping
is no longer primarily a metropolitan phenomenon. Just as growing digital literacy and widespread internet connectivity drive the trend in smaller cities and towns, significant variations are coming up in the purchasing habits, choices, and mindsets of online shoppers nationwide. A recent PwC report has pointed out that
India
's online shopper is no longer a monolithic entity and businesses that sell online need different strategies for shoppers in big cities and those in small cities and towns.
The report, 'How India shops online: Consumer preferences in the metropolises and tier 1-4 cities', divides online shoppers in two distinct categories: those who live in metros and those in the rest of India. It outlines key differences in preferences of online shoppers in these two geographies which can be ignored by digital sellers at their own risk because as e-commerce grows in India these disparities are only going to harden.
What makes them stick
Location can shape buyer preferences in radically different ways. Online shoppers in big cities where traffic jams and long distances are common features of daily life don't value what shoppers in small towns do where distances are shorter.
Urban dwellers, who prioritise speed in online shopping, are particularly drawn to prompt delivery services which meet their demand for instant gratification and are willing to pay a premium price for the same.

But shoppers in the rest of India are keener on deals. These consumers are bargain and discount
hunters because they live in smaller cities where speed of delivery carries little importance due to short distances.
What are they buying?
Interestingly, the rest of India appears to be leading the purchases in the sports and fitness, home and kitchen, and health and wellness categories, whereas residents in metros focus more on grocery, electronics and fashion.
The rise of social media has played a significant role in increasing awareness of these products and with an increase in demand, the platforms introduced new and affordable products to these cities. As incomes in the rest of India improved, so did the spending on these categories.
How do they pay?
Those who live in metro cities and those in the rest of India display comparable acceptance levels of UPI payments, indicating a rise in adoption and familiarity with such payment methods.
However, 'cash on delivery' remains the preferred option among the shoppers in the rest of India to minimise the risk of frauds. This suggests that while there is growing acceptance of UPI payments due to its convenience, speed and security, there are still concerns regarding online platforms and payment methods particularly among shoppers in the rest of India.
Generation X from the rest of India prefers card transactions for mid-high value purchases on well-known platforms due to their direct connection to bank accounts, providing a trusted layer of transaction safety. Paytm is popular among urban dwellers for its user-friendly wallet while PhonePe is preferred by the rest of India because of its intuitive interface. Google Pay ranks second nationwide.
What unites the two categories
Shoppers of both the categories prefer apps to websites to shop online. This is common for all the respondents irrespective of their geographic location. The factors for this preference are ease of navigation, simplified user interface (that complies to global standards) and vernacular support.
Marketplace apps often also get downloaded more since they cater to a wide range of categories. For customer service and assistance consumers prefer human interaction over interacting with chatbots.
Marketplaces or category platforms?
With a combination of fashion and accessories, marketplaces still have a lion’s share of the consumer market irrespective of the geography. Amazon’s market pull in the urban markets beats Myntra’s by a small margin while Flipkart has caught the fancy of the nation in the rest of India followed by Meesho, Amazon and Myntra. This preference for marketplace apps over category-based platforms is a common theme among rest of India respondents highlighting the importance of factors such as deals, discounts, accessibility, user-friendly interfaces and familiarity with the platform.
The need for tailored solutions
Designing experiences that resonate with all the users across the country may not be the best way forward for digital sellers. The e-commerce experience that has worked in the urban centres may not necessarily work for the rest of India. The latter will need a more in-depth, human-centric view that acknowledges and capitalises on the diversity that exists across in these smaller towns and cities.
“The report emphasises the need for tailored e-commerce experiences to resonate with diverse users across India,"" says Prateek Sinha, Partner and Leader - Design and Experience Consulting, PwC India. ""A human-centred approach, coupled with localised strategies and inclusivity, is crucial for success. It’s about connecting with each customer on a personal level, celebrating the rich tapestry of our cultures, and innovating every step of the way. By embracing agility and a deep understanding of consumer dynamics, businesses can chart a trajectory of sustained growth and profitability. When businesses get this right, they’re not just selling products; they’re creating experiences that people love and trust.""

Reliance Industries in talks to bring British fashion retailer Primark to India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-industries-in-talks-to-bring-british-fashion-retailer-primark-to-india/articleshow/108082706.cms,28-02-2024,"NEW DELHI:
Reliance
is in exploratory talks with British
fashion retailer
Primark to bring the label to India, a move that will pit it against Tata's Zudio, Landmark Group-owned Max and
Shoppers Stop
's new value format InTune.
The 55-year-old brand, popular for its moderately priced clothing and shoes, has been evaluating the Indian market for the past few years and may partner Reliance through the joint venture or licensing route, said two people aware of the development. Most of their stores will be on the high street due to its big box format, unlike other global retailers, which prioritise malls, the executives added.
Primark has been a successful value-priced retailer and its global revenue has exploded in the last few years, aside from two Covid-hit years. Average prices are even cheaper than retailers such as H&M and
Uniqlo
. While China is the largest source country for Primark, India is second in the number of small to large factories that supply the company. Nearshoring is already embedded in Primark's supply chain strategy, and it can deliver goods from Indian suppliers directly to a local retail unit for cost control and flexibility while being responsive to local market needs.
As the largest retailer in India and with its portfolio of multiple international brand partnerships, Reliance can provide a significant edge with real estate and operational synergies, said Devangshu Dutta, founder of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight.
Live Events
""India is an obvious growth market choice for large brands and retailers such as Primark,"" he said. ""In the end, though, it will come down to how effective the merchandise and the marketing is in connecting with the diverse needs of Indian consumers across the country.""
Primark is owned by London-listed
Associated British Foods
and has over 400 stores globally with a stated ambition to expand across new and existing markets to reach 530 outlets by the end of 2026. In the lower-priced segment, Reliance has Trends and recently launched fashion and lifestyle store Yousta, which competes directly with fast-fashion brands Zara and H&M in India. Reliance currently has over 18,774 stores-these include supermarkets as well as electronics, jewellery and apparel outlets. It has also either partnered with or acquired over 80 global brands for local sales.
Reliance didn't respond to queries. A
Primark
spokesperson said, ""As a growing international business, we're always open to new opportunities. However, we don't comment on speculation about where we might expand to next.''
Experts said India's consumption structure has been skewed in the past over a narrow base of richer consumers accounting for a large chunk of market. However, now the opportunity for value-brands is expanding.

Delhi High Court upholds rejection of Reebok India's conversion to Limited Liability Company,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/delhi-high-court-upholds-rejection-of-reebok-indias-conversion-to-limited-liability-company/articleshow/107858854.cms,20-02-2024,"The
Delhi High Court
has upheld the
Registrar of Companies
’ order that rejected
conversion
of
Reebok India Company
from an “Unlimited Liability Company"" to a ""
Limited Liability Company
"".
Dismissing Reebok India's petition, Justice Subramonium Prasad said that the reasons given by the RoC in rejecting the Reebok’s application on the ground that various prosecutions have been filed by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office against it for offences under the Companies Act and the Indian Penal Code cannot said to be so perverse, especially keeping in mind the interest of shareholders and the interest of creditors.
""The anxiety on the part of the RoC that the creditors and stakeholder should not be left high and dry cannot be said to be completely unjustified,"" Justice Prasad said.
“The registrar was also not provided with an NoC or undertaking from all the shareholders to support the conversion application and the petitioner(Reebok) did not even issue a public advertisement inviting objections from various creditors/stakeholders on the issue of conversion,” the HC said.
The RoC had also observed that Reebok suffered substantial financial losses and had a net deficit in current liabilities over the assets in excess of Rs 2100 crore. The registrar was also not provided with a no-objection certificate or undertaking from all the shareholders to support the application for conversion and Reebok did not even issue a public advertisement inviting objections from various creditors or stakeholders on the issue of conversion, the HC order noted.

It further found that Reebok had a net deficit in current liabilities over the assets amounting to Rs. 2117.52 crore, Rs. 2175.32 crore and Rs 2122.14 crore as on March 31, 2014, March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2019, respectively, due to cash losses incurred by the company during the past financial years and the net worth of the company is negative and if company goes into winding up or is unable to pay its debts/liabilities then only the three shareholders of company have to bring money to pay the debts of the company and the company will not be able to pay its creditors in full.

Walmart
said they have sourced over $30 billion goods from the Indian market for its global operation in the past 25 years. The company is now set to triple the sourcing of these goods from India to $10 billion annually by 2027.
Andrea Albright, executive vice president of sourcing at Walmart, said that through its Walmart Vriddhi initiative, launched in 2019, the company is training Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) ""to learn new capabilities, scale and maximize their business ambitions"" free of charge. At its Growth Summit, the company announced that they have met their target early and have already trained more than 50,000 MSMEs.
Jason Fremstad, Walmart's senior vice president, supplier development and sourcing, said, ""What we are aiming to do this week is to continue finding new suppliers to source in categories- home, apparels, foods, health and wellness, toys... this week is focused on expanding those opportunities and finding new suppliers that we can export in an effort to achieve the goal that we have set out for sourcing $10 billion by the end of 2027.""
The ""people-led tech-powered omni-channel retailer"", with 2.1 million associates globally, states that their strategy is to save people's money and help them live better. The summit was to bring buyers and suppliers together to accelerate exports across the country.
""Our focus is to recruit and train new suppliers to fulfil our purchase orders around the world. These orders often lead to the creation of new jobs. It also allows our suppliers to invest back in their local communities,"" Albright said.

Doug McMillion, CEO of Walmart in a joint video with Walmart international president and CEO, Kathryn McLay, said, ""Other than the US, India is the only market where we have set a sourcing objective. And that is because we see so much opportunity.""
Walmart also aimed to explore potential solutions to supply chain challenges through innovative companies and startups. Albright told ET, ""Some of the challenges could range from circularity- how do we continue to find ways to be more sustainable inside of our product. Other challenges might be- how we might use Gen-AI or AI to continue to forecast better and get better data to our suppliers. So, there's a range of problems that I think the entire industry is trying to solve. And we're trying to find those right entrepreneurs to learn more from and maybe can create some type of partnerships.""

Republic Day week saw modest growth for D2C brands: GoKwik,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/republic-day-week-saw-modest-growth-for-d2c-brands-gokwik/articleshow/107664553.cms,13-02-2024,"Ecommerce enabler
GoKwik
, has reported that the direct to consumer (D2C) brands on its network witnessed 12.72% increase in sales during the
Republic Day
sale week compared to the week prior. The GMV or Gross Merchandise Volume also saw a nominal rise of 10%.
The growth in the first quarter of FY 2024 has been muted after a great performance in the last quarter of 2023, despite Republic Day, which is usually a marquee sales event at the start of the year to give the necessary boost to brands.
“With shoppers going all out in the long festive season sale period in 2023, followed by the
Black Friday sale
that has increasingly grown popular amongst Indians, a modest surge in the Republic Day sale period could be a natural resting period in the first month of 2024. Moreover, with macro headwinds such as high-interest rates, layoffs, etc, shoppers might have been more conservative in their spending this time around. However, this seems to be a temporary trend and the consumption is likely to pick up with D2C’s favourite Valentine’s Day sale period coming up,” said Chirag Taneja, Co-Founder and CEO, GoKwik.
Traditionally sale periods last year were dominated by the fashion category. However, this Republic Day sale witnessed a distinctive change, with the beauty & personal care (
BPC
) segment emerging as the top contributor, experiencing a significant 19.89% order surge. Fashion followed closely with a nearly 7% order uplift.
Tier 3 shoppers were the biggest contributors to the orders during this sale period with nearly half of all the orders. Tier 1 and 2 cities accounted for about 25% of orders, respectively. This trend was also observed across categories as most orders were clocked from Tier 3 cities continuing the trend from last year's sale events. However, shoppers from smaller markets being more cost-sensitive than cities, have also availed almost two times more discounts from brands, especially in the BPC category, during the Republic Day sale period.

As observed on GoKwik’s network, D2C brand websites have emerged as the preferred shopping channel for Tier 3 and beyond cities over the last couple of years. Despite slower consumer demand in 2023 barring the positive buying sentiments during the festive season, several brands have witnessed significant growth through their D2C channel. In highly competitive categories such as BPC & Fashion which cater to the mass segment, investing in brand building will help in gaining consumer trust which in turn should help in sustainable growth in the longer term.
Cash remained a preferred mode of payment in smaller towns, accounting for three-fourths of transactions during this period, while Tier 1 and 2 cities saw a higher inclination towards prepaid orders. Even though Tier 1 clocked most prepaid orders at 33%, the majority of India beyond Tier 1 cities still prefers Cash on Delivery (COD) as a payment mode.
Amongst states, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh continued to dominate the sale period orders, just like previous festive season sales, followed by Karnataka, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.
Gift cards and premium memberships emerged as top choices among consumers during this sale period, especially in BPC, underlining the increasing preference for flexible gifting options and exclusive memberships in the online shopping ecosystem.
GoKwik houses over 1200 eCommerce brands in its network including Lenskart, Neemans, Man Matters, Purplle, Shoppers Stop, etc, ranging from fashion, beauty, health and nutrition, electronics and other key categories of the online shopping space.

Amway appoints Rajneesh Chopra as new India chief,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amway-appoints-rajneesh-chopra-as-new-india-chief/articleshow/107559585.cms,09-02-2024,"Direct selling company
Amway India
has appointed
Rajneesh Chopra
as its new India chief executive. Chopra moves from Texas-based direct selling wellness company
Immunotec
, where he was chief commercial officer leading 14 global markets, involved in digital, sales and marketing roles. Chopra takes over from previous
Amway
chief Anshu Budhraja, who exited the company a couple of months back.
Prior to his role at Immunotec, Chopra has been associated with Amway North America and cosmetics company Revlon.
An Amway India spokesperson confirmed the developments to ET.
Amway’s core products in India include Nutrilite nutrition and Artistry cosmetics.
Industry body Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA)’s annual report estimated the direct selling industry at Rs 19,020 crore in financial year ’22, having grown 5.3 per cent year-on-year.
Live Events
Direct selling companies in India sell to consumers through direct-seller members and not through retailers. According to the IDSA, India has 8.9 million direct sellers currently.
Legitimate companies such as Amway, Oriflame and Herbalife which operate as direct sellers have been pushing for tighter regulation and clarity from the government, to differentiate them from fly-by-night multi-level-marketing ponzi companies.
The Ministry of Consumer Affairs had modified the Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules, 2021, through a notification issued last year in June, to distinguish between fraudulent pyramid and money-circulation schemes and legitimate, direct-selling players. But executives representing the IDSA have said further clarity is needed in the definition of a network of sellers.

Multiplier had initiated an investigation by
EY
to look into the concerns. The bench noted that both parties should try to reach a settlement before the next date of a hearing scheduled on February 13.
The counsel for Amazon observed that there was a need for the service provider to get its house in order. Multiplier has initiated criminal proceedings against employees in the fake invoice case.
The bench asked that Multiplier present the report by EY, noting that fake invoices were indeed a matter of concern.
The bench also noted that some amount is payable, but it needs to be determined how much of it is in dispute.
Multiplier had entered into a two-year agreement with Amazon Seller Services Pvt Ltd, another subsidiary of a foreign company, on May 1, 2019, which was executed in January 2020 for two years and was transferred by ASSPL to AWIPL.
AWIPL had filed a reply to the petition on February 6. The bench will hear further arguments next week.

Traders hint at slump in bulk purchases from MSME units before April as new IT law stares them in face,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/traders-hint-at-slump-in-bulk-purchases-from-msme-units-before-april-as-new-it-law-stares-them-in-face/articleshow/107533181.cms,08-02-2024,"Sections of master
distributors
are said to be carefully weighing on their purchases in view of the new
income tax law
that requires them to clear
pending bills
with
MSME units
within 45 days at the most.
The new provision in the IT law will kick in from the
assessment year
2024-25. The default this fiscal year by dealers will invite action later. Rahul Goyal, a
manufacturer-cum-trader
, in Bengaluru, said many distributors have begun scaling down on their purchases just to be on the right side of the law.
“Up until last year, we would buy in bulk from MSMEs towards the end of the fiscal year to stock up on goods. This time, we cannot afford to do so,” Goyal, a member of the Karnataka Hardware & Allied Merchants; Association, said.
K Bhavadasan, MD of KP Namboodiris, a Thrissur-based

""If I don't get the payment within a certain deadline, how can I clear my bills to an
MSME
within 45 days,"" asked Goyal.
""How can a distributor honour his payment commitment to a manufacturer if hundreds of small merchants he has supplied products to don't pay him on time?,"" asked a Kerala-based manufacturer, empathising with his distributors.
Government bodies should set an example for the rest in making payments, said Bhavadasan. “We have sold products worth Rs 5.5 crore to the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (‘Supplyco’) and the bill is still pending,"" he said, adding that he had to downsize his staff to absorb the financial impact.
“If the payment is not made within 45 days, the section 43B (h) would treat the due as part of your business income for the current financial year which would face taxes. Carrying the due forward to next year would make the purchase costlier,"" said Arun Upadhyay, a CA in Bengaluru. ""We will have to see how things are going to play out in the months to come.""
The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has written to the Centre asking for a grace period of six months to adjust to the new system, general secretary Praveen Khandelwal told ET. “Right now, there is a lot of confusion, not just among traders, but also the CAs as to where exactly we fall.”
""If the material has to come from north India, it takes an extra week to come, and thus a trader loses close to 10 days between the billing date and supply. Up to now, many suppliers would understand this problem and would provide some leniency in the payment cycle, but that’s not possible now,” Goyal said.
The Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association wrote to the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, saying that the amendment “was creating a panic among all traders, manufacturers. ” Enforcing it would lead to restriction in sale of goods as traders would no longer be able to buy in bulk.
The Bangalore Wholesale Cloth Merchants Association has written to the minister as well, asking for an extension of 90 days to be able to comply with the law. Trade activist Sajjanraj Mehta called the amendment yet another example of the government “favouring the MSMEs,” without consulting traders.

Physical retail surging: 41 million sq ft new development expected by 2028,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/physical-retail-surging-41-million-sq-ft-new-development-expected-by-2028/articleshow/107483578.cms,07-02-2024,"The

Operational retail developments currently stand at 91 million sq ft across top 7 cities of India and is expected to increase by 45% to reach 132 million sq ft by the end of 2028.

“Encouraged by the increased buoyancy of the Indian economy, leading real estate developers have made significant announcements to launch retail developments in the country. A substantial proportion of the upcoming supply is by institutional players. The operational stock of retail developments which stands at 91 million sq ft is expected to increase by 45% and reach 132 million sq ft by the end of 2028,” said Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head Research & REIS, India, JLL.
According to him, with the launch of India’s first retail-led REIT in 2023, there may be more acquisitions to expand the retail portfolio further. As most global institutional funds have created retail development platforms with key developers, the retail segment is set to get on a faster growth trajectory.
“A total of 16 retail developments with a gross leasable area of 6.2 million sq ft became operational in 2023, up by 125% on-year. Notably, 44% (2.7 million sq ft) of the new supply that became operational in 2023 had the presence of institutional funds,” said Rahul Arora, Head of Office Leasing Advisory and Retail Services, India, JLL.
According to him, the average size of mall developments that got completed in 2023 has increased by 41% from 276,800 sqft in 2022 to 389,900 sq ft. Developers are coming up with bigger malls to offer elevated experience to the shoppers, be it entertainment, food & beverages (F&B), or fashion.
In 2023, 8.7 million sq ft of gross leasing across malls and prominent high streets was recorded in top 7 cities. Bengaluru led the gross leasing with a share of 33%, followed by Delhi NCR with a share of 18% and Mumbai with a share of 17%. Consumer confidence is getting translated into expansion by retailers to increase their store network and sales.
Fashion and apparel had the highest share of 40% in the total leasing volume. Super value and value fashion segments have witnessed robust traction from leading retailers as they are launching their new formats and expanding in this segment. Other categories that contributed majorly were F&B (16%), entertainment (13%), home & furnishing (6%) and daily needs & grocery (5%).
A total of 14 new international brands entered India in 2023, up from 11 and 8 brands in 2022 and 2021 respectively. Majority (8 brands) of the new entrants this year opened their first stores in Mumbai followed by Delhi NCR with F&B segment being the top ranker.

Slowing consumer sales growth marks end of revenge shopping,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/slowing-consumer-sales-growth-marks-end-of-revenge-shopping/articleshow/107472069.cms,07-02-2024,"Discretionary retail sales in India screeched to a halt in 2023, with growth in segments like apparel, footwear, beauty, and quick service restaurants (QSR) halving to just 9% after two years of pandemic-fuelled surge. This reflects weak consumer sentiment though spending on high-ticket items such as automobiles and electronics continued backed by easy loans.
Analysts and industry executives project a prolonged market slump, with a recovery expected only after two to three quarters.
'Slowdown to be slightly prolonged'
According to the
Retailers Association of India
(RAI), in the apparel and footwear segments, the budget-conscious value category was hit the hardest.
With three-fourths of annual sales growth largely driven by network expansion, the organised retail sector's same-store sales growth (
SSG
) of 2-3% last year suggests an ebbing of demand for clothes, shoes, cosmetics and fast food.

Worse, the traditionally busy October to December period, marked by festivals, saw a modest sales growth of 6%, with like-to-like sales declining compared to 2022, according to a report prepared by RAI and exclusively made available to ET.
The report surveyed the top 100 retailers in the country from modern retail spanning segments. SSG indicates customer demand and measures
revenue
from stores that are operational for at least a year.
""Like-for-like growth has been quite muted throughout the year. Most of the brands have expanded to new geographies and whatever the growth we are seeing is due to that. We were expecting things to recover after January but the way things are looking, the slowdown seems slightly prolonged,"" said Devarajan Iyer, chief executive of department store chain
Lifestyle International
.
Most apparel and lifestyle retailers raised prices across categories in 2022, especially after a surge in cotton prices due to higher shipment costs and rupee depreciation.
However, last year saw companies either cut prices or offer steep discounts to clear unsold stocks after the previous year's price increases.
Lacklustre Oct-Dec quarter
""We have seen slowdown across consumer segments but were expecting a retail recovery during October-December quarter which has not happened so far. Unless interest rates are lowered, companies, especially tech firms, give decent salary hikes and there are no further job losses, we do not see a recovery for another 2-3 quarters,"" said Abneesh Roy, executive director at
Nuvama Institutional Equities
.
The pandemic was also marked by booming sales of athleisure wear, followed by apparel and lifestyle products, which bucked the overall sluggish trend due to pent-up demand and consumers upgrading their wardrobes after offices reopened. This momentum has since stabilised.
""Revenge shopping that we saw during the pandemic was never sustainable. While people are buying higher priced products including cars and electronics with finance options, the increasing
EMI
every month is forcing them to cut back on lifestyle products like clothing and accessories,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, chief executive officer of RAI.
While the fashion retail segment struggled with a demand slowdown in 2023 due to inflationary headwinds, the value category remained more impacted compared to premium products and is yet to attain its pre-pandemic level average sales per square feet, RAI said in the report.
Within segments, apparel and clothing grew at the slowest pace of 8% though QSR expanded 13% in 2023. Sales of furniture, sporting goods and jewellery rose 12% while beauty, electronics and food and grocery grew 11% each.
Premiumisation trend strong
Meanwhile, Shoppers Stop, during a recent investors' call, said the retail chain has seen a recovery post Christmas, but it is still inconsistent and that the market remains muted despite green shoots.
""The entire non-apparel piece, whether it's beauty or non-apparel, is doing really well. We also foresee that going forward, the premium brands and the premiumisation journey will keep on becoming stronger and stronger. For us, those are the reasons why the revival in demand will happen,"" said Kavindra Mishra, chief executive of Shoppers Stop, which reported a 9% sales increase in the December quarter.
Others like
Metro Brands
posted a 6% revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter, while Bata India's revenue remained almost flat. McDonald's India franchisee
Westlife Foodworld
saw sales fall 2% with SSG declining 9%.
Rival
Restaurant Brands Asia
that runs
Burger King
posted a 20% increase in revenue but SSG slowed sharply to 2.6% from 28% in the year-ago quarter.
""On the macro side, demand conditions remained tough with lower levels of eating out frequency. The festive season saw a slight uptick, but the demand pressure continued thereafter. The softness in general consumption trends is quite visible across the retail space and several other macro indicators,"" Akshay Jatia, executive director at Westlife Foodworld told investors recently.

"Domestic toy makers’ tie ups with Snapdeal, Walmart in pipeline: Govt",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/domestic-toy-makers-tie-ups-with-snapdeal-walmart-in-pipeline-govt/articleshow/107437254.cms,05-02-2024,"The government Monday said that tie ups between
domestic toy makers
and “internationally acclaimed big players” including
Snapdeal
and
Walmart
are in the pipeline and that the sector is poised for success in the future.
The statement comes amid Indian
toy makers
receiving orders above $10 million at a five-day
international toy fair
in
Germany
.
“While the domestic manufacturers have already experienced success in Germany, tie-ups with internationally acclaimed big players including Snapdeal and Walmart is in the pipeline,” the
commerce and industry ministry
said in a statement.
The exporters said buyers from countries such as the US, the UK, South Africa, and Germany showed interest in their products and placed a good number of orders at the Nuremberg fair held from January 30-February 3. There were more than 55 participants from India.
“The Indian toy sector is growing at a healthy rate and competing with global players. Among the most popular categories at the fair were those pertaining to wooden toys and educational learning toys,” the ministry said.
Live Events
Initiatives by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade like mandatory quality norms, increase in custom duty and a National Action Plan on Toys helped in the manufacture of high-quality products that received appreciation at the international platform, according to the statement.
The domestic manufacturers at the fair said a considerable shift in the buyers’ approach and behaviour has been witnessed.
“India is now being recognised as a lucrative alternative sourcing destination,”
the ministry said, adding that the show has opened the doors for international joint ventures.
India’s toy exports jumped to $325.72 million in 2022-23 from $96.17 million in 2014-15. Imports, on the other hand, declined 52% to $158.7 million in 2022-23 from $332.55 million in 2014-15.

furniture retailer
IKEA is looking at the next round of investment in India after exhausting its commitment of Rs 10,500 crore when it entered the country 10 years back, according to the company's India CEO Susanne Pulverer. The company, which kicked off its
retail
operations in India with the opening of its first store in Hyderabad in August 2018, is currently setting up projects in Delhi-NCR that are expected to open in 2025 and will complete its committed investment for 10 years.
""This first investment that we committed is booked with the projects in NCR. So with that, we have exhausted the Rs 10,500 crore and we are looking at the next level of investment to further build
IKEA
presence in India, to expand volumes and increase sourcing. So that is in the plan making and we will announce more when we are ready. The plans are being formulated, and we will make announcements when ready,"" Pulverer told PTI.
In 2013, the government approved a Rs 10,500 crore FDI proposal by Ikea to set up 10 stores with allied infrastructure in 10 years. Subsequently, it had plans to open 15 more stores.
At present, 100 per cent foreign direct investment is permitted in single-brand retail trading through automatic route.
Currently, Ikea is operating stores in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bengaluru and is investing around Rs 7,000 crore to enter the National Capital Region with two stores in Gurugram and Noida.

When asked as to whether the next tranche of investment would be on a similar scale or potentially higher, Pulverer said a decision regarding this would be taken by its parent company Ingka Group.
However, she also added would the next round to be ""big and bold"" looking at the growth potential of India.
There is ""a lot of belief in India as it is coming into its growth decade. As a market, it is very dynamic. Many young people are upgrading their lives and are investing in their homes. So it is a huge opportunity market for Ikea,"" Pulverer added.
As part of the strategy, Ikea is focusing on markets of the South and West region with its omnichannel approach.
However, with its upcoming stores in Delhi NCR, it is mulling expanding to other cities such as Lucknow and Chandigarh in North India, which also offer good opportunities. Though she added premature to disclose any plans beyond the Delhi NCR at this point
""Beyond the NCR (National Capital Region), Pune and Chennai are of interest. Kolkata is also on our radar, but it will be a stepwise approach,"" she added.
Besides, Ikea is also working to increase sourcing from the Indian markets for its global retail operations. It offers the potential to diversify in sectors such as furniture.
""While India has the potential to further develop its production capacities, the current export of furniture from India remains relatively small. Exploring opportunities for regionalised and global sourcing from India is part of IKEA's ongoing strategy,"" she added.
While, for its domestic operation in India, Ikea is sourcing around 33 per cent of retailed products here as per the regulations and has even plans to increase it further.
""Our intention is to continue increasing this percentage, as it makes sense to produce more locally and explore India's potential to supply other IKEA markets. Growing volumes in the country, with more stores and online markets, will facilitate the next level of local sourcing,"" she added.
It is essential for sustainability and affordability for Indian consumers, she said adding that there is a need to focus on specific categories.
""Textiles, plastics, metals, stainless steel, mixed materials, handicrafts, bulky furniture like mattresses and sofas, and local production of wood-based furniture are areas where we see the potential for growth,"" Pulverer added.
Foreign retailers with more than 51 per cent FDI in this sector have to source a minimum of 30 per cent of the value of purchased goods domestically, preferably from MSME, village and cottage industries, artisans and craftsmen, in all sectors.
Presently Ikea is getting one-fourth of its sales in India from online platforms from its own channels such as its app, and e-commerce portal. It also introduced Shop By Phone assistance service and increased doorstep delivery facility in 62 new markets in India.
According to RoC filings,
Ikea India
sales were up 61 per cent to Rs 1,768 crore for the financial year which ended on March 31, 2023. However, its loss was at Rs 1,134 crore, on account of expansion in new markets and investments in infrastructure.

The nature of Ikea business is such that customers seek touch-and-feel products, which necessitate physical meeting places and stores.
""However, the convenience offered by online channels is expected to continue growing, especially considering people's busy lives and the challenges of traffic,"" the Ikea India CEO said.
Online sales will grow but it will never surpass those from the physical channels, and there will be a mix, she said.
""Some years back, before we came to India, we were debating between 20 per cent and 10 per cent. I am confident that it will be a higher share of the total sales. As we move forward, gradually, it will increase and we will see strong growth in the online segment,"" she said.
In the markets where Ikea has the highest share, online share is around 30 plus per cent, according to Pulverer.
""It is at the same level as any other market where we are present in the world,"" she added.

India plays key role in growing Mango's global business: Exec,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-plays-key-role-in-growing-mangos-global-business-exec/articleshow/107240883.cms,30-01-2024,"Spanish fashion brand
Mango
said
India
is a crucial market for its
global growth
due to surging demand for
women's western wear
,
retail infrastructure
built over the past decade and
online adoption
in India.
""India is one of the 10-15 markets that matter the most today in the strategy of Mango for the growth of the company. The country has grown appetite, especially in the women's wear in the western segment. The country has given itself much better infrastructure, on retail,"" Daniel Lopez,
chief expansion
and
franchise officer
at Mango, told ET. ""India is a very online connected country and this has led the country worldwide in terms of online intelligence.""
Mango has 110 stores in India via its partner Myntra. The apparel brand had first entered the country nearly two decades ago with Major Brands and had later tied up with
DLF
for its expansion. However, it partnered with
Myntra
in 2014 for its online platform, which in 2017 was extended for opening physical stores as well. Globally, the retailer plans to open 500 new stores by 2026 in key markets, including the US, the UK and India, as part of a three-year strategic plan. Mango said it will take the store count in India to 120 even as it saw a 50% increase in online demand last calendar year.
""In Spain, with 45 million inhabitants, we have 350 stores and in France, with 70-80 million inhabitants, we have very close to 250. So, I think that the journey has just started in India and the roots are very solid, but we still have a lot to do ahead of us,"" added Lopez.

The retailer said it does not want to change its price-tag to mop up higher volumes at the cost of diluting its global positioning of strong focus on quality and in-house design. Despite higher pricing, Myntra, which sells its entire global range in India, said Mango has been its largest selling global brand in women's western wear for the past two years.
""Mango is one of the preferred brands for the metros and is growing with our non-metro shoppers aspiring to get their hands on the latest in global fashion. The brand drops fresh styles every month and endeavours to ensure latest trends are accessible,"" said Sharon Pais, chief business officer, Myntra.

"Ikea's India sales rise 61% in FY23, but losses widen to over ₹1,134 cr",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ikeas-india-sales-rise-61-in-fy23-but-losses-widen-to-over-1134-cr/articleshow/107240845.cms,30-01-2024,"Ikea
has incurred a net loss of more than ₹3 crore every day on average in
India
in the last financial year reflecting the large-scale investments by the world's largest furniture retailer to solidify its footprint in one of its key global markets.
The company's sales in India surged 61% to ₹1,768 crore in FY23 helped by the opening of new brick-and-mortar stores and the expansion of its online presence.
Net losses at the Swedish retailer widened to more than ₹1,134 crore during the year due to investments towards creating new infrastructure such as land and distribution centres for its upcoming stores. In FY22, Ikea recorded a net loss of ₹902.8 crore on net sales of ₹1,076.1 crore.
The retailer, known for its ready-to-assemble products, said it is continuing to work on its plans towards positioning, growth, and profitability of Ikea's omnichannel business in India and also opened smaller stores during the year, according to its latest filing with the Registrar of Companies.
Ikea said its expansion plans and operations in India were impacted in FY23 due to the pandemic. However, the company not only managed its operations in an effective way and the management is optimistic about its prospects in the country. Ikea runs five stores in India including large format stores in
Mumbai
,
Hyderabad
and Bengaluru, and online presence in six markets.
Live Events
The company had in 2013 received the Indian government's approval to invest ₹10,500 crore to open big-box stores. The retailer, which had earlier announced plans to open 25 stores in India, has rejigged it with a new ambition to serve 200 million people by 2025 and open a lot more stores, including smaller ones.
About three-fourths of the Indian furniture industry is unorganised, although about half a dozen ecommerce firms, including
Flipkart
and Amazon, have entered the market in the past few years.

Desi versus videshi retail: Global brands are making more space for themselves,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/desi-versus-videshi-retail-global-brands-are-making-more-space-for-themselves/articleshow/107229039.cms,29-01-2024,"High aspirational value, rising disposable incomes in non-metro markets,
premiumisation
, and social media boosting brand awareness have led to international retail brands growing at a fast pace while desi brands go easy on expansion.
Global brands such as
Zara
, H&M, Bugatti Fashion, La Vie en Rose,
Adidas
,
Nike
, West Elm,
Starbucks
, Uniqlo and Marks & Spencer are fast finding favour with Indian buyers. A significant propeller of their growth is small towns where buyers, willing to spend more, are getting more brand conscious.

Global biggies Zara, H&M and Adidas bet big on tier-2 cities to drive growth
According to CBRE, about two dozen international brands entered India in 2023 and expansion by global brands that are already present in the country have fuelled the demand.
Videshi retailers make more space
Live Events
The retail sector recorded an all-time high leasing in 2023, taking 7.1 million sq ft across eight cities, an increase of 47% from last year despite large retailers slowing down on store expansion. A prominent factor in the growth was international brands. Retail leasing by international brands was almost 25% in 2023 compared to 14% in the previous year, ET has reported.
Canadian lingerie retailer La Vie en Rose made its debut in India in partnership with Apparel Group India and launched its first store in Delhi-NCR in July 2023 and later expanded in Pune and Bangalore. Similarly, Rimowa, a German luxury luggage brand, entered India through its partnership with Reliance Brands and opened its first store in Mumbai.
Other notable expansions by international players include French fashion & apparel brand Bugatti Fashion and the American furniture brand West Elm opening their stores in Pune, and American lingerie brand Victoria's Secret opening stores in Hyderabad and Pune.
Making inroads into small towns
Three dozen big brands entered tier-II cities in the first nine months of 2023, as demand from smaller cities continued to be strong even after the pandemic. A good number of those were global brands.
Brands such as H&M, Marks & Spencer and GAP have entered cities like Indore, Mangalore, Patna, Ranchi, Mysore, and Coimbatore, according to data by CBRE,
“India’s first retail REIT has encouraged developers to aggregate and upgrade their existing facilities, apart from developing new malls. Moreover, domestic and international fashion brands are looking to expand in non-metro cities, fueled by a well-aware and well-travelled consumer set,” Ram Chandnani, Managing Director, Advisory & Transactions Services, CBRE India, has said.
Desi retailers turn cautious
While international brands are expanding at a strong pace, desi retailers are turning cautious. India's top retailers have significantly slowed down their store expansion this fiscal year, after opening a record number of outlets last year, ET has reported based on their latest investor disclosures. The top five retail chains - Reliance Retail, Titan Company, Avenue Supermarts that owns DMart, V-Mart Retail and Shoppers Stop - together opened 44% fewer stores in the first three quarters through December compared with a year earlier.
Top industry executives attributed the slowdown in store expansion to more focus on profitability when consumption had not picked up the way it was expected to and as most of the new markets are already filled up with two-four retailers, leaving little room for more outlets. It appears global retail brands are less vulnerable to these pressures.
Global brands buck the trend
Top global apparel and fast fashion brands appear to have struck a strong chord with young customers, racking up sales growth of anywhere between 40% and 60% in FY23, bucking the trend in a market where the overall demand for discretionary products slowed down, ET has reported based on latest filings with the Registrar of Companies.
For instance, Swedish fashion retailer H&M and rival Zara reported a 40% increase in its topline while Japanese brand Uniqlo saw a 60% jump in sales. American denim maker Levi Strauss and British brand Marks & Spencer posted a 54% increase. Dubai-based department store Lifestyle International, too, saw a 46% jump in revenues on a large base. These brands garnered combined annual revenues of nearly $2.6 billion, more than double compared to FY21 when it was $1.1 billion all put together.
""With consumers getting brand conscious, global brands have a natural advantage. There is a distinct aspirational momentum for international brands that carries them through. Also they can sustain having unsold inventory and discounting better than smaller peers,"" Devangshu Dutta, founder of Third Eyesight, a strategy consulting firm, told ET recently. ""Also, these brands have not yet reached saturation point in terms of network and hence can invest further to widen their reach.""
Even as international brands are aggressively adding more physical stores, the revenue surge was also led by brands' shifting focus on ecommerce, which now accounts for more than a quarter of their sales, even as they face intensify competition from both local and global rivals in an increasingly crowded market where web-commerce firms continue to offer steep discounts. Over the past two years, sales growth for most retailers have been price-led, reversing the historic trend when volumes or actual demand drove a bulk of the sales.
The fashion retail segment has been struggling with a demand slowdown since January last year due to inflationary headwinds. The overall retail growth slowed down to 6% in both March and April, increasing marginally to 9% in August and September before falling slightly to 7% in October and November, according to the Retailers Association of India.

Nike
,
Starbucks
,
Uniqlo
, and Marks & Spencer, along with local brands, are capitalizing on market potential in cities like Jaipur, Chandigarh, Patna, Lucknow, Kochi, Goa, and

. As of September 2023, Jaipur, Lucknow, and
Chandigarh
individually had retail stock ranging between 3-7 million square feet.
This trend reflects the shift toward untapped markets and the recognition of tier-2 cities' rising economic significance.

CaratLane
, owned by the
Tata Group
, is placing significant emphasis on tier-2 markets, having expanded its store presence in locations such as Lucknow and Indore by two-fold in the past year.
“To give a sense, CaratLane started FY23 with 22 stores in tier-2 cities and now has 39 stores in these cities. There are a host of other smaller towns like Kochi, Guwahati, Ludhiana, and Mysore where we have seen strong demand and have increased our store footprint in the last one year,” chief operating officer Atul Sinha told TOI.
The emergence and increased adoption of e-commerce has affected the retail landscape of smaller cities. A surge in digital usage in these regions during the Covid-19 pandemic has enabled consumers to discover and experiment with new brands. Retailers are looking to tap into opportunities created thanks to these trends. Approximately 50 per cent of urban India’s online shoppers hailed from tier-2 and 3 cities, which is expected to rise up to 60 per cent by 2030.
“These e-commerce dynamics point towards the presence of a high aspiration consumer base, thereby propelling the influx of quality retail supply,” analysts at CBRE added.
Manyavar has recently inaugurated a 17,000-square-foot store in Ranchi, with plans to unveil another 20,000 square feet store in Gorakhpur. This shows the increasing interest of retailers in smaller cities.
“Tier-2 and -3 markets are becoming what we call mini metros. As more and more small medium businesses grow in these markets, that gives a lot of opportunities for people to grow in the corporate ladder, giving them higher levels of income, and leading to higher discretionary spending,” said chief revenue officer Vedant Modi, Manyavar.
Modi said that around 40-50 per cent of the company’s business today comes from tier-2 and 3 cities.

Republic Day
weekend to offer deep discounts and enticing financing options, fuelling a 25% sales surge, amplifying their efforts to clear inventory. The
mid-premium segment
was the biggest beneficiary, even as overall sales grew at a slightly faster pace than even last Diwali.
Packaged food, staples, laptops, wearables and smartphones saw the highest growth rates, mainly due to new products, according to senior industry executives.
The average billing value jumped by 10-15% over last year, with smaller towns outpacing urban markets. The executives cited above said there has also been an increase in sales of mass segment products, but added that they would like to see a sustained period of steady sales growth to conclude it as a definitive sign of consumption recovery.

senior category head B Krishna Rao said national as well as local food and grocery retailers have been offering additional discounts on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) from their own pockets - and offers such as buy one-get one free on some products - to push sales, which were depressed last quarter.
""There is a massive surge in footfall and we have been rushing truckloads of stock in the last couple of days to large chains across the country. It's the same story for all FMCG companies,"" said Rao.

"Retailers forced to write-off inventory due to obsolescence, cut sourcing periods",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-forced-to-write-off-inventory-due-to-obsolescence-cut-sourcing-periods/articleshow/107149512.cms,26-01-2024,"Apparel retailers have started to write-off
unsold inventory
due to
product obsolescence
, sourcing closer to the season and have reduced their sourcing period of merchandise from 120-150 days earlier to 60-90 days to reduce such risks of obsolescence with demand yet to pick up.
The companies said such write-offs are required despite them trying to clear unsold and old inventory with deep discounting for an extended period as a lot of old merchandise is still not sold. Such measures are also going to have an impact on the margins this fiscal, executives said.
Shoppers Stop Ltd
chief executive Kavindra Mishra told analysts last week that while ordering the spring summer and autumn winter merchandise (for last year), the company didn't anticipate the slowness as is there right now.
“We decided to clean up and provide for the obsolescence of inventory which is worth around close to Rs 9 crore. Due to this, our gross margins are impacted by 60 bps (basis points),” he said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
Departmental store chain Lifestyle International chief executive Devaranjan Iyer said several retailers are forced to write-off inventory due to obsolescence and have cut
sourcing periods
to reduce such risks in the future. The company is now placing orders for 2-3 months as compared to 6-7 months earlier.
Live Events
“This will give us the ability to find the shock and then react in a much more agile manner,” said Iyer. “It will also ensure inventory is not stuck for six months and the demand forecast is on a real time basis. Obsolescence has increased for the industry and this will lead to
margin erosion
for sure,"" he said.
Apparel retail business has been impacted for more than five quarters now and the industry was not at all prepared for the sudden
demand slump
after the festive season in 2022. For three quarters before that, there was a huge surge in demand led by consumers refreshing their wardrobes after the pandemic as restrictions and offices had opened. Hence, all retailers had placed orders for a bullish 2023 leading to stock pile up.
Rural and small town focused V-Mart Retail managing director Lalit Agarwal said the company earlier used to plan for 3-4 months, but now due to the stress in the market it has decided that 20% of the inventory should be planned for 45 days. “This will allow us to adjust in case of stress in the market and be in line with the
fast fashion trend
,” he said. Shoppers Stop too is now buying closer to the season.
Apparel retailers have run extended discounting periods in 2023 and will continue it for the current
end of season sale
, apart from additional discounts offered in ecommerce marketplaces and the upcoming Republic Day sales this weekend.
Retail sales in December showed a growth of 4% as compared to the same period in 2022, according to a just released survey by industry body Retailers Association of India (RAI). Despite the festive season, October and November had also shown growth of 7%.
“While the industry showed growth of about 4 % pan-India, it was due to new stores and new geographies of trading. For most offline retailers, like for like stores growth was negative by about 5 %,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO at RAI.
Retailers have said there is a shift in the consumer spend with people spending more for the travel or experiences rather than only buying products leading to a slowdown in sales.

"December 2023 retail sales in India grow by 4%, marking a slow quarter despite festive season",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/december-2023-retail-sales-in-india-grow-by-4-marking-a-slow-quarter-despite-festive-season/articleshow/107136791.cms,25-01-2024,"Retail sales
in
December
2023 showed a growth of mere 4% as compared to the sales levels during the same period in 2022, according to the survey by
Retailers Association of India
(RAI).
Despite the festive season,
October
and November also showed growth of 7% only, making the October -December quarter a slow one for retailers.
“As we analyze the retail sector’s performance in December 2023, growth has been muted for many retailers despite starting discounts midmonth. It was also the month of marriage season. Retailers who sold categories with high value and consumer financing did see business growth,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI).
Retail businesses across regions have indicated growth in sales as compared to December 2022 sales level with South India signaling a growth of 7%, while North and West India indicated a growth of 3% each followed by East India with only a 2% growth.
“Consumers seem to have chosen to buy high value items like cars, houses, high end electronics on EMI basis, while other discretionary spends have been curtailed by them. While the industry showed growth of about 4 % Pan India, it was thanks to new stores and new geographies of trading. For most off-line retailers, like for like stores growth was negative about 5 %,” said Rajagopalan.

Addition of global brands is unlocking value for Myntra: Nandita Sinha,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/addition-of-global-brands-is-unlocking-value-for-myntra-nandita-sinha/articleshow/107123617.cms,24-01-2024,"Mumbai: Online
fashion
retailer
Myntra
said it has added more than one new international apparel, beauty and lifestyle brand every week on an average since the pandemic, which helped it avoid a slowdown in the overall
retail market
since over a year. With 420
global brands
in its portfolio, the
Flipkart
arm gets about a quarter of its
revenue
from
international brands
. Two years ago, it had 280 international labels.
""The scale at which we provide access to brands allows us to unlock value at scale,"" said Nandita Sinha, chief executive officer of Myntra. ""It's not about the discounting, but when you are able to operate a brand at this scale in the country, the attempt is always to get the right fashion at the right price.""
She said small towns now account for nearly 45% of Myntra's sales, driven by high demand for
premium
and international brands, in a sharp contradiction to the rural slowdown even in basic staples and groceries segment. ""The ability to get exposed to international trends post pandemic is much higher than what it was five years back,"" Sinha said. With 75 million new app users in 2023, Myntra posted record
customer growth
even as the overall fashion retail segment has been struggling with a demand slowdown since January last year due to inflationary headwinds.
ET Bureau
The overall retail growth slowed to 6% in both March and April, increasing marginally to 9% in August and September before falling slightly to 7% in October and November, according to the Retailers Association of
India
. Myntra, however, said it outperformed the market. During FY23, the online retailer's revenue rose 25% to Rs 4,375 crore from Rs 3,501 crore in the previous year.

""We have six million customers who come to us 30 times in a month. We are like Instagram for them,"" Sinha said. ""Now, if they are coming this frequently, how do you cater to their fashion needs?... How do you build excitement for them? How do you cater to all of the occasions that are important for them? And I think we have stuck to that way of thinking,"" she added.
India has attracted a clutch of the world's largest apparel brands including Gap and Uniqlo over the past few years.
Top global apparel and fashion brands such as Zara, H&M, Levi's and Uniqlo have struck a strong chord with young Indian customers, racking up sales growth in 40-60% band in FY23, bucking market trend where demand for discretionary products slowed down. Sinha said India continues to be one of the largest economies, growing with a large young digital and affluent population.
""If you go across the world, there is always a capping of the growth. In India, we are not anywhere near the cap, so I think we are not going to grow at a nominal rate of GDP like that. Our GDP is growing much faster than the rest of the world,"" she said. ""Also, the opportunity for expansion in the way the customer set is growing and affluence is growing is what is really exciting,"" Sinha added.

It is likely that the

for FY25 the finance minister will present on February 1 will leave big announcements for the full budget that will follow after the Lok Sabha elections. The government is likely to stay on the fiscal course-correction glide path in the interim budget, shunning populist spending or incentives ahead of the summer general election, ET has reported based on information from people aware of the matter.
However, the government might have to heed to the message emanating from the retail industry: the slowing consumption.

Retailers in a fix as discounts fail to draw buyers
India's
top retailers have significantly slowed down their store expansion
this fiscal year, after opening a record number of outlets last year, ET has reported based on their latest investor disclosures. The top five retail chains - Reliance Retail, Titan Company, Avenue Supermarts that owns DMart, V-Mart Retail and Shoppers Stop - together opened 44% fewer stores in the first three quarters through December compared with a year earlier.
The chief reason, as per top industry executives, sharper focus on profitability when consumption did not pick up the way it was expected. ""The rural and mass segment has improved year-on-year, but we are yet to return to the original consumption levels,"" V-Mart managing director Lalit Agarwal told ET.
Retailing in India is one of the pillars of India's economy and accounts for about 10 percent of its GDP. The Indian retail market is estimated to be worth $1 trillion and is expected to reach $2 trillion by 2032. India is one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world.
The tell-tale signs

Sunny summer sales forecast, hopes of heavy poll-time spending drive consumer companies to go big on production
Though the well-off continue their shopping spree, there is stress in the mass consumption segment. It had become manifest in the festival and wedding seasons. Persistent inflation subdued wedding celebrations in India’s rural and semi-urban markets, particularly the large Hindi heartland, with demand faltering for customary wedding items such as gold jewellery and household appliances. Inflationary pressures have been disrupting household budgets, leading to a noticeable strain on the purchasing power of people with low- to mid-level incomes.
Overall consumption in small towns and rural areas has been affected for the past six to eight quarters, ET had reported last month, though the well-off in these markets are continuing to make purchases, that too of premium products.
Retail sales in October and November 2023 showed a growth of mere 7% as compared to the sales levels during the same period in 2022 despite the festive season, according to a survey by Retailers Association of India.
Sales are also not drawing in as many customers as expected. Demand for lifestyle products and apparel has remained weak despite retailers offering discounts of as much as 65% during their ongoing end of season sales (EOSS). Most brands also advanced their EOSS by two weeks to early December compared to January, hoping to mop up sales before ecommerce platforms begin their Republic Day sales. The fashion retail segment has been struggling with a demand slowdown since January 2023 due to inflationary headwinds. Overall retail growth slowed to 6% in both March and April, increasing marginally to 9% in August and September before slowing to a 7% increase in October and November, according to the Retailers Association of India.

Budget 2024: India’s resolve on fiscal prudence may counter tricky temptations
The FMCG sector, which has 34% of its market in rural areas, which is a good indicator of rural economic health, has been facing challenges in rural areas due to sluggish demand. The deficiency in rainfall in key agricultural states has disrupted the revival of rural demand seen in the first two quarters of the financial year. President of All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation, Dhairyashil Patil, has told TOI that FMCG sales in rural areas are 20-30% lower than usual. ""High rural unemployment, along with demand for the NREGS jobs, reflects rural stress. El Nino derailed the initial green shoots seen at the start of FY24. Increased aggression of smaller players and alternative avenues of spending such as higher spends on education, medical, telecom charges, are leading to softer growth in the FMCG sector,"" Abneesh Roy, executive director at Nuvama Institutional Equities, has said.
How can the budget fix the problem?
Retailers Association of India has recommended to the Central government that the budget should focus on generating demand and spurring consumption by offering benefits or concessions in the form of lower taxes. The association said that it will boost the overall consumer sentiment and benefit the retail sector. Tax benefits and relief to individual taxpayers will increase the monthly disposable income and support consumption.
Aasif Malbari, CFO, Godrej Consumer, has told ET Now that the budget must try to boost consumption. ""In terms of the overall expectation from the Budget, there has been a lot of boost to the investment side of the economy through various schemes, Make in India, through the PLI schemes, etc. It is important that the Budget focuses on the consumption side also and gives a boost to it, to make it more resilient and an inclusive growth story over the next couple of years. Specifically on the rural end, it is important that the Budget looks at rural job creation so that the consumption economy gets a much required fillip,"" he said.
While the government might cut taxes or launch schemes that put cash in the hand of consumers at the lower end, it can also raise funding for the existing such schemes. Depending on the government's fiscal space, a cut in the excise duty on petrol and diesel will certainly provide a fillip to consumption in the economy and will also help control inflation.
Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist, CareEdge, explains why a fuel cut is an effective tool to boost consumption: ""The demand for petrol/ diesel is quite inelastic, hence any reduction in fuel tax will increase the disposable income in the hands of people, which in turn will help boost consumption of other items. Fuel tax is supposed to be regressive in nature as it broadly impacts all income categories. In India, while a large section of the households may not own private vehicles, they are reliant on public transport and hence they do get indirectly impacted by high fuel prices.""
Besides the government's fiscal and electoral considerations, the stark ground reality of depressed consumption might find a place in the interim budget math. Experts have said the government might not leave the problem to the full budget.

Other notable expansions by international players include French fashion & apparel brand Bugatti Fashion and the American furniture brand West Elm opening their stores in Pune, and American lingerie brand Victoria's Secret opening stores in Hyderabad and Pune.
“The luxury sector, which saw a 162% increase in 2023, shows a promising trend with the entry and expansion of international brands. This positive momentum is expected to continue, aligning with our anticipation for a similar trend in the years ahead,” said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman & CEO, India, Southeast Asia, Middle East & Africa, CBRE.
India has emerged as one of the most promising consumer markets, indicating heightened retailers’ interest in new setup, expansion and upgradation of stores.
Demand for retail spaces in recently completed malls played a significant role in shaping the overall retail space occupancy during the year, and nearly 30% share in total absorption was led by primary leasing in these malls.
“As retail leasing in major tier II cities of India (Chandigarh, Lucknow, Jaipur, Indore and Kochi) surges to 1.2 million sq. ft. in 2023, we witness a transformative shift led by sectors such as fashion & apparel, homeware, entertainment, and hypermarkets, commanding over 70% of leasing activity. The increased demand for organized retail spaces has attracted leading developers and institutional players to these markets, evolving retail formats from vanilla stores to shopping malls, department stores, hypermarkets, and dedicated entertainment zones,” said Ram Chandnani , Managing Director, Advisory & Transaction Services, CBRE India.
Additionally, the total retail supply also reached a historic peak at 6 million sq ft in 2023, over 316% Y-o-Y increase. This rise in supply can be attributed to the commencement of operations of 12 investment-grade malls located in Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Delhi-NCR and Chennai.
The retail leasing in 2023 was predominantly steered by fashion & apparel, with a 32% share in total leasing. This was largely influenced by mid-range fashion value and athleisure brands.
Homeware and department stores accounted for a 17% share, followed by food & beverage with a share of 12%, luxury at a 9% share, and consumer electronics at 6% share in overall leasing during 2023.
The anticipation of increased mall supply and favourable consumer spending patterns is expected to encourage expansion among both international and domestic retailers in the future.

Retailers go easy on expansion as slowing consumption bites,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-go-easy-on-expansion-as-slowing-consumption-bites/articleshow/107092663.cms,24-01-2024,"Kolkata: India's top
retailers
have significantly slowed down their store expansion this fiscal year, after opening a record number of outlets last year, their latest investor disclosures show. The top five retail chains -
Reliance Retail
,
Titan Company
,
Avenue Supermarts
that owns
DMart
,
V-Mart Retail
and
Shoppers Stop
- together opened 44% fewer stores in the first three quarters through December compared with a year earlier.
Reliance Retail opened 1,276 new stores between April and December compared with 2,376 in the same period last year. Tata-owned
Titan
Company opened 239 outlets across brands including the Tanishq jewellery stores, down from 359 stores, while Avenue Supermarts opened 17 new DMart stores against 22 a year earlier.
V-Mart and Shoppers Stop opened more new stores than in the first nine months of last fiscal year. While the number for V-Mart was 46 against 42, its net store addition - after accounting for the poor-performing outlets that it closed - fell to 31 from 34. Shoppers Stop's net count isn't available as it has not reported the number of stores it shut. The retailer also operates in the bridge-to-luxury and premium segment, which is least impacted by changes to consumption patterns.
Top industry executives attributed the slowdown in store expansion to more focus on profitability when consumption had not picked up the way it was expected to and as most of the new markets are already filled up with 2-4 retailers, leaving little room for more outlets.

V-Mart managing director Lalit Agarwal told ET that till last fiscal year, a lot of virgin markets were still left to be untapped, but that opportunity has reduced now due to most retailers expanding in a big way. ""There is also a mindset change in the expansion strategy where the focus is now on profitability since overall consumption has not picked up. The rural and mass segment has improved year-on-year, but we are yet to return to the original consumption levels,"" he said. ""Hence, expansion has become muted for the industry this fiscal.""
Also, last fiscal year's expansion had some pent-up impact since store additions during the peak of Covid (FY21 and FY22) had slowed down due to restrictions in offline store operating hours. Jefferies in a report last week said Reliance Retail had slowed down retail business capex and it will remain moderate, ""as peak investments in supply chain and digital infrastructure (that) are behind and pace of store adds, have come off"". The net store addition for Reliance Retail at 124 last quarter was the lowest in five years (excluding the Covid-hit quarters).

From gold jewellery to smartphones: Consumer appetite for premium products drives sales resurgence,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/from-gold-jewellery-to-smartphones-consumer-appetite-for-premium-products-drives-sales-resurgence/articleshow/107021367.cms,21-01-2024,"Kolkata: Consumer indulgence in premiumisation helped several product categories from branded
gold jewellery
to
smartphones
to televisions to improve sales in the December quarter after struggling in most of 2023, latest earnings report of companies and market researchers' data show.
In electronics, smartphone sales bounced back after five quarters of decline, driven by high sales of premium models such as
Apple iPhones
and Samsung Galaxy S23 series, and demand for large screens during the cricket world cup helped TV sales volume grow by 8-9% on year - up from 2% growth during January to September - last quarter, industry executives said.
While overall gold demand has been muted due to record high prices that rose 15% in 2023 as per the
World Gold Council
, two of the largest retailers in this segment - Reliance Retail and
Titan Company
's Tanishq - said demand was robust in the October-December quarter.
Titan in an investor note said the growth in gold last quarter exceeded the studded sales growth despite elevated prices and volatility. The company's jewellery division reported sales growth of 21%.
Reliance Retail's chief financial officer Dinesh Taluja told analysts on Friday that the jewellery store format had a ""very good"" last quarter, driven by the festive and wedding buying season with its highest ever sales last Dhanteras.

The country's largest retailer also grew electronic sales by 19% year-on-year last quarter. Taluja said there was a ""strong surge in demand for large-screen TVs (55 and 65 inches) during the World Cup"" while a number of flagship mobile phone model launches during the quarter ""contributed pretty significantly to the performance of phones as well as other categories"".
The smartphone market grew by 20% last quarter after five consecutive quarters of decline in sales and shipments, according to market researcher Canalys.
The premium segment witnessed robust growth due to easy financing options, incentive schemes for retailers and rising disposable income, it said.
Premiumisation was visible in other segments as well last quarter.
Retailers saw transaction values go up even as overall sales growth remained muted. The average transaction value at Shoppers Stop rose 6% on year to ₹5,047 during the quarter while its overall sales grew 4%. The departmental store chain said it wants to increase the contribution of premium brands from 47% of total sales to 55% by FY25, and launch two premium concept stores and 4-5 new brands by then.
""Despite the overall muted market conditions, customers have upped their spends on the differentiated mix of premium brands and experiences across various categories,"" said Kavindra Mishra, chief executive officer of Shoppers Stop.
India's largest consumer goods maker
Hindustan Unilever
, which on Friday reported a flat sales growth in the December quarter as an impact of price reductions, said
premium products
drove sales in categories like fabric wash.
Also, premium non-winter skin care range did well in the category despite delayed winter impacting overall sales, it said. However, in most of the categories, sales of entry-to-mid-segment products are either flat or growing marginally as consumer sentiments remain poor amidst continuing inflation in staples and daily use products.
Chief executives have forecasted a progressive improvement in demand from the first quarter of next fiscal, buoyed by increased activities and campaign spendings during the general elections, increase in government spending, recovery in winter crop sowing, better crop realisation, and forecasts of normal summer and monsoon seasons.

""We have received a communication from the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) regarding misleading product claims by certain seller(s) and investigating them for violations. In the interim, we are taking appropriate action against such listings as per our policies,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.
On Friday, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) filed a complaint against the marketplace, alleging that it was engaged in deceptive trade practices with one of its sellers exploiting ""religious sentiments for commercial gains"".

franchise route
to sell the

to consumers directly, said a senior official.
It will also employ mass media to create awareness about the initiative through which it offers
subsidised kitchen essentials
such as
onion
,
pulses
and
atta
directly to consumers.
""We are looking at opening 50 stores across Delhi,"" the official said. The government is looking for someone to manage and operate the everyday operations of these stores, he added.
Last month the government opened its first two stores at Delhi's Rajiv Chowk metro station, to tap into the high footfall it receives. These are owned by the National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (
NCCF
), which procures agricultural commodities like food grains, pulses, spices, oil seeds, onions and other consumer goods on behalf of the government and sells to consumers at reasonable rates.
ET reported in December that depending on the success of the project in Delhi, the government could open such stores in cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru which also have metro rail networks.

Retailers in a fix as discounts fail to draw buyers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-in-a-fix-as-discounts-fail-to-draw-buyers/articleshow/106938077.cms,18-01-2024,"Demand for lifestyle products and apparel remained weak despite retailers offering discounts of as much as 65% during their ongoing end of season sales (
EOSS
).
Most brands also advanced their EOSS by two weeks to early December compared to January, hoping to mop up sales before ecommerce platforms begin their Republic Day sales.
""There is definitely a stress in the mass value segment and everyone was expecting EOSS to provide much needed momentum to the sale. But the growth is tepid and we are hoping the summer will be better,"" said Manish Kapoor, managing director of Pepe Jeans.
ET Bureau
According to industry experts, the apparel retail sector is likely to face another quarter of slowdown and any recovery is expected only after April. Most of the brands have reported flat to low single-digit same store sales growth during Q3FY24, according to
ICICI Securities
. EOSS helps retailers liquidate unsold inventory before the new season merchandise arrives.
""Despite discounts, growth is still muted and we see no signs of recovery during the January-March quarter. With the rise in disposable income, people are preferring to spend the money on leisure and travel but we hope demand to be back in April onwards,"" said

The fashion retail segment has been struggling with a demand slowdown since January 2023 due to inflationary headwinds. Overall retail growth slowed to 6% in both March and April, increasing marginally to 9% in August and September before slowing to a 7% increase in October and November, according to the
Retailers Association of India
.
""While restaurants continue to do well, there is a stress in fashion retail and the growth is mainly due to the store expansion. However, we believe this is temporary as there will be demand for physical retail and brands need to regularly reinvent themselves,"" said Muhammad Ali, CEO, Forum Malls of
Prestige
group.
ICICI Securities surveyed India's top seven retail companies - Shoppers Stop,
Reliance Trends
, Lifestyle, Pantaloons, VMART, Max, Westside - and found that at 66%,
Shoppers Stop
is offering the maximum discount against peers at 20-40%. Discounts offered by Reliance Trends, Lifestyle and Pantaloons were 40%, 41% and 42%, respectively. This is largely due to aggressive private label discounting by Shoppers Stop.
Over the past six to eight months, most companies have been either cutting prices or offering steep discounts to clear unsold stocks after price increases across apparel categories last year.
Segment-wise, the value fashion segment remained the most impacted and is yet to attain its pre-pandemic level average sales per sq ft.

The mall & high-street boom
As high-end retailers make a beeline for tier-2 city business, the retail developments in the cities also picked up pace. The total retail stock in these 14 cities stood at 29 million square feet, as of September 2023.

In the three months between July and September 2023, around 2.4 million square feet was added in the 14 cities. Most of it was added in Chandigarh, Jaipur and Lucknow. Also, a similar amount – again 2.4 million square feet – was absorbed across these cities, led by Kochi, Jaipur, and Goa.
“The e-commerce boom, tech-savvy consumer base, growing aspirations and surge in discretionary purchasing are defining the retail growth in tier-II cities. Most non-metro cities are established trade and business hubs and are now witnessing multinational corporations and start-ups setting up offices as well,” said Anshuman Magazine, chairman & CEO, India, Southeast Asia, Middle East & Africa of CBRE.
The retail developments have a healthy mix of malls and high streets. But, they too are evolving from vanilla stores in high-streets to malls by top-end developers. A lot of high-end malls have also come up in recent times like Nexus Elante Mall in Chandigarh; World Trade Park Mall in Jaipur; DLF Mall in Panjim and more.
“Investment-grade developers are setting up large-sized contemporary malls in these cities, which are seen as an entertainment destination and not just as a place to shop,” adds Magazine.

Open IPs are intellectual properties that are not licensed to specific companies, and which do not restrict anyone to leverage an event for merchandise sales.
While Ayodhya has a current population of about 350,000 people, travel and tourism industry executives expect eight to ten times as many people to visit the temple town in the coming days.
""The spiritualism and back-to-roots wave is leading to an unprecedented surge in sales of Ram Mandir-related categories,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, chief executive of the
Retailers Association of India
. Companies are leveraging mega event across categories. Airline SpiceJet announced on Friday that it will operate a special flight service from Delhi to Ayodhya on January 21 for devotees participating in

High street retail set to take off big,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/high-street-retail-set-to-take-off-big/articleshow/106707852.cms,11-01-2024,"India’s high street space is set to expand substantially with some big
developers
including
DLF
, M3M,
Omaxe
, Group 108, and Dhillon Group looking to develop about three million square feet of retail projects with
open spaces
in the next 2-3 years.
There is a significant demand for
high street retail
space across
Indian cities
as the supply remains constrained with most developers focused on building large
shopping malls
, industry insiders said.
India has only 13.2 million sq ft of high street space available for retailers, while malls occupy seven times that space at 93 million sq ft, according to data by Cushman & Wakefield.
At the same time, potential consumption at a high street is almost three times more than in a mall, the consultancy firm said.
“India lacks modern organised high streets despite old markets doing quite well,” said Karan Dhillon, owner of Dhillon Group. “As a developer, we realised it and planned high street retail in Chandigarh, adding 1.5 million sq ft,” he said. Brands opening outlets in this new high street space in Chandigarh include Uniqlo, Starbucks, Decathlon and McDonald, Dhillon said.

DLF, India’s largest listed real estate company, recently launched commercial plotted development in Gurgaon, spread across 8.69 acres. This will be developed as high street market on the line of DLF Galleria, which commands rental at par with the grade A malls in the region, company officials said.
M3M recently announced a luxury high street retail and ‘Pentsuites’ – or, serviced studio apartments – as part of a commercial project in Noida. The project will be developed on a three-acre land parcel with saleable space of about 900,000 square feet – 550,000 square feet in retail and 350,000 square feet for studio apartments.
“The recent surge in demand for high-street projects can be linked to the renewed interest in a hybrid model that integrates offices, retail spaces, recreational facilities, and food zones into a unified structure,” said Mohit Goel, managing director of Omaxe Group. “High streets have garnered positive feedback from tenants and investors due to their convenience and diverse amenities, attracting shoppers,” he said.
Omaxe is developing over two million sq ft of
retail space
in different cities, majority of which is high street.
RISING DEMAND
Prominent high streets in India command better rentals than malls.
Rentals at Delhi’s Khan Market, for example, recently hit a record high of Rs 1,600 per sq ft per month, almost double of the costliest retail location of Mumbai and about four times that of Bengaluru.
Recently, Titan leased 18,000 sq ft at Delhi’s South Extension in one of the biggest transactions at a high street location.
Many brands, particularly in fashion and food & beverages (F&B) sectors, have been scouting for spaces in prominent high street locations.
Poor availability of organised high streets in the country is one of the reasons for that, but there are other factors driving demand for high street retail space.
Experts said fewer restrictions during Covid-led lockdowns at high streets made retailers prefer the open locations over malls, which either remained shut or operated with strict regulations for several months.
Consequently, prominent high streets were the earliest retail hubs to resume operation after lockdown restrictions were relaxed post the first Covid wave.
“A distinctive feature of high-street projects is the presence of retail spaces at lower levels and office spaces at upper floors, seamlessly integrated into the local environment,” said Amish Bhutani, managing director of Group 108. “Investors particularly favour high-street projects due to their adaptability, making them a sound business proposition,” he said.
Group 108’s project in Noida called One FNG offers 3.8 million sq ft of office space and 300,000 sq ft of retail space.

Retailers Association of India recommends lower taxes to boost the consumer sentiment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-association-of-india-recommends-lower-taxes-to-boost-the-consumer-sentiment/articleshow/106702272.cms,10-01-2024,"Retailers Association of India
has recommended the central government that the
Union Budget
for FY 23–24 should focus on
generating demand
and
spurring consumption
by offering benefits or concessions in the form of
lower taxes
.
The association said that it will boost the overall consumer sentiment and benefit the retail sector. Tax benefits and relief to individual tax payers will increase the monthly disposable income and support consumption.
“The budget must prioritize growth-oriented measures to stimulate demand and consumption. The budget should outline supportive policies, simplified regulations, skill development and simple goods and services tax (GST) norms to aid in the development of the retail industry,” said RAI.
Retailing in India is one of the pillars of its economy and accounts for about 10 percent of its GDP. The Indian retail market is estimated to be worth $1 trillion and is expected to reach $2 trillion by 2032. India is one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world.
“There is a need to provide lower interest rate to the retailers through the special announcement in the budget to assure easier financing for the Retail businesses. The government should allocate a special fund and formulate a special trader finance scheme with SIDBI to help millions of independent retailers across the nation by declaring low-cost loans and relaxing some industry guidelines,” RAI has said.

E-commerce platforms can't become haven for counterfeiters: Delhi HC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/e-commerce-platforms-cant-become-haven-for-counterfeiters-delhi-hc/articleshow/106596371.cms,06-01-2024,"New Delhi, An e-commerce platform cannot become a haven for infringers of intellectual property and have such a system which provides an avenue to counterfeiters, the Delhi High
Court
has said. The court observed that e-commerce websites are commercial ventures and are inherently profit oriented, which is not objectionable, but they have to protect intellectual property
rights
of others.
""An e-commerce platform cannot become a haven for infringers. Men are not angels. Where easy
money
is visible, the conscience at times takes a nap,"" said Justice C
Hari Shankar
in a recent order.
""E-commerce websites are commercial ventures, and are inherently profit oriented. There is, of course, nothing objectionable in this; but, while ensuring their highest returns, such websites have also to sedulously protect intellectual property rights of others. They cannot, with a view to further their financial gains,
put
in
place
a protocol by which infringers and counterfeiters are provided an avenue to infringe and counterfeit. Any such protocol has to meet with firm judicial disapproval,"" the judge stated.
The court's observations came while dealing with a lawsuit by sportswear brand Puma SE which alleged that e-commerce platform
Indiamart
was being used by various sellers to peddle its counterfeit goods.
The platform submitted that it was not the originator of the information relating to the goods put up for sale on its website as it was merely a space-provider and would be willing to take down any listing put up by a counterfeiter when it is brought to its notice.
Live Events
In its interim order, the court observed that counterfeiting is a well-known commercial evil, even in the virtual world, and e-commerce platforms are statutorily required to make reasonable efforts to ensure that infringing content is not posted on its website and the platform is not used for selling counterfeit goods.
It said that prima facie, the e-commerce platform in the instant case aided the commission of the unlawful act of counterfeiting and infringement and it cannot claim the benefit of ""safe harbour"" from
liability
under the
Information Technology Act
.
""There is nothing inherently illegal in IIL (IndiaMART IndiaMESH Ltd) providing a drop down menu from which prospective sellers, on the Indiamart platform, can select the brand which they intend to sell. If, however, there are not, in place, sufficient checks and balances to prevent counterfeiters from misrepresenting themselves as genuine sellers, the protocol cannot withstand judicial scrutiny,"" the court stated.
The court directed taking down of all infringing listings in relation to Puma on Indiamart while also asking the platform to not provide any of the registered Puma trademarks in respect of any goods as search options in the drop down menu presented to prospective sellers at the time of their registration.
""IIL can well seek modification, or even vacation, of the order, if it can demonstrate to the Court that it has put, in place, sufficient regulatory and protective measures to render impossible abuse of the Indiamart platform by counterfeiters. Till then, however, the present position, in which there is rampant counterfeiting ' or even the possibility of it ' on the Indiamart platform, cannot be allowed to continue,"" the court said.

Noel Tata-led Trent charts expansion plan riding private label-only model,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/trent-charts-expansion-plan-riding-private-label-only-model/articleshow/106553731.cms,05-01-2024,"Mumbai: Noel Tata-led chain
Trent
, which owns
Westside
, Zudio and Star Bazaar, has built a
business model
around selling
private labels
(owned brands), and its chief executive believes there is no reason just yet to deviate from this pronouncedly singular script for the
Tata Group
retailing business.
""We have growing conviction in our model. The Trent playbook works. Many of these choices and disciplines are culturally anchored and that makes a difference,"" Trent CEO P Venkatesalu told ET.
The company's
revenues
climbed substantially over the past five years, to ₹8,242 crore in FY23 from ₹2,157 crore in FY18. Concurrently, the net profit surged nearly five-fold to ₹394 crore. The stock has sparkled, too. Last year, Trent more than doubled in value, outpacing the 20% returns for the Nifty50. Over a two-year span, the stock nearly tripled, while the Nifty climbed 27% in the period.
Trent achieved another milestone in December by becoming the fifth listed
Tata
Group company to surpass a market capitalisation of Rs 1 lakh crore.
P Venkatesalu, 46, took charge as CEO in 2021 and has worked closely with
Noel Tata
over the years. He was earlier CFO of the company.

Exclusively Tata
Trent is probably the only retailer in the country to compete with a completely private label portfolio. Trent's brands are not sold on any other ecommerce sites, except Tata platforms (Tata Neu/TataCliq).
""In the fashion space, we will only sell our own brands. This has allowed us to experiment, learn and get to what resonates with consumers. Whether it is Westside, Zudio or Star, there are common threads to what we do. It is a curated offering. We want to be direct to consumers and have complete ownership of our brand relationship with our consumers."" said Venkatesalu.
The Zudio format has become a hit with value seeking consumers, prompting clones by other retailing chains. It contributes as much as 30% to total revenues, from 8% a few years ago. The total number of Westside and Zudio stores is estimated to be 800 this year, from 261 in 2020.
Noel Tata has recently stated that the retailer is applying the Trent playbook to the Star business and that it is witnessing strong customer traction, instilling a growing conviction to build out this growth engine in the food and grocery space.
""We are confident that this business is well poised to shift gears and deliver substantial value to customers and shareholders going forward,"" Venkatesalu said.
Star has adopted a calibrated approach to expansion, with stores in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat. It has a network of more than 800 farmers and sources more than 80% of its vegetables and 60% of fruits directly from farmers.
Traditionally, Trent had been slower to expand unlike other retail firms as it focused on a profitable model. The company has consistently delivered robust financial results, boasting a 31% and 26% compound annual growth rate in revenues and profits, respectively, over the past five years.

Top global apparel brands and retailers doubled sales in India over the past two years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/top-global-apparel-brands-and-retailers-doubled-sales-in-india-over-the-past-two-years/articleshow/106552297.cms,05-01-2024,"Top global apparel and fast fashion brands appear to have struck a strong chord with young customers, racking up sales growth of anywhere between 40% and 60% in FY23, bucking the trend in a market where the overall demand for discretionary products slowed down.
For instance, Swedish fashion retailer H&M and rival
Zara
reported a 40% increase in its topline while Japanese brand
Uniqlo
saw a 60% jump in sales. American denim maker
Levi Strauss
and British brand Marks & Spencer posted a 54% increase, latest filings with the Registrar of Companies showed. Dubai-based department store Lifestyle International, too, saw a 46% jump in revenues on a large base. These brands garnered combined annual revenues of nearly $2.6 billion, more than double compared to FY21 when it was $1.1 billion all put together.
""With consumers getting brand conscious, global brands have a natural advantage. There is a distinct aspirational momentum for international brands that carries them through. Also they can sustain having unsold inventory and discounting better than smaller peers,"" said Devangshu Dutta, founder of Third Eyesight, a strategy consulting firm. ""Also, these brands have not yet reached saturation point in terms of network and hence can invest further to widen their reach.""
ET Bureau
The revenue surge was also led by brands' shifting focus on ecommerce, which now accounts for more than a quarter of their sales, even as they face intensify competition from both local and global rivals in an increasingly crowded market where web-commerce firms continue to offer steep discounts. Over the past two years, sales growth for most retailers have been price-led, reversing the historic trend when volumes or actual demand drove a bulk of the sales.
Live Events
The fashion retail segment has been struggling with a demand slowdown since January last year due to inflationary headwinds. The overall retail growth slowed down to 6% in both March and April, increasing marginally to 9% in August and September before falling slightly to 7% in October and November, according to the Retailers Association of India.
""Spends are shifting to experience, holidays and big ticket purchases such as cars. Stronger retailers which had the right product to price proposition works for consumers who are not necessarily looking at brands from global and local lens. What helped our sales was product rationalisation, renovation of stores as well as our value proposition,"" said Manish Kapoor, managing director at Pepe Jeans that clocked 54% growth to Rs560 crore in FY23. ""The current fiscal has been muted and we expect election spending and improved sentiment to drive recovery next fiscal.
As the world’s second most-populated country, India is an attractive market for aspirational apparel brands as rising disposable incomes cause the consuming base of the pyramid to broaden further. ""The Indian economy is on course to be among the top economies in the world. The key factors driving the India consumption story include a large proportion of young population, rising urbanization, growing affluence, increasing discretionary spending and deeper penetration of digital,"" said Levi Strauss in its latest annual report.
Last year Levi's said India is now the largest market for them within Asia and sixth largest globally while M&S said it is opening a store every month in India, already its largest international market outside home in terms of store network.

"Consumption in organised retail grew at 9.3% in H1 FY24, says CMS Info Systems",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/consumption-in-organised-retail-to-grow-at-9-3-in-h1-fy24-says-cms-info-systems/articleshow/106507472.cms,03-01-2024,"Pune: CMS Info Systems has revealed key
consumption trends
in
organised retail
segment in the first half of FY24, through a comprehensive analysis spanning 11 consumer-facing sectors, such as large format retail,
jewelry
,
FMCG
,
e-commerce
,
hospitality
, and aviation, among others.
""Retail Consumption Trends by CMS is a macroeconomic indicator of
retail
purchases based on the cash collected & processed from 52,000+ organized retail touchpoints across India. It provides a view into consumers’ spending trends as seen in FY24 compared to FY23, which included the Cricket World Cup event, festival, and wedding season. The analysis takes a closer look at consumer preferences through the demographic lens, offering trends into consumer behavior in the country by measuring in-store and online retail purchases across various sectors,"" said CMS in a media release.
According to CMS, in the B2C segment, retail consumption witnessed an annual increase of 9.3% in the key 11 sectors, during the April–September 2023 period. The FMCG and E-commerce sectors experienced an annual increase of 26.2% and 19.4% respectively, during Q2-FY24, reflecting rising consumer demand in these sectors amid easing inflation. The Aviation and Hospitality sectors saw annual growth of 29.7% and 12.8% in Q2-FY24 respectively, reflecting increased demand for travel, driven by large events such as the Cricket World Cup. The jewelry sector saw an annual growth of 7.1%, in contrast to a 4.6% decline in Q2-FY23, suggesting higher spending triggered by the wedding season and endorsing post-pandemic demand bounce-back. The large format retail sector experienced an annual increase of 7.8% in Q2-FY24, driven by factors such as rising incomes, urbanization, and changing consumer preferences, the CMS analysis showed.
""From a demographic perspective, Metro cities which had grown the fastest from Q2-FY23 to Q1-FY24, were outpaced in H1 FY24 by SURU (semi-urban and rural), which saw the fastest consumption growth of 9.2% YoY, triggered by improved discretionary spending and demonstrating tailwinds in the rural economy,"" said CMS.
Anush Raghavan, President, Cash Management Solutions at CMS Info Systems said, ""CMS Cash Index™ (CCI) has proven to be a very powerful indicator to track commerce transactions by consumers and has been referred to by various policymakers as well. The surge in retail consumption parallels the 7.6% GDP growth in the Q2-FY24, boosted by easing inflation.Taking cues from these macroeconomic indicators, we expect astronger consumption growth in Q3-FY24, especially in FMCG, e-commerce, and aviation sectors.""

Thoda achhe wala dikhao: The year Indian shoppers went premium,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/thoda-achhe-wala-dikhao-the-year-indian-shoppers-went-premium/articleshow/106399872.cms,30-12-2023,"In October, Titan Company Limited said it was all set to launch an invite-only retail store which will sell luxury jewellery with a minimum ticket size of ₹10 lakh. Titan was not alone in focusing on rich buyers not shy of splurging their money on premium products. Companies in several sectors from FMCG to auto to durables to housing tried to lure the rich customers. As early as in February, Italian super-luxury carmaker Lamborghini, which retails cars upwards of Rs 4 crore, was already sold out for the year in India.
How premiumisation gathered pace
Premiumisation is a trend that continues from the pandemic times when locked-in affluent people splurged on large TVs and washing machines and expensive food and liquor. But in 2023, the crack in India's consumer demand seemed to widen into a split, as companies struggled to sell low-priced goods while luxury, high-priced items flew off the shelves. At least the phenomenon came to be perceived as a definite turn in the market in 2023. It developed into a major trend in 2023 when companies wooed the rich consumers to compensate for lower sales and falling margins.
While those at the lower income levels largely remained reluctant to open their purse strings after the pandemic ravaged the economy, the rich splurged on luxury items. While makers of two-wheelers and FMCG companies hoped for a demand revival in rural India, the luxury goods market witnessed high sales, with India's rich splurging on expensive cars, homes, watches, etc.
Customers at the lower end, whose incomes took a beating during the pandemic, were further weighed down by inflation while the rich, who could not spend during the pandemic, indulged in revenge shopping.
Live Events
From premium packs to ultra-luxury homes
FMCG consumers had started uptrading right in the beginning of the year 2023. Changes in price-pack contributions across six key categories in the March quarter of 2023 showed more consumers up-traded to high-value packs as compared to the same quarter of the previous year, TOI had reported. The shift was seen in beverages, personal care and branded commodities, according to data from Bizom, a platform that automates retail execution at 7.5 million kirana stores, In personal care, consumers up-traded from low-price packs (up to Rs 50) - which shrank 6.8% during the quarter under consideration - to medium- (Rs 50-200) and high-value (Rs 200-plus) price packs, which grew by 2.7% and 4.1%, respectively.
The consumption pattern for groceries and household products shows a sharp divergence, segmentally. There is a greater demand for pricier, more discretionary products like cosmetics in urban markets where the per capita FMCG consumption is 1.5-2 times the national average.
However, the same categories are under stress in rural areas where consumers are either downtrading to cheaper products or shifting to local brands. There is a huge demand, mostly in rural areas, for products of small and regional companies, especially in categories such as detergents, soaps, snacks and tea where the raw material costs have fallen. This is reflected in a slower pace of growth for many large, listed companies such as HUL and Britannia, especially at the mass end and in rural markets.
In 2021, the entry-level (sub-Rs 10,000) smartphone segment accounted for 35% of the market. It fell to 30% in the eight months to August this year. The premium segment, above Rs 30,000 a unit, accounted for 8% back then, and has climbed to 17% in the same period, Counterpoint Research data showed.
Mumbai, the country’s largest and most expensive real estate market, has been setting new benchmarks with property transactions. Several large-ticket record-setting transactions involving industrialists, CXOs, actors, and sports personalities have been taking place in the country's commercial capital since the last few quarters. In February an image went viral on micro-blogging site X, (previously Twitter) showing a massive crowd in front of the DLF office in Gurgaon to buy the Rs 7.2 crore luxury flats. Close to five hundred flats at Arbour, DLF's first high-rise condominium after nearly a decade, on Golf Course Extension Road, were reportedly sold out within three days of launch.
In Q3 2021, affordable housing’s share in overall sales was 26%, mid-segment’s was 50% and luxury and premium housing’s was 22%, according to CBRE. In Q3 2023, the share of affordable housing dipped to 16% and that of mid-segment declined to 46%. Meanwhile the share of premium and luxury houses went up to 35%, as the well-off went for bigger and better homes.
The upbeat demand at the premium end was reflected in the performance of listed hotel chains too. In the first half of FY2024, Indian Hotels Company reported a net profit of Rs 415 crore, up by 34%, y-o-y. Madhavan Menon, executive chairman, Thomas Cook (India) Limited, told ET that the pandemic had created a mind set of YOLO (you only live once) and fuelled the desire for new experiences and bucket list-led travel.
Sales of premium televisions having screen size of 55 inches and above grew by 18% in the first six months of FY2024, y-o-y, while the overall smart television market declined by 5% in the same period, as per industry tracker Counterpoint Research. In washing machines, sales of premium, frontloading models grew by 20% in April-September, y-o-y, while the overall segment grew by only 2%, as per industry estimates.
The lure of
EMIs
Easy financing has played a big role in elevating purchasing power and fuelling demand for premium products. Since there are very low profit margins in the heavily discounted low-end segments, retailers find it profitable to shift the consumer by upgrading them to a higher end product through a comfortable EMI package. Consumers walk into showrooms looking for an affordable brand but are converted quickly by the lure of easy EMIs and a better product — be it a phone, laptop, AC, television, or even a car, an industry executive had told ET.
The wave in small towns
Though demand in rural areas have largely remained suppressed, premiumisation also spread to small towns as Indians shift up the income pyramid and even small towns now have a class of consumers willing to splurge on premium products. Aspirational buying, the spread of e-commerce and digital payments, and social media whetting consumer appetite have now taken demand for premium products to small towns too.
Nestle India Chairman & MD Suresh Narayanan had told ET in July that small-town India too is moving from single packs to multi-packs and from multi-packs to premium brands. ""If I can go to Gopiganj and find KitKat being picked up by the consumer by name, that tells me that the premiumisation brand journey has also arrived in those towns,"" he said. This new premiumisation trend, Narayanan said, is happening across categories, whether it is prepared dishes, chocolates, confectionery, coffee, milks and nutrition, health science, pet care or cereals. ""Wherever we are in, premiumisation is becoming an important element because consumers are wanting better quality, better value, better aspiration brands as far as their portfolio of consumption is concerned, that is one part.
""We are surprised that some of our premium packs of coffee and chocolates are seeing a surge in demand from really small towns. Distributors too are asking us for stocks. And such markets are serviceable now. Earlier, many of these markets had no roads,"" Narayanan had told ET.
Nestle is not the only company witnessing this new trend. Tata's jewellery and watch brands are also growing in smaller cities. ""The contribution of top 10 cities has declined 4-5% and gone in favour of tier 3, 4 cities. That long-term trend is indisputable and every retailer has to pay attention to these markets,"" Ashok Sonthalia, chief financial officer of Tata Group-backed Titan Company, which sells watches under the Titan and Fastrack labels besides jewellery brands Tanishq, CaratLane and Mia, along with Skinn perfumes and Taneira sarees, told ET in June.

Major e-commerce trends that can reshape the industry in 2024,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/major-e-commerce-trends-that-can-shape-the-industry-in-2024/articleshow/106358005.cms,29-12-2023,"India
's
e-commerce industry
is experiencing
rapid growth
, fueled by the country's
digitization
and expanding internet user base. Advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality, are expected to revolutionize the
online shopping
experience.
According to Google's latest report, India's
internet economy
is projected to reach a staggering $1 trillion by 2030, a sixfold increase from $175 billion in 2022. This remarkable growth is driven by the increasing penetration of e-commerce in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, which were previously underserved by traditional retail.
The trajectory of India's e-commerce industry indicates its inevitable rise to become the world's second-largest by 2034, with an anticipated annual gross merchandise value of $350 billion by 2030.
As per the report, e-commerce will achieve a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27 percent, reaching $163 billion by 2026. This growth rate is nearly three times that of the overall retail market.
""The factors driving this rapid growth include increasing internet penetration, rising disposable incomes, and the convenience of online shopping. As more consumers from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities embrace online shopping, the demand for e-commerce platforms and services is expected to continue growing. Five key trends are going to define the e-commerce industry in 2024,"" e-commerce expert Sachin Verma, the founder of FEDUS, said.

AI is expected to play a significant role in the future of e-commerce. Advancements in AI technology will enable businesses to personalize customer experiences, improve recommendation systems, and streamline operations through automation. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants will enhance customer service and provide real-time support.
Social Commerce:
Social commerce, which combines the power of social media with e-commerce platforms, is an emerging trend. The vast user base and engagement on social media platforms will drive sales and increase brand awareness.
""Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are becoming not just spaces for social interaction but also vibrant marketplaces where users can discover, share, and buy products seamlessly. The potential for direct interaction with customers, real-time feedback, and the ability to leverage influencers for marketing make social commerce a game-changer,"" Sachin Verma said.
Sustainable shopping:
Sustainable shopping has become increasingly important in the e-commerce industry. Consumers are now more conscious of the environmental impact of their purchases and actively seek sustainable and eco-friendly products. E-commerce platforms can support this trend by offering a wide range of sustainable options, providing transparent information about product sourcing and manufacturing processes, and promoting responsible consumption practices.
""E-commerce will continue to drive competitive logistics, shortening delivery times and reducing carbon emissions through efficient transportation and packaging methods. These platforms will witness a surge in sales of Indian-made products, empowering small businesses and showcasing India's rich cultural heritage to a global audience,"" Sachin Verma said.
These e-commerce trends are expected to shape the industry in the coming years. Additionally, personalized shopping experiences and advanced data analytics will also play a crucial role in understanding consumer preferences and improving customer satisfaction.

Strong need for a reward currency for direct to consumer brands: e-Commerce enabler POP,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/strong-need-for-a-reward-currency-for-direct-to-consumer-brands-e-commerce-enabler-pop/articleshow/106350257.cms,28-12-2023,"e-Commerce enabler
POP says it expects to expand its rewards coin user-base to 8 million by the end of next year, from 1.5 million at present led by new launches of
e-commerce marketplace
and payment instruments lined-up. In addition, more than 1000 brands are expected to issue and allow redemption of
POP
coins on their e-commerce websites by the end of 2024, it said.
“We will be launching payment instruments which will be integrated with the POP app that will accelerate earning of the coins. These will allow users to buy from over 1000 new age brands across multiple categories of fashion, beauty, food, home and electronics for all their lifestyle needs,” said Bhargav Errangi, founder and chief executive officer of POP.
Since its launch in early May this year, the company has already roped in 100 brands on its network, offering its rewards currency POPcoins and replacing traditional loyalty programs and points system. POP’s currency can be redeemed across various brands, similar to an alternate form of payment currency during shopping.
The company said Indian Gen-Z consumers are aspirational and are constantly looking to upgrade their lifestyle. Being digital natives, they will become the primary drivers of online retail consumption in India in the next decade. While they are open to trying new-age internet first D2C brands and often buy from multiple stand-alone brand websites, these online brand-stores have their own individual loyalty programs which are unstructured and difficult to comprehend.
“There is a which helps these customers avail benefits across their favourite brands without having to go through individual loyalty programs. This also helps brands get access to a customer base that is open to exploring new products online,” added Errangi, a former senior director of Flipkart, and has a track record of scaling loyalty programs like Payback and Flipkart Supercoins.

"As year ends, apparel retailers flash sale signs to lure buyers",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/as-year-ends-apparel-retailers-flash-sale-signs-to-lure-buyers/articleshow/106220785.cms,23-12-2023,"New Delhi: Demand for apparel and lifestyle products during the last quarter of 2023 is likely to be subdued despite the festive season as shoppers continue to stay away, belying retailers' expectations of double-digit growth.
Given the delayed winter, many retailers have now started discounting early to attract shoppers. Retail sales in October and November 2023 showed a growth of 7% compared to the sales levels during the same period in 2022, according to the survey by the
Retailers Association of India
(RAI).
""The last two-three months have seen muted growth despite being the festive season and the way things are going, we don't expect any major uptick in demand for the next two quarters. Peak winter has not set in which has impacted the sales and we hope by June onwards, there will be some positive movements in demand,"" said
Devarajan Iyer
, chief executive of department store chain Lifestyle International.
The
fashion retail segment
has been struggling with a demand slowdown since January this year due to inflationary headwinds.
Live Events
The overall growth slowed down to 6% in both March and April, according to the RAI, indicating the slowest sales expansion in more than 14 months and increasing marginally to 9% in August and September.
""In comparison with the last festive season, this festive season has been muted. This has forced us to rethink the store expansion strategy,"" said Lalit Agarwal, chairman of hypermarket chain V-Mart.
ET visited stores of brands like Marks N Spencer and Lifestyle, who agreed that festive sales were low this year. Allen Solly said the growth is not much, whereas Shoppers Stop at a prominent mall said that the footfall in the malls was low but was higher in the local markets.
Due to the low festive sales, brands like Pantaloons have high hopes for winter sales. H&M said that the reason behind the delayed winter sales in their brand is also the long Black Friday sales.
""Retailers had anticipated double-digit sales growth during the Puja and Diwali seasons in October and November. However, the sales growth has been muted for many retailers. Most retailers have indicated that the footfalls were not even equal to 2022 though the sales were just about the same as last year,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, RAI.
Segment-wise, the value fashion segment remained more impacted than the premium one and is yet to attain its pre-pandemic level average sales per square foot.
""With sales of homes and cars going up, taking the largest share of the wallet, people are preferring to spend the balance on experiences. Hence, there is an uptick in demand for travel and F&B and apparel sales are impacted,"" said Pankaj Renjhen, chief operating officer at Anarock Retail.
Over the past 6-8 months, most companies have been either slashing price tags or offering steep discounts to clear unsold inventory after price increases across all apparel categories last year.
""Many retailers, especially in the apparel category, only grew over last year because of new store openings and online sales. While like-for-like store business was negative in more than 50% of the retailers surveyed. Retailers did witness a growth in high-value products,"" said Rajagopalan.

Organised food & grocery retailers topline seen clipping at 14-15 per cent next fiscal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/organised-food-grocery-retailers-topline-seen-clipping-at-14-15-per-cent-next-fiscal/articleshow/106215618.cms,22-12-2023,"A healthy demand from small towns will help brick-and-mortar
food
and
grocery
retailers log 14-15 per cent revenue growth next fiscal in spite of rising competition from
e-commerce platforms
, says a report. Last year, the segment clipped at a record 30 per cent and the projected 14-15 per cent growth, translating to three years of strong growth on the trot. This year the industry is expected to clip at 15 per cent,
Crisil Ratings
said in a note on Friday.
But modest demand from the discretionary segment comprising general merchandise such as
crockery
,
home appliances
and utensils, and apparel, due to inflationary pressures, will keep their operating margins range-bound at 6-6.5 per cent in the current and next fiscals, down from 6.9 per cent last fiscal, the report said.
Food and non-food grocery segments contribute 75-77 per cent of revenue for F&G retailers, and the balance from discretionary products, which offer relatively higher margins.
Strong cash flows and steady working capital cycle will limit the players' dependence on external debt, ensuring strong balance sheets and stable credit profiles, said the report based on an analysis of six players that account for a fourth of the Rs 2.4-lakh-crore organised F&G market.
According to Poonam Upadhyay, a director with the agency, healthy demand outlook and low penetration will ensure mid-teen revenue growth this fiscal and the next. She also expects area addition to increase 20 per cent cumulatively over fiscals 2024 and 2025 on top of a substantial 40 per cent increase in fiscals 2022 and 2023.

Ajio set to become Reliance Retail's first profitable online venture,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ajio-set-to-become-reliance-retails-first-profitable-online-venture/articleshow/106191491.cms,22-12-2023,"Reliance Retail
's online
fashion business
,
Ajio
, is set to turn
profitable
this month, becoming the first
online venture
of the country's largest retail group to achieve the mark, two senior industry
executives
aware of the matter said.
Ajio is expected to post '6-8 crore in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) in December, the executives said.
The company achieved profitability for multiple reasons: a premiumisation trend in the market helped Reliance with a huge international brand portfolio improve the average billing value, while it brought down logistic cost by fulfilling most orders from the physical stores nearer to the delivery point and reducing return rates, they said.
""Reliance wanted profitability in Ajio by this fiscal year and it is achieving it in December itself. The focus going forward will be on profitable growth since Reliance doesn't want to burn money when the business has achieved scale,"" one of the executives said.

An email sent to Reliance Retail seeking comment remained unanswered at Thursday press time.
Reliance
had started Ajio in 2017.
Ajio reduced marketing cost with five different storefronts for each consumer class. It lined up 4,000 stock points for last-mile fulfilment, including Reliance Retail's nearest store for delivery, which brought down logistic cost at the operational level. Also, return rates reduced to around 28% of orders from 35-36% earlier.
Ajio is posting annual sales of $2 billion in terms of gross merchandise value, with 51% of the business coming from the Reliance Retail portfolio and the balance 49% from its own and exclusive brands. It competes with Myntra, Amazon and Flipkart in the online fashion space.
Around 15 million people buy fashion online, while another 30 million buy from both online and offline stores.

Indian retailers see weak festive boost; get 7% sales growth against double-digit expectation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-anticipate-double-digit-sales-in-festive-season-see-7-growth-instead/articleshow/106182097.cms,21-12-2023,"Retail sales
in October and November 2023 showed a growth of mere 7% as compared to the sales levels during the same period in 2022 despite the festive season, according to the survey by Retailers Association of
India
(RAI).
Over the past 6-8 months, most companies have been either slashing price tags or offering steep discounts to clear unsold inventory after price increases across all apparel categories last year.
“Retailers had anticipated double-digit sales growth during the Puja and Diwali season in October and November 2023 however, the sales growth has been muted for many retailers. Most retailers have indicated that the footfalls were not even equal to 2022 though the sales were just about the same as previous year,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI).
Retail businesses across regions have indicated growth in sales as compared to October and November 2022 sales level with East India signaling a growth of 11%, while South India indicated a growth of 7% followed by North India and West India signalling a growth of 6% and 5% respectively.
“Many retailers, especially in the apparel category, only grew over last year because of new store openings and online sales. While like-for-like store business was negative in more than 50% of the retailers surveyed. Retailers did witness a growth in high value products,” said Rajagopalan.

Aequs to make Marvel cars for Disney in India & Middle East,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/aequs-to-make-marvel-cars-for-disney-in-india-middle-east/articleshow/106143154.cms,20-12-2023,"Belagavi-headquartered diversified contract manufacturer
Aequs
may soon make its new line of
Marvel toys
for
India
as well as for the countries in the
Middle East
, people in the know told ET.
The company has signed a contract with Stone Sapphire, licensee for
Disney
in India, to design and manufacture collectible pullback cars in
Marvel
superhero colours.
The design process began 18 months ago, and the new car versions in the colours of Captain America,
Black Widow
,
Spiderman
, and 33 other Marvel characters will be available in the markets across India this Christmas. The company plans to expand the existing range even more before proceeding to the next phase, Aravind Melligeri, the US-based founder of Aequs, told ET. “Right now, we can produce 200,000 pieces every month from this new line,” he said. The company is also considering making remote-controlled vehicles, he added.
This is the first time Aequs is manufacturing a toy product solely for the Indian market. While the company creates export-bound toys in the special economic zone part of the Koppal toy cluster, it had to manufacture the new Marvel cars in the domestic tariff area (DTA) of the park.
India, said Melligeri, was an emerging market for global toy brands with the US and European markets on the slow lane. “Revenue figures in the global toy industry have been on the decline for the first three quarters of this calendar year. We expect the decline to be in mid-single digits for the full year 2023, which makes markets like India more attractive,” he added.

The less than two-year old Koppal toy facility, spread across 400 acres in the Kalyana-Karnataka region, is home to three toy making units. The sprawling area can accommodate about 100 units, and the promoters are hopeful of attracting investors in the coming years in the state-of-the-art facility.
The three units put together have made up 700,000 square feet of manufacturing space at Koppal which also makes it one of the largest toy manufacturing facilities in the country. At Belagavi, Aequs operates two toy units with a combined manufacturing space of 600,000 square foot.

RIL pays Rs 254 cr to Metro for using its brand name in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ril-pays-rs-254-cr-to-metro-for-using-its-brand-name-in-india/articleshow/106134424.cms,20-12-2023,"Mumbai:
Reliance Industries
has paid ₹254 crore to
Metro
AG in the financial year ended September 2023 for using the German retailer's
brand name
in India after acquiring its wholesale chain in the country a year ago.
""Metro AG is providing certain transitional services and licences as part of the transaction to enable the new owner to operate the business. As part of the sale of Metro India, a licence payment of ₹28 million (₹254 crore) received in advance for using the Metro brand is recognised in the financial year,"" Metro said in its latest annual report.
Last December, Reliance Retail Ventures, a unit of
RIL
, bought Metro Cash & Carry India for a total cash consideration of ₹2,850 crore. The deal included all 31 wholesale stores and the entire real estate portfolio of six store locations. The sale was completed in May 2023. The wholesale and retail giant said due to the increasing level of market consolidation, accelerated digitalisation and intense competition, Metro India's business is no longer aligned with its core growth strategy.
Metro, in the report, said considering the outgoing cash and including the prepayment for use of the Metro brand, the preliminary net cash inflow for the disposed assets and liabilities amounts to ₹0.3 billion (₹2,731 crore).
""However, positive Ebitda-effective earnings from disposal of its Indian business was ₹150 million (₹1,363 crore), including transaction costs,"" it added.

A 'Star' deal by Mukesh Ambani may give retail giants sleepless nights,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/disney-sony-deals-may-make-it-harder-to-reach-indias-consumers/articleshow/106013321.cms,15-12-2023,"Two large
media
deals in India are giving the likes of Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. a reason to worry: If
entertainment
goes the way of telecom and ends up effectively as a duopoly, will it become costlier for large consumer brands to reach 1.4 billion people?
The first of these two transactions may come as early as Monday and would see Walt
Disney
Co. enter into a non-bidding agreement with
Mukesh Ambani
to merge their media businesses in the country. The richest Asian tycoon will hold at least 51% of the combined television and streaming operations.

Zee-Sony Merger: NCLAT refuses to halt mega merger to create media giant
The second, which is looking half-baked even after being in the oven for more than two years, is expected to meld
Sony
Group Corp.’s local unit with
Zee
Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. But disagreements have reportedly cropped up about who should be the chief executive officer. Although the Sony-Zee accord is mired in doubt ahead of its tight Dec. 21 deadline, it’s reasonably certain that by this time next year the Indian sports and general entertainment market will have consolidated into two large platforms: Ambani’s Viacom18 Media+Disney, and Sony, with or without the Zee merger.
India is a large cable market. For advertisers, TV ads are still five to six times more expensive than their digital alternatives, according to industry professionals. Currently, four networks — Disney, Zee, Sony, and Viacom18’s Colors — have nationwide footprints in cricket and Bollywood-style entertainment in multiple Indian languages. After a merger, Viacom18+Disney will control a third of Hindi general entertainment in northern Indian cities, and more than a quarter of the Tamil market, which has a strong local leader.

Ambani will also gain TV audiences on the country’s west and east coasts and hold about a third of the country’s video-streaming subscribers. More importantly, Ambani will have a lock on cricket. The billionaire has paid $2.7 billion to stream the annual Indian Premier League for five years. From Disney, he will acquire IPL broadcast — as well as a streaming deal for the 2027 Cricket World Cup. In August, Viacom18 beat Disney and Sony to secure TV and digital rights for the Indian team’s home matches for five years.
In a cricket-crazy nation, it makes sense for media firms to invest in the sport. But there is another reason: regulation. Once New Delhi introduces its proposed broadcast bill, stifling state control of content will extend to internet apps, which have already started shelving projects that they fear will get them in trouble with the government. As programming on Netflix Inc., Amazon Prime Video, Disney’s Hotstar+ and Viacom18’s JioCinema becomes uniformly banal — much like television in the country already is — whoever owns cricket will control the eyeballs. Worse still, digital advertising in India doesn’t have reliable numbers on reach and engagement. Advertisers have to trust the apps’ claims.
Brands should worry. Ambani is India’s largest retailer with a long-held ambition to build a consumer-goods empire. So far, though, he has found it hard to shake the dominance of distributor-centered supply chains. It’s a formidable moat. Lever Brothers, one of the companies that would go on to become Unilever, arrived in British-ruled India with crates of “Sunlight,” the world’s first packaged laundry soap, in 1888. It has had 135 years to figure out how to reach every corner of a continent-sized geography at a low cost.
However, Ambani may shift gear and attack demand instead of distribution. If he relentlessly promotes his own staples, fashion and electronics through a bulked-up media empire, he could potentially command a larger share of consumer spending in what’s projected to be a $2 trillion retail market by 2032, more than double last year’s size.
How much of this control of the consumer economy by a single conglomerate actually materializes will depend, among other things, on dominance of media ownership.
For a clue, consider telecom. Ambani’s 2016 entry with free voice calls and cheap data shrank a dozen-player market into two dominant firms: his
Jio
, with 460 million customers, and rival Bharti Airtel Ltd. It also left a third weak competitor in the fray. Vodafone Idea Ltd. is so overwhelmed by what it owes the Indian government for spectrum that it has no money to invest in network upgrade. So it keeps bleeding disgruntled customers to the two leaders. Could the media industry face a similar fate?
Zee investors are no longer sure that Sony will honor the original agreement to make Punit Goenka, who leads the homegrown Indian network founded by his father, the chief of the merged entity. Goenka and his dad, Subhash Chandra, were in June barred by the Securities and Exchange Board of India from being a director or key executive in a publicly traded firm, allegedly for siphoning off company funds. While the father-son duo has denied the charge and an appellate authority has given them reprieve by dismissing the interim order and asking the SEBI to complete its investigation, Sony may not want its presence in an important market to come under a corporate-governance cloud.
If the merger collapses, it’s possible that Zee’s institutional investors will renew their 2021 efforts to boot out the founders, and approach Sony or another strategic partner under a new leadership. But it’s also conceivable that taking advantage of a failed deal, some creditors may succeed in their efforts to push the network into bankruptcy. A three-horse race with Ambani in the lead, followed by a muscular Sony and a limping Zee will be a repeat of India’s telecom story.
None of this may impose a direct, visible cost on consumers. Over time, though, media consolidation may make it more expensive for brands that compete directly with Ambani to get their message heard.

"Reliance Retail to come up with value apparel retail stores in tier 2, 3 towns",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-to-come-up-with-value-apparel-retail-stores-in-tier-2-3-towns/articleshow/105998523.cms,15-12-2023,"Reliance Retail
will come up with value apparel retail stores in tier 2, 3 and below towns under the
Fashion World by Trends
banner in its first major foray into rural and small towns, two industry executives said.
This will also be the first store format which the country’s largest retailer will expand primarily through the franchisee model. The company will set up over 500 such stores in direct competition with the likes of rural and small-town focused chains like
V-Mart Retail
, the executives said.
At present, Reliance Retail has a presence in smaller towns through the existing formats in apparel, grocery, electronics and telecom connectivity, but this is the first time they are setting up a dedicated format for small markets and expand it further into rural areas.
Reliance
has already set up five Fashion World by Trends stores in places like Siliguri, Dhule and Aurangabad. These stores are set up over 5,000 square feet, while its largest apparel retail format, Trends, are set up over 8,000 to 24,000 sq ft.
While Reliance has expanded some of the 2,600-odd Trends stores in smaller towns, the merchandise mix of Fashion World by Trends will be largely different, customized for each market and will have more entry level price options to get first time branded and readymade apparel buyers to the stores, the executives said.

An email sent to Reliance Retail remained unanswered till Thursday press time.
“Reliance will set up 20 Fashion World by Trends stores by this month and over 100 stores in a year. These will be set up mostly in towns where Trends stores are not present. Some cities may have potential for more than one such store,” one of the executives said.
Another executive said less than one lakh population towns will be the core of the expansion of these outlets. “The range will comprise ethnic wear, kids wear, men's and womenswear from national value brands and Reliance owned apparel brands,” he said.
Reliance Retail is the country’s largest apparel retailer with over 4,000 stores across multiple brands. While the Trends brand is the largest fashion retail chain, it has recently launched new formats like Azorte, which is into high street fashion, and youth-centric fashion at Yousta and Centro departmental stores.
One of the executives said this new store format expansion primarily through the franchisee route will help Reliance also expand its business-to-business play in branded apparel. “They can convert existing apparel retailers to become Fashion World by Trends stores and then supply them through the B2B distribution channel,” he said.
Reliance Retail has recently launched more than 50 exclusive apparel brands to be distributed and sold through the B2B channel with plans to increase the number 2-3 times shortly as part of its latest strategy to expand the fashion business through newer vectors such as third-party distribution.

""The market is expected to rebound to 23-25 per cent growth levels, surging beyond USD 160 billion by 2028,"" the statement said.
The e-retail market is poised to grow in the coming years, with online spending currently only 5-6 per cent of total retail spending in India compared to the US where it is 23-24 per cent and 35 per cent in China, indicating massive headroom for growth.
According to the report, the majority of India's retail spend (94-95 per cent) continues to be offline, with general trade accounting for 87 per cent of the overall retail spend.

""As GDP per capita continues to increase, especially beyond USD 4,000, it is expected to drive a sharp rise in online spending, as spend per shopper on discretionary products increases,"" the report said.
At present per capita income is around USD 2,600 in the country.
The report estimates that over 60 per cent internet users are not shopping online. ""The seller ecosystem in India is also expanding rapidly, with twice as many sellers added in 2022 compared to the previous year. Around two-thirds of these new sellers came from Tier 2 and smaller cities,"" the report said.
More than half of the total seller base hails from 7 cities, namely Delhi NCR, Surat, Jaipur, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Kolkata, the report said.
The e-retail industry in India is witnessing the emergence of new business models to cater to consumer needs which include quick-commerce (Q-commerce) platforms, hyper-value commerce, inspiration-led commerce (live commerce), and fast fashion.
""Over the past year, Q-commerce orders have doubled, accounting for 40-50 per cent of India's e-grocery spend,"" Bain & Company, Partner and leading member of the Consumer Products & Retail practice, Shyam Unnikrishnan said.
The hyper-value sector's share of overall e-retail grew five times between 2020 and 2022 in India, the report said.

Pyramid scheme launches climb to highest in 5 years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/pyramid-scheme-launches-climb-to-highest-in-5-years/articleshow/105941748.cms,12-12-2023,"More than 400 new multi-level-marketing pyramid schemes were launched in India in 2023, the highest in five years, according to
Strategy India
, a policy, compliance and
direct-selling consultancy
that's an associate member of the Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA).
Among the names on its scam alert list are entities such as
Mission Green India
, Jivan Daan, Dhan Vriddhi and Capcha Pay. Over 4,000 such schemes are said to be on currently, according to Strategy India. Tracking down the entities listed was difficult as they don't appear to have functional websites or contact addresses where they can be reached.
Operators of such schemes, based on money-circulation networks, pay existing investors with funds collected from new ones instead of doing so from profits. Many remain unchecked by taking advantage of loopholes in existing consumer protection laws. Such entities lure investors by offering unusually high rates of return within short time spans, seeking to recruit from low-income groups. But when new investments stop flowing in, the promoters fold up the venture and vanish with the money. ""To prevent Ponzi and multi-level marketing (MLM) money circulation schemes, the Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules should be revised to remove ambiguity and loopholes,"" said Pranjal Daniel, chief strategist at Strategy India. ""A central committee needs to evaluate and monitor all MLM operations, which is vital to curb complex money circulation schemes with claims to increase investors' wealth through investments in forex trading, cryptocurrencies and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).""
ET Bureau
The Ministry of Consumer Affairs had modified the Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules, 2021, through a notification issued on June 21 this year to distinguish between such fraudulent pyramid and money-circulation schemes and legitimate, direct-selling multi-level marketing players. But executives said further clarity is needed in the definition of a network of sellers. Among the changes, the ministry clarified that the description of ""through a network of sellers"" be substituted with ""directly selling through a network of sellers.""
Live Events
Vivek Katoch, chairman of IDSA, which represents Amway, Oriflame Tupperware, Avon and Herbalife, told ET, ""The Consumer Protection Act needs further clarity, to differentiate between direct selling companies operating with multi-level marketing models, and fraudulent multi-level marketing schemes which operate with the intent of defrauding people from what is commonly referred to as pyramid or Ponzi schemes.""
Legitimate companies offering a variety of products such as daily essentials, vacuum cleaners, cosmetics, air purifiers and storage containers, market their wares to consumers through their direct-seller members and not through retailers.

Reliance Retail scaling up its B2B apparel business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-expanding-b2b-apparel-business/articleshow/105939578.cms,12-12-2023,"After becoming the country's largest apparel retailer,
Reliance Retail
is now scaling up distribution of clothing and fashion products to third-party stores, creating an exclusive portfolio of branded products for this business-to-business venture.
The company has already launched more than 50 such exclusive brands and the number will be increased by 2-3 times shortly as part of its latest strategy to expand the fashion business, going beyond its own stores as that offers much higher growth opportunities, two senior industry executives in the know of the development said.
The brands it has launched so far include
Silkfeet
and
Jivers
in footwear, Xlerate in footwear and athleisure, Feet Up in women’s footwear, Dhuni by Avaasa in Indian wear, Riva in womenswear, John Player Select in menswear, Kidlyboo in kidswear and Altair in t-shirts.
These brands will be distributed by
Reliance
Retail across all markets, including rural, to be sold through third-party stores that are part of its apparel distribution network. The company is running a pilot under the Ajio Business banner, which will be scaled up by next spring-summer, one of the executives said.
“Reliance will launch its own apparel and fashion brands across categories such as western wear, Indian wear, inner wear, lingerie, costume jewellery, footwear, fashion accessories in the value and mid-premium range to be sold through lakhs of third-party retailers. Organising the unorganised will be the next thrust area,” the executive said.

The other executive said the B2B business in apparel will become a bigger revenue generator than Reliance Retail’s own apparel retail stores in five years. He said 80% of the apparel retail market is unorganised in India which is a bigger opportunity to cater than just grow through own stores.
“The textile industry is a large employment generator and Reliance would want to nurture it by ensuring small apparel retailers can offer an assortment. Reliance will create a backend for them so that they can also do sales by showing catalogues,” he said.
An email sent to Reliance Retail seeking comment remained unanswered at press time Tuesday.
Reliance is also distributing other popular apparel and fashion brands through Ajio Business. These include Campus, Khadim’s, Liberty, Biba, Globaldesi, Lotto and Adidas.
Reliance Retail is the country’s largest apparel retailer with over 4,000 stores across multiple brands. Its Trends brand is the largest fashion retail chain with over 2,600 stores. It has recently launched new formats like Azorte which is into high street fashion, youth-centric fashion at Yousta and Centro departmental stores.
“The company will expand the newer formats by 50% annually for next few years, while Trends stores will be expanded by 10-15%. While the overall apparel market is growing at 11%, organised retail is growing at 18-20%,” the second executive said.
Reliance, the country's largest retailer, is also the leader in consumer electronics and mobile phone retailing, and grocery.

by mid next year as it plans to
expand aggressively
to make India among the
top five markets
for the company, Stanley Silverstein, chief commercial officer,

The company has expedited the process of manufacture in India as the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has mandated that all electric and non-electric
toys
bear the ISI mark, and toys without an
ISI mark
are not permitted to be sold in the country.
WHP Global is a brand management firm with a portfolio of consumer brands that generate over 6.5 billion USD in retail sales.

“We will start seeing by mid next year manufactured Toys ‘R’ Us products. Apart from that, most of the assortments here right now, both online and in the stores is coming from a manufacturer from India because of the restrictions,” Chhabra said.
The brand had filed for bankruptcy six years ago, but WHP Global acquired a controlling stake of Toys ‘R’ Us in 2021, following which it started expansion in existing markets and entering new markets.
For the brand, the top five markets include the United States, Japan, China, Italy and Dubai.
“Our expectation with joint venture and the partnership that we created with Flipkart and with ace turtle is to quickly move India to the top three on a global basis, just given the opportunity here,” said Silverstein.
According to Imarc, India’s
toy market
reached a value of $1.5 billion in 2022 and it is projected to reach $3 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 12.2 percent during the forecast period of 2023-2028.
The company will continue to focus on physical retail and is opening a high-street store in Mumbai, which is part of its plan to open 75 stores in next few years.
“We are seeing really explosive growth in physical retail and powerful growth continuing in e-commerce as well,” the executive said.
Supply chain disruptions is the biggest challenge for the company.
“Supply chain has got disrupted because of the BIS regulation and the Indian manufacturing is kind of getting set up. But I think we are still at least about one and a half years away from the state we would like to be, till then there will be some supply constraints on this business,” said Chhabra.
WHP is considering bringing other brands to India to tap the growth of the market.
“We already have a number of the brands in the portfolio that will be trading in India and will be announced shortly. India is a very, very, interesting, and important market and we want to participate in the growth of this market,” said Silverstein.
Toys ‘R’ Us brand generates more than $2 billion in global retail sales annually through 1,400 stores and e-commerce businesses in 31 countries.
Ace turtle recently raised $34 million, or about Rs 293 crore, and it plans to use part of the capital for the expansion of brands under portfolio.

Big discounting makes a comeback with a bang in early end-of-season sale,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/big-discounting-makes-a-comeback-with-a-bang-in-early-end-of-season-sale/articleshow/105870674.cms,10-12-2023,"Kolkata: Big discounting is making a comeback as
brands
and
retailers
including ecommerce platforms are advancing their
end-of-season sale
events by 7-10 days, in a rush to clear unsold inventories and notch-up revenue that remained under pressure for most part of the year.
Some brands said the year-end online discounts in categories like apparel, electronics and mobile phones would be among the highest this year, next only to the festive season deals. Most of the apparel brands have already started offering hefty discounts on their seasonal line-up of winter wear in brick-and-mortar stores, which they usually do towards December-end, they said.
""Even though winter is yet to fully set in even in the North, most brands are not taking chances and have started their end-of-season sales as winters have become short and they want to sell out the merchandise in time,"" said Woodland managing director Harkirat Singh.
Woodland,
Reliance
Trends, Levi's, Ajio,
Flipkart
,
Amazon
,
Myntra
,
Jiomart
and Urban Ladder have started their sale events.
The earlier-than-usual year-end sales come after the festive season turned out to be a mixed bag for brands and retailers. Categories like apparel did not come out of the woods as demand remained soft, except at the premium end.

Smartphones, large-screen televisions and premium appliances did report robust sales, but brands are still left with stock of entry and mass-segment products as consumers with lower discretionary income continued to be cautious with daily

Leading fashion platforms Myntra and Ajio have announced the 'End Of Reason Sale' and 'Big Bold Sale' respectively, offering clothes and other fashion accessories at discounted pricing. For India, the first week of December is well past the festival season, which traditionally begins in October and wraps up by mid-November.
However, companies have continued to offer products at discounted prices via sales, some opting to do it during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The sales are a key indicator of the health of consumption, forming around 60 per cent of India’s gross domestic product. Companies have also been hopeful of tapping into the wedding season, which has only begun in many parts of India, to carry the consumption momentum.
Overall sales between November 23 and December 15 will be about Rs 4.25 lakh crore ($51 billion), the Confederation of All India Traders estimates.

Myntra expects around 10 lakh new customers to shop during the 19th edition of EORS. Ajio's Big Bold Sale, which begins on December 7, saw a 40 per cent spike in orders over business as usual (BAU) during early access to the sale.
Festival season was termed a success by many e-commerce players. ""A very large middle class is expanding as we speak. We are seeing that increasing disposable incomes are leading to customers showing very strong preference to premiumise. This is happening in multiple categories,"" said Saurabh Srivastava, vice president, Amazon India in October, ahead of the shopping season.
Amazon also said that 80 per cent of its customers were from tier 2-3 cities, while claiming that this was the biggest ever 'Great Indian Festival' in the company's history.
“The festive season is expected to be followed by a robust wedding period, both of which combined should support near-term growth,” Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities Pvt, had said late October. “Easy availability of credit and expectations of cooling inflation should also aid a gradual recovery in discretionary spending particularly in the mass market.”
To keep up with the rising demand, companies have been investing in supply chain solutions to ensure timely deliveries.
As per Zebra Technologies 2023 Global Warehousing Study, around 75 per cent of the warehouse
decision-makers in India and other Asia Pacific (APAC) markets face pressure to improve
performance due to evolving e-commerce demands.
The study further stated that 58% of warehouse decision-makers plan to deploy next-generation technologies like radio frequency identification (RFID) by 2028, which enables real-time inventory visibility and reduces out-of-stocks which becomes really critical during high demand season like the festivities in India.
""The Indian retail industry is undergoing a huge shift towards digital technologies with the preference for omni-channel experience by the modern shopper who is looking for a seamless e-commerce digital journey whilst enjoying personalized experiences in stores,"" said Rajnish Gupta, VP and Head - India & Subcontinent Business, Zebra Technologies.
""This has put huge pressure on retailers, especially during the festive season to improve supply chain and demand forecasting to reduce out-of-stock items, shrinkage, better returns management, and increased collaboration with instore associates and personalization,"" he added.

Netflix collaborates with close to a dozen large brands for The Archies; borrows leaf from The Barbie,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/netflix-india-collaborates-with-major-brands-for-the-archies/articleshow/105763665.cms,06-12-2023,"Netflix
India has partnered with nearly a dozen large brands for The
Archies
movie, which releases on December 7, making it among the largest number of brand marketing collaborations for an over-the-top (OTT) film in India so far, said industry executives.
Cosmetics maker
Maybelline
, cafe chain
Starbucks
, e-commerce platform Flipkart, consumer electronics brand
BoAt
,
Vistara
airline,
VIP Skybags
and
Bombay Sweet Shop
are among companies that have launched limited edition products or services to recreate the Riverdable vibe in the Zoya Akhtar-directed movie and cash on its pre-release hype.
Shilpa Singh, senior director, marketing partnerships, APAC, Netflix, said: “By partnering with brands like Starbucks, Vistara, Maybelline, Skybags, and boAt, our aim is to marry the iconic elements from The Archies and the 60s era with brands of today.” She said the OTT platform is looking “beyond just showcasing”.
Executives said the partnerships reflect the coming of age for OTT-brand tie-ups in India and borrows from The Barbie movie’s $150 million global marketing blitz.
“After the success of global franchises like Barbie in India, we have Archies which is equally high on aspiration. In India, brands have had very few opportunities to leverage this pre-teen and teen genre,” said
Priya
Goradia, chief operating officer at marketing company D'Artist Talent Ventures, which has worked on
Dabur
and Club Mahindra.

Flipkart has introduced an Archies line of dresses, footwear and accessories under its Gen Z-focused fashion platform Spoyl, VIP Skybags has launched an Archies Backpack collection, Starbucks is selling Holiday Classics drinks like Veronica’s toffee nut crunch frappuccino and Jughead’s Gingerbread frappuccino, and Maybelline has introduced retro makeup.
The Archies movie, made on an estimated budget of Rs 40 crore, is based on the American comic book series by the same name.
Flipkart termed the association with Netflix as “a first-of-its kind”. Flipkart Fashion’s senior director Abhishek Maloo said: “The Archies collection, a collaboration between fashion and entertainment, is the start of a new journey for Spoyl.”
Announcing the association with Skybags,
VIP Industries
wrote on its Instagram page: “You’ve seen what’s in the bag. Now it’s time to see what’s in The Archies’ pack.”
Maybelline, on the other hand, has launched a limited edition retro make-up line.
Hunger Inc. Hospitality-owned premium sweet and snacking brand Bombay Sweet Shop’s has introduced Riverdale hampers comprising Archies peppermint barks and Betty’s choco plum cake balls.
While in-movie placements and collaborations have been done frequently, it hasn’t been the case for OTT platforms in India, where brand associations have so far been limited.
Goradia said branded content through an OTT film like The Archies would resonate with young consumers since the target group of the movie predominantly operates and consumes digital content.
Previously, Alia Bhatt-starrer Darlings, which was released on Netflix in mid-2022, saw in-product placements for brands such as Daawat basmati rice, Veeba ketchup, Eva deodorants, Parle’s Frooti and Amul.
According to a report by Media Partners Asia (MPA), India’s streaming OTT video market generated revenues of $3 billion in 2022, which is expected to more than double to almost $7 billion by 2027.

Government to set up subsidised staple food stores at Delhi Metro Stations,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/government-to-set-up-subsidised-staple-food-stores-at-delhi-metro-stations/articleshow/105762869.cms,05-12-2023,"The central government will make available kitchen essentials such as onion, pulses and atta at subsidised prices to consumers by opening retail stores at major metro stations in the national capital this month, a senior government official said.
If the project is successful, it plans to extend it to other cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru which have metro rail networks, the official said.
Elevated prices of food essentials - wheat, rice, pulses, sugar, onions - is a major concern for the union government, which will face voters in the general elections in April-May 2024.
The first store will be opened at Central Delhi's Rajiv Chowk metro station, to tap into the high footfall it receives. It will be owned and operated by National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India Ltd (
NCCF
) - an organisation that procures agricultural commodities like food grains, pulses, spices, oil seeds, pharmaceutical items and other consumer goods on behalf of the government and sells to consumers at reasonable rates.
NCCF is looking to open 15-20 stores at metro stations in Delhi. Currently, it runs mobile vans across cities to sell subsidised food items. But this programme has limited reach.
Live Events
Driven by uneven and scanty rains, retail inflation was at a 15-month high of 7.44% in July, with food price inflation accelerating to 11.5% - the highest in more than three and a half years.
Food inflation
, which accounts for nearly half the overall consumer price basket, has since slowed amid government's efforts such as prohibiting export of wheat; restricting shipments of sugar, onion and rice; importing pulses; and selling wheat, rice, and vegetables such as onions from its own stocks. But it still remained high at 6.61% in October.
By opening these stores in metro stations, the government intends to reach out to a larger number of consumers and help them avail of the subsidies it is giving out, said the official.
""This is a part of a pilot that NCCF is doing together with the
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation
,"" said the official, adding that, if successful, this will be replicated in other major cities which have the metro rail.

Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) recently asked the independent directors of Raymond to consider appointing an interim CEO and investigate the allegations of assault by Singhania on his wife and daughter, and the use of company funds for personal benefit.
In an open letter to the company's five independent directors, IiAS also suggested they ask Singhania and his estranged wife Nawaz Modi, also a board member, to take time off from their responsibilities as board members. IiAS said Modi has alleged that she and her daughter were physically assaulted by Singhania in September 2023. She also alleged that company funds were being used for Singhania's personal benefit (CEO excesses) -- and that she was acting as a whistle-blower of sorts.
Late November, Singhania assured employees and board members that it is ""business as usual"" in the company and that he is fully committed to its smooth functioning.
In an internal mail to the employees and the board members of Raymond, Singhania, who announced separation from his wife Nawaz earlier this month, said he has chosen not to comment on the reports in media ""about matters pertaining to my personal life"", saying ""maintaining the dignity of my family is paramount to me"".
""However, I remain resolute as Chairman & Managing Director and am fully committed towards the smooth functioning of the company and its business. Even in these difficult times for me, I assure you that at Raymond, it is business as usual,"" he asserted in his mail.

Luxury inc sees India as the next big destination,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/luxury-inc-sees-india-as-the-next-big-destination/articleshow/105602446.cms,30-11-2023,"India matters, and all over the world,
luxury brands
are looking at India, says Bénédicte Epinay, CEO of Comité Colbert, the official luxury association of France that represents 93 luxury brands and behemoths such as
LVMH
,
Chanel
and
Kering
.
“Is India the next promising market? There are obstacles such as custom duties and the bureaucracy, but it probably is, because you have all the ingredients,” Epinay told ET. “You have the consumers, you have the appetite for refinement, you have the taste to understand luxury, and you have the passion to show off.”
She was here for the first
Indo-French luxury symposium
, or ‘IFCCI Luxury Symposium’, held in New Delhi on Wednesday.
“Post Covid, we are back to a new normal. Brands are seeing a growth of about 5-10% globally, which is why a lot of them are banking on India for their future growth prospects,” Epinay said.
From Gucci’s India specific launches at the Jio World Plaza mall and its signing up of Bollywood star Alia Bhatt as the first Indian global ambassador to the Gateway of India becoming a Dior runway this year, India is the place to be for global luxury brands and the next key frontier, industry insiders say.
Live Events
“Sales of luxury brands have grown in double digits this year for us compared to last year,” said Pushpa Bector, senior executive director at DLF Retail. “We want more luxury brands to come to India. The good part is millennials have started shopping for luxury. It’s an evolved customer that we are seeing today and the time for luxury has come in this country,” she added.
But, challenges around regulations and custom duties remain.
The Indian market might not be the easiest to access, but India is definitely the place to be, Thierry Mathou, ambassador of France to India, said at the IFCCI Luxury Symposium.
“We are living in the moment of India. What is true for technology, defence, and many other sectors is also true for luxury. Brands such as Dior, LVMH, Hermes, Cartier and Chanel have launched initiatives with India as a focus,” he said.
“India is ready, as shown by the recent opening of the Jio mall in Mumbai. That was a remarkable milestone that the entire industry has acknowledged,” Mathou added.
Uzma Irfan, corporate communications director at Prestige Group, which operates UB City Mall in Bengaluru, said more brands are coming into the country. She also manages operations and leasing for the mall.
Bulgari launched the Mangalsutra for Indian consumers, while Jimmy Choo had a Diwali capsule collection promoted through a campaign featuring Bollywood actress Ananya Pandey this year.
Abhay Gupta, founder and CEO of Luxury Connect, a firm that offers services on strategy, advisory, sourcing and skilling to luxury brands, said the momentum for luxury consumption has picked up “dramatically”.
“Earlier, luxury brands did not trust Indians so much with their management skills,” he said. If we talk of a sector like auto, 15 years ago, the luxury auto brands were managed by expats. Today, they are all Indians... Audi is headed by Balbir Dhillon while Sharad Agarwal is the head of Lamborghini in India. Leena Nair was appointed as the global head of Chanel.”
Gupta also pointed to the Indian diaspora across the world. “Why are they (luxury brands) also picking Indian brand ambassadors? Because we have the largest population worldwide, the largest diaspora worldwide, and the largest Gen Z and millennials worldwide,” he said.

"Walmart shifts to India, cuts China imports",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/walmart-shifts-to-india-from-china-for-cheaper-imports/articleshow/105595410.cms,30-11-2023,"Walmart
is importing more goods to the United States from
India
and reducing its reliance upon
China
as it looks to cut costs and diversify its supply chain, data seen by Reuters shows.
The world's largest retailer shipped one quarter of its U.S. imports from India between January and August this year, according to bill of lading figures shared with Reuters by data firm Import Yeti. That compared with just 2% in 2018.
The data shows that only 60% of its shipments came from China during the same period, down from 80% in 2018. To be sure, China is still Walmart's biggest country for importing goods.
The shift illustrates how the rising cost of importing from China and escalating political tensions between Washington and Beijing are encouraging large U.S. companies to import more from countries including India, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the U.S., shoppers face higher interest rates and high food prices, eroding household savings and prompting Walmart and other retailers to become cautious in their outlook for consumer spending.

""We want the best prices,"" Andrea Albright, Walmart's executive vice president of sourcing said in an interview. ""That means I need resiliency in our supply chains. I can't be reliant on any one supplier or geography for my product because we're constantly managing things from hurricanes and earthquakes to shortages in raw materials.""
In a statement, Walmart said the bill of lading data painted a partial picture of what it sourced and that creating redundancy ""does not necessarily mean"" it was reducing reliance on any of its sourcing markets. ""We're a growth business and are working to source more manufacturing capacity,"" Walmart said.
India has emerged as a key component of Walmart's efforts to build that manufacturing capacity, Albright said.
Walmart has been accelerating growth in India since 2018, when it bought a 77% stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart. Two years later, it committed to import $10 billion of goods from India each year by 2027. That is a target it remains on track to hit, Albright said. It is currently importing around $3 billion worth of goods from India each year.
WORKFORCE, TECHNOLOGY ARE KEY DRAWS
Walmart is importing goods ranging from toys and electronics to bicycles and pharmaceuticals from India to the U.S., Albright said. Packaged food, dry grains and pasta are also popular imports from India, she added.
India, whose stock market has risen to record highs this year, is viewed as the country best equipped to outperform China in low-cost, large-scale manufacturing.
Its rapidly growing workforce and technological advancement were a draw for Walmart, Albright said. China on the other hand reported its first decline in population in six decades last year.
Walmart started its sourcing operations in Bangalore in 2002. Now, the company employs more than 100,000 people, including temporary workers, in the country spread across several offices under its Walmart Global Tech India unit, Flipkart Group, PhonePe and sourcing operations.
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon met Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
in May this year, a meeting that Modi termed ""a fruitful one.""
""Happy to see India emerge as an attractive destination for investment,"" Modi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on May 14. McMillon said Walmart would ""continue to support the country's manufacturing growth and create opportunity.""
Walmart rival Amazon said this month it is targeting merchandise exports worth $20 billion from India by 2025.
Freewill Sports, a small Indian supplier of soccer balls, is one company that has benefited, its Chief Executive Rajesh Kharabanda said in an interview.
The rising cost of shipping goods from China has also contributed to the switch to India, supply chain experts say.
""Sourcing from mainland China has become less competitive because of rising labor costs versus other manufacturing centers,"" said Chris Rogers, research analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence's supply chain analysis group Panjiva.
China's minimum wage changes from province to province and sometimes even from city to city, with a range between 1,420 yuan per month and 2,690 yuan per month ($198.52 - $376.08). Meanwhile, average wages for unskilled and semi-skilled workers in India range from about 9,000 Indian rupees to 15,000 Indian rupees a month ($108.04 - $180.06), according to central
bank
estimates.
SUPPLY CHAIN SNAGS
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in global supply chains, showing U.S. importers to be over-reliant on a small number of markets.
""Planning for a geopolitical event is like planning for a hurricane,"" said Albright. ""What I can control is where my product is coming from and how do I make sure that Christmas still happens if something happens in our supply chain.""
Pakistan and Bangladesh have also benefited from Walmart's strategy, expanding as suppliers of home and apparel products, Albright said.
Last year, at least eight Freewill shipments sailed to Walmart warehouses from Mundra Port in Gujarat, the largest private port in India, according to U.S. import data.
""There is a newfound confidence in the Indian manufacturing industry and also the availability of factory infrastructure,"" Freewill's Chief Executive Rajesh Kharabanda said in an interview.
India's central bank forecasts that the country's economy will expand 6.5% this
fiscal year
. China is expected to grow around 5% this year.
""In the last 12 to 18 months there has certainly been a bigger impact,"" said Shekhar Gupta, whose family business Devgiri has been selling floor rugs to Walmart for about a decade. ""That's when Walmart started putting a true strategy behind how they wanted India at the center of their growth.""

Reliance Retail and Naturals Salon call off deal talks,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-and-naturals-salon-call-off-deal-talks/articleshow/105571900.cms,28-11-2023,"Reliance Retail
and Naturals Salon & Spa have called off their acquisition talks on differences in valuation of the latter, executives aware of the development said.
Reliance
Retail
had been in advanced negotiations with Groom India Salons & Spa, which owns Naturals, to acquire 49% stake in the salon chain in a deal that would have marked Reliance's entry in the fast-growing salon business and given Naturals' bandwidth and backing of the conglomerate to rapidly scale up amid increased competition in the sector.
""It was mutually agreed to withdraw from the transaction due to potential synergy mismatches and other preferences,"" Naturals Salon & Spa chief executive CK Kumaravel confirmed to ET.
With close to 700 outlets across India, Naturals Salon & Spa is among India's top five national salon chains, besides Hindustan Unilever's Lakme Lever, stylist Jawed Habib's salon chain and Studio11. Each of these have announced expansion plans in recent months, including into tier-2 and -3 markets.
""Naturals is presently well poised with plans of expansion into multiple verticals and extended businesses. The salon is going global and the company will plan to tap the capital markets for its growth plans at an appropriate time,"" Kumaravel said.

Retailers are opening bigger physical retail stores to fulfill consumers' need for better experience,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-are-opening-bigger-physical-retail-stores-to-fulfill-consumers-need-for-better-experience/articleshow/105565528.cms,28-11-2023,"Retailers
across categories are opening bigger bricks-and-mortar stores along with expanding their existing stores as consumers are increasingly looking for a better experience in
physical retail
. According to Anarock data, the share of stores smaller than 2,000 square feet declined to 52% in the first half of 2023-24, as against 61% a year ago.
The share of stores sized 2,000-5,000 sq ft increased during this period, to 21% from 19%, as did that of those sized 5,000-10,000 sq ft (11% from 9%) and 10,000-15,000 sq ft (13% from 9%).
Real estate services firm Anarock said retailers across categories are adopting a two-pronged approach by expanding and entering newer markets and also increasing their store sizes to capitalize on the growing share of the
organised retail market
.
“Store is now more about experience than merchandising. Brands have realised that and they by expanding the store they are expanding the offering,” said Pankaj Renjhen, COO and joint MD, Anarock Retail.
The market share of organised retail market in
India
is growing at a rapid pace with sales & footfalls reaching an all-time high.
Live Events
“Today, shopping is more than just a mere transaction; consumers expect an overall pleasant buying experience. Ample in-store space allows for a wider selection of products and fosters an inviting atmosphere that elevates the shopping experience to newer heights,” said Tushar Ved, President of Apparel Group India Pvt Ltd which sells brands such as Aldo, Canadian lingerie and sleepwear brand, la Vie en Rose, Charles & Keith and Bath & Body Works in India.
Some retailers have increased the average store size by 30-40% while a few doubled it, despite rising rentals, said mall operators.
“Physical retail has undergone a significant change post-Covid and malls have to adjust accordingly. While expanding at an existing mall becomes difficult, on request of brands we have adjusted some of them. At our new mall, they are asking for a bigger area as store design has also changed,” said Harsh V Bansal, co-founder of Unity group which operates about half a dozen malls in Delhi and Punjab.
Retailers in India leased nearly 4.73 million sq ft of space across top cities in the first nine months of 2023, marking a strong rebound from the pandemic-induced slowdown. Leasing activity during the period was higher than the entire 2022, showed data from CBRE.
“We believe that larger-format stores offer the best experience for customers, by allowing us to showcase our full lineup. Larger stores allow us to weave a narrative, wherein we can invite customers to spend time exploring,” said
UNIQLO
India spokesperson.
While companies including
Reliance Retail
, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, D'Mart, Tata group’s Trent, Shoppers Stop, Lifestyle and
Starbucks
continued to add stores, others such as Uniqlo, Latin Quarters, Meena Bazaar, Lee and Wrangler started expanding bricks-and-mortar stores.
“Unlike a one-size-fits-all approach towards sizing, we prioritize a balanced approach which is strategically driven by a thorough analysis of customer profile, demand in each city, economic viability and most importantly revenue per square feet. This key metric is used for the identification of the right size of the store to ensure that each store creates an environment that resonates with our customers as well as contributes to the overall success of our retail model,” said Pankaj Gupta, Head-
Retail Operations
, Bata India.
According to CBRE, retail sector leasing increased 46% year-on-year in the January-September period. Total absorption in the country’s top eight cities increased to 4.73 million sq ft from 3.23 million sq ft a year ago.
Fashion and apparel, and home and department stores dominated leasing activity with more than 50% share. Bengaluru, Delhi-National Capital Region and Pune collectively accounted for more than 61% share during this period. Supply of fresh retail space soared 577% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2023 to about 2.98 million sq ft.
Bigger stores mean higher rentals for retailers and they need more footfall to increase the revenue. However, the conversion rate matters more than footfall, according to retailers.
After the Covid-19-induced lockdown, retailers had started shutting stores or reducing the size of stores to save on rentals. The trend reversed with the return of shoppers to the malls and markets.

"Beauty, lifestyle, electronics top-selling categories this Diwali: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/beauty-lifestyle-electronics-top-selling-categories-this-diwali-report/articleshow/105561635.cms,29-11-2023,"Beauty products saw a surge of 51.5% year-on-year in sales in India this Diwali, global e-commerce accelerator for D2C brands Assiduus Global Inc said in a report on Tuesday.

festive shopping
season. Mobile phones, adaptors, and earpods were the top-selling products in the electronics category with brands like
Redmi

OnePlus
and Boat taking the lead, according to the report.
The report noted that 47% sales of beauty products were contributed by consumers in the 18-24 year age group.
The report further flagged healthcare and nutrition as categories with greater awareness and demand, underscoring the competition among brands vying for limited space within marketplaces.
Somdutta Singh, founder and chief executive at Assiduus Global Inc, said in a statement: “Embracing online shopping as the new norm, the Indian e-commerce sector is poised for remarkable expansion.” She said the surge was led by Gen Z and millennial consumers, indicating that the digitally savvy generation is dominating the online shopping space in India. “We have also seen an exponential rise in sales from tier 2 and 3 cities in India. The increased engagement of younger generations and the rising interest from smaller cities are pivotal indicators of broadening acceptance and accessibility of online shopping across diverse demographics and geographies,"" Singh said in the statement.

What does sales as a service mean? How it works for consumer goods companies?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/what-does-sales-as-a-service-mean-how-it-works-for-consumer-goods-companies/articleshow/105487876.cms,25-11-2023,"The Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (
FMCG
) companies, have always found it challenging to reach Indian rural markets. The potential of this market, constituting >70% of India’s retail landscape, has remained largely untapped, primarily due to challenges in rural distribution. Due to the saturation of the urban markets, companies are adapting go-to-market strategies to meet their continuous growth ambitions. This is where
Sales-as-a-Service
(SaaS) emerges as a game-changing solution that can help overcome the limitations of traditional distribution models and achieve remarkable risk-free market expansion.
Challenges in Unorganized Retail Distribution
Customers choose convenience over brand loyalty. So, to protect sales, companies want to maintain a full product range at every relevant outlet (numeric distribution). However, this is frequently compromised due to fears about cost and control. Companies tend to experience diminishing returns for their cost of servicing, i.e., as shops get smaller, the order value per sales visit decreases, and the number of shops declines with increased distances. Concurrently, as the sales force expands, its management becomes more challenging. Even though companies endeavor to continuously expand their physical market presence and make their complete product portfolio readily accessible to consumers, they face the harsh reality of reaching only a fraction of their intended market, even after years of operations.
A typical distribution system faces multiple challenges like significant gap between the number of mapped and serviced retailers, the number of active retailers, the total range sold (secondary) stagnates, field force facing a constant conflict of
Value Target
v/s Reach & Range Expansion, and finally absenteeism or attrition leading to “Drops”
Sunil Davis Kolangaden, Co-Founder and CEO of Prowess Selling Skills (PSSPL) shares, “In order to address these challenges in the Indian FMCG industry needs some out-of-the-box thinking. And one of the solutions is to go for Sales-as-a-Service (SaaS). Under this model, the service provider delivers on-ground sales executives, retailer databases, comprehensive software suites, dedicated apps, and complete support (including retail finance) required to undertake market expansion activities in a chosen region/market. In addition to increasing the company’s market reach, the provider’s ability to integrate technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence enables superior service to targeted retailers.”
Sales as a Service
is a comprehensive solution that transcends traditional sales models. It involves outsourcing the sales function to a specialized service provider, enabling companies to focus on their core competencies while leveraging the expertise of sales professionals.

Though the adoption of SaaS may seem daunting for companies, but it offers a risk-free solution to acquire new markets because there is no interruption in current sales operations, mitigating the fear of disruption. No additional CAPEX is required and the cost per sale under this model may be the same or lower compared to the traditional approach.
As the consumer goods industry continues evolving and easier-to-serve markets saturate, embracing Sales-as-a-Service may be the key to increasing market share and growth.

Shashwat Goenka
said the group is confident of turning profitable its consumer business comprising
retail stores
such as
Spencer's Retail
,

The financial turnaround will be achieved by reducing debt through a mix of restructuring and repayment of loans, exiting loss-making stores and categories, and entering a new high margin retail format through world-class
luxury gourmet stores
, said Goenka in an interview.
The group, meanwhile, continues to hold talks to sell a minority stake in Spencer's Retail and plans to list the FMCG business at the “right time”, said Goenka. He didn’t elaborate.
The new luxury retail format-- Nature’s Basket Artisan Pantry--will be housed under Nature’s Basket, and it will offer luxury gourmet food products with several first of its kind products in the Indian market and higher share of imported products. These stores, set up over 8,000-12,000 square feet as compared to the usual 2,000-3,000 sq ft for Nature’s Basket, will not only generate more revenues but add 1-2 percentage points to gross margins.

The first Nature’s Basket Artisan Pantry store will open this weekend in Mumbai’s Palladium Mall, Goenka said. He said a second store will open in Mumbai while Kolkata will get its first store by next month, and 3-5 stores next fiscal including in the National Capital Region and Bengaluru. “These stores are globally comparable only with Harrods Food Halls in London. These stores will breakeven in 2-3 months of their starting operations and contribute much higher to the topline,” he said.
Last quarter, the group closed 22 highly loss-making stores of Spencer’s, leading to an exit from Tamil Nadu and Kerala. There are currently 135 Spencer’s and 32 Nature’s Basket stores.
Nature’s Basket had been carrying debt of around Rs 100 crore when the group acquired the business from Godrej in 2019, impacting its profits.
“We should make Nature’s Basket net profitable next fiscal. We can do a combination of
loan restructuring
and payment which will be decided by the board in the future. The business is growing at a double-digit pace quarter-on-quarter,” said Goenka.
The Nature’s Basket standalone business narrowed its net loss to Rs 25 crore in the first half of this financial year from Rs 30 crore a year earlier.
However, Spencer’s standalone business nearly doubled net loss to Rs 108 crore in the same period this fiscal from Rs 57 crore last fiscal. Goenka said Spencer's business will take 2-3 years to start generating net profit though it is likely exit this financial year with positive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda).
The FMCG business – run by
Guiltfree Industries
– had posted sales of Rs 423 crore last fiscal, growing by 22% year-on-year with a net loss of Rs 336 crore, which swelled from Rs 236 crore in FY22. Goenka said the FMCG business is currently in the scaling-up stage and will take at least three years to start making net profits.
He also said its ‘Too Yumm’ packaged snacks brand is growing at 50-60%, while it has just relaunched the personal care business in direct-to-consumer mode selling online to test the market, and will accordingly decide on whether to scale it up.

Black Friday sales: Desi fervour for a Western phenomenon a boost for Indian retailers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/black-friday-sales-desi-fervour-for-a-western-phenomenon-a-boost-for-indian-retailers/articleshow/105469182.cms,24-11-2023,"A case of cultural appropriation at its best, companies of late have found a new way to attract Indian consumers in a bid to boost sales: Black Friday. Predominantly a Western phenomenon, brands through
Black Friday sales
provide hefty discounts on a variety of products.
As for Indians, it is a great opportunity for those who missed the
Diwali sales
bus.
An increasing number of brands are jumping on the bandwagon, seeking to tap into an Indian populace that finds itself more connected with Western culture. However, more than anything, it is just another opportunity sandwiched between Diwali and Christmas spirit that typically takes consumer item sales to new highs.
This year it also comes at a time when Indians at large are riding the premium wave and are ready to shell out a lakh of rupees for a mobile or TV.
“Black Friday is becoming a global phenomenon for giving a chance for consumers to buy aspirational products at good deal pricing. This also helps retailers get a better stock turn at reduced margins,” Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of the Retailers Association of
India
(RAI) told ET Online.
Live Events
Offers are up for grabs on products ranging from clothing, footwear, beauty & personal care to consumer electronics, appliances and jewellery with players like Amazon,
Myntra
,
Croma
and
Vijay Sales
catering to the rise in demand.
“Many lifestyle products including consumer durables, IT products, garments and wearable accessories seem to be getting a sales boost. Generally, this is seen as being very useful for omnichannel retailers,” Rajagopalan added.
Western phenomenon, Desi opportunity
Unlike in India, which is currently nearing the end of its festive season,
Black Friday
marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping season in the US and Europe. This is followed by Cyber Monday, which is typically the busiest shopping season in the US.
For Indians, it is a chance for those who missed out on the bulky discounts during Diwali sales, which usually begin in October.
Despite the US accounting for the largest revenue share of the global Black Friday sale market, India is the next big thing. As per Future Markets Insights, India has the highest growth potential among other markets and is predicted to witness a CAGR of 37.4 per cent by 2032, a report by FMI shows.
It is a chance to catch-up, not only for the consumers, but also for the retailers.
“While the Diwali season remains pivotal for us in the Indian market, Black Friday is gaining traction as a platform for manufacturers and retailers to dispose excess inventory accumulated during Diwali,” Rahul Mehta, chief mentor, Clothing Manufacturers Association of India, told ET Online.
The thrust on Black Friday sales is largely being pushed through e-commerce, with companies witnessing higher traffic. Businesses are taking steps to meet heightened consumer demand, with particular emphasis on e-commerce and retail, Yeshab Giri, chief commercial officer, of staffing and Randstad Technologies at Randstad India told ET.
Executives tell ET that this demand isn’t restricted to urban regions, with demand expected in tier- II & III markets as well.
Festive demand momentum
Retailers in India are still riding the shopping boom.
""This year, festive sales are not confined to just one day... the industry is having good sales right from Navratra,"" news agency PTI quoted Eric Braganza, President of the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association as saying.
e-Commerce companies and online brands saw a steady uptick in sales with categories like electronics, food, grocery, and jewellery reporting double-digit growth over last year.
Order volumes for e-commerce grew around 37 per cent on an annual basis during the festive season in 2023, data from Unicommerce showed.
Companies and retailers across India are offering discounts of up to 50 per cent as they feel Diwali demand momentum has more legroom.
The beginning of the wedding season is providing additional momentum to Black Friday sales.
""The purpose of purchasing during Diwali differs significantly from that of Black Friday, with the former exerting a more substantial impact on sales. In the current trends, the focus is predominantly on ethnic wear, influenced by the ongoing wedding season and the demand for winter clothing,” CMAI’s Mehta said.
The festive season sales form an important reading of the Indian economy as it is a key indicator of health of consumption in the country. Consumption forms around 60 per cent of India's gross domestic product. Ahead of the festive season, economists saw some easing in inflation and pick-up in wages, especially in the rural areas of India.

Staffing firms said the demand surge for seasonal gig workforce has gone up significantly over last year.
Yeshab Giri, chief commercial officer, staffing and Randstad Technologies at Randstad India said businesses are strategically gearing up to meet heightened consumer demand during Black Friday, with particular emphasis on e-commerce and retail. “We anticipate that hiring of gig workers will increase by around 15-20%, with a focus on essential roles such as store associates, sales associates, retail staff, and cashiers.”
Apart from rising disposable incomes, higher internet penetration, and e-commerce proliferation, social media is also driving traction for such events, executives said.
CIEL HR Services chief executive Aditya Mishra said Black Friday, typically a huge event in the United States, has been gaining traction in India over the last two years, with companies ramping up their teams in preparation for the Black Friday rush. “Demand for skilled professionals is witnessing a remarkable 20% rise compared to September. And if we look at last year's figures, the demand has escalated by roughly 10%.” He said marketing services, retail sales, operations, warehouse assistants and customer relationship officers are in high demand.
The concept, despite not being Indian, has steeped down even to India’s smaller markets, executives said.
Harmeet Singh, vice-president, marketing, product and digital at beauty products maker The Body Shop Asia South, said the company has redone some of its retail stores into “workshop” spaces which include gifting stations, even in tier 2 and 3 cities, to recruit more consumers to buy premium products at discounts for Black Friday. “During the Black Friday sale, our retail stores experience an incredible influx of customers… we anticipate another surge in demand.”
According to Manu Saigal, director, general staffing at Adecco said, it’s India's growing affinity for Black Friday sales that is driving an uptick in hiring, particularly in e-commerce and logistics sectors. “We estimate that around 15,000 jobs will be created this time. Black Friday has become a rising retail phenomenon in India, and this is translating into increased demand for seasonal hiring,” Saigal said. He added the seasonal hiring trend would continue in the coming years, solidifying the event's impact on job growth.
The demand surge follows a robust Diwali season for India, which saw categories such as mobile phones, beauty and fashion, reporting robust demand, specially for premium categories.

"What's behind the glitter of Titan, and where it is headed",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/whats-behind-the-glitter-of-titan-and-where-it-is-headed/articleshow/105412103.cms,22-11-2023,"Often called India's Warren Buffett, ace stock market investor
Rakesh Jhunjhunwala
, who died in August last year, had more than three dozen companies in his portfolio. He was described as an investor who had a Midas touch. The stock that exemplified his Midas touch the most was watch and jewellery maker Titan, part of the Tata conglomerate. Acquisition of
Titan
Ltd. shares was among his most profitable investments.
Jhunjhunwala placed his bets in early 2000s on the Tata Group firm that predominantly made watches and was struggling with labour issues. When he passed away last year, the stock had surged more than 26,000% since the start of 2005. Now, Jhunjhunwala's wife holds nearly 5.1% stock in Titan, which has become India’s biggest jewellery firm.
Titan on Tuesday crossed ₹3 lakh crore in market value. It became only the second company from the Tata Group to cross a valuation threshold earlier breached by Tata Consultancy Services (
TCS
). Titan is also the second company in the retail sector, after DMart's parent Avenue Supermart, to surpass this benchmark.
What's behind Titan's glitter?
Titan, a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation, is active in several businesses such as jewellery, eye care, fragrances and fashion accessories with brands that include Tanishq, Mia, Zoya, Fastrack, Sonata, Eyeplus, Taneira, Skinn and Caratlane. The jewellery division accounts for nearly 90% of its revenue.
Live Events
Titan Company
's MD CK Venkataraman had said that Jhunjhunwala's reason for staying invested in Titan was the fundamentals of the
Tata company
, which continue to be strong. However, a sharp-eyed Jhunjhunwala must have noticed the real secret behind Titan's success: a rising Bharat.
Titan, which reinvented itself from a watch brand to a jewellery brand, straddles two different narratives, the traditional and the contemporary, both converging in the recent rise of India which now aims to become the third-largest economy of the world.
Firstly, by getting into the gold business, Titan plunged itself into a sector where demand rarely slackens for long, supported as it is by numerous festivals that occur all through the year in India as well as the famous big fat Indian wedding when people splurge on gold. Both these factors keep the gold demand up in the country. What worked for Titan was its creation of a credible brand, Tanishq, in a sector which has been largely informal. Titan found a veritable goldmine in the jewellery sector by riding on the trust that a Tata brand evokes.
Secondly, Titan was able to establish a premium jewellery brand in Tanishq just when the premiumisation trend started in India's consumer market a few years ago. Premiumisation was accompanied by a sister trend, the rise of Bharat, the sudden manifestation of huge appetite for premium products in small towns of India where people had conventionally pinched pennies.
""Smallest of towns are witnessing booming business,"" Venkataraman had told ET last year. ""There is a fair amount of money in small towns and the number of choices in small towns is less, unlike in the big cities where you spend money on going to restaurants. All that money is available to buy things. We are betting big on Bharat, even though we are betting big on India."" Currently, 60 percent of the company's workforce is based in the metros and sizable 40 percent in tier II and III cities.
Inflation, the bane of retailers in India, and the tough issue of pricing, do not affect Titan's premium and luxury business as much as they impact other retailers. Venkataraman had told ET that the customer base of Titan is the top half of the income pyramid of the country, and in that segment inflation has little role to play. There has also been a negligible impact on pricing of Titan's product.
Titan caters to customers who are sitting at the top of the income pyramid and who are typically called the aspirers, the affluent and the elite. ""Our business is entirely dependent on these segments and therefore our ability to extract higher and higher prices through a much more exquisite necklace or a much more stunning watch or a much more stylish frame and much higher quality lens continues,"" Venkataraman had said.
Fluctuating gold prices do not result in sharp swings for Titan. ""What happens is that the commodity prices are passed through in the sense that the store of value keeps increasing,"" Venkatraman said. ""Also, as the price of gold rises, the rate at which consumers can exchange their gold with the brands they buy from rises. So inflation is not really the same in gold as it is in every other category. So that is not an issue.""
In nutshell, Titan brought the power of a prestigious brand to an informal sector where demand exploded due to growing consumer appetite for premium products, especially in small towns, where a brand like Tanishq evokes trust in a business that has always run on trust.
What the future holds for Titan
Titan's optimism stems from the fact that India is among the fastest-growing luxury markets globally and is forecast to be around $8.5 billion this year, and some estimates say it will grow to $200 billion by 2030. With the number of HNIs growing very fast, it expects the demand for its luxury business such as Zoya to grow.
The overall competitive intensity in the jewellery business has increased in the last three to five years but what is also simultaneously happening is that the total share of the organised sector within the jewellery industry is dramatically increasing. ""In every city, in every town, people are wanting to buy brands. Some of them will end up buying brands, which are our competitors, some of them will end up buying Tanishq. Therefore, the overall opportunity for the branded segment is exploding and we cannot at all underestimate the power of the Tanishq brand,"" said Venkatraman.
Titan is on a growth binge, adding stores at a breathless pace as well as hiring big. The company on Tuesday said it is planning to add more than 3,000 employees in the next five years across domains including engineering, design, luxury, digital, data analytics, marketing and sales among others.
Titan says it is embarking on an exciting journey towards becoming a Rs 1,00,000 crore business in the next five years. Consolidated total income of the company for FY23 stood at Rs 40,883 crore over Rs 29,033 crore in FY22 while its consolidated net profit rose 49 per cent at Rs 3,274 crore as against Rs 2,198 crore in 2021-22.
Besides sharpening its focus on luxury, Titan is planning to expand its international footprint in North America and the Middle East and increase its international workforce by 10 per cent over the next five years, with a specific focus on the Gulf market, where around 150-200 new positions will be created in the next two-three years.
A big reason behind Titan's foreign expansion is the Indian government policies. There is a duty on gold in India. It is cheaper for NRIs and PIOs to buy gold outside. As a result, Titan management thinks sales per store in Dubai or the US would be approximately double that of Indian stores. Therefore, if Titan opens 20 stores in the US or Dubai, that would technically mean that those 20 stores would yield a revenue equivalent to 40 stores in India.
Before entering the US market in February this year in the very heart of the diaspora in Little India of New Jersey, Tanishq spent two years studying the North American jewellery market which is considered to be $60 billion and that within the Indian Americans is $3 billion.
The watches and wearables business had a very ambitious target of Rs 10,000 crore revenue at MRP by FY26 and Titan says it is on course for that. ""In fact, we crossed the Rs 5,000- crore mark in FY23. The wearables business has taken off. We have done many things right in the last 24 months and in the last 12 months including reorganising, getting in talent and all that. The results are very much there to show and stay,"" Venkatraman had told ET.
""As far as the eye care business is concerned, the last two-three years were spent substantially in transforming the operations of the business and you will see quarter on quarter results barring a Q4 of FY23 where we deliberately decided to invest in certain parts; in employees, in the company stores as a leap forward in FY24 and in partners barring that, every quarter we have delivered exceptional results,"" he said.
""Now, in FY24 and FY25, we are focusing big time on the market share here as well as it is very, very low. It is at best in the high single digits and we are unique in the part of the business where we play so watches and wearables and eye care, not only are the dreams big, but the positioning is very, very strong.""
A key risk for Titan is India's current account deficit (excess of imports over exports). India’s largest imports include oil and gold. Oil is an essential commodity and its import cannot be lowered. Therefore, to contain its current account deficit, the government’s only choice is to curb the import of gold. For example, in 2013, the RBI issued a circular stating that companies cannot procure gold on lease, which had impacted Titan’s core operations.

Space Mantra

Donear Industries
, people aware of the development told ET.
Space Mantra was the sole resolution applicant for Biyani’s flagship company Future Retail. Lenders had rejected Space Mantra’s Rs 550-crore offer for Future Retail because it was too low.
Donear Industries-owned textile maker GBTL had shown interest in acquiring Future Enterprises – an affiliate of FLFL- but eventually it did not submit a resolution plan. BC Jindal Group-promoted Jindal (India) was the sole resolution applicant for Future Enterprises, ET reported last week.
KPMG-backed resolution professional (RP) Ravi Sethia did not respond to ET’s request for comments.
The RP has admitted Rs 2,117 crore in claims from financial creditors, of which the highest claim is from
State Bank of India
- at Rs 467 crore.

The company told stock exchanges on November 17 that it had received two resolution plans without naming the applicants.
“Although the RP has yet not discussed in detail both the plans, neither of the two offers is attractive,” one of the persons cited above said.
Debt resolution of FLFL suffered a setback in August when it emerged that the forensic auditor appointed by the lenders had undertaken assignments for the promoter Kishore Biyani. Dilip Dixit, a partner of GD Apte & Co, had undertaken an assignment for a Biyani-promoted company before FLFL was admitted for corporate insolvency. He did not disclose this to lenders while undertaking the forensic assignment in July 2022, but a year later, he filed a petition with the Bombay High Court that he was conflicted.
A Bombay High Court division bench on August 11 ruled that neither Dilip Dixit nor GD Apte & Co should undertake the forensic auditor's role for FLFL due to conflict of interest, ET reported on August 22.
FLFL described itself as the flagship fashion company of Future Group in its FY22 annual report. It operated 180 retail stores across formats that included Central, Brand Factory, and exclusive brand outlets. However, its business was hit due to a nationwide shutdown in FY21 to prevent the spread of Covid 19.

Jindal's Rs 301 crore Future bid shocks lenders,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/jindals-rs-301-crore-future-bid-shocks-lenders/articleshow/105299554.cms,18-11-2023,"Mumbai:

)'s bid for
Kishore Biyani
's debt-laden
Future Enterprises
(FEL) amounts to ₹301 crore, or less than 3%, of the total ₹12,265-crore loan exposure, making it almost irrelevant to the
lenders
, people familiar with the process said.
Banks are still scrutinising the offer but such a low bid leaves little room for negotiation and lenders will have to find alternatives to ensure any meaningful recovery from the account, these people said.
""The bid is so low that it is not even worth talking about,"" said one of the persons cited above. ""Though banks have not yet scrutinised the details of the bid, such a low value offer has left everyone disinterested. There is no point in even negotiating for a better value from the bidder, so other options will have to be considered,"" said the person.
Kolkata-based steel tubes and pipes maker Jindal (India), part of the BC Jindal Group, had emerged as the sole bidder for FEL after a more than eight-month process, ET had reported on November 13. FEL owes creditors led by Central Bank of India and its arm Centbank
Financial Services
a total ₹12,265 crore, the second largest debt pile from the defunct retail giant
Future Group
. Though shocked by the low value ascribed by Jindal, banks still have time in hand as the
NCLT
had extended the resolution timeline for the company till March 2024. Lenders said they will assess the options in light of the disappointing Jindal bid.

"D2C brands on GoKwik network experience surge in festive sales, defying traditional trends",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/d2c-brands-on-gokwik-network-experience-surge-in-festive-sales-defying-traditional-trends/articleshow/105228145.cms,15-11-2023,"Direct to consumer brands
on the
GoKwik
network saw a massive surge in order volumes on its platforms during the peak marketplace sale period this year, reversing the trend seen last few years when they see a dip in their orders when marketplaces launch their festive season sales.
During the week long marketplace sales, the GMV for
D2C brands
on the GoKwik network grew 1.5 times in 2023 over the year before. Order volume and GMV surged by 43% and 52%, respectively, around the same time as marketplaces also grew their order volumes. A year ago, brands on the GoKwik network saw a 7% decrease in order volumes and a marginal jump of 6.5% in the
gross merchandise value
(GMV).
“This reversal in trend is a sign of natural progression of the eCommerce market. It means that the market is deepening. It shows that D2C is rapidly gaining popularity among shoppers, who are looking out for best offers and shopping experience,” said Chirag Taneja, co-founder and CEO, GoKwik, adding that the trend reversal did not imply that shoppers preferred D2C over marketplace or vice versa.
“Rather, people are more willing to shop online, be it on marketplaces or on D2C websites, especially if the brands are well established. With better customer experience, D2C is becoming equally popular during festive season shopping,” he added.
The festive season sees a massive uptick in sales as during this time shoppers are high on the intent of making purchases. Traditionally, marketplaces have been able to tap into the potential in the festive season by launching massive sales. D2C brands had shied away from launching sales during this time for fear of high return to origin (RTO) orders and customer acquisition costs.

However, not all brands in the same category get the same traction during marketplace sales and with the help of GoKwik’s suite of solutions to reduce RTOs and improve GMV, many digital-first brands have taken the challenge head on, it said.
This trend is likely to continue at a larger scale in December as well. Last year, the Black Friday Sale weekend (celebrated on the last Friday of November) saw a surge in sales for D2C brands. This trend may also continue this year.
The chances of RTO are significantly higher in cash on delivery (COD) orders than in prepaid orders. GoKwik offers a range of solutions that can predict customer behaviour and help sellers prevent RTOs, while ensuring an expansive COD serviceability across regions. GoKwik houses more than 1000 eCommerce brands in its network including Lenskart, Neemans, Man Matters, Mamaearth etc, ranging from fashion, beauty, health and nutrition, electronics and other key categories of the online shopping space.

HUL to help kiranas compete with bigger players via ONDC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/hul-to-help-kiranas-compete-with-bigger-players-via-ondc/articleshow/105192446.cms,14-11-2023,"Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever (
HUL
) said it will help onboard nearly 1.3 million kirana stores on the central government's Open Network for Digital Commerce (
ONDC
) network, helping them compete with
e-commerce
and quick service grocery retailers.
The move is an extension of its internal ordering app Shikhar, which allows small neighbourhood stores to order directly from it. For HUL, the country's biggest packaged consumer goods firm, the app now accounts for about a third of its sales from neighbourhood retailers. Last year, HUL became the first fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm to join ONDC through its multi-brand direct-to-consumer platform,
UShop
.
""We realised that retailers need to service orders directly instead of HUL doing it through UShop. That's the real democratisation of ecommerce,"" said Kedar Lele, executive director, customer development for HUL. ""With Shikhar, they have come half way and are beginning to order on their own. In the future, 1.3 million retailers could become available on the ONDC network and buy not just HUL products but anything that the retailer sells.""
Lele said HUL plays the role of ""digitalisation agent or hand holding team, which makes a neighbourhood retailer compete with the best, the biggest in e-commerce business for hyper local servicing"".
To begin with, HUL is piloting the initiative through an integrated module in Shikhar called the Shikhar Seller app, where neighbourhood kirana stores can go on live on ONDC and sell the entire catalogue of products online. It is being piloted in New Delhi and Bengaluru, covering 60 outlets, and will be scaled up across India in a phased manner.

""This is the right time in our belief to start enabling because as ONDC starts growing, is the time when the retailer starts plugging into it. And with that momentum, we will be able to service the retailer as well and they will be able to hold on to their share of business, which otherwise will become difficult for them,"" said Lele.
ONDC is a freely accessible and inclusive platform that aims to democratise e-commerce. It is expected to benefit small merchants with more advanced technologies and better business mechanisms. At present there are about 12 million mom-and-pop stores in India, of which only about 0.12% are tech enabled, while e-retail accounts for only 4% of the $800 billion
retail
market in India.
Joining the open network creates an opportunity for retailers to operate in an e-commerce ecosystem that works without pre-determined barriers, said experts.
""ONDC ensures a level playing field for digital retailers of all sizes, granting visibility and democratising the digital commerce landscape. Sellers enjoy the freedom to set their terms and conditions, register once for discoverability and retain high profit margins without commission deductions. Direct connections with buyers eliminate intermediation risks and third-party charges, boosting profitability,"" said T Koshy, managing director, ONDC, adding that the network also offers services such as logistics and enhanced analytics, enabling retailers to optimise operations and enhance overall business performance.
HUL has the biggest retail network reach among FMCG companies in India, with its products reaching nine million kirana stores. Last year, parent Unilever called its Indian unit a digital and innovation powerhouse after several of HUL's local tech and digitisation initiatives, including Shikhar, were being adopted by several developing countries.

Garment industry sees lacklustre Diwali sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/garment-industry-sees-lacklustre-diwali-sales/articleshow/105191893.cms,13-11-2023,"Pune: Sales of almost everything from cars to jewellery to mobile phones and electronics have increased this
festive season
, but clothing and garments have seen flat
Diwali sales
- and nobody seems to know why.
Bhivandi powerloom industry, which caters to the garment needs of the domestic market, is taking a 20-day holiday this month due to the bearish trend that has affected the entire
textile value chain
including
cotton farmers
, ginners and spinning mills.
""The sentiments in the
domestic garment market
have been subdued even since the Durga Puja except last weekend,"" said
Rahul Mehta
, chief mentor of Clothing Manufacturers' Association of India (
CMAI
). ""This was the period of lowest demand seen during a festive season after Covid.""
The industry is struggling to figure out the reasons for poor festive sales, especially when other sectors such as FMCG and electronic goods are doing good.
""Although we are not able to know the exact reason for the sluggish demand, we think that the people are not enthusiastic about buying new clothes as they are probably sufficiently stocked up,"" Mehta said. ""Or, the lure for buying new electronic items could be stronger than for buying new clothes.""
Live Events
The entire value chain from fibre to fabric has reported sluggish demand.
The harvesting of the kharif cotton has begun, but farmers are waiting for the cotton prices to increase to Rs 8,000 per quintal from the prevailing Rs 7000-7,200/quintal before selling, industry insiders said.
""Farmers are not willing to sell cotton at prevailing the rates,"" said Pradeep Jain, chairman of
Khandesh Ginning and Pressing Association
. ""A majority of ginners are in losses as the demand from the spinning mills is subdued,"" he added.
There is not much export demand for Indian cotton and yarn either as global prices are lower than Indian prices, industry insiders said.

festive season
so far, traders' body CAIT said on Monday. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) stated that festivals like Goverdhan Pooja, Bhaiya Dooj, Chhath Pooja and Tulsi Vivah are yet to be solemnised, which may attract additional trade worth Rs 50,000 crore.
""Notably, almost only Indian products were sold and purchased this Diwali, which is remarkable,"" it stated.
CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said
Chinese goods
lost a trade worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore during the Diwali festive season.
""In previous years, Chinese products were occupying nearly 70 per cent market of Diwali festivals. However, this year, appeal of Prime Minister

luggage
brand
Delsey Paris
is looking to make
India
a manufacturing hub, part of its global strategy to shift half its production out of Mainland China, global chief executive
Davide Traxler
said.
India is among the fastest growing market for the French brand and currently accounts for 5% of its total revenue. The company plans to double the revenue in the next three years. ""India is one of the economies that we have very positive outlook for the next five years. We are all looking for what's going to happen in the US, what's going happen in Europe, but everyone seemed very confident in India. And that is very important because it's such a huge population and a huge market. It is certainly a land where we want more presence, investing more and also sourcing more and purchasing raw materials,"" said Traxler.
A recent
Crisil
report said India's luggage industry revenue is set to rise 5% on-year this fiscal despite a high-base effect of 40% growth last fiscal due to rising penetration of hard luggage made by the organised sector, and continuing growth in tourism and corporate
travel
. ""There was a lot of concentration in mainland China, but we have moved about 50% of production and distributed it to other countries in Southeast Asia and India is part of this rebalancing of our production,"" said Traxler.
The company said growth in travel has been constant for the past 30 years and luggage is related to how much people travel.

""India is doing well and overall the company is doing well. We have more than doubled the turnover in the past two years and India is part of this trend,"" the executive said.
Traxler
said that the consumer has changed its approach towards the purchase of luggage.
""Consumers are shifting from a very practical and utilitarian touristic approach of a functional luggage to something that is more to a certain extent, an extension of their style. So, people are looking for the colour they like, for the shape they like,"" he said. As a result, its best sellers that used to be black and dark grey are now ivory or green or brown. Delsey Paris has collaborated with United Colors of Benetton in the design of a co-branded luggage and travel accessory range. The products in collection will be sold via brands' websites and through Benetton and Delsey Paris point of sales worldwide. ""We will have more license agreements,"" Traxler said.
The brand produces about four million pieces a year and in India it wants to ramp up the production gradually. ""Potential of the market is huge in terms of sales and in terms of production. Initially, we will produce only for India, but the next step will be to export the products,"" the executive said.
Traxler said the main challenge is restriction on travels, which is impacted by geopolitical elements. ""There are more countries where people are not so comfortable to go.

Future Retail approaches liquidation as efforts to secure buyer fall short,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/future-retail-approaches-liquidation-as-efforts-to-secure-buyer-fall-short/articleshow/105140971.cms,11-11-2023,"The once-thriving retail empire of
Kishore Biyani
, known as the ""Raja of Retail,"" is on the brink of closure as
Future Retail
heads towards liquidation. The insolvency professional overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings has recommended the liquidation of Future Retail, a company that suffered a significant blow with the loss of key locations following the takeover by
Reliance Retail
.
In response to the Committee of Creditors' rejection of the resolution plan from
Space Mantra
, a construction materials platform, Future Retail confirmed the insolvency professional's move to initiate the liquidation process. The application for liquidation under Section 33 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, was filed with the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
),
Mumbai bench
, on November 9, according to a TOI report.
The resolution plan presented by Space Mantra faced a setback when it garnered only 42% support in the vote held on September 30. The plan required a minimum of 66% approval from lenders to proceed. Following the regulatory guidelines of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), the insolvency professional is obligated to file for liquidation based on the voting outcomes.
Reliance Retail, which took over the tenancy of Future Retail's key locations, holds total approved claims amounting to Rs 19,400 crore. In contrast, Space Mantra's bid of Rs 550 crore was not endorsed by the lenders. Notably, other bidders who submitted binding offers were predominantly scrap dealers, indicating the challenging landscape faced by Future Retail in its quest for revival. As the curtains draw on this retail saga, the industry watches closely to witness the resolution of this insolvency drama.
Insolvency proceedings
The NCLT had granted four extensions to
FRL
for completion of CIRP and the last date was September 30, 2023, and after that there was no extension in the time frame.

The insolvency proceedings against FRL were started by the tribunal on July 20, 2022.
The Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) mandates the completion of CIRP within 330 days, which includes time taken during litigations.
As per Section 12 (1) of the Code, the CIRP shall be completed within a period of 180 days from the date of initiation.
However, NCLT may grant a one-time extension of 90 days. The maximum time within which CIRP must be mandatorily completed, including any extension or litigation period, is 330 days.
Earlier, FRL had said it had received six bids from prospective buyers by May 15, which was the last date for submission of resolution plans.
The deadline for submission of resolution plans was May 15, 2023, for 48 companies, which were in the final list of 'Eligible Prospective Resolution Applicants'.
This has happened despite FRL lenders coming with revised Expressions of Interest (EoIs) and inviting fresh bids after dividing its assets into clusters.
Future Retail has a debt of around Rs 30,000 crore and the company is going through CIRP.
On March 23, 2023, creditors of FRL invited new EoIs, whereby prospective buyers can bid for the debt-ridden firm ""as a going concern or individual cluster or a combination of clusters of its assets"", as it failed to attract a resolution plan in more than four months.
FRL operated multiple retail formats in both the hypermarket supermarket and home segments under brands such as
Big Bazaar
, Easyday, and Foodhall. At its peak, FRL was operating more than 1,500 outlets in nearly 430 cities.
It was part of the 19 Future group companies operating in the retail, wholesale, logistic and warehousing segments, which were supposed to be transferred to
Reliance
Retail as part of a Rs 24,713-crore deal announced in August 2020.
However, lenders had rejected the takeover of the 19 Future group companies, including FRL, by Reliance amid a legal challenge by Amazon.

Nanda said Amazon fully aligns with Modi's call to promote local entrepreneurship. ""We recognise, respect and celebrate the small businesses and local sellers for their grit, conviction and perseverance to succeed,"" he said.
Modi's 'vocal for local' call came on Dhanteras, a day when purchasing items made of gold, silver and brass is considered auspicious, and doing so is perceived to usher in prosperity and success in people's lives.
Amazon India launched a 'Dhanteras Store', curating products like gold and silver coins, festive jewellery, pooja items, etc. Homegrown brands like Malabar Gold and Diamonds, PC Chandra, Zeya by Kundan, and PN Gadgil were among the brands available.
Ecommerce platform
Meesho
told ET that this festive season it onboarded 200,000 new sellers, championing the spirit of 'vocal for local'.
The company said more than 40% of its 1.5 million sellers and nearly 80% of its orders originate in tier 2+ regions, adding that, ""Meesho is embracing the diversity of our nation and empowering small-scale entrepreneurs across the country.""
""The momentum generated by this initiative (vocal for local) has significantly influenced consumer preferences towards made-in-India products,"" said Vinod Kumar, president of India Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) Forum. Emphasising the importance of supporting local businesses for a stronger MSME sector, he said, ""The harmonious blend of 'vocal for local' and ecommerce is set to make this festive period exceptionally lucrative for our MSMEs.""
Kumar expects e-tail to hit ?90,000 crore this festive season.
British multinational confectionery major Cadbury has launched the 'ghar ki dukan' campaign for Cadbury Celebrations to promote local sellers.
The pan-India campaign puts the spotlight on thousands of small business owners, giving them the visibility they need to have a bumper Diwali, the company said in a press release. The idea is to channel prosperity towards small local businesses selling seasonal items such as hand painted diyas, kandli, homemade snacks, desserts, candles and jewellery.
""Vocal for local has certainly raised awareness of urban buyers about products produced by artisans and the need to support them not only from a humanitarian angle but from the point of view of the economy,"" said Anil Bhardwaj, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Micro Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME). ""When millions have more money in their hand, the aggregate numbers or GDP also bounce upwards,"" he added.
The younger population is also actively looking for homegrown, sustainable and green products.
According to Rahul Gope, cofounder and chief executive of collaborative commerce platform Oyela, the younger demographic makes up 80% of buyers on their platform. ""This statistic suggests a distinct preference among the younger demographic for locally made products,"" he said.
""Products labelled as 'handmade' or 'handcrafted by local artisans' consistently outperform mass-produced alternatives, experiencing a 25% higher conversion rate on our platform,"" Gope said.

Future Retail Lenders at odds with RP,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/future-retail-lenders-at-odds-with-rp/articleshow/105077100.cms,08-11-2023,"Future Retail lenders
are concerned that the Deloitte-backed
resolution professional
, Vijaykumar Iyer, has yet not filed an application with the
bankruptcy court
to liquidate the company even after five weeks have elapsed since they voted against the sole revival plan.
Lenders have sought an explanation from Iyer for his failure to file an application but if it is not satisfactory, they may seek legal advice on the matter, said people involved in the resolution process.
The development comes within a fortnight of the
lenders
issuing a legal notice to Iyer for putting on the block inventories of Future Retail without seeking their approval. At a voting held on September 30, majority lenders rejected Space Mantra's '550-crore plan for Kishore Biyani-promoted Future Retail. Despite five weeks having passed, Iyer has not filed an application for liquidation before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
For a plan to be approved, 66% of lenders should vote in favour. In the case of Future Retail, only 42% voted in favour.
As per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India's (IBBI) regulations, the
RP
should immediately file an application with the NCLT based on the outcome of the voting.

Soon after the voting on Future Retail concluded, the RP had proposed to restart the sale process, but most lenders rejected this proposal, as reported by ET on October 1. Lenders are also in the process of identifying a liquidator. The IBBI rule stipulates an RP cannot be the liquidator for the same company.
The RP, who declined to comment to ET, has admitted '28,114 crore claims from trader creditors, lenders and employees.
Already, lenders were surprised that the RP did not consult them before putting on the block inventories of Future Retail, particularly after they rejected Space Mantra's plan, the people cited above said.
On October 17, the RP invited offers for the inventories of FRL lying in certain identified stores and warehouses across various locations in India, the notice stated. Responding to this, on October 23, Saraf and Partners, the legal counsel of lenders, issued a notice to the RP asking him to withdraw the sale notice immediately.
""The assets of a company can be sold either under a resolution plan approved by lenders or under a liquidation process. There is no provision to sell assets after a plan is rejected but before the liquidation process is initiated,"" said a legal expert.
Even before the lenders had begun voting on the resolution plan,
HDFC Bank
in a letter dated August 29 to member banks, had pointed out that the RP failed in his duty to maximise value for financial creditors and that Space Mantra's plan 'suffers from gross illegalities'. The letter stated that RP had not provided critical information to the committee of creditors to allow them to make an informed commercial decision on the resolution plan.

is on track to reach its target of sourcing $10-billion worth of goods from
India
each year by 2027, a senior executive said.
“We don't disclose individual numbers on progress, but we feel confident about the goals that we have set forth,” Andrea Albright, executive vice president, sourcing, at Walmart, told ET.
India is already one of the top sourcing markets for the world’s largest retailer with annual exports worth about $3 billion, according to the company.
Hundreds of Indian sellers have joined
Walmart Marketplace
since it opened this year and many of them have seen double-digit growth, the company said.
Major differentiators for India include the size of the workforce, the range of category coverage, and the price point being “very competitive”, Albright said. “Everything from food to antibiotics, drug manufacturing, toys, apparel and home…it is such a breadth of categories and that’s quite unique to have in one country,” she said.

Big-bang luxury sales add to Diwali shine,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/big-bang-luxury-sales-add-to-diwali-shine/articleshow/105024483.cms,07-11-2023,"New Delhi: What are you gifting your loved ones this Diwali? High-end stuff is hot, apparently. From desserts to bags and jewellery, sales of
luxury items
are surging, driven by a flourishing economy, according to retailers and companies.
""Renowned international brands such as
Louis Vuitton
, Dior, Cartier, Bulgari,
Gucci
and
Giorgio Armani
are leading the way, with increased sales compared to last year,"" said Pushpa Bector, senior executive director at
DLF
Retail. DLF's luxury portfolio includes the DLF Emporio and The Chanakya malls in Delhi. Higher spending per customer than last year across all luxury categories signals an uptick in overall expenditure this festive season.
""Hermes and Chanel stores at The Chanakya mall in Delhi are consistently booked for festive appointments,"" Bector said. ""There is a growing demand for distinctive products.""
Some brands have introduced special Diwali products for India, including limited editions available exclusively in the country. Diwali is on November 12.
""For instance, Bulgari offers the Mangalsutra, while Jimmy Choo has a Diwali capsule collection promoted through a campaign featuring Bollywood actress Ananya Pandey,"" Bector said.
Live Events
The Horsebit 1955 bag from Gucci, originally crafted over seven decades ago, has been exclusively launched in a distinct shade of gold for Diwali and is available at the label's stores across India.
""Adorned with crystals on the Horsebit small shoulder bag, the embellished touch highlights the festive spirit of the season,"" stated Gucci.
Sales of high-end products are up this year because brands have also ensured that products available overseas can be bought at their stores locally, said Uzma Irfan, corporate communications director at Prestige Group, which operates UB City Mall in Bengaluru.
She also manages operations and leasing for the mall.
""It is Diwali time and everyone wants to spend now and live for today. Home brands, fashion and accessories categories in the luxury segment are doing very well,"" she said.
Spanish porcelain label Lladro's India CEO Nikhil Lamba said there has been an increase in sales in the lighting category as people shift to their newly constructed homes this Diwali.
""As contemporary interior aesthetics continue to be the growing trend, the contribution of the design category or the contemporary designs which are bold, striking and playful have grown by 52% over last year,"" he said. ""A growth of 60% comes from home decor accessories like clocks, trays, vases and decorative plates which are very popular for gifting in the festive season.""
Lladro's lighting units cost over Rs 5 lakh while high-porcelain products are priced at Rs 10 lakh and above. Products in the gifting category can go up to Rs 1.5 lakh.
Luxury Swiss chocolate brand Laderach opened its first boutique store in India in Delhi in August and the response has been ""phenomenal,"" according to spokesperson Riti Gupta. The Dharampal Satyapal Group (DS Group) is Laderach's exclusive partner in India.
""The growing preference for luxury items coupled with a desire to explore newer options for gifting is driving Laderach sales,"" Gupta said. ""The per-capita consumption of chocolates in India is far lower than the global standards and the luxury segment is growing in India so that's the opportunity Laderach is able to harness.""
Gupta said Laderach aims to open five to seven exclusive stores over the next two years. Chef Julien Alvarez, executive pastry chef at French luxury pastry brand Maison Laduree, has created special Diwali treats for customers in India.
""Our turnover has grown year on year and people are out there to buy,"" said Chandni Nath Israni, cofounder and managing director of the CK Israni Group, which has brought the pastry brand to India. ""We have curated special Diwali gifting boxes that are selling like hotcakes. Macarons are also a healthier and a lighter snack compared to other options.""
Sales of pre-owned luxury watches are also seeing an uptick.
""This quarter, sales will see a 3x to 4x jump compared to other quarters,"" said Arjun Singh Hira, founder of chronoseconds.com that sells pre-owned luxury watches and is marketing a vibrant Grand Seiko rose gold watch as an ideal Diwali gift. ""Its retail price is Rs 28 lakh and we have listed it for Rs 15 lakh on our website.""

Damodar
Mall
, the chief executive of Reliance Retail (value format), said in an interview with ET that the consumer growth story is more interesting in small towns, also known as feeder markets.
""In the Supermarket India that I see - in modern stores or on digital apps - there are no signs of any downward impact on discretionary spending,"" he said. ""The narrative of some players that non-food is not growing is not a macro consumer concern, but maybe an insight that they are possibly not updating their operating models enough.""
Mall's comment contrasts with the views of some retailers and analysts that discretionary spending has been under pressure in recent months.
""Home, personal care, general merchandise - all are growing faster than the overall store for us. Feeder markets in smaller towns such as Nokha, Sikar in Rajasthan, Armoor and Banswada in Telangana, and Raygada and Simliguda in Odisha have upbeat demand trends, Mall said.

Reliance Retail is the retail unit of
Reliance Industries
. It is the largest grocery retailer in the country which operates stores in multiple formats -
Smart
Superstore,
Smart Point
, Smart Bazaar, Fresh Signature, Freshpik and 7-Eleven.
""We are seeing uptrading across categories and
FMCG
companies facing a slowdown in modern trade may need to do more to grow in tune with the market,"" Mall said.
ET Bureau
Demand in rural markets has been soft for multiple reasons. Persistent inflation has impacted rural demand, which contributed to more than one-third of FMCG sales, as consumers are still tightening discretionary spending after uneven rains, according to analysts.
Reliance Retail has also been driving sales of its FMCG products -soft drinks under the Sosyo Hajoori brand, confectionaries under Lotus Chocolates, biscuits under Maliban, Campa Cola, Glimmer beauty soaps, Get Real natural soaps, Puric hygiene soaps, Dozo dishwash bars and liquids, HomeGuard toilet and floor cleaners, and Enzo laundry detergent powder, liquid and bars.
""We do not do private labels, or white labels, as they are conventionally approached,"" Mall said. ""Our customers buy
SnacTac
snacks or besan laddoo because they are good things, and most of them may not even know that SnacTac is our brand.""
In the second quarter, Reliance Retail's grocery segment reported 33% growth on a yearly basis, led by Smart and Smart Bazaar formats. The company highlighted that demand was strong during the festivals in the quarter. In the June quarter this year, the grocery business had reported a year-on-year growth of 59%.
In their September quarter earnings, leading FMCG makers like
HUL
,
ITC
and
Nestle
have expressed concern over uneven rains, the impact of crop output and rising prices of commodities such as wheat, maida, sugar, potato and coffee.
""FMCG companies are learning to think of premiumisation differently for urban, modern trade and rural consumers,"" Mall said. ""We need more of this to happen.""

"E-comm story over next 5-10 yrs around value lifestyle segment growth, want decent slice of that opportunity: Snapdeal CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/e-comm-story-over-next-5-10-yrs-around-value-lifestyle-segment-growth-want-decent-slice-of-that-opportunity-snapdeal-ceo/articleshow/104987062.cms,05-11-2023,"Snapdeal
believes the e-commerce story over the next 5-10 years will be around the growth of the 'value' lifestyle segment, and the online marketplace is looking to corner a ""decent slice of this opportunity"" as it focuses on unit economics, quality checks, and use of AI as well as tech to measure and improve customer experience. Snapdeal's business metrics are ""in a good space"" in the value e-commerce category and it has opted to ""reinvest in growth now"" as financial parameters are within striking distance of profitability, Himanshu
Chakrawarti
, CEO of Snapdeal, told PTI.
In an interview, Chakrawarti said that Snapdeal expects a ""normal"" festive season, which typically yields a 25-30 per cent surge in demand over other months.
""As per estimates the value (lifestyle retail) market in India is growing significantly, from USD 88 billion to USD 175 billion. Also along with this, the e-commerce portion is going to increase from 8 per cent to 22 per cent...we are largely focused on our journey because this opportunity size is huge,"" Chakrawarti said.
The e-commerce story over the next 5-10 years will play around the 'value' segment, and Snapdeal is eyeing a ""decent"" slice of the market opportunity, he said.
""We are not saying we'll carve 60-70 per cent of this market. We are saying we want a decent slice of this opportunity that is coming up, and that we feel can be done if we focus our energy entirely on our unit economics, which is what we do, and the customer proposition,"" he said.
Live Events
Founded by Kunal Bahl and
Rohit Bansal
in 2010, Snapdeal saw a storied rise commanding a valuation of an estimated USD 6.5 billion at its peak, but later battled survival issues alongside a failed merger with
Flipkart
. It also faced market share erosion amid stiff competition.
Snapdeal resurrected itself with the '2.0' version, scripting a turnaround strategy with an aim to focus on affordable lifestyle products for budget-conscious buyers in tier-II towns - the value segment, and tighter checks on quality measures.
""Now for the consumer of Bharat, who are not necessarily completely native with the digital medium, for them to come onto the platform and try to figure out through ratings and reviews and detailing, the quality part is a bit tough. So we are putting in all guardrails in place whereby the product offering or the range on our platform is of a certain quality,"" he said.
Snapdeal, he said, has crafted the consumer experience for the cohort of 'value lifestyle' customers, who have entered the online shopping space over the last 4-6 years. At present, men's wear, women's ethnic wear, footwear, and home categories are popular, accounting for a big chunk of Snapdeal's revenue.
""Further, most of these customers are fairly new to e-commerce transactions. Now, our platform is built in a manner where we help and guide them...All the steps are quite easy to understand...The text is large and limited, there is a high focus on visuals, and support comes in at every stage through voice and vernacular,"" he said.
According to Chakrawarti, the platform has leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning
(ML) tools, and data science capabilities to maximise customer experience.
""We focused a lot on the customer experience, measuring it at various touchpoints. We have made massive progress...Escalation matrix are very clearly defined and they trigger in automatically...we are using tech, data and data sciences to make the customer experience easier,"" he said.
The e-commerce company, which caters to 97 per cent of pin codes, is keen to expand the depth of its offering in markets, including southern India, and widen regional focus, going forward.
The ""stringent quality measures"" are aimed at ringfencing customers and creating transparent mechanisms, according to Snapdeal.
""We have travelled a long way on this path,"" Chakrawarti said, adding that while new sellers have come in, those not complying with quality parameters have moved out of the platform, keeping the number of sellers by and large the same over the last 2-3 years.
Since Snapdeal has exited certain categories, the customer numbers and traffic are lower, but the platform is seeing 75 per cent of business from repeat customers, demonstrating buyer stickiness.
On whether competition with deep pockets puts Snapdeal at a certain disadvantage, he said, ""No, because the market is large and so there will be people looking for honest, good pricing with good control on quality. They will discover and keep coming back to us"".
On the FY24 expectation, Chakrawarti declined to talk about growth targets, but said Snapdeal is ""travelling quite well along the growth path"".
""...we are not looking at doubling, tripling of our topline every year. Our growth is essentially coming in on the Snapdeal platform which has been a good robust mechanism this year. But also along with that we have opened up our 'house of brands' which is again providing us overall growth as a business,"" he said, adding that both the verticals ""are shaping up quite well"".
The past six months have been ""quite good"" and Snapdeal is now looking forward to the festive season which is ""important"".
""Where we have reached over the last 3-4 months is...we are now along the 'black' line (profitability)...We are virtually there. But we are now putting our energies into fuelling growth. So we have the option of actually taking into it, into proper 'black' or actually reinvesting to start growing again in a big way, and we have decided to re-invest this on growth both for Snapdeal and for
Stellaro Brands
,"" he said.

Luxury brands script clause to share space with equals at Jio World Plaza,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/luxury-brands-script-clause-to-share-space-with-equals-at-jio-world-plaza/articleshow/104952007.cms,04-11-2023,"Some of the super-luxury brands that have opened stores at the recently inaugurated luxury mall,
Jio World Plaza
in Mumbai, have put in a condition that at least four top brands - such as
Louis Vuitton
,
Gucci
,
Cartier
, Burberry,
Tiffany
, Valentino, Bulgari, Zegna, Giorgio Armani and Bottega Veneta - should be present in the same complex, to ensure the position of their brands is not diluted.
ET has seen copies of the agreements between
Reliance Industries
, the owner of Jio World Centre, and five brands, accessed through data analytic firm CRE Matrix.
Reliance Industries and the brands did not respond to emails seeking comment till press time on Friday. Brands often have an exclusivity clause with the mall where they don't want competing brands near their stores. However, in the high-end segment, to ensure a similar buyer profile, they want similar stores nearby. Jio World Plaza already meets the condition with several of these super-luxury brands having opened their outlets there.
""If at least four among the mentioned brands are not open within six months of us starting the operation, we should be entitled to a reduction of the licence fee by 25% for the period that this criteria remains unfulfilled,"" Christian Dior Trading, which will operate Dior, has said in the agreement.
Dior will pay ₹21.56 lakh in monthly rent for a 3,317 sq ft space in the complex. Gucci has given a list of six luxury brands - Louis Vuitton, Dior, Cartier, Bulgari, Valentino and Burberry - and demanded that at least four have to be represented in the shopping centre.

Louis Vuitton, Cartier and Bulgari have also put in similar conditions. Most of them have kept the right to terminate the agreement after serving the notice for nine to 12 months.
""In the super-luxury segment, most of the brands complement each other and that is why they want the presence of these brands next to each other. Good mall developers also go with zoning of brands and don't want to mix the super-luxury brands with the premium or mid to premium brands. As more luxury brands are contemplating India entry, we will see more luxury spaces coming up,"" said Devangshu Dutta, founder of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight.
India only has a handful of malls that give space exclusively to super-luxury brands.

The beauty division, which includes Sephora, contributed Rs 337 crore to Arvind Fashion's fiscal 2023 revenue, accounting for about 7.6% of the total.
""We are tremendously excited to partner with the largest retail group in India to step-change our business. Rising affluence, increasing urbanisation and the proliferation of social media have driven greater awareness of self-care and beauty, unlocking major opportunities for prestige beauty. It is an opportune time for us to invest in expanding our presence, and bring new, exciting, and exclusive brands to delight our growing community of beauty enthusiasts,"" said Alia Gogi, Asia President, Sephora.
Reliance Retail, the top retailer in the nation, faces competition from brands such as Lakme by
HUL
,
Nykaa
, Tata, and Sephora by LVMH in India's expanding beauty and personal care market.
According to a joint report by Redseer Strategy Consultant and Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia) - the Indian beauty and personal care market is estimated to grow to USD 30 billion by 2027, accounting for 5 per cent of the global market, according to a report.
The Indian Beauty and Personal Care (BPC) market -- estimated to be around USD 19 billion in 2022 -- has very low per capita spend in the category but as the country prospers, the growth headroom will materialise strongly, the report said
India is uniquely positioned as one of the most attractive and fastest-growing BPC markets globally, the report said.
Shares of Arvind Fashions surged 11.5% after the news, before trimming some gains to close 5.8% higher.

JSW One set to cross $1 billion mark in GMV this FY,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/jsw-one-set-to-cross-1-billion-mark-in-gmv-this-fy/articleshow/104806072.cms,02-11-2023,"JSW One Platforms
- the
e-commerce venture
of the
JSW Group
- is set to cross the $1 billion mark on an exit rate basis in gross merchandise value before the close of the current financial year, boosted by strong traction seen in the first half of the year.
“We had said that we will exit at a billion dollars in
FY24
, and today it is looking larger than that,”
Gaurav Sachdeva
, the chief executive officer told ET in an interaction. “In fact, we will hit the billion dollar run-rate ahead of that,” he said.
The platform, which sells flat and long products of steel, stainless less and cement to micro, small and medium enterprises, has seen its sales surge more than four times to over 1,700 crore rupees or about $220 million in the first half of 2023-24 (Apr-Mar) as compared to the previous year.
On a full-year basis, the company is looking at a gross merchandise value (GMV) of around 5,500 crore rupees. It plans to clock in $5 billion in
GMV
by FY27, also the year by which it is looking at turning profitable.
“There are three key things - the availability of material, its quality, and the credit - so the idea is to leverage our brand and distribution and provide a one-stop shop for MSMEs to buy steel,” he said.

About 40-42% of the company’s sales comes from
JSW Steel
, the flagship company of the JSW Group and currently the largest producer of steel in the country. The platform gets another 40% of its sales from distributors - who stock products from varied companies.
While it currently gets most of its sales from steel products, the company plans to diversify into other offerings as well. “Today we see demand for
TMT
(bars) and cement together in most cases, and paints will be an offering going ahead,” Sachdeva said.
Given that steel and cement are sectors where sales have traditionally happened through distribution networks, the company is seeing customers return to its platform, boosting sales.
The platform currently has more than 33,000 customers on its platform, and gets about half its orders from repeat customers. “The availability of material, transparent pricing, good quality and trust in the JSW brand - these are the things leading customers back to the platform time and again,” he said.

Reliance extends Urban Ladder's presence at Smart Bazaar outlets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-extends-urban-ladders-presence-at-smart-bazaar-outlets/articleshow/104784642.cms,28-10-2023,"Leading retailer
Reliance
has extended the presence of its furniture and home decor brand
Urban Ladder
at its hypermarkets chain
Smart Bazaar
and also through b2b institutional sales.
Reliance Retail
, which owns lingerie brands Clovia, Amante, and Zivame, also said that it has now become a market leader in the women's innerwear market.
""Our new businesses in lingerie, we are making good progress. We are the largest player in this segment now,"" said
Reliance Retail CFO
Dinesh Taluja during Friday's earnings call of
RIL
.
Now Reliance Retail is looking to expand the lingerie category across retail formats such as Trends, Azorte, Centro and Blushlace, he said.
""We continue to expand our in-house brands and we operate across the spectrum from mid-premium to luxury. We are focusing on general trade so that these brands have wide distribution, which will further deepen the penetration, and that continues to be a focus for all our brands in the portfolio within this segment,"" Taluja added.
Over Urban Ladder, now an omni-channel business, the focus is to provide more and more touch points to the customer, Taluja said.
Live Events
At these stores, customers can touch and feel the product through experience centres as well as by online or in the stores, he said.
""We are also expanding the category by putting it under many of the
Smart Bazaars

Smart Bazaars are chain of hypermarkets operated by Reliance Retail.
Besides, Reliance Retail, which has launched its own FMCG brand 'Independence', is expanding it to pan-India.
""Independence brand which we had launched earlier in the year continues its growth momentum. We are now expanding it nationally as well as expanding it to multiple categories,"" he said.
Its cola brand Campa is also doing well and has had very good traction.
""The focus for the business has been to expand the distribution channel and deepen the engagement with general trade. We delivered 4x growth in revenue in this business during the quarter,"" it said.
Reliance Retail is expanding its FMCG play through several acquisitions.
""During the quarter we completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Ed-a-Mamma which is a kids' wear brand as well as we completed acquisition of a controlling stake in
Superdry IP
for India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh territory,"" said Taluja.
Reliance on Friday reported an increase of 21.04 per cent in its net profit in the September quarter to Rs 2,790 crore. Its revenue from operation surged 19.48 per cent to Rs 68,937 crore, helped by growth across consumption baskets, increase in footfalls and store expansion.

Why Ambani and Jindal see future in debt-laden Future Group,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/why-ambani-and-jindal-see-future-in-debt-laden-future-group/articleshow/104779354.cms,28-10-2023,"Once known as the ""king of Indian retail"" and ‘Sam Walton of India’, founder & CEO of Future Group
Kishore Biyani
now stands on the rubble of his business empire. Biyani, who had created one of the largest retail empires in the country spanning several formats including Big Bazaar, Central, and Easyday, became a victim of his own high ambitions. Now, Mukesh Ambani-controlled
Reliance Retail
and Naveen Jindal's
Jindal
(India) are looking to buy whatever is left of Biyani's once magnificent empire.
The downfall of Biyani's
Future Group
had started with the 2008 financial crisis when debt staretd pinching. He got some respite in 2012 by selling stakes in Pantloon Retail to Aditya Birla Group for nearly Rs 1,600 crore and Future Capital, his finance business, to Warburg Pincus for nearly Rs Rs 560 crore. That had still left Future Group with an estimated debt of Rs 6,000 crore. And then came a flurry of shopping when Biyani bought several brands such as Easyday, Nilgiris group and Hypercity. In 2019, Biyani again tried to pare debt by selling a 49% stake in Future Coupons for around Rs 1,500 crore to Amazon. Just when he felt comfortable, the pandmeic struck and eroded his business empire. Biyani's weakness was being over-ambitious by indiscriminately acquiring other businesses and diversifying into non-core businesses such as finance and insurance. He had also tried making films and ended up producing a few flops.
In 2020, Biyani proposed a Rs 24,700 crore sale of all of his business, 19 group companies, to
Reliance
Retail which was rejected by his lenders amid a legal challenge by Amazon, and his companies entered for debt resolution under the IBC.
Now, Jindal and
Ambani
, two big tycoons, are facing off for
Future Enterprises
assets. Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Retail has sought time till October 30 to decide if it wants to bid for Future Enterprises, ET has reported based on information from sources..

Future Enterprises Ltd has Rs 11,000 crore of debt. It was admitted for insolvency proceedings in February by the National Company Law Tribunal in response to a petition filed by a creditor claiming the company had defaulted on payments. 19 Future Group companies including
Future Retail
,
Future Lifestyle Fashions
,
Future Consumer
and Future Supply Chain would merge into Future Enterprises.
Future Enterprises has retail and wholesale businesses including Big Bazaar, fbb, Foodhall, Easyday, Nilgiris, Central and Brand Factory as well as logistics and warehouse business.
In 2020, Future Group had decided to combine its nearly two dozen listed and unlisted companies and sell them on a slump sale basis to rival Reliance Retail for about Rs 25,000 crore as debt ballooned. Reliance has 1,100 supermarkets, while Future has around 1,500. The Future deal will immediately boost the retail footprint of Reliance, which has attracted marquee foreign investors in the business, Reuters had reported.
The Future Generali stake
Unlike its sister concern Future Retail, which received bids from only scrap dealers, creditors are hoping for a better outcome from the insolvency process of Future Enterprises, which owns stakes in life and general insurance joint ventures that Biyani had struck with Italy's Generali group in 2006.
Assuming Future Enterprises' insolvency process results in a better debt resolution acceptable to all creditors, the winning bidder could become the rightful owner of a 25.5% stake in Future Generali's general insurance company and receive a nearly 9% stake in Future Generali's life insurance company.
The general insurance company was valued at Rs 5,000 crore in May last year when Generali raised its stake in the company from 49% to 74%. It paid Rs 1,267 crore to purchase the additional stake to take advantage of liberalised foreign direct investment guidelines in the insurance sector.
How RIL can benefit from the deal
Reliance Industries
' acquisition of Future Group's consumer business will strengthen the retail footprint of India's largest organised retailer. The retail business will be the fastest growing segment for RIL in future, Chairman Mukesh Ambani has said. RIL has invested $10 billion for the expansion of the retail business in the past two years.
The company opened more than 3,300 new stores last fiscal year, taking the total count to over 18,000 stores and that two-thirds of them were in tier-II, -III cities and smaller towns. The digital and new commerce sales contributed nearly Rs 50,000 crore last fiscal, accounting for about a fifth of the retail revenue. The business also crossed the milestone of 100 crore transactions and received more than 78 crore footfalls in FY23. It has sold stakes in its retail business to biggies.
Sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority has invested in Reliance Retail recently, taking the valuation of the business to Rs 8.28 lakh crore.
Future Enterprises with its vast retail footprint will add to the already humongous retail empire of the RIL. ""The acquisition will strengthen RIL's position within the organised retail sector in India as it will be able to leverage on established brand names and vast network of stores currently owned and operated by the Future Group entities,"" rating agency Moody's had said.
The acquisition will also allow RIL to step-up its retail footprint in states and territories where it currently does not have a significant presence. Acquisition of Future's retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units may help RIL almost double its retail footprint.
""The transaction is credit positive because it will solidify RIL's position as the largest organised retailer in India and further diversify its earnings,"" Moody's had said last year when RIL was set to acquire the Future Group's buisness for nearly Rs 25,000 crore.
As India's economy grows and per capita incomes rise across segments, organised retail is a promising sector with a huge growth potential as penetration of organised retail is still very low. That's why Future Group with its vast organised retail footprint is an attractive asset, especially for RIL which can find synergies between the acquired and its own retail businesses.

Discounts offered on inflated prices on e-commerce must be curbed by govt: CUTS International,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/discounts-offered-on-inflated-prices-on-e-commerce-must-be-curbed-by-govt-cuts-international/articleshow/104778525.cms,28-10-2023,"The government and relevant regulatory bodies need to take immediate action to curb unethical practices such as offering discounts on inflated prices in the
e-commerce
sector, think tank
CUTS International
suggested in its report released on Saturday. It said that the practice deceives consumers by creating a false perception of savings while the prices are actually higher.
It also said that instead of putting an outright ban on
flash sales
, the government should focus on strengthening consumer protection measures and ensuring a level-playing field for all market participants.
""It is essential for the government and relevant regulatory bodies to take immediate action to curb unethical practices such as offering discounts on inflated prices in the e-commerce sector,"" said the report titled 'Status of commerce in India: Evaluating Consumer Welfare of e-consumers'.
To promote a fair and sustainable e-commerce ecosystem, it is crucial that
sellers
have the autonomy to determine the pricing of their products.
""Imposing extra discount burdens on sellers can lead to financial strain, erode their profit margins, and undermine their ability to offer competitive prices,"" the report said, adding, there is a need for a clarification to differentiate between 'deep discounting' and 'predatory pricing'.

At present, both terms are often used interchangeably, which can lead to confusion and incorrect categorisation of pricing practices in the e-commerce sector.
""It is crucial for
policymakers
, regulators, and industry stakeholders to establish clear definitions and guidelines that distinguish between these two concepts,"" it said.
Further, it said that to uphold consumer welfare and promote a level-playing field for all sellers, it is recommended that e-commerce platforms refrain from engaging in practices such as self-preferencing in terms of 'search and ranking' of products/sellers and maintain platform neutrality.
It also suggested the online retail players to offer content and interfaces in regional languages to expand reach and engage with a larger segment of the population.

"Premiumisation trend: Consumers are no more enticed by entry-level cars, TVs and phones",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/premiumisation-trend-consumers-are-no-more-enticed-by-entry-level-cars-tvs-and-phones/articleshow/104767742.cms,28-10-2023,"Mumbai: The Indian consumer’s swift climb up the luxury ladder is evident in the near-halving of market share for entry-level cars, television sets, home appliances and mobile phones over the past three years, underscoring the role easy financing has played in elevating
purchasing power
.
Separately, manufacturers have also shifted their attention to marketing premium products that offer better profit margins, industry experts said. Most budget models in electronics have moved to ecommerce platforms.
Online platforms have the cost structure to offer bigger discounts.
The premiumisation gradient is the most visible in personal mobility choices. Once the mainstay of the car industry, the share of small cars in the overall pie is shrinking rapidly, even as stocks of companies such as
Maruti Suzuki India
hit lifetime highs.
Lower priced vehicles, which earlier accounted for 85% of the market, now have a 58% share, said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director, Maruti Suzuki, leader of the domestic car market.

“In recent years, several reasons — including regulatory stringency — have led to price increases at the entry level,” said Srivastava. “The income level of buyers in this segment has not gone up proportionately, thus lowering affordability and leading to a drop in sales.""
EMI
Magic
This trend is evident in other pockets of the consumer economy, too. Corporates say the landscape is changing, buttressed by aspirations and lucrative finance packages for those that have the wherewithal to buy high-margin and premium products — at least when assisted by the facility of staggered payments.
“There are no profit margins in the heavily discounted low-end segments, and we find it profitable to shift the consumer by upgrading them to a higher end product through a comfortable EMI package,” said a highly placed executive at a top retail chain, on the condition of anonymity. “Consumers walk into showrooms looking for an affordable brand but are converted quickly by the lure of easy EMIs and a better product — be it a phone, laptop, AC, television, or even a car.”
This executive also said several manufacturers are supplying entry-level products only to ecommerce platforms. “Many companies have stopped production of low-end
brands
for offline retail and these are only sold on
Amazon
or
Flipkart
,” said the executive. “Making an upgrade affordable through EMIs has been a big leverage for companies such as
Apple
, which saw strong sales for each one of its models.""
Apart from lower affordability for entry-level products, the pandemic caused a hard reset of consumer purchases in favour of high-end products. Staying at home and curbs on mobility fuelled purchases of 55-inch television sets, heavy duty washing machines and large-capacity refrigerators, said the head of a large appliances retail chain.
More expensive components or their shortage as well as currency depreciation have also purred a rise in prices at the entry level. Industry officials say smartphones priced under Rs 10,000 may soon be unavailable, in the industry's quest for premiumisation.
Samsung, for instance, markets its fold and flip phones and the Galaxy S23 series offline, while the M series and F series priced lower are only available on Amazon and Flipkart.
In the entry-level segment, a smartphone priced at Rs 5,991 in 2018 now costs Rs 7,126, data from Counterpoint Research showed.
Retailers, too, said margins are lower for entry-level products, making it unviable for them to allocate greater shelf space to such items.
""Attractive EMIs are helping consumers upgrade to higher end products. In the case of entry-level products, EMIs are not that attractive,” said Nilesh Gupta, director, Vijay Sales, which has electronics stores pan-India.
In 2021, the entry-level (sub-Rs 10,000) smartphone segment accounted for 35% of the market. It fell to 30% in the eight months to August this year. The premium segment, above Rs 30,000 a unit, accounted for 8% back then, and has climbed to 17% in the same period, Counterpoint Research data showed.
Shrinking Road Presence
Similarly, the below-Rs 5 lakh car segment has shrunk to less than 1% of the total car market. The under-Rs 10 lakh car segment now accounts for 54% of the market, from 87.5% three years ago. Likewise, the share of smartphones in the sub-Rs 8,000 category has come down to 12%, from 36% in 2018.
For passenger vehicles, quarterly sales of entry-level cars dropped to about 35,000 units — the lowest for the September quarter over the past few years. By contrast, the overall passenger vehicle segment expanded to its highest domestic sales during the period, with more than 1 million units.
In the two-wheeler segment, entry-level motorcycles up to 110 cc posted the lowest ever sales in the past few years in the second quarter — at about 1.4 million units.
Entry-level scooters up to 125 cc remained at about 1.4 million units, while overall two-wheeler sales were at 4.6 million units. These trail the sales posted in the second quarter of 2016-17 — of about 5 million units — said Rajesh Menon, director general, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
“The entry-level two-wheeler segment has dropped significantly due to the increase in the cost of vehicles for meeting new regulations and the mandatory requirement to purchase upfront five-year third party insurance,” said R Dinesh, president, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).
Given India’s demographic pyramid and world-leading economic growth credentials, several first-time buyers of cars should emerge shortly, potentially helping revive action at the entry level, said Maruti Suzuki’s Srivastava.

NCLT admits personal insolvency application against Kishore Biyani,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/nclt-admits-personal-insolvency-application-against-kishore-biyani/articleshow/104764398.cms,28-10-2023,"Mumbai: Mumbai's bankruptcy court on Friday admitted Axis Trustee Services' application to initiate a personal insolvency process against
Future Group
promoter,
Kishore Biyani
, said people aware of the development.
The admission of the application by the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) ensures moratorium on transactions of personal assets of the guarantor. But it does not give the resolution professional (RP) the right to take control of the personal assets of the guarantor.
Following the ruling, the RP will invite claims from lenders and also validate them.
After perusing the RP's report, the tribunal will decide whether to admit or reject
Axis Trustee's application
to proceed against Biyani.
Axis Trustee Services had on July 11 moved the tribunal through Vikram Trivedi, managing partner of law firm Manilal Kher Ambalal & Co., to recover about ₹600 crore under the personal guarantee clause of the bankruptcy law.

The division bench of judicial member Kishore Vemulapalli and technical member Anu Jagmohan Singh admitted Axis Trustee Services' application in an oral order. A detailed order was not uploaded till the time of filing the story.
""Apart from Axis Trustee Services, other lenders, including Catalyst Trusteeship, had also moved to the court with a similar petition; however, now all other petitions will become infructuous,"" said a person involved in the case.
The trustee company had argued that Biyani had personally guaranteed loans taken by some of the group companies, currently undergoing insolvency proceedings, which now the trustee company is trying to recover on behalf of lenders.
Future Retail
,
Future Enterprises
,
Future Supply Chain Solutions
, and
Future Lifestyle Fashions
are among the key companies promoted by Biyani that are undergoing a corporate insolvency process.
""Any creditor or debtor himself can approach the NCLT for initiation of personal insolvency resolution process. If a creditor files, then either it can file it on its own or through a resolution professional. On filing of the application, the interim moratorium starts which puts a restriction on continuation of legal action and creditors cannot initiate any legal action against the corporate debtor,"" said Ashish Pyasi, partner at Aendri Legal.
""After filing of the application, in the first stage, the NCLT appoints IRP for submitting his report recommending for approval or rejection of the petition. Second stage is admission or rejection of the petition based on recommendation of the IRP.""
Even as the provision of IBC permits lenders to recover dues from promoters by invoking personal guarantees, there is negligible recovery so far.
This is primarily because most promoters have moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the law. The matter is pending before the apex court.

E-commerce cos are deploying 'dark patterns' to influence your choices. What is it?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/e-commerce-cos-are-deploying-dark-patterns-to-influence-your-choices-what-is-it/articleshow/104752076.cms,27-10-2023,"The
government
is keen to curb the menace of ‘dark patterns’ employed by digital commerce companies to subtly trick consumers to make certain choices. The Department of Consumer Affairs on Thursday launched ‘Dark Patterns Buster Hackathon 2023’ to help create software solutions to detect
dark patterns
on e-commerce platforms. In September 2023, it had brought out detailed guidelines defining tactics that can be considered dark patterns.
What are dark patterns?
Dark patterns are essentially deceptive user-interface practices crafted by digital commerce companies and online advertisers to manipulate users to make choices or do things that may not be in their interests but benefits the company implementing it.
The draft guidelines issued by the consumer affairs department identify the following as dark patterns:
False urgency: Portraying that a product is in limited supply and a customer would miss out on a big opportunity by not buying it or taking the deal.
Basket sneaking: Adding products to a customer’s cart before checkout without obtaining their consent.

Nagging: Bombarding users with requests that are not related to why they are using a platform, such as asking you to download their mobile app again and again even if you keep closing the pop-up.
Confirm shaming: This occurs when a platform uses guilt to make you buy something or keep a subscription.
Forced action: When a platform makes you do extra things, like buying another product, to get what you originally wanted.
Subscription trap: Makes cancelling a paid subscription hard or requires payment info for a free trial.
Interface interference: Changes the design to manipulate your actions.
Bait and switch: Promises one thing but delivers something else.
Drip pricing: When a platform doesn’t show the full price upfront. It covers advertising something as free but making you buy more.
Disguised advertisement: Hides ads as different types of content – like pretending an ad is a user’s post or a news article.
Why does the government want to curb dark patterns?
According to the Department of Consumer Affairs, such practices are unfair trade practices and are detrimental to consumers’ interests.
They are designed to mislead users to do something they originally don’t intend or want to do by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, amounting to misleading advertisement, unfair trade practice, or violation of consumer rights.
What is the government trying to do about it?
The consumer affairs department came out with draft guidelines that propose prohibitions against engaging in dark patterns. These were put in the public domain for consultation. The objective is to clearly identify and define tactics as dark patterns so that the
Ministry of Consumer Affairs
can act against platforms indulging in this under Section 18 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.
The draft guidelines, once notified, shall apply to all platforms systematically offering goods or services in India, advertisers, and sellers.
The department,
in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (BHU)
Varanasi
, has announced a hackathon for students to design software plug-ins that will detect dark patterns used by ecommerce websites and will alert consumers about these detrimental practices.
This software can be browser extension, plug-ins, mobile apps, and add-ons that will keep a check and vigil for the user.
How will these guidelines affect businesses?
The guidelines, if notified, can have a big impact on public and private businesses across D2C businesses, e-commerce, and financial services, including new-age fintechs and banks, according to experts from the startup world.
Some industry groups have said that such guidelines may stagnate the growth of the country’s digital economy and urged the government to consider the current self-regulatory framework as the primary measure to restrict the use of dark patterns. They also argued that online platforms are already regulated in the country under various existing laws.

""This will be one of the largest jewellery stores in the country, and Titan already has a store of about 10,000 sq ft across the road,"" said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified. ""The average rent in the area ranges between Rs 500-600 per sq ft per month.""
Titan as well as international property consultant Cushman & Wakefield, which acted as adviser for the deal, declined to comment.
The organised jewellery retail segment is growing faster than other consumer discretionary segments since April with buyers shifting away from smaller jewellers.
According to ICICI Securities, in the medium term, the jewellery segment can outperform other segments as it is relatively immune to general economic slowdown owing to factors including inelastic wedding purchases.
""Titan highlighted double-digit growth in buyers and ticket sizes. However, Titan continued investments in exchange programmes and consumer offers which helped maintain its momentum, implying pressure on margins,"" it added.
The company reported a 20% increase in its domestic jewellery sales in the July-September quarter from a year earlier.
In September, the jewellery segment grew 13% year-on-year, faster than the overall retail sector which expanded 9% but just short of quick-service restaurants (14%) and food and grocery (14%), according to the
Retailers Association of India
data.
Titan added 10
Tanishq
stores in the July-September quarter. Tanishq also expanded its presence in West Asia by entering Qatar, opening two new boutiques in Doha. It also opened 26 stores of
Mia
by Tanishq and one store of Zoya. Tanishq has 436 stores at present and plans to increase the number to 470 by the end of this financial year.
During the third quarter of 2023, the Delhi-National Capital Region witnessed 450,000 sq ft retail space uptake across malls and markets, an increase of 34% quarter-on-quarter and 30% year-on-year.

As per the filings, the major revenue contributors are grocery food and staples at 53% of the sales, followed by grocery non-food at 22% and fresh products at 19%.
""More Retail's revenue has witnessed a decline, while operational costs have surged, intensifying the company's financial strain,"" said Mohit Yadav, founder of business intelligence firm AltInfo.
""The major chunk of expenditure is allocated towards inventory, underscoring the imperative need for bolstered margins to ensure the company's sustained growth,"" he said.
The filings also show More Retail entered related-party transactions with various
Amazon
entities in
India
in FY23. This includes transactions worth Rs 44 crore with
Amazon Retail India
, which includes purchase of fruits and vegetables worth Rs 2.3 crore.
The rest are B2B sales. There are also transactions with Amazon Seller Services and Amazon Pay India, such as commission on orders placed, commission on payments made through Amazon Pay and promotion discount recovery.
More Retail in the filings said it has chalked out a profitable growth strategy driven by the rollout of its own e-commerce in supermarkets and hypermarkets, rapid expansion plans in current and new markets, sustainable operating model with strong backend support, and tight control on margin earnings and overhead costs.

"India 'priority market', M&S accelerates store expansion",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-priority-market-ms-accelerates-store-expansion/articleshow/104736316.cms,26-10-2023,"British retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S) said it is opening a store every month in India, accelerating their outlet expansion though a quarter of their sales comes from online channels.
India
is already its largest international market outside home in terms of store network with 100 stores opened in the last 15 years.
""If you just look at the market, whether there are customers to buy M&S there's disposable income, there is enough macro and opportunity at play here. Because of where the Indian economy is, the country is bound to be a priority market,"" said
Ritesh Mishra
, India MD at M&S, which operates in the country through a joint venture with
Mukesh Ambani
's
Reliance Retail
.
The plan is to take their retail space from 1.1 million square feet now to 1.4 million sq ft by end of the year. ""We are already in about 36 cities. And even within those cities, there's far more opportunities for us to do a bit more. So, as and when we get the right real estate, right malls, right locations, etc, we want to open more and more stores,"" he added.
M&S, a mainstay of the UK high street, has been trying to appeal to younger shoppers globally and announced an overhaul of its stores to expand its brick and mortar presence to build a more resilient business and focus on quality merchandise. Also, companies such as Levi's, Uniqlo and Celio are increasingly getting popular for functional basics like T-shirts and jeans, unlike fast-fashion rivals that are associated with designs that move quickly from the catwalk to the showroom.
Live Events
However, bargain-hunting cash-squeezed Indian consumers still largely perceive M&S as pricey compared to local brands like
Zudio
and global fast-fashion labels such as
Zara
and H&M.
""I think fast fashion is an overrated word. We stand for quality and elevated style essentials. Linen is one very essential category, swimwear is another. These are our strengths and we will back it up. And in India, if you have more colour, you are in fashion. So, we drive those credentials,"" said
Mishra
, who was previously head of operations and property at the UK-based clothing retailer.
Over the past few years, India has seen a clutch of the world's largest apparel brands open outlets betting on young consumers increasingly embracing western-style clothing. Over the past few quarters, most apparel retailers have seen growth tapering off as shoppers cut back on discretionary spends.
For M&S, women consumers contribute 60% to the revenue and a bulk of its overall sales are in winter months.
The company said the current festive period will be a testing ground for them as the winter period is extremely crucial.
""I'm actually quite buoyant about this festive period...."" said Mishra.

Retail sales grows by 9% in September 2023,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-sales-grows-by-9-in-september-2023/articleshow/104721194.cms,26-10-2023,"Retail sales in September 2023 showed a growth of 9% as compared to the sales levels during the same period in September 2022, according to the survey by
Retailers Association of India

Retail businesses across regions have indicated growth in sales as compared to September 2022 sales level.
Pan-India
saw a 9% increase in sales growth, with the Southern region of the country witnessing an overall 13% year-on-year growth. While West India indicated a growth of 8% followed by
East India
and North India signalling a growth of 7% & 6% respectively.
“Retailers witnessed a growth of 9% in the month of September 2023. Festive season definitely rings in positivity. As we approach Diwali, there’s an anticipation of an upstick in purchases, especially of celebrational items. Retailers are betting big on the season to drive growth,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI).
The double-digit growth of
South India
could be attributed to new store and expansion during September 2023.
In categories,
QSR
reported a growth of 15%. While food & grocery and sports goods signaled a growth of 14% each followed by jewellery (13%) as compared to sales levels in September 2022. Cricket season is also helping sports goods sales.

Decathlon FY23 sales shoot up 37% in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/decathlon-fy23-sales-shoot-up-37-in-india/articleshow/104707656.cms,26-10-2023,"Surging demand for fitness wear and sports equipment for disciplines other than cricket and football helped
Decathlon
's India unit expand sales 37% to Rs 3,955 crore in FY23. With more than 100 large, warehouse-like stores selling products catering to 85 sporting disciplines, the French company is bigger than
Adidas
,
Nike
and Asics all put together in India.
In FY22, sales were Rs 2,936 crore, according to its latest filings with the Registrar of Companies. The retailer, however, posted a net loss of Rs 18.6 crore during the year ended March 2023 compared to a net profit of Rs 36 crore a year ago.
Experts said a host of factors - from pricing products about 30-40% lower than competing products to selling everything from running shoes, athleisure wear to mountaineering equipment under its own brands - has worked in its favour. ""They have an extremely powerful format across different sporting activities and have something for both active and casual wear shoppers. For them, the market is still under penetrated with the kind of comprehensive product range they sell for outdoor sports beyond shoes and clothing,"" said Devangshu Dutta, founder of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight. ""Even their front end staff seem to have a strong domain knowledge about products compared to rival brands.""
By selling only private labels, Decathlon, the world's biggest
sporting goods
firm, controls almost every bit of operations, from pricing and design to distribution, and keeps costs and selling prices low.
Decathlon uses a combination of in-house manufacturing and outsourcing to stock its shelves. In fact, it sources nearly 15% of its global requirement from India across sporting goods. And nearly all of its cricket merchandise sold globally is designed and made in India.

Why retail stores still charge customers for carry bags despite courts deeming it unfair & illegal?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/why-retail-stores-still-charge-customers-for-carry-bags-despite-courts-deeming-it-unfair-illegal/articleshow/104695318.cms,25-10-2023,"In a recent ruling, a consumer court in Delhi has ordered
Reliance Trends
to pay a fine of Rs 3,000 for charging a customer Rs 7 for a carry bag. The court dismissed the firm's argument that the complainant's case lacked a valid cause of action and appeared to be a mere attempt to seek financial gain.
Reliance
Trends maintained that the purchase of the
carry bag
was optional, and customers were not obligated to buy one. The company stated that the consumer had willingly chosen to purchase the bag and was billed accordingly, a TOI report stated.
This incident is not an isolated case. On October 4, a consumer court in Bengaluru fined furniture brand Ikea Rs 3,000 for charging Rs 20 for a carry bag. Despite numerous consumer court rulings against this practice, charging for
carry bags
remains widespread. Many individuals have voiced their concerns about this additional expense when making purchases. Rhea Anand, a 21-year-old MNC executive, expressed her frustration, saying, ""I was charged Rs 10 for a gift bag at the DIY store in Kamla Nagar. They don't provide any other bags except gift bags."" Mehfooz Alam, a 37-year-old resident of East Delhi, stated, ""Charging for a carry bag is wrong and should be stopped. I have been bringing my own bag for years now.""
Legal experts argue that this practice is both unfair and illegal. However, due to the lengthy legal process, the resolution of such cases can take up to four years, providing no credible deterrence. Sanjay Sharma, a practicing advocate in Delhi, highlighted that brands, retailers, or shopkeepers cannot charge consumers for plastic, paper, or cloth carry bags with their logos. He emphasized that brands should not treat consumers as their advertisement agents and should not use ignorance of the law as an excuse.
Rule 15 of the Plastic Waste Management (Amended) Rules, 2018, which specifically addressed the pricing of plastic bags, has been omitted. Consequently, vendors and retailers are not permitted to impose a price on bags. If any brand violates this rule, consumers have the right to file a complaint in a consumer forum under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, for unfair trade practices.
Additionally, if brands wish to charge consumers for carry bags, they are only allowed to do so for unbranded bags. However, this must be done with prior intimation and consent from the consumer, and the information must be clearly displayed in prominent areas within the premises.
Live Events
Manisha Bhandari, an advocate practicing in Delhi High Court and Supreme Court, shared her experiences, stating, ""Every time I go shopping, I have to fight against being charged for carry bags. Now, I bring my own. This issue should be included in the school curriculum to raise awareness among the next generation.""
Some brands have claimed that they do not charge for carry bags that bear their brand name. Devarajan Iyer, executive director and CEO of Lifestyle, stated, ""We abide by the spirit of the law and have stopped charging for carry bags. Our brand prioritizes sustainability, so we only provide paper bags.""
According to legal experts, the practice of charging for carry bags began in 2011 when the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests introduced the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules. These rules mandated that retailers could no longer provide plastic carry bags free of cost to consumers. As a result, retailers began charging for paper and cloth bags.
A lawyer, who preferred to remain anonymous, expressed concern about the burden on consumer courts, noting that it often takes years to reach a resolution. ""To address this issue, we need credible deterrence in the form of severe penalties,"" the lawyer added.

Why is Tata Group raising its bet on its super app Tata Neu?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/why-is-tata-group-raising-its-bet-on-its-super-app-tata-neu/articleshow/104695246.cms,25-10-2023,"Trust the business house that started out with a textile mill and expanded to steel, hotels, aviation, automobiles, tea and salt, energy, communication, electronics and software, to test ever new boundaries. The latest for the
Tata Group
is on digital retail where it is trying to tap into India's fast growing e-commerce space with its
super app
called
Tata
Neu. Tata Digital, which runs
Tata Neu
, might get $1 billion of fresh capital as the conglomerate seeks to improve its digital business, ET has reported based on information from people familiar with the matter.
The $1 billion injection will be on top of the $2 billion that Tata Group invested in the venture earlier this year, the sources told ET, asking not to be identified discussing information that is private. Tata Digital will receive the new funding in the coming year should a deal proceed. A representative for Tata Group declined to comment on the matter. Deliberations are ongoing and details of the capital injection could still change.
The fresh investment will go into, among other things, streamlining the app which has faced glitches in its first year of operation. Tata Neu was launched last year in April to bring together grocery-to-hotel-to-airline ticket booking and medicine on a single platform. Hence, the name, super app.
Why Tata is raising its bet on the super app
Super apps, or ""everything apps"", are often likened to Swiss army knives which can be put to a large number of different uses. These apps offer diverse services to users such as messaging, social networking, food delivery, payments, loans, shopping, flight and hotel bookings, ride hailing, etc. WeChat and Grab are Asian examples of a super app which is not found in Europe or the US.
Live Events
For a super app, what is considered an advantage can be its disadvantage as well. While super apps sell everything to offer a complete shopping experience, they run the risk of ending up as a jack of all trades and masters of none because consumers might prefer specialised shopping. They might prefer to go to the apps that sell only air tickets instead of the app that sells food, clothes and insurance as well as air tickets.
So, why is the Tata Group spending so much on its super app?
The reported plans to inject $1 billion more into Tata Neu underline the group's desire to be a dominant player in a new-age sector. That's why the super app has been conceived and steered by big names. The project was closely overseen by Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of the main holding company Tata Sons, who has been championing the digitization drive in the group. Pratik Pal, the CEO at Tata Digital, has helped with digital transformation at some of the world’s largest retail chains including Walmart, Tesco Plc, Target Corp., Best Buy Co. and Marks & Spencer Group Plc.
Behind such a forceful push by Tata is the vast promise of the digital consumer sector. The group, which owns a line-up of leading consumer brands and has bought a few in recent years such as BigBasket and 1mg, wants to leverage the diversity of its products and services to lure buyers in a country of almost 1.4 billion people, who are increasingly shopping online. India’s e-retail segment is expected to be worth as much as $140 billion by March 2026, Bain & Co. estimates, and is the only large consumer market still open to foreign companies, making it a prize fight for global and local retail firms. Moreover, since India is a developing digital market, where big swathes of new consumers are taking to e-commerce, a super app has lower risk of being rejected for sector-specific apps.
In a super-happening e-commerce space with thousands of apps selling one thing or the other, super apps are believed to continuously capture attention of consumers by becoming a vital part of their daily lives since they sell anything from food to insurance to taxi rides to air tickets.
What's with Tata Neu?
Tata Neu, India’s first super app, aims to offer a complete online shopping experience — you can style up their wardrobe with Tata CLiQ and Westside; purchase the latest gadgets from Croma; order groceries from Bigbasket; Book a flight on AirAsia India; get health checkups through Tata 1mg; book a luxurious stay at an IHCL hotel; and order a 5-star meal on Qmin. More inhouse brands are being added to the super app. The app also offers membership service, reward programme called Neu Coins and financial products such as bill payments, loans and insurance.
Tata Neu has been modeled on China’s ubiquitous Alipay owned by Alibaba group and WeChat owned by Tencent Holdings, but it ran into technical glitches and customer complaints soon after its launch last year.
Tata Neu has had a rather slow beginning. It had a muted start in its first year of operations, ET had reported in March based on information from sources. The app contributed less than 10% of gross sales to Tata’s two biggest digital assets — egrocer BigBasket and epharmacy 1mg — since launch last April, they said. “About 80% of transactions on Tata Neu were driven by grocery and epharmacy,” said one person close to the development. This was “to get the user to spend time on the app. It was part of the first-year objective,” said the person.
A person aware of the matter had told ET that Tata Group recognised that “the superapp hasn’t taken off as per the initial plan.” The person said the overall adoption had been low for Neu so far, resulting in lower number of new or existing users transacting for various Tata products and services. Tata Group’s ecommerce team had gone back to the drawing board to revamp the super app.
Now with the plans for a fresh capital injection of $1 billion into the super app, it's clear Tata Group is ambitiously pursuing its super app plans. A big reason is the competition from other players. A first-mover in the super app business, the group would want to develop a lead over others.
The battle of super apps
Tata Neu is expected to give more firepower to the Indian conglomerate against entrenched rivals such as Amazon, Mukesh Ambani’s
Reliance
and Walmart-owned Flipkart. Add to that Adani's foray into super apps. Last year, Adani launched a superapp, Adani One, to offer varied consumer services, including those from his own airport management business. Adani One connects passengers at Adani’s network of airports with other services offered by his group. It offers booking for flights and cabs, shopping for duty-free products, information about flight status, etc.
Reliance Industries, which has taken the digital retail segment by storm by buying a large array of big and small consumer brands, is also looking to roll out its own super app. Its communication and digital businesses spew out tonnes of consumer data which gives it an edge in e-commerce. Ambani is India's top retailer and has access to 428 million telecom users, through his Jio mobile network. Now it has stepped into the financial services business as well.
Since super apps are the battleground for big conglomerates that have a large number of their own diverse products and services to sell, they will be the locus of India's next big business wars. But given the humongous scale of India's digital consumer market, there could be space enough for a few big players.
“If Ambani wants to spawn India’s Tencent, Ratan Tata can aim to launch its Alibaba,"" columnist Andy Mukherjee has written. ""The conglomerate, which owns Tetley tea and Jaguar Land Rover car brands, has its tentacles in more than 100 businesses, all with their supply chains. If Tata can provide a portal to its vendors to sell their wares, host data and discount bills, expansion into business-to-consumer or consumer-to-consumer websites — like Alibaba’s Tmall or Taobao — shouldn’t be too hard.”

"Consumer spending on cars, smartphones, TVs and other big-ticket items lights up festive sales in first leg",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/consumer-spending-on-cars-smartphones-tvs-and-other-big-ticket-items-light-up-festive-sales-in-first-leg/articleshow/104683897.cms,25-10-2023,"Kolkata | Mumbai: Discretionary spending by consumers on big-ticket items such as cars, smartphones, televisions, two-wheelers and household appliances is off to a flying start this festive season. Several brands and categories have overtaken last year's total festive period sales or are close to matching them in the first phase, which runs from
Navratri
to Dussehra, several industry executives said.
The first phase accounts for 40-50% of total
festive sales
. The second phase begins a week before Diwali, which is on November 12 this year. This surge reflects a revival in consumer sentiment, which has been subdued for over a year.
While ecommerce marketplaces such as Amazon, Flipkart and
JioMart
started their festive sales earlier than usual, during the shraadh period, sales were not impacted at offline stores. They in fact picked up in the Navratri-Dussehra period.
Also, adequate supplies of cars - which had impacted business in the last two years - helped the industry notch record sales.
Mobile phone market tracker Counterpoint Research estimates
smartphone sales
volumes have already grown 4-5% this month from the year earlier. The market has expanded by over 20% in value, said research director Tarun Pathak. Last year, Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali were celebrated in October.

""The recovery in sales is driven by models priced Rs 15,000 and above with a very strong trend in premiumisation,"" said Pathak.
Television makers said there is already a shortage of large-screen models of 65 inches and above.
LG India had expected growth at two-three times last year's levels, said Gireesan Gopi, business head, home entertainment.
""But the combination of festive season and cricket world cup boosted sales beyond expectations,"" he said. ""We are arranging for fresh stock of large-screen televisions on a war footing.""
Car sales
Car sales have grown nearly 16% thus far this month from October last year, while that of two-wheelers is up 20%, indicating a recovery in demand, auto industry executives said.
Better stock levels at dealerships and healthy demand are spurring vehicle sales on an already high base, said industry insiders. As many as 1.57 million two-wheelers and 328,000 passenger vehicles were sold in October 2022.
Car market leader
Maruti Suzuki India
's dealers delivered over 100,000 cars in the nine-day Navratri period while the industry is estimated to have delivered 220,000 units in the same period, said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer, Maruti.
Hyundai
Motor India, the second-largest carmaker by sales volume, saw dealerships deliver 30,000 cars during the Navratri-Dussehra period, said Tarun Garg, chief operating officer.
""This is consistent with year-to-date growth so far,"" he said. ""Exter, Venue and Creta continue to receive overwhelming customer response.""
The inventory level at Hyundai dealers is at 20-25 days, which is optimal, keeping in view the upcoming Dhanteras and Diwali festivals, he said.
The industry expects the momentum to continue in the second leg of the festive season.
However, the stress on the entry level of the car market was pronounced, with steep discounts and attractive offers.
Manish Raj Singhania, president, Federation of Automobile Dealers Association, said two-wheelers are doing particularly well, albeit on a lower base when compared with passenger cars.
Dussehra is the second-largest sales period for high-ticket items after Dhanteras.
The industry expects rural demand for discretionary products - which has been muted - to pick up from next month.
""Agricultural money should reach farmers by then and marriage season will also boost demand next month,"" said Satish NS, president at Haier India. He said the company has already surpassed last year's entire festive season business by 20% this month.

'83% consumers not happy with convenience fees they pay online',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/83-consumers-not-happy-with-convenience-fees-they-pay-online/articleshow/104680588.cms,24-10-2023,"Around 83 % of consumers disapprovingly pay convenience fees
online platforms
for booking tickets or any other service, online survey firm LocalCircles said on Tuesday.
According to the survey, 84%of respondents want the government and its public sector units (PSUs) like
IRCTC
to stop charging
convenience fees
or service charges and promote
Digital India
. LocalCircles claims to have received over 32,000 responses from consumers in 319 districts of
India
in response to the survey conducted between June 16 and October 19, while the number of feedback to each question varied.
""On an aggregate basis, 79% of consumers surveyed claim they are being charged convenience fees for services they have booked online,"" the survey said.
According to the report on convenience fees, when services like tickets are procured digitally, the supplier or seller is able to lower the cost of manpower and facilities and instead spend more on the deployment of user interfaces and backend servers.
""However, despite the net cost savings, most platforms, whether selling movie or sports tickets, railway tickets or airline seats are levying this convenience, internet handling or service fee, which is beyond comprehension for most consumers,"" the report said.

According to the survey, some consumers also cited the example of

payments where no charges are being levied.
Consumers want similar practices to be adopted by other central government bodies, PSUs and state government units.
The survey found that 10 per cent of consumers ""happily pay"" convenience fees as they don't have to stand in a queue, 5% prefer to stand in a queue, but 83 % ""pay disapprovingly"" and 2 % gave no clear response.
""The survey finds that 79 per cent of the consumers who buy services or tickets online are fed up with excessive convenience fees being levied by platforms.

Content creators replenishing household supplies in fancy containers is gaining eyeballs in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/content-creators-replenishing-household-supplies-in-fancy-containers-is-gaining-eyeballs-in-india/articleshow/104614274.cms,21-10-2023,"Do you own rose-shaped ice trays for keeping ice cubes gleaming with fruit slices and edible glitter, or are you normal? A section of the internet is swooning over videos of people making 27 types of
artisanal ice cubes
, emptying the ice trays and stocking those pretty ice cubes in fancy containers inside the freezer. These videos are part of a popular content genre called “restocking”. Here, content creators “aesthetically” replenish household supplies in their fridge, cupboards, snack drawers, laundry, pantry, the works. Through these videos, they endorse a range of home-organisation products, either subtly or through direct affiliate links, contributing to a global market worth $12 billion, as per a recent report from the market research store Research and Markets.
Restocking videos
have gained traction in India of late, two years after it became a legitimate content genre in the US. Since October 2020, the interest in restocking on
YouTube
in India went from negligible to the maximum score of 100 in the last week of December 2022, as per Google Trends. Creators from India, particularly in sectors such as food and lifestyle, frequently share restocking videos in regional languages on YouTube.
In these videos, they promote homeorganising products like labelled jars for kitchen and bathroom supplies, and other showy items to store household goods. Their cost ranges from Rs 500 to Rs 50,000. The pandemic-led push for work from home is believed to be a key reason for the spurt in interest for home-organising products. Home organisation forms a growing part of the $22 billion home-improvement and renovation market in India, as per a 2022 report from Mordor Intelligence, a global market research company
Most restocking videos are low on verbal input and rely heavily on arresting visuals and the atmospheric sounds of rustling packages and of items being poured into containers and gentle finger-tapping. This puts them in the category of ASMR content. For the uninitiated, ASMR is ‘autonomous sensory meridian response’, or a tingling feeling, triggered by certain audio-visual stimuli.

Vaishnavi Prasad discovered restocking Reels on Instagram while looking for ASMR content. “I like symmetry and organisation. When I go to stationery stores, I end up rearranging their pens by colour, brand and size,” says the hospitality marketing consultant from Chennai. Even though restocking videos often make her feel like a “disorganised slob”, she admits she finds some of them rather calming.
“The perfection and symmetry in these videos can be oddly satisfying to watch,” says
Sana Dhamija
, 28, a psychiatrist from Pune. She sampled these videos recently when they showed up as “Suggested” in her Instagram feed. “Watching these videos provides momentary relief and calmness, allowing a break from reality where we don’t want to confront our emotions,” says Dhamija. She feels the obsession with these videos could stem from the tendency to look for distractions while dealing with anxiety. She thinks it is similar to finding an escape in “doomscrolling”, where people endlessly browse negative news online. Except, this is more like soothscrolling.
How does this work, exactly? “During moments of anxiety, people often seek control,” says Divya Geryani, 28, a counselling psychologist from Jaipur. She notes that some people try to achieve control by organising things or by simply organising their thoughts in bullet points. “Restocking videos offer a similar satisfaction, allowing viewers to experience a sense of control vicariously,” adds Geryani.
While the consumption of restocking videos is on the rise in India, the trend has failed to produce prominent Indian creators in the genre, unlike in the US where creators such as Kaeli Mae (@kaelimaeee), Micah Enriquez (@makeitwithmicah), Kami Larae (@kami. larae) and Jackie Aina (@lavishlyjackie) are known for their restocking content.
Perhaps the aesthetically pleasing setups of restocking videos look aspirational but do not resonate with the reality of most Indian kitchens and homes, says Geryani. According to data from the National Family Health Survey 2019- 21 (NFHS-5), only 16% of Indian households own all three household appliances television, refrigerator and washing machine. This means the supporting characters in a restocking video are a luxury for most of the Indian population.
“We use old Bournvita containers to store lentils,” says Geryani. Indian households tend to store most packaged items, like snacks, tea, coffee, etc, in their packages and bottles instead of emptying them into fancy-looking jars, she adds. “I have been seeing ads of a dal dispenser online. It tempts initially, but you realise how unfeasible it is as it only stores 500 grams of lentil whereas we buy lentils in kilos because that is cost-effective. Where will I store the rest of the dal?” she asks.
Die-hard fans of the genre are also unable to overlook the excessive consumerism at play in most restocking videos. “Restocking is my current favourite content genre to consume,” says Zahra Khan, a content marketing professional, who posts as @ zahrakhan25 on Instagram.
“The precision stacking, the masterful organisation, the percussive sound”— it has her hooked. That said, “No one needs to stock/restock that many coffee pods or tomatoes unless one is hoarding up for Armageddon,” she adds. Khan discovered restocking content two years ago via The Home Edit, a Netflix reality show.
Prasad from Chennai highlights another problem with these videos: the items, bought in bulk, often spoil quickly. Plus, the storage items they endorse create a lot of plastic waste.

Even the West—which once considered these videos “soothing” and “satisfying”—has begun to question their excessive and wasteful nature. The primary driver of this shift in perception is Shabaz Ali (@shabazsays), a chemistry teacher from England.
Ali creates reaction videos where he mocks people whose social media content includes extravagant displays of wealth and an unattainable lifestyle. In many of these posts, he pretends to speak on their behalf and cheekily addresses the viewers as “povvo,” the Australian slang for an individual with limited financial means. In his reaction videos on the restocking trend, he says restocking creators don’t shop out of necessity. Instead, they base their choices on the shape and size of their restocking jars and storage items.
“Around 12% of my Instagram following [he has 1.6 million followers] is from India,” Ali tells ET over an Instagram DM chat. It includes celebrities like Anushka Sharma and Shweta Bachchan, he adds. India constitutes his fifth largest audience, following the US, the UK, Australia and Canada
Sai Adithya, a Bengaluru-based brand consultant, discovered the restocking genre through Ali’s satirical videos. “Had I discovered restocking videos independently, I would have just enjoyed them as oddly calming videos,” he says. “But Shabaz’s commentary gives you a nuanced understanding of the trend.”
The majority of his audience still views his videos as entertainment, says Ali. “But for some, it’s a way to be proud that they don’t come from much and also to understand that it’s okay to live within your means when the world tells you to ‘try and make more money,’” he says.

"H&M sales expand 40% in FY23, retains position as India’s largest fast fashion brand by revenues",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/hm-sales-expand-40-in-fy23-retains-position-as-indias-largest-fast-fashion-brand-by-revenues/articleshow/104534134.cms,18-10-2023,"Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) posted a 40% increase in sales in the year to March 2023, still managing to retain its position as
India
’s largest
fast fashion
brand by
revenues
on lower pricing.
The sales expansion, however, was lower compared to 49% a year ago, indicating consumer shift to competition including Uniqlo and Zara. H&M posted sales at Rs 2960 crore during 2022-23, up from Rs 2115 crore in the year ago, according to its latest filing with the Registrar of Companies. Net profit surged 72% during the year to Rs43.6 crore.
During the fiscal, H&M's online sales crossed Rs1000 crore mark, becoming one of the largest
apparel brands
online with revenues of Rs 1178 crore from ecommerce business, accounting for about 40% of its overall sales. A new logistics centre for online sales was put into operation in New Delhi in the beginning of the year, H&M said in its annual report recently.
H&M stocks fast fashion items created in-house and teams up with designers for one-time collections. It keeps a large inventory of basic, everyday items sourced from places including India and Bangladesh that carry lower price tags than those of most of its rivals.
Inditex
Trent
, its joint venture with
Tata
that runs 20 Zara stores in India, saw revenue expand 40% to Rs 2562.5 crore last fiscal, but it is six times more profitable than H&M. . Both Zara and H&M have been runaway successes in India since their arrival but Zara's performance has been tapering off due to slow outlet expansion. Stockholm-based H&M, which opened a store a month in India on average since its entry in the country in October 2015, also saw its slowest expansion ever last fiscal when it opened less than five stores.

Sales in the organised retail segment grew 34% during FY22-23 compared to pre-pandemic (FY20), largely driven by quick service restaurants, sporting goods and electronics, according to a report by the
Retailers Association of India
(RAI).
As the world’s second most-populated country, India is an attractive market for apparel brands, especially with youngsters increasingly embracing western-style clothing. Companies such as Levi's, Uniqlo and Celio are increasingly getting popular for functional basics like T-shirts and jeans, unlike fast-fashion rivals which are associated with designs that move quickly from the catwalk to the showroom. Earlier this month, Levi Strauss & Co president Michelle Gass said India is now the largest market for the San Francisco-based jeans maker within Asia and sixth largest globally.

More than 1000 brands saw 20% increase in order volume in the first phase of festive season: GoKwik,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/more-than-1000-brands-saw-20-increase-in-order-volume-in-the-first-phase-of-festive-season-gokwik/articleshow/104462476.cms,16-10-2023,"GoKwik, an
eCommerce
enabler, said over 1000 brands on its network saw a 20% increase in order volume during the first phase of the festive season compared to last year. Despite the surge in orders, the return-to-origin (RTO) rate (non-deliverability of
COD
orders) has come down by 26%, which was attributed to
GoKwik
that helped curb
RTO
losses for these brands.
“We are seeing a remarkable growth in order volumes across categories in our network. Q4 is expected to be even bigger. Fashion brands are spearheading this growth in volume, closely followed by the beauty and personal care category. We are seeing many smaller D2C brands also participating in festive sale events this year riding on the positive consumer sentiments”, said Chirag Taneja, Co-Founder and CEO, GoKwik
Among categories, fashion saw a 148% increase in order volume and shoppers in the GoKwik network had 12.1% higher discounts this festive season compared to last year. The states that contributed the most to the surge in order volume included Maharashtra which accounted for the majority of these orders (12%) followed by
Uttar Pradesh
(7.8%) and Karnataka (7.3%).
The cash on-delivery GMV also increased by almost 40% with the highest contribution from fashion brands. The preference for COD amongst Indian shoppers continues mostly due to lack of trust, especially during the festive period when orders are usually delayed as a result of high demand. Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and Gujarat were the top contributors for COD orders.
“The shoppers are all geared up to make the most of festive season deals that eCommerce brands are offering. As the most important leg of festive season approaches, brands are charged up to double down on their marketing efforts and scale their business during this period. ” added Chirag
Live Events
The average order value increased by 29.4% this season compared to last year. As more GenZs enter the workforce, this number is further expected to see an uplift as the festive season reaches its prime.
GoKwik houses more than 1000 eCommerce brands in its network including Lenskart, Pilgrim, Bombay Shaving Company, Shopper’s Stop, Snitch, Neemans, Mivi etc.

Ecomm festive sales off to a bright start on deep discounts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ecomm-festive-sales-off-to-a-bright-start-on-deep-discounts/articleshow/104449001.cms,16-10-2023,"Ecommerce shopping during the first week of flagship sales has been off to a good start even though it remains to be seen if the trend will hold for another three-four weeks in the run up to Diwali.
Brands and ecommerce platform executives said they have seen a better-than-expected start to festive season sales at the end of the first week, with deep discounts, shaking off concerns around an impact from the 'Shradh' period, which lasted till October 15.
Ecommerce enabler firm
Unicommerce
, which tracks online sales data, said the Indian ecommerce industry reported a more than 30% growth in order volume terms between October 7 and 13. Between October 7 and 14, the e-commerce platforms clocked gross sales of more than $4 billion, an increase of about 18% from the first week of festive sales a year ago, said Satish Meena, an advisor at market researcher Datum Intelligence.
The period of 'Shradh', which fell between September 29 and October 15 this year, is a time when Hindus across many states in India venerate their ancestors-a solemn period when people refrain from making purchases.
""Compared to the first week of the festive period last year, we saw a three times growth in sales,"" said Anurag Kedia, cofounder of beauty and wellness brand
Pilgrim
, which closed a $20 million funding on September 26.

Echoing Kedia, Boldfit founder Pallav Bihani said the healthcare brand posted a 3.5 times sales growth across marketplaces over the same period last year. ""We're seeing some great trends early on compared to a rather dull sale last year,"" he said. Boldfit sells products like health supplements and sports equipment.
For individual brands, depending on the scale, the growth would be much higher compared to large marketplaces who move significant amounts of volume from sellers and brands across the country.
Multiple brands and sellers told ET they are seeing much more activity around advertising and supply-chain preparedness from ecommerce platforms this year compared to last year, and that helped increase overall activity on the platforms.
""Typically, during the festive season, due to the surge in demand, orders that were supposed to get delivered in 24 hours will take 36 hours, and so on. But this year, in spite of the higher base and higher growth, we are seeing much better customer service in terms of deliveries... You can't make these changes overnight, so this is hardcore operational preparation,"" said Kedia.

"Amazon, Flipkart festive offers give a massive push in e-retail sales",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazon-flipkart-festive-offers-give-a-massive-push-in-e-retail-sales/articleshow/104426367.cms,14-10-2023,"According to a survey published by Redseer
Strategy Consultants
on Friday,
e-commerce platforms
are expected to have made over Rs 29,000 crore in sales in the first four days of the festive sale period, indicating that consumers appear to be going all out when it comes to shopping, TOI reported.
Sales increased by 16 per cent as a result compared to the same period last year. On October 8, this year, two of the biggest online retailers,
Flipkart
and
Amazon
, began their annual holiday deals. The platforms' various promotions on high ASP (average selling price) products and simple financing choices like free EMIs contributed to the spike in demand, according to researchers at the consultancy firm.
E-retailers were able to better assess client demand and plan thanks to features like price-lock and pre-book that were provided by platforms. These features allowed customers to lock in pricing of high-value products like electronics before the sale began.
As per Redseer, the first day of the sale was estimated to have seen a seven-fold increase in sales over the usual period, and throughout the course of the four days, daily sales increased by an average of six times. To give an example, in the first 48 hours following the start of the sale event, 9.5 crore users visited Amazon.com. According to the company earlier this week, 75% of clients from tier 2 and tier 3 towns and beyond placed large bets on smartphones.
According to Flipkart's initial data, people are spending money on items like electronics, clothes, appliances, and mobile phones.

""We expect a 30-35% surge in delivery business and are preparing for the sudden order surge during meal times,"" said Anjan Chatterjee, managing director of
Speciality Restaurants
that operates fine-dining restaurant chains such as Mainland China and Oh! Calcutta.
People are organising house parties to watch the India-Pakistan match, he said.
Parle Products' senior category head B Krishna Rao said, ""As compared to a normal weekend day, sales of namkeens and munchies will surge by at least 50% on Saturday, led by quick commerce platforms.""

And everyone is making sure they don't run dry.
Swiggy has strengthened its fleet of delivery partners and is working with restaurant partners to ensure good serviceability to cater to an expected surge in orders on Saturday, its vice president and national business head Sidharth Bhakoo said.
Quick commerce companies, which saw their dark stores become nearly empty in categories like packaged snacks by afternoon during the Asia Cup match between India-Pakistan last month, have ensured at least 50-70% higher inventory levels for Saturday than a usual day.
Sales of televisions have increased 30-40% in one week amid heavy discounting on Amazon and Flipkart during their sales, and now companies are flooded with requests from consumers to install the new sets by Saturday afternoon.

""There is absolute chaos as everybody who has bought a TV set in the online sales wants it delivered and installed by Friday,"" said Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive of online-focused TV manufacturer Super Plastronics, which has the licence for brands like Kodak, Thomson and Blaupunkt.
Super Plastronics installed more than 8,000 televisions on Friday - two times more than what it undertook in the previous few days.
Pubs and multiplexes that will screen the match live are reporting heavy bookings.
""The India versus Pakistan game is not just another match. It's a carnival,"" said Faiz Ali Khan, general manager at The Ministry of Beer. Khan is expecting a footfall of over 250 people on Saturday at the outlet in Delhi's Connaught Place.
Ashish Kapur, promoter of premium bars Whisky Samba and Wine Company, said bookings and reservations at his outlets have peaked out. Saurabh Khanijo, managing director of Kylin chain of restaurants, too, said there are huge bookings for screenings at Kylin Skybar.
Gautam Dutta, co-CEO of multiplex chain PVR-Inox, said thousands of cricket enthusiasts across 40 cities are going to watch the match at the multiplex.
While offices will be mostly closed because it is the second Saturday of the month, some departments like sales and some companies in sectors like ecommerce, startup, real estate, logistics, automobiles and consumer goods will be working as the festive season is round the corner.
Upgrad managing director Mayank Kumar said the edtech unicorn has ordered Team India t-shirts for sales and finance department employees who will be coming into office on the match day, besides arranging large-screen screening and food on the house.
Proptech unicorn NoBroker CEO Amit Agarwal said weekends are typically the busiest times for its business, but the firm will set up big screens and order food so that employees can watch the match in between work.
Logistics technology platform firm Shiprocket is planning a match screening for the customer care and sales team members who will be in office, its HR chief Saumya Khati said.
Most IT, ITeS and consulting firms including
HCL Infosystems
, Accenture and L&T Technology Services follow a five-day work week, so weekends are off. Even those who may need to work have the option of flexible working, so they can work from home, executives said.
Those who don't need to work can check out offers at various eateries and bars that screen the match.
At Cafe Delhi Heights in Delhi, customers can get unlimited beer and cocktails for an hour and a half for Rs 999 and Rs 1,199, respectively, said founder Vikrant Batra. The offer would also be applicable in other cities with a minor price variation.
At The Lalit New Delhi, a special menu is being introduced for the
World Cup
starting Saturday, with dishes ranging from a No Ball Pizza to a Run Out Fish Tikka.
'Cricketing fever' and matches like the India-Pakistan clash are always exciting for F&B brands in India because of the fandom and the craze about the sport, said Vivek Dudani, head of events and programming at 'SOCIAL' and 'antiSOCIAL'
restaurant brands
of Impresario Hospitality.
At its Mumbai outlet, SOCIAL will have a one-plus-one offer on all beverages till 6 pm on Saturday, he said.
Ajay Gowda, director and owner of Byg Brewski Brewing Co, said his outlet in Bengaluru would be doing a screening of Saturday's match on LED walls in both indoor and outdoor spaces. ""The aim is to create an atmosphere of a real, immersive stadium experience,"" he added.

Clicking towards record: India's festival season spurs online shopping spree,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/clicking-towards-record-indias-festival-season-spurs-online-shopping-spree/articleshow/104363766.cms,12-10-2023,"Run off their virtual feet at the start of
India
's
festival season
, e-commerce companies like
Amazon
and Walmart owned
Flipkart
are looking forward to a potentially record breaking few weeks.
Any lingering fears that inflation and higher interest rates would dampen consumers' spirit in Asia's third largest economy, are being rapidly dispelled.
RedSeer
, a Bangalore-based consultancy, which monitors over 100 platforms covering 90% of online sales, predicts virtual shoppers will spend a record $11 billion during the month to mid-November - which would be nearly 20% more than last year.
Amazon India has made its ""best-ever start"" to the peak period in the shopping calendar, according to vice president Manish Tiwary, reporting a record 95 million customer visits in the first two days of its 'Great Indian Festival 2023' campaign.
Over at Flipkart, sales of electronic products, lifestyle garments and furniture were seven to ten times higher than in the pre-festival period, said vice president Arief Mohamad.
Live Events
Both retailers have hired over 200,000 temporary workers to meet the rush and added over 300,000 new sellers, according to company officials.
""I don't have time even for lunch as there are so many packets to be delivered,"" said Ajay Singh, a delivery boy at a Flipkart delivery centre in a busy market in New Delhi.
Singh says he's working more than 12 hours a day and expects to double his earnings over the next few weeks.
CHANGING WAYS
Citing a report by market research Neilson, Amazon officials said over 80% of urban consumers were expected to shop online during this festival season, and half of buyers were willing to spend more compared to last year.
A shift in consumer behaviour and increased penetration of smartphones has fuelled the rise in online buying.
Manju Negi could be speaking for a lot of working women in India with money to spend but little time to spare, and no great desire to travel on jammed roads to and from bustling malls and markets.
""Who would like to go to an overcrowded market and spend hours buying products while paying for transport, when there are so many options on online platforms,"" said Negi, a public relations manager with a company in Delhi. ""We plan to spend more on festival buying compared to last year.""
Negi has already bought a washing machine and an air-fryer online and said she is now looking for home décor items ahead of India's largest festival of Diwali in November.
DELIVERY NETWORKS
The e-commerce firms have also expanded their footprint by organising delivery solutions for more customers living outside India's major metros. ""The fast emerging online business has created opportunities for a number of logistics companies and small sellers - generating jobs for millions,"" said Ashwani Jakhar, CEO of Prozo, a supply-chain management company based in Gurgaon, near Delhi. Commenting on the first 48 hours of the festival sales, Amazon said in a statement that more than 80% of customers came from non-metro cities, and smaller sellers saw a 35% jump in sales compared a year ago.
A report by India's central bank last week showed consumer confidence touched a four-year high in September on the back of stabilising inflation and improving employment conditions.
As consumer spending accounts for 60% of gross domestic product, that would support the
Reserve Bank of India
's forecast for economic growth of 6.5% in the year to March 31, 2024.
Mrigank Gutgutia, partner at RedSeer, expected the improvement in business and consumer sentiment to last, resulting in ""better and stable growth for e-commerce not only this festival season but in the next few years as well.""
The e-commerce market is projected to expand to $350 billion by 2030 from an estimated $63 billion in 2023, according to government estimates.

"Delay in roll-out of e-commerce policy, consumer protection rules damaging domestic retail trade: CAIT",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/delay-in-roll-out-of-e-commerce-policy-consumer-protection-rules-damaging-domestic-retail-trade-cait/articleshow/104338714.cms,11-10-2023,"Traders' body
CAIT
on Wednesday flagged the ""inordinate delay"" in the roll-out of a national
e-commerce policy
and consumer protection rules, saying the delay in their implementation has provided an opportunity to certain foreign e-commerce players to damage domestic retail trade. The
Confederation of All India Traders
(CAIT) sent a written communication in this regard to Minister for Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution and Textiles, Piyush Goyal on Tuesday.
In a statement on Wednesday, the traders' body expressed ""utter dismay over inordinate delay in rolling out of e-commerce policy and rules under Consumer Protection Act"" and equated it to a ""slow poison situation"" for the country's business community.
In the letter to Goyal, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said the delay in the implementation ""has caused irreparable loss to the small and medium retail traders and has resulted in deep loss of turnover in their business and thousands of retail traders have been forced to close down their businesses in addition to wreaking havoc in the lives of all those who are directly and indirectly dependent on India's retail and e-commerce industry"".
He claimed that the traders are unwilling to get on-board e-commerce platforms as they remain uncompetitive with the lack of level-playing field and certain foreign e-commerce players openly flouting norms.
The proposed national e-commerce policy being formulated by the commerce and industry ministry is in the final stages and no new draft policy will be issued now for seeking views of stakeholders, a senior government official said in August.

Earlier the ministry had issued two draft national e-commerce policies. The 2019 draft proposed to address six broad areas of the e-commerce ecosystem -- data, infrastructure development, e-commerce marketplaces, regulatory issues, stimulating domestic digital economy and export promotion through e-commerce.
The draft had talked about a framework for restrictions on cross-border data flow; collection or processing of sensitive data locally and storing it abroad; measures to contain sale of counterfeit products, prohibited items and pirated content; and review of the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions in the light of the changing digital economy.
The e-commerce policy aims to prepare strategies for providing a conducive environment for inclusive and harmonious growth of the e-commerce sector through a streamlined regulatory framework for ease of doing business, adoption of modern technologies, integration of supply chains and enhancing exports through this medium.
The government is also in the process of framing consumer protection rules for the sector.

Reliance Retail set to take its ethnic handicrafts brand Swadesh abroad,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-set-to-take-its-ethnic-handicrafts-brand-swadesh-abroad/articleshow/104324460.cms,11-10-2023,"New Delhi:
Reliance Retail
plans to open a dozen luxury stores for ethnic handicrafts under its
Swadesh
brand in India and overseas, executives directly aware of the developments said. The stores will be similar to government-run Central Cottage Industries Emporium stores but with a more upscale focus, the executives said.
The retail arm of
Reliance Industries
is in talks with local and global high-end designers and artisans to form strategic partnerships for ethnic handicrafts, fusion clothing, jewellery, blue pottery, silverware, home decor, and carpets among others, the executives said requesting anonymity. In addition,
Reliance
will link Swadesh with JioMart, its e-commerce marketplace, for the venture. JioMart, which has tie-ups with seven state government emporiums to sell on its platform, plans to onboard more than one million artisans and weavers by 2025 for Swadesh, the executives said. The company is also looking to develop
JioMart
Haat villages for the new venture.
""Reliance is following the same strategy for Swadesh, as it did for ready-to-wear pret and couture fashion - of inking strategic tie-ups with premium designers. In the case of Swadesh, the tie-ups will include artisans and handicraft makers,"" said one of the executives cited above.
In the Western lifestyle and fashion space, Reliance Retail currently has tie-ups with close to a dozen global luxury designer brands including
Versace
, Balenciaga, Armani,
Jimmy Choo
, Gas and
Hugo Boss
. The Swadesh stores will be large format, roughly 30,000-35,000 square feet each, in Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai, and will be company-owned, the executive said.

Reliance Retail piloted its first ethnic handicraft Swadesh store in Mumbai earlier this year at the Nita Mukesh Ambani Culture Centre. The handicraft venture is currently working with around 10,000 artisans, the executive said.
An email seeking comments from a spokesperson for Reliance Retail remained unanswered till press time.
Nita Ambani
, founder and chairperson of Reliance Foundation, said in an address at the company's recent AGM that
Reliance Foundation
skilling centres for artisans, a new venture under the group, will create ""capacity building to transform the crafts sector by creating livelihoods of Indian artisans across the country"".
While the handicraft sector remains largely fragmented and unorganised, it is a rapidly growing industry, and growth is being fuelled by micro-entrepreneurs, handicraft start-ups, direct-to-consumer (D2C) players, and state and centre-level craft bodies. Researcher IMARC Group forecasted the sector to reach $6.21 billion by 2028, from $3.96 billion in 2022.

India
such as
Amazon
and
Flipkart
to leverage their growing user base and sales-driving capabilities, said Samantha
Bukowski
, global head of ecommerce, GroupM
Nexus
.
The government’s Open Network for
Digital Commerce
(ONDC) will also give a fillip to ad spending on ecommerce platforms, which is forecast to have crossed $1 billion, she said. “I think that’s a fair estimate,” Bukowski said. “Growth in the ecommerce user base and adoption of ONDC will drive ad spending on ecommerce platforms in India.”
As per industry estimates, ad spending on ecommerce platforms in India is expanding at a healthy double-digit rate.
Globally, GroupM has forecast that retail media will grow 10% to reach $126 billion this year.
The media agency defines retail media as including ad revenue from last-mile delivery services. “It's matured quite a bit, but I think the growth is still strong considering how high the base has gotten,” she added.

Bukowski also said that brand advertising on ecommerce platforms should not just be viewed as a cost but also as an investment considering the value that they deliver. Advertising is generally considered a cost item by most companies.
“I think the ad spends on ecommerce is a bit of both (cost and investment). There’s the reality that it is a cost, but I think it all boils down to the measurement. Everything about commerce is that it should be highly accountable,” she added. Bukowski, however, emphasised that ecommerce platforms need to share more data and insights with clients and agencies, which will unlock more value for these platforms.
“Insights, accountability, and measurement are a huge part of what we expect the ecommerce platforms to deliver. That's where the value of those platforms sits for advertisers. And that’s what’s going to unlock the investment,” she said.
According to Bukowski, one of the major challenges in ecommerce is the fragmentation and ever-changing nature of consumer trends.
GroupM had earlier this year unified its e-commerce capability under GroupM Nexus Commerce and appointed Bukowski as its head. The e-commerce practice at GroupM has over 200 people in India and over 13,000 globally.

At present, around 11.9% in RRVL is owned by global investors, over 87% by RIL, and the rest by small investors. ET has also reported that
RIL
is going to sell more stake in RRVL to fund expansion, retire debt, and prepare for the unit's initial public offering (IPO). The stake sale is crucial because at the current valuation, RRVL's IPO size will be too large for the current liquidity to absorb. RRVL, through its units and associates, runs India's largest, fastest growing, and most profitable retail business, serving 267 million customers with an integrated omnichannel network of over 18,500 stores and digital commerce platforms across grocery, electronics, fashion and lifestyle, and pharma consumption baskets.
Isha Ambani, executive director of RRVL, said in the release that ADIA's long-standing experience of over decades of value creation globally will benefit the firm in implementing its vision and driving transformation of the Indian retail sector.
'In Alignment with Strategy'
""ADIA's investment in RRVL is a further testament to their belief in the Indian economy and our business fundamentals, strategy and execution capabilities,"" Isha Ambani said.
Hamad Shahwan Aldhaheri
, executive director of the private equities department at ADIA, said Reliance Retail has demonstrated strong growth and adaptability in a market that is evolving at an unprecedented pace.
""This investment aligns with our strategy of supporting our portfolio companies that are transforming their respective end-markets. We are pleased to partner with Reliance Group and increase our exposure to India's dynamic and fast-growing consumer sector,"" he said.
Morgan Stanley
acted as financial advisor to RRVL while Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and Davis Polk & Wardwell acted as legal counsels.

Hamad Shahwan Aldhaheri, Executive Director of the Private Equities Department, ADIA, said: ""Reliance Retail has demonstrated strong growth and adaptability in a market that is evolving at an unprecedented pace. This investment aligns with our strategy of supporting our portfolio companies that are transforming their respective end markets. We are pleased to partner with the Reliance Group, and increase our exposure to India's dynamic and fast-growing consumer sector"".
In 2020, RRVL had raised Rs 47,265 crore (around USD 6.4 billion) from global private equity funds for a 10.09 per cent stake, valuing the company at more than Rs 4.2 lakh crore.
This was the largest fundraising exercise in the sector at that time.
The company had raised funds from Silver Lake, KKR, Mubadala, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, GIC, TPG, General Atlantic and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund at a valuation of around USD 57 billion at that time.
RRVL is aggressively expanding its business here by acquiring the companies and getting the franchise rights of leading international brands for India.
Besides, it is investing in scaling up infrastructure and also acquired the India business of German retail major Metro Cash and Carry.
In August, during the AGM of Reliance Industries, its Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said several marquee global strategic and financial investors have shown strong interest in Reliance Retail.
Addressing shareholders, he had said if RRVL was listed on stock exchanges, then based on the current valuation, it would be among the top four listed entities in the country.
In less than three years, the valuation of Reliance Retail has doubled, and the pace of this value creation is ""unmatched globally"", Ambani had said.
In its latest annual report, RIL said Reliance Retail had achieved a significant milestone of crossing a billion transactions, and its registered user base has grown to 249 million.
In FY23, Reliance Retail's digital commerce and new commerce businesses contributed to 18 per cent of its revenue, which stood at Rs 2.60 lakh crore.

Etailers bet big on Apple iPhones; steep discounts and deals expected to drive festive season sales surge,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/etailers-bet-big-on-apple-iphones-steep-discounts-and-deals-expected-to-drive-festive-season-sales-surge/articleshow/104190868.cms,05-10-2023,"There is something about the
Apple iPhone
in
Indian e-commerce
. While initially the iPhone was a way to make the big occasion sales popular, even almost a decade later marketplaces like
Amazon
and
Flipkart
are still heavily dependent on the iPhone as their ""hero"" product for the upcoming
festive season sales
which begins this weekend.
Trackers and industry executives said there will be maximum discounts on iPhone 12-14 series by online sellers and such offers will be heavily promoted by the marketplaces, whereby the e-commerce contribution to iPhone sales will surge from around 40% to 50-55% during the festive season. Such high sales of iPhones boost the sales value of the marketplaces, increase traffic manifolds, help them to increase their average ticket sizes and build their brand.
In 2020 and 2021, online discounts on iPhones had either vanished or drastically come down as Apple, like every other electronic manufacturer, was grappling with Covid-led supply chain disruptions amid high demand. Discounts on iPhones returned in 2022, but this time around they will be steeper as the marketplaces and their sellers want to grow their business in double digit.
“Online discounting on older iPhone models will be steeper than last year,” said Tarun Pathak, research director at market tracker Counterpoint Research. “Apple has a wide iPhone portfolio and the older models can be discounted steeply during the sale. This will help the marketplaces to increase consumer stickiness and drive some high ticket transactions since Indian consumers don’t tend to buy online when transaction value is more than Rs 50,000-60,000,” he said.
Apple’s iPhone 12 is going to be priced at Rs 38,999 as compared to current price of Rs 48,999 in Flipkart and the marketplace is already promoting lowest ever price on last year’s iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models. Amazon too is likely to offer low prices on iPhone 13 and 14 series, industry executives said.

Rs 1 lakh bill doesn't worry Indians when buying premium phones
The Android competition too is waiting to wage a price war. Samsung on Thursday announced price drops by up to Rs 25,000 on premium models like Galaxy S22 and S21 FE. The company is offering as much as 45% discount on older foldable models. OnePlus is gearing up to launch its first foldable smartphone.
Emails sent to Amazon, Flipkart and Apple remained unanswered till Thursday press time.
Navkendar Singh, associate vice president of market researcher IDC India, said deals on iPhones helps marketplaces to attract eyeballs and ride the premiumisation wave. “Apart from low prices, there will be steep exchange offers and EMIs. Such deals become an easy entry point for a lot of new iPhone consumers which is still an aspirational product in India,” he said.
Also, there is limited backlash from offline retail lobbies on online iPhone discounting since Apple does not sell through every shop unlike Samsung, Xiaomi or Oppo.

Further Apple and its distributors have maintained that it will comply with Indian laws and rules such as Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act and Consumer Protection Act which do not allow companies to directly control selling prices beyond stating its maximum retail price.
In a survey conducted by Counterpoint Research in October, 42% respondents said they plan to purchase a premium smartphone (Rs 30,000 and above), with most users preferring online channels over retail stores. IDC India expects at least a 30-40% growth in iPhone shipments by the end of the year driven by strong sales during the festive season. Apple has already shipped over 4 million units in India in the first half of the year, and is expected to easily beat last year’s record 6 million shipments.

Indian companies ready to sacrifice profit margins in hunt for festive sales push,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/companies-may-sacrifice-profit-margins-amid-festive-sales-push/articleshow/104168521.cms,05-10-2023,"Margins of consumer goods, white goods and
fashion retailers
are expected to remain under strain as they put sales growth ahead of profit during this
festive season
. Most companies have started seeing green shoots in demand and hiking prices may derail the recovery.
For instance, electronics companies said despite elevated prices in raw materials, they will not hike prices and instead offer promotions to mop up higher demand. Input costs have gone up in components such as plastic due to increase in crude oil prices, television panels, and the appreciating dollar has worsened the impact, too. As a result, the 2-3% reduction in input cost in July-August from April-June has been neutralised again.
""Companies have decided to hold onto prices till the festive season despite cost pressures to boost sales. This will have a couple of percentage point impact on margins in the October-December quarter,"" said
Godrej Appliances
business head Kamal Nandi.
The cost pressure had come down from this year forcing most brands to either cut prices like in smartphones or offer promotional offers without hurting margins. This seems to have reversed. Input costs for the electronic industry had shot up 20-30% in the three years of pandemic, both due to increase in commodity prices such as steel, copper, aluminium and due to components like semiconductors.

Companies had passed on 15-25% of this as price hikes in phases, but still absorbed a bit to try and push demand.
""Television panel prices have gone up 30-35% since January, but no company is increasing prices due to the festive season. In fact, companies will undertake deep discounting to clear out unsold inventory whereby margins will bleed,"" said Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive of Super Plastronics, which has the licence to sell

The transaction, which has been approved by the Superdry board, will also require the approval of the company’s shareholders and lenders.
Following the completion of the transaction, Superdry expects to receive around £28.3 million net of transaction costs and taxation. The funds will be used to bolster the company’s balance sheet, boost liquidity, and fund its ongoing working capital requirements as part of a turnaround plan.
Superdry entered India in 2012 in partnership with Reliance Brands. Reliance Brands is a venture of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) and it partners with independent fashion brands in segments like luxury, bridge-to-luxury and high-premium and high-street lifestyle such as Armani Exchange, Burberry, Bally, Canali, Diesel, Gas, Hugo Boss, Hamleys and Jimmy Choo, Valentino and Balenciaga for the Indian market.
Reliance Brands also acquired toy retailer Hamleys in 2019.
Reliance Brands is the premium retail arm of RRVL. RRVL operates more than 18,000 stores across India spanning more than 50 luxury fashion brands with a presence in 7,000 towns and a total shopping area of more than 65 million square feet.

"Indians to splurge more this festive season, and that too in cash",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indians-to-splurge-more-this-festive-season-and-that-too-in-cash/articleshow/104154665.cms,04-10-2023,"With pockets full and intentions set,
Indians
are ready to spend extravagantly this
festive season
, highlighted a
UBS
report on Wednesday.
Interestingly, the finding suggests that the inclination towards digital payments has witnessed a drop to 58 per cent from 71 per cent earlier. Meanwhile, the intent to make
cash
payments accelerated to 35 per cent from 27 per cent earlier. This, in turn, hints at people willing to spend more on local and offline products giving a boost to Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
's Vocal for Local scheme.
According to the report, 70 per cent of the respondents expect festive spend to rise while another 18 per cent of respondents expect stable spending against last year. However, 11 per cent of respondents expect a slowdown in their festive spending.

What's on buying list?
Indians have always been attracted to buying
gold
as a preferred way of savings/investments and the affinity for the yellow metal may act as the driver of consumer spending this festive season.

According to the report, 50 per cent of the survey respondents bought gold, jewellery as planned or more than planned in the last three months. However, this can be linked with wedding season along with festivals.
ET Online
Buy as much gold/jewellery in the past 3 months as respondents has planned (Source: UBS report)
The property purchase intentions have also remained largely resilient with 52 per cent of 'unique' respondents planning to purchase property over the next two years which is a testimony of the desire to reside in self-owned properties. ""Notably, in the affordable housing segment (below Rs 5mn), sensitivity to interest rates is higher with 62 per cent of respondents planning to buy a house under Rs 2.5mn and 58 per cent planning to buy a house between Rs 2.5mm-4.9mn stating they are likely to defer the purchase if mortgage rates rise to 9 per cent or more,"" the report flagged.
In addition, smartphones, two wheelers and cars have been highlighted as other areas of interest for consumers willing to spend. Under the consumer durable category, ACs, TVs, refrigerators and laptops remained top priorities for expenditure.
Inflation
concerns
The high inflation has been a key concern for people willing to spend. According to the survey, about 60 per cent of survey respondents reported price increase over 6 per cent in the last one to two years.
With current inflation print at 6.8 per cent, which is beyond the
Reserve Bank of India
's tolerance band of 2-6 per cent, the consumers are worried of losing the festive spirit.
Sharp spikes in food prices have been the main driver for inflation as erratic weather conditions hurt production of staples like vegetables, milk and cereals.

“Since partnering with RBL in 2012, the Superdry brand has expanded rapidly in India. Considering the backdrop of a growing Indian economy, a growing population of affluent shoppers, and ever-increasing apparel consumption rates, the Superdry brand in the market has attractive potential. As the leading fashion retail operator in India, RBUK is best placed, through a majority IP ownership stake, to maximise the opportunity,” Superdry said.

AAR ruling could offer advantages to e-commerce platforms facilitating logistic,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/aar-ruling-could-offer-advantages-to-e-commerce-platforms-facilitating-logistic/articleshow/104125165.cms,03-10-2023,"In a recent development, the
GST
Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) in Karnataka has ruled that Juspay Technologies, the company operating the ride-hailing app 'Namma Yatri,' qualifies as an e-commerce operator under GST regulations. However, the
AAR
has clarified that the Bengaluru-based firm is not obligated to collect and remit GST on transportation fares because the supply of passenger transportation does not occur ""through"" their platform, as reported by The Times of India (TOI).
According to Section 9(5) of the GST Act, e-commerce operators are mandated to collect and remit GST for specific ""notified"" services. The AAR's decision underscored that the services provided by auto drivers to their passengers are not categorized as a supply by
JustPay Technologies
.
It's crucial to bear in mind that AAR rulings do not establish legal precedents but can exert an influence on similar cases.
Harpreet Singh
, an
indirect tax
partner at
KPMG-India
, explained to TOI, ""According to this ruling, if an entity merely connects service providers and end customers without actively participating in the transaction or exerting control over the service provision, it would not be considered a supply of service 'through' the entity. Consequently, entities facilitating notified services would not be liable for GST collection and payment.""
This ruling may have implications for the GST liability of e-commerce operators offering services covered under section 9(5), such as passenger transportation, restaurants, housekeeping, and hotel accommodation.
Pratik Jain
, a partner at Pricewaterhouse, highlighted the ambiguity in the term ""supplies made through e-commerce operator,"" which lacks precise definition. He cautioned that the AAR's reliance on dictionary definitions and common usage could lead to interpretation variations by GST authorities, necessitating a case-specific analysis to determine the applicability of section 9(5).

According to a TOI report, Jain also referred to a previous ruling by the
Appellate Authority of Advance Ruling
(AAAR) in the case of OPTA cabs, emphasizing the significance of evaluating the specific business models to ascertain GST obligations. In the case of 'Namma Yatri,' the app functioned solely as a connector between auto drivers and passengers. Passenger transportation was conducted independently, with the app having no control over service provision details. There was no centralized call center or control room, and payments were directly collected by the auto drivers without being tracked through the app.

Future Retail lenders reject Space Mantra's bid; NCLT extends insolvency period for 15 days,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/future-retail-lenders-reject-space-mantras-bid-nclt-extends-insolvency-period-for-15-days/articleshow/104112625.cms,03-10-2023,"The lenders of
Future Retail
Ltd have rejected the bid submitted by
Space Mantra
for the debt-ridden firm, which is currently going through Corporate
Insolvency
Resolution Process (CIRP). The Resolution Plan submitted by Space Mantra for Future Retail Ltd (
FRL
), failed to get the required number of votes in the e-voting process of the Committee of creditors (CoC).
It was put ""for the consideration of the CoC on July 19, 2023... and pursuant to the decision taken by CoC through e-voting, concluded on 30th September 2023 at 9 PM (IST), the resolution plan submitted by Space Mantra Private Limited has not been approved by CoC"", FRL said in a
regulatory filing
on Monday.
It further added: ""In view of the resolution plan not having been approved by the CoC, the next steps would be taken in accordance with the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code 2016.""
Space Mantra was the single bidder for FRL. According to some media reports, Space Mantra had offered around Rs 550 crore, which was very close to liquidation value. It was just 2.8 per cent of FRL's outstanding dues of Rs 19,773 crore to its financial creditors.
Moreover, in another filing FRL said that the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) has extended the deadline to complete the CIRP for 15 days, accepting the company's request.

""Consequently, the last date for completion of CIRP of FRL is September 30, 2023,"" it said.
This is the fourth extension granted by the Mumbai bench of FRL. Earlier, the deadline to complete CIRP of FRL was September 15, which was the third extension granted by the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
The insolvency proceedings against FRL were started by the tribunal on July 20, 2022.
The Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) mandates the completion of CIRP within 330 days, which includes time taken during litigations.
Last week, Kishore Biyani, the erstwhile promoter of debt-ridden Future Retail, has moved the Bombay High Court against the forensic audit process of the company.

An Amitabh Bachchan advert has landed Flipkart in big trouble with mobile phone retailers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-up-in-arms-over-flipkart-ad-on-phone-offers/articleshow/104092448.cms,02-10-2023,"Smartphone retailers have called out an advertisement by
Flipkart
featuring
Amitabh Bachchan
which they allege misleads buyers into believing online platforms offer better deals this festive season. In a Hindi advertisement by the online retailer, aired to promote its upcoming festive sales, the film star could be heard saying that the kind of mobile deals Flipkart is offering will not be available at retail stores.
Reacting to the advertisement, the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA), which represents 150,000 mobile retailers, has written to leading smartphone brands to highlight the issue and also ask the brand heads to ""issue either a joint or individual statement in prominent news media outlets, publicly clarifying that these statements are not accurate.""
— AIMDAINDIA (@AIMDAINDIA)
""Our purpose in addressing you is to express our deep concern and disappointment regarding the recent wave of derogatory advertisements that have been proliferating across various online platforms, social media, and print media. These advertisements have been influencing the buying behaviour of customers through false and misleading statements, such as the one promoted by Flipkart with the endorsement of the mega star, Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, stating, 'yeh Dukan per nahin milne wala' (This will not be found in stores),"" AIMRA said in its letter to smartphone brands. ET has reviewed copies of the letter.
Flipkart, meanwhile, has made the ad private on YouTube. Emails to the company did not elicit a response till press time.

Separately, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a body representing 80 million retailers, has written to the Bollywood actor condemning his endorsement.
“We are highly disheartened to witness your recent advertisement for Flipkart, where you claimed that deals and offers are not available at shopkeepers, thereby misleading and influencing customers…,” CAIT said.
E-commerce platforms, in a bid to increase revenues, often undertake deep discounting of products, especially smartphones, undercutting retail competition to offer deals that are hard to ignore by consumers, say market experts.
Deep discounting, often seen as predatory pricing by small Indian retailers, have been a bone of contention in the fight between the online platforms and offline retailers. The government is reportedly in the process of drafting an e-commerce policy, which is expected to address the issue of deep discounting, among others.
Meanwhile, the retailer bodies are in talks with smartphone brands to ensure adequate stocks of popular models and parity in prices, ET reported earlier.
The development comes at a time of growing phone shipments to offline channels. Overall shipments to online channels fell 15% from a year earlier in Q2 2023, while offline channels grew by 11% to capture 54% market share, IDC India said.

Vijaykumar Iyer
sought a fresh opportunity to seek new bids for
Future Retail
, springing a surprise for the
lenders
that rejected
Space Mantra
's Rs 550-crore buyout offer Saturday evening, people aware of the development told ET. Instantly and unanimously, lenders rejected his proposal to restart the process, the people said.
Voting results declared by RP late Sunday evening showed that 58% of lenders voted against the plan, the people said.
Kishore Biyani-promoted Future Retail, which is undergoing a corporate insolvency process, received only one eligible resolution plan from Space Mantra even as large conglomerates such as
Adani Group
and
Reliance Industries
had made expressions of interest.
“After the voting lines closed at 9.00 pm Saturday, the resolution professional conducted a virtual meeting with lenders and insisted that the process to find a buyer should be restarted,” said one of the persons cited above. “Lenders rejected his proposal as they believe it would be a waste of time. There is no certainty that they would receive improved offers during the re-run of the process,” the same person said.

""Although the RP did not immediately release the voting results, it was clear from day one that most lenders are voting against the plan,"" said a senior bank official. If more than 66% of lenders (by value) vote against the plan, the RP must recommend liquidation to the National Company Law Tribunal.
Per the revised Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, which regulates the resolution process, the RP cannot continue as liquidator for the same company.
“The offer of Rs 550 crore is too low, and the entire sale process is riddled with irregularities,” said a senior bank official.
HDFC Bank
, a debtholder of Future Retail pointed out several irregularities by the RP and alleged that he failed in his duty to maximise the value for financial creditors, as reported by ET on September 2. In a letter to verified lenders on August 29, the private bank stated that to date, the RP has not provided lenders with store wise updates on inventories, nor has he made any attempt to gain access to the stores, despite a directive from the tribunal on April 20.
FRL operated 1,308 retail stores under the Big Bazaar, Easyday and Foodhall names per the FY21 annual report. However, only 302 stores were part of FRL when corporate insolvency was initiated.
Of this, the RP did not have access to 228 stores. He was able to vacate only 16 stores and took no effort to retain control of the remaining stores despite a directive from the tribunal to the local administration to support him, HDFC Bank said in the letter.
The RP has accepted claims worth Rs 28,114 crore, of which verified lenders account for Rs 14,422 crore.
In August 2020, FRL signed an agreement to sell its entire business to Reliance Industries-linked subsidiaries in a multi-stage transaction, but litigation by ecommerce giant Amazon.com claiming violation of a shareholder agreement delayed the deal.
In March 2022,
Reliance Industries
took possession of the premises housing about 900 Future Retail stores due to non-payment of rentals. Reliance separated the inventory and furniture from the stores. In April, lenders voted against the deal, following which Reliance formally called off the Rs 24,713 crore transaction and FRL was admitted to corporate insolvency.

Festive Season: Dispute between online and offline retailers back,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-sound-out-brands-over-discounts/articleshow/104052175.cms,30-09-2023,"The tussle between online and offline retailers has staged a comeback after three years this festive season, with leading electronics and mobile phone brick-and-mortar retailers urging brands to maintain parity in prices,
consumer offers
and stock supplies to help them compete with e-commerce platforms.

groups representing these retailers have written letters in this regard to Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Realme, Xiaomi and OnePlus. They said they are in the process of writing to other big firms such as LG,
Bosch
, Godrej,
Whirlpool
and Sony.
The retailers fear that the brands may offer deep discounts on their online-exclusive and end-of-life models whose supplies will be focused on e-commerce platforms, considering almost all the firms are saddled with excess unsold inventory which they want to clear in the upcoming festive sales. These retailers together operate more than 1,55,000 outlets and have a collective turnover of more than Rs 42,000 crore.
The industry groups which have reached out to the brands include the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA), which represents interests of about 1,50,000 neighbourhood stores; South Indian Organised Retailers Association (ORA), which has under its umbrella more than 20 retail chains such as Poorvika, Big C and Sangeetha; and the Association of Consumer Electronics and Home Appliances Traders (CEHAT), which represents 43 retail chains, including Viveks, Great Eastern Retail, Adishwar, Girias and Pai Electronics.

""We hope that the same prices, offers, and sufficient stock of all models in the mainline (or offline channel) will continue to be available across platforms,"" said the AIMRA letter written by its chairman Kailash Lakhyani to Realme.
CEHAT president Raj Kumar Pai said the association will write a letter to electronics and home appliances firms next week since the industry desperately needs a level playing field for survival. ""Predatory pricing will kill
offline retail
. Retailers need decent profit to run the show. If brands offer discounts on online exclusive models, the offline too needs a similar model with similar pricing,"" he said.
The ORA letter to Samsung India CEO JB Park said the company's prices and offers must align with online initiatives during the festive season.
Flipkart and Amazon are starting their biggest discounting sale from October 8 and have already started pre-festive discounts, a rare move which industry executives said is aimed at clearing inventory.
Other online platforms such as Reliance Retail-owned JioMart and Tata-owned
Tata Neu
are also set to join the discounting bandwagon, the executives said.
E-commerce platforms have maintained that any discounting is done either by their sellers or brands, while almost all the brands have said they maintain parity in pricing and offers between channels.
Deep discounts on electronics and mobile phones - the largest selling categories during online festive sales, with more than 50% share of the total sales - had reduced significantly from 2020 till last year due to high demand and low supplies. However, demand has nosedived since last Diwali and all manufacturers are under pressure to liquidate stock. The festive season is the largest sales period for electronic products, accounting for around 30% of their annual sales.

ADIA looks to put $600 million into RIL's retail business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/adia-looks-to-put-600-million-into-rils-retail-business/articleshow/103973852.cms,27-09-2023,"After Qatar, yet another oil-rich Gulf sovereign fund, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), is looking to buy an additional stake in
Mukesh Ambani
’s sprawling retail empire.
ADIA
is seeking to invest $600 million into the organized retailing business of Asia's richest person, people aware of the developments told ET, at valuations that significantly exceed those during an earlier concluded round three years ago.
ADIA is already an investor in
Reliance Retail Ventures
(RRVL), having bought a 1.2% stake for Rs 5,512.50 crore ($751 million) in October 2020, when the company raised Rs Rs 47,265 crore by selling 10.09% stake to a clutch of bulge-bracket investors that included Saudi PIF, Mubadala,
GIC
of Singapore, Silverlake, TPG and GA.
From the previous bunch of investors, KKR has already made a follow-on investment of Rs 2,069.50 crore at a pre-money equity value of Rs 8.361 lakh crore ($100 billion), making RRVL among the top four companies by implied market capitalization in the country.
Thus far, Qatar's $1-billion infusion has been the only fresh investment in the current round of fund raise.
The current valuation is almost at a 60% premium to the last financing round three years ago, but is much lower than what most equity analysts perceive the value of the privately held retail business to be. Analysts in AllianceBernstein in May had recommended a $131-billion valuation for Reliance Retail.

Premium valuations
“This further cements the strategic relations between the two companies on the back of a strong government relationship between the two sovereigns,” said an official on the condition of anonymity as the talks are in private domain. “ADIA is a major investor in Indian equities, infrastructure and financial services, but it is not often that it doubles down - especially at such premium valuations.”
Interestingly, Reliance Industries itself valued RRVL at $148 billion when it decided early July to buy out minority shareholders and employee stock option holders that collectively owned 0.09% at a 60% premium to the $93 billion and $97 billion valuations determined, respectively, by two independent valuers - Ernst & Young Merchant Banking Services and BDO Valuation Advisory.
RRVL owns a 99.91% stake in
Reliance Retail
Limited. It intends to get back the remaining shares at Rs 1,362 per unit, a 60% premium to the valuation given by EY and BDO. This premium would value
Reliance Retail Limited
at as high as $148 billion.
A formal announcement is due in the coming days.
ADIA and Reliance Retail declined to comment.
Dwarfs target,
Midea
At a $100-billion valuation, Reliance Retail is the 12th largest retail giant on the planet - ahead of JD.com, Target, Midea and Lululemon. Amazon, LVMH,
Walmart
, Home Depot and Alibaba are the top five in terms of market value, as per Bloomberg data.
Even though Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Industries, did not publicly give any figures, he had told shareholders during the recent annual general meeting that “several marque investors have shown interest in Reliance Retail.” Recent media reports suggest Reliance is looking to raise anywhere between $1.5 and $4 billion in a fund raise that many see as a valuation benchmark-setting exercise before an eventual listing.
Ambani had said during the company's 2019 annual general meeting that the retail business would be listed within the next five years. ET in its August 25 edition reported the company planned to dilute another 8-10%.
Reliance Retail posted an annual revenue of Rs 2,60,364 crore in FY23, registering a year-on-year growth of 30% and an EBITDA of Rs 17,928 crore and a net profit of Rs 9,181 crore. Half the revenues come from grocery. However, the gross debt of the business has also gone up significantly as the retail arm is fast expanding into newer categories and formats, while the company is also making a foray into the FMCG business.
Gross debt for Reliance Retail standalone business as of FY23 end was reported at Rs 70,937.72 crore, up from Rs 40,756.44 crore at FY22 end. Net debt to EBITDA was 4X. The management expects Reliance Retail to be its fastest growing business in revenue and EBITDA.
Jio Mart, Reliance Digital
Reliance Retail houses Reliance Industries’ core retail businesses, including Reliance Digital, Jio Mart and more than 18,00 brick-and-mortar stores. The current 65 million square feet store footprint is expected to reach 100 million sq ft in the next 3-5 years. It also has a warehouse capacity of 50 million square foot. Two thirds of these stores are in Tier II, Tier III cities and smaller towns.
Reliance Retail is fully owned by RRVL, which also has other retail operations such as international partnerships and fast-moving consumer goods business. Reliance Industries, in turn, owns 85% of RRVL.
“We expect continued market share gains for Retail, which we expect to grow from circa 11% in 3QFY23 to 24% by FY26E,” Nikhil Bhandari of Goldman Sachs said in a recent report.
Reliance also launched its FMCG foray playing on the price factor acquiring and partnering with several legacy and regional brands --- Campa Cola, Sosyo, and Lotus. Partnerships include those with General Mills and Maliban. The plan is to scale it up further in India as well as tap global markets starting with Asia and Africa.
CLSA calculations showed the capex in Reliance's retail business rose to $6 billion in FY23 and investments from funds like QIA will help fund future capex and keep debt in retail under control. Several Reliance group watchers argue that the company is still in its “investment phase” and would likely continue to have high capex and return on equity/return on invested capital.
The company has, therefore, moved a third of the total capex (related to warehousing) into an InVIT but investments in store fronts and technology would continue.

Kishore Biyani moves Bombay High Court against BDO and Bank of India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/kishore-biyani-moves-bombay-high-court-against-bdo-and-bank-of-india/articleshow/103941800.cms,26-09-2023,"Kishore Biyani
, founder of the
Future Group
has challenged the forensic audit process and the report submitted by accounting firm
BDO India
LLP and its lender
Bank of India
at the Bombay High Court.
On Monday,
Future Retail
said in the stock exchange announcement that Biyani has filed a writ petition against the company, its forensic auditor BDO India and its lender Bank of India.
Biyani approached the court through the law firm Naik Naik & Co on September 15 and the division bench of Justice Sunil B. Shukre and Justice Firdosh Phiroze Pooniwalla will hear the matter on October 31.
The development comes after Future Retail’s lender Bank of India last month asked the distressed company as well as its promoters Kishore Biyani and Rakesh Biyani to submit their response on a forensic audit report.
The lender had appointed BDO India as the forensic auditor to conduct the forensic audit of Future Retail’s account. The company had availed various credit facilities that became the Non-Performing Asset (NPA) on 31 January 2022.

Last year in July, the Mumbai bench of the
National Company Law Tribunal
(
NCLT
) admitted
Future Retail Ltd
(FRL) under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in an application filed by its lender Bank of India.
The state-owned lender Bank of India had filed an application to admit the company following the Rs 3,495 crore default on the one-time restructuring scheme between the bank and the company. Currently, the company has admitted claims of over Rs 19,185 crore.
When the company was admitted under the CIRP, its assets included 620 stores, among them 30 Big Bazaar hypermarkets and 350 smaller-format outlets.

Supreme Court rejects Future Group companies' pleas seeking stay on DRT order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/supreme-court-rejects-future-group-companies-pleas-seeking-stay-on-drt-order/articleshow/103941592.cms,26-09-2023,"The
Supreme Court
on Monday dismissed two
Future Group
companies' appeals against a debt recovery tribunal (
DRT
) order on July 31 that restrained them from alienating their assets worth ₹4,478.22 crore in recovery proceedings initiated by lenders. The top court refused to interfere with the Delhi HC's interim order last month.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
The HC had, while issuing notice to the government and various lenders including
RBL Bank
and
Yes Bank
, refused to stay the DRT order and posted the matter for hearing on October 18.
Future Corporate Resources and Future Brands told a bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud that the HC had observed the existence of a prima facie case in their favour, but erred in failing to note that irreparable injury will be caused by depriving them of the right to use their property without due process of law.
Senior counsel AM Singhvi and Ritin Rai, appearing for Future Group firms, said the companies have been restrained from dealing with not only the assets secured against credit facilities availed from one of the lenders only, but also all other assets as well.
Furthermore, the HC had failed to note that the tribunal had restrained them from dealing with assets worth ₹4,478.22 crore against a total debt of ₹132.41 crore, the appeal stated. Challenging the validity of various provisions of the Recovery of Debt and Bankruptcy Act 1993 that allegedly ""confer drastic and extraordinary powers"" upon the tribunal, the two Future companies said the provisions do not provide an opportunity of being heard before adverse orders are passed mechanically and without application of mind by the tribunal in respect of the assets and properties of debt-laden firms.

Such ""wide-sweeping orders"" of the tribunal have the effect of incapacitating the borrower from discharging the debt by liquidating its unsecured assets, thereby obstructing the recovery of debt and, thus act contrary to the very purpose of the Act, the firms stated.

As per the survey, ""81 per cent of consumers intend to shop online during this festive season. 1 in 2 consumers are willing to increase their spending this festive period compared to last year.""

No proposal for independent regulator in proposed e-commerce policy: Official,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/no-proposal-for-independent-regulator-in-proposed-e-commerce-policy-official/articleshow/103932674.cms,25-09-2023,"The proposed

, which is under formulation, has no provision for setting up of an independent regulator for online retail platforms, a senior official said. The official also said regarding data related issues, the e-commerce firms have to comply with the
Digital Personal Data Protection
(
DPDP
) Act and the proposed policy will not cover that area.
The proposed national e-commerce policy is in the final stages and no new draft will be issued now for seeking views of stakeholders as that exercise has been completed by the ministry.
""The ministry has to give a presentation of the proposed policy to the prime minister's office. There is no plan to set up any regulator for the sector, at least not in the near future. As of now, it is not on the anvil,"" the official, who did not wish to be named, said.
The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) on August 2 held a detailed discussion with representatives of e-commerce firms and a domestic traders' body on the proposed policy.
In that meeting, a broad level of consensus emerged among the concerned stakeholders on the proposed policy.

Earlier the ministry had issued two draft national e-commerce policies.
The 2019 draft proposed to address six broad areas of the e-commerce ecosystem -- infrastructure development, e-commerce marketplaces, regulatory issues, stimulating domestic digital economy and export promotion through e-commerce.
The draft had talked about measures to contain sale of counterfeit products, prohibited items and pirated content; and review of the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions in the light of the changing digital economy.
Besides, it had suggested provisions on promoting exports through e-commerce.
The proposed policy would take into account the interests of all stakeholders, like investors, manufacturers, MSMEs, traders, retailers, startups and consumers, another official said.
The government is also in the process of framing consumer protection rules for the sector.
Broadly the intention is to make the policy work along with the consumer protection rules and not in conflict with each other.
Domestic traders' body CAIT has time and again demanded roll out of the policy as they had alleged that foreign online retailers violate norms of the
FDI
(
Foreign Direct Investment
) in commerce and the government should take action against those who are indulging in malpractices.
The DPIIT is also working on a national retail trade policy.
Domestic traders have suggested for a regulatory authority be set up to monitor and regulate e-commerce trade in the country.

GoKwik launches solutions for peak sale period traffic for D2C brands,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/gokwik-launches-solutions-for-peak-sale-period-traffic-for-d2c-brands/articleshow/103926245.cms,25-09-2023,"GoKwik
, an
e-commerce enabler
, said it has created deeper solutions to manage high order volumes during peak sale periods for
direct-to-consumer
brands during the
festive season
.
The company has developed a mechanism designed to ensure seamless order processing, even when brands experienced high demand. In addition, it enhanced checkout efficiency by streamlining the entire process of creating orders and making payments for customers by using fewer API requests.
""There’s a common issue called “429 errors” that is prevalent during festive sales or flash sales events. This usually occurs when an eCommerce brand receives more requests than the API rate limit set by the platform on which it’s built. This usually happens when there is a sudden surge of traffic on the website. As a result, some customers may encounter delays or experience issues while browsing or placing orders on the website,"" said Chirag Taneja, co-founder and CEO, GoKwik.
For instance, learning from a previously run flash sale in April of 2023, beauty and personal care brand
Pilgrim
anticipated a surge in online traffic and sales during its birthday sale event. GoKwik helped Pilgrim tackle the issue and effectively manage high order volumes in their recent 5-day flash sales last month.
GoKwik advised Pilgrim to increase the API rate limit to accommodate the expected surge in traffic. APR rate limit is the number of API requests a platform can handle per second. The company enabled a fivefold increase in the maximum number of requests the system could receive, going from 20 requests per second to 100 requests per second, ensuring that the website processed a higher volume of customer requests while maintaining stability.
Live Events
The festive season in India starts with Onam and covers Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali and Bhai Dooj. According to Axis My India consumer sentiment index, about 22% consumers plan to increase their expenses on clothing. Overall household spending has increased for 58% of the families, a 2% rise from the last two months and the highest increase in the last five months, the report said.
GoKwik said it is playing a critical role in managing downtime errors which can result in customer escalations and revenue loss for the brand. The company is working closely with many brands in its network to build such capabilities on KwikCheckout to help them maximize their revenue potential from the festive sales events.

India growing more than other markets for Lladro: global chief,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-growing-more-than-other-markets-for-lladro-global-chief/articleshow/103914111.cms,25-09-2023,"Spanish luxury porcelain brand Lladro, which has opened its second biggest store in the world in Delhi, plans to ramp up investment in India as it believes in the ""future evolution"" of the market, said its global chief executive officer,

India accounts for 11% of
Lladro
's global sales. The company generates 69% of its business from heritage concept (
high porcelain
,
classic sculptures
,
home
and licences), 21% from new concept (
design sculptures

Lladro will also have an ""important"" investment plan for developing online sales in the country next year, besides launching more mono-brand stores in the country, according to Rodriguez.
With the new boutique, Lladro now has eight own-brand stores in India in markets such as New Delhi, Gurugram, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata.
""For us, India is not only a key market but a very strategic market,"" Rodriguez told ET. ""Because we have seen growth in this market since the beginning. We have been here since 2000 and people love our products. And we still have room to grow. India was 8% of our global sales five years ago and now it contributes 11% to our global sales. It's growing much more than any other market.""
According to Rodriguez, Japan is the company's biggest market, accounting for a quarter of its sales.

""In terms of future growth, we are looking at the US, China and India. In India, our strategy is to have our mono-brand stores and control the stores directly because the brand and the products are so well understood that we want to preserve the way people see the brand,"" she said. ""We will continue opening more stores in the country, probably more stores in Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai."" During the Covid-19 pandemic, Lladro saw a surge in demand for Indian deity sculptures. From January to August last year, Lladro's business in India grew by 47% compared with the same period in 2021, making it the brand's most successful year in India. The price of the limited edition high-porcelain sculpture of Lord Balaji of 299 units, launched in 2018, grew by 38% since the launch and is now priced at ₹29,70,000 with only five units left in the world.
The company has launched a limited edition high-porcelain sculpture of Radha Krishna on a Swing of 299 units this year, priced at ₹7,50,000, and the Ram Darbar, priced at ₹2,36,000, in the classic collection category.
""The spirit of India collection and the Indian deity sculptures are a very important segment for us. Not just within India, but also outside India, there are so many Hindu communities in markets such as the US for example,"" said Rodriguez. ""Our Ganesha sculptures are always very successful.""
Rodriguez said one of the characteristics of Lladro is being colourful and there is a strong connection with Indian culture in that sense. ""We always approach our markets trying to understand the local mindset and culture in order to adapt and deliver something that connects with the people. And our 'Spirit of India' collection is a perfect match for India,"" she said.
The company is also focusing on segments such as lighting and jewellery and plans to ramp up the contribution of online sales to 25% over the next five years from 15% now.
Over the last two years, Lladro has opened stores in markets, including China, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal and Thailand. The expansion is aligned with the company's omni-channel strategy, focusing on strengthening both digital sales channels and physical points of sale.

Apparel retailers likely to register 7-8 per cent revenue growth this fiscal: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/apparel-retailers-likely-to-register-7-8-per-cent-revenue-growth-this-fiscal-report/articleshow/103818337.cms,20-09-2023,"Organised sector brick and mortar
apparel retailers
are expected to register a 7-8 per cent
revenue growth
this fiscal, buoyed by festival and marriage season demand, and despite inflation impacting
discretionary spending
in the first quarter, according to a report. Continued store expansion, including into tier-II and III cities, will also help revenue growth this fiscal and over the medium term,
Crisil
Ratings said in a report on Wednesday.
Despite moderation in topline growth, revenue growth will be comparable to the 8 per cent range seen before the pandemic, the report said.
Last fiscal, retailers had seen a strong 38 per cent growth on a low base, driven by swift recovery from the pandemic-induced slump and higher realisations following a steep jump in raw material prices.
Operating margins are seen at 8 per cent this fiscal as improving product mix in favour of the premium segment and lower input costs will offset the impact of higher marketing spends, the report said.
The pace of store area addition will be at the pre-pandemic level of 2.2 million sq ft in FY24, the report said, adding that it was 3.7 million sq ft in the last fiscal.

The
Crisil report
is based on an analysis of 39 organised apparel retailers, which accounted for a fourth of the Rs 1.9 lakh crore revenue last fiscal.
According to Anuj Sethi, a senior director at the agency, demand in the premium segment is rising gradually with consumers increasingly preferring branded garments, driven by return to office and buoyant corporate activity.
This is helping offset muted-to-low demand from the economy and value segments, which account for 60 per cent of the revenue, because of changes in discretionary spends, he said.
With continuous store expansion, and the onset of the festive and wedding seasons, demand should improve in the third quarter, which normally fetches around 35 per cent of the annual revenue.
Operating margin is seen at previous year's level of 8 per cent, despite significant reduction in prices of cotton, the key raw material, as per the report.
While store expansion in metros and tier-I cities will continue, retailers are also expanding to small towns, which will be relatively smaller-sized outlets.
Hence, the pace of area addition will normalise to pre-pandemic levels this fiscal. That, coupled with continuing investments to augment technology platforms and omni-channel infrastructure, will keep annual capex flat at last fiscal's Rs 2,000 crore.

“Demand from the premium segment is rising gradually with consumers increasingly preferring branded garments, driven by return to office and buoyant corporate activity. This is helping offset muted-to-low demand from the economy and value segments (60% of total revenues) because of changes in discretionary purchasing decisions, including due to rise in food inflation, in the recent past,” said Anuj Sethi, Senior Director CRISIL Ratings. “With continuous store expansion, and the onset of the festive and wedding season, demand should improve materially in the third quarter (35% of annual revenues) and a part of the fourth quarter, supporting revenue growth”.
Last fiscal, despite strong growth, revenue density (calculated as revenue per square feet) was below the pre- pandemic level due to substantial area added under new stores. The metric is expected to improve this fiscal with the pace of area addition normalising and demand from the premium category — the high-end apparels and ethnic wear segments — rising.
Yet, overall revenue density will remain below the pre-pandemic peak of ~Rs 11,700 per square feet.
Additionally, the share of online sales in overall revenue, which doubled to 8% last fiscal from pre-pandemic levels, is expected to stabilise as consumers mix online and physical shopping.
While store expansion in metros and Tier I cities will continue, retailers are also expanding to Tier II/III cities, which will be relatively smaller-sized outlets. Hence, the pace of area addition will normalise to pre-pandemic levels this fiscal. That, coupled with continuing investments to augment technology platforms and omni-channel infrastructure for online offerings, will keep annual capital spending at last fiscal’s level of Rs 2,000 crore.
Shounak Chakravarty, Associate Director, CRISIL Ratings said “While the capex will be partly debt funded, stable cash flows will ensure debt metrics remain adequate, lending stability to credit profiles. We expect interest coverage and total debt/Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) ratios.

India's e-commerce exports have a lot to complain about banking issues,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indias-e-commerce-exports-have-a-lot-to-complain-about-banking-issues/articleshow/103755369.cms,18-09-2023,"Expansion of India's e-commerce exports is being impeded by banking-related challenges, including a reluctance to process forex transactions through alternative channels and the imposition of high processing fees, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said. To unlock the full potential of the sector and achieve a target of $350 billion in e-commerce exports by 2030, there is a need for a shift in mindset and a resolution of these
banking issues
that hinder growth and inflate operational expenses, GTRI said.
""To initiate change, both the
RBI
and banks must shift their mindset towards treating small-value exports differently from larger ones. This shift is essential to prevent misuse while streamlining processes. Without this fundamental change, any reforms attempted by the RBI and banks will fall short,"" it said.
Small e-commerce companies frequently face difficulties due to the inefficiency of banks in managing low-value transactions, it added.
The key issues range from reluctance to process forex through alternate channels, high processing fees, incorrect purpose code allocation, and limitations in the RBI's EDPMS (Export Data Processing and Monitoring System).
The Reserve Bank of India tracks export payments and reconciliation through its Export Data Processing and Monitoring System.

""Banks are happy to process forex received through bank transfers but reluctant to process forex received through foreign currency cheques, payment gateways like PayPal, credit cards, Western Union, cash receipt when a buyer selects item live in the retail shop,"" it said.
Banks delay crediting forex received in a firm's account when payments are received through such channels, and this affects cash flow and hampers business operations, the report noted.
Banks charge money multiple times at different stages for the same small-value shipment, it added.
Elaborating this, it said that essential charges include charges for submitting shipping bills (Rs 80 to Rs 2,000) at the time of forex realisation (1-to-2.5 per cent of value), intermediary bank charges during forex transfers (USD 10 to USD 55 per transaction), penalties for bills pending at EDPMS (Rs 100 per shipping bill per month).
""Most charges are fixed for a transaction irrespective of value. Bank charges can exceed 50-60 per cent of the shipment value. This makes e-commerce exports commercially unviable,"" it said, adding banks allocate purpose codes for each remittance but frequently issue incorrect codes.
For example, purpose code P0103, meant for advance payments, is often assigned even when exports have already occurred and the firm has submitted proof. Incorrect allocation of purpose codes by banks leads to reconciliation problems, EDPMS pendency issues, and issuance of notices and fines on exporters.
The RBI issues notices to exporters for EDPMS defaults but does not give them direct access to view their records, as per the report.
""Exporters must rely on banks/DGFT for critical data, leading to unnecessary delays and complications,"" GTRI co-founder Ajay Srivastava said.
The report suggested eight action points, such as the creation of a single window platform for e-commerce and small-value shipments, standardise bank charges, defining a time limit for banks to complete all small export-related requests by the RBI, and exempting shipment value up to USD 1,000 per shipment from monitoring till the single window is implemented.
It also pitched for an extension of the timeline for EDPMS closure from the current nine months to 24 months and redesign the courier shipping bill to reflect correct payment terms.
On the single window, Srivastava called for integrating the RBI, banks, Customs, DGFT, India Post, courier companies and exporters.
""This platform should cover all realisation methods other than bank transfers. The exporter should be able to conduct all transactions online. SW will automate the EDPMS reconciliation process,"" he added.
He said that high processing fees and multiple charges at different stages of exporting hurt small businesses the most, and the banks should charge a one-time fee for each shipment instead of further charges at various stages.
""The government could subsidise these fees to ease the financial burden on small exporters,"" the report said, adding there is a need to raise the export realisation variation limit from 25 per cent to 100 per cent.

Denmark's retail furniture chain BoConcept to expand further in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/denmarks-retail-furniture-chain-boconcept-to-expand-further-in-india/articleshow/103753337.cms,18-09-2023,"Denmark's
retail furniture
chain
BoConcept
is looking to expand further in
India
as it is one of the
fastest growing market
for the company, BoConcept's Global CEO, Mikael Kruse Jensen told ET.
“India is overtaking some of the other growth markets that we have had. It keeps growing but it's not there in the top five yet,” the executive said.
The company has so far opened store in main cities but is considering going to tier 2 cities as well.
“Now we are actually going to go into uncharted territories when we started looking at markets which are not generally very conventional. We feel that there is a great opportunity that we want to explore and tap in these spaces. They have to often travel to cities like Delhi and Mumbai or Bangalore,” said Jensen.
Navin Khanna, Director of
BoConcept India
said that while doing PIN code analysis of buyer category, they identify fresh PIN code and number of sale happening from there.

Company currently has eight stores across six locations -Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Pune.
“We only had three stores before Covid, it was a difficult period for everyone but BoConcept took this as an opportunity. We were able to bargain some great locations,” said Khanna.
Jensen said that in some countries, the company changed the location of the store and it positively impacted the revenue.
“We have a few cities in mind. We are looking at expanding into at least a couple of them this financial year. There is a challenge in getting the right space and I think the challenge would be even higher in the smaller cities because of lack of infrastructure,” Khanna said.
The company has different manufacturing hub around the world. It has no plan to manufacture in India in the near future.
“India market will continue to grow. We really need to leverage our global presence and our global understanding of the brand and give all that knowledge to our partner in India which will help us grow,“ Jensen said.
In India, company’s consumer base is becoming more and more diverse.
“We used to always look at the upper segment of the society but today even working couple fancies our
furniture
and would like our furniture to be there in their houses. So I feel the customer base is ever expanding,” said Khanna.
BoConcept has 350 stores in over 65 countries around the world. It specializes in high quality furniture designs for the urban-minded consumer creating outstanding modern living spaces at affordable prices.

Future Retail's creditors extend voting timeline on SpaceMantra's bid to Sept 30,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/future-retails-creditors-extend-voting-timeline-on-spacemantras-bid-to-sept-30/articleshow/103739442.cms,18-09-2023,"Mumbai: The
committee of creditors
(CoC) to
Future Retail
(FRL) have extended the voting period for the third time to decide the winning bidder to acquire the
debt-laden company
. The timeline has now been extended till September 30 as lenders are still undecided whether to approve a very low offer from
SpaceMantra
or allow liquidation of
FRL
as there isn't enough time to seek fresh bids.
The decision was taken on Saturday after the second timeline ended on September 15, three people familiar with the developments said. The majority of the creditors have yet to decide on the takeover plan under consideration.
""Nobody is in a hurry to make a decision. Everyone is waiting for the other. Though some small bondholders have voted, the large financial creditors are still weighing options,"" said one of the persons cited above.
Kishore Biyani's flagship retail venture owes 38 creditors close to ₹20,000 crore. Bondholders, represented by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM), own 21% of the debt, or ₹4,109 crore, followed by
Bank of Baroda
at ₹1,826 crore or 9.24%,
Union Bank of India
at 9%, or ₹1,779 crore, and
Central Bank of India
at 8.38%, or ₹1,656 crore.
SpaceMantra, a retailer of construction, building materials and office furniture, is the sole bidder to take over FRL. Its offer of ₹553 crore comes to about 2.79% recovery for creditors.
Live Events
ET Online
Lenders are uncomfortable with the low offer, which is close to the liquidation value of the company. They are also sceptical of the valuations ascribed to the company since many of Future Retail's stores are currently inaccessible or have been taken over.
""Multiple lenders have raised questions on the process, specifically the valuations ascribed to the company, the assets position and the audit report but there is no clarity from resolution professional (RP) on how to go ahead,"" said the second person cited above.
Late last month, ET reported that
HDFC Bank
has opposed the decision of the RP Vijaykumar Iyer to put the plan to vote, alleging ""gross illegalities"" and ""procedural lapses"" in the resolution process.
HDFC has alleged that out of the 302 stores that were part of Future Retail assets when the insolvency process commenced, the RP didn't have access to 228 stores, which means that the current ascribed value is low. Other lenders have also accused the RP of failing to maximise value. Iyer didn't respond to an email seeking comment.
""This company was valued at more than ₹15,000 crore on various matrices - be it market cap, balance sheet or value of assets a few years ago. Banks cannot sign off on such a low offer because it will lead to questions later. There is still time and maybe banks can ask SpaceMantra to increase its offer or another bidder may emerge. Liquidation also cannot be ruled out,"" the third person said.
The outer resolution timeline for the case of 330 days ends on September 30. Beyond this, any extension will have to be approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
Bankers are also aware that the value of FRL's assets has been eroded as all the consumables inventory is past expiry and most of its stores have been taken over by Reliance Retail after their leases ran out. But they are also wary of any political fallout if they accept this low offer given the history of the account.

Reliance attracts luxury brands from Gucci to Louis Vuitton to its space amid India's economic boom,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/lvmh-gucci-to-expand-in-india-with-new-outlets-in-reliances-luxury-mall/articleshow/103686759.cms,15-09-2023,"Global luxury brands such as
Gucci
, Cartier, and
Louis Vuitton
, among others, have signed leases for retail spaces in a new Mumbai mall developed by Asia's richest
Mukesh Ambani
, as the brands and
Reliance Industries
look to tap lucrative prospects presented by India's robust economic growth and the swift increase in the number of millionaires.
Jio World Plaza is likely to open this year, Reuters said citing an unnamed source. The new mall is situated within
Reliance
Industries' extensive $1 billion business and cultural complex in Mumbai's bustling business district.
India is turning into a magnate for luxury brands. More than a dozen luxury consumer goods brands are entering the country ahead of the festive season, as they look to attract consumers in a market riding on the growing affluence of Indians with higher incomes, spurring greater discretionary spending even in small towns. The trend is being driven by increased exposure to global trends, younger people buying luxury products, and a post-pandemic boom, all of which are stoking interest from western luxury brands, executives said.
While a K-shaped economic recovery in India is also seen to be a strong trend, according to several economists, the Asian economy has beaten almost all countries in terms of rising wealth. Remember India is home for some of the world's richest including Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani.
For the first time since the global financial crisis of 2008, global household wealth in 2022, measured in US dollars, registered a collective decline both in nominal and real terms, encompassing aggregate and per-adult figures. Significantly, wealth per adult also saw its second-largest reduction since the turn of the century.

However, India was one of few that saw a wealth increase. Along with Russia, Mexico and Brazil, India also saw the largest wealth expansion.
While Reliance has yet to announce information about the tenants, lease agreements obtained from real estate analytics firm CRE Matrix reveal that Burberry Group, along with various brands under the umbrellas of
LVMH
, Kering, and
Richemont
, have committed to renting retail spaces within the mall. Additionally, these brands have agreed to share a percentage of their monthly net revenue with Reliance, ranging from 4% to 12%.
The brands include jewellers Cartier and Bulgari, fashion houses Louis Vuitton, Dior and Gucci, watch brand IWC Schaffhausen and luxury luggage maker Rimowa, which will open its first outlet in India, Reuters reported.
Reliance, Burberry, LVMH, Kering and Richemont did not respond to a request for comment.

""Luxury brands have always struggled for quality retail spaces in India and many were forced to open their first outlets in luxury hotels,"" said Anuj Kejriwal, CEO of India's Anarock Retail. ""These brands are now looking for meaningful presence.""
At almost 700 square metres (7,500 square feet), Louis Vuitton's Jio World Plaza store will be the most spacious of its four outlets in India. Cartier's store will be its second in the country and for Dior, it will be the third.
To ensure the mall retains its luxury appeal, some lease agreements like that of Dior include a clause that entitles it to a 25% rent reduction if at least four of 10 luxury brands including Gucci, Cartier, Bulgari and Tiffany don't open their own outlets in the mall within six months.
India's 1.4 billion population, the world's biggest, has a per capita income of just $2,300, but the country is also home to more than 800,000 dollar millionaires who are splashing out on everything from luxury homes to expensive SUVs.

India to see Rs 90K cr worth e-commerce sales in festive month this year,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-to-see-rs-90k-cr-worth-e-commerce-sales-in-festive-month-this-year/articleshow/103680270.cms,15-09-2023,"Driven by about 140 million shoppers,
India
is likely to witness Rs 90,000 crore worth online gross merchandise value (
GMV
) in the
festive month
this year -- up 18-20 per cent from last year's festive month sales, a report showed on Friday.
Marking the 10th year of e-commerce festive season sales, the industry is expected to clock the GMV of Rs 5,25,000 crore for the entire year, according to the report by
market research
firm Redseer Strategy Consultants.
Over the last 10 years, Indian e-tailing has transformed almost entirely as the annual GMV for the overall e-tailing industry has grown almost 20 times in the period.
The 10th festive season sale period is even more significant this year considering the recent slowdown in consumption and the almost 3 years of external shocks on the economy, the report mentioned.
""Over the last several quarters, we are seeing enhanced GMV contributions from categories beyond electronics. This is good for the ecosystem as it shows consumers' willingness to purchase multiple categories online and more brands coming to cater to their needs,"" said Mrigank Gutgutia, Partner at Redseer.

Continuing with this trend, ""we expect increasing GMV contributions from non-electronics categories like fashion, beauty and personal care, home and general merchandise and more this festive period"", Gutgutia added.
There is persistent ""premiumisation"" leading to rising average selling prices (ASPs), and increasing ads and promotion revenues will possibly make this year's festive season the most efficient from a margin perspective, according to the report.
Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands are likely to grow 1.6 times as fast as the broader e-tailing market.
In terms of city-tier wise growth, metros have been growing faster than tier 1 and 2 the last few quarters.
""However, we expect robust growth across city tiers this festive season,"" said the report.
Additionally, new-age technology solutions like generative AI being more widely adopted in multiple use-cases during the sale period will also lead to better and novel consumer experiences and drive stronger growth momentum, it added.

In 2019, Reliance Brands, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, successfully acquired the British toy retailer Hamleys for GBP 67.96 million (approximately Rs 620 crore then) in an all-cash transaction.
Established in London in 1760, Hamleys stands as one of the world's oldest toy retailers, having changed ownership several times over the years.
Hamleys continues its expansion into new markets, most notably the Balkans, with its inaugural stores in Albania and Kosovo, while also extending its presence in existing regions like India and the Middle East with a new store in Qatar.
Going beyond the iconic London toy emporium, Hamleys, as a global brand, currently operates in 15 countries, with 191 stores across the UK, India, UAE, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and other nations.
“Giochi Preziosi is extremely delighted with the conclusion of the exclusive franchising agreement with the iconic Hamleys brand and is very excited with the launch of the first store in Milan and looking forward to the upcoming projects lined up and to continue with the Retail development plan in the Country over the years ahead.” said Enrico Preziosi, founder of Giochi Preziosi Group.

Reliance Retail is India's largest retailer and is led by Asia's richest person Mukesh Ambani. The talks with investors are part of an internal target to raise $3.5 billion which the company wants to close by the end September, Reuters has reported. Of that,
QIA
last month announced a $1 billion investment and KKR & Co this week $250 million.
Singapore's
GIC
, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (
ADIA
) and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (
PIF
) are looking to invest at least $500 million each in Reliance Retail at a valuation of $100 billion, one of the sources told Reuters.
GIC, ADIA declined to comment, while PIF did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Reliance said: ""we do not comment on media speculation and rumours"".
A second source said some of the three investors could end up putting in less than $500 million, and talks were also on with at least one or two further investors for the fund raising.

""All the three investors have evaluated the company quite seriously,"" said the first of the three sources, all of whom declined to be named as the discussions are private.
The final investments or funding plans could still change.
GIC, PIF and ADIA are among the world's biggest investment funds and together they own a 4.4% stake in the Indian retailer.
Reliance Industries, the retail arm's parent, also has plans to invest in the ongoing fund raising round of $3.5 billion, two of the sources said.
Reliance sold a 10.09% stake in its retail unit in 2020, valuing it at 4.68 trillion rupees ($56.4 billion). At that time, GIC and ADIA invested $664 million each, while PIF pumped in $1.15 billion, based on current exchange rates.
A fourth source briefed on the dealmaking said the 2020 fund raising agreements had a clause that allowed existing investors to increase their stakes, and those investment funds were showing keen interest.
Ambani's Indian retail empire has more than 18,000 stores, with operations ranging from groceries to electronics. It includes foreign partnerships with brands such as Marks and Spencer and competes with Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart in one of the world's biggest markets.
When ADIA invested in Reliance Retail in 2020, it said it was part of its strategy of targeting market leading businesses in Asia linked to the region's consumption-driven growth.
Last month Ambani said in a speech that ""several marquee global strategic and financial investors have shown strong interest"" in his company, but gave no names. In 2019, the billionaire said his group planned to list the retail business in five years.
Reliance Retail reported a consolidated net profit of 91.81 billion rupees ($1.11 billion) for the financial year that ended in March 2023, on revenue of 2.6 trillion rupees. It has also forayed into the consumer goods business, which will compete with likes of Coca-Cola and Unilever.

KKR
is investing another ₹2,069.5 crore through an affiliate in
Reliance Retail Ventures
(
RRVL
), holding company for the retail businesses of
Reliance Industries
(
RIL
).
KKR's follow-on investment will translate into an additional equity stake of 0.25% in RRVL, according to a press release issued on Monday, which added that this takes the private equity giant's holding to 1.42%.
This round of fundraising has increased RRVL's valuation to around ₹8.36 lakh crore, from ₹8.28 lakh crore, when
Qatar Investment Authority
invested ₹8,278 crore less than three weeks ago.
RIL said this puts
Reliance
Retail Ventures on the list of the country's top four companies by equity value.
ET on August 25 reported that Reliance Industries is likely to sell a fresh round of 8-10% in RRVL to fund expansion, retire debt and prepare for the unit's initial public offering, which would take total stake sold to 19-21%.

Global interest
The stake sale is crucial because at the current valuation, RRVL's IPO size will be too large for the current liquidity to absorb.
At a recent annual general meeting, Reliance Industries chairman and managing director
Mukesh Ambani
said several global investors had shown keen interest in the conglomerate's retail business.
The latest investment by KKR comes primarily from its Asian Fund IV. In 2020, KKR invested Rs 5,550 crore in Reliance Retail Ventures. At that time, RRVL raised Rs 47,265 crore from various global investors at a valuation of Rs 4.21 lakh crore.
At present, around 11% in RRVL is owned by global investors, over 88% by Reliance Industries and the rest by small investors.
RRVL director
Isha Mukesh Ambani
said the company values the deepening partnership with KKR, and that the latest investment reinforces its strong belief in the company's vision and capabilities. ""We look forward to continued engagement with KKR and to benefit from their global platform, industry knowledge and operational expertise, in our journey towards driving transformation of the Indian retail sector,"" she said.
Reliance Retail Ventures, through its subsidiaries and associates, operates India's largest, fastest-growing and most profitable retail business, serving 267 million customers with an integrated omni-channel network of over 18,500 stores and ecommerce platforms across grocery, consumer electronics, fashion and lifestyle, and medicines.

LuLu Group
International
Yusuff Ali
on Monday said his group is going to set up two large shopping malls in India - Ahmedabad and Chennai.
Speaking to ANI, Ali said, ""We are going to construct one of the largest shopping malls in Ahmedabad and Chennai and we are opening our shopping mall in Hyderabad end of this month. Also we are going to different states for shopping malls and food processing.""
Hyderabad will be the sixth city after Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru, Lucknow, and Coimbatore where the group has its shopping mall presence.
Lulu Group, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, UAE, has been known as a trendsetter in the retail industry in the Middle East and North Africa region. It operates over 250 hypermarkets and supermarkets and is immensely popular with discerning shoppers across the GCC, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event where over two dozen Memoranda of Understanding were signed between India and Saudi Arabia companies, ranging from Information Technology, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and human resources, among other sectors, he said the relationship between India and Saudi Arabia will increase as it is historical.
Live Events
""A lot of liberalization happened and ease of doing business happened... A lot of restrictions are removed by the Prime Minister and the government. We are very thankful to him,"" Ali said.
The signing of the MoUs happened as Saudi Arabian Prime Minister and Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud
began his State visit after having participated in the G20 Summit in New Delhi. The Saudi Crown Prince arrived in Delhi on a three-day visit on Saturday and stayed back after the G20 Summit for his state visit.
""So this historical visit has further strengthened the bilateral commercial and the leadership relation,"" the Lulu Group chief told ANI.
On India's G20 presidency, Ali said, ""India is a global leader and we should congratulate our prime minister Narendra Modi ji for his hard work and bringing all the leaders here. And India's tradition, India's culture also showed to the great leaders of different countries.""
Lulu Group employs more than 65,000- plus strong workforce from 42 different nations and has an annual turnover of USD 8 billion globally.

Government cracks down on online shopping platforms for deceptive design patterns,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/government-cracks-down-on-online-shopping-platforms-for-deceptive-design-patterns/articleshow/103574133.cms,11-09-2023,"Online shopping
sites have come under scrutiny for employing deceptive
design
techniques that sneak unwanted items or donations into users' shopping baskets. These practices, known as ""dark patterns,"" utilize user interface and user experience (UI/UX) interactions to mislead consumers, potentially violating their rights.
The Ministry of Consumer Affairs has taken note of this issue and has issued a discussion paper proposing new guidelines to curb the proliferation of dark patterns. These patterns are designed to manipulate users into taking actions they did not originally intend to or coercing them into certain actions.
Kailash Nadh, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Zerodha, expressed support for these proposed guidelines. Talking to TOI, he described dark patterns as predatory practices that border on exploitation and recognized the need for a human-centric legal framework to address this issue. Nadh also drew a parallel with the importance of net neutrality in the technology sector.
A spokesperson for
Zomato
, acknowledged the importance of curbing deceptive or misleading patterns to create a safe and trustworthy online environment for consumers.
Dark patterns encompass a range of tactics, including creating a false sense of urgency or scarcity to prompt users to make immediate purchases. For example, an online shopping site may falsely indicate that there are only a few items of a product or limited seats on a plane available, pressuring users to act quickly.

One specific dark pattern known as ""basket sneaking"" involves stealthily adding additional items, such as products, services, or donations to charity, during the checkout process without the user's explicit consent. This results in the total amount payable by the user being higher than what they intended to pay for the selected products or services.
Regulators in the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and the United Kingdom (UK) have taken action against such unfair practices, recognizing the need to protect consumers from deceptive design patterns that can lead to unintended purchases or financial burdens.
The discussion paper from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs signals a growing awareness of the importance of safeguarding consumer rights in the digital age, particularly in the realm of e-commerce and online transactions. It remains to be seen how these proposed guidelines will be implemented and how they will impact the online shopping landscape in India.

Proposed tax on international card purchases may drive sale of luxury brands in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/proposed-tax-on-international-card-purchases-may-drive-sale-of-luxury-brands-in-india/articleshow/103559492.cms,11-09-2023,"New Delhi: The government’s proposal to impose a 20% tax on expenditures made abroad under the
Liberalised Remittance Scheme
, in case of amounts exceeding Rs 7 lakh in a financial year from October 1, is likely to push the sale of
luxury brands
in India, experts said.
Covid had helped boost demand for luxury brands in India as international travel restrictions shifted sales to domestic stores. That is now set to get another boost due to narrowing of the price gap between foreign and local markets after accounting for the 20% tax collected at source (
TCS
), mall owners said.
“An Indian consumer earlier used to go abroad and shop in Dubai or London, but when the pandemic happened, many of those brands like
Chanel
or
Hermes
called their Indian consumers to do small events inside the store. There are customers who come for the first time to the brand’s store in India and realise the price difference is hardly 15%. Millennials also prefer luxury brands, leading to the growth,” said Pushpa Bector, senior executive director at DLF Retail that operates premium malls across the Delhi-National Capital Region.
Global luxury brands are also bullish on the Indian market. Recently,
Aditya Birla
Fashion Retail partnered with French luxury department store chain Galeries Lafayette, while Reliance Brands signed a deal to bring global luxury brands Valentino and Balenciaga to India.
“Every luxury brand is available in India so why should anybody need to go abroad for shopping. Travel should be experiential. Many of the brands at our luxury mall have reported triple growth in revenue since Covid and we expect that to continue,” said Uzma Irfan, director of Bengaluru-based Prestige Group that operates the UB City mall that houses brands such as Louis Vuitton, Rolex, Rado and Jimmy Choo.
Live Events
Experts said with the new rule, the difference in the price of a luxury product in India and abroad will reduce, prompting buyers to do the shopping in India.
“The prices in India will now be at par with the global prices, which will work in favour of the outlets here. Although there is an import duty, the brands usually keep the prices similar to ensure the buyer is buying at the home country store. The Indian shoppers will keep the Rs 7 lakh limit for other purposes instead of buying goods that are available in India,” said Shriram PM Monga, who cofounded retail consultancy firm SRED.
As per a Bain & Co report, India’s luxury market is expected to reach $85 billion-$90 billion by 2030, propelled by a rising number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (with net assets of $30 million or more), growing entrepreneurship, strong middle class, greater penetration of ecommerce and demand from tier-2 and -3 cities.
Tax experts have also called for a reduction in the overall tax on luxury goods to further boost sales.
India imposed a 28% GST, the highest rate under the tax system, on most luxury goods.
“This has resulted in making luxury goods expensive in India. GST on luxury leather goods is 28% and this is over and above the customs duty of 10-15%. Hence the average tax rate on luxury leather goods becomes around 40%. Till the time these are not pruned, the TCS of 20% may not yield the intended results,” said Vivek Jalan, partner, Tax Connect Advisory, a tax consultancy firm.
The 20% TCS on foreign transactions was earlier meant to be effective 1 July, but later postponed to be applicable from October 1.

Coffee Day stares at corporate insolvency over bond defaults,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/coffee-day-stares-at-corporate-insolvency-over-bond-defaults/articleshow/103519152.cms,09-09-2023,"Alternative investment manager
Ares SSG Capital Management
has filed an application with the Bengaluru bankruptcy tribunal to admit Coffee Day Enterprises for
corporate insolvency
over its ₹228-crore bond default, people aware of the development told ET. The global fund filed the application through
IDBI Trusteeship
.
Coffee Day Enterprises (CDEL) informed the exchange about the insolvency application filed by IDBI Trusteeship without naming the bondholder. CDEL is
Coffee Day Global
's holding company that operates the
Cafe Coffee Day
chain.
On March 31, 2022, CDEL had defaulted on ₹115.37 crore of bond payments to Credit Opportunities II Pte and ₹116.55 crore to India Special Situation Scheme, both funds of Ares SSG Capital.
Coffee Day Global was admitted for corporate insolvency by the National Company Law Tribunal, Bengaluru, on July 20 on an application filed by
IndusInd Bank
. However, the appellate tribunal stayed the process until the next hearing which is scheduled on September 20, as reported by ET on August 11.
According to the people cited earlier, at least three of CDEL's lenders have sold their debt to different asset reconstruction companies (ARC) after a failed attempt to restructure the company's debt.

G20 Summit: Supply chain disruption may impact mobile phone shipments and sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/g20-summit-supply-chain-disruption-may-impact-mobile-phone-shipments-and-sales/articleshow/103481728.cms,08-09-2023,"Smartphone retailers are apprehensive of a potential disruption in supply of devices in the next 7-10 days due to the
G20 Summit
in
Delhi
. Some New Delhi-based retailers have also started seeing fewer footfalls because of ramped up security in the city and its neighbourhoods, impacting sales.
""The event is expected to impact the supply chains of various brands whose stocks are sourced from Noida and Delhi factories. As a result, there may be delays in receiving mobile phone shipments during this period,"" the
All India Mobile Retailers Association
that represents 1,50,000 mobile phone retailers across the country told its members.
The retailer body advised retailers to closely monitor their stock levels and take appropriate measures to capitalise on this situation. ""By actively promoting and incentivising the sale of ageing inventory, as well as the hot-selling products covered by MOP (Minimum Operating Price) and insurance, you can maximise your profits during this period,"" the association said in an advisory.
A New Delhi-based retailer with two stores in the city said there has been a decline in footfalls in the markets he operates in due to heightened security and removal of street vendors. ""In the past few days, my sales have been slower due to less people coming to the markets to shop as most street vendors have been removed. As a result, my sales are down slightly compared to a week before,"" the retailer said.

G20 Summit: Quick-commerce companies staff up to meet demand spike,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/g20-summit-quick-commerce-companies-staff-up-to-meet-demand-spike/articleshow/103481565.cms,08-09-2023,"New Delhi: With most professionals working from home in the National Capital Territory and with schools and colleges shut due to the
G20 Summit
,
quick-commerce companies
are expecting a spike in demand for deliveries in these three days.
The likely surge in deliveries will also translate to at least a 20% rise in demand for last-mile
delivery personnel
during the period of the G20 event, say executives. Deliveries are restricted though in the New Delhi district due to security reasons, translating into losses for business communities including
quick-commerce
companies in that zone.
According to staffing firms that provide manpower to ecommerce, quick-commerce and foodtech companies, the
surge in demand
for workers could go upwards of 20% in the NCR in these three days compared to any other week, mostly from quick commerce.
A spokesperson for quick-commerce company Zepto confirmed this.
“With most people working remotely and movement restrictions in place, we anticipate a significant surge in demand, with a 30-40% rise in New Delhi and over 10% in other NCR cities compared to normal days,” the spokesperson said in response to ET’s queries.

According to staffing firm
TeamLease Services
, quick-commerce companies are stocking in anticipation.
“We are anticipating a demand uptick of 30-40% over the extended weekend. Due to this there will be an increase of 20% in short-term hiring around delivery roles,” said Kartik Narayan, CEO-staffing,
TeamLease
Services.
TeamLease is currently hiring based on its customers requirement for short-term needs, which include both gig and flexi staff.
“We see quick-commerce companies getting ready for an overall surge of 20-30%,” said Aditya Mishra, chief executive at CIEL HR Services. These companies have prepared plans based on the customer data for each zone in the NCR and accordingly staffed and stocked up the warehouses, he said.
Meanwhile, quick-commerce companies have instructed their employees to not take leave, be ready for extra workload, provide proper response to irate customers in case of delays in delivery, follow traffic advisories such as on diversions, and keep documents handy in case authorities ask for that while on the road, etc.
Zepto is significantly increasing its inventory in New Delhi and other NCR cities. It has also secured the necessary approvals from authorities to supply daily replenishable items like dairy and vegetables, the spokesperson said.
For these three days, Zepto has blocked the restricted routes in its navigation systems and relocated some riders from high-impact zones to other stores. “Additionally, control towers have been set up to support riders with on-ground concerns, if any,” said the spokesperson.
Zomato shared a statement on G20 which stated, ""We will be fully operational for our customers in Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad, throughout the G20 Summit … We will also be operational in all of Delhi, except only for the small part of the NDMC area where the G20 Summit is being hosted.""
In its response, a Swiggy spokesperson said: ""We look forward to serving our customers in the Delhi-NCR region except in zones where movement is restricted as per government’s directives.”

To accept only bid for Future Retail or not? Lenders differ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/to-accept-only-bid-for-future-retail-or-not-lenders-differ/articleshow/103481516.cms,08-09-2023,"Mumbai:
Lenders
to the debt-laden
Future Retail
have extended by a week the deadline to vote on the sole plan for a takeover of the company as their ranks remain decidedly split on choosing the best method for recovering dues totalling about ₹20,000 crore.
Some
banks
are opposed to taking up the
resolution plan
submitted by
SpaceMantra
as it is too close to the liquidation value, while some others are inclined to accept the only offer on the table.
Voting
was supposed to end on Thursday but has now probably been extended until September 15, people familiar with the process said.
""The
voting timeline
has been extended until the 12th, with an enabling resolution to extend it further until the 15th. None of the banks have voted so far; everyone is deliberating their next move,"" said a person familiar with the process. ""Banks need time to take internal approvals, but specifically in this case, no one is in a hurry to make a decision.""
SpaceMantra, a retailer of
construction
, building material and office furniture, is the sole bidder to take over Future Retail, which owes ₹19,773 crore to financial creditors. Space Mantra's offer of ₹553 crore comes to a 2.79% recovery for creditors.
Lenders are not comfortable with the poor recovery on offer, with some even questioning the plan.

Last week ET reported that
HDFC Bank
has opposed the decision of resolution professional (RP) Vijaykumar Iyer to put the plan to vote, alleging ""gross illegalities"" and ""procedural lapses"" in the resolution process. The bank has accused the RP of failing in his duty to maximise value for financial creditors. HDFC Bank also alleged that out of the 302 stores that were part of the Future Retail assets when the insolvency process commenced, the RP did not have access to 228 stores.
Lenders Divided
""There are some lenders who do not want to go ahead with this resolution plan and have expressed reservations openly. A part of their problem is that if they dissent they end up getting nothing,"" said a second person aware of the process. ""But there are only two options before the committee of creditors (CoC): Either go with this plan or liquidate the company, which will be another process. It has been more than a year since the company is undergoing this process; so there is not much time left, too.""
RP VijayKumar Iyer did not reply to an email seeking comment.
Lenders want to avoid selling the company cheap so close to the liquidation value, to prevent any conspiracy theories later.
""The fact that this bidder is a little-known company has raised doubts on whether it is bidding on behalf of someone else. SpaceMantra claims it has a buyer for these assets and also promised the full amount to lenders within three months even if it fails to realise the expected value,"" said a third person aware of the plan.
""The fact is that there is very little room to delay the process now. Unless there is a very solid reason like the emergence of a new applicant, which looks unlikely,"" said a fourth person aware of the process. ""There is a big possibility of this account being liquidated as banks will not want to take a chance at selling it so cheap and risk inquiries later.""

E-commerce rules shouldn’t stunt sector’s growth: IACC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ecommerce-rules-shouldnt-stunt-sectors-growth-iacc/articleshow/103472051.cms,08-09-2023,"New Delhi: The Indo-American Chambers of Commerce (
IACC
) on Thursday said that any policy or regulation for the e-commerce sector must ensure that its growth is not stunted in any manner. In a statement, the chamber said that the new e-commerce policy will “hopefully be in sync” with the existing laws such as the
Digital Data Protection Act
without increasing the compliance burden.
It said that any policy or regulation for the e-commerce sector must ensure that its growth is not stunted in any manner, and that policymaking for e-commerce should be a carefully calibrated effort to incentivise investment, boost innovation, and encourage competition.
“And the way to ensure that the policy and rules are positive is by finalising them only after consensus has emerged through transparent and open consultation with all the relevant stakeholders,” the chamber said, adding that e-commerce has a multiplier effect on economic growth, job creation, export orientation, and consumer empowerment.
While the policy has been long awaited by industry, consumers and other stakeholders, it is notable that the last draft of the e-commerce policy was made public four years ago, prior to the pandemic, the lobby group said that recently no draft has been shared with the public, including industry, of the current version of the policy.
“…without a draft, it may be difficult to industry and stakeholders alike to comment on the provisions the proposed policy aims to put in place to unlock growth in this key sunrise sector,” it said.

As per the statement, e-commerce has emerged as an “amazing market access tool” and is “building resilience in retail and allied sectors against unforeseen crises – including future pandemics”.
It said that the e-commerce sector is at once humongous and multi-dimensional in impact and benefits and such a sector must be nurtured and promoted with extreme care.
E-commerce has had a lifestyle-altering impact on
Indian consumers
because it has empowered them through the ability to browse a wide range of affordable products and services, choose from amongst several convenient payment options, and have the products delivered at their doorstep, no matter where they live, according to the statement.

The Japanese brand posted a net profit of Rs 68.38 crore with net revenues of Rs624.6 crore, according to its latest filing with the Registrar of Companies. A year ago, it had a profit of 21.4 crore with sales of Rs391.7 crore.
""Indians like affordable pricing but high quality clothing. We want to be in India for 100 years and don't have a short term vision in store numbers and sales targets. We are not just chasing fashion. Store target number is not our purpose and product quality is the main focus,"" Tomohiko Sei, chief executive officer,

The Japanese brand opened its first door in the country in September 2019, but stringent
lockdown measures
announced in March 2020 to contain the
Covid-19 outbreak
delayed its store expansion plans, restricting its store count to about ten outlets so far. The retailer is now opening two stores in Mumbai over the next two months.

Sales of organised retail segments grew 34% during FY22-23 compared to pre-pandemic (FY20), largely driven by quick service restaurants, sporting goods and electronics, a report by RetailersAssociation of India (RAI) has said.

stores in India, saw revenue expand to Rs 2562.5 crore last fiscal, according to Trent’s annual report. Net profit rose 77% to Rs 264 crore in FY23.
Over the past decade, global brands Zara and H&M have become market leaders in the fast fashion segment in India. Uniqlo has said India is one of the most priority markets where consumers are increasingly shifting from ‘fast-fashion’ to long-lasting essentials and functional wear.
As the world’s second most-populated country, India is an attractive market for apparel brands, especially with youngsters increasingly embracing western-style clothing. Uniqlo is globally popular for functional basics like T-shirts, jeans and woollen wear, unlike fast-fashion rivals which are associated with designs that move quickly from the catwalk to the showroom. Both Zara and H&M stock fast fashion items created in-house and team up with designers for one-time collections. They keep a large inventory of basic, everyday items sourced from places including India and Bangladesh that carry a lower price tag than most of their rivals.Mumbai
Uniqlo, Asia's biggest clothing brand, has posted a 69% increase in sales while net profit nearly tripled for its Indian unit during the year ended March 2013.
The Japanese brand posted a net profit of Rs 68.38 crore with net revenues of Rs624.6 crore, according to its latest filing with the Registrar of Companies. A year ago, it had a profit of 21.4 crore with sales of Rs391.7 crore.
""Indians like affordable pricing but high quality clothing. We want to be in India for 100 years and don't have a short term vision in store numbers and sales targets. We are not just chasing fashion. Store target number is not our purpose and product quality is the main focus,"" Tomohiko Sei, chief executive officer, Uniqlo India told ET last month.
The Japanese brand opened its first door in the country in September 2019, but stringent lockdown measures announced in March 2020 to contain the Covid-19 outbreak delayed its store expansion plans, restricting its store count to about ten outlets so far. The retailer is now opening two stores in Mumbai over the next two months.

RRVL
) has signed a joint venture with Alia Bhatt’s clothing brand of kids and maternity wear, Ed-a-Mamma for a 51% majority stake.
ET was the first to report on July 17 on the possible acquisition. Launched in 2020, Bhatt has extended the kids brand into teenage and maternity wear segments as well.
“With sustainability as its core proposition the brand has garnered acclaim for its meticulous attention to detail, using ethically sourced materials and eco-conscious production processes. This aligns seamlessly with
Reliance Brands
' vision of fostering a more responsible future for the fashion industry,” said Isha Ambani, Director, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd.

As per media reports, Ed-a-Mamma is an over Rs 150 crore brand and is sold primarily through online shopping platforms. The move will help Reliance to have a strong portfolio in the kids wear segment where it currently operates mainly through value fashion retail chain, Trends and Mothercare whose rights it has acquired for India.
Live Events
“We discussed what we are doing at Ed-a-Mamma and Isha there’s scope to do so much more. She said Reliance can bring strengths in everything from supply chain to retail to marketing. With this joint venture, we look forward to taking Ed-a-Mamma to many more kids and parents,” said Alia Bhatt.

Shoppers Stop
.
The market for kids' apparel in India exceeds Rs 13,000 crore, of which around Rs 3,000 crore is constituted by branded kids' wear. The kids' wear market is growing at the rate of 10% per annum, which makes it one of the fastest growing apparel segments in the country.
Reliance Brands is Reliance Retail’s venture which partners with independent fashion brands in segments like luxury, bridge-to-luxury, high-premium and high-street lifestyle such as
Armani Exchange
, Burberry, Bally, Canali, Diesel, Gas, Hugo Boss, Hamleys, Jimmy Choo, amongst others. The acquisition of Ed-a-Mamma will help it to further consolidate presence in the high-street kidswear segment.

shopping malls
have seen a sharp recovery in sales across pricepoints in the past few weeks during
Raksha Bandhan
and Onam, raising hopes of strong demand this festive season even though mass segments in electronics and auto stay under pressure.
Retailers said the recent sales trend indicates a normal festive period ahead for apparel and discretionary segments that had been struggling for almost a year now.
“The last few months have been challenging, but we are now seeing single-digit same-store sales,” said
Devarajan Iyer
, chief executive of department store chain
Lifestyle International
. “We have also managed our inventory for the festive season after gauging this demand boost.”
The festive season starts with Onam and covers Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali and Bhai Dooj.
“Onam sales have been strong and our recently opened mall, Forum Kochi, at Maradu has reported best-ever sales and footfall than any mall we have opened so far,” said Muhammad Ali, CEO of Forum Malls, promoted by
Prestige Group
Bengaluru-based developer Prestige Group. “In Benguluru also, sales momentum has started, and we expect to overcome the last few month’s slowdown during the long festive season,” he said.

Bigger inventory in small cars but higher discounts unlikely; expect strong festive season: Shashank Srivastava, Maruti Suzuki
Consumers started reducing non-essential spending such as that on apparel, lifestyle products, electronics and dining out since Diwali last year due to inflation, increase in interest rates, job losses in sectors like startups and IT, and an overall slowdown in the economy.
Over the past 6-8 months, most companies have been either slashing price tags or offering steep discounts to clear unsold inventory after price increases across all apparel categories last year.
Retail sales across categories grew 9% year on year in July, while apparel sales rose 8%, industry association Retailers Association of India (RAI) said.

Reliance opens Metro's gates for all consumers to further strengthen its retail dominance,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-opens-metros-gates-for-all-consumers-to-further-strengthen-its-retail-dominance/articleshow/103383976.cms,05-09-2023,"Mukesh and Isha Ambani-led
Reliance Retail
’s consumer business dominance ambitions have received a fillip as they opened the gates of
Metro
Cash & Carry for everyone and it is not just restricted to business-to-business customers.
Metro’s business traditionally catered to B2B customers.
ET on Tuesday reported
that since the company is now an Indian entity, following
Reliance Retail Ventures’ Rs 2,850 crore deal
with Metro AG, it need not comply with the foreign direct investment (FDI) norms.
RRVL
in December 2022 acquired a 100% stake in Metro Cash & Carry, a wholesale distributor that launched operations in India in 2003.
RIL
only recently got a regulatory nod and is currently integrating the business with its own.
Synergies and maximisation
Reliance got access to Metro’s 31 wholesale distribution centres across the country. Alongside its consumer push, RRVL will continue doing wholesale business from its Metro outlets for B2B customers to fulfil its 'new commerce' ambition of wholesale supplies of products to smaller stores in grocery, electronics and apparel.
Live Events
Reliance Retail operates 52 B2B outlets under the ‘Reliance Market’ brand of stores, catering to Kiranas and other institutional customers.
Industry executives told ET that the company will have a ladder pricing strategy for Metro stores whereby more discounts will be offered for higher quantity sold, bulk packs apart from selling wholesale packs.
RIL’s acquisition of Metro AG’s India business was welcomed by analysts as they believe it gives RRVL access to Metro's warehousing assets in tier 1 & 2 cities and to its strong supplier network, Bernstein said in a report.
Using B2B to push grocery biz
Reliance, like its peer Rakesh Damani-led Avenue Supermarkets, has smelled an opportunity in India’s retail market, which is majorly controlled by unorganised players. And within this, lies the food & grocery market. Reliance is looking to tap into Metro’s capabilities to further enhance its footprint in this particular segment.
Metro sells products such as fruits and vegetables, general groceries, electronics, household goods and apparel to clients like hotels, and restaurants as well as offices and companies, small retailers and Kirana stores. Brokerage firm ICICIdirect in a note said that it expects Reliance’s Metro acquisition to further strengthen Reliance Retail’s backend supply chain and accelerate growth in JioMart Kirana orders by on-boarding new clients in hotels, restaurants, and cafe categories.
""Metro will focus on grocery new commerce business and also expand B2B supplies to kiranas, merchants, small stores and others in categories like electronics and apparel,"" an industry executive told ET.
Analysts say that Reliance is using traditional and eB2B models in an aggressive manner to capture Kirana stores, to tap into the opportunity in India’s unorganised retail segment. “Over 2/3rds of its network stores are in tier-2/3 cities. 75 per cent of store launches were in tier-2 and below towns. Reliance is looking to generate stickiness in these geographies,” Bernstein said.
Reliance aimed to gain significantly through its acquisition of Kishore Biyani-led
Future Enterprises
, but that fizzled out and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the company for corporate insolvency. However, in March 2022,
Reliance took possession of the premises housing some 900
Future Retail stores citing non-payment of rent. Reliance went on to rebrand these stores as Reliance outlets. This transaction would’ve enabled Reliance to sell its products across 1,500 of Future’s outlets in the country.
It aims to do the same now through its Metro deal. Reliance’s retail business has a strong portfolio and these outlets can help the company market a host of products, exclusively.
Reliance Retail today is the largest organised retailer in the nation and is showing no signs of slowing down.
Reliance’s consumer business growth
Analysts expected the B2B of Metro to support Reliance Retail’s new commerce strategy and expand its presence in urban cities with large format multi-category stores. “With $1 billion in bolt-on acquisitions in retail and the recent launch of its own brand, we expect RIL to remain aggressive in its retail strategy,” Morgan Stanley had said in December.
Even though Metro launched operations nearly two decades ago, it couldn’t expand its footprint significantly over the last 5-7 years. Analysts opined that RIL has the requisite tools, i.e., supply chain networks, technology platforms and sourcing capabilities to turn it into a profitable segment.

Reliance Retail opens Metro Cash & Carry stores to all; to also continue wholesale biz from outlets for B2B customers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-opens-metro-cash-carry-stores-to-all-to-also-continue-wholesale-biz-from-outlets-for-b2b-customers/articleshow/103368703.cms,05-09-2023,"Kolkata:
Reliance Retail
has opened the recently acquired
Metro
Cash & Carry stores to all. Earlier, Metro outlets were only for business-to-business customers, but as an Indian entity
Reliance
did not need to comply with the foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, two senior industry executives said.
The FDI norms for cash and carry only allows foreign companies to sell to B2B customers through stores and online in India. Reliance will also continue to do wholesale business from these outlets for B2B customers to fulfill its 'new commerce' ambition of wholesale supplies of products to smaller stores in grocery, electronics and apparel.
The company will have a ladder pricing strategy for Metro stores whereby more discounts will be offered for higher quantity sold, bulk packs apart from selling wholesale packs, the executives said.
Reliance is going to start expansion of the business which will continue to run under the Metro brand name for a couple of years under the deal. It has opened a new store in Patiala, will convert a few of its existing dark stores for new and e-commerce into such outlets, and organically build some newer ones with plans to open 40 such new stores in the next few months, the executives said.
An email sent to Reliance Retail remained unanswered till Monday press time.

The deal recently received regulatory clearance and Reliance is currently integrating the business.
""Metro will focus on grocery new commerce business and also expand B2B supplies to kiranas, merchants, small stores and others in categories like electronics and apparel,"" said one of the executives quoted above.

Indian toy industry can learn from expertise of G20 members to boost manufacturing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indian-toy-industry-can-learn-from-expertise-of-g20-members-to-boost-manufacturing/articleshow/103346205.cms,04-09-2023,"Expertise of G20 member countries such as the US and China can help the Indian toy industry boost
domestic manufacturing
capabilities and exports, according to the sector experts. Toy Association of
India
(
TAI
) Chairman Manu Gupta said the G20 presidency with India provides an opportunity to showcase India as an attractive investment destination.
""In G20 we have both, the biggest producers and consumers of toys in the world. From the US, India can learn about improving per capita consumption of toys as they are excellent learning tools for kids,"" Gupta said.
He added that the US has a strong toy market, and studying their strategies and approaches can help India increase toy consumption among its population.
On the other hand, Gupta said China is known as the world's toy factory, and India can certainly leverage its existing strengths, such as its workforce and technological abilities, to enhance the toy manufacturing capabilities.
""Learning from China's expertise in mass production, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness can contribute to the growth and competitiveness of India's toy manufacturing industry,"" he added.

Senior Vice President of TAI and Little Genius Toys Pvt Ltd CEO Naresh Kumar Gautam said India holds a huge potential in the toy sector as it has both skilled manpower and technology to cater to demands of the international market.
Gautam said the government here is taking several measures to increase competitiveness of manufacturers.
""The upcoming toy cluster in Greater Noida is going to provide a huge boost to manufacturing. About 135 companies have been allowed land for units,"" he added.
Further, Gupta said as most of the G20 countries are net importer of toys, it presents a huge opportunity for domestic players.
G20 has 43 members and not 20 countries. These include 19 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkiye, the UK and US) and the European Union (27-member group). Three EU countries - France, Germany, Italy - are double counted.
Share of G20 nations in India's merchandise export was 64 per cent and import was 52.4 per cent in 2022.
India's leading export destinations among G20 nations in 2022 were the US( USD 91 billion), the EU (USD 87 billion), China (USD 17.5 billion), the UK (USD 14.4 billion), Turkiye (USD 10.7 billion), Saudi Arabia (USD 10 billion).
The country's leading import suppliers last year included China (USD 118.5 billion), the EU( USD 59.1 billion), Saudi Arabia(USD 43.3 billion), the US ( USD 38.4 billion), Russia (USD 34 billion), Australia (USD 19.2 billion), Korea (USD 18.9 billion), and Japan (USD 13.9 billion).
In terms of foreign direct investments (FDI), the US is the biggest investor with USD 61.3 billion or nine per cent share in India's
FDI
during April 2000 - June 2023 when it aggregated at USD 645.4 billion.

At present, the experience with the loyalty points and
rewards system
in India is broken with millions of such shopping points lying unutilised in various shopping cards. The idea is to collate all the points and convert those into real money so that the end customer can use it wherever and whenever they want. Consumets can redeem the points across more than 2 lakh touchpoints.
While the feature will help brands and companies retain their customers and drive brand loyalty, this will also help them with a competitive advantage against their peers.
Meanwhile, customers will also be rewarded for their behavioral attributes like registering for a newsletter, or liking a post of the brand, for referring another customer, for creating content, for custom actions, for running a mile, for investing a particular amount, for maintaining certain balance in account, for
credit
card usage limit, for purchasing from a brand, for special occasions.
Founded in the year 2011 by Verma, an XLRI alumnus, Thriwe has headquarters in India and offices across the UAE, Singapore, London, and Florida. It has raised funding from the angel fund YourNest fund and Africa’s Ison Networks.
The company runs India’s largest tech-enabled benefits as a platform ecosystem and has over one lakh partner associations and service delivery presence in 130 countries globally. They have services including concierge, travel ecosystem earn and burn across, dining, hyperlocal, gyms, e-commerce and golf among others.

Ikea eyes omnichannel expansion and local sourcing in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ikea-eyes-omnichannel-expansion-and-local-sourcing-in-india/articleshow/103325630.cms,03-09-2023,"Swedish furniture giant
Ikea
is embarking on a multifaceted expansion strategy in India as it enters its second phase of growth in the country. The company's plans include diverse
retail
formats, online operations in Delhi-NCR by the end of 2024, and increased local sourcing to make its products more affordable for Indian consumers.
Susanne Pulverer, CEO of Ikea India, emphasized the company's commitment to long-term growth in the Indian market. She stated, ""Our next growth phase in India looks very promising and full of opportunities. IKEA is committed to India and here for the long term. We are looking at an omnichannel expansion in India with diverse retail formats to come closer to the many people in India.""
In this new phase, Ikea plans to accelerate its expansion, building on the insights gained from its first five years of operations in India. The company has already invested Rs 10,500 crores to establish five stores in India and has announced investments in two large shopping centers in Gurugram and Noida, both featuring integrated Ikea stores.
Delhi NCR
is identified as Ikea's next significant market, with online operations set to commence by the end of 2024, followed by the opening of the Ingka Centres Gurugram project in 2025. After Delhi, Ikea is considering expansion into other cities such as Pune and Chennai.
Pulverer stressed the importance of establishing a strong omnichannel presence in each market, combining flagship stores with different format services fulfillment setups. She noted that full-size Ikea stores have performed well in India, serving as the foundation for their retail strategy.

Regarding investments, Pulverer hinted at a long-term commitment to India, saying, ""We are only in the beginning of reaching people in India. So we will have to invest much more. We are here for the long term.""
Additionally, Ikea aims to increase its local sourcing share in India, making its products more affordable for Indian consumers. The company is also exploring the possibility of manufacturing wooden products in India.
Reflecting on Ikea's five years of operation in India and its 40-year history of sourcing from the country, Pulverer highlighted the importance of managing supply chains effectively, especially during the pandemic. She emphasized Ikea's desire to be a part of India's growth story and a responsible business partner.
For the financial year ending on March 31, 2022, Ikea India reported a 77.07% increase in net sales/revenue, reaching Rs 1,076.1 crore. These developments signify Ikea's commitment to expanding its footprint and enhancing its local presence in India, one of its key growth markets.

Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail in talks to raise $2.5 bn by end Sept,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/mukesh-ambanis-reliance-retail-in-talks-to-raise-2-5-bn-by-end-sept/articleshow/103281343.cms,01-09-2023,"Indian billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
's
Reliance Retail
Ventures is in advanced talks with global investors to raise around $2.5 billion by the end of September, ahead of a potential stock market listing, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Three sources said the target fund raise of $2.5 billion is part of a combined $3.5 billion target the firm has set for itself, a part of which - $1 billion - came from Qatar Investment Authority (
QIA
) and was announced last month.
In an emailed statement,
Reliance
said ""As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours."", but added ""Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis.""
Reliance last month said it raised $1 billion from QIA at a $100 billion valuation for
India
's biggest retailer whose operations stretch from selling groceries to electronics, and include foreign partnerships with brands like Burberry and Pret A Manger.
Morgan Stanley is advising Reliance on the process, said two sources with direct knowledge. Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment.
Live Events
All the three sources declined to name potential investors. But the first source said Reliance was talking to at least two U.S.-based investors, while the other two sources said there was growing interest from existing foreign investors of Reliance, including some sovereign wealth funds.
The investment, if it materializes, will bolster India's status as a rare bright spot for Western private investors who are shying away from new investments in China due to the country's worsening economic outlook and geopolitical tensions.
In 2020, Reliance
Retail
raised $5.71 billion by selling a 10.09% stake to investors including KKR, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, General Atlantic and the United Arab Emirates' Mubadala.
Ambani said this week its 2020 fund raise valued the business at around $52 billion, and ""in less than three years, the valuation of retail has almost doubled.""
A fourth source with direct knowledge said two Reliance fund raise announcements were likely within two weeks, and valuation of the company would be around the same at which QIA invested -around $100 billion. That implies a potential $2.5 billion investment will be equivalent to a 2.5% stake in the company.
""Several marquee global strategic and financial investors have shown strong interest in Reliance Retail. I will update you about our progress with them in due course,"" Ambani said on Monday during the company's annual general meeting, without sharing further details.
Ambani said in 2019 that the group planned to list the retail business in five years.
Ambani's daughter Isha Ambani leads the retail expansion. Reliance Retail has more than 18,000 retail outlets, but also a growing e-commerce operation where it competes with the likes of Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart.
Reliance Retail reported a consolidated net profit of 91.81 billion Indian rupees ($1.11 billion) for the financial year that ended in March 2023, on revenue of 2.6 trillion rupees.
Since last year, Reliance Retail has been expanding its consumer business by acquiring dozens of small grocery and non-food brands as it targets building a consumer business generating annual sales of $6 billion within five years to challenge foreign giants like Unilever.

Vote on Space Mantra's Future Retail bid likely soon,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/vote-on-space-mantras-future-retail-bid-likely-soon/articleshow/103258052.cms,01-09-2023,"Lenders to the debt-laden
Future Retail
have put to vote the sole takeover plan from
Space Mantra
, promoted by former
NBCC
chairman Anoop Kumar Mittal, although they are not too comfortable with the poor offer for what was once a leader in India's retail market.
On Thursday, the committee of creditors (CoC) extended the timeline for voting to September 7 from August 31 as some lenders wanted more time to get internal approvals from their top management. Lenders are closely weighing their options with some preferring liquidation of the company rather than assigning the debt for next to nothing.
""The offer is very close to the liquidation value and some lenders are uncomfortable with selling it so cheap but our choices are limited. One school of thought is that this is the only bid on the table and if we go for liquidation it will delay the process further and also add to the CIRP costs because it will take six to nine months more,” said a person familiar with the process. “But some others are of the view that selling it so cheap and that too based on payments to be received later could invoke questions. Everyone is weighing their choices.""
Space Mantra's offer of Rs 553 crore is 2.79% of the total outstanding dues of Rs 19,773 crore of financial creditors. The company has submitted a bank guarantee of 20% of its bid value (Rs 110 crore) which can be encashed if it fails to fulfill its resolution plan.
It has promised to start paying back lenders after 90 days post the
NCLT
approval for its plans.

Space Mantra was the only bidder seeking to take over the whole of Future Retail, among 48 expressions of interest received by the resolution professional (RP), ET had reported in May. The
RP Vijaykumar Iyer
did not reply to an email seeking comment.
Kishore Biyani's flagship retail venture owes a total of 38 creditors led by bond holders represented by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) which owns 21% of the debt or Rs 4109 cr followed by
Bank of Baroda
at 1826 cr or 9.24%,
Union Bank of India
9% or 1779 crore and
Central Bank of India
8.38% or 1656 crore.
Space Mantra's offer says if the sale of assets doesn't materialise, then the company has reserved its right to give back the asset to the lenders. The low recovery rate as well as preconditions to the bid has put off some lenders.
""Besides the very poor offer, the discomfort by some lenders is because the liquidation value is unclear as many stores were not accessible for a proper valuations because either they were locked by landlords for non payment of dues. So the worry is that the liquidation value would be much higher than the current bids which is why some prefer not to sell it for a song now,"" said a second person aware of the details. ET could not ascertain the current liquidation value.
To be sure, the company's assets have been eroded as all the consumable inventory is past expiry and most of its stores have been taken over by
Reliance Retail
after their lease ran out.
The company had 302 stores, its brand value, some furniture and fixtures, non-perishable inventory, and investments in subsidiaries, which can be valued, ET had reported in May.
Lenders are also uncomfortable because of the history of the account. ""So much has happened. This account first slipped in 2019. A Covid induced restructuring was introduced in 2021 which failed and subsequently,
Reliance
Retail made an offer to take over the company which was challenged by Amazon. Then Reliance also took over stores, so banks would rather be safe than sorry,"" said a third person aware of the matter.
Future Retail's valuations have also evaporated after Reliance took over the lease of its top stores. Lenders say any decision to give the asset at a low price could also backfire in an election year.
""It is an evolving situation. Banks will weigh all options. With the history of this case banks will be cautious before finalising anything,"" said the second person cited above.
Then there is also the question of a likely fraud unearthed in the company which is being investigated by different consultancy firms.
Earlier in August the RP moved the NCLT against the erstwhile directors of Future Retail alleging Rs 14,809 crore of transactions, which could be in the nature of fraudulent, extortionate and preferential in nature.
Lenders admit that chances of recovery from the retailer look bleak as the company has no running stores and its brand value has been eroded due to the long bankruptcy process.

"ONDC provides huge growth opportunities for financial services, manufacturing, e-commerce, agri sectors: Deloitte",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ondc-provides-huge-growth-opportunities-for-financial-services-manufacturing-e-commerce-agri-sectors-deloitte/articleshow/103238220.cms,31-08-2023,"The government's initiative
ONDC
is providing a huge platform for growth of four key sectors, including financial services, agriculture, manufacturing, and e-commerce retail, a
Deloitte
report said on Thursday. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is an initiative of the commerce and industry ministry to create a facilitative model to help small retailers take advantage of digital commerce.
It is not an application, platform, intermediary or software but a set of specifications designed to foster open, unbundled, and interoperable open networks. The network aims at helping MSME players in the retail sectors to take advantage of the fast growing e-commerce space in the country.
The report said that the ONDC presents an opportunity for financial institutions to engage with MSMEs segment that is mainly dependent on government schemes and non-baking financial companies (NBFCs) for credit as they are not deemed creditworthy by mainstream financial institutions.
The size of lending does not make it profitable for financial institutions to lend to this sector, and the lack of data related to MSMEs has meant that credit approvals, based on traditional decisioning models in most instances, get rejected.
""The ONDC ecosystem is expected to digitise the data available on SMEs (using the transaction data) with the help of financial technology services providers... The digitised data will enable financial institutions to develop better understanding of this client segment to tailor products and services,"" the report/whitepaper titled 'commerce@Bharat: Redefining business models and supply chain', said.

It added that the increased adoption of ONDC in smaller cities and rural areas will open newer segments for banks and also drive tailored products and services catering to this segment's needs.
""The MSME segments have been traditionally dominated by regional players. ONDC opens up opportunities for digital-savvy financial institutions to cater to the segment,"" it said.
A recent report by the
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) committee on MSMEs stated that the sector has an estimated credit gap of Rs 20-25 lakh crore.
About the manufacturing sector, the report said that the manufacturing environment has become more challenging during and after the Covid pandemic with geopolitical tensions leading to changes in the trade landscape, supply chain disruptions, and component shortages and volatile commodity prices.
""ONDC is likely to enable the manufacturing community to tap some of these opportunities and address challenges across the value chain,"" it said, adding, with the availability of a large pool of logistics service providers on ONDC, organisations can optimise overall logistics cost and manage demand increase more effectively.
The network will help manage supply chain disruptions in the manufacturing sector as on ONDC, the original equipment makers can quickly identify alternative supply sources at competitive prices from an extensive pool of suppliers and order the component to ensure zero disruption in manufacturing operations.
It also said that with the increasing importance of online sales, the retail ecosystem (brands, retailers, distributors, suppliers) can use the network to connect within their ecosystem and with end consumers.
Over the past few months, categories such as grocery, food delivery, home and decor, electronics, fashion and lifestyle, beauty and personal care, and pharmaceuticals have been leveraging the ONDC network with support of multiple stakeholders.
""ONDC creates an opportunity for brands/retailers/MSMEs to efficiently and cost effectively address their demand and supplier connect. There are exciting possibilities in both B2B and B2C commerce,"" it said, adding brands and retailers can use this network by onboarding their physical outlets and distribution points/warehousing.
It added that the network can support brands to connect directly with their retailers and/or enable their distributors to expand their reach and coverage.
They can also provide features and services such as 24x7 ordering, next-day delivery, auto ordering, and credit management to their sales partners, the report said.
It added that the ONDC can also offer brands/retailers to expand their supplier base and reduce cost of procuring raw materials or manufacturing products.
Further, about the agriculture sector, it said ONDC will provide an opportunity to accelerate technology adoption in agriculture throughout the country as it can integrate both buyers and sellers across the farm value chain onto a single network.
""The network might come as a boon for agritech start-ups that face a challenge of discoverability. FPOs will get access to input, technology, equipment, and services from companies and government bodies,"" it said.
Commenting on the report, Sathish Gopalaiah, President, Consulting, Deloitte South Asia, said that ONDC is a remarkable opportunity for India's economy spanning diverse industries.
""With a unique proposition built around agility, security and profitability at the same time, ONDC streamlines value chains, bridges gaps, and endorses innovation, paving the way for the next generation to explore novel paths,"" he added.

India turning into magnet for foreign luxury brands,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/india-turning-into-magnet-for-foreign-luxury-brands/articleshow/103225218.cms,31-08-2023,"More than a dozen luxury consumer goods brands are entering the country ahead of the festive season, as they look to attract consumers in a market riding on the growing affluence of Indians with higher incomes, spurring greater discretionary spending even in small towns. The trend is being driven by increased exposure to global trends, younger people buying luxury products, and a post-pandemic boom, all of which are stoking interest from western
luxury brands
, executives said.
The surge of new and upcoming launches includes Swiss luxury chocolate maker Laderach, which set up its first boutique at upscale mall DLF Emporio in New Delhi last week. French luxury retailer Galeries Lafayette is entering
India
in partnership with the Aditya Birla Group. Spanish luxury fashion house
Balenciaga SA
is planning stores with
Reliance Brands
. Swiss luxury multi-brand watch and jewellery boutique TimeVallee and Dutch haircare salon services brand Keune among others are also set to make their debut. As the Chinese economic engine falters, luxury brands are betting that steadier growth in India will lead to greater demand for their products.
“There is absolutely no question about the potential of the Indian market with upscale and luxurious brand experiences. We are very confident of the Indian market, the big cities and consumers here,” said
Elias Laderach
, executive board member and chief creative officer of Laderach, the largest chocolate retailer in Switzerland.
The family-owned luxury chocolate maker, which has entered India in partnership with DS Group, plans to set up five-seven stores in India over two years besides selling through their own ecommerce platform.
Experts said a K-shaped recovery is fuelling the influx of global luxury brands. While the entry-level product categories has been hit by inflation and other factors, luxury products appear to be booming.
Live Events
“The luxury market is inflation proof — consumers in this segment don’t get impacted by inflationary trends,” said Santosh Desai, social commentator and columnist. “Even regular basic needs categories are seeing packs which are priced four-five times higher. These packs have no relationship with the base segment. Such products obviously cater to a small market but this set of consumers is rising relentlessly and these consumers have a desire to spend across all categories. This is being referred to as a K-shaped recovery.”
Aditya Birla Fashion Retail
(ABFRL), which has partnered with French luxury retailer Galeries Lafayette for setting up stores in India to sell over 200 luxury brands such as Armani,
Christian Dior
and
Prada
, called the partnership “a coming-of-age moment for Indian luxury”.
ABFRL managing director Ashish Dikshit said, “India is now home to a generation of young and affluent consumers with global exposure. This is visible in the boom and dynamism of the luxury market. The partnership with Galeries Lafayette is an endorsement of India as a future engine of growth for luxury brands.”
Reliance Brands, which has ambitious plans in the luxury segment, is rapidly scaling up its existing partnerships with global brands Valentino and Tiffany in the run-up to the festive season, executives aware of the plans said.
“Global brands are now tailoring their offers and marketing campaigns to India,” said Anurag Mathur, partner Bain & Co. “Louis Vuitton launched a Rani Pink line, Dior held a fall show in Mumbai and Bvlgari introduced the mangalsutra. Additionally, the entry of new global brands like Valentino, Balenciaga and Galeries Lafayette… and several other Swiss and Italian brands are in conversation to enter India.”
A Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report said that the number of millionaires in India was estimated to double from 796,000 in 2021 to 1.6 million in 2026.
Dutch luxury hair cosmetics company Keune entered India last week in a distribution and marketing partnership with Indian beauty company Maison D' Auraine.
“India is a vibrant market,” said chief executive Eelco Keune. “We see tremendous growth. After the pandemic, more and more people want to spend money on grooming.”
The brand will be focused on 25,000-plus premium salons across India, he said.
Mathur of Bain cited the expansion of Michael Kors to seven stores, adding that AJIO Luxe, Tata CliQ and Collective have broadened their offerings with brands such as Self Portrait and Cult Gaia. New categories such as home decor are emerging with the opening of stores like Elle Decor and Pottery Barn in India, he said.
Tata CLiQ Luxury, which partnered with Swiss luxury multi-brand watch and jewellery store TimeVallee in March this year to launch its digital boutique in India, is scaling up to sell timepieces made by Cartier, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Panerai, Piaget and Roger Dubuis.
While labels that don’t have a presence are making a beeline for India, those already in the country are scaling up their footprint. Italian luxury fashion label Gucci recently named actor Alia Bhatt as its first Indian global ambassador.

CoutLoot to onboard five million sellers from Tier 1 towns in the next two years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/coutloot-to-onboard-five-million-sellers-from-tier-1-towns-in-the-next-two-years/articleshow/103163912.cms,29-08-2023,"CoutLoot
, India’s largest online non-grocery retail aggregator, said it plans to onboard five million sellers from
Tier 1
towns in the next two years.
The company said its focus on smaller cities is largely due to the opportunity size and the reality of the challenges that small city sellers face versus big cities.
""
E-commerce
adoption, small minimum order quantity purchases, access to credit are some of the early trends that are common across retailers. Coutloot’s strategy for the next year is to consolidate and increase our penetration of supply, demand and services offered to a particular retailer while capturing a mass share in the non grocery retail market,""
Jasmeet Thind
, Cofounder of CoutLoot said.
India has seen digital distribution precede physical distribution across multiple industries and sectors and that creates an inherent value proposition for Indian startups that are solving for real customer pain-points and are disrupting the middle men.
The company has recently entered offline retailing where it transforms and standardizes existing small retail shops selling unbranded merchandise which are already part of CoutLoot’s platform The existing small retailers currently generate between Rs70,000 to 5 lakh per month in sales.

""Their current average sales would be around Rs 12 lakh per year and there would be around 25% uplift in sales,"" added Thind.
In India, branded retail segment is still 10-15% of the overall market, while the rest is highly unorganised, a space which Coutloot wants to tap into. At present, retailers face two key challenges - generating demand and managing supply chains. Also, smaller stores still source 90% of their requirements from the open market which includes intermediaries
Founded by Thind and
Mahima Kaul
, CoutLoot has more than 16 million users and over 32 lakh sellers and stores in its network with an annual gross merchandise value of $100 million. The company has so far received funding of $17 million from investors including Ameba Capital, 9Unicorns, NB Ventures and Artha India Ventures among others.

"Retail business to be fastest growing segment for RIL, says Mukesh Ambani",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-business-to-be-fastest-growing-segment-for-ril-says-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/103147766.cms,29-08-2023,"The
retail business
will be the fastest growing segment for Reliance Industries in the days to come, chairman
Mukesh Ambani
said on Monday. Reliance has invested $10 billion for the expansion of the retail business in the past two years.
Addressing shareholders in the company's 46th annual general meeting held virtually, Ambani said as ""India grows from a $2,500 per-capita economy to a $10,000 per-capita economy,
Reliance Retail
will be our fastest-growing business in revenues and Ebitda."" Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, or the operating profit.
Based on the latest investment by sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority in Reliance Retail, the valuation of the business has touched ₹8.28 lakh crore. This is in contrast to the last round of fundraising in September 2020 when the valuation was ₹4.28 lakh crore, he said.
""In less than three years, the valuation of retail (business) has almost doubled, notwithstanding the intervening Covid-19 pandemic. Based on this valuation, Reliance Retail, had it been listed, would have ranked among the top four companies in India and top ten retailers globally. The pace of this value creation is unmatched globally,"" said Ambani.
Reliance Retail director
Isha Ambani
told shareholders that the company has invested over $10 billion in the past two years ""focusing on building integration, growing in-house brands and improving supply chain networks"".
Live Events
She said the company opened more than 3,300 new stores last fiscal year, taking the total count to over 18,000 stores and that two-thirds of them were in tier-II, -III cities and smaller towns. The digital and new commerce sales contributed nearly ₹50,000 crore last fiscal, accounting for about a fifth of the retail revenue, she said.
The business also crossed the milestone of 100 crore transactions and received more than 78 crore footfalls in FY23.
""We are delivering value to over 30% of India's addressable population. All this has made Reliance Retail rank among the top ten most visited retailers in the world,"" she said, adding that Reliance Retail currently serves over 98% of India's pin codes through integrated online and offline channels.
Formats like Trends, Hamleys and Urban Ladder are now live on the cross-category horizontal platform, JioMart, which is seeing a sustained uptick in non-grocery category contribution, she said.
""The launch of JioMart on WhatsApp has been a phenomenal success. There has been 9X growth of JioMart customers on WhatsApp since its launch in 2022,"" she said.
Reliance Retail posted annual revenue of ₹2,60,364 crore in FY23, registering year-on-year growth of 30%. It reported a net profit of ₹9,181 crore and Ebitda of ₹17,928 crore for the year.

"Ikea Hyderabad store, its first outlet in India, to breakeven soon, says CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ikea-hyderabad-store-its-first-outlet-in-india-to-breakeven-soon-says-ceo/articleshow/103145250.cms,28-08-2023,"Swedish furniture maker
Ikea
expects its Hyderabad store, the first in the country to achieve operational breakeven soon, the company said on Monday without providing the revenue details. Hyderabad store which was opened in 2018 has witnessed a footfall of three million during the last 12 months period against 2.90 million a year before. However, the figures are not comparable as last year and period before that witnessed a lot of movement restrictions due to
COVID-19 pandemic
.
Speaking to media,
Ikea India
CEO
Susanne Pulverer
said the firm is exploring different formats of stores in terms of size, to penetrate the market and get closer to people where they live. It would also be complemented by online services. ""I mean when we invest, the first years of investment of this size, it's not profitable and that is common when we foray into new markets. So, of course Hyderabad is the store we are looking and working on to get to break even soon,"" Pulverer said.
She hinted that the store can become profitable by next year. However, she did not affirm it. The official further said the firm has made a commitment to invest Rs 10,500 crore in the Indian market and that amount will be exhausted once the two formats in Delhi (Noida and Gurugram) are completed. Ikea currently has three big format stores operational in Hyderabad, Navi Mumbai, and Bengaluru and two city stores in Mumbai.
When we look at projects in Delhi-Noida and Gurugram we can see that we have booked all these Rs 10,500 crore. They are not fully spent, but with these projects that are in the pipeline it will be, we have invested all of it. So, the next phase is of course looking at new investments that we are currently working on,"" she explained. Meanwhile, the home furnishings retailer on Monday said it is celebrating five years of retail operations in India.
A press release from Ikea said the company employs 3,000 coworkers today in all its markets and the aim is to reach 10,000 in the coming years with 50 per cent gender diversity. In its stores, the company employs close to 70 per cent of coworkers from the local neighbourhood. Local sourcing is a priority to become even more affordable with ambition to reach 50 per cent in the coming years, it added.

ONDC is an initiative of the Ministry of Commerce & Industry to help small retailers expand their business and reduce the dominance of e-commerce giants. It aims to build an open, interoperable network on which buyers and sellers can transact without needing to be present on the same platform.
It offers small retailers an opportunity to provide their services, and goods to buyers across the country through an e-commerce system, where buyers will be able to purchase the products, which are sold on any platform.

Isha Ambani

“We are scaling it (Campa) up further in India, and have also started work to take it global, starting with Asia and Africa,” Ambani, director at
Reliance Retail Ventures
, said in her address at the AGM.
In April, Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) arm of Reliance Retail Ventures, had inked a strategic partnership with beverage can and filling company Ceylon Beverages, promoted by former cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan, to co-pack and manufacture Campa soft drinks, and this partnership is expected to be leveraged for Campa’s foray in markets outside India as well, executives aware of the plans said.

Reliance Retail had acquired Campa mid last year from Pure Drinks group for an estimated Rs 22 crore. A legacy brand started by the Indian company Pure Drinks in the 1970s, Campa Cola became a popular aerated drink with its tagline ‘The Great Indian Taste’. The brand lost out after Coca-Cola and PepsiCo entered India, riding on the country’s liberalisation programme.
“Campa is also exploring exclusive partnerships and alliances with other retail channels, besides setting up its own manufacturing plants which may also service markets outside of India,” said one of the executives, who did not wish to be identified.
Reliance, which started to scale up Campa in retail channels earlier this year, is taking the brand national now. However, the domestic soft drinks category was severely impacted in the crucial April-June quarter this year as unseasonal rains impacted business in the core summer months, which contribute more than half the annual soft drinks sales.
On Reliance Retails’s overall FMCG plans, Ambani said, “This (FMCG) business made a strong start by entering several categories through multiple brands and strategic partnerships. A key pillar of our FMCG business is to make heritage Indian brands contemporary for today’s Indian consumers, keeping the age-old brand promise intact.”
The daily packaged goods categories Reliance has entered over the past year include soft drinks with Campa, Sosyo and Raskik, chocolates with Lotus, western snacks with General Mills, confectionery with Toffeeman, biscuits under Maliban, and home and personal care brands Glimmer and Dozo. It is pushing prices at entry-level packs to compete with established FMCG makers such as Coca-Cola, Britannia, Mondelez and Hindustan Unilever.
The company expanded its grocery brand Independence to northern India in June, to sell staples, processed foods, soaps and detergents, and household hygiene products. It said the brand, launched late last year in Gujarat, would provide locally developed products at affordable prices.
Analysts said the company’s entry into mass categories such as soft drinks, chocolates and soaps would lead to price wars, but that dislodging long-established brands would be a challenge. “RIL has huge financial muscle but FMCG players know how to deal with new entrants,” Nuvama Equities wrote in a report.

Retailers' body asks Delhi govt to reconsider total shutdown for G20 summit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-body-asks-delhi-govt-to-reconsider-total-shutdown-for-g20-summit/articleshow/103142138.cms,28-08-2023,"Retailers Association of
India
on Monday asked the
Delhi
government to reconsider the total shutdown for
retail stores
, malls, and restaurants from September 8-10 in view of the
G20 Summit
. The move would deprive international visitors of experiencing India's unique
shopping and culinary scenes
, Retailers Association of India (RAI) said in a statement voicing concerns about the proposed blanket suspension of operations for
retail
stores, malls, and restaurants during the G20 Summit.
""Retail is integral to Delhi's cultural identity. Entirely shutting down retail and food and beverage establishments during the G20 Summit would deprive international visitors of experiencing India's unique shopping and culinary scenes,"" RAI CEO Kumar Rajagopalan said.
He asked the Delhi government to allow ""at least partial retail operations to promote the 'Sell in India' initiative in tandem with Make in India"".
The retail industry body said a three-day total closure would significantly impact the retail sector economically, potentially jeopardising the livelihoods of numerous employees and their families.
Also, it said, ""Delhi boasts a rich culinary heritage. Closing markets would deprive visitors of the opportunity to savour authentic Indian dishes, an important part of our cultural presentation.""

View: Consumers building the e-commerce odyssey,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/view-consumers-building-the-e-commerce-odyssey/articleshow/103126518.cms,28-08-2023,"In the ever-evolving landscape of business, India's ecommerce industry has emerged as a beacon of both growth and transformation over the last three years. It maintains its robust y-o-y growth, with noticeable transformation in consumer behaviour as markets progress to the post-pandemic world.
A recent report by
Redseer
Consulting estimated that India’s ecommerce market is expected to reach $163 billion by 2026 and online sales will account for over 25% of the sales across major
retail
categories barring grocery, by 2026. This phenomenal growth is propelled by several catalysts, most notably the expanding middle class, accessibility to high-speed internet across Tier 2 and Tier 3+ regions and brands adopting technology to offer seamless shopping experience to consumers.
Retail brands across sizes are striding through the ecommerce wave and powering their businesses with technological platforms to cater to the rising consumer demand and with a positive outlook towards India’s economy. According to Unicommerce's '
India eCommerce Index 2023
', Indian ecommerce witnessed a 26% y-o-y growth in order volumes and 23.5% GMV growth in FY2023.
The rapid emergence of D2C brands, and the rising adoption of omnichannel retail channels underscore the bright prospects that lie ahead for the
e-commerce
sector. Both these trends present a great opportunity, especially for SMEs to enter and grow into the ecommerce sector and serve the evolving consumption habits and burgeoning consumer appetite for
online shopping
.
In recent years, multiple D2C brands have showcased that large retail brands can be built through new-age digital channels and that it doesn’t necessarily require a conventional retail approach to build brands in the contemporary retail environment. These D2C brands have also been able to foster a deeper connection with customers. It illustrates a shifting consumer mindset, where consumers are comfortable with online transactions and value the shopping experiences along with great products.

Consumers are shopping and engaging with brands through both online and offline shopping channels. Brands are working towards integrating all their sales channels to offer a unified experience to consumers. Over the next few years, we will see many AI and ML led innovations to enhance the consumer shopping experience for online and in-store shopping. These advancements will not only uplift online experiences but also reshape in-store shopping dynamics, ushering in a new era of consumer engagement.
As Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities continue to embrace ecommerce, there is immense scope for growth. The country is also poised to witness an influx of retailers from smaller cities joining the bandwagon. This democratisation of market access will redefine the retail landscape and create large, and possibly pan-India, markets for sellers so far focused on smaller regions.
For a sector as big and crucial as retail, technology’s best role is that of an enabler -- supporting India’s existing and new retail participants to embed technology to drive greater efficiencies and reach. In this regard efforts like ONDC will play a crucial role.
These elements, among others, are shaping the path for the future of ecommerce. Its growth is not just influencing the economy, but also altering the way people shop. Over the next few years, we're set to see an even more remarkable expansion in India's ecommerce market as a greater number of Indians embrace online shopping.

Prices for tomatoes have rocketed, at one point close to five times since June, while those for onions, another staple in Indian cooking, have risen 80% in some areas like New Delhi. Food inflation for July hit a staggering 11.5%, far more than 4.6% in June and marking a three-year high.
As purse strings tighten, the pain felt by India's clothing and shoe retail sector - worth an estimated $62 billion in 2022 according to

Interviews with managers at 25 other fashion outlets across four Indian cities who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity painted a similar downbeat picture.
Popular Indian and foreign brands including shoe retailers Japan's Asics and
Skechers USA
have been offering steep discounts, some as much as 70%, far bigger than normal and have also been extending their sale periods, said several store managers.
Even when customers do purchase fashion items, they buy far fewer than they once would have, some of the managers also said.
Zink London, Asics and Skechers did not respond to Reuters requests for comments.
The downturn in fashion spending has also been accompanied by a slide in spending at restaurant chains like Domino's.
That said, Indian consumer spending is not uniformly down in the dumps. The country's biggest cinema operator
PVR Inox
recently clocked its highest daily box office revenue of $5 million, driven by some hit Bollywood offerings.
Wealthier people also continue to spend with premium SUV sales at a record high.
But worries are mounting about the threat that inflation and high interest rates pose to consumer spending.
""The biggest threat to India's growth will come from private consumption, which constitutes about 60% of GDP, which is weak already,""
Deutsche Bank
economist Kaushik Das wrote in a report this month.
The bank has forecast India's economy to log slower growth of 6% this fiscal year compared to 7.2% last year.
In some encouraging signs,
tomato prices
have eased off peaks and India's central bank chief last week said vegetable prices, which have begun to soften, will decline from September.
Retail outlets and industry executives are also hoping that the upcoming festival season - including Diwali in November when people like to make big purchases for gift-giving and for themselves - will bring some sales relief. But others are not necessarily optimistic.
""The expectation is always there that people spend during festive season ... But we will have to wait and see what people spend on since the inflation factor has also come in,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at
Bank of Baroda
.
For now, consumers say they need to be more frugal given the increase in grocery bills.
""We are looking for branded clothes to fit our budget and are visiting showrooms where there are maximum discounts,"" said Anjali Mohanty, a housewife in the eastern city of Bhubaneswar who was shopping for jeans for her son.
""We have to adjust our family expenditure.""

Mall sales perk up amid rise in footfalls in movie theatres,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/mall-sales-perk-up-amid-rise-in-footfalls-in-movie-theatres/articleshow/103110618.cms,27-08-2023,"The success of movies
Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani
,
Gadar 2
and
OMG 2
has lifted sales in malls in August with retailers reporting a 10-15% increase in footfalls and sales in comparison with last month.
""Around six-seven releases have actually worked well for cinema's occupancy and people have come back to the screen. There is an increase of footfall by a good 10-11% and that helped F&B and apparel. Typically, people come in to have food and also shop before or after the
movie
,"" said Pushpa Bector, senior executive director at DLF Retail that operates premium malls in the Delhi-National Capital Region.
Other movies that have brought back people to cinemas include
Barbie
and
Oppenheimer
.
After Pathaan in January, box-office collections have been tepid although the release of the Kerala Story in May and Mission Impossible 7 in July managed to revive revenue of malls to an extent.
An ET reporter visited three premium malls in the NCR and about two dozen retailers across different categories said they witnessed a similar jump.
Live Events
""We have seen some changes week to week, especially last week when we saw movie releases. Even the Independence Day weekend was a strong weekend and there was good, healthy growth,"" said Shailesh Chaturvedi, managing director and CEO of
Arvind Fashions
that sells brands like US Polo Assn, Arrow, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Flying Machine and Sephora in India.
According to the Retailers Association of India, sales in July 2023 showed growth of 9% compared with a year earlier. The growth rate has slowed from March onwards.
""There has been at least 10% growth in the footfalls due to the people coming back to theatres and a part of that crowd has contributed to the growth of F&B and shopping as well. Average time spent by a person in the mall has gone up considerably,"" said Jayakumar Gangadharan, regional director, Lulu Mall, Lucknow.
Brands such as
Shoppers Stop
, Max, United Colors of Benetton, Marks and Spencer, H&M and Bodyshop in Select City Walk and DLF Mall of India, Noida, reported growth in sales due to cinema.
""Cinemas are the largest crowd puller for a mall. While only serious shoppers come when there is no good movie running, the footfall from a theatre is a bonus for retailers. People who come to a movie often spend extra time to shop, that's why for a mall to do well, cinema is very important,"" said Harsh V Bansal, cofounder of the Unity group that operates over half a dozen malls in Delhi and Punjab.
Apparel and footwear had reported slower growth in sales in comparison with other categories during July 2023. In categories, QSR and Food & Grocery reported growth of 15% and 14%, respectively, followed by jewellery (12%) and sports goods (11%) as compared to sales levels in July 2022.
""Footfall has increased during OMG 2 and Gadar 2, while during Barbie and Oppenheimer, it was constant. It also coincided with the sale season and Independence Day, which helped us,"" said a sales executive of an apparel brand.

“Seeking associations with ISRO and Chandrayaan have become universal in appeal for the last three days; it’s gone beyond its niche appeal for space enthusiasts and students,” said Gaurav Marya, founder and chairman of retail, licensing and franchising consultancy Franchise India, which is also a licensed merchandise partner of
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) in India.
ITC has launched a limited-edition dessert, Lunar Dulce de Leche Choux Bun, under the ITC
Sunfeast
Baked Creations brand name in celebration of Chandrayaan-3. The dessert resembles the moon along with a chocolate replica of the Chandrayaan-3 rover. The company also undertook moment marketing campaigns on social media using brands like Aashirvaad, Bingo!, Sunfeast, Farmlite,
Sunfeast Bounce
and Classmate.
Many of these brands are seeking strategic partnerships and collaborations across space-related products.
“We are getting queries in large numbers for licensing partnerships with ISRO. Chandrayaan-3 has been the game changer, across all space-related merchandise categories,” Marya said. He added that categories which have approached his company for licence partnerships include makers of lifestyle and fashion, stationery, games and backpacks.
“We’re over the moon as the #FantasyOfEveryHeart has finally transformed into a splendid reality,” ITC posted on Instagram on behalf of its Sunfeast cookies brand. “Over the moon.. the feeling of happiness when your investments bear good returns,” HDFC Bank said in campaigns released on social media. Domino’s Pizza linked the event to a successful delivery status, while cab hailing service Uber ran a pun which said: “Location par aa gaya hun (I’ve reached the location)”.
Space-related branded merchandise sales run into billions of dollars globally. A part of this market remains unorganised, though.

The ongoing Household Consumer Expenditure Survey (HCES) includes questions on online purchases of products, but it does not seek details about the proportion of products purchased online and offline or other granular data.
The ministry now wants to determine the prices of online services as well, the person added.
The Indian online grocery market was worth $6.8 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $37 billion by 2028, registering a compounded annual growth rate of 31.3%, according to estimates from market research group IMARC.
Experts believe such an exercise is much needed given consumption trends have undergone significant changes post-Covid.
Online purchases have picked up substantially after the lockdown. People are doing it out of necessity, a lot of these things have become a habit,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist,
Bank of Baroda
.
Sabnavis suggested that the ministry could later use the data to construct an online price index.
""It would be good to know what proportion of people were using online services and whether inflation for online users was lower or higher than others, like is done for rural and urban categories,"" Sabnavis added.
MoSPI has significantly increased its sampling frame for the exercise for more robust results. It has been preparing for the base revision of the Consumer Price Index, which last took place in 2012.
The Household Consumption Expenditure survey, which started last year, is near completion, and the ministry will start the second round of surveys, which will be completed next year in July 2024.
The government had decided to conduct two back-to-back surveys to ensure consistency. The earlier survey conducted in 2017-18 was junked by the government citing to data inconsistencies. The results of the HCES may be made available after the completion of the second survey next year.

Reliance Annual General Meeting: What to expect in retail business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-annual-general-meeting-what-to-expect-in-retail-business/articleshow/103057662.cms,27-08-2023,"India’s multinational conglomerate,
Reliance Industries
Limited (RIL) with its stronghold in almost every sector is set to hold its Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 28 with a major focus on its financial services but announcements and a future roadmap for its retail arm could also be expected.
“Expecting disclosures around the retail business to improve over the coming quarters,” said JPMorgan Chase, a leading global financial services firm.
""The Street will want to know further plans for the retail business, which now forms the largest part of RIL’s valuation apart from announcements related to Jio Financial,"" reported ET.
Recently, even before the AGM,
Reliance Retail
made a big announcement that Qatar Investment Authority will pick up a nearly 1 per cent stake in the retail arm, valuing the country’s largest retail firm at $100 billion. The valuation of the retail business of Ambani has doubled within three years, and this has increased the noise of a possible initial public offer (IPO) of Reliance Retail on the Street, said ET.
At present, the retail business contributes approximately 12 per cent to Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) of its entire business arena which includes oil, gas, chemicals, telecom, retail and several other ventures, revealed Reliance Industries' annual report for the year 2022-23.

Since its last meeting, Reliance Retail has increased its EBITDA, which is a measure of company profitability used by investors, from Rs 12,423 crore in 2021-22 to Rs 17,974 crore in 2022 to 2023.
Over Rs 2 lakh crore revenue has been generated by Reliance Retail in 2022-2023 as compared to nearly Rs 1 lakh crore in 2021-22.
Reliance Retail further established itself as a market leader as it has been featured in the top 100 retailers globally.
The company’s retail sector has already crossed the 1 billion transactions mark, according to the annual report.
Upcoming AGM Expectations:
Despite hitting milestones in its retail business, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani could use this AGM to soothe the worries of its shareholders by providing a roadmap for its retail business.
“A bigger concern is the retail business as they are unsure of the endgame for Reliance Retail, even as the conglomerate has been steadily growing the business across categories,” said JP Morgan.
The firm further expects that the retail segment could turn out to be one of the most important sectors from investors' point of view as there are chances of a ""much better operating environment for RIL over the coming years.""
Key Announcements of Previous AGM
In the last AGM, Isha Ambani was announced as the director of its retail business.
In her address to the shareholders, she announced the company’s decision to foray into the FMCG business where it will face fierce competition from old giants like
ITC
and
Hindustan Unilever
.
However, despite competition, the company has been valued at more than $100 billion, making it bigger than FMCG giants like ITC and HUL, as calculated by global brokerage firm JPMorgan.
The global firm pegs Reliance Retail’s enterprise value at $112 billion and implied equity value at $102 billion.
While, on the other hand, multinational investment bank UBS has valued it at $110 billion, Bernstein at $111 billion while domestic brokerage
JM Financial
estimates it at $105 billion, reported ET.
“The objective of this business is to develop and deliver high quality, affordable products which solve every Indian's daily needs,” said Isha Ambani on the launch of the FMCG business of Reliance Retail.
Since its last AGM, Reliance Retail on June 22 of this year has stepped up its fight to increase its footprint in the FMCG space by focusing on producing ""made-for-India"" consumer packaged goods brand ‘Independence’ for North India.
Reliance Consumer Products, a subsidiary of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL), announced the expansion of the brand this year that sells FMCG products ranging from staples to processed foods and other daily essentials in the densely-populated Punjab, Haryana, Delhi NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Bihar.
Reliance Retail's FMCG arm first launched the brand in December last year in Gujarat.
Along with its announcement to enter the FMCG business, the director also commented on its latest collaboration of Jio Mart with Whatapp.
‘The launch of JioMart on WhatsApp is a truly novel initiative which combines online shopping experience with the simplicity of instant chat services,” said Reliance’s annual report for 2022-23.
The retail business expanded its store network with over 3,300 new stores added during the financial year, taking the store tally to 18,040 stores Pan-India which stood at nearly 15,000 stores during its last AGM, highlighted the annual report of the company.
The report further said footfalls at its stores increased by 50 per cent from last year to 780 million. The registered customer base also grew to 249 million. Between 2022-23, Reliance Retail entered into the beauty segment by launching Tira, a digital platform, along with opening its flagship store in Mumbai.
“The business also expanded its product basket through acquisitions and partnerships at both local and global levels like Metro, Campa Cola, GAP, Pret A Manger, Lotus, Sosyo, Maliban, Toffeeman to name a few,” said RIL’s annual report.
Through digital brands like Ajio and Netmeds, the company is using digital commerce to scale up at a rapid pace and is contributing to the strong growth of the retail segment.
“Growth in new commerce business has been fast-paced with rapid expansion of its merchant partner network. Currently, more than 3 million merchants have partnered with our new commerce platforms,” said the report.
""The sustained growth across consumption baskets has further consolidated our position as a market leader. We continue to innovate and invest in our stores and digital platforms to make shopping more engaging for our customers,"" said Reliance Retail Ventures Executive Director Isha Ambani.

RIL may sell 8-10% more in Rel Retail ventures to fund expansion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ril-may-sell-8-10-more-in-rel-retail-ventures-to-fund-expansion/articleshow/103038228.cms,25-08-2023,"Reliance Industries
is likely to sell another 8-10% stake in
Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd
(
RRVL
) to fund expansion, retire debt and prepare for the initial public offering of the conglomerate's retail business, two senior industry executives aware of the plans said.
This process will likely happen in tranches over 12-15 months and will be critical for the proposed
IPO
by the holding company of Reliance's retail operations, the executives said.
The stake sale is crucial because at the current valuation of $100 billion (₹8.25 lakh crore), RRVL's IPO size will be humongous and the market may not have the liquidity to absorb such an offer. Hence, the company thinks, another 7-10% equity dilution will make the IPO size manageable to ensure its success since by then its valuation is also likely to go up, the people said.
As per India's listing rules, the public shareholding, including those held by financial investors, of a company must be at least 25%. At present, around 11% in RRVL is owned by global investors, including
Qatar Investment Authority
(QIA) that on Wednesday invested ₹8,278 crore ($997 million) for a 0.99% stake.
Reliance
Industries owns less than 89% and some shares are held by small investors.

'$10 billion investment'
At the current valuation, if RRVL were to go for an IPO, it would need to dilute around 14% shares worth about ₹1.15 lakh crore, an IPO size too big to be successful, one of the executives said. Hence, Reliance Industries will have to sell more equity in RRVL to either existing or new investors before the IPO, he said.
""If RRVL is able to sell around 20% (including the current public holding) to investors, it can then offer around 5% to the public in the IPO. That would make the IPO size almost $5 billion or ₹41,000 crore at the current valuation. And with valuation growing by the time the IPO comes, RRVL has to continue selling shares to investors or the IPO will not be successful,"" the executive said.
Queries emailed to Reliance Industries remained unanswered at the time of going to press Thursday.
RRVL is expected to use proceeds from pre-IPO stake sales to fund store expansion and retire debt, the people said.
Morgan Stanley
in a report published on Thursday said over the past two years, Reliance Industries had ""invested $10 billion in the retail venture with a focus on increasing upstream and downstream integration along with growing its brand portfolio"".
The second executive said of the $10 billion (around ₹82,000 crore) invested, the company had raised ₹47,000 crore from investors in 2020 and the balance was largely debt. ""The current spate of equity dilution will help to reduce the debt to prepare the balance sheet for the IPO,"" he said.
CLSA in a report on Thursday said capex in Reliance's retail business rose to $6 billion in FY23 and the investment from QIA will help fund future capex and keep debt in retail under control.
RRVL's valuation has nearly doubled since 2020, when Reliance had sold a 10.09% stake in the company to nine global investors for ₹47,265 crore. RRVL's valuation then was ₹4.21 lakh crore.
Reliance Industries chairman
Mukesh Ambani
had said in the company's 2019 annual general meeting that the retail business would be listed within the next five years.
LIC's IPO last year was the largest in India, which had an issue size of ₹20,557 crore.
RRVL, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, operates an integrated omni-channel network of more than 18,500 stores and digital commerce platforms across the grocery, consumer electronics, fashion and lifestyle, and pharma segments and has partnered with over three million merchants through its new commerce initiative. Reliance Retail, a subsidiary of RRVL, is the only Indian company among the global top 100 retailers and is the largest in India by sales and profit. It is almost 3.5 times the value of the largest listed retail chain, Avenue Supermarts, which owns
DMart
, and 2.5 times the combined scale of the next three Indian retailers.

Small firms eye homegrown apps to build strong footprint beyond metros,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/small-firms-eye-homegrown-apps-to-build-strong-footprint-beyond-metros/articleshow/103034632.cms,25-08-2023,"Several small businesses that are world famous in their neck of the woods, like a wafer company in Ahmedabad, a hosiery outfit in Kolkata or a footwear company in Chennai are striking out for greater glory and sales through homegrown apps that provide in a hyper-local audience and a strong footprint beyond the metro cities to push their products
""We've observed heightened interest from local and regional businesses seeking impactful yet budget-conscious advertising,"" Sunil Kumar Mohapatra, Chief Revenue Officer,
VerSe Innovation

VerSe Innovation, which runs DailyHunt and Josh, said it had a substantial volume of advertisers from the local and regional business segment. These companies typically spend between ₹ 30,000 to ₹50,000 per month on advertising, with some spending even more. The company said it has established partnerships with several local brands like Chandigarh Ayurved Centre, Nimbus Academy, portable cabin manufacturer Sagar Cabin, among numerous others.

Industry watchers said the short form video boom that
India
has been witnessing is what is fueling this growth. Gaurav
Jain
, head of emerging business at
ShareChat
and Moj, believes that it is what will drive the next set of users who come online in India. He said that it will not only grow in terms of users and engagement time but also in how advertisers can use the medium to reach out to their prospective customers.
""We have been reaching out to these small and medium businesses for the last six months extensively and the response has been extremely positive,"" Jain said. ""We are very bullish about the enterprises in tier II India and there's no reason why they would not want to reach out to customers in other cities through digital platforms. Large tech players are expensive and don't have a designated point of contact, so they come to players like us.""
He said that the requests range from doing a 10-second video sponsored ad, a hashtag challenge on Moj or a branded share on WhatsApp. ET reported on July 30 that ShareChat was looking to monetize the very real tendency of wanting to share a piece of content with friends and family on WhatsApp. With their new feature - 'Branded Shares' advertisers can target customers through WhatsApp every time a user shares their favourite content from ShareChat to contacts on WhatsApp the company's ad pre-rolls before the actual video plays.
""The skew of advertiser revenue is still more towards large businesses but the sheer growth we are seeing in small and medium sized businesses is very high. The low base effect and our drive to onboard more businesses of these sizes are contributing to this growth,"" he explained.
In Q1 of 2023, ShareChat's ad revenue grew by 20% year-on-year in Q2, this figure was about 35% and in Q3, Jain said the company was looking at year-on-year growth north of 60%. He added that there has been an 80% decrease in their expenses the last 12 months and that if things continue this way, ShareChat is confident of turning contribution margin positive by the end of the year.
Mohapatra of VerSe Innovation observed an impressive growth trend in this segment and that the combined effect of higher client numbers and increased average order values indicates ""a potentially significant upward trend in ad revenue from these companies in the near future.""
Hipi is yet another short video app that has many local businesses using its platform by collaborating with local content creators who are well known in their towns or cities and make them sport a certain outfit or an accessory and the respective shoppable links for the users to shop from their website, right from the video.
""The shopping from the short video space is entertainment first,"" GBS Bindra, chief business officer at Hipi explained. ""Users are not using it as a typical e-commerce platform where they're opening the app with the intention of purchasing something but rather are scrolling through the videos, getting entertained, spending time and in the process just might find something they love from the creator whose video they were enjoying and decide that they would like to purchase it, in a very serendipitous way.""
Like Jain, Bindra too said that large businesses constitute more in terms of ad revenue, but he feels that as time passes, this will begin to reverse. ""It is still early days for short video. Any ad-driven platform must first be embraced by larger companies and only then does it percolate to smaller companies. Short video platforms will be no different. We will see more small and medium size companies opening up to the prospect of advertising on platforms like Hipi, once they see success of well known brands on it.""
It isn't just social media apps that are banking on local businesses but also platforms like Knocksense, which provides users with hyperlocal privileges and entertainment in cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Indore, Goa, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad. Vibhore Mayank, founder of the content commerce platform said over 90% of its ad revenue comes from local businesses. ""Most of our advertisers see merit in being able to create content surrounding their brand as an effective way to market,"" he explained.
Venus Dhuria, co-founder at AppyHigh, said while this is certainly a trend that is taking off and that there are several companies that are experimenting with this format, he said the results are yet to be seen. The RoI has still not been assessed. ""We are seeing a lot of interest amongst homegrown apps to tap this segment, but large businesses are where they get most of their revenue from,"" he said.

Reliance Retail launches youth focused brand Yousta,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-launches-youth-focused-brand-yousta/articleshow/103032738.cms,24-08-2023,"In January, ET had reported
Reliance Retail

Landmark group
owned Max and Shoppers Stop’s new mass priced brand InTune.
All products in Yousta are priced below Rs 999, with a majority priced below Rs 499.
“The team will continuously work with India’s younger generation to understand their evolving fashion needs,” said Akhilesh Prasad, President and CEO – Fashion and Lifestyle, Reliance Retail.
Experts said India's consumption structure has been skewed in the past over a narrow base of richer consumers accounting for a large chunk of the overall market.
However, as the economy is broadening across many more cities and the impact is reaching further down the income ladder, the opportunity for value-formats and value-brands is expanding.

"Real growth in beauty coming from tier-2, 3 markets: Masaba Gupta",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/real-growth-in-beauty-coming-from-tier-2-3-markets-masaba-gupta/articleshow/102995303.cms,23-08-2023,"LoveChild
, the beauty label founded by entrepreneur-designer
Masaba Gupta
and owned by
Aditya Birla Group
under the House of Masaba franchise, is looking at tier 2 and 3 markets as its core growth driver as it scales up amid a surge in the number of beauty brands competing for share. ""If we ignore tier 2 and 3 markets, we’ll be making a big mistake. The real numbers are coming from these markets, and from younger consumers here,” Gupta said on Wednesday, while announcing scale-up plans for the
House of Masaba brand
, in which Aditya Birla group has 51 per cent stake.
India with its largest population of young people and increasing disposable incomes is seeing surge in demand in beauty and fashion categories, led by large retail, aspirational small city consumers, deeper e-commerce reach and social influencers.
Gupta, founder of LoveChild, said the brand’s packaging and branding targets younger, aspirational consumers across metros and smaller markets. The brand franchise includes fragrance line Meetha, Surya Namaskar sunscreen and lip range by the name of Masala Chai.
“There’s immense room to grow. The Indian beauty market is not as evolved as it is globally, and so far, only few colours sell,” she said.
Gupta said after one year of being online, LoveChild is setting up an offline presence to meet a surge in demand in physical retail, starting with tie-ups with retailers like SS beauty and Tira. So far, the brand has followed a largely digital and direct to consumer (D2C) retail approach, and its own House of Masaba stores.

A report by researcher Euromonitor said higher incomes, Internet access and the young population are leading to a beauty boom in India that is projected to reach $17.4 billion by 2025 from $15.6 billion in 2022. Besides larger traditional labels like Lakme. Maybelline, ColorBar, Lotus Herbals and Revlon, there's an influx of digital focused and global brands competing for share.

At the time of acquisition, ABFRL said the acquisition would help boost the group’s presence in fashion and beauty aimed at young consumers.

Ventures Ltd
, the retail business of Mukesh Ambani’s
Reliance Industries Ltd
, is looking to raise Rs3,048 crore through an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) of its warehousing and logistics infrastructure assets, shows a draft document filed with Sebi.
ET first reported on 12 April that Reliance was planning to monetise the warehousing and logistics assets of its retail business through an InvIT and that the group had set up a trust under the name of Intelligent Supply Chain Infrastructure Trust for this purpose.
Reliance Retail will hold a minimum of 25% units of the trust and balance will be sold to incoming investors.
Of the total issue proceeds of Rs3,048 crore, around Rs100 crore will be used for acquiring equity shares of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) created to hold the warehousing assets, while a sum of Rs2,928 crore will be used to provide a loan to the
SPV
for acquisition of the warehousing and related logistics assets.
The initial proposal is to acquire warehouse space of 12.77 million square feet and related logistics infrastructure for a consideration of Rs4,261 crore.

The portfolio of assets will comprise 64 warehouses spread across 34 cities across India including key warehousing markets such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Pune and Hyderabad. Each of these 64 warehouses has an area of more than 100,000 square foot and an investment of more than Rs25 crore.
Reliance will soon start reaching out to investors for the proposed InvIT fundraise, a source aware of the company’s plans told ET.
Reliance Retail
reported a consolidated revenue of Rs2,31,366 crore and net profit of Rs9,181 crore for the year ended March 31, 2023.
As of June 30, 2023, Reliance Retail operated 18,446 stores with 70.6 million square feet of retail space across the country.
Reliance Retail's business is spread across grocery, consumer electronics, pharmacy, fashion and lifestyle, with brands such as
Reliance Fresh
, Reliance Digital, Trends and Ajio.com. It has also announced multiple new forays, such as FMCG, and entry into new verticals like beauty.
This is the fourth InvIT from
Reliance Industries
following its infrastructure trusts in gas pipelines, Jio telecom towers and fibre optic cable network.
In 2019, Reliance had monetised its gas pipeline network, East West Pipeline, in a Rs 13,000-crore sale to
India Infrastructure Trust
, an InvIT sponsored by Canadian investor Brookfield. The group also raised Rs 25,215 crore, via its telecom tower InvIT, from Brookfield and other investors in 2019.
In 2020,
RIL
raised Rs 7,558 crore from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund for a 51% stake in Digital Fibre Infrastructure Trust, which was set up to monetise its fibre optic network assets.
Investment banks ICICI Securities and Axis Capital are advising Reliance Retail on the InvIT fundraising.

Future Group companies moves to Delhi HC against a debt recovery tribunal order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/future-group-companies-moves-to-delhi-hc-against-a-debt-recovery-tribunal-order/articleshow/102955146.cms,22-08-2023,"The
Future Group
companies on Tuesday moved the Delhi High Court against a debt recovery tribunal's July 31 order that restrained them from alienating their assets in recovery proceedings initiated by lenders.
A bench led by Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma, while seeking response from the government, Future Group founder Kishore Biyani,
Rattan India Finance
,
RBL Bank
,
Yes Bank
and others refused to stay the
DRT
order. The matter will be next heard on October 18.
Challenging the validity of various provisions of the Recovery of Debt and Bankruptcy Act 1993,
Future Corporate Resources and Future Brands
said the provisions do not provide an opportunity of being heard before adverse orders are passed by the tribunal in respect of the assets and properties of debt-laden firms.
The provisions allow the tribunal to mechanically pass orders restraining the borrowers from dealing with or disposing of their assets and properties without applying mind to certain conditions like whether such orders are required to secure the amounts claimed by the lenders and whether the value of such assets is proportionate to the claim amount.
These provisions are ultra vires the Act as they operate to obstruct/delay the recovery of loans by banks and other financial institutions and also “confer drastic and extraordinary powers” upon the tribunal to pass interim exparte order without prima facie satisfying that the conditions required for such restraint orders are met, the petition filed through counsel Pallavi Pratap stated.

Such “wide-sweeping orders” of the tribunal have the effect of incapacitating the borrower from discharging the debt by liquidating its unsecured assets, thereby obstructing the recovery of debt and thus act contrary to the very purpose of the Act, the petitions stated.

CAIT
said on Tuesday.Confederation of All India Traders Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said that the ""same set of 5-6 companies"" are top sellers on prominent e-commerce platforms which leaves no scope for small businesses to grow.
""There has to be a regulatory authority...like

Speaking at a Meesho event for MSMEs, he also said that the government is likely to roll out a robust
e-commerce policy
against unethical business practices and foreign direct investment (
FDI
) violations by the end of the month.
The proposed national e-commerce policy of 2019 by the commerce and industry ministry is said to be in the final stages, with the e-commerce policy aiming to prepare strategies for inclusive and harmonious growth of the e-commerce sector through a streamlined regulatory framework for ease of doing business, adoption of modern technologies, integration of supply chains and enhancing exports through the medium.
""It is in the domain of the government to announce this, but I believe that by the end of the month, we will be having a robust ecommerce policy and rules,"" he said.

One-third of FNP’s annual business revenue is generated during Rakshabandhan. Starting from 2020, FNP have had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20-25%. They are anticipating 25-30% surge in order volume compared to the last year.
Rakhi production over the years has increased, alongside rising online demand.
Data from the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) shows the sales of 3500-crore Rakhi in 2018, which rose to 4000-crore in 2019.
The figure stood stagnant over the next year due to the pandemic. The sales rose to 6000-crore in 2021 and to 7000-crore in 2022.
“We expect the Rakhi business to touch more than 10 thousand-crore in 2023, with a 7% constant supply to the online market,” said National Secretary of CAIT, Praveen Khandelwal.
Deloitte, in its recently released report ‘
Future of Retail

When one compares the products of the companies, ""it is prima facie apparent, in my considered opinion, that the defendant (Dabur) has consciously imitated nearly every essential and distinctive feature of the plaintiff's (Emami) product, apparently to capitalise on the goodwill and reputation earned by the plaintiff's product over a period of time,"" Justice Shankar had said, while noting that the slight difference in shape was so imperceptible as not to be recognised by an average customer.

Future Lifestyle Fashions
(FLFL) under the
corporate insolvency
process has run into a roadblock due to a conflict of interest between promoter
Kishore Biyani
and the
forensic auditor
appointed by lenders, people aware of the development said. Dilip Dixit had undertaken an assignment for one of the Biyani-promoted company before FLFL was admitted for corporate insolvency. Dixit is also partner of GD Apte & Co, the firm which the lenders appointed as forensic auditor of FLFL in July 2022.
This has resulted in a conflict of interest, according to a petition filed by Biyani. A division bench of the Bombay HC on August 11 ruled that neither Dixit nor GD Apte & Co should undertake the forensic auditor's role for FLFL. Lenders are now preparing to appoint another forensic auditor to expedite the sale of the company under corporate insolvency. ""Thus, it is a setback since a year is lost waiting for the report,"" a senior bank official said.
""Although the RP can proceed with the
sale process
, the extent of recovery will be known after a forensic report is tabled before lenders for review,"" the banker said. Forensic audit helps lenders gauge if promoter has undertaken any preferential or fraudulent transactions that can be clawed back. Lenders plan to seek an explanation from GD Apte & Co as to why it did not disclose the assignment undertaken by a Future Group company. ""Lenders may consider not giving new assignments to firms that do not disclose conflict of interest,"" said the lender cited above.
GD Apte & Co in response to ET query claimed they have ""suo-moto declined the assignment as forensic auditors of FLFL"" and denied any conflict of interest. ""Thus, there arises no question of withholding any such data from the lenders.""

Earlier the ministry had issued two draft
national e-commerce
policies.
The 2019 draft proposed to address six broad areas of the e-commerce ecosystem - data, infrastructure development, e-commerce marketplaces, regulatory issues, stimulating domestic digital economy and export promotion through e-commerce.
The draft had talked about a framework for restrictions on cross-border data flow; collection or processing of sensitive data locally and storing it abroad; measures to contain sale of counterfeit products, prohibited items and pirated content; and review of the current practice of not imposing custom duties on electronic transmissions in the light of the changing digital economy.
Besides, it had suggested provisions for promoting exports through e-commerce; and developing capacity for data storage in India.
The proposed policy would take into account the interests of all stakeholders, like investors, manufacturers, MSMEs, traders, retailers, startups and consumers.
The government is also in the process of framing consumer protection rules for the sector.
Broadly the intention is to make the policy work along with the consumer protection rules and not in conflict with each other.
The e-commerce policy aims to prepare strategies for providing a conducive environment for inclusive and harmonious growth of the e-commerce sector through a streamlined regulatory framework for ease of doing business, adoption of modern technologies, integration of supply chains and enhancing exports through this medium.
Domestic traders body CAIT has time and again demanded to roll out of the policy as they had alleged that foreign online retailers violate norms of the FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in commerce and the government should take action against those who are indulging in malpractices.
The government permits FDI in the marketplace model of e-commerce and it is not allowed in the inventory-based model.
The onus of compliance with the provisions is on the invested company and any violation of FDI regulations is covered by the penal provisions of the FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act).
While the RBI administers the Act, the Enforcement Directorate is the authority for the implementation of FEMA and takes up investigations in cases of contravention of the law.
Further, the regulatory framework for the digital/e-commerce sector is still evolving in the country. The sector is governed by the
Information Technology Act
, Consumer Protection Act, FDI policy on the e-commerce sector, and Competition Act.
The DPIIT is also working on a national retail trade policy.
Domestic traders have also sought a regulatory authority be set up to monitor and regulate e-commerce trade in the country.

Under IBC, avoidance transactions are transactions undertaken by the corporate debtor prior to the initiation of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) to defraud its creditors or to benefit related parties as well as its own management.
RP has moved an application under section Section 66(1) of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
The provision says if, during CIRP or a liquidation process, it is found that any business of the corporate debtor has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the corporate debtor or for any fraudulent purpose, NCLT may on the application of RP pass an order to any persons to make such contributions to the assets of the corporate debtor as it may deem fit.
RP of Future Retail Ltd has also approached NCLT, seeking a third extension till September 15 to complete CIRP.
CIRP was initiated against FRL by NCLT on July 20, 2022, following a loan default.
As per Section 12(1) of the Code, CIRP shall be completed within a period of 180 days from the date of initiation.
However, NCLT may grant a one-time extension of 90 days. The maximum time within which CIRP must be completed, including any extension or litigation period, is 330 days.
Earlier, FRL had said it had received six bids from prospective buyers by May 15, which was the last date for submission of resolution plans.
The deadline for submission of resolution plans was May 15, 2023, for 48 companies, which were in the final list of 'Eligible Prospective Resolution Applicants'.

Uniqlo all set to scale up India production,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/uniqlo-all-set-to-scale-up-india-production/articleshow/102789142.cms,17-08-2023,"Uniqlo
, Asia’s biggest clothing firm, said it’s on track to make more than 30% of the products it sells in
India
within the country as it expands beyond northern markets.
The Japanese brand, which is opening its first store in
Mumbai
next month, said made-in-India products already account for more than 30%, taking into account exports for global supplies.
“The target obviously is not just 30% but the idea is to take 100%. But we have to increase Indian business first,” said Tomohiko
Sei
, CEO,
Uniqlo India
. “Mumbai sales are already very high through online and opening stores will help expand business further.”
For single brand retail, 100% foreign direct investment (
FDI
) is allowed but if the foreign investment exceeds 51%, then sourcing 30% of the value of goods procured is mandatory from India.
However, the government amended the rule two years ago by allowing foreign retailers to fulfil their local sourcing requirements by procuring goods produced in units based in special economic zones.

Uniqlo opened its first door in the country in September 2019, but stringent lockdown measures announced in March 2020 to contain the Covid-19 outbreak delayed its store expansion plans, restricting its store count to about ten outlets so far.
The company’s first Mumbai store will be in
Phoenix Marketcity
, Kurla, and spread across 11,500 sq ft, while the second, 7,500 sq ft store, will be in Oberoi mall in Goregaon East.
Over the past decade, global brands
Zara
and H&M have become market leaders in the fast fashion segment in India. Rivals, including Levi's, Gap and H&M, have been expanding their store network aggressively.
“Indians like affordable pricing but high quality clothing. We want to be in India for 100 years and don’t have a short-term vision in store numbers and sales targets,” said Sei. “We are not just chasing fashion. Store target number is not our purpose and product quality is the main focus.”
In 2021-22, Uniqlo India’s sales increased 63% year-on-year to Rs 391.7 crore, slower than in the previous year, when it clocked 86% sales growth on a lower base. However, the company said India remains among its top performers globally in terms of growth and is not seeing any slowdown.

Luggage industry insulated from slump: Samsonite India head,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/luggage-industry-insulated-from-slump-samsonite-india-head/articleshow/102780752.cms,17-08-2023,"Samsonite
, the world’s biggest luggage maker, said the Indian travel industry has been insulated by the overall slowdown in discretionary spends helped by consumers vacationing quarterly instead of just once or twice a year post pandemic.
“People have decided that travel is an important part of their lives post Covid. Luggage is not one of the most exciting categories like automobiles or even mobile phones. But it's top of mind and an important category before you travel,” said
Jai Krishnan
, CEO, India at Samsonite South Asia. ""Since Indians are making quarterly trips now, even shorter ones, there are now more occasions to buy. Our industry has been insulated despite slowdown all around.""
The maker of
Tumi
and
American Tourister
said India has grown 38% during the first half of 2023 despite a strong base and its highest growth ever at 56% when it outpaced China last calendar year to become the second largest market globally. In 2022, India posted sales of $218 million compared to China, which had revenues of $166.5 million.
In the past few years, the
luggage industry
has grown steadily led by changing lifestyles, growing middle class and availability of low-cost airfares, although growth was completely halted during the first year of the pandemic. And Indians are traveling beyond top tourist destinations and cities to even smaller towns, helping surge hotel occupancy rates.
""We are witnessing a remarkable shift in travel trends among Indians in the post-pandemic era. As the world redefines its travel preferences, we are pleased to see a surge in curiosity and exploration beyond the confines of top cities and tourist hotspots. Our presence in Tier 2 cities and lesser-known destinations has enabled us to cater to the burgeoning demand for authentic and immersive travel experiences,” said Raoof Razak Dhanani, managing director,
Sayaji Hotels Ltd

Samsonite recently invested nearly Rs160 crore to expand its hard luggage manufacturing capacity from 500,000 pieces a month to 750,000 pieces and setting up an automated warehousing in Nashik, Maharashtra.
""Even during the pandemic, we invested in the supply chain, from manufacturing and warehousing to retail stores and advertising. So if you do all these things right and people know that you are the world's biggest luggage maker, then things have to work,"" said Krishnan, adding organised players have benefited and within the segment, premium players like Samsonite are doing even better.
In India, Samsonite straddles across price-points with the eponymous brand in the premium segment, American Tourister in the value segment and Kamiliant at the mass-priced level. American Tourister is the country’s biggest luggage brand and accounts for more than half of Samsonite’s India revenues. The company also expanded its store count especially for American Tourister that had 200 doors pre-pandemic but will reach 500 by Diwali this year.
A recent report by Crisil said India’s luggage industry revenue is set to rise 5% on-year this fiscal despite a high-base effect of 40% growth last fiscal due to rising penetration of hard luggage made by the organised sector, and continuing growth in tourism and corporate travel.
The luggage business in India is estimated at less than Rs 50,000 crore, with organised players accounting for about a quarter of the industry.
VIP Industries
, Samsonite and
Safari Industries
control nearly 90% of the branded segment.

On March 23, 2023, creditors of FRL invited new EoIs whereby prospective buyers can bid for the debt-ridden firm ""as a going concern or individual cluster or a combination of clusters of its assets"", as it failed to attract a resolution plan in more than four months.
FRL operated multiple retail formats in both the hypermarket supermarket and home segments under brands such as Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Foodhall. At its peak, FRL was operating more than 1,500 outlets in nearly 430 cities.
It was part of the 19 Future group companies operating in the retail, wholesale, logistic and warehousing segments, which were supposed to be transferred to
Reliance
Retail as part of a Rs 24,713-crore deal announced in August 2020.
However, lenders had rejected the takeover of the 19 Future group companies, including FRL, by Reliance amid a legal challenge by Amazon.

Uniqlo announces second store in Mumbai; plans to enter southern market,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/uniqlo-announces-second-store-in-mumbai-plans-to-enter-southern-market/articleshow/102778185.cms,16-08-2023,"Japanese apparel retailer
Uniqlo
now plans to enter the southern market to open its stores as part of the next phase of offline expansion in India.
Uniqlo India
on Wednesday announced to launch its second store in Mumbai as part of the strategic expansion of its retail network in the country.
The retailer, which forayed into the Indian market in October 2019, has a substantial presence in North Indian cities like Delhi-NCR, where it operates 7 stores. It is also present in Lucknow and Chandigarh.
The company is also on track to achieve 30 per cent domestic sourcing, as per the current FDI policy, with the help of a local supplier.
It now works in India with 17 sewing factories and 6 fabric mills, Uniqlo India CEO Tomohiko Sei said.
Live Events
Uniqlo had announced to enter Mumbai earlier this year.
Its first store in Mumbai at Phoenix Marketcity, Kurla, will open on October 6, and the second store at Oberoi Mall, Goregaon East is scheduled to be launched on October 20, he said.
Besides, the company, which is expanding in the country in a phased manner, is very positive for Southern Markets from where it gets a good demand on its e-commerce website.
When asked about entering in Southern markets, Tomohiko Sei told PTI: ""Yes, the southern market is an important market and is on our radar. We also see a very positive and good demand from this region through our e-commerce website"".
However, at the moment, the aim now is to establish our presence in Mumbai to provide quality services to our customers here, he added.
As part of its strategy, Uniqlo is focussing on the northern markets, and after establishing itself in the region, it will move to the western part, which will take its total store count to 12 by the end of 2023.
When asked about expansion plans, Sei said: ""Right now, we are focused on two stores in Mumbai, but of course, we are looking for the opportunity for better cities, maybe like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai. There are so many Metro cities in India"".
Besides, Uniqlo India is also scaling its online presence, which currently contributes around 15 per cent of its total sales. With the expansion of its brick-and-mortar stores, it expects to maintain the current ratio, going forward, Sei said.
""We set and achieved our target of 15 per cent when launched our e-commerce platform in 2021. With the expansion of our brick-and-mortar stores, we still aim to maintain the online store portion at the same level. This, of course, differs from month-on-month basis seasonality and store opening,"" he added.
Besides, Uniqlo is on track to achieve 30 per cent domestic sourcing from India as mandated by the government under the FDI policy for single-brand retailing.
""We are actively growing local suppliers to deliver quality products for our customers. For example, now there are a total of 17 sewing factories and 6 fabric mills we work within India.
""From 2023 Spring/Summer, we are pleased to see some Indian factories started to contribute to the production of our innovative product, with our strategic partner, TORAY Industries,"" he said.
Under the current norms, 100 per cent FDI is permitted in the single-brand retail trade with a rider of 30 per cent mandatory local sourcing to promote micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs).
Uniqlo is a brand of
Fast Retailing
, a leading Japanese retail holding company with global headquarters in Tokyo, Japan.
It is the largest of eight brands in the Fast Retailing Group, which clocked global sales of approximately USD 16.6 billion in the 2022 fiscal, ending August 31, 2022.
UNIQLO has more than 2,400 stores, including in Japan, Asia, Europe and North America.

"Titan Eye+ to focus on calibrated growth, puts expansion plans on hold till fourth quarter",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/titan-eye-to-focus-on-calibrated-growth-puts-expansion-plans-on-hold-till-fourth-quarter/articleshow/102739347.cms,15-08-2023,"Eyewear retailer Titan Eye+ is shifting its focus from growth to strengthening the existing stores for the next few quarters. At the launch of its new line
Zefr
, CEO
Saumen Bhaumik
told ET that the eyewear arm of the Bengaluru-headquartered
Titan Industries
, is likely to focus on growth after the fourth quarter this fiscal.
“We have opened 300 independent outlets in the last two years, and we’ve crossed Rs 1000 crore turnover as a consumer priced top line…it is time for us to sort of get our energy back in making every single outlet count in terms of performance,” he said. The eyewear division, which had planned to get to at least 1000 stores by the end of 2022 has 920 stores across the country and one in Dubai. Two more stores are in the pipeline for the Gulf country and will likely be opened by the end of December this year.
Titan Eye+ is looking to increase its investment in boosting sales through its online platforms, especially Fastrack.in, added Bhaumik. Right now, online contributes to 3-4% of the company’s total sales.
Fastrack, the company’s youth focused segment, entered the prescription eyewear space a year ago. Right now, there are seven stores across three cities. Bhaumik said that by the end of the year, the segment would have 20 stores. “We’re still in the phase 1 stage…hopefully by fiscal 2025, we will press the button on scaling up,” he added.
Along with Zefr, a lightweight luxury eyewear created in France, the company also launched the second generation of smart eyewear called EyeX 2.0, and smart sunglasses from Fastrack. The first generation was launched in 2019.

Semi-casual wear making a return in languishing apparel market,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/semi-casual-wear-making-a-return-in-languishing-apparel-market/articleshow/102574856.cms,09-08-2023,"After the wave of
athleisure
during
Covid
and
formal wear
immediately thereafter taking centre stage for office wear, semi-casual or smart casual is making a return as office wear with sales of these lines growing at one of the fastest pace when the overall apparel market is languishing, retailers said.
Companies said sales of denims, chinos, polos and casual shirts are growing at a faster clip than a white, striped or solid colour shirt and formal trousers. Similarly, sneakers are growing faster than a black or brown shoe.
This is in sharp contrast to the trend from 2020 till about 2022 when first athleisure wear became the default work wear during work from home regime of Covid and thereafter people refreshed their wardrobes with formal wear as they returned back to office.
“We are seeing a significant evolution in customer behaviour where earlier office attire and casual wear used to be different. We are seeing a merging of the two where the semi-casuals, both in non-office and office wear is getting acceptable,” said Dinesh Taluja, chief financial officer at
Reliance
Retail, the country’s largest retailer.
“So, there's a trend where people are looking to buy some things which can be used both in office and outside and we are capitalizing on that trend,” Taluja told analysts after the recent quarterly earnings call.

Retailers said the broader trend of return of semi-casual – which was there pre-Covid too – is a reflection of employment generation right now and change of corporate dress codes.
Departmental store chain Lifestyle chief executive Devaranjan Iyer said maximum employment is getting generated in services, financial and IT sectors.
“In most of these industries, including start-ups, formal wear doesn’t exist unless in some functions like sales or marketing. Friday dressing has become everyday dressing after Covid. As a result, smart casual growth rates are double that of formal,” he said.
Rajesh Jain, MD & CEO at Lacoste India, said the company is innovating in solid plain polos with newer colours, plain denims and sneakers as these are the highest growth categories for the company due to wider acceptance as both workwear and leisure wear. “It’s now accepted even to wear sneakers with a suit,” he said.
Retailers said the semi-casual, smart casual range and sneakers are growing at a high double digit pace when overall apparel or footwear segments are experiencing a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures.
Departmental store chain
Shoppers Stop Ltd
reported overall sales growth of 4% in April-June quarter while its smart casual private label Fratini grew by 39%. Chief executive officer Venu Nair said the chain will roll out a new range of apparel “around modern workwear” as per the latest trend ahead of the festive season when he expects demand also to make a comeback.

About two dozen international brands are expected to enter India with their stores this year encouraged by a post-Covid consumption surge, property consultants said.
Experts said that's up from one global brand in 2020, three in 2021 and 11 in 2022. Before the pandemic, about 12-15 brands used to enter India every year.
""Evolution of Indian consumers is helping global brands to increase sale and expand the store presence. Usage of these brands continues to increase and social media has played a huge role in it. The shift is visible and share of global brands will increase further,"" said Samant Jerath of Jerath properties, a retail consultancy firm.
Italian luxury fashion brand Roberto Cavalli, British luxury goods brand Dunhill, American sportswear and footwear retailer Foot Locker are in talks to enter India. In addition, chains such as Lavazza and Armani Caffe of Italy, Jamba of the US and The Coffee Club from Australia are also likely to enter India this year.

"DMart has to add greater number of stores to grow faster, says CEO Neville Noronha",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/dmart-has-to-add-greater-number-of-stores-to-grow-faster-says-ceo-neville-noronha/articleshow/102480616.cms,07-08-2023,"MUMBAI/DELHI:
DMart
has no plans to enter wholesale retailing as of now, but we are very clear that we are a first grocery format and will work harder to add more stores to grow faster, says
Neville Noronha
, CEO of
Avenue Supermarts
which owns the DMart
retail chain
and has been lately grappling with slower growth rates.
Retailers have also been recently rushing in to open value-format stores which have impacted DMart’s apparel and general merchandise segment. Interestingly, retailers are opening shops close to DMart stores to take advantage of the huge footfalls that the discount format attracts.
In an exclusive interaction with ET, Noronha said: “We aren’t growing at 30-40% like earlier with the base effect kicking in. We need to add a significantly greater number of stores than we are adding if we need to grow faster. Our model of buying stores or having standalone stores has inherent limitations and slows us down. Shoppers come to our stores to buy groceries. While they are there they also buy other categories. Our ability to sell as much of those other categories makes the model more efficient for us and more relevant for our shoppers. That’s the endeavour,” said Noronha. Avenue Supermarts is promoted by investor Radhakishan Damani and Noronha has led the entity as CEO since 2007. As of June 2023, it has 330 stores across 14 states in India catering to the priceconscious Indian consumer.
Covid-19, commodity price surge, geo-political tensions and unusual weather have collectively made consumer demand prediction extremely complicated over the last three years, Noronha said. “Non FMCG discretionary consumption in the middle and lower income levels has been adversely impacted over the last 2-3 years. Within that the value segment of apparel has seen a larger negative impact for us. We need to now refine our assortment and make it more relevant to our format. Malls are very expensive and hence we stay away. We are trying harder to add more stores,” the executive said.
“Weak SSSG (same-store sales growth) has weighed on DMart’s stock price performance in the recent past,” brokerage firm
Motilal Oswal
wrote in its note last month.

Over the last five years, [FY19-23] the general merchandise and apparel segment revenue for DMart has underperformed its foods and nonfoods by 26% and 20%, respectively,” the brokerage said in a note.
Avenue Supermarts’ first-quarter profit rose marginally but missed estimates, even as the profit margins shrunk owing to higher costs and weak demand in the discretionary category. “Overall gross margins are lower compared to same period in the previous year, primarily due to lower sales contribution of apparel and general merchandise,” said Noronha.
“However, the general merchandise contribution is recovering and trending towards pre-pandemic levels.” The consolidated net profit of the company increased 2% over the previous year to Rs 658.8 crore in the three months to June.

Gen Z consumers bring in the moolah for many cos,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/gen-z-consumers-bring-in-the-moolah-for-many-cos/articleshow/102480577.cms,07-08-2023,"New Delhi:
Gen Z consumers
, or those between 15-26 years, are driving the fastest growth not only for categories such as
fashion
, sneakers, smartwatches and wearable devices, but also light spirits including seltzers, ale and gins, executives said.
""We have seen a demand uptick of over 105% year-on-year in the first half of the year (January-June 2023) in the
Gen Z
fashion segment,"" a spokesperson for
fashion platform
Myntra, which has over 8.6 million Gen Z
consumers
, said. ""We have witnessed over 550% increase in search keywords like ""hot pink"" and ""Barbie."" Social media and OTT platforms wield significant influence over Gen Z consumers,"" she said.
Rival Amazon Fashion launched a next-gen store this April with 200-plus fashion brands, which it said was catering to ""the first generation of Gen Z digital natives, as those born in the mid-90s and early 2000s are taking over as the powerful youth force.""
Calling
India
""a key driving force for spirits consumption"" with its young population, Mike Southgate, director, developing markets, at UK's premium spirits maker Whyte & Mackay said: ""If you look at the Gen-Z consumer in India, it is being driven by the fact that the legal drinking age in many Indian markets is lower than many bigger markets in US or China.""
There are more than 116 million Gen Z consumers in India, Market Research Society of India's (MRSI) said in a webinar in June 2023, citing data by research firm Kantar. ""This population is high on individualism, low on regrets, and more self-appreciating. They are also known to give significantly higher importance to their personal appearance, as compared to other age cohorts,"" MRSI said. Citing another industry report, MRSI said Gen Z is the first generation that has the ability ""to choose between many equally good options and this realisation leads to a great need to try out things.""

Besides, Reliance Retail which had forayed into the FMCG, relaunching the iconic beverage brand Campa and its own brand 'Independence', has plans to expand it. Its beauty business also launched the digital commerce platform 'Tira' and opened its flagship store in
Mumbai
.
""These businesses will be ramped up progressively in the coming period,"" said the annual report.
The business also expanded its product basket through acquisitions and partnerships at both local and global levels like Metro,
Campa Cola
, GAP, Pret A Manger, Lotus, Sosyo, Maliban and Toffeeman.
Reliance Retail runs an integrated network of physical stores, digital commerce and new commerce initiatives. Its digital brands like
Ajio
and Netmeds are scaling up at a ""rapid pace"" and contributing to the strong growth of the retail segment.
According to the company, growth in new commerce business has been fast-paced with rapid expansion of its merchant partner network.
""Currently, more than 3 million merchants have partnered with our new commerce platforms,"" it said.
Reliance Retail has best-in-class technology adoption for driving operational efficiencies. It is using ""Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning driven decision-making models help in improving customer experience,"" it said.
Over its strategic priorities, the retail business of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries will continue to expand its reach into the smaller tier II & III markets by adding more stores in those regions.
Besides, it will also ""scale up digital commerce and new commerce businesses by offering widest catalogue and superior value"".
It would also continue to ""build new capabilities by strategic acquisition and partnerships with international and Indian brands"", the report added.
Over the retail sector, Reliance said factors such as favourable demographics, rising income levels, a rising share of urbanisation, access to better education and aspirational lifestyle are driving consumption growth in the country.
""These trends are a force multiplier for the Indian retail sector which currently stands at over USD 800 billion and is expected to grow at 11 per cent CAGR to become a USD 2 trillion market by 2030,"" it said.
Reliance Retail envisions expanding its offerings and scale of operations to make products available to Indian consumers at affordable prices, the report added.

Tata's first ecommerce platform struggles to click as losses rise after exit from key categories,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tatas-first-ecommerce-platform-struggles-to-click-as-losses-rise-after-exit-from-key-categories/articleshow/102328376.cms,02-08-2023,"The
Tata Group
is continuing to burn money on its first
ecommerce platform
,
Tata Cliq
.
Tata UniStore
, which owns and runs Tata Cliq, posted a 16% increase in net loss at ₹874.7 crore for fiscal 2022-23, even as its turnover dropped to less than half at ₹407.7 crore compared with ₹844.6 crore the year before, as per its latest regulatory disclosures.
In its filings with the Registrar of Companies made on July 25, Tata UniStore attributed the drop in turnover to the platform's exit from certain categories of electronics, and said the loss increased as it continued to invest in scaling up business. The company last year exited electronics categories like mobile phones, televisions, refrigerators and laptops to focus on apparel and lifestyle products, even as the Tata Group's super app,
Tata Neu
, focused on electronics among other categories.
""During the year under review (2022-23), the company made a strategic choice and exited some major segments of the electronics category. The company took significant steps to further grow its ecommerce platforms, have stronger partnerships with brands, and a strong association with Tata Neu - the super app platform of the Tata Group,"" Tata UniStore said in the filings.

Tata UniStore declined to comment when asked about the results.
Mohit Yadav, founder at business intelligence firm AltInfo, said as Tata UniStore strategically exited certain electronic categories, the 52% reduction in operating income highlighted the need for proportional expense adjustments. ""A more comprehensive effort is essential to ensure sustainable and resilient operations moving forward,"" he said.
Tata UniStore said for the lifestyle and luxury businesses, the company continued to grow rapidly on a year-on-year basis, delivering robust growth in revenue and improvement in gross margins.
""During the year under review, the company launched
Tata Cliq Palette
for focused ecommerce of beauty and personal care products. The company plans to grow this ecommerce platform in future years by focusing on the niche space of personalised beauty,"" it said in the filings. The company has also rejigged its board. Pratik Pal, chief executive of

"High-end hits a high: From Scotch and soaps to SUVs and smartphones, demand for premium products is soaring",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/high-end-hits-a-high-from-scotch-and-soaps-to-suvs-and-smartphones-demand-for-premium-products-is-soaring/articleshow/102236728.cms,30-07-2023,"Indians hit a new high in 2022 — they guzzled over 75 lakh cases of
Scotch
whisky. That means sipping away 6.75 crore 1-litre bottles of top-shelf brands such as Johnnie Walker, Glenfiddich and Dewar's.
This was almost double what they consumed in 2020 — 39 lakh cases. It is not just Scotch that people are cheering. Between 2020 and 2022, Irish whiskey grew five times, Japanese whisky six-fold and American whiskey three times, with all three reaching 5 lakh cases, up from just 1.5 lakh.
Indian consumers are splashing out on premium, expensive products across categories. From Scotch and
soaps
to
smartphones
and
SUVs
, premiumisation of products is taking hold of the market after the pandemic.
Hindustan Unilever
,
India
’s biggest consumer goods company, gets a third of its sales from premium brands such as Dove and Tresemme. “The growth is coming from the premium end, which is about a third of the business now and it is growing fast,” says Rohit Jawa, MD,
HUL
.
Diageo, a global leader in alcohol beverages that has brands like Johnnie Walker under it, has nearly exited the mass segment in India. Now it gets 80% of its sales from the premium segment; five years ago that contributed less than 40%. “Indians are choosing to drink better, not more,” says Shweta Jain, chief business development officer (premium, luxury, reserve, craft), India & South Asia, Diageo. Consumer interest is driving companies to concentrate on their pricey segments.
Says Jain of Diageo: “We have reshaped our portfolio with a focus on accelerating premiumisation-led growth with new innovations such as Godawan, our artisanal single malt made in Alwar.”
Live Events
Jawa says HUL is focusing a lot on “innovations, advertising and promotional spend, market development and portfolio expansion” in the premium section. Its rival,
ITC
, is also crafting a future-ready portfolio across businesses with premiumisation as a key growth vector. B Sumant, executive director, ITC, says the company has been “fortifying the product portfolio with a focus on democratising premiumisation across segments”.
Jean-Etienne Gourgues, chairman and CEO of Chivas Brothers, which sells brands like Chivas Regal, Glenlivet and Royal Salute, sees the growth in Scotch sales as part of the premiumisation that has permeated the Indian market. “When you see the development of other luxury goods such as cars and the very fast growth of those segments, there is no reason why whisky cannot benefit from this very high-end premiumisation,” he says.
DRIVING SALES UP
If a bar of soap costing Rs 65 is a premium product in the FMCG sector, the price band changes drastically in segments such as auto, but that is hardly a deterrent for consumers seeking bigger and better cars. Or, bikes.
Maruti Suzuki
, which built its market dominance with small and affordable cars, has launched a sevenseater MPV, Invicto, costing Rs 25 lakh. The company hopes the premium gloss of the model will rub off on other
Maruti
brands.
Meanwhile,
Hero MotoCorp
has launched X440, the first premium motorcycle it has codeveloped with Harley Davidson, at a price point of Rs 2.29 lakh. “This is going to elevate the entire premiumisation strategy of Hero,” Pawan Munjal, executive chairman of Hero MotoCorp, said at the launch of X440.
It is a milestone for Hero MotoCorp, the world’s largest manufacturer of motorcycles and scooters, which is known as a massmarket player.
Adding to the buzz in the premium two-wheeler space,
Bajaj Auto
and the UK’s Triumph have brought out a 400cc motorcycle for Rs 2.3 lakh. Triumph would attract a new set of aspirational customers for Bajaj Auto, according to a report by brokerage firm Sharekhan.
The customer shapes the market. If she sees more value in a product for which she is willing to spend more, then companies are ready to make the most of it. Premiumisation is turning into a hallmark of this market as manufacturers hike prices along with the perceived value of a commodity.
A growing number of Indian car buyers are opting for bigger, featurepacked vehicles, marking a shift in what was predominantly a cost-conscious market. For most mass-market car makers, over 50% of sales is now in the price band above Rs 10 lakh. More than 50% of Hyundai’s sales and over 65% of Tata Motors’ sales come from cars priced above Rs 10 lakh (ex-showroom). For Hyundai, this segment contributed just 20% in 2018. This has led to more launches in the segment as well — nine so far in 2023.
Till May, 42% of car sales were in the Rs 7.5-12.5 lakh price segment. The sales in the higher price bands too have been growing so steadily that 67% of car sales in first five months of the year were in the Rs 7.5-25 lakh price segment, according to Jato Dynamics. Five years ago, 58% of sales were of cars priced below Rs 7.5 lakh.
“The consumer preference is shifting to SUVs/MPVs, which are more expensive. There is a clear shift to higher variants with more features, tech and connectedness,” says Shashank Srivastav, senior executive director, Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest carmaker.
However, with car prices going up due to rising commodity prices and stringent regulatory standards, sales are falling in the price-sensitive segment below Rs 10 lakh. A segment of buyers who have enough disposable income are not thrown by the rising prices, though.
Fifty percent of Maruti Suzuki’s sales still comes from its small and compact cars, but this is expected to drop over the next few years, as it looks to launch more premium models and focus on SUVs such as the Grand
Vitara
, Jimny and Brezza. “The increasing on-road prices in recent months indicate a clear trend towards higher price points,” says Srivastav.
Earlier, customers merely sought air-conditioning and power windows. Now they are looking for sunroofs, voice-recognition navigation systems, touchscreen displays, 360-degree cameras and cruise control, which bump up prices. “Customers are willing to pay a premium for advanced and hi-tech features,” says Tarun Garg, COO, Hyundai Motor India. “Features are cascading from the luxury segment into mass models, as OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are offering more per car to attract customers,” says Ravi Bhatia, president, Jato Dynamics.
BIGGER SCREEN
Bigger screens have entered the living room. In the first five months of 2023, while the overall TV category grew by 13% year-on-year, TVs that are 65-inches and bigger grew by 37%. Big screens are 12% of the overall TV market in the country — these were just 5% before Covid, according to market researcher GfK India. The 65-inch-plus television segment is the fastest growing, while the share of smaller televisions is shrinking rapidly.
The growing popularity of big televisions can be attributed to the entry of affordable brands in the market and a fall in prices. “We now sell as many premium, large-screen televisions in a month as we did in a year pre-Covid,” says Gireesan Gopi, India business head (home entertainment), LG.
Similarly, the share of expensive smartphones, costing Rs 50,000 and above, was 11% of the market in the first quarter of this year, compared with 4% a year ago, says Navkendar Singh, associate VP–Devices Research, IDC. The average selling price of smartphones has touched an all-time high of $265 (Rs 21,715), from $223 in 2022.
ROOM FOR MORE
Meanwhile, Patu Keswani is busy upgrading his Lemon Tree
Premier
hotels from 4-star to 4.5-star. The hospitality sector, which was battered by the pandemic, is embracing premiumisation. “A shift in consumption is taking place. With the earning capacity going up, the Indian middle class is getting very aspirational and doesn’t mind spending a little more,” says Keswani. “As demand grows we have also re-priced our room rates.”
Its average room rent will go up from Rs 7,000 to Rs 9,000 after the renovation. Oyo, the budget hotel startup, has forayed into the premium resorts category with the launch of its brand Palette.
ICRA
estimates premium hotel occupancy in India to reach a decadal high of 70-72% with an average room rate of $75 or over Rs 6,000 in FY2024.
Anil Chadha, divisional chief executive at ITC Hotels, says, “We are focused on redefining experiences through a wide range of luxury and premium brands.” It has added the brand Mementos to its luxury portfolio.
In a highly competitive and saturated market, premiumisation is one of the few growth strategies. Says Nilesh Gupta, director of Vijay Sales, an electronics and consumer retail chain: “Consumers are willing to upgrade, as they look for bigger and better products.”

"Tomato price shock hits Indian restaurants, cheaper puree sales boom",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tomato-price-shock-hits-indian-restaurants-cheaper-puree-sales-boom/articleshow/102136640.cms,26-07-2023,"Many
Indian restaurants
are cutting back on tomatoes in their popular dishes and consumer companies are ramping up production of cheaper purees that are flying off the shelves, after prices surged more than 500%.
Used widely in Indian cooking, prices of tomatoes have hit record highs in recent weeks as monsoon rains disrupted supplies at a time when seasonal production is typically low, forcing the government to organize mobile vans for subsidised sales.
Many
McDonald's
and Subway outlets have dropped tomatoes from their menu items, citing quality issues, but higher food prices are having a broader impact across the industry, while pushing headline inflation numbers above the central bank's medium-term target.
Consumers, already struggling with rising living costs, are desperate for cheaper options.
Milk and vegetable retailer Mother Dairy has seen a 300% jump in tomato
puree sales
in the last 15 days in New Delhi, a spokesperson said. Indian consumer giant
Dabur
said it has ramped up production of puree to meet growing demand.

Puree sales at Tata's online shopping website BigBasket surged 175% in early July, with senior executive Seshu Kumar saying customers who earlier bought an average of 1 kg fresh tomatoes per order were buying half of that.
Amazon said demand for tomato puree on its platform rose five times over the past month, while ketchup sales rose 30%.
Packs of puree typically contain around 40% tomato paste and the rest water, and cost 130 rupees/kg. Tomato prices on Wednesday in New Delhi were 199 rupees/kg, from around 30 rupees in April. Puree prices have so far not changed.
""With the prices going over 100 Indian rupees ($1.22), I tried to experiment with tomato ketchup for Indian gravies ... Not everyone in the family liked it,"" said 34-year-old Pravieen Sridhar, who runs a laundry business in Chennai.
Google Trends data shows the number of online searches for terms ""tomato puree"" and ""tomato puree 1kg price"" in recent weeks in
India
have been highest in the last five years.
Crop damage and transportation woes due to rain have also led to a rise in prices of other vegetables. Surging food prices accelerated India's annual retail inflation rate in June to 4.81%, snapping four months of easing and fuelling bets that the central bank will keep interest rates high into mid-2024.
Vegetables are a politically-sensitive commodity in India, where average per-capita income was estimated to be around $200 per month in 2022-23. Price spikes in onions - another key ingredient used in Indian cooking - contributed to the fall of more than one state government in the past.
Food sellers - big and small - are battling high tomato prices.
In a New Delhi business district, Birju, who sells a cheap bread-and-pea street food which typically comes with tomatoes, said he now uses the expensive item only as a garnish, and only when people push for it.
""Customers understand I am not using it because I haven't increased prices,"" he said, gesturing to a single piece of tomato on his cart, as he cooked on a hot afternoon.
Pradeep Shetty of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India said many outlets have stopped using fresh tomatoes in salads and are switching to more purees.
""Chefs are also trying to find ways to bring the sourness of tomatoes through other agents like tamarind.""
At a restaurant in south Delhi, owner Raj Kumar has resorted to a 12% hike in prices of tomato-based, cottage cheese gravies which are devoured by customers.
""If the rates remain like this, we might have to think about our prices again,"" he said.

QIA closes in on Reliance Retail with $1 bn cheque at $100 bn valuation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/qia-looks-to-put-1-bn-in-reliance-retail-at-100-bn-valuation/articleshow/102127898.cms,26-07-2023,"Qatar Investment Authority
is in advanced negotiations with
Reliance Retail
to invest close to $950 million to $1 billion in the company, said people in the know. The Qatari sovereign fund is likely to invest at a $100 billion valuation, said people in the know.
This is almost 60% premium to the last round which was raised three years ago. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund invested $1.3bn for a 2.04 per cent stake in
Reliance Retail Ventures
in 2020, in a deal that valued the company then at about $62.4bn. Other shareholders of the round that saw a 10% dilution included New York-based private equity firm KKR, TPG, General Atlantic and two Abu Dhabi sovereign investment funds. QIA did not invest in that round.
At $100 billion,
Reliance
Retail will outpace global peers including Tesco, Carrefour, Uniqlo and JD.com. In India, Reliance Retail, the largest player already, is more than three times bigger than the largest listed retail chain
Avenue Supermarts
, that owns Dmart.
Talks have been ongoing for months but were stuck on valuations. The QIA board is yet to clear the proposal but is expected to do so early next month.
This is being seen as a funding round before the listing of the retail vertical. One of the sources even suggested that based on QIA’s investment setting a third party benchmark, Reliance Retail will try to raise another $3-4 billion over a period of time from existing institutional investors, long only capital pools and SWFs.

QIA declined to comment. Reliance Retail was not immediately available for comment.
Financial Times was the first to break the news earlier on Wednesday.
In recent times, QIA has become a proactive investor in India competing with peers from Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. It has backed James Murdoch’s new media and education venture in India, Bodhi Tree besides backing start-ups like Byju’s, Rebel Foods and Swiggy apart from a large real estate portfolio.
Reliance Retail (RRL) houses
RIL
's core retail businesses, including Reliance Digital, Jio Mart and over 18500 brick-and-mortar stores. With annual sales of Rs1.99 lakh crore, the Ambani owned retailer is nearly three times the combined scale of the next three Indian retailers.
RRL is fully owned by Reliance Retail Ventures, which also has other retail operations such as international partnerships and fast moving consumer goods business.
AMONG TOP TEN RETAILERS BY VALUE
Global investment firm Bernstein in a report in May valued the holding company RRVL at $131 billion. RIL owns 85% of RRVL, which in turn owns more than 99% of Reliance Retail.
The company said the fair value of Reliance Retail (RRL), as determined by two independent valuers Ernst & Young
Merchant Banking Services
and BDO Valuation Advisory, are Rs 884.03 and Rs 849.08 a share, respectively. This would mean Reliance Retail is worth between $93 and $97 billion.
A
JM Financial
report on 9 July, however, said this number is the grossed up value for potential tax liabilities for the minority shareholders to ensure net amount payable to minorities is around Rs 850-900 per share.
""Hence, the implied valuation of RRL as per independent valuers valuation is $100 billion. Accordingly, we estimate equity value for RRVL at $105 billion, given RRVL’s EBITDA is 2-4% higher than that of RRL as it also has a few other investments and assets apart from its stake in RRL,"" the report added.
At this valuation, Amazon is more than 10 times more valuable while Walmart is four times as big. Even Alibaba, Costco, Home Depot and Nike are two to three times higher in market cap.
Reliance Industries
, owns 85 per cent of Reliance Retail Ventures, went through a fund raising spree in the middle of Covid to deverage its balance sheet that had ballooned to $21 billion on the back of its spending on its Jio mobile network, but raised over Rs 3.24 lakh crore from asset monestisation, PE funds and Gulf SWFs and followed it up with a $7 billion rights issue to clear all its debts.
A RETAIL POWERHOUSE
Reliance Retail, which is led by Mukesh Ambani’s daughter Isha Ambani announced its financial results for June quarter on Friday. Reliance Retail, the retail arm of Reliance Industries, reported a revenue of Rs 69,962 crore, which is 19.5 percent more than previous year's Rs 58,569 crore.
Reliance's market leadership is driven by expanding the store network 1.5 times over the last two years, acquiring new brands with an investment of $1.2 billion investments and ecommerce that now accounts for 18% of its sales.
In fact, Reliance Retail has expanded market share from 1.8% in FY18 to control around 3% in FY23 of the total Indian retail market.
For instance, organised retail and wholesale still account for only 10-15% of India’s overall fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales, and Reliance control more than half of the FMCG retail market. Earlier this year, German retailer Metro AG announced completion of the sale of its Indian cash and carry business of 31 stores to Reliance Retail for Rs 2,850 crore.
In the last few months, the FMCG arm of Reliance Retail Ventures has announced entry into soft drinks, beauty soaps, hygiene categories, dishwash bars and liquids, toilet and floor cleaners, besides laundry detergent powder, liquid and bars. It has also entered categories such as chocolates, biscuits and staples.
Similarly, with more than 4,000 fashion and apparel stores, including brands such as Trends, Centro, Azorte and Fashion Factory, Reliance is also by far the market leader in the segment.
Despite a high base, Reliance Retail has grown at 17% on a compounded annual rate over the last decade with consumer electronics expanding the fastest. However, in the past five years, growth has been majorly driven by fashion and lifestyle which expanded 43%, followed by groceries that grew 41%. Fashion contributes the highest to overall profitability with the widest margins at 24%.

Qatar sovereign fund looking to pick stake in Ambani's Reliance Retail: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/qatar-sovereign-fund-looking-to-pick-up-stake-in-ambanis-reliance-retail-report/articleshow/102124912.cms,26-07-2023,"Qatar's sovereign wealth fund
Qatar
Investment Authority (QIA) is looking to get a minority stake in Indian billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
's
Reliance Retail Ventures
, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing sources. The
QIA
may consider picking a minority stake in
RRVL
, the FT report said, with a $1 billion investment giving it a stake of about 1 per cent and valuing the business at around $100 billion.
FT's report has not been verified by ET independently.
Ambani had said he planned to list his retail operations at some point but was yet to give a timeline or details of his plans.
Reliance Retail Ventures houses retail operations such as international partnerships and consumer goods business.
Reliance Retail, headed by the billionaire's daughter Isha Ambani, has core retail businesses that include digital and brick-and-mortar stores.

It has partnered, in recent years, with a slew of global brands like Burberry, Pret A Manger and Tiffany to launch and expand their presence in India.
Calculations by global brokerage firm JPMorgan peg
Reliance
Retail’s enterprise value at $112 billion and implied equity value at $102 billion. UBS has valued it at $110 billion, Bernstein at $111 billion while domestic brokerage
JM Financial
estimates it at $105 billion.
""We estimate equity value for Reliance Retail
Ventures Ltd
(RRVL) at Rs 8,600 billion or $105 bn, given RRVL’s EBITDA is 2-4% higher than that of RRL as it also has a few other investments/assets apart from its stake in RRL,"" JM Financial said.
In 2020,
RIL
sold a 10.52% stake in RRVL to various PE investors when the company was valued at around Rs 4.2-4.3 lakh crore.
In its recently released financial statement, Reliance said that its retail business recorded a quarterly revenue of Rs 69,948 crore, up 19.5 per cent YoY while EBITDA of Rs 5,139 crore was up 33.9 per cent YoY.
It opened 555 stores in the quarter.
“I am delighted to share that our financial performance in the quarter has been resilient and aligned with our business goals. The sustained growth across consumption baskets has further consolidated our
position as a market leader. We continue to innovate and invest in our stores and digital platforms
to make shopping more engaging for our customers,"" said Isha M Ambani, Executive Director, RRVL.
RIL’s retail business is the category leader in organized retail across grocery, fashion & lifestyle, electronics.

'Mass' consumers with income between Rs 2.5-10 lakh to be growth engine for eCommerce market: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/mass-consumers-with-income-between-rs-2-5-10-lakh-to-be-growth-engine-for-ecommerce-market-report/articleshow/102121284.cms,26-07-2023,"The
retail boom
in
India
will be driven mainly by those who are earning between Rs 2.5-10 lakh annually and presents a $1.3 trillion opportunity by 2030, a new report has stated.
This segment of 'mass' consumers is projected to drive ~US$ 1.3 trillion in the overall
Indian retail
market and nearly 45% of the $300 billion
eCommerce opportunity
in India by 2030.
‘Mass’ consumers may drive more than ~USD 135 Bn GMV of the USD 300 Bn total eCommerce opportunity in India by 2030. The report said that this segment looks for 'bang for buck' or products that offer the highest value for money. Internet has become a major source in their purchase decision making journey to locate the best deals and has made them equally tech-savvy as the affluent segment.
The report by
Redseer
found ~75% of the
mass consumers
comprised of millennials and
Gen-Z
consumers.
""While Gen-Z, who are young and independent, show purchase preference for apparel, BPC, and electronics, the value-driven independent millennials tilted towards BPC (beauty & personal care), food & grocery, and apparel. Gen-X constituted about 13% and spent a higher share on food and grocery, followed by health and wellness. Although Gen-Z consumers have distinct characteristics from older generations, they are also value-conscious at the core,"" the report adds.

The survey also found that this segment is also willing to tilt towards unbranded items if they liked the quality. The three factors that guide purchase decision for this segment include- prices/deals and discounts on eCommerce platforms, quality of products, and the trust on the platform.
The population- earning up Rs 10 lakh- comprises of the middle class. The middle class is the fastest-growing major segment of the Indian population in both percentage and absolute terms, rising at 6.3 percent per year between 1995 and 2021. It now represents 31 percent of the population and is expected to be 38 percent by 2031 and 60 percent in 2047. More than one billion Indians will make up the middle-class when India will turn 100. These are the figures from PRICE ICE 360 degree surveys based on primary data.
Within the category of the Indian Middle Class, the sub-group of Strivers—with an annual household income of between Rs 15 lakh and Rs. 30 lakh—has grown at 6.4 per cent annually between 2015- 16 and 2020-21. The Seekers, another sub-group of the Middle Class earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs. 15 lakh a year, has grown by 4.8 per cent annually during this period, as per the PRICE survey.
By the end of this decade, the survey says, the structure of the country’s demographics will change from an inverted pyramid, signifying a small rich class and a very large low-income class, to a rudimentary diamond, where a significant part of the low-income class moves up to become part of Middle Class.
Thus, the growth in the population will also serve as a catalyst to the e-commerce business in India.

Transactions in the ONDC seeing growth across the board,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/transactions-in-the-ondc-seeing-growth-across-the-board/articleshow/102082909.cms,25-07-2023,"The
Open Network for Digital Commerce
(ONDC) has been seeing an increase in transactions across the board, says
ONDC
Chief Business Officer, Shireesh Joshi. He added that while the exact numbers couldn't be revealed, the volume of orders for the brands that have joined the network has been increasing since January.
ET recently reported that a study done by the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (
ICCI
) services financial firm showed that daily transactions in the network would scale up to 200,000 from the present 80,000 by December.
Akshay D’ Souza, Bizom’s Chief of
Growth
and Insights said that while initially these companies were just testing the waters of ONDC an increase in both the order volume as well as improvements in the service level had been observed recently. This, according to him, has resulted in an increase in the number of both the suppliers and brands that were adopting the service. “There are various sectors that are now moving on to ONDC; it is not just limited to the
FMCG
sector, food and beverages are a large category that can be observed moving towards being part of the service,” he added.
He also said that Bizom had recently onboarded 30 new brands as sellers to the ONDC with 35 more brands in the process of joining the network. He added that the 35 brands in the process of joining were from across the packaged food, homecare, consumer durables, edible oils and beverages sector.
As a seller these brands would get an equal oppurtunity to compete with large market players and be discoverable online.
Live Events
Of the new brands that had joined the service, one of the most prominent was Keventer Agro, considered to be the largest Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company in Eastern India. The other brands that have joined ONDC include Polycab,Me n Moms, Mama feast, BRBChips, Ustraa, Sublime, Fackelman, Keventer, Brill, Hyderabad Foods, Healthkart, Nourish Mantra, Buy One Gram, Selzer, and Dugar Oversees.
Thampy Koshi the Chief Executive Officer of ONDC said that the reason brands which were already present in existing e-commerce platforms were moving to the service was because they realised that the network allowed them more competition, specialisation, participation and efficiency. He said that “The service offers more power to the merchant, each merchant today wants to follow their own terms of business and not have someone else dictate it, the ONDC allows them to do this and have their own terms and promotions.” He added that the ONDC currently had 120,000 merchants of which close to 52,000 were retailers.
The ONDC was launched last year with the aim of giving retailers and small businesses access to processes and technologies available to large e-commerce platforms. At present the alpha version of the service is available in 273 cities.

said it is revamping Trends fashion stores across the county by adding contemporary and tech-enabled features ranging from self-checkout counters to electronic shelf labels to attract customers of younger generations. Reliance Retail is revamping around 150
Trends stores
pan-India with a new brand identity. The stores will have a new look right from the facade to fixtures, lighting, ceiling and flooring, becoming more aspirational for shoppers, the retailer said.
Trends, an affordable fashion & lifestyle retailer which operates more than 2,300 stores in over 1,100 towns and cities across
India
, has opened its first such store with a new brand identity in Surat with several more in the pipeline to be opened shortly.
Now all new Trends stores to be opened by Reliance Retail in the future will be based on the new format, which may also have a dedicated space for local artesian to showcase the city's identity.
Reliance Fashion & Lifestyle President & CEO Akhilesh Prasad said consumers nowadays are demanding fresh and unique experiences.
""In our latest Trends store opened at VIP Road, Surat, we have introduced a brand new retail identity by incorporating several new-age tech interventions in the form of self-checkouts, electronic shelf labels, RFID-enablement and dual-sided cash tills,"" Prasad told PTI.
Live Events
Moreover, several global best practices have also been adapted for merchandising and product display, leading to quicker product discovery, he added.
Trends accounts for a major share of Reliance Retail's garment sales. It operates more than 4,000 fashion and apparel stores, housing brands such as Trends, Centro, Azorte and Fashion Factory. ""Given the brand's vast appeal across town classes, the new concept remains warm and inclusive,"" said Prasad.
He further added: ""We have dedicated space in our stores where local artists are invited to express the city's identity in their most unique/artistic ways. The start has been made with the Surat store where the city's skyline has been represented with thread work.""
The new concept is designed by an international innovation studio.
In its quarterly results last week Reliance said its retail business is witnessing a trend towards premiumisation, where people are spending more on articles such as apparel and footwear.
""On the fashion and lifestyle, our stores business for apparel and footwear, we saw a significant uptick in-store traffic as well as growing average bill values as we see people buying more items as well as a trend towards premiumisation where people are spending more,"" Reliance Retail CFO & Corporate Development Dinesh Taluja had said in the earnings call.
It is seeing a ""significant evolution"" in customer behaviour where earlier office attire and casual wear used to be different.
""We are seeing a merging of the two where the semi-casuals, both in non-office and office wear is getting acceptable. So, there's a trend where people are looking to buy something which can be used both in office and outside and we are capitalising on that trend. We are seeing a significant uptake in smart casuals as well as leisure,"" he said.

The pursuit of beauty: What explains Damani's big bet on Health and Glow?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/the-pursuit-of-beauty-what-explains-damanis-big-bet-on-health-and-glow/articleshow/102041858.cms,22-07-2023,"India's beauty and personal care market is glowing. While newer, well-funded players like
Nykaa
have dominated the sector in the recent past, it is increasingly seeing consolidation of brands or bigger conglomerates making an entry. The latest is
Radhakishan Damani
, billionaire investor and founder of
Avenue Supermarts
that runs the D-Mart chain. He has reportedly acquired
Health and Glow
, a Bangalore-based beauty and personal care retail chain from the family offices of Rajan Raheja and Hemendra Kothari for ?700-750 crore.
Launched in 1997, Health and Glow opened its first brick-and-mortar store in Chennai. The business now has a network of over 175 stores located across Indian cities including Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Pune, Mumbai, Cochin, Kolkata, Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar, and Hyderabad among other locations. In FY22, the company clocked ?200 crore topline and is expected to close FY23 with Rs 370 crore of sales with a 15% Ebitda margin.
India's beauty boom
Rising income levels, urbanisation, Internet access, rise of social media influencers and a large share of the young population are factors leading to a beauty boom in India that is projected to reach $17.4 billion by 2025 from $15.6 billion in 2022, a report by researcher Euromonitor said. In a 2021 report, global market research platform Statista said that India ranked fourth in revenue generation from the beauty and personal care market, just behind the US, China, and Japan, projecting that online sales would grow 18.2 per cent in the next few years.
As per another report by Avendus forecast, the online personal-care and beauty market in India will reach $4.4 billion by 2025. The report says the number of online beauty and personal care shoppers could increase by over four times — from 25 million in FY20 to 110 million in FY25.

Damani is not the only one with deep pockets to bet on India's growing beauty and personal care market. Last year,
Marico
Limited entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Vietnam-based personal care firm Beauty X Corporation for Rs172 crore.
In April, India’s largest retailer
Reliance
Retail Limited launched Tira, an omni-channel platform for
beauty products
. With Tira’s launch, Reliance will be taking on Nykaa, Tata Cliq Palette, Myntra and other players in the market for beauty products. Tira offers a curated assortment of the global and home-grown brands. Last year, Reliance Retail
Ventures Ltd
bought a controlling stake in makeup and personal care brand Insight Cosmetics..
Last month, Unilever said India is its top priority and “disproportionately important” for it in the beauty and well-being space where its local unit
Hindustan Unilever
controls more than half the market.
""Beauty is now considered an essential aspect of self-expression and personal well-being, leading to a surge in demand,"" Ritambra Das, co-founder at Better Beauty, told ET recently. ""Additionally, there is a widespread penetration of media and social media platforms. Beauty influencers, celebrities, and online platforms have influenced consumer preferences, creating awareness and driving the adoption of beauty products and trends.""
Global brands make a beeline
India is witnessing an influx of global beauty brands, probably the most in a year as per industry executives, as they target the country with the largest population of young people and increasing disposable income for their next phase of growth, ET reported last month.
Brands have also embarked on a retail expansion drive and global funds are looking for opportunities to invest in beauty startups as they bet on a growing market. Economic headwinds in China, Asia's biggest beauty market, too are making them turn the focus to India, say executives.
Demand for beauty products from make-up and colour cosmetics to hair-care products and fragrances is growing rapidly, fuelled by social media influencers, aspirational consumption in small cities and towns and increasing ecommerce coverage.
""India is at a place today where China was some years back in terms of aspirational growth and consumption,"" Anchit Nayar, ED at Nykaa Beauty, said in a recent interview with ET. Terming consumption patterns in India as ""very promising,"" Nayar said: ""The next ten years will look really good for beauty and retail ... this is a multi-decade story.""
Last month,
Shoppers Stop
launched an exclusive store to retail global giant Estee Lauder group's brands such as MAC and Clinique in India. The Raheja Group-owned Shoppers Stop has also signed a distribution partnership with Japanese beauty giant Shiseido-owned NARS Cosmetics for a launch in the second half of the year. In the same month, French retailer Sephora launched Hollywood singer and actress Selena Gomez-backed premium cosmetics brand Rare Beauty in India. Amazon India too joined the beauty boom by launching its global beauty store to retail more than 60 international brands. New Incubation Ventures, a fund backed by Estee Lauder Cos, too said it is identifying brands to invest in India.
L'Oréal SA, the world’s largest cosmetics company, sees India rapidly growing into a beauty epicenter of the world where the company can reach a €1 billion revenue mark in the next few years. ""From a €500 million business today, I think we can take it to €1 billion in the next foreseeable future. So very excited about India,"" Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO at L'Oréal told investors early this year. ""I don't think India will never ever look like China, but it's still a very promising market for us. We have high ambitions. Middle classes are rising in a major way. It's still not as developed as we would like in terms of distribution, but it's really accelerating and our shares are growing.""
""What's interesting is to look at this upper part of the Indian middle class, which is today, let's say 200 million to 300 million people, but which is set to double in the next five to 10 years,"" Alexis Perakis-Valat - president, consumer product division at L'Oréal told analysts. I have seen changes in the last two years like never before in terms of - in terms of sophistication of the market, in terms of change of the distribution, thanks to e-commerce. And all that powered by a super digital ecosystem. So we're very, very bullish about India.""
The new trends
The share of the premium segment of beauty and personal care products will grow to an estimated 55% of the total market in the country by 2026 from 45% at present, with a corresponding decrease in the share of the mass segment to 45% from 55% now, omnichannel beauty and fashion retailer Nykaa said in its annual investor day presentation to analysts last month. Nykaa said consumer preference in the BPC category is shifting from personal care to beauty products, as a result of growth in per capita GDP.
Experts feel another key trend to look out for in the segment is an increasing demand for clean beauty products, drawing a higher focus on ingredients, sourcing and environmental consciousness, and diversity.
An emerging men's market
The men’s grooming market is worth Rs 20,000 crore, of which the men’s shaving space is about a fourth, indicating huge opportunity, according to a recent report by Elara Securities. About 117 new male grooming brands have entered the market recently but an average man spends just $20 annually on grooming.
""Beard management is posting a growth of 20% per annum and is expected to do well. The beauty and personal care market in India is pegged at $25 billion in 2022 compared to the US at $86 billion and China at $60 billion. It is a profitable category as unit economics with gross margin on the higher side in the range of 55-65%,"" said the report.
The category is dominated by mass beauty firms, with a 45% market share, held by the top few companies, such as Hindustan Unilever, P&G,
Dabur
and Marico. Standalone beauty retail has bounced back since COVID-19. Omni-channel will continue to drive sales.
""We are also seeing a rise in the number of homegrown brands emerging from smaller towns and cities, as entrepreneurs tap into the growing demand for male grooming products and services in India's tier 2 and 3 markets. This is a promising trend for the industry as a whole, as it suggests that there is ample room for innovation and growth in the years to come,"" Prashant Narang, Cofounder, Agility Ventures, said recently.

"Use of AI expands scope of B2B networking, augments jobs, says IndiaMart CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/use-of-ai-expands-scope-of-b2b-networking-augments-jobs-says-indiamart-ceo/articleshow/102034663.cms,22-07-2023,"The use of artificial intelligence has expanded the scope of business-to-business networking, triggering the need for a bigger workforce in the sector, according to
Dinesh Agarwal
, CEO of online B2B marketplace
IndiaMart
.
IndianMart, which connects bulk buyers to relevant suppliers of various products and services on its platform, has improved its match-making ratio with the use of artificial intelligence like application of voice search, interpretation of mixed language or misspelt words, Agarwal said.
""Voice search is something that was not possible before artificial intelligence; voice recognition only became perfect in the last 3-4-5 years...image recognition or image classification was not very perfect and even today, it is in the process of being perfected. So, we are trying to find many more use cases through various artificial intelligence innovations that are happening around the world,"" he said.
The company has kept on adding around 200 employees every quarter after the Covid-19 pandemic.
""...every time a technology comes, the nature of the job changes, not the
jobs
get reduced. In fact, jobs get augmented because whatever you could not do earlier, now you can serve even that market...this actually expands the business horizon and that's why we need more people,"" he said.

The company has added around 60,000 customers to reach the milestone of 2.80 lakh user base on its platform in the past 18 months since the beginning of the economic recovery process post-Covid-19.
In order to serve an increased number of traffic on the platform, Agarwal said the company expects to add around 1,000 people to its workforce every year.
""Before Covid, we had 3,500-odd people and during Covid, because we did not hire for 18 months, it came down to less than 3,000 people. Now, we are almost touching 5,500 people. So I think, we have added a lot more number of people and even in this quarter we have added approx 200 people,"" Agarwal said.
In line with the business growth, ""we can see about 20 per cent number of people being added in a year"", he added.
Asked about any competition likely to be faced by IndiaMart and other such platforms due to the introduction of Open Network Digital Commerce, a government's initiative to connect service providers and suppliers with their target audience directly, Agarwal said the adoption of ONDC in B2B space will take longer.
The networking process becomes complex as B2B transactions are more bulky and are carried out in a highly customisable manner, he explained.
""In the ONDC...moving parts are too many. You have to work on logistics, you have to work on payments, you have to work on search, you have to work on delivery, and you have to work on refund...It is a lot more complex and a lot more ambitious. It will take some time, but if it becomes successful, it will be good for the country,"" he added.
In order to leverage the increasing international trade involving Indian suppliers, especially after Covid, IndiaMart said it has re-launched its export offering and has witnessed around 7,000 exporters using the platform since 2021.
According to Agarwal, India's exports picked up during Covid, when the demand for medical supplies shot up. At the same time, the government's move to reduce corporate tax from 30 per cent to 25 per cent also added competitiveness of Indian exporters.
""We re-launched our export offering in 2021 only and we are very happy to see that we have already been able to get about 6,000-7,000-plus exporters on our platform doing handsome business,"" he said.
Besides, IndiaMart has also integrated international payment facilitation services on its platform.
""We also facilitate international payments now through Tazapay (payment gateway), a company we have partnered with...They are able to facilitate international payments at zero per cent pricing...only the rupee-to-dollar conversion or rupee-to-euro conversion charges are charged,"" he added.
On Thursday, IndiMart reported a 78 per cent rise in its net profit at Rs 83 crore in the April-June quarter, riding on an increased user base that led to higher revenue.
The company also announced the plan to buy back 12,50,000 equity shares worth Rs 500 crore, saying that increased cash flow has prompted the firm to return money to its shareholders.
The consolidated revenue from operations stood at Rs 282 crore in the reporting quarter, registering a growth of 26 per cent year-on-year, ""primarily driven by a 16 per cent increase in number of paying subscription suppliers"", the company said.
The platform, with about 75 lakh free suppliers and 2 lakh paying subscribers onboard, claims to have a 60 per cent market share in the online B2B marketplace space, witnessing more than 2 crore unique buying enquiries every quarter.

B2C shine makes up for the cloud over O2C at Reliance Industries,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/b2c-shine-makes-up-for-the-cloud-over-o2c-at-reliance-industries/articleshow/102028959.cms,22-07-2023,"Reliance Industries
' consumer-facing verticals, such as retailing and telecom, demonstrated sustained
revenue
momentum in the June quarter to make up 40% of aggregate sales, cushioning the profitability impact at India's most-valued conglomerate that had a stellar year-ago quarter due to record refining margins at its traditional oil-to-chemicals (O2C) businesses.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
The biggest growth driver in the June quarter was the retail business, which clocked revenue of about ₹70,000 crore and was able to record more than 19% growth for the second three-month period in a row. The operating profit of the retail business climbed to 7.4% in June 2023 - the highest ever - even though Reliance opened 555 new stores, taking the total tally to 18,446 outlets.
Reliance
Retail's contribution climbed to 27% of total revenue - one of the highest ever. Furthermore, at the aggregate level, the projected earnings point to an upcycle soon. No wonder the stock, India's most valued, has started outperforming the broader index in the past three months.
More phone subscribers and footfalls at the retailing outlets more than mitigated the inevitable earnings pressure on the more cyclical O2C segment, where profitability is tied to regional refining margin benchmarks that are now about a fifth of where they were a year ago.
Singapore
Region GRM
To be sure, the O2C segment has been under pressure after the Singapore gross refining margin - a regional benchmark of refineries' profitability - fell nearly $4.2 in just three months to $4.1 per barrel in the June 2023 quarter, as realisation on sales of petroleum products such gasoline and diesel shrank. In the same quarter last fiscal, the same gauge was at a multiyear high of $20.93 per barrel. In the petrochemical segment, destocking and lower growth in
China
kept a lid on product pricing.
Hence, the operating profit of the O2C segment fell 23%, while delivering a margin of 11.48%. At the aggregate level, net profit shrinkage was limited to 6%. However, lower scheduled refinery capacity addition globally and an improving macro condition toward the latter half of the year should boost the performance of the O2C segment. In addition, the cost of ethane has corrected 20% on a year-to-date basis. Ethane accounts for nearly half the feedstock for petrochemicals.
Telecom Business
Separately,
Reliance Jio
added 9.2 million subscribers in the three months to June - the highest in four quarters, taking the total tally to 448.5 million subscribers. India's largest telecom operator has been able to expand its average revenue per user (
ARPU
) by 2.8% YoY to ₹180.5 owing to a better subscriber mix and ramp-up of the wireline business. Subscriber additions for
Jio
could further benefit from the Jio Bharat phone as it would help to target 250 million subscriber transition from 2G to 4G.
With capex intensity easing and multiple businesses close to monetisation, investor interest in Reliance is likely to sustain. The company spent ₹39,645 crore on capex in the June quarter, compared with ₹44,413 crore in the March quarter.

Radhakishan Damani buys Health & Glow for ₹750 cr,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/radhakishan-damani-buys-health-glow-for-750-cr/articleshow/101996023.cms,21-07-2023,"Radhakishan Damani
, billionaire investor and founder of
Avenue Supermarts
that runs the D-Mart chain, has acquired
Health and Glow
, a Bangalore-based
beauty and personal care
retail chain from the family offices of Rajan Raheja and Hemendra
Kothari
for ₹700-750 crore, said people in the know.
Industrialist Rajan Raheja, with interests in cement, tiles, financial services and automotives, owns
Exide
Batteries, Raheja QBE General Insurance, a joint venture between his listed company
Prism Johnson
and Australia's QBE Insurance and Outlook publishing Group. He sold a majority stake in his cable TV venture Hathaway to
Reliance Industries
.
Veteran investment banker Hemendra Kothari chairs DSP Investment Managers, which has $15 billion in assets under management. He founded the firm in 2008 in partnership with BlackRock, but bought out the Wall Street asset manager's stake 10 years later. He also partnered with Merrill Lynch in 1995 but sold his 57% stake in tranches between 2005 and 2009.
Bombay Swadeshi
This would be Damani's second buyout ever after
Bombay Swadeshi Stores
in 2015, the country's oldest retailer that counted freedom fighters Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mummohandas Ramji and industrialist JRD Tata as its founding fathers, for ₹42 crore.
Live Events
The transaction was done via Damani's flagship investment vehicle Bright Star Investments. The transaction, thus far kept private, was signed late last week.
According to corporate shareholding data available till June 2023, Damani publicly holds 14 stocks with a net worth over ₹166,949.6 crore with the largest being
VST Industries
where he is the single largest shareholder and
India Cements
, where his 21% ownership makes him the single largest public (non-promoter group) investor. Apart from being an investor in His other retail sector exposure is in
Trent
, the chain backed by Tata Group.
Among the earliest specialised beauty and personal care retailers, the 26-year old chain was originally a joint venture between Spencer Retail and Hong Kong-based Dairy Farm. The duo also launched Food World which was subsequently sold to Kishore Biyani of Future Group. With Spencer and Dairy Farm both exiting their initial alliance over the years, in 2015-16, Kothari and Raheja bought out the Health and Glow chain, a year after FoodWorld got sold.
Health and Glow
Launched in 1997, Health and Glow opened its first brick-and-mortar store in Chennai. The business now has a network of over 175 stores located across Indian cities including Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Pune, Mumbai, Cochin, Kolkata, Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar, and Hyderabad among other locations. In FY22, the company clocked ₹200 crore topline and is expected to close FY23 with Rs 370 crore of sales with a 15% Ebitda margin.
In an earlier interview, the company's management said the key focus will primarily harp on - personalisation, omnichannel presence, innovation in efficacious products.
""The challenge will be to make it a pan India brand and make it truly omni-channel. It is still primarily a physical format."" said an official in the know.
Representatives of Damani's family office including, the chain's CEO and MD K Venkataramani did not respond to ET's queries. Efforts to reach out to the Kothari and Raheja family office on their mobile phones remained unanswered. Arpwood, the advisor to the deal, was also unavailable.
The beauty and personal care market of India is estimated to be $18.3 billion by the end of the 2023 calendar year, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. But newer, well funded players like
Nykaa
have dominated the sector in the recent past which is increasingly seeing consolidation of brands or bigger conglomerates making an entry.

The Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) mandates to complete CIRP within 330 days, which includes time taken during litigations.
The CIRP was initiated against FRL by NCLT on July 20, 2022, following loan default.
As per Section 12(1) of the Code, the CIRP shall be completed within a period of 180 days from the date of initiation.
However, NCLT may grant a one-time extension of 90 days. The maximum time within which CIRP must be mandatorily completed, including any extension or litigation period, is 330 days.
Earlier, FRL had said it had received six bids from prospective buyers by May 15, which was the last date for submission of resolution plans.
The deadline for submission of resolution plans was May 15, 2023, for 48 companies, which were in the final list of 'Eligible Prospective Resolution Applicants'.
This has happened despite FRL lenders coming with revised Expressions of Interest (EoIs) and inviting fresh bids after dividing its assets into clusters.
Future Retail
has a debt of around Rs 30,000 crore and the company is going through CIRP.
On March 23, 2023, creditors of FRL invited new EoIs whereby prospective buyers can bid for the debt-ridden firm ""as a going concern or individual cluster or a combination of clusters of its assets"", as it failed to attract a resolution plan in more than four months.
FRL operated multiple retail formats in both the hypermarket supermarket and home segments under brands such as Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Foodhall. At its peak, FRL was operating more than 1,500 outlets in nearly 430 cities.
It was part of the 19 Future group companies operating in the retail, wholesale, logistic and warehousing segments, which were supposed to be transferred to
Reliance Retail
as part of a Rs 24,713-crore deal announced in August 2020.
However, lenders had rejected the takeover of the 19 Future group companies, including FRL, by
Reliance
amid a legal challenge by Amazon.

EOSS fails to lift sales for retailers this year,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/eoss-fails-to-lift-sales-for-retailers-this-year/articleshow/101966766.cms,19-07-2023,"End of season sales (EOSS) has failed to lift sales for
retailers
this year, reporting only 7% growth in June from a year ago, despite
EOSS
starting early.
Delhi rains
made it worse in July for shopping complexes as shoppers preferred to stay indoors during the flood-like situation.
According to the Retail Business Survey by the Retailers Association of
India
(RAI), June 2023 showed a moderate growth of 7% compared to the sales levels during the same period last year.
Last year, the growth rate in June was over 50% due to the low base of 2021. But in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, growth was 13% for the same month.
""The growth has been muted and is expected to continue like this till September. The EOSS start was very slow but there has been some improvement in the last two weeks. Still, in comparison to last year and pre pandemic, it's very muted,"" said Lifestyle CEO Devarajan Iyer.

Retailers were expecting some recovery by offering hefty discounts during the end of season sales, but there has been only a marginal growth in both footfall and sale.
""Due to the slow growth rate in the last 3-4 months, we have also slowed down the expansion. We were planning to open one store every 30 days, now we are opening one at 50 days. We expect the festive buying to start from September, that will help in double-digit growth,"" said Sameer Manglani, owner of Meena Bazaar.
According to RAI data, south India reported growth of 8%, while east India and west India indicated a growth of 7% and 6%, followed by north India at 5%.
""Food & grocery and footwear showed growth at 15%, while jewellery showed 14% growth. As consumers are now getting into their normal business routines, we are witnessing moderate growth over previous year,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI).
Retailers traditionally launch EOSS by June end, before fresh season merchandise hits their shelves. However, brands started the sale mid-June and it's likely to continue till the end of July.
Retailers who largely focus on to clear out inventory during EOSS are now hoping for festive season to improve sales.
""Growth rate has flattened for the last few months, and even the EOSS couldn't change it. Rain has not helped either. There is still some stress in the markets outside the top 8-9 cities,"" said Satyen Momaya, CEO of French apparel brand Celio.
The growth rate has slowed down March onwards, indicating slowest sales expansion in over 14 months.
Mall operators in Delhi-NCR said rain was not helping either, as consumers are worried about getting stuck in traffic.
""The footfall has gone down due to the rain as people are cautious. This has resulted in slowdown of sales as well,"" said Harsh V Bansal, co-founder of the Unity group that operates over half a dozen malls in Delhi and Punjab.

Unlike grocery startups
Amazon
and
BigBasket
, which rely on a delivery-based distribution model, DMart’s online venture operates a hybrid model with delivery centres in areas where it has small stores from where customers can also pick up products they have ordered online. With annual sales of Rs41833 crore, DMart, runs 324 stores, generating
revenue
of Rs 31,096 per square foot, almost three times that of its rivals in India. The retailer also had 49 distribution centres and 10 packing centres during FY23.
Avenue Supermarts chairman
Ramesh Damani
, in the annual report said, the global macro headwinds notwithstanding, India remains a bright spot and in comparison to other subcontinent countries, India has remained resilient from geopolitical and other disruptions. ""Since FY2017-18, we have more than doubled our store count to 324 despite the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020. Our strong belief in our business model and focused execution have driven this steady growth,"" Damani added.
During the quarter ended June, the flagship company D'Mart saw its revenue growth at 18% year on year, lowest in any quarter compared to the pre-Covid levels. Profit growth was even lower in low single digits as sales remained impacted by sustained pressure on recovery of discretionary non-FMCG.
""We believe this is largely due to drag from lower sales of general merchandise and apparels, cannibalization from store addition in existing areas and possible share loss to online and e-commerce players,"" said a report by
Axis Capital
.

Providing
self-employment
to 78,000 entrepreneurs in Karnataka, including 34,000 women, the direct selling business in the State posted a sales increase of Rs 94 crore in 2021-22, a 9.09 per cent growth over the previous year's figure of Rs 1,034 crore, the self-regulatory body for the direct selling industry in India said.

During 2021-22, the State also contributed nearly Rs 170 crore to the exchequer by way of taxes, it was stated.
IDSA Chairman
Rajat Banerji

Small shopkeepers struggle after RuPay-UPI integration due to KYC norms,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/small-shopkeepers-struggle-after-rupay-upi-integration-due-to-kyc-norms/articleshow/101820561.cms,19-07-2023,"Small shopkeepers who are able to process payments through credit cards using a QR code are facing inconvenience over completing know-your-customer (KYC) requirements after the integration of RuPay with
UPI
.
For the shopkeepers, UPI emerges as an easier option as it only involves the creation of an issuer account for accepting payments.
However, for them to accept credit card payments using a QR code, the shopkeepers have to follow the
payment
network’s guidelines, which necessitate a merchant KYC process.
This is a significant task for payments companies that have deployed QR codes at small shops throughout the country, said TOI quoting Arpit Ratan, founder of
Signzy
, a fintech company specialising in digital customer onboarding after KYC compliance.
RBI’s norms for permitting KYC verification are more stringent than those of SEBI which uses AI for KYC video verification.

tomato prices
skyrocket, online grocery delivery firm
BigBasket

Tomato Puree
instead! Made with 100% ripe tomatoes,"" the company urged on its mobile application.
Online grocery delivery firms such as BigBasket,
Zepto
and
Blinkit
, along with several offline retailers, are witnessing a surge in demand for tomato puree and frozen vegetables as the prices of fresh produce hit the roof. Demand is so high that retailers are running out of stock and manufacturers are ramping up production.
Fresh tomato prices were ruling at Rs 112 per kg in the retail market in Delhi, up from Rs 28 per kg about a month ago. A 200 ml container of puree, equivalent to using about 450 gm of tomatoes, costs Rs 27.
A spokesperson for
Dabur
said that demand for tomato puree brand Hommade has surged and that it's working hard to keep up with it. Mother Dairy, one of the largest players in the puree and frozen vegetables segment, has seen a 300% increase in the demand for tomato puree and 50% increase in that for frozen vegetables at its stores in the last two weeks. ""Production has been ramped up for our tomato puree to take care of the surge in demand,"" said a spokesperson for Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable, which owns the Safal brand of purees and frozen vegetables.

McDonald's has stopped using tomatoes in its burgers and wraps in many outlets as price pulps menus
Quick commerce company Zepto has seen a 120% rise in sales of tomato puree compared with the first week of June.
Rains Add to Supply Gaps
""Tomato ketchup sales are also 10% higher than in the first week of June,"" a company spokesperson said.
Prices of fruits and vegetables have shot up due to excessive rain and floods in northern states such as Himachal Pradesh. Apart from tomatoes, which are selling at Rs 140 per kg at the Azadpur wholesale market in New Delhi, prices of almost all vegetables including green peas, French beans, ginger and coriander have doubled and are selling well above Rs 100 per kg in the wholesale market.

""There is a surge in demand (for tomato puree) as well as shortage of supply in equal measure,"" said Amit Dutta, chief executive of grocery retailer Le Marche Retail. ""Stocks of puree have dried up even at B2B wholesalers, so there is a gap at the moment which might only widen further as the pipeline has been almost finished.""
In order to fill the supply gap,
BigBasket

""To reduce the customer discomfort, we are selling tomatoes almost at cost,"" said Seshu Kumar, chief buying and merchandising officer, BigBasket, which has seen the sales of tomato puree double since the first week of June.

"Omega, Rolex watch demand booms despite rising prices",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/omega-rolex-watch-demand-booms-despite-rising-prices/articleshow/101737006.cms,13-07-2023,"Omega producer
Swatch Group AG
and the UK’s biggest retailer of
Rolex watches
signaled the appetite for Swiss timepieces remains healthy even as prices go higher. Swatch shares rose as much as 7% as Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said revenue may reach a record this year helped by demand in China and the US. Separately, Watches of Switzerland Group Plc surged as much as 18% after the UK retailer said demand for luxury timepieces is still solid despite price increases by some of the biggest brands.
Demand for lower-priced watches in Asia and the US remains strong, Hayek said in an interview. He added that China’s return has yet to reach full strength. First-half earnings exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time.
Swiss watch
exports have continued to increase in 2023 after reaching a record of more than 24 billion francs ($28 billion) last year. The reports assuaged concern that demand for luxury goods in the US might be waning. Exports to that market dipped in April.
“What is really impressive is the United States as well as Europe across all price segments,” Hayek said.
Average sales per store rose 30% worldwide, boosting the amount of revenue Swatch Group gets from its own retail network to 40% of its total.

“Here you see the strength of the consumption, even in the United States,” the CEO said.
Operating profit advanced 36% to 686 million francs in the first half, the maker of Omega and Longines watches said Thursday. Analysts expected 604 million francs.
Revenue reached 4 billion francs, topping the previous first half record hit in 2018. Sales in Hong Kong tripled while mainland China grew by double digits.
The company said growth was strongest in the lowest price segment of watches and jewelry. Demand for the company’s popular Omega MoonSwatch collaboration, priced at around $260, has accelerated.
Tourist destinations such as Thailand and Macau benefited from a recovery in travel, Swatch Group said. Sales in Switzerland gained 50%, followed by strong growth in markets such as Italy, Spain and France.
A weak US dollar and euro against the franc shaved 242 million francs from first-half revenue.
Management sees “excellent” growth opportunities for the second half of 2023. “The only cloud on the horizon remains the unfavorable currency environment.”
Omega and some other
Swatch brands
recently raised prices by about 8% in the US, which could offset part of the foreign-exchange impact. Hayek said he didn’t expect the price rise to hurt sales as new product launches will boost demand, he said.
Watches of Switzerland reported sales of £1.54 billion ($2 billion) for the year through April, matching analyst consensus estimates. The company reiterated its full-year forecast for 2024.
Wait lists for the most in-demand timepieces are increasing and average selling prices are growing, CEO Brian Duffy said in an interview.
“Elevated conditions remain and we are adding more people to the waiting lists than we are managing to take off despite us editing down some of the names,” Duffy said.

Big offline mobile retailers eyeing ONDC storefronts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/big-offline-mobile-retailers-eyeing-ondc-storefronts/articleshow/101707524.cms,13-07-2023,"New Delhi: Big offline smartphone
retailers
are exploring entering the Open Network for
Digital Commerce
(
ONDC
), with around 50 of them looking to open storefronts on the government-backed
ecommerce network
that they expect will help them reduce cost and reach more consumers.
A pan-India retailer association met top ONDC officials to understand how the platform works, and how they could be a part of it. Discussions are still in the early stages.
""ONDC is not charging any commission yet, and even when they will, it will be much lesser than the big
ecommerce
firms,"" said Kailash Lakhyani, founder of the All India
Mobile Retailers
Association (AIMRA), which represents more than 200,000 offline retailers across the country.
Opening online storefronts will help retailers reduce the cost of doing business, AIMRA general secretary Navneet Pathak said. ""We will be in a position to reach a wider consumer base and also get the best prices for logistics.""
He said compared with ecommerce, offline retailers have to bear higher costs for displaying products, which can be reduced once the platform matures.

However, a major roadblock for retailers to enter the ecommerce space is the agreements they have in place with smartphone brands which do not permit them to sell stocks outside of their brick and mortar stores.
The ONDC platform, launched in 2022, currently has more than 39,000 sellers across nine domains, with a presence in 273 cities pan-India, according to its website.
The major ecommerce firms charge around 5-30% commissions from sellers, Lakhyani said.
On ONDC, sellers will have to bear the shipping charges, and do their own promotions on social media.
Sangeetha Mobiles, a mobile phone retail chain in South India, opened its online storefront on the platform last month, selling smartphones, laptops and other electronics across South India and Delhi. The company has not yet seen much success in selling products on the platform, said director Chandu Reddy.
Lakhyani, who owns BigC, a chain of retail stores in
Andhra Pradesh
and Telangana, said his company is exploring opening a digital storefront by next month, to test waters ahead of the festive season. ""With the nature of the markets changing, it is important for the brands to allow retailers to sell their products through the ONDC platform,"" AIMRA's Pathak said.
Industry experts said smartphone brands spend significantly more in sending stocks to offline channels, which contribute around 55-60% to smartphone sales annually. ""Brands will not want stocks diverted to other channels after spending on distributorship, employing in-store representatives, and spending on marketing and promotions, along with offering incentives to the retailers,"" an industry executive told ET.

Subsequently, by way of a slump sale, FEL would sell the retail and wholesale businesses including Big Bazaar, fbb, Foodhall, Easyday, Nilgiris, Central and Brand Factory to Reliance Retail & Fashion Lifestyle, and the logistics and warehouse business to Reliance Retail
Ventures Ltd
.
The administrator, who has invited resolution plans from the EoI applicants by August 24, has admitted Rs 12,265 crore of verified claims from lenders and Rs 23 crore of claims from fixed deposit holders.
Future's Assets
The company has assets in the form of building and furniture valuing Rs 715 crore, according to a note circulated by RP inviting EoI. The company has leased retail infrastructure valuing Rs 2,644 crore to Future Retail and Rs 92 crore to
Praxis Home Retail
, the same document stated.
FEL had significant borrowings in the form of bonds, and thus, several trusteeship companies have filed claims. Centbank Financial Services has filed the highest claim of Rs 3,344 crore, followed by Axis Trustee Services at Rs 1,341 crore and Vistra ITCL (India) at Rs 210 crore.
Four Future Group companies - Future Enterprises, Future Retail, Future Lifestyles Fashion Ltd and Future Supply Chain - are undergoing insolvency proceedings.
The Future Group, which was already over-leveraged, suffered a setback due to the nationwide lockdown announced in 2020 to curb the spread of Covid-19. Most of its hypermarket stores located in malls remained shut for several months.
In August 2020, the deal with Reliance collapsed due to a series of litigations by e-commerce giant Amazon.com claiming a violation of the shareholder agreement it had with the company delayed the deal.
In March 2022, Reliance Industries took possession of the premises housing some 900 Future Retail stores citing non-payment of rent. In April last year, most secured lenders rejected the deal with Reliance Industries. Thereafter, the four Future group companies were admitted for corporate insolvency.

Footwear brand Attitudist aims Rs 100 crore annual sales by 2025,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/footwear-brand-attitudist-aims-rs-100-crore-annual-sales-by-2025/articleshow/101675705.cms,11-07-2023,"Attitudist
, a direct to consumer (D2C) footwear brand, aims to generate Rs 100 crore in annual sales by 2025, helped by surging demand for handcrafted vegan products. The company, launched during the peak pandemic period in July 2020, clocked Rs 25 crore in two years after operations, and sources products from small handcrafted manufacturers.
""During the pandemic, we recognized the struggle of numerous small-scale artisans who were left without any business. In addition, they were grappling with the unpredictability of offline markets, the increasing shift towards online businesses and sales, and issues such as inventory and capital blocking and space concerns. These obstacles also extended into online marketplaces,"" said
Haritima Mishra
, the 21-year-old founder of the men's footwear brand.
During covid, D2C companies took incumbents by surprise by innovating products to address niche spaces by leveraging consumer data and insights, etc. ""Headstart helped D2C companies gain market share, but journey hereon may not be easy since incumbents have started to use the same playbook of D2C companies such as launching competing products, being agile across business operations, looking at digital business from separate P&L, talent perspective, etc,"" said a report by Ambit Capital.
Attitudist does not own manufacturing set-up but has partnered over 100 local artisans and craftsmen in and around Agra to make vegan leather products. It claimed vegan leather offers various benefits - from cruelty free and durable to ensuring it remains undamaged even during difficult weather conditions such as heavy rains.
Within the lifestyle and discretionary segments, footwear witnessed one of the highest growth last fiscal year, growing 34%, over (pre-pandemic) 2019, according to the Retailers Association of India. The Delhi based firm said it wants to promote vegan footwear, and Indian handcrafted footwear manufacturing at a global level.

Low-cost fashion will be a primary clothing and footwear segment of focus for consumers, with the emergence of India's middle-class driving demand and most retailers are trying to ensure that they cater to this price-sensitive consumer.
""Attitudist was born out of a cause. Understanding their challenges, we came up with a solution to their struggles by offering them an online sales channel. Moreover, Attitudist aims to make designs that have a feel of luxury but are affordable for everyone,"" added Mishra.

RP has also received claims worth Rs 38.66 crore from the employees/workmen of FLFL which are also under verification.
""The claims received are under verification and will be verified once we receive access to the accounting system of the Corporate Debtor (FLFL),"" said the RP.
Earlier, on May 4, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had directed to initiate CIRP against FLFL, admitting a petition from the Bank of India.
On June 19, 2023, its Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) Ravi Sethia was appointed as RP of the company by the CoC.
This is the third company of the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, which has been dragged into CIRP by its creditors for defaulting on the loans.
Its flagship firm
Future Retail Ltd
and logistics & infra-arm
Future Enterprises
are already facing insolvency proceedings.
FLFL was considering asset monetisation to pare-off debts, however, it did not materialise. It had entered into a One Time Restructuring (OTR) plan with lenders also.
It has in-house retail chains Central and Brand Factory, exclusive brand outlets (EBOs) and other multi-brand outlets (MBOs) of nearly a dozen apparel labels, including Lee Cooper, Champion, aLL, Indigo Nation, Giovani, John Miller, Scullers, Converse and Urbana in its portfolio.
FLFL was part of the 19 group companies operating in retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing segments, which were supposed to be transferred to
Reliance
Retail as part of a Rs 24,713-crore deal announced in August 2020.
The deal was called-off by billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led
Reliance Industries Ltd
in April. After that several Future Group companies had several defaults on payments.

Men step out most for buying grocery,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/men-step-out-most-for-buying-grocery/articleshow/101602795.cms,09-07-2023,"About two-thirds of shopping for groceries and daily essentials are done by men in the country, contradicting the notion that women typically buy household products from neighbourhood stores, according to a study by
Kirana Club
, which has one million kirana stores in its network. However, four states — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand — were exceptions, with women accounting for half the shopping visits.
Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar have the highest percentage of male shoppers, according to the data — 56-69%. By considering the cultural context, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies can better meet needs and preferences in different states, experts said. “Upon a quick comparison with the female literacy rate, a clear correlation emerges,” said Anshul Gupta, founder of Kirana Club.
“In states, where men typically have more control over out door activities, it is likely that they also play a dominant role in
grocery shopping
.” Understanding these regional dynamics is crucial for FMCG companies as they develop marketing strategies and product offerings tailored to effectively engage consumers in these areas, he said.
In India, kiranawallahs or local grocers account for three-fourths of FMCG sales, and most companies have been trying to increase direct reach. Despite most men buying FMCG products, women typically dictate and influence the shopping list, making them key target consumers, said companies.
Live Events
“While our target consumers are predominantly women, we also focus on men consumers in our advertising and communication on general entertainment channels,” said Krishnarao Buddha, senior category head at
Parle Products
. “In addition, we find that men tend to digress a bit from the list and look for budget-friendly items and are also tapped more for impulse categories such as snacking.
To stock kirana shelves, most companies have been relying on visits from sales reps to take orders. This is now being replaced with technology. During the pandemic, most companies including
Hindustan Unilever
,
ITC
and
Marico
launched their internal ordering apps and have since onboarded millions of mom-and-pop stores to the platforms.
For instance, HUL's Shikhar app now has 600,000 retailers on the platform, where it can push sales and also influence buying decisions through offers and promotions.
Experts said the shopping behaviour of both genders is also guided by shopping occasions. “If there is a planned purchase which is usually in bulk and has heavier items, men typically shop and carry the products home while women buy smaller products as top-up throughout the month,” said Koteshwar LN, business head at Flipkart Wholesale, an online B2B marketplace of the ecommerce platform.
“Also, shopkeepers play a crucial role in influencing buying decisions by suggesting products either from price or quality standpoint irrespective of which gender is buying.

It also aims to showcase the competitive advantages of the Indian toy industry, including its manufacturing capabilities, skilled workforce, technological advancements, and adherence to international quality and safety standards.
An industry official said that this dialogue holds immense significance in further strengthening India's position as a sourcing hub for the global toy industry.
""The meeting would help international companies to explore strategic collaborations and sourcing opportunities with Indian manufacturers. The discussions will also highlight the government's initiatives, including the policy measures introduced by the DPIIT,"" the industry official said.
The government has rolled out measures such as increasing import duty and issuance of mandatory quality norms to boost domestic manufacturing of toys.
These measures have created a conducive environment for sourcing and manufacturing in India, offering attractive incentives, subsidies, and streamlined processes.

Apple is sharpening retail focus in India to shore up revenue,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/apple-is-sharpening-retail-focus-in-india-to-shore-up-revenue/articleshow/101524707.cms,06-07-2023,"Apple
in India is increasing its focus on retail stores to shore up revenue this year.
The company wants to further drive sales from the 200-odd franchisee-owned exclusive retail stores in India by increasing revenue from them and has rolled out its global consumer promotion and discount for students and education fraternity at its two company-owned brick-and-mortar and the online store in India, three industry executives said.
While Apple has been running a student and teacher promotion offer in the Apple authorised resellers and exclusive
premium reseller stores
in India for sometime now, the offers are different in the company-owned stores similar to its global stores.
These strategies indicate the
iPhone
company is seeking double-digit revenue growth in India, they said.
Apple has rolled out a ‘student’ offer in its company-owned stores which includes a discount and freebies on Mac computer and iPad tablets whereby the total deal value is steeper than what is available in the franchise-based Apple Premium Reseller stores, the executives said.

An email sent to Apple India remained unanswered till Wednesday press time.
Industry tracker
Counterpoint Research
said Apple is on target to sell around 9 million iPhones in India this calendar year as compared to 6 million in 2022, despite the smartphone market declining at a record pace. Apple’s revenue grew 16% year-on-year in India in 2022.
Counterpoint’s director of research
Tarun Pathak
said the premium (Rs 30,000-plus) smartphone market – where Apple operates – is growing while the slowdown in sales is largely in the sub-Rs 10,000 segment. The premium segment has doubled to 16% of the overall market by volume in the last 2-3 years, whereas by value, it is now half of the market, he said.

“Apple wants to go aggressive in the run up to the festive season. For the company, its stores, online sites and exclusive outlets are critical channels – to build the end-consumer experience and roping them into the entire ecosystem,” said Pathak.
Apple is now the largest brand in the premium smartphone segment, followed by Samsung.
According to an industry executive, some of the premium resellers recently had a meeting with the Apple team and they suggested ways to increase sales.
“Most of the franchise stores were spread in 800-1,200 square feet. They have been advised to increase the area to 2,000 sq ft wherever it is possible. Similarly, they are advised to focus on redoing the interior and improving the experience of the customer,” he said.

With Apple planning to open more company-owned stores apart from the two in Mumbai and Delhi, franchise stores are looking at ways to provide similar services.
“The SelectCity Walk store in Delhi has become the go to place for buyers of Apple products. Buyer is looking for a better experience which the company-owned store is able to provide. Other stores should also focus on adopting a similar model,” said Shriram PM Monga, who cofounded retail consultancy firm SRED.

No end to retailers' travails even with end of season sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/no-end-to-retailers-travails-even-with-end-of-season-sales/articleshow/101439473.cms,03-07-2023,"Retailers
are concerned over the tepid response to
end of season sales
(EOSS) and are offering discounts of up to 75% amid worries they will need to extend the period as business is yet to reach last year's levels. The next few weeks will be crucial as retailers look to clear out inventory before new-season stock is due to come in.
According to
ICICI Securities
, higher discounts are reflective of the relative stress in underlying inventory. The company analysed
Shoppers Stop
,
Reliance
Trends,
Lifestyle
,
Pantaloons
,
VMART
,
Max
and Westside and found that due to a revenue decline of 5-15% YoY in the April-May period most brands have kicked off EOSS two weeks early, it said in a report released on Sunday.
Retailers traditionally launch EOSS by June end, before fresh season merchandise hits their shelves. However, brands started the sale mid-June and it's likely to continue till mid-July.
As business slowed February onward, brands had been expecting revenue to reach 2022 levels during EOSS, retailers said. Some started the sale early to improve revenue.
""Last year there was a strong momentum leading to EOSS but this year momentum was being built from the second half of May due to the wedding season,"" said Satyen Momaya, CEO of French apparel brand Celio. ""But sales haven't reached the last-year level. During EOSS, it should come to last-year level as we are expecting up to 40% increase.""

Revenue performance in the March quarter had already been weak for most apparel retailers.
""The growth has been slow in comparison to last year but the next two-three weeks are crucial,"" said Lifestyle CEO Devarajan Iyer. ""The task is to liquidate the inventory. Currently, the majority of the brand is on sale, which might increase footfall and sales.""
At the store level, Shoppers Stop is the most aggressive in offering discounts (up to 62%) against peers (25-40%). Discounts offered by Reliance Trends, Lifestyle and Pantaloons were as much as 41%, 39% and 25%, respectively.
Private label retailers such as Westside, Max and VMART continue to follow a strict discounting-window policy and have not participated in the early EOSS.
According to mall operators, brands should go on sale together to push footfall and that will ultimately give a boost to their efforts.
""Retailers in India need to plan the sale on the lines of Dubai--this will create the momentum and will benefit everyone,"" said Muhammad Ali, CEO, Forum Malls of the Bengaluru-based Prestige Group. ""When a customer looking for discounts comes to the mall, he would want every brand on sale. Similarly, there is a separate customer base for fresh stock and for them the sale should end on time.""
While there has been some improvement since May due to the wedding season, the revenue till mid-June is still not at the 2022 level, when pent-up demand had pushed sales to a record high.
The weather has been a key factor.
""Rain during weekends has also played spoilsport in Delhi and Mumbai,"" said Ravinder Choudhary, vice president at Unity Group, which operates over a dozen malls in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Punjab. ""People do not want to go out and get stuck in traffic.""
Several lifestyle, apparel and footwear brands had started mid-season and flash discounting weeks before the usual end of season sales to clear unsold inventory after demand faltered over the past two months.

"Influencers and celebs impact waning, friends may have a bigger influence on Gen Z shopping habits",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/friends-may-have-a-bigger-influence-on-gen-z-when-they-step-out-to-shop/articleshow/101439402.cms,03-07-2023,"India's
Gen Z
are 50% more likely to buy products based on a friend's recommendation than that of an influencer or a celebrity endorsement. This indicates a shift in the perception of content creators and their 'influence' on the demographic cohort that also forms one of the largest audience groups on most social media and content platforms.
In its Not all Gen Z report, Yuvaa--a youth media, insights and impact company--exclusively shared this and other findings with ET on the behaviour and ideologies of the generation born between 1997 and 2012.
According to the report, 71% of Gen Z shoppers from India prefer brands that are environment-friendly, owing to their hyper awareness and concern for climate change, while 63% like to shop from brands that support a social cause. Retail experts note that Gen Zers expect brands to create sustainable products but don't like to pay the additional cost for it.
Close to 77% of Gen Z shoppers are price-conscious buyers, as per the report. This also explains their role in popularising the thrifting culture-the trend of buying used goods, often from a shop that specialises in second-hand products.
Gen Z are the DIY (do it yourself) generation, said
Dhatri Bhatt
, founder of D'Altair Marcom, an integrated marketing agency.

""They like to be unique, inclusive, and socially aware citizens,"" she said. ""They also realise that a large part of what influencers put out is monetised so they can't completely trust them and therefore need a close friend to validate some of their purchases.""
At over 2 billion, Gen Z forms roughly 25% of the global population. It makes up around 35% of India's population, as per
Yuvaa
. The survey of 900 Gen Z participants from about 20 cities across tier 1, 2, and 3 India revealed consumption behaviour and expectations that may have got several brands to redefine products and marketing strategies in recent times.
""You'll notice major apparel brands have a separate Gen Z section that is price sensitive, focuses on latest trends, and has sustainability as a key communication theme,"" said Bhatt, who has worked in the marketing and communication verticals of brands like
Nykaa
Fashion, Christian Dior, and H&M.
In May, Myntra launched FWD, a section on the retail app with weekly trend drops ""to bring Gen Z their latest drip."" That's a Gen Z word for a trendy look or style.
Gen Z is ""the defining voice on fashion and beauty--be it embracing Barbiecore or making everything Insta-worthy, hence they play a big influence in how we are shaping our initiatives,"" said Vijay Sharma, senior director of marketing, Myntra.
The survey findings about trust in friends over influencers for shopping seem to reflect the behaviour of ""networks typically found in more affluent circles, where there is a wider collective exposure to different interests and domains,"" noted Abhimanyu Radhakrishnan, managing director at Qyuki Digital Media, a creator management and monetisation company that runs e-commerce product businesses of a few of its creators like Faisal Shaikh and Madhura Bachal.
""We are seeing that people outside the elite consumer band tend to get most of their expertise-based information for the first time from influencers. They tend to believe influencers because of this notion that their tier 3 and rural towns are cocoons while the real world is out there and the influencer is showing it to them,"" he added. Radhakrishnan pointed out how the rapid rise of finfluencers (finance and trading influencers) hinged on this very phenomenon. ""People from smaller towns were more inclined to trust finfluencers instead of turning to family and friends for advice as they are perceived to be financially illiterate because they bank on fixed deposits, physical gold and other traditional investment avenues.""
Besides shopping, the Yuvaa report also provides insights on the Gen Z thought process in areas such as sex education, mental health and loneliness that aim to dispel certain gender-related stereotypes.
According to the report, 71% of Gen Z men want better safety features on dating apps. Gen Z men, in general, are twice as likely to feel lonely because of their gender than women, the report added.
When it comes to their watchlist, 70% of Gen Z place a good trailer above factors such as cast and marketing to decide whether to watch a movie or show. Gen Z women are 10% more interested in thrillers than in romcoms, the report further said.

Govt asks ecommerce companies to refrain from using dark patterns for duping consumers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/govt-asks-ecommerce-companies-to-refrain-from-using-dark-patterns/articleshow/101403727.cms,01-07-2023,"The Ministry of Consumer Affairs (MCA) has written a letter to top digital commerce companies such as
Amazon
,
Flipkart
,
Nykaa
, BigBasket,
Reliance
Retail, Swiggy, Meesho among others to stop using
dark patterns
for duping consumers as it is an unfair trading practice.
The ministry is also in the process of framing guidelines for discouraging the usage of dark patterns, said Rohit Kumar Singh, secretary, department of consumer affairs which comes under the ministry of consumer affairs.
The department has urged the industry to self-regulate and establish ethical design guidelines to rectify the menace, failing which the offense will be punishable as unfair trade practices.
Dark patterns involve using a design and choice architecture to trick, coerce or influence consumers to make choices not in their best interest.
""Engaging in such deceptive and manipulative conduct by using dark patterns in online interfaces unfairly exploits consumers' interest and constitutes 'unfair trade practice' under the Consumer Protection Act, (2019),"" the secretary said in a letter to the industry written on June 28.
Live Events
""Therefore I strongly urge you to refrain from indulging in any design or pattern in the online interface of your platform that may deceive or manipulate consumer choice and fall in the category of dark pattern,"" the letter further said.
Dark Patterns are interfaces crafted to trick or manipulate users into making choices that are detrimental to their interest.
The ministry has identified 10 practices which fall under dark patterns such as creating false urgency, sneaking items into the final purchase basket, confirm shaming that is shaming consumers for not paying extra money for charity, forced action such as forceful signing up, nagging, subscription traps, interface trap such as making it difficult to exit a page, bait and switch meaning advertising one product but sending another, hidden costs and disguised advertising.
In recent years India has experienced a boom in internet and smartphone penetration with the number of active internet users in 2022 touching 759 million. This is expected to increase to 900 Mmllion by 2025.
With this India's consumer digital economy is also expected to become a $1 trillion market by 2030, growing from $537.5 billion in 2020. This is driven by the strong adoption of online services, making it important for the government to safeguard consumer interest.

Uniqlo plans major manufacturing presence in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/uniqlo-plans-major-manufacturing-presence-in-india/articleshow/101354863.cms,29-06-2023,"Fast Retailing, the parent company of
Uniqlo
, is looking to set up a significant
manufacturing presence
in
India
through about 20 ‘production partners’, multiple people aware of the development told ET.
One of the world's most valuable clothing retailers, Uniqlo already has a cluster of production partners in India and is looking to expand this network through a significantly large investment, they said without sharing any estimated amount.
“The investment amount will be significant because Uniqlo is serious about India and views it as an important market,” one of the persons said. “Unlike the existing facilities in India, which cater more towards exports, the production partners that Uniqlo will bring to India will be specifically meant for the domestic market.”
One of the company's production partners that ET spoke to confirmed that their current mandate is to produce only for exports.
Uniqlo, which is Asia's biggest clothing brand, had said India is one of the top priority markets for them where consumers are increasingly shifting from ‘fast-fashion’ to long-lasting essentials and functional wear.

The company’s ambitions for India are considerable with its CEO Tadashi Yanai indicating that he wants Uniqlo to become the “best-selling retailer in India”.
The Japanese brand opened its first door in September 2019, but stringent lockdown measures announced to contain the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 delayed the expansion plan.
The brand is now planning to enter Mumbai and Bangalore. It has already opened stores in Lucknow and Chandigarh after Delhi.
Uniqlo does not own any factories. Instead, it outsources production of almost all its products to factories outside Japan.
As per a report titled ‘The Uniqlo case: fast retailing recipe for attaining market leadership position in casual clothing’, this model allows Uniqlo to keep its breakeven point low and improve return on investment.
“As we expand our global sales, we continue to grow our partner factory network in countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and India,” the company has stated on its website.
As per its list of garment factories, as on March 1, 2023, Uniqlo has 227 factories in China, 54 in Vietnam, 33 in Bangladesh, 13 in Indonesia, and 16 factories in India and Japan among several other locations.
As the world’s second most-populated country, India is an attractive market for apparel brands, especially with youngsters increasingly embracing western-style clothing.
Over the past decade, global brands Zara and H&M became market leaders in the fast fashion segment in India.
“For global brands, India should be one of the most logical sourcing hubs given its large vertically integrated manufacturing sector on the one hand and the large, growing domestic market driving demand on the other hand,” Devangshu Dutta, founder of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight, told ET. “However, its weight in the sourcing baskets has historically been low due to several reasons, in spite of China being visible for decades to the management teams of brands and retailers as a concentrated sourcing risk,” he said.
Uniqlo’s existing production partners in the country include Shahi Exports, Brandix Lanka,
Tangerine Design
,
Maral Overseas
, Shingora Textiles, Silver Spark Apparel, SM Lulla Industries Worldwide and Penguin Apparels.
As per Fast Retailing's first-half results, the company said its revenue was 1.4672 trillion yen, or around $10.2 billion, and that its operating profit had risen to 220.2 billion yen ($1.53 billion), bolstered by strong performances from operations in several regions, including India where it said it generated significant increases in both revenue and profit.
With regard to
Uniqlo International
, in particular, it said revenue stood at 755.2 billion yen ($5.25 billion), while operating profit was 122.6 billion yen ($852.93 million).
The company said regions like India “reported significant revenue and profit gains as they enter a full-fledged growth phase”.

Market size of India's online retail sector likely to touch $325 billion by 2030: Deloitte India report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/market-size-of-indias-online-retail-sector-likely-to-touch-325-billion-by-2030-deloitte-india-report/articleshow/101308430.cms,27-06-2023,"The country's
online retail
market size may touch USD 325 billion by 2030 against USD 70 billion in 2022, mainly due to rapid growth of e-commerce in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, according to a
Deloitte India
report released on Tuesday. It also said that online retail penetration is projected to grow at an extraordinary rate, and it would outpace offline retail by 2.5 times in the next decade.
As India ascends to become the world's third-largest consumer market, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP's (Deloitte India's) 'Future of Retail' report ""foresees the online
retail sector
, which stood at USD 70 billion in 2022, to surge to USD 325 billion by 2030"".
The report attributes these projections to the rapid growth of e-commerce in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, which have surpassed tier-1 markets in terms of total orders.
In 2022, these cities accounted for over 60 per cent of all orders, with tier-3 cities experiencing a remarkable 65 per cent growth in order volume and tier-2 cities witnessing a substantial 50 per cent growth, it said.
""The surge in online retail can be attributed to various factors. The convenience of ordering and returns, bolstered by a robust logistics infrastructure spanning over 19,000 pin codes, has played a pivotal role,"" it added.

Boston
Consulting Group report, and the value of digital payments is expected to more than triple from $3 trillion to $10 trillion by 2026.
""We navigated the storms and made your company stronger, much more agile and nimble and future fit both from the perspective of portfolio and capabilities. Over the ten year period, returns to you have surpassed both the market index as well as the FMCG index. I am a big believer in the India story.

The country's biggest consumer products firm said the manufacturing industry witnessed multiple challenges like shrinking margins, inflation in raw material costs and supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, coupled with geopolitical tensions.
""Resilient supply chains were the need of the hour, and this provided an opportunity for India.

Retail Ltd
– which owns the
Croma
chain of electronic stores and is the group’s arm for online sales of mobile phones and electronic products – nearly doubled its sales to Rs 16,015 crore in 2022-23, as per latest filings to the Registrar of Companies (RoC).
However, the business continues to bleed with net losses also more than doubling to Rs 957 crore (Rs 445 crore in FY22), the filings show.
The company in the filings did not give any reasons behind the financial performance. Industry executives said this jump in revenue – highest growth rate in at least the last five years – is driven by Croma becoming the exclusive online seller for all electronic products in the group’s e-commerce platform
Tata Neu
and rapid offline store expansion. They said Croma has also been burning money to discount products to gain larger share from rivals like
Reliance Digital
,
Amazon
and Walmart-owned Flipkart.
Infiniti Retail in the filings said the same store growth – a critical parameter for offline retail success – went up by 44% in the year under review, while online sales grew four times. It said
Tata
Neu contributed 72% of all online sales last fiscal. Infiniti also opened its highest number of new offline stores last year – 113.
“FY 2022-23 was a year where the company was able to fully capitalize on the completely recovered demand, post the Covid restrictions and supply chain disruptions of the previous year. Despite the global market slowdown, the electronics market in India grew steadily at 36% (offline) though due to looming inflation, the market is expected to go soft at 11% growth next year (2023-24),” the company said in the filings.

ToI said citing a statement by a metro official: ""It will provide the users the convenience of shopping for groceries and other essential items at the metro stations while waiting for the train. Selected brands will display their products and services on the app through extended reality tools, and travellers can simply use a QR code mechanism to shop for the goods of their choice. The immersive and dynamic content at these virtual stores will bridge the gap between digital and real-life shopping.""
On the app, users can also access additional features such as instant recharge of Metro's smart cards and smart payment, including insurance, electricity, gas payments and FASTag, the report said.
Users will also get detailed information on the app about facilities available at stations, ToI reported. These include location and condition of gates, lifts, escalators, platforms, train timings, occupancy of coaches and space availability. Real-time information on train arrival time and exit gates will also be available, it said.

The Case for “For All Leadership”,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/the-case-for-for-all-leadership/articleshow/101058369.cms,17-06-2023,"Insights from India’s Best Companies to Work For 2023
Backed by 30 years of data, Great Place To Work® is the global authority on workplace culture. Great Place To Work’s methodology, derived from years of studying the Best Workplaces across the globe, is recognized as a rigorous, objective and is considered the gold standard for defining great workplaces across business, academia, and government organizations. The proprietary methodology and platform enable leaders to truly capture, analyze and understand the experience of every employee and compare outcomes with data collected from more than 100 million employees in 150 countries worldwide.
The 16th edition of Great Place To Work India’s study of India’s Best Companies to Work For 2023, reinforces the need for every leader to be a For All™ leader. Enabling employees to maximize their potential must be the focus for organizations, especially during a high growth phase of the Indian economy.
""Click
here
to view India's Best Workplaces of 2023""
What do the Best Workplaces do differently?
The Best Workplaces have shown an impact around equity – both in fair gain sharing and compensation, along with building a nurturing work environment. When experienced positively, these aspects result in people being 5 times or more likely to believe that their organization is a great workplace.
Best Workplaces result in Higher Shareholders Returns.
Financial growth is one of the most visible outcomes of building a great workplace culture. A study of shareholder returns of the publicly listed Best Workplaces identified by Great Place To Work India shows a positive correlation with returns provided to shareholders.
RSM India’s study reveals that Best Workplaces consistently outperform major stock indices, such as BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) Sensex 30 and Nifty 50, by more than 3x and have yielded 14x returns on the initial investment in Reinvestment Model and 10x returns on the initial investments through Hold Model.
With For All Leadership, work takes a special significance
In today’s rapidly evolving world, priorities are shifting. Purpose has taken the lead. Sustainability is no longer optional; it is necessary. Belonging emerges as the driving force for progress, and flexibility is a default expectation.
These facets are transforming how we lead, how we operate, and how we thrive. To navigate this new paradigm developing For All Leadership is the answer. With For All leaders, everyone consistently experiences a great workplace.
From an Unintentional Leader (Level 1) to a For All leader (Level 5), 56% more employees experience special meaning in their job, 44% more feel an increased sense of contribution to society, 78% more can be themselves at work, and 71% more respond to being able to take time off when necessary.
You might be a For All Leader if you . . .
Workplaces that work for everyone
At Great Place to Work India, we believe in a future where leaders and employees transcend biases, where workplaces embody equity and foster a better work environment, and where people leaders stand as advocates of For All Leadership.
Being a For All Leader is a challenging role. To excel, leaders should create a positive work environment, foster cooperation and trust among team members. In addition, they should encourage fairness, ensure their actions match their words, demonstrate competence in running the business, and show sincere interest in employees. Setting these aspects as priorities will enable leaders to foster an environment where individuals and the organization can thrive.
By embracing these principles, we look forward to making India a Great Place to Work For All, where everyone, regardless of who they are and what they do, consistently experiences a Great Workplace.

Premium beauty products’ demand to outpace mass segment: Nykaa,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/premium-beauty-products-demand-to-outpace-mass-segment-nykaa/articleshow/101052742.cms,17-06-2023,"The share of the premium segment of
beauty and personal care
(BPC) products will grow to an estimated 55% of the total BPC market in the country by 2026 from 45% at present, with a corresponding decrease in the share of the mass segment to 45% from 55% now, omnichannel beauty and
fashion retailer
Nykaa said in its annual investor day presentation to analysts on Friday.
The Mumbai-based company said consumer preference in the BPC category is shifting from personal care to beauty products, as a result of growth in per capita gross domestic product (
GDP
).
Nykaa also said that it has recorded $80 (about Rs 6,500) per customer spend in the BPC category in the past 12 months, which is significantly higher than the $15 per capita (about Rs 1,200) spend on BPC in India. It estimated that the national per capita spend on BPC would grow to $50 (Rs 4,100 at current exchange rates) by 2030.
During the company’s March quarter earnings call last month, Nykaa’s chief executive of e-retail
Anchit Nayar
had said that one of the key focus areas for the company was “acquiring new customers and equally importantly retaining the existing loyal, premium repeat customers”. While Nykaa’s BPC category saw the gross merchandise value grow 32% year-on-year during 2022-23 to Rs 6,649 crore, the average order value (at maximum retail price) for the category stagnated at Rs 1,857.
It said in the presentation that per capita spend on BPC category also varied according to income groups.

An email seeking comment from Reliance Retail remained unanswered till press time Monday.
Leading actress Kareena Kapoor Khan endorses some of India's biggest brands.
Suhana Khan, 22, is set to make her Bollywood debut this year. This will be Khan’s second major brand endorsement deal, the first being of premium cosmetics brand Maybelline in April this year. Advani, on the other hand, too has endorsed dozens of brands including HUL’s Pond’s, Slice mango drink, fashion ecommerce platform Myntra and Senco diamonds, among others.
The beauty and personal care market, valued at $26.3 billion in 2022, is forecast to touch $38 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 6.45 per cent between 2023 and 2028, amid a beauty boom in India fuelled by aspirational demand, social media and marketing push by companies, according to research company IMARC. In addition, multiple factors including increase in discretionary spending and higher number of high-street stores are pushing demand in the beauty market.
Nykaa opened 45 physical stores in 2022, taking its total store count to about 150, and despite higher losses on account of new store openings, plans to open about 50 offline stores this year.
Shoppers Stop
too has said it is setting up over a dozen SS Beauty stand-alone stores this year.
Other brands such as Sugar, The Body Shop, Lotus Herbals, Revlon, and Plum have either invested in store expansion or stepped up online presence. Many companies are investing in expansion and digital presence.
Sugar Cosmetics-owned Sugar Pop make-up brand had announced actress Shehnaaz Gill as its first brand ambassador last week.
Retailers are investing heavily in stores, with services such as hiring beauty advisors with specialised skill sets to offer consumers with make-up application techniques, knowledge about skin types, virtual try-on tools and personalised recommendations.
A report by Avendus pegged the overall beauty and personal care market to reach Rs 2.2 lakh crore by 2025, growing four times higher from last year.

, India’s largest online
non-grocery retail
aggregator, has expanded offline by opening its first store in
Mumbai
. The company plans to open 50 stores by the end of this year in
UP
,
Maharashtra
,
Gujarat
and
Delhi
where it will transform and standardize the existing small retail shops selling unbranded merchandise which are already part of CoutLoot’s platform
With each store measuring between 200-1000 sq ft, CoutLoot aims to replicate the success of Oyo in the hospitality industry, by providing these small retailers with the infrastructure and technology required to scale their businesses.
Jasmeet Thind, Cofounder of CoutLoot said, “ This move is aimed at making at creating a large scale impact both offline and online helping partner seller stores source better, sell faster, and market wider, ultimately growing into bigger scale businesses at the same time serving India’s mass consumer segment. With access to CoutLoot's tech and data, these stores are expected to increase their sales by two times in the first year itself due to better way of sourcing and wider channels of selling”
The existing small retailers currently generate between Rs70,000 to 5 lakh per month in sales. By partnering with CoutLoot, they will have access to a wider customer base, increased sales, and improved efficiencies in their operations.
CoutLoot's decision to transform existing stores into branded outlets is part of its larger vision to provide end-to-end services to its partner network of stores creating a vertical technology company in the non grocery retail space. The company aims to provide services at each layer of the business through technology, ultimately creating a more seamless and connected ecosystem for retailers and customers alike.

End of season sale begins early as retailers clear stock,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/end-of-season-sale-begins-early-as-retailers-clear-stock/articleshow/100921038.cms,12-06-2023,"Several lifestyle, apparel and footwear brands have started mid-season and flash discounting, weeks before the usual end of season sales (EOSS) to clear unsold inventory after demand faltered over the past two months.

Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
Historically, retailers launch EOSS by June end before fresh season merchandise hits their shelves. However, brands have now either started cutting prices or will initiate a
sale
period in the coming week.
""Based on the sales done in previous year, many retailers stocked items expecting similar momentum,"" said Lalit Agarwal, chairman of hypermarket chain V-Mart. ""But February onwards has been tough for the industry. Despite May showing some improvement, retailers have started discounting earlier than the normal schedule. For us, we had increased prices which impacted demand so we reduced the prices.""
Despite
inflation
, consumers flocked to shops for discretionary products last year, helping the market rebound strongly post pandemic. However, the market reached a point of spending exhaustion over the past few months when even premium products saw lower growth rates. The overall growth slowed down to 6% in both March and April, according to the Retailers Association of India, indicating the slowest sales expansion in more than 14 months.
""There has been a slowdown in the overall market and brands would ideally want to exhaust their current inventory before the fresh stock comes in July,"" said Devarajan Iyer, CEO of fashion retailer Lifestyle.

Listed apparel retailers witnessed a 20%-30% top-line growth during the March quarter, aided by a favourable base. While formats catering to low-income consumers such as V-Mart and Pantaloons continued to be under pressure,
Page Industries
and
Aditya Birla Fashion
& Retail said there are early signs of a demand slowdown in the premium end as well.
""Our overall growth rate this quarter has got affected significantly across our segments. It has also resulted in higher inventory and higher debt,"" said Ashish Dikshit, managing director, ABFRL. ""This is probably the first full quarter where the impact of slowdown is fully visible across all segments of our business. I had earlier referred to the lower end of the market being more affected but now, it appears that it is a more widespread sort of slowdown in this period.""
Malls said discounting is also segment specific in some cases. For instance, retailers will have to implement quality control, including establishing testing laboratories and getting BIS licences among others by next month.
""Footwear retailers also want to clear inventory before the mandatory requirement of BIS,"" said Ravinder Choudhary, vice-president at Unity Group that operates over a dozen malls in NCR and Punjab. ""Retailers have also advanced their sales to compete with online retailers that are already offering discounting ahead of their mega sale.""

Myntra introduces Myntra Minis: Video platform to enable discovery of fashion & beauty trends and launches,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/myntra-introduces-myntra-minis-video-platform-to-enable-discovery-of-fashion-beauty-trends-and-launches/articleshow/100846015.cms,08-06-2023,"Fashion
e-commerce platform
Myntra
has introduced Myntra Minis, a short-form video platform, as a part of the 18th edition of its Marquee Fashion Festival which is the end of season sale, a company release said on Thursday.
This feature is available to more than 70% of Myntra's existing users on the company's home page, beauty page and Myntra Studio. There is a plan to add this feature to all category pages, the company said.
The new feature is inspired by the popular format of small videos used by
social media
platforms to highlight products across categories, new launches, and global trends, the press release stated. The length of such videos is usually one minute.
80 percent of the existing videos are under one minute in duration, with over 10 percent aimed to be within the 2 to 3-minute mark. The overall length and format of each video depends on the type and number of products highlighted.

Each video, made using popular creators, comes with an integrated product tray that customers can interact with and browse for a particular product that they can later purchase from the same page, without any further assistance. Almost every product category across Myntra is eligible for this feature.
On the launch of Myntra Minis, Arun Devanathan, Senior Director of Social Commerce, Myntra, said, “We are excited to launch Myntra Minis, an industry-first feature that combines the engagement of short-form content with the convenience of inspiration-led instant shopping. As we go deeper in building for our thriving base of young, trend-first shoppers, snackable videos that help them in their discovery of trends and brands felt like a fitting feature to introduce, especially as it gains popularity as a preferred content consumption medium. Myntra Minis is poised to revolutionize the way you delve into the world of fashion and beauty, enabling you to create exceptional, on-trend looks that reflect your individualistic sense of style.”
The presence of short-form video content on social media has disrupted the way fashion, beauty and lifestyle content is consumed across the globe. Myntra Minis will bridge this gap by using visuals and content, the company said.
Myntra will aim for the majority of brands on the platform to use the feature to share content that will make their products more accessible to customers, it said. So far, more than 5000 videos have been uploaded, with 1000 of those being directly created by the brands themselves.
Myntra expects Myntra Minis to gain immense popularity among millennials and Gen-Z in tier-2 and 3 towns, in addition to larger metropolitan areas.
Myntra is one of India's leading platforms for fashion brands. It is an integral part of the Flipkart Group.

premiumisation
has become a big consumer trend in India. But, counter-intuitively, these premium products are witnessing a demand surge in small towns, Tier-3 and Tier-4, instead of metros where expensive items have found markets traditionally.
Consumer companies across categories, such as
Nestle
, Domino's, McDonald's and Lotus Herbals have cited higher traction for premium products in tier-2, -3 and even tier-4 markets, leading much of the post-pandemic revival, adding this is happening despite inflation.
The pandemic has left a clear split running down the middle of India's consumer demand. While those at the lower income levels are still reluctantly opening their purse strings after the pandemic ravaged the economy, the rich are splurging on luxury items. And a large number of these rich spenders are in small towns.
Retailers hit the small towns
Prompted by the trend, retailers are expanding faster in tier-2 and -3 markets than metros as aspirational demand, ease of digital payments and social media fuel this growth, executives have told ET.

""The contribution of top 10 cities has declined 4-5% and gone in favour of Tier 3, 4 cities - that long-term trend is indisputable and every retailer has to pay attention to these markets,"" Ashok Sonthalia, chief financial officer of Tata Group-backed
Titan Company
, has told ET. Titan sells watches under the Titan and Fastrack labels besides jewellery brands Tanishq, CaratLane and Mia, along with Skinn perfumes and Taneira sarees.
Brands such as
Shoppers Stop

Soch, another ethnic wear brand, has opened stores in cities like Kurnool, Muzaffarpur, Gorakhpur and Jaipur. It plans to start outlets in Udupi, Dehradun, Allahabad, Madurai, Ludhiana, Barnala, Faridabad, Jodhpur, Vellore and Thrissur, ET has reported
Why are small-towners buying premium products?
Premium goods market is growing in small towns due to aspirational buying, which is triggered by the internet and social media. The spread of the internet, e-commerce and digital payments has flattened the premium market. Gone are the days when small-town cousins would come to metros for shopping. Now they can order online if there isn't a retail outlet in town.
In fact, more than 60% of the online shoppers in India are from small towns, according to a study by Bain & Company.
ET Online
Metrics pertain to CY 2022; 2. Metrics pertain to CY 2021. 3. Smaller towns refers to towns outside the top 100 cities by population.
The Indian ecommerce market is expected to reach? 9 lakh crore by FY26, with customers from tier-2 and smaller cities driving most of the growth, consulting firm Redseer said in a report on Tuesday, released in collaboration with Plural by Pine Labs, a digital payments firm.
Online shoppers are expected to grow by 50% in the coming three years to reach 300 million by FY26, Redseer partner Jasbir Juneja said in the report.
The Bain & Company report says digital consumers in small towns are just as savvy as those in metros.
ET Online
Based on monthly average spends; 2. Based on average order value; 3. Based on average spend on the platform in the last 12 months.
Online shopping is flattening the retail market with consumers in small towns preferring to buy premium items online which may not be available otherwise locally. More than 55% of small-town residents preferred online shopping for gifts, clothing, footwear and electronics, according to a recent survey by CBRE India. The number is just slightly lower than for metros.
Small towns are emerging as centres of wealth creation with an increasing number of rupee billionaires. Craze for foreign education and travel and luxury products are emerging trends in small towns. The small-towns middle class too has more purchasing power with better education opportunities and resultant employment prospects. 54% of employers expect to hire candidates from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, which highlights the rising availability of diverse talent in these cities, according to a Randstad India report.

Here’s how shopkeepers can get financing for their shops,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/heres-how-shopkeepers-can-get-financing-for-their-shops/articleshow/100809994.cms,07-06-2023,"1 Click Capital, powered by CHP Finance Private Limited, made history as it became India’s first NBFC to provide unsecured payroll funding in the lending market.

Let’s decode the challenges, struggles and relentless efforts that propelled Sachin from a budding entrepreneur to the visionary founder of 1 Click Capital.
After the success of payroll funding,
Sachin Malik

High competition, limited access to capital, technological limitations, customer loyalty issues, and the inability to scale their business, due to lack of funds for expansion or for hiring new employees, are some of the major challenges faced by small business owners. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative strategies and resourceful solutions to thrive in a highly competitive market.
1 Click Capital: A possible solution
1 Click Retail is offering unsecured short-term financing starting at 50,000 to 5 lakh. 1 Click Capital’s shopkeeper financing is a financial tool that can help shopkeepers in Mumbai overcome the challenges they face. It allows shopkeepers to access capital, which means that they can buy inventory and supplies at the right time. This capital will help every shopkeeper solve their day-to-day financial needs. This will also help them improve their technology, which will allow them to compete with online retailers.

"Pandemic boom over, D2C brands now switching to offline channels: Tata Consumer MD",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/pandemic-boom-over-d2c-brands-now-switching-to-offline-channels-tata-consumer-md/articleshow/100802246.cms,07-06-2023,"Tata Consumer
, which sells packaged groceries from salt and staples to water and tea, said direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands that thrived during the pandemic were now fading away, which reflects in these online-only brands shifting focus to local kirana stores, where established firms have a significant clout.
“The hype of D2C, which was there during the pandemic, is starting to taper off a bit and that is also one of the reasons why many of the players are now starting to come into the offline world,”
Sunil D'Souza
, managing director at Tata Consumer, told ET. “Distribution in general trade in India is not as simple as just putting a product out there and moving along. Companies have spent years building on their distribution systems and these are sources of competitive advantage for the large players.”
D2C brands
refer to businesses that have most of their revenue or customer acquisition from direct-to-consumer online channels or those started with an online-first distribution before going omnichannel.
From predominantly selling tea, coffee and salt a few years ago, Tata Consumer expanded into pulses, spices, ready to cook, drink product categories and more recently, snacking products. The company also accelerated the pace of innovation last fiscal, launching 34 products compared with 19 in FY22.

However, several of these newage categories also saw increased proliferation of online-only brands, which innovated products to address niche whitespaces, leveraging consumer data and insights.
Nearly two years ago, Tata Consumer acquired a 100% stake in Kottaram Agro Foods, the maker of Soulfull brand of breakfast cereals and millet-based snacks. Even rivals Marico,
ITC
and
HUL
have been investing in D2C brands. For instance,
Marico
picked up a 54% stake in HW Wellness Solutions, which owns healthy breakfast and snacks brand True Elements. ITC invested in Sproutlife Foods (SFPL), which makes Yoga Bar, while
Hindustan Unilever
Limited (HUL) invested in Zywie Ventures, which sells plant-based supplement brand Oziva, and Nutritionalab, which owns nutritional products under Wellbeing.
The maker of Tata Sampann, Tata Salt and Tata Tea Gold remains unperturbed. ""We remain focused on continuing to strengthen this competitive advantage, while at the same time building on our muscles into the D2C space so that we will also continue to take advantage of that shopping behaviour,” D'Souza said.

Premiumisation wave sweeps across India's small towns,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/premiumisation-wave-sweeps-across-indias-small-towns/articleshow/100802174.cms,07-06-2023,"Small towns are driving the growth of premium categories such as fashion, packaged foods, cosmetics, eating out and lifestyle accessories amid a steady revival of consumer demand. Prompted by the trend, retailers are expanding faster in tier-2 and -3 markets than metros as aspirational demand, ease of
digital payments
and social media fuel this growth, executives said.
""The contribution of top 10 cities has declined 4-5% and gone in favour of tier 3, 4 cities - that long-term trend is indisputable and every retailer has to pay attention to these markets,"" said Ashok
Sonthalia
, chief financial officer of Tata Group-backed
Titan Company
, which sells watches under the Titan and Fastrack labels besides jewellery brands Tanishq, CaratLane and Mia, along with Skinn perfumes and Taneira sarees.
Consumers everywhere have access to what's happening, thanks to platforms such as Instagram and YouTube, with ecommerce ensuring delivery to the smaller markets, he said.
""Hence, we are seeing this happening across our fragrances, watches, sarees, bags and jewellery lines,"" Sonthalia said.

The Indian ecommerce market is expected to reach ₹9 lakh crore by FY26, with customers from tier-2 and smaller cities driving most of the growth, consulting firm Redseer said in a report on Tuesday, released in collaboration with Plural by Pine Labs, a digital payments firm.
""From bustling cities to remote villages, digital payments are on the fast track to change the way users transact,"" the Redseer report said. ""Penetration of smartphones and the internet, and favourable government policies have been key drivers in the adoption of digital payments.""
Online shoppers are expected to grow by 50% in the coming three years to reach 300 million by FY26, Redseer partner Jasbir Juneja said in the report.
Consumer companies across categories, such as
Nestle
, Domino's, McDonald's and
Lotus Herbals
have cited higher traction for premium products in tier-2, -3 and even tier-4 markets, leading much of the post-pandemic revival, adding this is happening despite inflation.
Nestle India
chairman Suresh Narayanan said in a recent interview with ET: ""We are surprised that some of our premium packs of coffee and chocolates are seeing a surge in demand from the really small towns. Distributors too are asking us for stocks... and such markets are serviceable now. Earlier, many of these markets had no roads.""
Brands such as
Shoppers Stop
, Meena Bazaar, Soch, Mohanlal Sons and Tasva have planned the highest number of stores in a year to cater to the demand surge, especially in tier 2 cities, executives from these companies said.
""We have planned to open at least one store every month and most of it is in tier-2, -3 cities and we are confident of these stores doing well,"" said Sameer Manglani, owner of Meena Bazaar.
Soch, another ethnic wear brand, has opened stores in cities like Kurnool, Muzaffarpur, Gorakhpur and Jaipur. It plans to start outlets in Udupi, Dehradun, Allahabad,
Madurai
, Ludhiana, Barnala, Faridabad, Jodhpur, Vellore and Thrissur.
Of the 11 department stores opened by Shoppers Stop in the last financial year, only three are in metro cities.

"Amazon India pays a fitting emotional homage to its loyal customers, dedicated employees, persistent delivery partners, & ardent sellers on its 10th anniversary",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazon-india-pays-a-fitting-emotional-homage-to-its-loyal-customers-dedicated-employees-persistent-delivery-partners-ardent-sellers-on-its-10th-anniversary/articleshow/100760148.cms,13-06-2023,"When a commemorative milestone is reached in a journey, it's always lovely to look back with gratitude. Gratitude sweetens the experience and readies one for the future. Appreciating the support and contributions of people who get you to the top, makes it easier to pave a strong path ahead and achieve more milestones.
On its 10th anniversary, Amazon India is expressing gratitude for making it this far with the love and support of people that made
#IndiaKiApniDukaan.
Amazon is thankful to every trusting customer, ardent seller, diligent delivery agent, devoted employee, skilled artisan, thriving small and medium business, and each invaluable partner that made its decade-long journey more than memorable.
This heartfelt video perfectly sums up the gratitude Amazon feels towards people who made #IndiaKiApniDukaan their go-to online shop.
With top-notch technology and a determined supply chain, Amazon India can truly make every customer's wish come true. Be it an Indian sitting in Madurai craving for Agra's petha or someone from Bhavnagar wanting Bengal's luscious rasgullas, their click is #IndiaKiApniDukaan's command. Amazon India’s relentless delivery agents see to it that the package reaches its right address in any circumstance. Be it extreme weather or difficult roads, these delivery agents battle everything to take the box towards its rightful owners.
What started as mere 100 sellers back in 2013, today the seller community has grown to massive 12 lakhs! Over 1 lakh Indian sellers are also taking their products overseas through Amazon. The sellers are always working in tandem with the supply chain management to ensure the product reaches the customers on time and that the quality is never compromised. This dedication has made Amazon strong enough to cater to millions of customers who are happy and satisfied with their timely services.
Live Events
#IndiaKiApniDukaan
solved the language barrier too. It was when customers filled the search bar with queries for products in their language (such as silbatta, khulkhula etc), it was time for Amazon to serve customers in their native language. Today, customers can order anything from #IndiaKiApniDukaan without searching and translating a thing they are looking for.
Amazon #IndiaKiApniDukaan always strives to bring ease of technology and user experience to satisfy every Indian's need. Today, a 20-year-old granddaughter teaches her 80-year-old
thatha
how to order a shawl on Amazon. The fact that GenZ can teach the older generation how to embrace technology with Amazon India is a delightful reminder of the beautiful harmony that exists in the new Bharat, where advanced technology gracefully intertwines with deep-rooted traditions and values. The sight of an 80-year-old learning to shop online with a 20-year-old with such nonchalance is truly a heart-warming experience.
A lot happened in Amazon India's decade-long journey. As the video rightly resonates – Over ten years,
#IndiaKiApniDukaan
achieved a milestone, and it was only possible due to their customers, delivery agents, sellers and supply chain personnel. With love, dedication and respect towards their work of serving customers, Amazon completes 10 years with gratitude in its heart. However, with the determination to perform better, the brand is only getting started and today, it’s just day one at Amazon India! On Amazon India's 10th anniversary, here's wishing #IndiaKiApniDukaan onwards and upwards.

Tata Digital sets sights on revenue growth after reworking its app,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tata-digital-sets-sights-on-revenue-growth-after-reworking-its-app/articleshow/100749274.cms,30-06-2023,"Tata Sons
has invested more than $2 billion in super app
Tata Neu
, which has seen a surge in business after being reworked in time for the just-concluded Indian
Premier
League (IPL),
Tata Digital
CEO Pratik Pal told ET in an interview. He added that the company is looking at turning profitable in a three-to-five-year timeframe.
The app, which completed a year on April 7, was given a new design as well as improved navigation and payment systems, resulting in its best growth phase on all counts, including revenue, said Pal, who was appointed Tata Digital CEO in 2019. He was with
TCS
before that for more than 27 years in leadership positions.
""The app had over one million seconds of on-screen visibility through on-ground branding and around 110 million campaign reach with 13 million installs and 75 million visits during the IPL,"" Pal said in his first interview as Tata Digital CEO. ""We have reached 75 million NeuPass members and 60 million cumulative installs. Almost 60% of our customers are repeat customers while multi-category customers have increased from less than 10% a year ago to over 25%."" Tata Digital, the wholly-owned ecommerce subsidiary of Tata Sons, is now working on offering a wider portfolio of products, including those that the Tata Group may not be present in, to meet consumer demands.
""End-to-end consumer experiences matter and that is a big road map for us,"" he said. ""Our omnichannel experience has to be the best in class because of our assets and consumer touchpoints. We are now working on a road map to widen our omnichannel platform and offer more consumer choices by adding new products and categories that the Tata universe may not have.""
Immediately after the official launch last year, the company had to go back to the drawing board to address complaints about glitches, poor user experience and payment issues. ""We worked during the last eight months on making the app experience best in class... and we expanded consumer offerings and launched multiple financial services,"" Pal said. ""Consumers have reacted positively to the new version with a rating of 4.2 and all the app parameters are currently at par with industry benchmarks. We... have drawn a strong road map towards innovating on customer experience."" The app was launched with three broad categories - electronics, grocery and e-pharmacy. Air Asia and
Indian Hotels
then came on board, followed by Titan, Tanishq and Westside. On financial services side, Tata Neu
HDFC
card was launched in November with the loyalty programmes of Titan, Tanishq and Westside folded into the NeuPass. The app also allows Unified Payments Interface transactions and bill payments besides offering loans and insurance.

Its flagship firm Future Retail Ltd and logistics and infra arm Future Enterprises are already facing insolvency proceedings.

firms joining the network.
Excerpts:
How has ONDC scaled up?
We are in over 240-odd cities today with 47 network participants. Out of which seven are logistics, 12 are buyers and remaining are seller apps. In first week of January, we saw about 50 daily transactions in the food and grocery space. Currently, that has scaled up to 10,000-20,000 daily transactions.
Live Events
What about other categories that have been added. How are the volumes?
We have started enabling other domains like fashion and electronics. Volumes in these categories should start picking up in the next few months as more merchants come onto the network. Many early adopters like Snapdeal, Boat and Sangeetha Mobiles are already on board. We expect more sellers to join in the coming days because they are seeing the benefits. In the existing platform-centric model, the platform dictates what kind ofschemes to run.
But in ONDC, control shifts to the end-points like merchants, who give them option to present their own terms and conditions. We plan to have financial products on the network in three to four months.
How long can discounts be sustained?
I do not think this network can scale up on discounts. The strategy used by any ecommerce player has been to build a captive user base with a variety of incentives,so that they can have a control on the market, on the sellers and their margins.
On the other hand, ONDC’s approach is to use incentives as a trigger to jump-start the network with trial orders. While network participants may have their own offers and schemes, ONDC offers are being carefully curated to encourage wider participation and trials from a broad range of merchants. Specified upper caps have been put in place to prevent concentration of these offers among a few merchants and products. The discounts and incentives will continue only for a few months.
What is the long-term growth strategy?
With ONDC, sellers need not be married to any one platform. Different kind of platforms will join the network, bringing different kind of sellers. This will pave way for specialisation and innovation, which will drive efficiencies and supply chains’ cost structures will eventually come down. Merchants are feeling a certain sense of liberation. They have access to their own consumer data. Most of the merchants and brands prefer this kind of
freedom and flexibility, possible in a democratic network like ONDC. Many international brands with India operations are showing interest to join ONDC. Many of the banks are at advanced stages of being integrated.
There have been complaints of poor user experience, slow deliveries…
If the seller platform is not behaving properly, the buyer platform can refuse to take orders. In food, majority of the deliveries happened in an hour’s time. In few cases, there have been delays. All participants are refining their processes. They have an incentive to do so.

Malls start making more room for eateries after post-pandemic boom,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/malls-start-making-more-room-for-eateries-after-post-pandemic-boom/articleshow/100686592.cms,02-06-2023,"Shopping mall operators are doubling the space for restaurants at their existing and upcoming properties after seeing consistent footfall and revenue growth from eateries with the easing of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Food and beverages (F&B) outlets cover about 20% space in malls, up from about 10% three years ago.
""Customers are looking for unique ambiences, cuisines and experiential dining options. As a result, the earlier 12% space dedicated to F&B has now increased to anywhere between 18% and 20% depending on the size of the mall. F&B offerings also give a strong boost to customer footfall and revenue,"" said
Sameep Pathak
, CEO, malls,
Oberoi Realty Limited
.
For its upcoming mall in Borivali, Mumbai, the company said it will probably maintain a similar proportion of space for F&B.
Muhammad Ali
, CEO,
Forum Malls
of Bengaluru-based
Prestige
group, said the company has doubled the space given to eateries and even built a small mall having only restaurants and cinema.

"Retailers, eateries expand play to cash in on rising demand",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-eateries-expand-play-to-cash-in-on-rising-demand/articleshow/100659563.cms,01-06-2023,"Nearly a dozen listed retailers and quick-service restaurant chains added almost 4,700 stores - on an average about 13 a day - to their network during the last fiscal year, recording their fastest expansion in at least five years, as demand for discretionary and lifestyle products picked up.
As of March 31, these companies, including
Reliance Retail
,
Aditya Birla Fashion
& Retail, DMart, Tata's
Trent
,
Titan Co and Starbucks
together had 30,520 stores, according to data sourced from their latest investor presentations. In fiscal 2021-22, the number was 25,821.
""Our ability to execute, find the right places, ensuring they are built to suit, and everything is working well,"" said Titan chief executive (jewellery)
Ajoy Chawla
. ""Most of the franchisees want the second, third, fourth, fifth store and we are unable to fulfil their desire. They are even happy to take the next store 100 km away or 200 km away in another city, even internationally.""
With competition also intensifying in categories such as quick-service restaurants, it triggered aggressive store expansion. For instance, Starbucks, which started India operations in October 2012, recorded the fastest store expansion, adding 71 stores to take the overall door count to 333 last fiscal year.

""As we grow in size, as people become more aware as our economy grows, more people become aware of the offering and want to participate. You need to not just open stores, but ensure that when you open stores, they are profitable and do the numbers that they are supposed to,""
Tata Starbucks
CEO
Sushant Dash
told ET earlier this month.
Apart from store launches, retailers also opened larger stores in marquee properties to give better experience to shoppers. According to data from property consultancy firm Anarock, the share of transactions for retail space sized between 2,000 sq ft and 5,000 sq ft increased to 28% in 2022 from 24% the previous year. The store additions come despite an increase in the share of online sales in their overall sales since the beginning of the pandemic.
Sales of organised retail segments grew 34% during FY22-23 compared with the pre-pandemic FY20, a report by the
Retailers Association of India
(RAI) said. However, sales of lifestyle, apparel and discretionary products moderated for the second consecutive month to 6% in April due to a high base.

Running a retail company in India has high risk of getting imprisoned: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/running-a-retail-company-in-india-has-high-risk-of-getting-imprisoned-report/articleshow/100644528.cms,31-05-2023,"In the retail sector, running a company could be not just difficult but risky too.
There is a high chance of getting
imprisoned
as a large number compliance laws have criminal clauses. A
retail chain
with multiple retail establishments having operations across six cities and two states and a corporate office in a single state deals with 3,182
compliances
in a year, a report by
Teamlease
Regtech says.
Among them, 1,192 (or 37%) compliances contain imprisonment clauses. Approximately 43% of these clauses are contained in state laws while the rest are within Union laws. Labour laws account for as high as 54% of all the clauses.
Revealing these numbers, the report says while the compliance framework has been put in place to safeguard the customers, it has also raised the regulatory complexity faced by employers.
This division of law-making authority across various levels of government has created three levels of compliance - union, state and municipal. On average, a retail store faces a total of 490 compliances, of which 53% are at the union level, 44% are at the state level and the rest 3% are at the municipal level.
The Teamlease Regtech report mentions a monograph titled 'Jailed for Doing Business', co-authored by Gautam Chikermane and Rishi Agrawal, which uncovers the nature and extent of the risks of imprisonment faced by entrepreneurs in the country. The monograph highlights that a sizable portion of compliance clauses criminalises procedural violations and technical lapses rather than serious offences involving willful harm. It illustrates that in many cases, there is an equivalence between punishment for minor errors by entrepreneurs and for death due to negligence under the Indian Penal Code, 1860.

What the retail companies think of compliances
In a recent survey conducted by TeamLease Regtech among compliance officers of major retail companies, the key findings were as follows:
83% agreed to have missed at least one critical compliance during the 12 month period
91% agreed to pay fines and penalties in the 12- month period
85% agreed that their compliance needs a serious rethink
73% of compliance officers believe that third-party consultants have better liaisoning experience than they have internally
67% agreed to have poor control over their compliance documents
92% believed that they do not have the required visibility and control in their organisation's compliance program
32% The average cost of compliance consultants stood at approximately INR 100,000 per month, of which labour contributed approximately 32% of the cost
51% believed that keeping track of regulatory updates is challenging
Policy recommendations
Employer compliance in
India
needs a thorough re-imagination, says the report. The country’s entrepreneurs cannot compete in the 21st century with the 19th and 20th-century regulatory environment, it says. The report recommends a three-vector framework to undertake policy reforms for facilitating ease of doing business in the country -- decriminalisation, rationalisation and digitisation.
National Retail Trade Policy
A National Retail Trade Policy is currently under development by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. It has sought inputs from 16 departments and ministries over the policy as it will be geared towards the overall development of the retail industry. Furthermore, the department is also formulating a national e-Commerce policy to boost the online retail sector. A cohesive retail policy built on the pillars of simplification, standardization, and digitalization will pave the way for significant growth and accelerate a short-term economic recovery, says the Teamlease Regtech report.

The Kapsons Group story: How the retail and distribution conglomerate is building a vibrant legacy for the future,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/the-kapsons-group-story-how-the-retail-and-distribution-conglomerate-is-building-a-vibrant-legacy-for-the-future/articleshow/100581987.cms,29-05-2023,"A visionary aggregator in the aspirational retail landscape and a distinctive purveyor of fashion, Kapsons Group has been catering to the discerning tastes of a diverse range of consumers—from couture connoisseurs and now to tech-savvy Gen-Z disruptors—for the last 33 years. Founded in 1989 by the dynamic duo of Darpan Kapoor and Vipin Kapoor, this home-grown label had humble beginnings, with aspirations to serve the fashion-savvy populace of Chandigarh. Slowly and steadily, it grew beyond the union territory, spreading its wings to neighbouring states and eventually across the entire nation, commanding a presence in 25 stores across 20 cities and six states, outpacing many other domestic players in the industry.
Today, Kapsons Group has evolved into a powerhouse conglomerate of six companies, firmly rooted in the businesses of retail, distribution, technology, outsourcing, and service provision. As the first indigenous brand to house major global fashion labels under one roof, Kapsons offers a unique and inclusive shopping experience to customers of all demographics and genders.
In the financial year 2022-23, Kapsons Group scaled new heights, outshining its competitors in the market and emerging as a leading player in North India. With revenues touching a remarkable milestone of more than 500 crore rupees and garnering a growth of approximately 25%, Kapsons Group pulled out all the stops, collaborating with influencers to spread the word and activating digital marketing to capture new territories.

Why brokerage Bernstein sees Reliance winning India ecommerce war in long run,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/why-brokerage-bernstein-sees-reliance-winning-india-ecommerce-war-in-long-run/articleshow/100503915.cms,25-05-2023,"Reliance
is the best-placed player ahead of giants Amazon and
Walmart
in the $150-billion Indian ecommerce market, according to a note by brokerage Bernstein.
India is evolving into a three-player market with these three companies having cornered the lion's share among them, the note said.
As per Bernstein, what makes
Mukesh Ambani
's Reliance the most potent force is primarily a combination of three factors — largest retail store network, dominant telecom operations and strong digital media.
""We believe Reliance Retail/Jio is the best-positioned player in the largest and fastest-growing e-commerce market. The advantages of its retail network, mobile network, digital ecosystem and 'home field advantage' in a famously complex regulatory and operating environment mean in the long term, it will likely claim the lion's share of the USD 150 billion-plus e-commerce marketplace,"" the report said.
Bernstein believes the Indian ecommerce market will be different from other markets. The note cites distribution-related challenges and India's propensity to ""skip a generation in most technologies"" as reasons for that.

In a market like India, an integrated model (offline + online + prime) is critical for success, the brokerage said, as ""strong distribution capability and superior cost advantage (against online players) are required from the start.""
Reliance's disruptive, integrated playbook makes it the strongest contender for pole position in the Indian market, Bernstein noted.
Reliance is building the most expansive digital ecosystem in the country, the note observed. Apart from the company's offline and online strength, the report also take note of its ""compelling prime apps — JioTV, MyJio, JioSaavn and
Jio
Prime"".
Jio, the conglomerate's telecom arm, has 430 million mobile subscribers; its retail arm has 18,300 retail stores in India and $30 billion in sales. Besides, the company's digital mix is scaling up 17-18 per cent (USD 6 billion, e-commerce).
Reliance has 400,000-plus people in its retail business. In 2023 so far, it has hired about 69,000 new employees against about 66,500 exits). The turnaround in the company is lower than the 30-40 per cent annual churn seen in organised retail in the country, said the Bernstein note.
The company's recent sackings because of performance-related issues is less than 0.14 per cent of the entire workforce, it added.
India is coming up fast as a lucrative ecommerce market but is still seen as under-penetrated. As for company-wise market share,
Flipkart
($23 billion gross merchandise value or GMV) and Amazon ($18-20 billion GMV) lead on scale, with the two having about 60% market share currently. Reliance is third in the sweepstakes at present ($5.7 billion e-commerce sales) driven by attractive categories of fashion (Ajio) and JioMart (e-grocery), Berstein said.
On the competition among the three giants, Bernstein said fashion has become the largest category in e-commerce. It said fashion became the largest category with 25 per cent GMV share and grew over 40 per cent in 2022 while the mobile category grew 7 per cent in 2022.
India added over 40 million online shoppers in calendar year 2022 with 16 million added from fashion. Reliance has the strongest position in fashion, with Ajio and Reliance Trends with a 20 per cent market share, the report noted.

100 million people shopped from e-commerce brands on our network in 2023: GoKwik,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/100-million-people-shopped-from-e-commerce-brands-on-our-network-in-2023-gokwik/articleshow/100497425.cms,25-05-2023,"GoKwik
said that more than 100 million people shopped from
e-commerce
brands on its network in 2023, more than double compared to two years ago.
The incremental shoppers have largely come from small towns with Tier 3 account 46% of them. In addition, these came through new merchants in beauty and personal care, fashion, electronics, and health and nutrition categories. The rising merchant base of more than 150 brands only in these categories in getting pre-filled address checkout experience, it said.
“Our solutions, loaded with a deep understanding of solving problems at source backed by technology, analytics and artificial intelligence, are helping e-commerce brands unlock their true growth potential. Our shopper network is the biggest factor in helping brands provide a superlative checkout experience where the time to place orders reduces drastically,” said
Chirag Taneja
, Co-Founder and CEO, GoKwik. ""Brands on our network have also been able to increase COD serviceability reaching customers in every nook and corner of the country
While online shoppers continue to increase in India, COD remains a preferred mode of payment for them. For the financial year 22-23, 75% of the orders in GoKwik network were COD orders. Electronics, FMCG, fashion, health and wellness, beauty and jewellery were the biggest category contributors to COD orders in the network.
Taneja said that shoppers on the GoKwik network are expected to reach 350 million by 2025.

The network data also benefits the other problem faced by e-commerce merchants - RTO (return to origin) or failed deliveries, especially on cash-on-delivery (COD) purchases. However, GoKwik managed to contain RTO rates for the brands in its network even as COD orders continued to expand. For brands in fashion and health & wellness categories, the RTO rate was reduced by 30% and 38% respectively.
Moreover, having the safety net of RTO protection through GoKwik’s solutions, many brands were able to expand their COD serviceability across India. GoKwik added more than 7,600 unique pin codes to its network, bringing the total number of serviceable pin codes to over 31,600.

GoKwik is backed by Sequoia Capital, Matrix Partners India, RTP Global, Think Investments and other marquee investors and offers solutions backed by technology and data science to help e-commerce brands increase revenue growth and reduce return-to-origin (RTO).
According to a recent Redseer Research, the e-tailing market in India has been slowing since the pandemic to grow GMV at 22% in FY23 to reach $60 billion where the Jan-March quarter was effectively 2.5 times in scale compared to pre- covid same period.

Retailers hit pause as small towns slow down,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-hit-pause-as-small-towns-slow-down/articleshow/100483791.cms,25-05-2023,"Demand for lifestyle products, apparel and shoes is still subdued in smaller towns due to overall inflation, forcing a few retailers to scale down store opening guidance in tier-2 and tier-3 markets. This also comes amid sluggish sales growth for discretionary products in cities.
""There's definitely more supply in value
retail
space in tier-2, tier-3 towns compared to the pre-Covid days,"" Lalit Agarwal, chairman of hypermarket chain V-Mart, told analysts. ""We saw a lot of new stores getting built up in the last three years and almost 50%-60% additional number of stores got built by us as well as by the competitors. The demand definitely did not grow as per expectation.""
Unlike earlier slowdown in the value segment,
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
(ABFRL) saw growth tapering off across segments in the January-March quarter. Retail expansion guidance in
Pantaloons
has also been moderated to 40-50 stores compared to 60-70 earlier due to demand slowdown in small cities.
ABFRL
, however, is hoping for sentiment to improve by the festive period this year.
""At this point of time, we want to acknowledge the reality that is facing the business for the last couple of quarters and the softness that we continue to experience, particularly in smaller towns and that's the part of expansion that we want to slow down a little bit,""
Ashish Dikshit
, managing director of ABFRL told investors.
Most apparel and lifestyle retailers increased prices across categories over the past year, especially after cotton prices surged due to higher shipment costs and rupee depreciation. Now companies are hoping the trend would reverse.

Retailers may soon be asked to not demand customer phone numbers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retailers-may-soon-be-asked-to-not-demand-customer-phone-numbers/articleshow/100456316.cms,24-05-2023,"New Delhi:
Retailers
and shopkeepers will soon not be allowed to seek phone numbers of their customers while generating bills, according to a diktat by the department of consumer affairs, a senior government official said.
Taking the numbers of customers without their ""express consent"" is a breach and encroachment of privacy, said the official, without wanting to be identified.
The official added that such a move will be classified as an unfair trading practice defined as any business practice or act that is deceptive, fraudulent, or causes injury to a consumer.
Most large retailers mandatorily take down buyers' phone numbers while generating the bill for their purchases and use them for loyalty programmes or sending push messages.
The move has come after the department received several complaints from consumers about retailers insisting on getting their phone numbers. This will be communicated to all retailers through industry bodies representing retailers soon, the official added.
Live Events
While the implementation of these new rules may require some adjustments and initial costs for retailers, it is seen as a necessary step towards protecting consumer privacy and ensuring fair business practices in the
retail
sector, said experts.
While retailers will have to rework their systems in case this becomes a regulation, this won't stop them from asking for phone numbers of consumers as their loyalty programmes run on these numbers, said Devangshu Dutta, founder of Third Eyesight, a retail consultancy firm.
He added that retailers also use numbers for sending e-invoices and so this could have a cost impact and environmental impact.

""People have time till September to use the money, and that is the reason there is no rush this time. The business had started picking up from last week due to the wedding season and we believe that will continue,"" said a leading mall operator who did not wish to be identified.
Vijay Sales director
Nilesh Gupta
also said that the impact was marginal and due to better discounts via
credit
cards, consumer prefer to use that instead of cash.
Mall operators also said retailers are accepting the ₹2,000 notes and the marginal growth in sale this weekend can also be attributed to consumers shopping for vacations.
Fashion and lifestyle retailers such as
Shoppers Stop

Biba, Puma
, among others, are all accepting the notes of ₹2,000 denomination. While some retailers have seen marginal increase in cash transactions at their stores, most said there has been no significant impact on the withdrawal of the notes by the

India
to USD 10 billion annually by 2027. The company also wants to develop new suppliers in categories such as food, pharmaceuticals, consumables, health and wellness, and apparel and home textiles, a company spokesperson told PTI.
Officials from the Bentonville-headquartered firm recently held a virtual meeting with several domestic toy manufacturers here.
The company informed toy makers about their requirements and expected quality standards as it is directly engaging with the domestic toy makers for sourcing.
Global retailers such as
IKEA
are already sourcing toys from India for their international operations.
The move is significant and highlights India's growing strength in the toy industry, especially since India was a net importer of toys until a few years ago.

It was the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) which conceptualised and made it happen as it was the department officers who brought Walmart and toy association together.
Confirming the development, a company spokesperson said: ""Walmart's growth in sourcing from India includes expanding working with existing suppliers and helping develop new suppliers in categories such as food, pharmaceuticals, consumables, health and wellness along with apparel and home textiles. We are also exploring opportunities in toys, shoes, and bicycles.""
In December 2020, Walmart committed to triple its exports of goods from India to USD 10 billion each year by 2027, providing a significant boost to micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) here.
""The expansion in sourcing will include helping develop hundreds of new suppliers in categories such as food, pharmaceuticals, consumables, health & wellness and general merchandise, along with apparel, homeware and other key Indian export categories,"" it had said.
Earlier this month,
Walmart Inc
President and CEO Doug McMillon reaffirmed its commitment during his visit to India and said that India's unique ecosystem of suppliers will help the company in achieving its goal of exporting goods worth USD 10 billion from the country annually by 2027.
Addressing Indian suppliers, Doug McMillon has reaffirmed the roadmap for strengthening partnerships with Indian communities, expanding opportunities for Indian businesses and fostering transformative and innovative solutions for retail from India to the world.
McMillon had also met Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
and tweeted, ""Thank you Prime Minister @narendramodi for a great conversation. We are working toward exporting USD 10B per year from India by 2027 and are committed to strengthening logistics, skill development & supply chains to make India a global export leader in toys, seafood & other goods.""
""The visit with Prime Minister @narendramodi reinforces the shared value we bring working alongside India. Together, we'll continue to support the country's manufacturing growth and create opportunity,"" McMillon was quoted as saying in a tweet by Walmart Inc.
The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), which is taking a series of steps to promote domestic manufacturing of toys, is also helping Indian manufacturers tie up with the global players to meet their compliance provisions and increase exports from India.
When asked about the issue, Manu Gupta, promotor of
Playgro Toys India
and Chairman of
Toy Association of India
, said a US-based retailer has approached the industry to procure toys in three main categories, including ride-on and outdoor toys and mechanical and electrical toys, worth USD 400 million.
He said DPIIT officials are helping the industry engage with these world players and get orders.
The country's toy exports were worth Rs 1,017 crore during April-December 2022-23. In 2021-22, the exports stood at Rs 2,601 crore. During April-December 2013-14, the shipments were at Rs 167 crore.
The overall import of toys in India reduced by 70 per cent to Rs 870 crore in 2021-22.
In February 2020, import duty on toys was raised from 20 per cent to 60 per cent and now, it has increased to 70 per cent this year, with an aim to discourage imports.
The government is also considering rolling out a fiscal incentive scheme -- PLI (production-linked incentive) -- for toys.
In 2020, the government issued a Toys (Quality Control) Order. As per the order, toys have to conform to the requirements of relevant Indian standards and bear the standard mark under a licence. It is applicable to both domestic as well as foreign manufacturers who intend to export their toys to India.
The
QCO
has been issued to ensure that consumers, who are children only below the age of 14 years, are not exposed to sub-standard goods/ goods containing toxic material/toys containing toxic material.

FDI panel nod not needed for Shein-Reliance licensing pact: Officials,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/fdi-panel-nod-not-needed-for-shein-reliance-licensing-pact-officials/articleshow/100364526.cms,20-05-2023,"Chinese fashion giant Shein's licensing agreement with
Reliance
Retail Ventures Limited doesn't require an approval from the
FDI
Proposal Review Committee, as there is no equity investment by
Shein
into the Indian company, officials said.
Under the agreement, Shein will license its technology and trademarks to be used by Reliance Retail and to also develop an indigenous e-commerce retail platform for Indian consumers that would sell Shein branded products.
""Ownership and control of the platform will always remain with RRVL's subsidiary, a 100% Indian company,"" said an official. The platform will be specifically for the Indian market and would sell made in India products.
However, an approval under Press Note 3 would be required if Shein plans to invest in India. There are three textile related proposals - including one under the Production Linked Incentive scheme and another, a Hong Kong based company - which have come from India's land border sharing countries and would require the committee's approval.
The committee is headed by the Union Home Secretary and was constituted for closer scrutiny of security clearances for FDI proposals from India's land border sharing countries to prevent Chinese companies circumvent rules to acquire entities in India.

""Such a license agreement has been done for the first time...There is going to be no equity investment by Shein into the Indian company...An approval would be required under PN3 If Shein plans to invest in India,"" said an official.
As per the official, any payment to Shein will only be made out of profits of the Indian company and that there is no fixed payment committed to Shein.
Allaying security concerns, officials said that ownership and control of the platform will always remain with Reliance Retail's subsidiary, a 100% Indian company.
The platform and servers will be hosted exclusively within India there would be no customer data transfer outside India, and Shein will not have any access to, or rights over, such data due to localization of infrastructure and platform data.
""The India app would be walled off from Shein's global app. This could become a template. The servers will be in India. Foreign companies will have no access to Indian data. No provision of data transfer. There is a wall between the global app and the Indian app,"" the official said.
At present, 93% of Shein's sourcing is from China but the partnership with RRVL involves integrating 25,000 MSMEs.
""This will create potential export opportunity of an approximately Rs 50,000 crore from India, even if only 25% of the existing global demand of Shein is sourced from India,"" the official said.

Sales

While retail sales grew in strong double digits consistently over the past year, it slowed to 6% in both March and April - the slowest sales expansion in over 14 months, according to
Retailers Association of India
(RAI).
""The slowdown was visible since February and it continued till April. However, from May, there is slight improvement as people started buying for the upcoming wedding season. We hope for it to improve further during the end of season sale,"" said Devarajan Iyer – Executive Director & CEO (Lifestyle).

Retailers report 6% growth in April 2023
Large quick-service restaurant chains such as Domino's, KFC, Pizza Hut and Burger King have reported either declining or flat growth in March quarter, as consumers downtraded to lower ticket sizes and multiple lower-priced boutique brands such as Leo's, Tossin, GoPizza and Mojo Pizza started to take away share from the larger companies.
Cos Continuing with Store Expansion
While Domino's operator
Jubilant
FoodWorks' like-for-like sales declined 0.6% in the January-March quarter,
Sapphire Foods
, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut, reported near flat same-store sales for KFC at 2%, and decline of 4% for Pizza Hut.
Analysts attributed the decline to high prices from large players and competition from smaller brands.
""Same-store sales growth continues to be flat for Jubilant impacted by decline in average ticket sizes and consumers downtrading due to inflation. Both delivery and dine-in segments have been moderate, and overall revenue growth has underperformed retail expansion,"" ICICI Securities wrote in a report on Wednesday.

In an earnings statement, Shyam S Bhartia, chairman of Jubilant FoodWorks, said: ""There are near-term concerns around historic high inflation and slowing market growth, but we are confident on our ecosystem's ability to tap on the potential that lies ahead of us and reorient the business to deliver sustained profitable growth.""
Devyani International
, which also operates KFC and Pizza Hut, said in a management commentary that while demand environment was improving led by receding inflation and falling raw material prices, dairy prices still remain elevated and that may drag down profitability.
The companies, however, said they are continuing with store expansion in expectation of demand improvement in the next few quarters.
""For us, markets in cities of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are showing signs of stress; however in South and West, there isn't much impact,"" said Siddharath Bindra, managing director, BIBA Fashion Limited.

CEO (jewellery) Ajoy Chawla said in an earnings call. ""May and June promises to be good because of many good wedding dates. We are hopeful that we should be able to deliver to the plans we've laid out, volatility notwithstanding.""
RAI said the growth was slow due to a base of 23% in April 2022 as compared to pre-pandemic period (April 2019) and 41% growth when compared to sales level in April 2021.
""Higher inflation in advanced global economies and tightening financial conditions in India have had some impact on demand, particularly in tier 2 and tier 3 cities,"" Venugopal G Nair, managing director and chief executive officer of
Shoppers Stop
, said during the firm's FY23 analyst call.
""Last year, during these times, we were witnessing pent-up demand in March and April and that has considerably moderated this year. This had impacted our sales in February and March. However, we have seen green shoots in April,"" he said.

Quick commerce now fastest growing sales channel for packaged goods brands,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/quick-commerce-now-fastest-growing-sales-channel-for-packaged-goods-brands/articleshow/100341332.cms,19-05-2023,"Quick commerce

Nestle
have said.
“Quick commerce is the fastest growing channel for us now online,” Suresh Narayanan, chairman of
Nestle India
, told ET. “I will not say it’s overtaken the regular platforms. But in the last quarter, more than half of the growth in ecommerce came from quick commerce,” he said.
Narayanan said the sales channel has become a sustainable proposition for consumers. “Of course, it’s fiercely competitive,” he said. “The sheer convenience of consumers getting what they want in a short period of time saves them the burden of doing pantry shopping.”

Britannia CEO Rajneet Kohli said the uptick through quick commerce is more prominent in certain categories.

“If I have to put it in very, very simple terms, it’s quick commerce that's leading, followed by ecommerce,” he told ET. “There is a clear uptick that’s happening on the quick commerce side. And very much so in certain categories.”
So, is it a matter of time before quick commerce catches up with the likes of Flipkart and Amazon? Perhaps not. Because now is a time when new users are hard to come by for quick commerce companies as they struggle to expand beyond the top cities.
“Quick commerce growth has already started to slow down,” said Hari Menon, CEO of BigBasket. “This is typical of high-growth businesses when they start and settle down soon. That's already happening,” he said.
Menon said food companies benefitted the most from quick commerce. “Sales of food on quick commerce is significantly higher than non-food (personal care, beauty, general merchandise, etc),” he said. “What sold in food was snacks, beverages, ready to eat/cook, pet food, etc. Hence companies like Britannia and Nestle grew well on quick commerce platforms.”
ETtech
The ratio between BigBasket’s next-day or same-day delivery service and quick commerce in terms of business is currently about 68:32, Menon said.
Quick commerce is the fastest-growing channel for many new-age direct-to-commerce or online shopping-focused brands, too, but it is nowhere close to surpassing traditional ecommerce channels.
Suhasini Sampath, cofounder of FMCG upstart Yogabar, said Amazon and Flipkart contribute about 70% of its online sales.
“Quick commerce for us plays a more important role in kind of getting feedback from product launches,” she said. “But as a channel, it still only contributes to about 10% of our overall sales.”
Sampath, though, said there has been no slowdown for Yogabar in terms of sales growth through quick commerce despite discounts drying up and as platforms facing a slowdown in terms of new user addition.
Swiggy Instamart does about 450,000 orders in a day on average with an average order value of about Rs 400, a person in the know told ET.
Nexus Venture Partners-backed Zepto does about 300,000 orders in a day, a senior company executive said.
Blinkit delivered 31.6 million orders in the quarter ended December 2022, according to Zomato’s financial statement, with an average order value of Rs 524.
ETtech
Swiggy did not comment on specific queries sent by ET about its daily order volumes but said that Instamart has proven to be a great sales channel for established consumer brands.
“Today, Instamart is fast becoming one of the largest online
distribution
channels for many of the country's leading CPG/FMCG brands,” a Swiggy Instamart spokesperson said. “Specially designed tools, including brand pages and other ways for them to display multiple products and exciting new launches, have helped legacy brands with their objective of engaging with consumers, driving awareness, and maximising reach and sales on Instamart.”
Aadit Palicha, cofounder and CEO of Zepto, did not specifically comment on their daily order volumes or GMV, but said the company is one of the fastest-growing internet companies in the country.
“This model has deep product market fit and the market is massive, so it is not a surprise at all,” he said. “Some of the brands that we work with, a year from now will see the
quick commerce channel
to be bigger than modern trade.”
ET had reported on January 5 that Instamart’s new user addition had slowed down significantly after crossing the 300,000 mark.
Industry executives point out that beyond the top cities, which have high population density, it is difficult for dark stores to turn profitable.
Investors are also shying away from investing in high-cash burn businesses amid tightening macroeconomic conditions.
As quick commerce companies have been finding it hard to attract new users, they are trying to increase the spending of existing users who have signed up. ET reported in December last year that companies have been nudging users to place more items in a single order in order to increase average order value.
Companies have also been expanding categories, adding products in beauty and personal care, pharmaceuticals, and pet care, among others.

chairman Anoop Kumar Mittal, emerged the only bidder seeking to take over the whole of
Future Retail
as the bids for the defunct retailer were opened on Thursday.
Space Mantra's offer of ₹550 crore, however, is less than 3% of the total outstanding dues of ₹19,200 crore of financial creditors and is also conditional on it being able to realise value from the sale of remaining assets in the company, people aware of the development said.
The creditors have also received five other much smaller bids for different parts of the retailer, they said.
The bids will now be given to process advisor Alvarez & Marsal for evaluation.
""Creditors have received six bids, most of them for different parts of the business,"" said a person aware of the process. ""Space Mantra is the only bidder to have submitted a plan to take over the whole company. However, the plan is a weak one and includes many conditions like payment to lenders only after assets have been sold.""

Space Mantra, promoted by Mittal and Ashish Agarwal, is registered as a retailer of building material, the person said.
Its plan envisages a payment of ₹550 crore after completing the sale of the assets within six months of handing over the company.
""However, if the sale of assets doesn't materialise, then the company has reserved its right to give back the asset to the lenders,"" the person said.
The low recovery rate as well as preconditions to the bid by Space Mantra is likely to put off lenders.
However, chances of recovery from the retailer look bleak as company has no running stores and its brand value has been eroded due to the long bankruptcy process.
""This account looks like is heading for liquidation,"" a second person aware of the process said. ""There are no strong bids and lenders will avoid getting into a situation where they are at the mercy of bidders for even little recovery,"" the person added.
Resolution professional Vijaykumar Iyer did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
Lenders had hoped for some recovery after both
Reliance Industries
and Adani Group had expressed interest in bidding for Future Retail. However, both top conglomerates have refrained from making any binding bids, as ET reported in its Wednesday edition.
To be sure, the company's assets have been eroded as all the consumable inventory is past expiry and most of its stores have been taken over by
Reliance
Retail after their lease ran out. Currently, the company has 302 stores, its brand value, some furniture and fixtures, non-perishable inventory, and investments in subsidiaries, which can be valued, lenders said.

Reliance Retail is set to bring Chinese fashion giant Shein to India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/shein-to-re-enter-india-in-partnership-with-reliance-retail/articleshow/100337024.cms,19-05-2023,"Reliance Retail
is set to bring Chinese fashion giant Shein to India through a strategic partnership, over two years after the latter's app was banned by the Indian government, executives aware of the developments said.
“Shein is likely to source from India for other countries as well, since it is facing scrutiny in the US,” one of the executives said.
The Centre had banned Shein, one of the world’s largest fashion retailers, from selling its products in India through its own app over two years back as part of a larger crackdown on Chinese apps following escalated border conflicts.
“Shein’s positioning of affordable and trendy clothing will complement Reliance’s portfolio, which also sells affordable fashion through its own store chain Reliance Trends,” said the executive cited above.

World's biggest fashion brand Zara's India sales increase 40% in FY23
Shein had created a niche for new styles and accessible price points in India before its app was banned by the home ministry in 2020.
A Wednesday report by Wall Street Journal said Shein has raised $2 billion in its latest funding round, but at two-thirds of its $100-billion valuation from last year. The lower valuation is on account of declining tech share prices and increased pressure from US lawmakers regarding its labour and environmental practices, the report said.
Shein, which competes with fast fashion labels such as H&M and Zara, closed the last financial year with revenue of $23 billion.
While the app of Shein was blocked on grounds that it “was detrimental to national security”, the Ministry of Electronics and information Technology (MeitY) had said sale of Shein products on other platforms or websites is not covered under Section 69A and that a blanket order for blocking their sale cannot be passed by the committee constituted under the legal provision.

Other Chinese etailer apps such as Ali Express were also banned.
Earlier in 2019, Shein had to stall shipping orders and refund customer payments following crackdowns by state authorities that alleged that Chinese shopping sites were paying lower duties than what they were supposed to.
While some inventory of Shein is available on marketplace Amazon in India, the label is not a scale brand yet in the country.
Reliance
has been partnering with fashion labels in various genres and adding Shein will give its fast-fashion portfolio further push through physical stores and online, a second executive aware of the negotiations said.

In addition, it has strategic partnerships with domestic fashion brands, including designers Manish Malhotra, Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, Satya Paul, Raghavendra Rathore and Anamika Khanna.

An Indian biryani won’t democratize e-commerce: Will bringing local bazaars under ONDC work?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/e-commerce-are-open-digital-markets-indias-next-big-thing/articleshow/100315080.cms,18-05-2023,"The man behind India’s globally acclaimed payments revolution — and before that, Aadhaar, the world’s biggest digital identity project — has found a new calling: democratizing burgers and biryani.
Restaurant-delivery platforms are already worried about
Infosys Ltd
. Chairman
Nandan Nilekani
’s newest foray into public-policy evangelism:
Open Network Digital Commerce
. But it isn’t just food or groceries. An unbundling of
e-commerce in India
could upend billions of dollars of investment. Walmart Inc. is tentatively supporting the government-backed initiative to see where it goes. Amazon.com Inc. has so far agreed to integrate its logistics services — from pickup to delivery — with
ONDC
.
If China led the quick-response, or QR, code revolution, India’s singular contribution to the world of money in the last seven years has been the Unified Payments Interface, a powerful idea that has made deposits scattered around different banks as easy to spend with a smartphone as cash. The model, which got copied around the globe, now has its biggest success in Brazil’s Pix platform, which has made cards all but redundant. There are plans to replicate India’s UPI at a global scale in money transfers across borders.
Meanwhile, Nilekani has shifted his gaze to e-commerce. Around 75% of Indians with internet access are not shopping online, while only 5 million out of the country’s 100 million micro, small and medium firms are registered to sell digitally. Only a fraction of them garner meaningful business on platforms. In a report with the consulting firm McKinsey & Co., ONDC, the non-profit that has emerged as a result of Nilekani’s advocacy and the government’s blessings, describes how it will expand this stunted landscape:
ONDC presents an alternative to the existing platform-centric model. Moving the diverse Indian bazaar of goods and services online democratizes digital commerce for buyers and sellers. Buyers can tap into it using any participating app to launch a search for an item. The network makes it possible for them to connect with thousands of sellers across the country who sell on ONDC via their preferred seller app. Within seconds, the customer sees a set of choices at a range of price points, along with transparent options for delivery modes, times, and costs provided by a choice of logistics operators.
Live Events
The political bluster accompanying ONDC, however, is undermining the project’s economic promise. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal says India will use the “full force of the government” to promote the open e-commerce network. The two American-owned market leaders, Walmart’s Flipkart marketplace and Amazon’s India shopping site, can expect the rhetoric to get louder as next year's general elections draw nearer. Those who don’t come on board now with their customer data will repent because, as TechCrunch quoted the minister as saying recently, at some stage “we will also have to cut off those who are left behind.”
The threats and warnings are adding an unnecessarily statist undertone to ONDC’s technocratic pitch. Although they're growing rapidly, online sales account for just 7% of all of India’s commerce, most of which passes through millions of mom-and-pop shops. India has a real problem of emerging duopolies in government-regulated sectors like telecom and transport. But for some reason, New Delhi is giving the impression that cheaper chicken tikka for the middleclass is a policy priority.
At least that’s where the project is at. In Bengaluru and New Delhi, thousands of online restaurant orders are bypassing Swiggy and Zomato, the two popular online food-delivery platforms. Customers are discovering McChicken meals for 190 rupees ($2.30) on a fintech app like
Paytm
when the same thing is selling on
Zomato
Ltd.’s site for 204 rupees. (Hat tip to Moneycontrol, which did the price comparisons recently.)
Paytm is getting behavioral data by seeing more of its users’ shopping transactions; fulfilling those orders is not its headache. Walmart is a more reluctant campaigner. After all, the government’s open bazaar won’t stop at aggregating meal orders or auto-rickshaw rides. Participating too vigorously might mean cannibalizing Flipkart, its main retail business. That’s perhaps why Walmart's PhonePe payments unit has designed Pincode, a custom-built app for hyperlocal shopping. But Goyal has cottoned on to this, and threatened to exclude those e-commerce players that are not coming to the network with their main platforms.
I remain skeptical of ONDC, and not only because of its clunky moniker. (Good luck wooing millennials and Gen Z with that acronym.) The word-of-mouth popularity is largely due to a 50-rupees-per-transaction initial discount that the banks backing ONDC are funding. Take that away, drop the subsidies on delivery charges and eliminate the incentives to sellers, and this is where the dust will likely settle — restaurants will get a slightly better deal than now, forcing Swiggy and Zomato to lower their commissions and improve service. There will be no revolution.
Aadhaar, the unique number used to authenticate people’s identity digitally, took off because the state put its coercive power behind it. The payments innovation succeeded because money enjoys a universal sameness — demand deposits are immediately convertible into a predefined amount of sovereign-issued cash, no questions asked. When that assurance comes under a doubt, like during the recent US bank failures, authorities take extraordinary steps.
Everything other than money, however, is a little differentiated. Vegetables are fresher in one shop, cheaper in another. Affluent customers go for the largest possible shampoo bottle, while poor families buy small sachets because that’s all they can afford. Everyday staples have proved challenging, not only for pure e-commerce players but even for the Mumbai-based tycoon Mukesh Ambani’s massive network of mom-and-pop stores. It’s just very hard in a country of India’s size and diversity to have the supply chain so well-primed that the exact thing the consumer wants is available in the neighborhood shop.
In theory, the idea of breaking up e-commerce looks nice. One set of apps can let buyers search for products, another can allow sellers to upload their inventory and enable logistics players to offer their services. As a participant in the ONDC experiment told me, the democratization Nilekani is seeking could end up playing the same role as the “Third Front” in Indian politics. The country’s two main political organizations, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its main opposition, the Congress, can never rule out an alliance of regional groupings, however improbable. This acts as a check on the behavior of the political system. ONDC won’t replace Amazon and Walmart, but the consumer's bargaining position will be improved by the presence of a third actor. And unlike the zero-sum game of politics, there may be an opportunity here to expand the market.
The larger businesses may exploit the potential first. Unilever Plc’s India unit or
ITC Ltd
., the tobacco giant that hawks everything from wheat flour and soap to paper and hotel rooms, could connect their brands with ONDC’s so-called seller apps. Their products already enjoy consumer trust. Becoming discoverable outside the top e-commerce platforms means adding a distribution channel. Over time, the benefits may trickle down. Some hyperlocal enterprises will gain customers, and some artisans’ popularity will expand beyond their immediate domains. But it won’t address the paucity of purchasing power at the bottom of the economic pyramid, the real constraint on e-commerce in India.
When you unbundle a service, you reintroduce all the wrinkles someone had made it their business to remove: Wrong shirt size, cold food, smelly rides, no returns, no refunds — and nobody to blame on Twitter except a nonprofit. Before religious festivals, algorithms at India’s popular e-commerce platforms are on high alert for spikes in orders of “decorative” swords. Those can be used to trigger riots, seriously denting the reputational capital of behemoths like Amazon and Walmart. Will ONDC be equipped to handle this bewildering gamut of complexity?
It’s fine for the government to promote ONDC, but it must ask how much coercion it wants to employ and to what end. If open, unfettered markets could do everything, why do we still have profit-making organizations? That question, asked by the Nobel Prize-winning economist Ronald Coase, in his 1937 paper, “The Nature of the Firm,” remains alive even with digitization slashing transaction costs. Out of the 11,000 ONDC orders on April 30, as many as 10,000 were touched in some way by Magicpin, an Indian startup, Moneycontrol has reported. It’s still early days, but there may be no escaping the winner-take-all phenomenon even with open markets. For all the hype around cheap meals, Nilekani’s democratization of commerce might turn out to be a nothingburger.

Iyer has admitted Rs 17,511 crore in claims from financial creditors. “But it is unlikely that they will receive even 5% of the dues,” said one of the lenders.
The resolution professional has yet not opened the plans received from these six bidders, the people said.
Future Enterprises
,
Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd
and
Future Supply Chain
are among the Future Group companies admitted for corporate insolvency over the past one year.
Trouble at the Future group started with the nationwide lockdown in March 2020. Most of the malls where Future stores were located remained shut.
Subsequently, it failed to clinch a Rs 24,713-crore deal with Reliance Industries to sell its retail and wholesale business in a slump sale after secured lenders voted against the scheme of arrangement.
Lenders said they did not receive any clarity on how much
money
they would get from Reliance after it took possession of more than 900 large-format Future Retail stores. Reliance took over these stores in a phased manner, beginning 2022, due to non-payment of rentals by Future Group.
Iyer has admitted Rs 4,109 crore in claims from offshore bondholders, constituting 23.4% of voting rights.
Bank
of New York Mellon, the trustee of the offshore bondholders, has filed the claim at their behest.
Among others, Bank of Baroda’s verified claim is Rs 2,143 crore, equating to 12.2% of voting rights.
Union Bank of India
has an exposure of Rs 1,894 crore, equating to 10.8% of voting rights.

Financial creditors have claimed around Rs 20,000 crore from Future Retail, according to ET NOW sources.
Earlier in April, the Mumbai-based NCLT bench granted FRL an extension of 90 days till July 15, 2023, for concluding the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP).
On March 23, 2023, creditors of FRL invited new EoIs whereby prospective buyers can bid for the debt-ridden firm ""as a going concern or individual cluster or a combination of clusters of its assets"", as it failed to attract a resolution plan in more than four months.
Earlier, it had received EoIs and finalised 11 prospective bidders, including Reliance and April Moon Retail, but could not get a resolution plan despite two extensions in the deadline for submissions.
The Committee of Creditors had provided two options in the EoI, for which the last date for submission was April 7, 2023.
CIRP was initiated against FRL by its lender Bank of India following loan defaults.
Under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, EoI was invited from prospective bidders on October 4, 2022.
FRL operated multiple retail formats in both the hypermarket supermarket and home segments under brands such as Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Foodhall. At its peak, FRL was operating more than 1,500 outlets in nearly 430 cities.
It was part of the 19 Future group companies operating in the retail, wholesale, logistic and warehousing segments, which were supposed to be transferred to Reliance Retail as part of a Rs 24,713 crore-deal announced in August 2020.
However, lenders had rejected the takeover of the 19 Future group companies, including FRL, by Reliance amid a legal challenge by Amazon.
Last year in August, stock market regulator Sebi ordered a forensic audit of the accounts of FRL for the financial years 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22.

in
Tiruppur
and
Noida
have decided to shut their manufacturing units for 10-15 days a month to reduce operational costs amid a shortage of overseas orders, said executives. However, the apparel exporting units have not decided to lay off any workers yet, they said.
About 80% units in Noida have a month's orders in hand, while in Tiruppur, orders have fallen 40-50% compared to the previous year. Tiruppur's exporters said global brands have not placed any major orders for this year's Christmas season.
""We are now waiting for spring-summer orders for next year which are placed in September,"" said Raja Shanmugam, owner of knitwear firm
Warsaw International
.
The slowdown in key markets such as the US and European Union has hit knitwear exports from the Tiruppur cluster, Asia's largest textiles export hub, which accounts for more than half of India's knitwear exports. There are 30,000 units in the Tiruppur cluster, including ancillary units too.
Live Events
""The units are going in for temporary shutdown for 10-15 days a month as the order position is not good. This will help the units keep a check on operational costs even though the profit margins will be impacted. The situation is likely to improve in September when global orders may start coming in,"" said Shanmugam, also a former president of
Tiruppur Exporters Association
.
As per provisional figures, knitwear exports from Tiruppur increased 2.5% year-on-year to ₹34,350 crore in 2022-23. The growth rate was not only lower than the historical trend, except during the pandemic, but also lower than the country's overall knitwear export growth of 3.76%. ""It will be lesser in 2023-24 compared to 2022-23,"" said Shanmugam.
In the
Noida apparel export cluster
, nearly 70% units have just a month's orders in hand. ""Only the big units have good orders in hand but the medium and smaller units are suffering from very few orders. These units are working at 30-40% capacity,"" said Lalit Thukral, president of Noida Apparel Export Cluster, which houses 3,000 units and exports readymade garments worth ₹30,000 crore.
The paucity of orders notwithstanding, the apparel exporting units in Tiruppur and Noida have not yet decided to retrench any workers. ""It will not be easy for us to find skilled workers when the order situation improves. Already we have seen a large exodus of migrant workers during Covid-19,"" said Thukral.

The development comes amidst a legal battle that the Wadia group is fighting with lessors to admit its group company Go First Airlines for voluntary liquidation. While the
National Company Law Tribunal
has approved it, lessors have opposed the move at the appellate tribunal.
On Bombay Dyeing, Care Ratings has stated that ‘repayments in FY24 are tightly matched with expected cash flows and available liquidity whereas FY25 repayments needs to be refinanced if the company is not able to raise funds through rights issue and asset monetisation.’
Bombay Dyeing management has conveyed to the rating company that if there is an unanticipated delay in the rights issue and planned monetization, it has receivables from sold flats, expected cash flows from sales of balance inventory, lease rentals, and liquid investments in the form of equity shares held in Wadia group companies for servicing debt repayments in FY24.
“However, these resources continue to remain inadequate over the long-term debt horizon, necessitating
Bombay Dyeing
to resort to alternative avenues to support debt repayment, especially for FY25,” Care Ratings stated.
In FY23, the company reported Rs 517 crore losses ‘due to continued high interest and inventory write down in the real estate segment in Q4FY23,’ Care stated. The promoters sold shares of group company
Bombay Burmah
&
National Peroxide
and infused money in the form of inter-corporate deposits. It holds shares worth Rs 194 of Bombay Burmah as on March 31, 2023 as against RS 367 crore a year ago.
The company’s rights issue was originally scheduled to complete by end March 2023 however, it has not received approval from the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
In October last year, Sebi barred the company from accessing the capital market alleging faulty interpretation of accounting standards. Securities Appellate Tribunal has stayed Sebi’s order following an appeal by the company.

"Starbucks's 'Arpit or Arpita' ad goes viral, internet remains divided",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/starbuckss-arpit-or-arpita-ad-goes-viral-internet-remains-divided/articleshow/100184677.cms,12-05-2023,"#BoycottStarbucks was one of the top trends on Twitter after it latest campaign ‘It Starts With Your Name’ sparked a controversy. The
Starbucks ad
was posted on Twitter on May 10 and it has gone viral. It has been viewed over 7,12,000 times as of now.
In the advertisement posted on Twitter, an elderly couple wait for their son Arpit to arrive at a
Starbucks
store. The mother urges the father to remain calm as he looked upset seemingly with his son's decision to undergo sex change and change the name to Arpita. Then a young girl arrives and sits next to the couple. It also seemed that the parents were meeting their transgender daughter for the first time after she changed her sex.
The father then orders coffee for the entire family. The ad has an emotional family reunion moment when the Starbucks barista says, ""Three cold coffees for Arpita"" as the transgender daughter realizes her father’s acceptance of her decision.
— StarbucksIndia (@StarbucksIndia)
""Your name defines who you are - whether it's Arpit or Arpita. At Starbucks, we love and accept you for who you are. Because being yourself means everything to us,"" captions the Starbucks ad.

A section of social media users have called for boycott of Starbucks while others welcomed it.
""Fail to understand the need for a multinational to get into sensitive topics in a country of hypersensitive sentimental people. Huge dent in the brand,"" @ProfMKay tweeted.
Another user @sasguy235 tweeted: ""I understand the Father’s Pain and Dilemma BUT his Son just could no longer live as someone whom he never associated himself with and that is the Harsh Truth. This is LIFE . Not always what we want it to be. Bold ad by @StarbucksIndia.""
The Starbucks ad comes at a time when the Supreme Court is hearing petitions seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriage.
Starbucks had started India operations in 2012 and operates over 300 stores in the country. In FY23, Starbucks’ India sales crossed the Rs 1,000-crore sales mark for the first time since it set up shop in the country a decade ago. At Rs 1,087 crore, it was up 71% from FY22. Last year, it had launched masala chai and filter coffee in India on a pilot basis and also revamped its menu to attract consumers with Indianised and more affordable options.

The government has said existing platforms are tightly controlled, keeping out many small players. It expects
ONDC
to increase competition and foster start-up innovation.
T. Koshy said the company was in talks with cab operators to launch operations in at least four cities, after successfully launching mobility operations in two cities in South India.
More than 55,000 taxi cab owners have already joined the network, and consumers were using it for about 35,000 rides a day, he said.
The platform has helped cab owners to provide services while saving on hefty commissions paid to other platforms and offer lower rates to passengers, said Shaikh Salauddin, head of Telengana Four Wheeler Drivers Association, and a taxi driver.
""The ONDC move has helped to promote fair competition in the e-commerce and helping consumers and small players.""
ONDC aims to raise e-commerce penetration in the next two years to 25% of India's consumer purchases, from nearly 8% now, in a country of 1.4 billion people.
On Tuesday, the government said the state-run Indian postal service, which has a network of nearly 160,000 post offices, will also join the ONDC network to provide logistics services to small traders across the country.

chief executive
Doug McMillon
said India has a very bright future and that his company, the world’s largest retailer, is “hoping to be a part of this economy for decades and decades”.
“There's going to be a lot of growth here and I think it's going to be inclusive growth,” McMillon said, while addressing the Indian suppliers and partners across Walmart and its units Flipkart,
PhonePe
, Walmart Global Tech and Walmart Sourcing on Tuesday in Bengaluru.
About 20 years ago, McMillon’s responsibility was in merchandising and at that time India was considered to be a great opportunity from a sourcing point of view for Walmart’s other markets, within a very narrow set of categories.
“To be here today and to understand that India has these opportunities across so many categories is really exciting to me,” McMillon said.
What happens in India in the next 20 years is going to be remarkable, he said. Walmart is building an ecosystem of suppliers and partners, including small and medium enterprises, to meet the company’s goal of sourcing $10 billion of Indiamade goods by 2027, he said. “Walmart is committed to India and we are here for the long term.

"ONDC caps incentives for sellers; price difference with Swiggy, Zomato may reduce",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ondc-caps-incentives-for-sellers-price-difference-with-swiggy-zomato-may-reduce/articleshow/100128447.cms,10-05-2023,"While
ONDC
has emerged as a cheaper and increasingly popular alternative to
Swiggy
and
Zomato
due to discounts and free deliveries, the glaring price difference between the platforms is set to reduce.
In a recent communication to seller-side applications on the network, ONDC has clarified that the incentives for subsidising delivery cost for buyers will now be capped. The new cap came into effect from May 9.
As orders on ONDC have scaled up, peaking to 25,000 orders for food and groceries over the weekend, ONDC sent a communication to seller-network participants on May 7, indicating a few changes.
So far, ONDC was offering an incentive of up to Rs 75 as discount to be provided for logistics for buyers on every eligible order. But with the recent amendment to the clause, ONDC has added two new additional conditions.
The incentive will be provided only up to a maximum incentive of Rs 225,000 per seller-side app per day, and a maximum incentive of Rs 3,750 per seller per day.

Initially, the incentive also had some qualifications, which entailed that seller-side apps have to “send zero delivery charges for all hyperlocal deliveries and subsidised charges for inter-city delivery”. The clause also mentioned that ONDC expected the “buyer app to communicate free delivery to the buyer as soon as possible in the buyer journey to generate demand”.
This meant that the customer was not being charged for delivery for most hyperlocal orders.
But this clause now stands deleted as of May 9.
This means that buyers will start seeing delivery charges by some restaurants and grocery outlets, especially if these sellers have breached the cap imposed by ONDC.
Also, the price difference between ONDC and Swiggy-Zomato, which has so far gone up to 50%-60% may now be reduced.
While ONDC officials did not comment, sources said that the network always meant to bring in these caps, as the initial discounts were meant to attract consumers to the network.
ONDC, which has raised around Rs 180 crore from multiple institutions and banks such as
State Bank of India
,
Kotak Mahindra Bank
,
Axis Bank
,
HDFC Bank
, and
ICICI Bank
, has so far been funding these discounts.
ONDC has been offering multiple incentives to participants as it looks to boost participation.
ONDC has also been giving an incentive of Rs 50 to buyer-side apps such as
Paytm
and PIncode to offer a similar discount to consumers for orders above Rs 100. That had also been recently capped at 2,000 orders per day, as per sources. Separately, ONDC has also been giving multiple other incentives and rewards for boosting buyer-side demand and for onboarding of more merchants. These will gradually be phased out as the network reaches scale, sources indicated.
But the prices of food items on ONDC are still likely to be much lower, as seller apps are charging about 2%-3% commission to the restaurants, while the commissions on
Zomato
and Swiggy range from 20-30%.
The high commissions mean that restaurants hike their prices while listing their items on Swiggy and Zomato.

India
has a very bright future and that his company, the world’s largest retailer, is “hoping to be a part of this economy for decades and decades”.

Flipkart

PhonePe

About 20 years ago, McMillon’s responsibility was in merchandising and at that time India was considered to be a great opportunity from a sourcing point of view for Walmart’s other markets, within a very narrow set of categories.
“To be here today and to understand that India has these opportunities across so many categories is really exciting to me,” McMillon said.
What happens in India in the next 20 years is going to be remarkable, he said.

Walmart is building an ecosystem of suppliers and partners, including small and medium enterprises, to meet the company’s goal of sourcing $10 billion of India-made goods by 2027, he said.
“Walmart is committed to India and we are here for the long term. We are excited about the Indian suppliers and partners who make quality, affordable, and sustainable products for our customers and members around the world. We are proud that our business can support India’s growth by creating jobs, strengthening communities, and accelerating India’s progress as a manufacturing destination,” McMillon said.
Walmart’s leadership met a cross section of suppliers, merchants, grantees, artisans and MSMEs across its key India programmes and initiatives.
Walmart International
CEO
Judith McKenna
said the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit in India is more exciting than anywhere else around the world.
“This is a country that is forecasted to be the world's third largest economy by 2030, which is extraordinary. But what we see is much more than that,” McKenna said.
The entrepreneurial and innovative spirit is all about opportunity, she said.

ONDC faces roadblocks as snags slow ecommerce orders,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/ondc-yet-to-see-big-ecommerce-orders-ceo-says-traction-will-pick-up-in-coming-weeks/articleshow/100110054.cms,10-05-2023,"The government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (
ONDC
) is yet to show any significant traction for ecommerce orders, according to several industry sources, including sellers, network participants and ecommerce executives.
Electronics, fashion items, smartphones and others are considered broadly the key drivers of online sales across marketplaces. While ONDC, as a network, has scaled to about 20,000 daily orders from around 1,000 in March, 97-98% of the orders have been for hyperlocal deliveries of food and grocery. ONDC was launched in December 2021.
ONDC chief executive Thampy Koshy said the network, which started with food and grocery, added more categories and merchants only in the last few weeks. “Now that the other domains have been enabled, we expect them to pick up in the coming weeks,” he said when asked about the customer traction on the network.
Meanwhile, multiple network participants flagged snags in the system that was launched initially to counter the dominance of existing players, such as Amazon India and Walmart-owned Flipkart. From sellers not updating inventory listings and payment reconciliation issues to delivery frauds and logistical glitches, the ONDC network has witnessed roadblocks even as it spreads its presence across the country, three ecommerce executives aware of the matter said.
The executives, who are closely monitoring the ecommerce integrations on ONDC, said in recent weeks, order returns and rejections for online shopping through ONDC partners had been high. “Even while testing in closed user groups, sellers have not been prompt in resolving customer queries,” an ecommerce industry executive said.
Live Events
Ecommerce sellers said merchants were yet to track their listings and inventory situation on the ONDC network as sales were still low compared to food or grocery.
“Sellers, even with dedicated category managers in Flipkart, Amazon, need to be nudged when sales are happening. Lack of surge in sales has led to some of these issues,” said a senior online merchant who also sells on Amazon and Flipkart. According to him, unlike hyper-local deliveries, the ecommerce shopping cycle needs certain processes to be in place for a smooth consumer experience and that is still a work in progress.
ETtech
A report by customer engagement and user retention platform Clevertap on Tuesday about the overall food and ecommerce ecosystem pointed out that the average repeat transaction rate for new users was significantly higher for food-tech platforms when compared with ecommerce apps. “16% of new users of foodtech apps complete more than one transaction in the first week…(while) the average week 1 repeat purchase rate for an ecommerce app is 10%,” it noted.
Food and grocery delivery orders, which account for the biggest chunk of transactions on the network, have helped ONDC gain consumer attention. To ride this, large merchants like smartphone retailer Sangeetha Mobiles are expected to join ONDC soon. “These may give a much-needed boost to aspirations of truly disrupting ecommerce,” said one of the people aware of Sangeetha Mobiles’ integration on ONDC in the coming weeks.
People close to ONDC said they considered all its orders as “ecommerce”, including food and grocery.
""As of today, 97-98% of orders on ONDC are food and grocery. Other verticals which have been enabled in the protocol in the last few weeks include fashion, beauty and personal care (BPC), electronics, appliances and others. There are not many big merchants active in ONDC yet in non-food and non-grocery segments. There have been a number of transactions in home decor and BPC in the last few weeks,"" said Koshy, its CEO.
""Paytm, PhonePe and MagicPin have 90% of the market share on the buyer application. We started with food and grocery as it is the most demanding segment to fine tune the processes,” he said. “We are continuously adding more merchants across all domains that have been enabled.""
A top executive of a logistics company working with ONDC raised concerns of customer complaints arising for ecommerce deliveries.
“There is a trust issue that impacts customers, and most of the players in the ecommerce ecosystem from buyer-side platforms to last-mile logistics companies have been solving for frauds for over the last 10 years,” the executive said. “These problems include sellers sending a wrong or inferior product at times, or customers claiming to receive the wrong product despite being delivered the correct one,” this person said. “The feedback on these issues have been given to ONDC officials several months ago.”
ETtech
Food and grocery delivery is the low-hanging fruit and consumers are willing to try an order for Rs 350 instead of something priced at Rs 10,000 or more, a person aware of the ONDC network transactions and integrations said. “That level of ecommerce through ONDC is sometime away … There would be less than 500 orders a day now for ecommerce orders.”
Satish Meena, a senior ecommerce analyst, told ET that expanding into other categories like fashion and electronics that might not be purely hyperlocal could see several bottlenecks arising with elements such as warehousing and logistics coming into play.
“The problem with other categories like electronics, fashion, etc., is that behaviour needs to change, which takes time. Even ecommerce companies are still doing that,” Meena said. “Right now, the categories that are being serviced by ONDC have deliveries happening from within 4-5 km or maximum 10 km. Beyond that, several elements come into play. For intercity deliveries, for example, warehousing and logistics will need to be solved for. It takes time for the platform to stabilise because these things take time,” he added.
He explained that the processes for customer support would be key to gaining trust of consumers in case of cancellations, refunds, and even satisfactory deliveries of products — something that would translate to user retention and repeat purchases on the platform.
A report published earlier this month by McKinsey and ONDC
pegged that India’s digital consumption will hit $320-340 billion in size by FY30, compared to $60-70 billion in FY22
. Among the categories, fashion and lifestyle is expected to lead the charge, followed by electronics and durables, and grocery. “By 2030, ONDC could further accelerate the expected 5x growth in digital consumption of products and services,” the report noted.
ETtech
Last month, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said ecommerce platforms
that do not bring their main platform onto ONDC, and are instead building ONDC-specific platforms, should be removed from the network
.
“Because of this issue (building ONDC-specific platforms), not enough consumers are discovering existing merchants as well.,” a person closely associated with ONDC said.
ET reported in its May 8 edition that the dominance of
Zomato and Swiggy in the Indian food delivery space is under threat with a price war being triggered on ONDC.

The McKinsey-ONDC report also underscored the need for proactive complaint resolution and stringent policies to safeguard customer interests. “The willingness of consumers to use ONDC-linked buyer apps will depend on their experience with the network. A core characteristic of the open network is that it unbundles a series of services that would otherwise be unified on a single platform. Multiple participants deliver their respective components in the value chain,” it said.
“While allowing for individual margins and profitability, each of these participants needs to deliver to a high standard. One weak link in the entire chain, or one underperforming entity, can bring the customer experience crashing down,” the report added.
Anand Ramanathan, partner, Deloitte India, said while a network like ONDC would bring benefits of scale and access, bringing together of various platforms could pose a challenge. ""Ultimately, it’s a platform where buyers and sellers meet. It’s also useful from a customer convenience standpoint as it would help optimise across a wide portfolio of choices. The challenge is bringing all of this together and building the governance around the platform"".
""With a quasi-government body overlooking the operations, the ability to do certain kinds of financial arrangements for the companies is limited. For example, how would a loyalty programme work on ONDC is a question,"" he added.
Ramanathan also pointed out that customer service was dependent on a platform’s ability to deliver. ""If a customer is not happy with something they ordered on a platform, it rubs off on the platform. You go to any platform because you expect a certain level of service, convenience or price proposition. But if the solution provided by the platform fails, then whose responsibility it is and how much is a question that needs to be asked,"" he said.

FISME
) has suggested a green channel for e-commerce exports with easier documentation and tripartite awareness raising campaign, simplified customs processes and standard operating practice for product returns to promote
India
’s exports through e-commerce.
In a report it released with Delhi-based research and advisory firm
IKDHVAJ Advisers LLP
on Tuesday, FISME also stressed on a strategy for e-commerce exports focussing on MSMEs spread across the nation to sell their products to global
markets
as above 90% of e-commerce exporters in India are MSMEs, most of them micro and small enterprises.
“E-commerce exporters and within them particularly the MSMEs, face two types of concerns, those faced by conventional or offline exporters and others only by online exporters,” they said in a report titled ‘Expanding India’s E-Commerce Exports: Focus on SMEs’.
Shorter delivery time for e-commerce exports than conventional offline exports, higher extent of returns, returns being treated as imports due to problems in identifying the returned product as the originally exported product and being subject to full import duties leading to high
logistics
costs, and absence of single information source that provides a comprehensive and consistent list of all procedures/forms required for e-commerce exports, are some or the challenges faced by e-commerce exports, according to the report.
The two have suggested special facilitative mechanisms on cross-border payments especially with respect to closure procedure at banks besides lowering charges for

“Exploring closed loop

mechanisms with countries with which India has initiated rupee payments,” FISME and IKDHVAJ Advisers LLP said.
Easier reconciliation of remittances for
export
receipts from abroad through a reassessment of the current 25% variation between exports and payments, and raising the 9-month limit on receiving payments for exports for e-commerce, are the other recommendations.

"Easy documentation, increasing awareness, role of post offices to help boost e-commerce exports: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/easy-documentation-increasing-awareness-role-of-post-offices-to-help-boost-e-commerce-exports-report/articleshow/100099447.cms,09-05-2023,"Steps such as increasing
awareness
, easier documentation, simplified customs processes and standard operating practice for product returns would help in promoting the country's exports through e-commerce medium, according to a report by industry body
FISME
. The other measures which would help the sector include lowering charges for
Export Data Processing and Monitoring System
(EDPMS); easier reconciliation of remittances for export receipts from abroad through a reassessment of the current 25 per cent variation between exports and payments; and raising the 9-month limit on receiving payments for exports for e-commerce.
Over 90 per cent of e-commerce exporters in India are
MSMEs
(most of them micro and small enterprises) and, therefore, a strategy for
e-commerce exports
must focus on MSMEs spread across the nation to sell their products to global markets, FISME said.
The FISME and IKDHVAJ Advisers LLP report has flagged a number of issues that need to be looked upon to promote exports through e-commerce medium.
At present, product returns are in general treated as imports (primarily because of problems in identifying the returned product as the originally exported product) and thus subject to full import duties, the report said, adding in many cases, the logistics costs of bringing returns back to India are very high and the products are either sold at a huge discount in the country exported to or discarded.
The process of e-commerce exports through courier services below a particular threshold also results in an inability to claim benefits for exports available to offline exports, it said.

It added that logistics issues related to courier/customs procedures, the limited number of foreign post offices, and the difficulty in tracking the last mile delivery are also problems more specific to e-commerce exports.
The report has suggested a tripartite awareness raising campaign involving industry and
SME
associations such as FISME, government and platform owners to facilitate information on end-to-end e-commerce export process.
It asked for a green channel for e-commerce exports with easier documentation and customs process simplification for timely delivery; and special facilitative mechanisms on cross-border payments especially with respect to closure procedure at banks.

Supreme Court stays CCI order for ₹202-cr penalty recoup from Amazon,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/sc-stays-cci-orderfor-202-cr-penalty-recoup-from-amazon/articleshow/100082143.cms,09-05-2023,"New Delhi: The
Supreme Court
on Monday stayed the
Competition Commission of India
's April 25 order for ₹202 crore penalty recovery imposed on
Amazon
for its 2019 purchase of a 49% stake in a
Future Group
entity.
While Amazon wanted stay on the recovery proceedings, Additional Solicitor General N Venkataraman, appearing for the Competition Commission told the apex court that the officers concerned had been advised appropriately about the pendency of the matter before the SC.
A Bench led by Justice Dinesh Maheshwari while taking note of the totality of the circumstances in the case said: ""It is considered appropriate and hence provided that no coercive steps shall be taken in relation to the notice dated April 25 against the appellant (Amazon) until the next date of hearing on July 17.
The CCI had on December 17, 2021, suspended its approval accorded more than two years back to the e-commerce firm to acquire a 49% stake in Future Coupons (FCPL), following a review of allegations of concealment of information while seeking regulatory nod for the deal.
The anti-trust regulator had also imposed a Rs 202 crore penalty for allegedly not being upfront about the actual scope and purpose of the deal.

Tata Starbucks eyeing strong growth,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/tata-starbucks-eyeing-strong-growth/articleshow/100057877.cms,08-05-2023,"Starbucks
, the world’s largest coffee chain, is aiming for double-digit sales growth and market-share gain in the country through menu innovations, the chief executive of its India operations told ET, unfazed by competition from newer entrants such as
Pret a Manger
,
Tim Hortons
and
Third Wave Coffee.
""You obviously need to be aware of competition and you cannot ignore them in an environment like ours,"" said Sushant Dash, CEO of
Tata Starbucks
, the joint venture that operates Starbucks in India. ""But what is more important is you do what you are good at, and if you do it consistently, doing it as per what the consumer requirements are, you will get your fair share. We don't need to worry about that as long as we appeal to the right audience, we do the right things and we have consumers.""
In FY23, Starbucks’ India sales crossed the Rs 1,000-crore sales mark for the first time since it set up shop in the country a decade ago. At Rs 1,087 crore, it was up 71% from FY22.
Last year also saw the company launch masala chai and filter coffee in India on a pilot basis. It revamped its menu to attract consumers with Indianised and more affordable options. The menu included street-style, freshly assembled sandwiches, milkshakes, bite-sized snacks and a smaller beverage cup. Starbucks has now rolled out the expanded menu option across the country.
""If you see our growth rates for the last two, three years, or even over 10 years, what we have managed to establish, we are confident and we will continue to innovate, and will continue to make changes as per consumer requirements,"" Dash told ET. “As long as we continue to do that, we are in a good place.”
Live Events
Starbucks, which started India operations in October 2012, also recorded the fastest store expansion last fiscal, adding 71 stores to take the overall door count to 341 now.
In 2022, Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons had opened its first outlet in India, with plans to have over 100 stores over the next three years.
Last month, British coffee and sandwich chain Pret A Manger launched its first India shop in Mumbai, as part of its franchise agreement with
Reliance Brands Limited
to launch up to 100 stores over the next five years.
Indian coffee chain Third Wave Coffee already has more than 90 stores operational in the country, half of which are in Bengaluru.
Consumers of global coffee chains, including Starbucks, are also attuned to a takeaway culture which helps them add margins at very little cost. In India, however, office-goers and students frequent cafes to relax and spend hours over coffee and snacks. Real estate costs in India are high, making it important for retailers to realise average price per square foot of space.
""In India, you don't just come for the coffee, you come for the ambience, you come for the connect,"" said Dash. “Delivery is a behaviour change that has happened because of Covid. We are nearly 35% on the same store basis compared to pre-Covid numbers in stores, but we still do the same delivery numbers, which is now 11-12% of the revenue.”

Aditya Birla Fashion to raise up to ₹800 crore for TCNS acquisition,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/aditya-birla-fashion-to-raise-up-to-800-crore-for-tcns-acquisition/articleshow/100057780.cms,08-05-2023,"Aditya Birla Fashion
& Retail (ABFRL) will raise ₹700-800 crore in debt to help fund the acquisition of
TCNS Clothing
, a top company official said.
""For funding, we probably need about ₹700 to 800 crore through external debt, which we will have to raise... The remaining ₹800 crore will be funded through internal accruals,"" Ashish Dikshit, managing director of ABFRL told ET. ""Our balance sheet is strong enough to raise that.""
On Friday, ABFRL had signed an agreement to buy 51% stake in
TCNS -
which owns women's
ethnic wear brands
such as W, Elleven and Aurelia - for ₹1,650 crore.
As part of the deal, ABFRL will make a conditional open offer to acquire up to 29% stake at ₹503 per share from public shareholders and acquire the remaining stake from the founder promoters to reach an overall shareholding of 51% in TCNS.
Post the transaction, TCNS will be merged with ABFRL and public shareholders of TCNS will receive 11 shares of ABFRL for every six shares that they hold in TCNS.

TCNS Clothing shares crash 19% as Aditya Birla Fashion to acquire majority stake
While the overall apparel market is largely unorganised, within the branded apparel space, retail share of women's wear is expected to increase to 35% by FY25 from 31% in FY20, according to a report by
Antique Stock Broking
.
Also, international retailers such as
Zara
and H&M are not present in women's ethnic wear, and having strong presence in this segment provides an advantage to Indian apparel retailers in the overall category.
""It is a very fragmented market if you look at mid to lower part of the market. But in the premium side, I don't see too many brands of large size,"" Dikshit said. ""Also, we have not just got a very strong asset in terms of the brand and distribution, we also got a management team which has consistently delivered over a long period of time.""

Aditya Birla Fashion to acquire 51% stake in TCNS Clothing for Rs 1,650 cr
TCNS had sales of Rs 896 crore during FY22 from 650 exclusive brand outlets and 2,300 large format store outlets.
With this acquisition, ABFRL's ethnic wear portfolio is expected to reach ₹5,000 crore in the next three years with TCNS contributing about ₹2,000 crore.
More than five years ago, ABFRL had segmented its business into six sub-categories - lifestyle,
Pantaloon
, athleisure, youth fashion, super premium, and ethnic. However, most brands are focused on western style clothing, a segment significantly smaller than the overall women's ethnic wear in the mass market.
In the ethnic segment, the company acquired Jaypore, a premium craft-based artisanal brand, and also invested in designer brands Shantanu & Nikhil, Tarun Tahiliani, Sabyasachi and Masaba.
""This acquisition gives us the number one platform, the market leader in the category and completes the journey that we started five years back when we started to put together, through a series of very carefully crafted partnerships and acquisitions and organic launches,"" Dikshit said. ""With this acquisition, I think our portfolio is now complete.""
The company's lifestyle division runs nearly 3,468 stores for brands including Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly and Peter England. In addition, department store chain Pantaloons has more than 400 stores, while the company also runs women's fashion brand Forever21.

Retail inflation in India expected to average at 5.2% in 2023: Emkay,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-inflation-in-india-expected-to-average-at-5-2-2023-emkay/articleshow/100010743.cms,05-05-2023,"Emkay
Institutional Equities, a part of Emkay Global Financial Services, expects
India
will likely witness a sub-five per cent inflation in the early part of 2023, with an average rate of Consumer Price Index at 5.2 per cent for the entire calendar year.
The
RBI
's monetary policy actions, forecast of a normal monsoon this year, and supply-side constraints getting addressed will help with ease in inflation in India, the research house Emkay said.
Lead Economist at Emkay Global Financial Services Madhavi Arora led a media roundtable around the outlook for the Indian economy, the next steps of the RBI, the impact of the
US Fed
hiking key interest rates, the Indian rupee, and the inflation trajectory in India.
""Retail inflation is likely to ease well below the 6 per cent aim of the central bank. The CPI inflation will likely slip below the 5 per cent level later this year and average 5.2 per cent for CY23,"" it said.
In India, headline consumer price index-based (CPI) inflation (or retail inflation) has gradually declined from its peak of 7.8 per cent in April 2022 to 5.7 per cent in March 2023.

Assuming an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) of USD 85 per barrel and a normal monsoon, CPI (or retail) inflation is projected to moderate to 5.2 per cent for 2023-24 in India as estimated by RBI in its April monetary policy meeting; with Q1 at 5.1 per cent; Q2 at 5.4 per cent; Q3 at 5.4 per cent; and Q4 at 5.2 per cent.
Under the flexible inflation targeting framework introduced in 2016, the RBI is deemed to have failed in managing price rise if the CPI-based inflation is outside the 2-6 per cent range for three quarters in a row.
India's retail inflation was above RBI's 6 per cent target for three consecutive quarters and had managed to fall back to the RBI's comfort zone only in November 2022.
On US Fed's possible stance, the research house Emkay said the US central bank is expected to remain ""static"" in the coming months and cutting rates by early next year. It also believes the US will face a ""moderate recession"" with a hard landing.
Emkay Global believes the fear that ""speed can kill"" has led to a dovish turn from a number of central banks in both developed and emerging markets.

Shifting from We to Me: Shopping becomes more individualistic across urban India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/shifting-from-we-to-me-shopping-becomes-more-individualistic-across-urban-india/articleshow/99946244.cms,03-05-2023,"Shopping
is becoming increasingly individualistic across urban
India
, with younger and more affluent consumers in bigger cities in particular choosing to make purchases alone rather than with their families or friends, said industry executives.
This discernible shift in
shopping behaviour
from a traditionally collective exercise can be attributed to the rise of
ecommerce
and
social media
, they said, along with financial independence at an early age for an increasing number of consumers.
Department store chain
Shoppers Stop
’s MD
Venugopal Nair
told analysts last week that there has been a decline in the number of people shopping with families and in groups and that there has been an increase in individual purchases. “We recognise the shift in trends and we continue to bring in
brands
which cater to that segment,” he said.
Social commentator Santosh Desai said there has been a shift in the way people are getting exposed to fashion influences or purchase decisions more at an individual level through social media on personal devices like mobile phones.
“There is a larger trend of people realising who they are as individuals and recognition of one’s own personalities, which is a distinct shift of the collective identity which they used to have in a country like India.

Demand
for Small Packs
This is a pan-India phenomenon but the reflection of this through individual shopping is more in urban India since consumers there have more means to buy,” said Desai, managing director, Futurebrands Consulting.
Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies said single-serve packs are selling more in markets where there is a higher proportion of younger professionals and high penetration of quick commerce.
“The touch and feel factor in purchasing appliances is reducing, especially among high-income consumers, who are either coming alone to buy or even ordering over the phone,” said Nilesh Gupta, director at electronics retail chain Vijay Sales. “This could be due to ecommerce. However, first-time buyers are still coming in groups.”
Youngsters are mostly shopping individually and the brands targeting them are doing very well, said Devaranjan Iyer, CEO of department store chain Lifestyle. “But families are also coming,” he said.
Shoppers Stop has four direct-to-consumer (D2C) fashion brands, which the company has identified as an area of future investment, and it is readying to launch a young streetwear D2C brand Break Bounce.
In FMCG and grocery, the demand for small packs is more in pockets where there is a larger population of young consumers, said B Krishna Rao, senior category head, Parle Products. “But they, too, occasionally buy large packs for get-togethers,” he said.
A Mondelez India spokesperson said the demand for specific packs depends on where they are purchased. “For example, we see family and multi packs do very well in organised trade, whereas we are seeing shares of single-serve packs high on quick commerce, which indicates that different consumption patterns exist across platforms,” said the spokesperson.

retail segments
during 2022-23 increased 34% compared to those in the pre-pandemic FY20, largely driven by quick-service restaurants, sporting goods and electronics, a report by
Retailers Association of India
(
RAI
) has said.
While the bulk of the growth was price-led, consumer demand across categories bounced back as per the report that surveyed top 100 retailers from modern retail across segments.
Retailers are cautious about sales growth in the next few months because around this time last year, pent-up demand had helped them increase revenues, and there has been a slight slowdown in recent months.
""Higher inflation in advanced economies and tightening financial conditions in India have had some impact on demand, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities,""
Venugopal G Nair
, managing director and chief executive officer of Shoppers Stop, said during the firm's FY23 analyst call. ""Last year, during these times, we were witnessing pent-up demand in March and April and that has been considerably moderated this year. This had impacted our sales in February and March. However, we have seen green shoots in April,"" he said Venugopal G Nair, managing director and chief executive officer of
Shoppers Stop
during FY 23 analyst call.
Retail businesses across regions showed growth in sales in FY23. East India reported 42% growth followed by the West (36%), North (32%) and South (27%), the RAI report said. In categories, furniture reported a growth of 34% while consumer durables and electronics grew by 37%. Food and grocery grew 29% and sports goods showed a growth of 41%.

""2023-24 would be seen by retailers with cautious optimism,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, chief executive officer of RAI. ""The true potential would only get realised if the economically lower income families too shop with optimism. For that, inflation has to be in check. Travel, health consciousness and occasion celebrations should keep the market buoyant. Rural consumption can be a challenge,"" he said.
According to RAI, 2022-23 was especially good for categories like athleisure, occasion wear, consumer durables and IT products.
While retailers who sold to high-end customers saw healthy growth, those who sell low price point items found it much tougher to grow their sales.
Phoenix Mills
, which has one of the largest portfolio of malls in the country, said retail consumption in FY23 was 133% of FY20.
For shopping malls, December 2022 was the best in a decade as the sales momentum from festive season continued. Electronic retail chains said growth was driven by televisions, premium smartphones, laptops and air-conditioners.
Leading electronic retail chain Vijay Sales director
Nilesh Gupta
said these categories drove sales along with a 5-10% price hike across categories.

"Fresh trouble for Blinkit as over 1,000 riders join rivals",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/trouble-mounts-for-blinkit-as-protesting-delivery-workers-join-rival-firms/articleshow/99717473.cms,24-04-2023,"About a thousand delivery executives of
Blinkit
in the national capital region (NCR) have joined rival quick-commerce operators like
Swiggy Instamart
, Zepto and BB Now in
protest
against a recent change in payout structure, industry executives told ET.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
Earlier this month, Zomato-owned Blinkit had announced that it would pay delivery executives a minimum of Rs 15 per trip with a distance-based component, moving away from a fixed Rs 25 per delivery and peak-hour incentive of Rs 7 per trip. Blinkit’s
delivery workers have been protesting against this change
, saying it reduces their earnings.
The protest had led to several dark stores, or micro warehouses, of Blinkit across
Delhi
, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad
being shut down for a few days
. Now, despite the company's efforts to resume operations, multiple dark stores in Delhi and Gurgaon remained unavailable to customers because of lack of sufficient delivery executives. Blinkit has around 200 of these warehouses in Delhi-NCR, from where it delivers goods to customers within a 2-3 km radius of each store.
“Blinkit had close to 3,000 delivery executives in Delhi-NCR on its platform prior to the strike. Around one-third of them have joined other platforms after a week of protesting,” a person aware of the development said. “It is difficult to pinpoint how many would be there with Blinkit now because the company has been signing on new delivery workers as well in the last week.”
Mohammed Zakir, an East Delhi-based delivery executive who was protesting against Blinkit’s change of payout structure, said he has started working with Zepto. “Some of our fellow workers who were protesting started delivering orders, and we could only be out of work for so many days. I have parents and siblings to take care of at home, who depend on my daily wage. We really hoped the company would go back on the old rate card,” he said.

ET’s email query to
Zomato
remained unanswered as of press time.
Last week, the company also circulated a special incentive-based rate card valid for 10 days for some stores in Delhi and Noida, which said delivery executives could earn between Rs 700 and Rs 1,200 on fulfilment of certain order milestones.
The same week, several Blinkit riders were also de-registered by the company. Delivery executives in Gurgaon and Delhi said they received a message on the Blinkit delivery partner app informing them that some stores were being shut because there had been no work in the last three-four days.
According to the message, the registration of the delivery executive with the platform was terminated.
The protest at Blinkit has also pushed up the delivery orders for its rivals. ET had reported on April 18 that Tata-owned
BigBasket
, Nexus Venture Partners-backed Zepto and Swiggy’s Instamart
saw a 25-50% surge in daily orders in the days following the protest
.
The protest had forced almost 100 Blinkit stores to down shutters temporarily. They, however, reopened last week.
“The protests by delivery workers were on expected lines, and the store managers were asked to shut down to maintain safety and security at the dark stores,” a Blinkit executive told ET on condition of anonymity.
On April 20, Zomato told the stock exchanges that
the recent disruption at Blinkit had a revenue impact of less than 1% on the quick-commerce unit
during the ongoing quarter. “We had to shut down some stores for a few days to ensure safety of our employees at stores and the delivery partners. Most of these stores have now resumed operations,” it had said.
ETMarkets Decoder: Why are Blinkit delivery partners on a strike?
If you are an avid Blinkit user, you must have seen this message while ordering from the app in the last 2-3 days. So what exactly happened? In today's video, we are going to explain all about the Blinkit issue.

This new venture will cater for both the toys brands - Hamleys and Rowan, which Reliance Retail owns, the sources added. Besides, Reliance Retail is a major player in the B2B toy segment, where it operates through Rowan.
Circle E Retail has a specialisation in toy manufacturing. It has a modern manufacturing unit in Haryana and has a licence to manufacture and distribute a wide range of toys.
An e-mail sent to Reliance regarding the development remained unanswered at the time of filing of the story.
Last year, Reliance Retail expanded its brand Rowan from the B2B wholesale to the normal retail market also. The idea was to tap the fast-growing affordable branded toy market with smaller shop floors.
Reliance Retail acquired Hamleys, the world's oldest toy retailer, in 2019. This was the first
acquisition
of a global retail brand by Reliance Retail.
Hamleys currently has a global footprint in over 15 countries. In India, Hamleys is the largest chain of toy stores operating 100+ stores in 36 cities . In June 2022,
Reliance Brands Ltd
(RBL), a unit of
RRVL
, announced a joint venture with Italian company Plastic Legno SPA and acquired a 40 per cent stake in the latter's toy manufacturing business in India.
With both brands in its portfolio, Reliance Retail
Ventures Ltd
(RRVL) is one of the leading toy distributors. Hamleys mainly operates in the premium space, while Rowan plays in the mid-premium and mass segment with its affordable offerings.
According to a joint report by industry body FICCI and KPMG, the Indian toy market was estimated to be around USD 1 billion in 2019-20 and is expected to double to USD 2 billion by 2024-25.

Under the proposed policy, a single window clearance mechanism for traders may be developed, besides a centralised and computerized inspection management system.
Commenting on the development, Confederation of All India Traders (
CAIT
) said the retail trade policy will certainly help the sector widen their business as it will have definite parameters and fundamentals within which the retail trade would be conducted.
Retail trade is the only vertical of the economy which does not have a policy so far, CAIT Secretary General
Praveen Khandelwal
said.
""Likewise, awarding an insurance scheme to traders will recognise their magnificent contribution to the national exchequer,"" he said.

, B Tech in electrical engineering, computer science, packaging, robotics, automation engineering, or bachelors in computer application - these are the backgrounds of most shop-floor employees of the two recently unveiled company-owned stores of

Some are even educated in foreign institutions like Cambridge or
Griffith University
, and then there are some expats managing the show who have been internally transferred from Apple store operations in
Europe
or the Middle East, reveals the LinkedIn accounts of several employees. And almost all are experienced!
In the not-so glamourous world of on-the-ground retail jobs in India, Apple seems to be charting a new course. Industry executives said Apple is paying packages of well over ₹1 lakh per month, which is more than 3-4 times the compensation in a similar role in other electronic stores.
Apple has hired over 170 employees to manage its two stores - called
Apple BKC
in Mumbai and
Apple Saket
in New Delhi - and have trained them to global customer service levels. The BKC store has employees who can speak 25 different languages, while the Saket one has employees from 18 states who collectively speak more than 15 languages.
Apple did not respond to queries for this story till Friday press time.

Analysts said Apple wanted to create the premium experience reflected in their hiring.
""It's the magic of Apple to pull talent which is why there are so many engineers and well qualified employees working there. It's there globally for Apple, and they can afford such employees. Also, retail is a good starting point for several global organisations before they move to higher roles which Apple can replicate in India,"" said industry researcher IDC India associate vice-president Navkendar Singh.
According to Apple's career page on its website, the company offers health and wellness medical plans, paid leaves, tuition expenses for educational courses, stock grants and discounts when purchasing Apple stock, and employee discount for Apple products to its retail employees.
ET spoke to some Apple retail employees who chose to remain anonymous.
""I had just submitted my resume on the website and got a call. Previously, I had the experience of sales so doing a job at store is not very different from what I was doing. But the brand value is huge and will help in my next job,"" said an employee.
Another employee said this is the first time he is interacting with customers. He said there was extensive training which helps him now.

) is gearing up for the next phase of growth and will be formally launched this year, an official said.
Earlier this week, commerce and industry minister
Piyush Goyal
had called a meeting to take stock of the progress on ONDC.
ONDC is an initiative of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. It allows a single platform to access all domains and enables buyers and sellers to be digitally visible and transact through an open network.
It has been touted as a unified payments interface-type protocol that would democratise the ecommerce businesses by onboarding millions of small retailers in the country.
“ONDC will bring about a complete transformation in the ecommerce sector, just like what
UPI
did to payment systems,”
Anurag Jain
, the outgoing secretary of Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, told ET. Jain was on Thursday appointed as the secretary for ministry of roads, transport and highways.

"Retail, consumer sector saw 55% decline in deal volumes during January-March 2023: Grant Thornton Bharat",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/retail-consumer-sector-saw-55-decline-in-deal-volumes-during-january-march-2023-grant-thornton-bharat/articleshow/99616243.cms,19-04-2023,"The retail and
consumer sector
saw a 55% decline in volumes and a 70% decline in deal values during January-March quarter over a year ago period, according to a latest report by
Grant Thornton Bharat
.
While the consumer segment saw 78 deals valuing $1.3 billion in the first quarter, there were only three high value deals of over $100 million each compared to a dozen such deals in 2022.
""The sector is expected to experience significant growth in the medium to long term. In the aftermath of the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in consumer behavior, with blurring lines between online and offline channels. With advancements in e-commerce and improved internet connectivity, various revenue streams have emerged, leading to increased investor confidence,"" Naveen Malpani, partner and consumer sector leader at Grant Thornton Bharat. ""On the domestic front, the sector is expected to remain resilient, aided by the sustained focus on capital and infrastructure spending by the Government as well.""
Even compared to the sequential October-December quarter, the first three months of 2023 calendar year recorded a 24% decline in
deal volumes
while values dropped by 35% on back of absence of big-ticket investment and non-disclosure of around 75% of M&A deals. In
fact
, about 63 deals came from the e-commerce segment in Q1 2023.
While e-commerce segment accounted for 50% of the deals volumes valuing $26 million, FMCG as a segment drove the values accounting for 44% across only four deals bringing the average ticket size up, largely due to Mitsubihi UFJ Financial’s minority stake acquisition in Bira91.

While many large economies have started witnessing an economic slump, India’s consumer sentiment has been all time high both in the urban and rural markets. The D2C segment in particular has grown at a CAGR of 35% despite headwinds, which is the highest across all sectors during this time.
""The desire for convenience, engagement and connectivity in mobile-first India has continued to prove that e-retail will only grow exponentially. Because of this, the target audience market is also continuing to grow as GenZs enter the workforce. The forecast that India’s online shoppers will be over half a billion by 2030 continues to look promising,"" said Chirag Taneja, co-founder, Gokwik.
Experts said it's crucial to consider the data in the context of the larger picture especially for a sector that has shown remarkable resilience even during the pandemic.
""This resilience has been driven by factors such as the country's large and growing middle class, increasing urbanization, and rising incomes, which have fueled consumption and demand for retail products and services,"" said
Prashant Narang
, cofounder,
Agility Ventures
. ""The decline could be an aberration caused by a spillover effect from an economic downturn in other parts of the world, rather than a reflection of the health of India's
retail sector
. The global economy has been experiencing some challenges, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and the resurgence of the pandemic in some parts of the world, which could have affected the retail and consumer sector in India.""

The ground floor of the store has all the devices -- iPhone, Mac, iPad, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple TV lineups, as well as accessories like AirTag lined up. The first floor is designed as a service centre to resolve customer grievances related to the products.
The tech giant founded by Steve Jobs claims that the Mumbai store in BKC is one of its most sustainable stores. It is designed to be one of the world's most energy-efficient Apple Store locations.
This comes as Apple celebrates more than 25 years in India. “India has such a beautiful culture and an incredible energy, and we’re excited to build on our long-standing history — supporting our customers, investing in local communities, and working together to build a better future with innovations that serve humanity,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO.
Operationally carbon neutral
The Mumbai store has a dedicated solar array and zero reliance on fossil fuels for store operations. The store is operationally carbon neutral, running on 100% renewable energy.
Reports say that Apple will pay
roughly ₹42 lakh per month for the retail store in Mumbai.
Apple BKC features a triangular handcrafted timber ceiling that extends beyond the glass façade to the underside of the exterior canopy, reflecting the unique geometry of the store.
Each tile is made from 408 pieces of timber, forming 31 modules per tile with 1,000 tiles that make up the ceiling. Upon entering the store, customers are greeted by two stone walls sourced from Rajasthan and a 14-meter-long stainless steel staircase connecting the ground level and the cantilevered mezzanine.
The specialist team is skilled in Apple products to help customers learn about products, different ways to pay and how to switch to iOS.
The store will offer a special ‘Today at Apple’ series -- “Mumbai Rising,” running from Tuesday, April 18 through the summer featuring local artists and creatives, with a team of over 100 ready to aid customers.
‘Today at Apple’ is a creative initiative offered online and in Apple's retail stores worldwide, offering free educational sessions on features of Apple products.
“At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do, and our teams are excited to celebrate this wonderful moment with them as we open our first retail store in India,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail.
“Apple BKC is a reflection of Mumbai’s vibrant culture and brings together the best of Apple in a beautiful, welcoming space for connection and community,” she added.
Apple began manufacturing iPhones in India in 2017, and since then, the company has worked with suppliers to assemble iPhone models and produce a growing number of components.

The sprawling two level store can be accessed from either end of Jio World Drive, though it is located at the far end from the main entrance. Mall executives said that there will be some arrangements in terms of setting up temporary dividers for customers to queue up on opening day.
“Those waiting overnight will have to wait at the far end entrance (which is closer to the Apple store) as the mall will be closed at night. There is a lot of space just outside the Apple end entrance for them to queue up and wait,” another executive at the mall said.
Being the corner store gives it prime location in terms of floor space and visibility from the adjoining main road, which is an arterial road for those entering or exiting BKC.
The store itself has glass shutters surrounding all three sides and in preparation for the launch, two sides of the glass façade have the phrase ‘Hello Mumbai’ printed on them in a colourful kitschy font.
While the Apple store itself was still getting finishing touches, there is palpable excitement among stores next door, some of whom expect footfalls to increase, owing to the Apple store.
“Over the past week, the activity has increased. Earlier it was just the people doing up the store interiors but in the last week, they started stocking up the store,” a sales executive at a store near the Apple outlet said.
The entrance closest to the Apple store has been made operational with valet parking services once the store’s location was confirmed, they added.
“We also expect to see some increase in footfalls since now more people will use the entrance on this end of the floor, and we will get more visibility among customers because of that,” an executive at a luxury brand store near the soon-to-be opened Apple store said.
The store has also piqued the interest of customers visiting the mall as many tried to sneak a
peek
in through the glass shutters. The store has high ceilings and potted plants at the periphery and the trademark Apple layout of devices on white tables.
Activity at the store peaked for a bit on Sunday when the shutters briefly opened to allow a team from the tech giant to take photos and videos of the store. Many customers at Jio World Drive walked up to the store entrance seeking entry, only to be told that the store would open to the public on Tuesday.
The opening of Apple's first physical retail store is expected to add to the momentum the brand has seen in India, where it has ramped up domestic manufacturing, and increased marketing and affordability initiatives to get higher volume share as well, said Prabhu Ram, head, industry intelligence group, CMR.
“Offline retail continues to be key in a large, diverse market like India, where consumers love to touch, feel and explore the products. Apple would seek to replicate the famed Apple retail experience – including, overall consumer experience, staff knowledge and expertise, and the service standards, amongst others - in India, and steer greater market growth in the years ahead,” he added.

Wage protests halt high-speed grocery deliveries at India's Zomato,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/wage-protests-halt-high-speed-grocery-deliveries-at-indias-zomato/articleshow/99498593.cms,14-04-2023,"Around 50 stores of Indian
food delivery
company
Zomato
's grocery unit
Blinkit
are shut as bike riders have stopped work in the latest protest to hit India's
gig economy
as employees push demands for better wages.
Zomato in an email said it had introduced a new structure for riders that compensates them based on their effort and was engaging with them to reopen the shut stores.
To take advantage of the trend for ""quick commerce"" that delivers goods within minutes to those in urgent need of supplies or just impulse shopping, Zomato last year bought Blinkit for $550 million.
Blinkit has around 400 stores in India, of which 50 were shut, mostly in and around New Delhi, on Friday, a source with direct knowledge said.
Videos on social media showed hundreds of Blinkit bike riders protesting and raising slogans against the introduction of a payment structure they say will reduce their per-order earnings. The Blinkit app on Friday showed several of its stores were ""temporarily unavailable"" in New Delhi.
Live Events
""We are concerned because of this. No deliveries are happening,"" Blinkit rider Ajay Kumar said.
At one Blinkit store in the Noida region near New Delhi, a security staff officer told Reuters no delivery riders had picked up orders since April 11 and the store was shut.
Blinkit competes with other big delivery firms, including top retailer Reliance-backed Dunzo, Tata's BigBasket and SoftBank-backed Swiggy in India's fast-growing grocery market.
Zomato's other food delivery services continued normally.

As per Section 12(1) of the Code, the CIRP shall be completed within a period of 180 days from the date of initiation. However, NCLT may grant a one-time extension of 90 days. The maximum time within which CIRP must be mandatorily completed, including any extension or litigation period, is 330 days.
Last week, FRL informed that they have received an Expression of Interest (EoI) from 49 players, including
Reliance
Retail,
Jindal Power Ltd and Adani Group
for acquiring the assets of FRL.
On March 23, 2023, the resolution professional (RP) of FRL invited new expressions of interest, where prospective buyers can bid for the debt-ridden firm ""as a going concern or individual cluster or a combination of clusters of its assets"", as it failed to attract a resolution plan in over four months.
Earlier, it had received EoI and finalised 11 prospective bidders, including Reliance and April Moon Retail, but could not get a resolution plan despite two extensions in the deadline for submissions.
The Committee of Creditors had provided two options in the EoI, for which the last date for submission was April 7, 2023.
In the first option, the Prospective Resolution Applicant (PRA) could bid for the
acquisition
of
Future Retail
as a whole, including its shareholding interest in its subsidiaries. While under the second option, Future Retail's business has been distributed in five clusters diving business, in which PRAs can bid for ""any individual cluster or any combination of clusters.""
As per the invitation, FRL currently has access to 302 leased retail stores spread across 23 states and Union Territories, consisting of 30 large format stores such as Big Bazaar and FBB stores and 272 small format stores.

French premium furniture maker Gautier to re-enter Indian market,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/french-premium-furniture-maker-gautier-to-re-enter-indian-market/articleshow/99466175.cms,13-04-2023,"French premium furniture maker
and retailer
Gautier
is going to re-enter India in its third such attempt, although this time it will go solo after it had exited the country twice earlier when it was operating through
joint venture
(JV).
The company will set up stores over 3,000-5,000 square feet across metroes and large cities, primarily in the South to begin with. While at present it will import all furniture from France, there are plans to set up a manufacturing line as the India business scales up.
“Gautier is re-entering India. While initially it is exploring franchisee routes to set up a couple of stores with local partners, eventually it may take the equity route. The brand is still strong in India. It will also directly sell online like
Ikea
and Apple does,” said Gaurav Marya, chairman and founder of
Franchise India Group
, a retail consultancy aiding
Gautier’s re-entry
.
India allows 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail through the automatic route for single brand retailers and manufacturers. World’s largest furniture retailer Ikea has operations in India through the FDI route, while Apple too is going to inaugurate two of its company-owned stores next week in India through the same route.
Gautier had originally entered India in late 90s through a collaboration with
K K Birla
group and had even set up a factory in the country. In 2003, the contract ended and Gautier exited India. In 2007, Gautier re-entered the country in partnership with Ebony Retail and both the companies had announced plans to invest Rs 120 crore together to set up 20 stores. However, this JV too failed.

“The JV route has its challenges which Gautier has realized. Hence, it is keen to go solo this time. Most premium homes in India have the brand and hence rebuilding the business will be relatively easy. Gautier has also been successful in the Gulf with most buyers are of Indian origin which attracted them for a re-entry,” said Marya.
Gautier in its latest entry will sell premium and bridge segment furniture and home décor. The size of the furniture and home décor market in India is around $25-billion, of which around 14-15% is organized.
Marya said India has become an attractive market for European companies with their overseas expansion and business hit due to the Russia-Ukraine war and recession in most European nations.

Offline retailers accuse OnePlus of price disparity with online,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/offline-retailers-accuse-oneplus-of-price-disparity-with-online/articleshow/99462703.cms,13-04-2023,"Mainline retailers have accused
OnePlus
of pricing disparity on its products across online and offline channels. A national retailer body said the
Chinese smartphone brand
has created supply shortages in mainline retail, favouring its exclusive stores,
large format retail
(LFR), and online channels.
“Eyewash supplies to retailers, supplies to selective exclusive stores, ample availability of products on online channels with exclusive offers, full page advertisements pushing customers to exclusive stores are a retail sabotage and anti-competitive move by the brand,” said
All India Mobile Retailers Association
(AIMRA) in a letter dated April 12 to the brand.
The issue pertains to OnePlus bundling a free pair of wireless earbuds with its latest smartphone launched in April. The bundling offer, according to AIMRA, is only available at the brand’s exclusive stores, online channels, and in a few LFRs.
The letter adds that the brand’s moves raises a question mark on its intent which is depriving customers from buying the products from their preferred channels at competitive prices, forcing them to divert to exclusive channels.
OnePlus was not immediately available for a comment on the matter.

has filed an application before National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai, seeking directions with respect to gaining access to the inaccessible stores and warehouses of FRL, and connected consequential reliefs, it said in a stock exchange filing.
The company's resolution professional also requested the bankruptcy court to exclude 90 days from the company’s corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) period.
The RP of the
Kishore Biyani
promoted defunct retailer has approached the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT

FRL's assets including unsold inventory and property are housed either at its own stores or third party warehouses, and are needed by the resolution professional of the retailer for valuation and accounting purposes.
Biyani’s flagship company FRL, which operates large format hypermarket Big bazaar, has been undergoing insolvency proceedings since last July, although it has failed to attract buyers. The company has admitted claims of Rs 19,185 crore from financial creditors.

About 49 companies including Adani,
Reliance
, London-based retailer WH Smith and Jindal Power are in the race to acquire FRL, it said on Monday. Future Retail's court-appointed resolution professional held a second round of expressions of interest since the first did not have enough participants.
Lenders of
Future Enterprises Ltd
(FEL) refrained from referring the company for a corporate insolvency process in the hope that Biyani would sell part of his stake in the insurance business by the end of this month and distribute the sale proceeds among lenders.
The trouble at
Future group
initially started with the nationwide lockdown in March 2020. Most of the malls where Future stores were located remained shut. Subsequently, it suffered another setback in April 2022 after it failed to clinch a Rs 24,713-crore deal with
Reliance Industries
to sell its retail and wholesale business in a slump sale.
Future’s deal with Reliance collapsed after secured lenders voted against the scheme of arrangement. Lenders said they did not receive any clarity on how much money they would get from Reliance after it took possession of more than 900 large-format Future Retail stores. Reliance took over these stores in a phased manner, beginning 2022, due to non-payment of rentals by Future Group.

Reliance Industries Ltd readies $2.4-3 billion InvIT for retail warehousing assets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-industries-ltd-readies-2-4-3-billion-invit-for-retail-warehousing-assets/articleshow/99419463.cms,12-04-2023,"Mukesh Ambani-led
Reliance Industries Ltd
(
RIL
) has initiated a process that could see the group unlock value in the backend
warehousing
and related logistics
assets
of its retail business, through an infrastructure investment trust (
InvIT
), said three people aware of the development.
Reliance
Retail Ltd
- the country's largest retailer by revenue, scale and profit - has already started laying the groundwork for the proposed InvIT of its warehousing assets, having registered a trust, Intelligent Supply Chain Infrastructure Trust, with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (
Sebi
) at the end of February. This trust will house the warehousing assets that the group plans to monetise, the sources said.
Reliance declined to comment.
Though preliminary in nature and with granular details still being worked out, the petchem-to-personal products conglomerate plans to structure the vehicle as a privately placed or listed InvIT and has begun work with its financial and legal advisors. Under Sebi norms, it will need at least five shareholders.
Apart from registering the trust,
Reliance
has set up Intelligent Supply Chain Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, which is likely to be involved in the management of the assets to be housed under the InvIT.
Live Events
Growing capacity
According to the memorandum of association of the company filed with the Registrar of Companies, it has been set up to construct, develop, acquire, provide, manage, carry on the business of storage, warehousing, supply chain, cold chain, logistics infrastructure and facilities.
As of December 31, last year, Reliance Retail had a warehousing portfolio of 33.6 million sq ft, show RIL's latest financial filings. Reliance Retail added 11.1 million sq ft space in FY22, increasing its warehousing space to 22.7 million sq. ft. In the last three years, the company's warehousing space has grown threefold. Reliance Retail increased its store count to 17,225 at the end of December 2022, up from 14,412 a year ago, with retail floor space crossing 60 million sq ft, up from 40.6 million sq ft at the end of FY22.
The value of the assets that could be transferred to the InvIT is $2.4-3 billion (Rs 20,000-25,000 crore), said one of the sources. More assets are likely to get added as they become operational.
The group has bought a majority stake in Addverb Technologies that provides warehouse automation solutions and robotic systems for automated material handling. It's been experimenting with 5G robots used for bagging lines to warehouse storage location logistics, a function that would otherwise require human control, as well as drones. The plan to monetise its warehousing and related logistics assets comes at a time when Reliance Retail has been aggressively growing its warehousing capacity.
The Rs 2,850-crore acquisition of Metro Cash & Carry India Pvt Ltd will help Reliance Retail
Ventures Ltd
(RRVL) expand its warehouse network for the B2B ecommerce JioMart Kirana as well as its B2C hypermart business, said consultants working with the group.
Reliance Retail
had its own cash & carry business, Reliance Market, before the Covid-19 outbreak. But these facilities were shut, converted into warehouses and fulfilment centres for supporting its kirana ecommerce business.
""Warehousing is emerging as the new asset class for InvITs,"" said an investment banker. ""A lot of capital has gone into building top-class warehousing space for industries such as retail, ecommerce, industrials, pharma etc. More warehousing InvITs are expected to come up, given the huge demand for warehousing space in a growing economy like India.""
Consolidation card
Reliance Retail's business is spread across grocery, consumer electronics, pharmacy, fashion and lifestyle, with brands such as Reliance Fresh, Reliance Digital, Trends and Ajio.com. It has also announced multiple new forays, such as FMCG, and entry into new verticals like beauty.
“The real value unlocking will happen once the company decides to do a similar InvIT for the store fronts,” said the banker. “They will wait for Nexus Malls to list for a valuation benchmark.”
Blackstone-sponsored Nexus Select Trust REIT, India’s maiden real estate investment trust with retail properties, is set to launch its initial public offering to raise over Rs 4,000 crore in the first week of May, ET reported on April 10.
Reliance Retail Ltd is a step-down subsidiary of RIL. RIL holds 85.06% of the subscribed equity shares of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) which in turn holds 99.93% of the subscribed equity shares of Reliance Retail Ltd ( RRL) Since its inception in 2006, Reliance Retail (including RRVL) has grown into India’s largest retail conglomerate.
If Reliance’s plans fructify, this will be the fourth such infrastructure trust from the group after its oil pipeline and Jio telecom towers. “The idea is similar to the pipeline and fibre optic cable InvITs,” said an executive. “It will consolidate all warehousing assets in the InvIT with one customer, that is Reliance Retail, a very strong counterparty, which has thousands of stores pan India and millions of customers.”
In 2020, RIL raised Rs 7,558 crore from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund for a 51% stake in Digital Fibre Infrastructure Trust, which was set up to monetise its fibre optic network assets.
In 2019, Reliance had monetised its gas pipeline network, East West Pipeline, in a Rs 13,000-crore sale to
India Infrastructure Trust
, an InvIT sponsored by Canadian investor Brookfield. The group also raised Rs 25,215 crore, via its telecom tower InvIT, from Brookfield and other investors in 2019.
An InvIT involves various entities, such as the sponsor, which sets up the trust and transfers the assets to the trust; the trustee, which holds the assets in the trust for the benefit of the shareholders; the investment manager, which decides on acquisitions, divestments and fundraising for the InvIT; and the project manager, which manages the day-to-day operations of the underlying assets.
InvITs have also been set up for other infrastructure assets, such as roads, renewable energy projects and power transmission lines.

Indian shoppers snap up premium products,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/indian-shoppers-snap-up-premium-products/articleshow/99129165.cms,31-03-2023,"Indians are buying more premium products, pushing up the average selling price (ASP) of several categories such as televisions, refrigerators, laptops, smartphones and shoes by up to 18% in the past one year.
While ASPs had gone up in 2020 and 2021 as well, that was driven by both price increases and premiumisation. But now, with prices remaining stable for the past six months, an increasing shift towards premium products is solely driving ASPs, industry executives said. The strong ASP growth has come even as sales of entry- to mid-level segment products, which contribute 70-80% to total sales in their categories, are still to reach pre-pandemic levels.
As per the latest numbers from market researcher
GfK India
, the ASP increased 9% for laptops, 4% for
TVs
and 4-6% for appliances in 2022 compared with the year before.
For smartphones, the average price was up 18% to a record $224, research firm
International Data Corporation
said, driven by strong sales of mid-premium and premium handsets. While the Indian smartphone market shrank 10% by the number of units sold in 2022, the mid-premium ($300-500) and premium ($500+) price segments grew 20% and 55%, respectively, it said.
Prices stabilised after the June quarter last year and the premium mix drove sales since, said
Godrej Appliances
business head Kamal Nandi, adding that the trend was continuing in 2023 as well. ""The striking feature since Covid has been recurrent price hikes and faster sales of the premium segment, while the mass segment has de-grown, pushing up ASPs,"" he said.

The move towards premiumisation continues to gain pace across consumer durables and home appliances against all odds, said GfK India's head of market intelligence Anant Jain.
""This indicates the shift towards aspirational buying enabled by the convenience and simplicity of feature-rich products.""
Even in apparel and fashion, there is a higher purchase preference towards premium products.
Shoemaker Bata India
, in an analysts call last month, said sales of sneakers with an ASP of ₹2,000, shoes sold under premium brands like
Hush Puppies
with an ASP of ₹4,000 and
Comfit
of about ₹2,100 were growing. In comparison, sales of products priced under ₹1,000 declined by ten percentage points in total sales in the December quarter.
""ASP sequentially as well as compared to last year is up by about 13% (in the December quarter). However, unlike, let's say, the first half of this (fiscal) year, it is all being driven by premiumisation and no sequential price increases that we have taken,"" Bata India chief executive Gunjan Shah told analysts.
Departmental store
Shoppers Stop
said its ASP went up by 10% last quarter.
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
said in a recent investor presentation that premium and luxury segments were outperforming, while the value segment ""faces headwinds in view of inflationary pressures"".
Several companies have also changed their product portfolio mix in the last two years with higher focus on premium products.
