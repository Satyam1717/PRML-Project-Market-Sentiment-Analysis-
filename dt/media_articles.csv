"Digital media overtakes TV in 2024, contributes 32 pc to overall revenue: FICCI-EY report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/digital-media-overtakes-tv-in-2024-contributes-32-pc-to-overall-revenue-ficci-ey-report/articleshow/119607470.cms,27-03-2025,"Digital media in India has overtaken traditional television in 2024, becoming the largest segment in the media & entertainment (M&E) sector, contributing an unprecedented 32 per cent to the overall revenues, according to the latest
FICCI-EY report
. Moreover, digital media is expected to be the first M&E segment to cross Rs 1 trillion in ad revenues in 2026, it said.
The Indian M&E sector is expected to grow at over 7 per cent in the next three years to cross Rs 3 lakh crore, it added.
The Indian Media and Entertainment (M&E) sector in 2024 reached a total valuation of Rs 2.5 lakh crore (USD 29.4 billion) and contributed 0.73 per cent to India's GDP in 2024.
""Looking ahead, the Indian M&E sector is expected to grow by 7.2 per cent in 2025, reaching Rs 2.7 trillion (USD 31.6 billion), and then expand at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7 per cent to reach Rs 3.1 trillion (USD 36.1 billion) by 2027,"" it said.
This growth trajectory is poised to be shaped by innovative business models, strategic alliances, and industry consolidation, as per the report titled, ""Shape the future: Indian media and entertainment is scripting a new story"".
Live Events
In 2024, India M&E sector had a growth of Rs 8,100 crore from the previous year, marking a 3.3 per cent increase.
However, in actual, ""Growth slowed down from 8.3 per cent in 2023, due to falling subscription revenues, and a global decline in Animation and VFX work outsourced to India,"" the report said.
Moreover, advertising revenues have also seen an impressive growth of 8.1 per cent.
This is predominantly led by performance advertising on digital platforms, including e-commerce websites, and a surge in demand for premium and digital out-of-home (OOH) media.
""This growth has been further bolstered by the resilience of print and radio retail advertising revenues. Digital media (17 per cent), live events (15 per cent), and OOH media (10 per cent) have been key drivers of growth,"" it added.
Commenting on the report, Chairman, FICCI, Media and Entertainment Committee Kevin Vaz, said, ""The
Indian media and entertainment industry
is at a defining moment, driven by rapid digital adoption and evolving consumer preferences. This transformation is unlocking immense opportunities for content creators, advertisers, and technology innovators across all segments of the M&E ecosystem.""

With recognition at prestigious platforms like Cannes and the Oscars, coupled with its growing status as a VFX powerhouse and IPL fever, India is now firmly positioned as a key player in the international media landscape.
According to Vaz, this growth is not just a matter of numbers; it's about the unique way India is developing its media ecosystem.
He noted that unlike many other markets, India has managed to thrive in an ""and"" environment, where both television and digital media grow side by side.
“What sets India apart is not just our growth, but the way we grow. We are not an ""OR"" market but an ""AND"" market—television and digital media are thriving together,” he said.

Television remains evergreen
Meanwhile, he also pointed out that television remains a dominant force, with household reach projected to grow from 190 million in 2024 to 214 million by 2026.
At the same time, digital platforms continue to soar, offering exciting opportunities for content creators and consumers alike. This balanced growth has set the country up for a dynamic media ecosystem that serves a wide array of audiences.
Vaz further said that one of the key drivers of this media revolution is sports, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL), which has become a major force in content consumption.
IPL cheers grow louder
The IPL has become a massive force, with its ever-growing popularity reaching new heights in 2024. For the first time in IPL history, the tournament set a record in its first three games. According to Broadcast Audience Research Council data for Male 15+ AB Urban, IPL 2025 achieved a remarkable 7.5 Television Rating (TVR), marking a 39% increase from the previous year.
Additionally, the T20 tournament's reach expanded by 14%, hitting 253 million viewers, while watch-time minutes skyrocketed by 22%, reaching an impressive 2,770 crore minutes.
This explosive growth in viewership showcases the IPL's growing influence, reinforcing its position as one of the biggest entertainment drivers in the Indian media landscape.
“Sports, especially the IPL, continues to drive content consumption, demonstrating the power of both TV and digital, reaching 525 million viewers on TV and 550-600 million on streaming platforms,” Vaz added.
This reflects the true power of both TV and digital media, demonstrating the expanding reach of sports in India’s media landscape and highlighting the growing influence of both platforms in a rapidly evolving entertainment ecosystem.
Looking ahead, India is on track to become the third-largest media and entertainment market by 2028, reflecting the immense content being produced and consumed in the country, according to Vaz.

JioHotstar crosses 100 million paid subscribers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/jiohotstar-crosses-100-million-paid-subscribers/articleshow/119585169.cms,27-03-2025,"JioStar-owned streaming platform
JioHotstar
has nearly doubled its paid subscriber base to over 100 million in under two months since its February 14 launch, following the merger of Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.
The subscriber base includes both direct subscribers and those acquired through telco bundle deals. At launch, JioHotstar had 50 million paid subscribers, in addition to 500 million users.
Last year, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani highlighted that JioCinema achieved the fastest growth in its category, surpassing 15 million paying subscribers in just 100 days.
Commenting on the milestone, Kiran Mani, CEO – Digital, JioHotstar, said, “We have always believed that world-class entertainment should be accessible to all, and crossing 100 million subscribers is a testament to that vision. This milestone underscores India's limitless potential and strengthens our commitment to pioneering category-first experiences at an unprecedented scale. As we continue to innovate and expand, our focus remains on shaping the future of streaming, driving accessibility, and unlocking infinite possibilities for a billion screens.”
JioStar, the newly formed joint venture from the Viacom18-Star India merger, launched JioHotstar on February 14, bringing together JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar. The platform offers 3 lakh hours of entertainment, spanning movies, TV shows, and Hollywood content.
Live Events
Catering to 1.4 billion Indians in 10 languages, JioHotstar boasts a vast content library featuring Hollywood giants like Disney, HBO, and Paramount. It also includes ‘Sparks,’ a section highlighting top digital creators.
JioHotstar is a major sports hub, streaming the IPL, ICC events, the Premier League, and more, with advanced features like 4K streaming, AI insights, and multi-angle viewing for an immersive experience.
Competing with Netflix and Prime Video, JioHotstar has recently signed telecom bundling deals with Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vi.
According to an FICCI-EY report, video OTT is projected to grow from 47 million households in 2024 to 65 million by 2027, with 144 million subscriptions, averaging approximately 2.2 subscriptions per household.
The report also noted that ISPs and telcos will increasingly bundle multiple OTT platforms, playing a role similar to DPOs in television. However, consumers must be given the choice to customise their OTT bundles.
It further stated that JioHotstar is likely to become the dominant “first subscription pack,” significantly contributing to market growth due to its extensive film library and premium sports content. Much will depend on its pricing strategy around the IPL.
Reliance Industries and Disney, the JV partners in the $8.5 billion JioStar, valued Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema higher than their linear TV business during the valuation exercise prior to the merger, which concluded on November 13.

Indian M&E industry grew 3.3% to reach Rs 2.5 lakh crore revenue in 2024: FICCI-EY report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/indian-me-industry-grew-3-3-to-reach-rs-2-5-lakh-crore-revenue-in-2024-ficci-ey-report/articleshow/119583017.cms,27-03-2025,"India's Media & Entertainment (M&E) sector reached a total size of
INR
2,50,000 crore in 2024, marking a 3.3% growth from the previous year.
Digital
media overtook television as the largest segment, growing 17% to INR 80,200 crore, contributing 32% of total M&E revenues.
According to the latest FICCI-EY report, Shape the Future: Indian Media and Entertainment is Scripting a New Story, the sector’s growth slowed from 8.3% in 2023 due to a decline in subscription revenues and reduced global demand for Animation and
VFX
outsourcing. In 2024, the industry contributed 0.73% to India's GDP.
Advertising revenues increased by 8.1%, led by performance-based digital advertising, a surge in e-commerce ad spending, and rising demand for premium and digital Out-of-Home (
OOH
) media. Print and radio retail advertising remained resilient, while live events grew by 15%, crossing the INR 10,000 crore mark for the first time. However, subscription revenues fell by 2% across television, print, film, and online gaming.
Kevin Vaz, Chairman of the
FICCI
Media & Entertainment Committee, said, ""The Indian media and entertainment industry is at a defining moment, driven by rapid digital adoption and evolving consumer preferences. This transformation is unlocking immense opportunities for content creators, advertisers, and technology innovators. With India’s media and entertainment market expected to surpass INR 3,00,000 crore by 2027, the future is brimming with untapped potential. FICCI remains committed to fostering collaboration and innovation to ensure that India’s M&E sector continues to thrive as a global powerhouse.""
Ashish Pherwani, Partner and Media & Entertainment Leader at
EY
India, said, ""The digital revolution has not only transformed how content is created and consumed but has also redefined the very essence of the M&E industry. From immersive storytelling and interactive experiences to innovative business models and strategic alliances, the landscape is continually reshaping itself. As digital media overtakes traditional mediums, we are witnessing a paradigm shift, where the value delivered across information, escapism, materialism, and self-actualisation becomes the new benchmark for success.""
Live Events
Jyoti Vij, Director General of FICCI, said, ""The FICCI-EY report reaffirms the resilience and dynamism of India’s Media & Entertainment sector, which continues to thrive despite global economic headwinds. The 8.1% rise in advertising revenues and the exponential growth of digital media underscore India’s leadership in content creation and consumption. As the industry undergoes rapid transformation, FICCI remains steadfast in driving policy reforms, fostering strategic collaborations, and shaping a future-ready ecosystem that not only fuels sustainable growth but also strengthens India’s global influence in the M&E landscape.""
The report highlights several key trends within the industry. Digital advertising grew 17% to INR 70,000 crore, accounting for 55% of total advertising revenues. This growth was led by short-form video, social media advertising, and a 50% increase in e-commerce advertising, which reached INR 14,700 crore. Spends by SMEs and long-tail advertisers contributed INR 25,800 crore to digital advertising.
The digital subscription market grew by 15% to INR 10,200 crore, with paid video subscriptions reaching 111 million across 47 million households. Paid music subscriptions increased from 7 million to 10.5 million, while news subscriptions remained at 3.1 million.
Live events saw a 15% rise in revenues, supported by increased spending on government and election-related events, personal celebrations, and ticketed concerts featuring international acts.
Out-of-Home (OOH) media expanded by 10%, with premium properties and locations driving growth. Digital OOH surged by 78%, increasing its share of total segment revenues from 7% in 2023 to 12% in 2024.
Radio revenues grew by 9% to INR 2,500 crore, bolstered by an increase in advertising volumes and alternative revenue streams. Around 20% of radio revenues now come from events, content production, and other non-traditional sources.
Print advertising revenues rose by 1%, although subscription revenues declined by 1%. Digital revenues remained relatively small, accounting for less than 5% of total print revenues.
The music segment experienced a 2% revenue decline due to industry efforts to curb free music consumption and lower streaming royalty rates. However, paid subscriptions increased, reaching 10.5 million. Growth was limited by the popularity of free alternatives such as YouTube and radio.
Online gaming revenue fell by 2%, impacted by the imposition of a 28%
Goods and Services Tax
(GST) on deposits and the rise of illegal offshore platforms. Transaction-based gaming saw a 6% decline in net revenues, while casual and free-to-play gaming grew by 16%.
Despite the release of over 1,600 films in 2024, the film sector saw a 5% drop in revenues. Theatrical admissions declined, and only 11 Hindi films grossed over INR 1,000 crore, down from 17 in 2023. The value of digital and satellite rights also fell by 10%, as broadcasters and OTT platforms prioritised profitability.
Linear television revenues declined for the second consecutive year, with a 6% drop in advertising revenues and a 3% decline in subscriptions. Pay TV households decreased by six million, while
Free TV
and Connected TV households increased. Weekly active Connected TV viewers rose from 23 million in 2023 to 30 million in 2024.
The Animation and VFX sector experienced a 9% revenue decline, primarily due to the Hollywood writers' strike and financial struggles faced by international studios. Reduced advertising revenues also affected the production of animated content in India.
Looking ahead, the FICCI-EY report projects that the Indian M&E sector will grow by 7.2% in 2025, reaching INR 2,70,000 crore (US$31.6 billion), and will continue to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 7%, reaching INR 3,10,000 crore (US$36.1 billion) by 2027.
The industry is expected to focus on increasing subscription revenues, monetising content intellectual property, and consolidating within key segments. The export of Indian content and services is also set to grow, reinforcing India’s position as a global content powerhouse.
Artificial intelligence will play a crucial role in enhancing efficiencies across content production, distribution, and personalisation, while also improving operational efficiencies.
The online gaming sector may continue to struggle unless regulatory measures are introduced to curb illegal offshore platforms. Indian companies may seek to expand into foreign markets with more favourable regulatory environments.

Hathway Digital
and
DEN Networks
have launched new channels dedicated to short-form video content, bringing the popular social media format to

screens.
This move comes as short-video consumption continues to surge, with platforms like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts dominating
digital entertainment
.
Industry experts note that cable television faces growing competition from digital platforms, which have significantly transformed viewing habits.
With Hathway Reels and DEN Reels, the companies aim to integrate
influencer-driven content
into traditional TV, creating a new space for both creators and audiences.
Hathway Reels and DEN Reels allow users to submit short videos showcasing talents such as dancing, singing, acting, and comedy.

Selected videos will be broadcast on the channels, providing individuals with an opportunity to appear on television.
Market analysts suggest that this initiative could help cable networks engage younger audiences, who have increasingly shifted towards on-demand and social media platforms.
By featuring
user-generated content
, Hathway and DEN are testing a new content model that blends traditional broadcasting with digital trends.
Experts, however, note that short-form content thrives on social media due to personalisation and interactivity. It remains to be seen how well this format will adapt to television, which operates differently.
The success of these new channels will depend on viewer engagement and advertiser interest, according to industry experts. While digital platforms use algorithms to personalise content for users, cable TV follows a scheduled programming format.

"Not just IPL players, TV viewership's in top form too",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/not-just-ipl-players-tv-viewerships-in-top-form-too/articleshow/119553527.cms,27-03-2025,"The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 delivered its biggest-ever opening weekend on television other than the strong Covid-19 years, setting new viewership records for the first three games.
According to Broadcast Audience Research Council data for Male 15+ AB Urban,
IPL 2025
achieved a record 7.5 Television Rating (TVR), scoring a 39% rise from last year. The T20 tournament’s reach grew by 14% to 253 million, while watch-time minutes surged by 22% to 2,770 crore.
The
Chennai Super Kings
vs
Mumbai Indians
clash became the most-watched IPL match ever on TV, with a 9.2 TVR and 163 million live viewers. TVR is a mix of reach and viewer time spent.
The opening weekend attracted 137 crore views on JioHotstar. Across TV and digital, the total consumption stood at 5,000 crore minutes.
Live Events
""This opening weekend of IPL was the biggest ever in its history. It is driven by a deep commitment to delivering immersive engagement and intuitive experiences, at an unprecedented scale. Sports fan experiences are fast heading towards a hyper-personalised future, the playbook for which is being written in India,"" said Sanjog Gupta, CEO-Sports,
JioStar
, at a US-India Business Council event on Tuesday.
Experts attributed the strong viewership in this year’s edition of the IPL to JioHotstar’s shift from a fully-free model to a hybrid approach, JioStar’s extensive network, recent rise in pay-TV households, and growing penetration of sports channels.
Sports viewership has increasingly adopted a hybrid model due to the rapid rise in digital streaming, which continues to see steady growth, they added.
JioStar, which is broadcasting and streaming IPL matches across TV and digital platforms, aims to attract 1 billion viewers this year. This will mark a sharp increase from IPL 2024’s 541 million TV viewers.
LV Krishnan, CEO, TAM Media highlighted that the hybrid model for live sports has significantly boosted
TV viewership
. ""The viewership growth can also be attributed to the network power of JioStar, as IPL matches are airing across 26 channels spanning sports and entertainment,"" he said.
Krishnan noted that transitioning to a paid streaming model has had a cascading effect on pay-TV net additions. In 2023 and 2024, JioCinema offered IPL streaming free of cost to all internet users.
Beyond record-breaking viewership, the tournament has also contributed to pay-TV growth by curbing subscriber churn and driving net additions. Industry sources report a net gain of 800,000 to 1 million pay-TV subscribers due to the IPL, reinforcing the role of major sporting events in expanding the pay-TV universe.
""With cricket going behind the paywall, the churn in the pay-TV industry has halted to a large extent. IPL is expected to boost the pay-TV base since it's a two-month event,” said Manoj Dobhal, CEO,
Dish TV India
. “Broadcasters should put their premium content behind the paywall. While this move will help the industry, the broadcasters will be the biggest gainers.”
IPL 2025 is the first edition since the merger of Disney's Star India and Reliance’s Viacom18 to form JioStar. The consolidation of IPL media rights under JioStar has strengthened monetisation opportunities.
JioStar is targeting Rs 4,500 crore in ad revenues from both TV and digital, with over 30 sponsors and 1,100 advertisers on board. It also expects IPL to boost pay-TV subscriptions by 1.5 million to 2 million at the industry level and expand JioHotstar’s subscriber base from 62 million to 100 million during the tournament across direct subscriptions and telco bundled deals.
A media buyer said there is good momentum around the IPL, something which was not visible during the ICC Champions Trophy. ""IPL CTV inventory is sold out while some linear TV inventory is still left,"" he added.

"Panel wants IT, I&B Ministries and DoT under one umbrella",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/panel-wants-it-ib-ministries-and-dot-under-one-umbrella/articleshow/119432071.cms,24-03-2025,"The Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology has proposed bringing the ministries of electronics and IT (MeitY), information and broadcating (MIB) and
department of telecommunications
under a single umbrella to improve coordination in addressing issues related to
technology convergence
of communication and media technologies.
The recommendation was made to the MIB as part of the parliamentary panel’s Demands for Grants report for 2025-26, which was presented in the Lok Sabha on Friday and in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.
“If need be, the ministry (MIB) may also look into the feasibility of bringing” the MeitY, MIB and the telecom department (DoT) “under one umbrella for better coordination for issues emerging due to the convergence of technologies,” the report said.
The media industry is undergoing a significant transformation, with the widespread adoption of smartphones and affordable high-speed mobile broadband boosting
online media consumption
.
Live Events
However, the committee’s proposal is expected to face a pushback from the
broadcasting industry
, industry insiders said.
Industry bodies such as the
Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation
(IBDF) have previously informed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) during consultations that broadcasting services are fundamentally different from utility-based telecommunication services in their constitutional positioning.
While telecommunications infrastructure can justifiably be subject to licensing as a scarce public resource, “creation and dissemination of broadcasting content are exercises of fundamental rights,” IBDF had argued.
The standing committee has also urged the MIB to consider introducing a comprehensive media bill to address concerns related to broadcasting, cable TV, and over-the-top (OTT) platforms, especially since the MIB is planning to bring a new broadcast bill.
The draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, which aims to replace the existing Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, will not be introduced in the current session, the MIB informed the panel.
The committee also asked the ministry to explore the feasibility of constituting a media council covering print, digital, and broadcasting under one umbrella for better coordination and law enforcement. It suggested that inputs from related ministries and organisations, including the MeitY, be sought.
The idea of a media council is not new. The Press Council of India has also supported it.
However, the MIB has previously expressed reservations, arguing that different media platforms are too unique to be governed under a single regulatory framework.
The ministry withdrew the draft broadcast bill last year due to significant criticism from stakeholders.
The bill, intended to overhaul broadcasting regulations, was placed in the public domain on November 10, 2023, for public and stakeholder feedback. It faced backlash for potentially expanding government control over online content, including social media and independent content creators.
The bill aims to streamline regulatory processes, extend its purview to OTT content and digital news, introduce contemporary definitions for emerging technologies, and strengthen self-regulation through a Broadcast Advisory Council for content oversight, besides improving existing broadcasting laws, as per the ministry.
While recommending that the MIB conduct a comprehensive review and incorporate stakeholder suggestions, the parliamentary panel stressed that the bill must be holistic, robust, and technology-proof.
It also suggested including a provision for periodic reviews and updates to keep the legislation relevant as technologies and trends evolve in the broadcasting sector.

Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
(MIB) to strengthen regulations concerning
films and audio-visual content
that glorify alcohol, drugs, and violence.
In its
Demands for Grants
2025-26 report, the committee has expressed concerns about the impact of songs and clips that glorify alcohol, drugs, and violence on vulnerable audiences, particularly children and young adults.
In light of these concerns, the committee has recommended the formulation of a comprehensive policy framework to strengthen existing guidelines and ensure strict compliance with court directives regarding content that promotes harmful substances.
It has suggested the need for a stronger code of ethics to prevent such glorification in media, drawing inspiration from the Punjab and Haryana High Court ruling that banned a song glorifying alcohol, drugs, and violence and directed authorities to take action against the culprits.
The advisory issued by the MIB on November 26, 2024, concerning streaming content on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, should be periodically reviewed and updated to align with evolving content trends, the committee said.

To ensure effective implementation, the committee has urged coordination with state governments and law enforcement agencies. It has also stressed the importance of
public awareness initiatives
to educate people about their rights and the mechanisms available for reporting content that violates ethical standards.
Additionally, the committee has called for engagement with stakeholders in the music, film, and entertainment industries to promote responsible content creation and discourage the glorification of alcohol, drugs, and violence.

ensures such songs and content are not approved for public exhibition.
However, the committee said it is concerned that promotional clips of films and songs still reach audiences through live performances and digital platforms.
The committee also highlighted existing guidelines, which include the IT Rules, 2021, under which films or serials portraying the misuse of psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking, and tobacco are classified under a higher category.
The Cinematograph Act, 1952, prohibits the justification or glorification of alcohol and drug use in films, while the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994, prohibit the broadcast of films, songs, trailers, and music videos unless certified by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) as suitable for unrestricted public exhibition.

"IPL 2025 eyes record ₹4,500 crore in ad revenue as JioStar secures 32 sponsors",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-2025-eyes-record-4500-crore-in-ad-revenue-as-jiostar-secures-32-sponsors/articleshow/119315687.cms,23-03-2025,"The
Indian Premier League 2025
, which kicks off on Saturday, is set to establish new benchmarks in terms of
advertising revenue
with broadcaster
JioStar
targeting a record Rs 4,500 crore, having already secured 32
sponsorship deals
with many more in the final stages, people familiar with the matter said.
Simultaneously, the company aims to boost its paid
streaming subscribers
to 100 million through direct sign-ups and telecom-bundled deals, they added. It is also eyeing a bump up in the industry pay-TV base due to the switch to hybrid streaming model for cricket and aggressive seeding of Star Sports in the TV universe.
As the first IPL following the high-profile merger of
Star India
and Viacom18, it has signed major sponsors across TV and digital, including My11Circle, Birla Opus,
SBI
, PhonePe, Mutual Funds Sahi Hai, Britannia 50-50, Haier,
Voltas
, MRF, Amazon Prime, Thums Up, Google Search, Jaquar Bath + Light, Lays, Allen Solly, GPay, Kent Kuhl Fans, Dream11, Campa, TVS,
Asian Paints
,
Maruti
, CaratLane and Amul.
Last year, the cumulative ad revenue on TV and digital was roughly Rs 4,000 crore.
Overall, the network has onboarded 1,100 advertisers, including large brands and small and medium enterprises. This year, JioStar has aggressively targeted SMEs, many of which typically advertise on Google and Meta.
Live Events
IPL ad packages for TV range from Rs 40 crore to Rs 240 crore. For regional partners, the packages are as low as Rs 16 crore. For Connected TV (CTV), it is Rs 8.5 lakh per 10 seconds and Rs 250 cost per impression on mobile.
JioStar is looking to add 40 million paid subscribers for
JioHotstar
during the IPL through both direct sign-ups and telecom partnerships to take its base to 100 million. Formed after the merger of Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema, the streaming platform currently has 62 million subscribers, up from 50 million at launch of the merged platform on February 14.
""IPL 2025 will be the biggest edition not just in terms of advertising but also subscriptions,"" said JioStar chief executive - sports, Sanjog Gupta, without sharing any specific details. He added that big-screen advertising inventory is nearing a sell-out across both linear TV and Connected TV.
JioStar has set an ambitious target of engaging one billion viewers for IPL 2025 across TV and digital. Gupta dismissed concerns over declining
pay-TV subscriptions
and the absence of fully free sports content on digital platforms, citing the record-breaking viewership of the
ICC Champions Trophy 2025
across both mediums.
""The reason why
sports viewership
is rising despite challenges in the pay-TV sector is the significant growth in sports channel penetration since April 2014, when we embarked on this journey to expand sports viewership,"" he said. The network expects to add between 1.5 million and 2 million net paid TV subscribers during the IPL, he said.
As per Broadcast Audience Research Council data, the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 outperformed the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 by 23%. JioHotstar set a new record in India’s live sports streaming with the tournament, drawing more than 5.4 billion views and nearly 110 billion minutes of watch time.
""JioHotstar recorded a peak concurrency of 61.2 million for the ICC Champions Trophy final despite the shift to a hybrid model,"" he said, downplaying fears of a potential drop in reach on mobile.
While Gupta declined to disclose specific figures, media buyers estimate that IPL ad deals have already exceeded Rs 3,500 crore, with further agreements expected in the run-up to the tournament due to strong demand across multiple categories.
""The recent raids on media agencies will not have any major impact on IPL advertising deals,"" said the CEO of a media buying agency, adding that IPL consistently attracts strong advertiser interest due to its stable viewership, making it one of the most valuable media assets.
Industry sources suggest that JioHotstar has partnered with Jio, Airtel and Vi to introduce bundled offers, ensuring that millions of subscribers gain access to JioHotstar without needing a direct subscription.
In terms of content strategy, JioStar has segmented audiences into multiple cohorts, including male, female and children. The platform will also continue its regional language feeds on both TV and digital to enhance viewership in regional markets besides strengthening them in Hindi markets.
Additionally, it is launching six free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channels dedicated to sub-IPL communities, such as Mumbai Indians or Chennai Super Kings fans, as well as individual player fanbases like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma supporters.
JioStar will also collaborate with the cricket board on the Fan Park initiative, covering 50 cities across 23 states over 10 weekends. IPL chairman Arun Singh Dhumal highlighted the importance of Fan Parks in bringing the tournament closer to fans across India.
The IPL Fan Parks will feature live match screenings, music, entertainment, food courts, children's play area and interactive activities such as a virtual batting zone, bowling nets, face-painting stalls, replica dugouts, a cheer-o-meter and photo booths.
On the tech innovations, Gupta said JioHotstar's MaxView feature is being refreshed with a more interactive experience during the IPL. Previously, it was a one-way viewing experience designed for vertical screens. Now, users can swipe to navigate key moments in live streaming, making it more intuitive.
Additionally, Gupta said that the six new FAST channels being introduced for CTV aim to provide a more seamless, lean-back experience.
Instead of navigating through various content sections, fans can access a dedicated channel for their favourite team and continuously watch, similar to traditional linear TV, he said, adding, this aims to enhance engagement and simplify content discovery on big screens.

CCI cleared seven M&A deals in media sector over past five years: I&B ministry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/cci-cleared-seven-ma-deals-in-media-sector-over-past-five-years-ib-ministry/articleshow/119267662.cms,20-03-2025,"The Competition Commission of India (
CCI
) approved seven M&A deals in the media and entertainment sector over the past five years while ensuring competition safeguards, minister of state for information and broadcasting B L Murugan told the Lok Sabha on Thursday.
Though the minister did not disclose the approved M&A deals, some key transactions cleared by the CCI in recent years include the $8.5 billion Disney-Reliance media merger (2024), Comcast Corporation's investment in Bodhi Tree Systems, which in turn invested ?4,306 crore in Viacom18 (2023), Tata Sons’ increased stake in Tata Play (2025) and
Bharti Airtel
’s buyback of 20% in Bharti Telemedia from Warburg Pincus (2021).
""With a view to promote and sustain competition in markets, CCI approves mergers and acquisitions with suitable remedies on a case-to-case basis,"" Murugan said in the Lok Sabha.
The Reliance-Disney merger to combine Star India and Viacom18 assets closed on November 14. The merged entity, JioStar, valued at $8.5 billion, will be controlled by RIL with a 56% stake, while Disney will retain 37% and Bodhi Tree Systems will hold 7%.
Before this, Viacom18 secured a ?15,145 crore cash infusion following a strategic transaction between RIL, Bodhi Tree Systems and Paramount Global. RIL invested ?10,839 crore, while Bodhi Tree Systems—a platform of James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems and Uday Shankar—contributed ?4,306 crore.
Live Events
In the direct-to-home (DTH) segment, Tata Sons acquired an additional 10% stake in Tata Play from Temasek-owned Baytree Investments for $100 million, valuing the company at $1 billion. This raised Tata Sons’ stake in Tata Play to 70%, with Walt Disney holding the remaining 30%.
In 2021, Bharti Airtel acquired an additional 20% stake in Bharti Telemedia from Lion Meadow Investment Limited (LMIL), an affiliate of PE firm Warburg Pincus, for ?3,126 crore. The acquisition, partly through issuing 36.47 million equity shares at ?600 per share in Bharti Airtel and ?1,037.8 crore in cash, gave Airtel full ownership of Bharti Telemedia, valuing the company at ?15,630 crore.
Murugan also said that under the Policy Guidelines for Uplinking and Downlinking of Television Channels, 2022, 109 private satellite TV channels have been transferred in the last five years.
""The relevant orders including those from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the Competition Commission of India are taken into consideration while processing the applications for transfer, merger, acquisitions, etc.,"" he noted.
To regulate content, Murugan highlighted that the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and its 2021 amendment mandate private satellite TV channels and cable networks to comply with the programme and advertising codes.
Similarly, print media must adhere to the Press Council of India’s (PCI) ‘Norms of Journalistic Conduct’, which restrict fake, defamatory, or misleading news. PCI investigates violations and takes action as necessary.
Digital news publishers must follow the IT Rules, 2021, under the IT Act, 2000, ensuring compliance with PCI norms and the programme code. These regulations collectively aim to uphold responsible content standards across TV, print and digital media.

IPL
fever gripping the country,
JioStar
is set to launch the second edition of
Brand Spotlight
, an advertising initiative designed to dominate the ""golden window"" of the tournament’s first six overs. This strategy will ensure maximum visibility for select brands at a time when audience engagement is at its highest.
For the first time, this ad slot will extend beyond digital platforms to linear TV, giving sponsors access to unmatched viewership during the
IPL opener
on
Star Sports
. Some of the top brands securing these high-impact slots include My11Circle, Campa Energy, GPay, Birla Opus, Poker Baazi, PhonePe, Sprite, Dream 11, TVS,
Asian Paints
,
MRF
, Joy Consumer Products, and CaratLane.
JioStar believes Brand Spotlight is setting a new standard for premium advertising in India, creating an IPL equivalent of the Super Bowl’s iconic ad slots.
“The opening match at IPL is a marquee moment in India’s sporting calendar, commanding unmatched audience attention. Brand Spotlight places brands at the centre of this excitement, providing a one-of-a-kind platform to engage millions at scale,” said Ishan Chatterjee, Chief Business Officer - Sports Revenue, SMB and Creator, JioStar. “At JioStar, we are offering exclusive opportunities across TV and digital, enabling advertisers to turn campaigns into cultural moments that resonate far beyond the first ball.”

The dawn raids were conducted at various offices of the media agencies in Delhi-NCR and Mumbai that started from Tuesday early morning and ended on Wednesday early morning, the source aware of the development said on Tuesday.
A query sent to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) seeking comments on the raids did not elicit any response.

"CCI raids on global media giants GroupM, Publicis, Dentsu ran through the night while IPL countdown starts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/cci-raids-on-global-media-giants-groupm-publicis-dentsu-ran-through-the-night-while-ipl-countdown-starts/articleshow/119199784.cms,19-03-2025,"India's antitrust officers grilled media executives and seized data in an investigation into price fixing by global advertising agencies
GroupM
, Interpublic, Publicis and
Dentsu
, with raids continuing well past midnight into a second day on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.
The
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) raids began early morning on Tuesday at around 10 locations in the strictest enforcement action ever against media agencies and a group of the nation's top broadcasters, just before the start of the popular IPL cricket tournament, the biggest sporting event for advertisers in India.
Top officials at the Indian office of GroupM were not allowed to go home overnight and the raid was still continuing on Wednesday, with evidence from mobile phones being cloned, two people with direct knowledge said.
Raids at Indian offices of U.S.-based Interpublic's IPG Mediabrands unit, Japan's Dentsu and top broadcasters industry group IBDF ended early morning on Wednesday, nearly 24 hours after they started, people familiar with the matter said.
At the New Delhi IBDF office raid, CCI inspectors reviewed emails related to advertising dealings of the group, which represents billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
's Reliance-Disney joint venture and Sony, said the first source.
Live Events
France's
Publicis Groupe
office was also raided on Tuesday and the operation continued well past midnight, though it wasn't clear if it has ended, said another source familiar with the operation.
GroupM, owned by Britain's WPP, did not respond to Reuters queries. WPP in 2023 said it had a 45% media market share in India, with 45 of the top 50 advertisers as clients.
Interpublic's IPG Mediabrands unit, Publicis, Dentsu and the IBDF did not respond to Reuters queries. The CCI also did not respond.
The raids come amid major shifts in India's ad landscape following a $8.5 billion merger between Walt Disney and
Reliance
's India media assets, which is estimated to have a 40% share of the ad market in TV and streaming segments.
The media agencies compete in India, the world's eighth-biggest ad market, where revenues of $18.5 billion last year are set to grow 9.4% in 2025, GroupM estimates.
In a case started last year, the CCI is investigating allegations that broadcasters and media agencies were colluding on prices and discounts of ad rates. The raids were carried out in New Delhi, Mumbai and Gurugram, Reuters has reported.
The watchdog does not provide details of price collusion cases, or make its investigations public, and the case is likely to drag on for months before a conclusion is reached.
If found guilty, the media agencies may be liable to pay a penalty amounting to up to three times their profit for each year during which the collusion took place, or 10% of their turnover for each year of wrongdoing, whichever is higher.

Bollywood producers go regional to beat box office blues,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/bollywood-producers-go-regional-to-beat-bo-blues/articleshow/119129303.cms,18-03-2025,"Mumbai: Prominent Hindi film studios are moving into making
regional language films
as they look to break the dry spell caused by funding constraints, high costs and low confidence in starting fresh films. In the last one month,
Dharma Productions
,
Luv Films
,
Baweja Studios
, and Junglee Pictures are among the production houses that have announced films in Punjabi, Marathi, Tamil and Malayalam.
Dharma Productions announced a Punjabi film 'Akaal' with actor Gippy Grewal, while Junglee Pictures announced its Malayalam foray with the film 'Ronth' (night patrol).
""The Hindi film industry is in a flux. Big films and stars are unable to draw audiences to theatres. It will take at least twelve to fifteen months to deal with these challenges,"" said Naveen Chandra, founder and CEO of 91 Film Studios, a production house that makes, finances and distributes regional films. ""In the interim period, Hindi film production houses are experimenting with a few regional films.""
After Covid, repeated failures of big-budget Hindi films have forced the industry to reassess. Similar challenges persisted even for mid-sized Hindi films as audience's interest in these films waned.
A key parameter which works in favour of regional film is the turnaround time. ""The turnaround time for regional films is faster than mid-sized Hindi films,"" said Chandra. ""Generally, it takes 8-12 months to make a regional film, whereas a mid-sized Hindi film takes 1-2 years.""
Live Events
In recent years, mid-sized Hindi films have been taking longer to complete production as actors associated with them are committed to web series, endorsements and events, too. Due to this, producers said, these actors have not reduced their remuneration even after their films have failed in the box-office, making the economics of mid-budget films unfavourable. As per producers, regional films are a more viable proposition. A regional film can be made for '2.5-15 crore, whereas a mid-sized Hindi film would require '15-30 crore. Also, regional films require a considerably low investment of '50 lakh to '2 crore for promotion and advertising. For mid-sized Hindi films, this would be '5-15 crore.
Performance of regional films in recent years has also been encouraging, thanks to their engaging and rooted-in-culture stories. According to media and entertainment research firm Ormax Media, in the January-February 2025 period, regional films accounted for 52% of the total box office of Indian films, while Hindi films accounted for 45%.
Producer Anand Pandit, known for regional films in Marathi and Gujarati, said, ""Today, viewers have a greater connection with regional films, as these films are largely based on original stories. A Hindi film which does an average business has an occupancy rate of 10-15% in theatres. But a regional film which does an average business has an occupancy rate of more than 25%.""
Another aspect which works in favour of regional films is intellectual property (IP). Producers shared that it is easier to create IP in regional films given their sharp and defined demographics.
Suniel Wadhwa, co-founder and director of Karmic Films, said, ""A prominent Hindi production house enhances the production value of a regional film. But recovery of investments (sale of satellite and digital rights) will depend purely on the quality of storytelling and unique content.""

With this approval, Torrent Group has taken majority ownership of Irelia Sports India, which owns Gujarat Titans, by acquiring the stake from Irelia Company Pte Ltd, a CVC-controlled entity.
On February 12, Torrent and Irelia announced definitive agreements for the transaction, pending BCCI and Competition Commission of India (CCI) approval and other closing conditions. As part of the deal, Irelia, managed by funds advised by CVC, will retain a 33% minority stake.
The CCI had approved the transaction on February 20. This is the first
majority stake sale
by an IPL owner since the world’s richest cricket tournament began in 2008.
Torrent Group, a diversified conglomerate with interests in pharmaceuticals and energy, stated that Gujarat Titans will now benefit from its expertise in managing large-scale businesses. The acquisition is expected to enhance team operations, fan engagement, and commercial growth.
Live Events
ET first reported Torrent Group's interest on 13th September 2024 and the deal's completion on 11th February 2025.
While financial terms remain undisclosed, sources estimate Gujarat Titans' valuation at ₹7,500 crore, placing the 67% stake’s worth at ₹5,025 crore. As part of the transaction, BCCI will receive ₹251 crore, equivalent to 5% of the deal value.
CVC originally acquired the franchise in 2021 for ₹5,625 crore, payable over a ten-year period.
Industry sources had earlier told ET that Torrent’s investment in Gujarat Titans is the beginning of a larger sports strategy, with the group eyeing cricket franchises in England, Australia, and South Africa, along with potential expansion into non-cricket sports in India.
The acquisition concludes a four-year wait for Ahmedabad-based Torrent Group, which had lost the Ahmedabad franchise to CVC in 2021 with a ₹4,653 crore bid. Adani Group, which had bid ₹5,100 crore, was also in the race for Gujarat Titans before withdrawing.
The IPL remains the world’s most valuable cricket league, with a cumulative brand value of $12 billion, according to Brand Finance. Gujarat Titans' brand value stood at $69 million.
Financial data from Tofler shows that Gujarat Titans, which posted a ₹429 crore loss in FY23, reduced its losses to ₹57 crore in FY24. The franchise led revenue charts with ₹776 crore, a 116% increase from ₹359 crore in FY23.

The acquisition raised Bharti Airtel’s stake in Bharti Telemedia from 80% to full ownership, valuing the DTH company at Rs 15,630 crore.
Tata Play is also in discussions with Bharti Airtel to merge their DTH businesses. In a regulatory filing, Bharti Airtel confirmed that both companies are engaged in bilateral talks to explore a potential combination of Tata Play and Airtel's DTH arm, Bharti Telemedia, in a mutually agreeable structure.
While Airtel emphasised that discussions are ongoing, sources had informed ET that the merger is likely to be executed through a share-swap arrangement, making Airtel the majority
stakeholder
with over 50% of the combined entity.
Both companies are expected to finalise a heads of terms agreement soon, kickstarting the
due diligence
process. Post-merger, Airtel is projected to hold 52-55% of the new entity, while Tata Play’s stakeholders, including Walt Disney, would retain 45-48%.
The new company is likely to be led by Airtel’s senior management, with Tata seeking two board seats. Industry sources estimate the combined valuation of both DTH businesses at approximately Rs 6,000-7,000 crore.

TV broadcasters’ margins set to expand 300 bps to 15% by FY27 driven by digital growth: Crisil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tv-broadcasters-margins-set-to-expand-300-bps-to-15-by-fy27-driven-by-digital-growth-crisil/articleshow/119112902.cms,17-03-2025,"The operating margins of
TV broadcasters
are expected to rise by 300 basis points (bps) to 15% by fiscal 2027, driven by increasing digital offerings that enhance economies of scale, according to a Crisil Ratings analysis covering broadcasters that contribute to 90% of industry revenue.
While this growth will bring profitability closer to pre-pandemic levels, the long-term success of TV broadcasters will depend on their ability to compete with digital platforms amid evolving consumer preferences, the rating agency noted.
Improved profitability is projected to boost returns on capital to 10-12% by FY27, strengthening credit profiles. However, this remains lower than the pre-pandemic levels of 12-15% and significantly below the peak of 15% seen over the past two decades.
TV broadcast revenue remained largely stagnant between FY22 and FY25 as more consumers shifted to digital content, including over-the-top (OTT) platforms on TV and mobile, as well as
social media
platforms like YouTube and Instagram.
This trend is expected to persist, driven by increasing broadband and internet penetration, alongside digital media’s advantages such as on-demand content availability and interactive engagement. As a result, revenue from traditional linear broadcasting is expected to remain stable or see a slight decline.
Live Events
To capitalise on the digital shift, broadcasters have launched their own digital platforms, offering content such as live sports and news. This expansion into digital is also enabling them to tap into higher
advertisement revenues
from key sectors like fast-moving consumer goods, automobiles, e-commerce, and real estate.

advertising
industry has increasingly leaned towards digital due to shifting consumer habits and the ability of digital platforms to deliver targeted, data-driven advertisements. Meanwhile, rising subscription revenues have further supported broadcasters, who compete with OTTs and digital-only platforms for content acquisition and subscription income. Many platforms are placing content behind paywalls while optimising content acquisition costs and boosting ad revenues.
Ankit Hakhu, Director, Crisil Ratings noted, “As a result, digital revenues of these broadcasters grew 15% on average over fiscals 2022-2025 and will continue to grow at double-digits over the next two fiscals. With the linear broadcasting segment nearly flat, this will increase the revenue contribution of digital to 25% by fiscal 2027.”
With digital revenues rising and contributing more to overall earnings, broadcasters are seeing improved profitability. Since digital platforms do not significantly alter fixed costs, they offer an opportunity to monetize content more effectively.
Varun Marwaha, Associate Director, Crisil Ratings added, “Ability to utilise their content for digital offerings is leading to amortisation of content cost over a wider consumer base and economies of scale in operating costs. As a result, the operating margins of broadcasters are expected to inch closer to the pre-Covid level of 16-18% over the next two years.”

JioStar likely to remove entertainment content from YouTube from May 1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/jiostar-likely-to-remove-entertainment-content-from-youtube-from-may-1/articleshow/118990458.cms,14-03-2025,"JioStar is likely to remove its entertainment content from the Google-owned video streaming platform
YouTube
as part of its strategy to curb subscriber migration from linear TV to free digital streaming, sources familiar with the matter told ET.
The company may implement this from May 1 but it has not yet taken a final decision, they added.
This will be the second significant decision by the company, which was formed through the merger of
Disney's Star India
with
Reliance Industries
' Viacom18.
The move follows the company's decision to place content behind a paywall on JioHotstar after offering premium content, including sports, for free for two years prior to the merger—a strategy that had impacted both pay-TV and subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services.
Pay-TV distribution platforms such as Tata Play, Airtel Digital TV and
GTPL Hathway
have been urging pay-channel broadcasters like JioStar,
Zee Entertainment
and Sony Pictures Networks India to remove their content from advertising-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) platforms, including YouTube, which are drawing subscribers away from pay-TV.
Live Events
With pay-TV subscriptions declining to 84 million paying homes, the broadcasting industry has been exploring ways to reduce churn and grow its paid subscriber base. The TV subscription market is estimated at Rs 40,000 crore, according to a Ficci-EY report.
""We have been actively pushing for the removal of pay content from AVOD platforms. Broadcasters have now recognised that supplying premium content to these platforms ultimately harms the pay-TV industry,"" said a senior executive from a leading TV distribution platform, adding that other broadcasters may follow suit.
However, a top executive from a rival network said the company has yet to make a decision on removing content from AVOD platforms. ""Putting pay content on YouTube, which is a free platform, is a big mistake on the part of pay-TV channels,"" he added.
JioStar’s free-to-air (FTA) Hindi GECs, Colors Rishtey and Star Utsav, which are set to launch on DD Free Dish in April, will also implement a one-year content windowing policy. This means that fresh content from Star Plus or Colors will only become available to Star Utsav and Colors Rishtey audiences a year after its premiere.
Additionally, the company will launch a campaign on its FTA channels to encourage DD Free Dish users to switch to pay-TV. With 40-50 million households relying on DD Free Dish, the platform has significantly impacted the pay-TV subscriber base.
In an interview with ET last year, JioStar vice-chairman Uday Shankar stated that when an industry leader takes bold steps that resonate with consumers, others tend to follow—highlighting JioStar's influential position.
""With 90 million pay-TV homes and 125-135 million families watching TV daily, it’s clear that TV is far from dead. On the other side, the streaming business offers immense growth potential, with 700-750 million people using mobile phones and consuming data in some form,"" he had said.
JioStar recently organised a closed-door event attended by top CEOs of pay-TV platforms, along with the company's senior management. The primary focus of the discussion was revitalising the pay-TV industry and expanding the subscription base to ensure benefits for all stakeholders in the value chain.

Panel urges MIB to set deadline for introducing Broadcasting Services Bill,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/panel-urges-mib-to-set-deadline-for-introducing-broadcasting-services-bill/articleshow/118988361.cms,13-03-2025,"The Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology has urged the
ministry of information and broadcasting
(MIB) to set a deadline for completing the process and introducing the Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill in Parliament at the earliest.
The committee made this recommendation in its action taken report on its observations and recommendations from the 56th report on the Regulation of Cable Television in India.
The second draft of the Broadcast Bill, introduced in July, was withdrawn in August last year following backlash from media industry stakeholders over the lack of transparency in consultations, which were held with only a select group.
Another major concern was that the bill contained vague terms that could potentially grant arbitrary powers to government officials.
In its response to the committee, the MIB stated that a fresh draft of the bill would be published after detailed consultations.
Live Events
The ministry explained that once consultations with stakeholders are completed, it will prepare a draft Cabinet Note, which will be circulated for inter-ministerial consultation. Following this, the draft bill will be submitted for the Cabinet's consideration.
""This process is expected to take some time. The committee will be duly informed about the progress of this process,"" the MIB stated in its response to the committee, which had earlier recommended that the government expedite the formulation of the law while ensuring adequate consultations with stakeholders.
The draft Broadcast Bill 2023 was placed in public domain on November 10, 2023, inviting views, comments and suggestions from the general public and stakeholders until December 9, 2023. The deadline was later extended to January 15, 2024.

The combined workforce of the two companies exceeds 6,000 employees across TV, digital and sports verticals. Linear TV is expected to see redundancies in sales, marketing, programming and distribution.
The two companies have significant overlap in sports and digital, as Star had a larger presence in these segments, while Viacom18 had been aggressively hiring since entering the sports space in 2021 and revamping its digital business by merging Voot with JioCinema.
""While there are job duplications in linear TV, significant overlaps exist in digital and sports, as Star already had large teams in these areas, while Viacom18 aggressively expanded these segments over the past two years and was on a hiring spree,"" said a source close to the development.
Star India's employee benefit expense stood at Rs 1,412 crore in FY24, up from Rs 1,316 crore a year ago. Viacom18's employee benefit expense was Rs 512 crore in FY24, compared to Rs 469 crore in the previous year.
In an interview with ET last year, JioStar vice-chairperson Uday Shankar had stated that the company would handle the headcount rationalisation process thoughtfully and transparently.
""Wherever there’s more than one person for the same role, we will first look to find them another meaningful position within the organisation. However, in some cases, there may be redundancies. You know both sides are very familiar with each other. It's a small ecosystem,"" he had said.

Digital-first media firms outperform traditional rivals amid slowdown,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/digital-first-media-firms-outperform-traditional-rivals-amid-slowdown/articleshow/118768230.cms,07-03-2025,"Investors have shown more confidence in
entertainment companies
with a strong digital presence during the recent market downturn, while stocks of companies more reliant on traditional media have dropped significantly more during the same period.
Shares of companies like
Saregama India
, Tips India, and Signpost India—firms that generate a significant portion of their revenue from digital platforms—have declined by less than 20%.
In contrast, stocks of companies more dependent on traditional media, such as
PVR Inox
,
UFO Moviez
,
Dish TV
,
Pritish Nandy Communications
,
Den Networks
,
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
, and
Shemaroo Entertainment
, have fallen between 30% and 60%. These firms, focused on film, television, and theatrical exhibition, have been hit harder since the market's bearish phase began in late September 2024.
Since the last week of September, the Nifty 50 index has fallen 13.8%.
Beyond the broader market’s pessimism, industry-specific challenges have also played a role in deepening the decline in entertainment stocks. Changing content consumption patterns—such as the shift to streaming and digital platforms—poor box-office performance, muted advertising growth, and cord-cutting have all impacted revenue growth. These trends have led investors to favor companies with a stronger digital presence.
Live Events
Vaibhav Muley, lead analyst for the media and entertainment sector at Yes Securities, said, ""Structurally, the entire consumption pattern in India's media and entertainment sector is shifting toward the digital landscape. Revenue growth in digital advertising and subscriptions is increasing.""
""I see fundamentals favoring the digital landscape across segments. Consequently, investors have shown a clear preference for stocks of entertainment companies with a strong presence in digital media. A case in point is music companies,"" he added.
Digital revenues and subscribers across the industry are expected to grow significantly over the next two years.
According to the FICCI-EY 2024 Media and Entertainment sector report, revenues from digital advertising are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% between 2024 and 2026, reaching Rs 84,200 crore. This will increase digital advertising’s share of total advertising revenue to 57% in 2026, up from 51% in 2023.
According to Ormax Media’s OTT Audience report, India's digital video universe grew by 13.8% between 2023 and 2024, reaching 54.73 crore users. The number of paid subscribers for music
streaming platforms
is estimated to grow from 7-8 million in 2024 to 15 million in 2026. Given these favorable fundamentals, investor interest has been increasing in stocks of companies with a higher degree of digital presence.
Harssh K. Shah, mid- and small-cap analyst at Dalal & Broacha Stock Broking, said, ""A fundamental issue for entertainment companies dependent on traditional revenue models is their future growth. Content consumption patterns have changed drastically.""
""Post-pandemic, muted advertising growth is hurting television companies, while viewers increasingly prefer streaming platforms, impacting theater footfalls. This has slowed the growth of multiplexes, which continue to struggle with high fixed costs,"" he added.
Analysts believe investors will continue to reward entertainment companies with strong digital presence, given their increasing investments in digital platforms.

Ad rates for Champions Trophy final surge with India's entry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ad-rates-for-champions-trophy-final-surge-with-indias-entry/articleshow/118768140.cms,07-03-2025,"Mumbai: Buoyed by India's qualification for the
ICC Champions Trophy final
, broadcaster JioStar is seeking up to Rs 35 lakh per 10-second spot for the remaining unsold inventory on linear TV for the match scheduled for March 9, according to media buyers.
The ICC Champions Trophy has attracted 204 million viewers aged two years and above (MF 2+) for 10 matches, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) data. Two matches were abandoned without a ball being bowled, while another was called off after rain interrupted play.
The
India vs Pakistan match
clocked 154 million viewers for the MF 2+ age group. The game had set a new
digital viewership record
, amassing 602 million views on JioHotstar, the streaming platform formed by the merger of Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.
For the Male 15+ ABC TG category, the tournament attracted 82 million viewers for the 10 games and 64 million for the India vs Pakistan match.
India will take on New Zealand in what will be its third consecutive ICC trophy final after the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, which it won to end its 11-year drought of ICC trophies.
Live Events
Before the tournament began, the broadcaster had set a TV spot rate of Rs 28 lakh per 10-second slot for India matches.
Additionally, JioStar is now aiming for Rs 20 lakh per 10-second spot for the connected TV (CTV) inventory, marking an increase from the previous Rs 15 lakh where the TV sets access and play content via the internet.
JioStar declined to comment.
A dozen new brands are expected to join the roster for the final match, in addition to the existing advertisers, said people in the know.
One of the people said there is growing interest in the final, with existing sponsors increasing their investment and new brands eager to capitalise on the demand.
IPG Mediabrands chief investment officer Hema Malik said India's strong performance is a significant advantage amid a soft ad market, especially since the tournament precedes the Indian Premier League.
""JioStar still has some ad inventory left and is seeking a premium for the unsold spots,"" she said.
The CEO of a media buying firm noted that while the broadcaster has quoted Rs 35 lakh per spot for TV and Rs 20 lakh per spot for CTV, it is open to negotiations. ""They are even willing to close deals at Rs 25 lakh per spot for TV. CTV inventory will see strong demand since it offers premium audiences,"" he added.
While the company had set an internal target of Rs 1,500 crore in ad revenue from the ICC Champions Trophy, it may ultimately generate around Rs 850 crore from the tournament, media buyers note.

New compliance burdens could disrupt Indian music industry: Survey,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/new-compliance-burdens-could-disrupt-indian-music-industry-survey/articleshow/118735720.cms,05-03-2025,"A study by public policy think tank The Dialogue reveals that Indian musicians are deeply concerned about potential new regulatory compliance requirements, with nearly three-fourths (72%) of surveyed artists fearing that such regulations could disrupt music output or delay releases.
The report also highlights that 77% of respondents worry global collaborations may become more challenging under these regulations. While the second version of the Broadcast Bill was withdrawn in August last year, speculation remains that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) may introduce a new version to bring digital platforms including OTT audio streaming under a regulatory framework.
As the industry already complies with the IT Rules 2021 for digital content governance, artists caution against additional regulatory layers that could stifle growth.
Titled Tuning into Change: Empirical Insights into India's Evolving Music Industry, this peer-reviewed study surveyed 1,200 Indian artists, shedding light on India’s booming music creator economy, cultural diplomacy, and the rise of regional talent. It also identifies structural challenges and policy recommendations for long-term sustainability.
A significant 82% of respondents believe that new compliance measures—such as pre-release scrutiny or alignment with prescribed standards—could limit musical diversity and stifle creative uniqueness. The overwhelming sentiment in the industry underscores the need for a flexible, balanced framework that nurtures artistic innovation.
Live Events
Kazim Rizvi, Founder of The Dialogue, said India is experiencing an unprecedented musical renaissance. ""The challenge now is to implement frameworks that protect and empower while ensuring compliance without compromising the dynamism that defines today's Indian music industry,"" he added.
The study further reveals that 80% of artists anticipate financial strain from compliance costs if pre-release scrutiny is mandated for online music streaming. Additionally, 75% fear operational complexities that could hinder creative expression.
Strategic interventions could fuel industry expansion, the study suggests. While 51% of musicians stress the need to lower entry barriers and improve access to streaming platforms, 48% highlight infrastructure gaps in India’s live music ecosystem, pointing to investment opportunities in performance venues and technical enablers.
With 46 crore daily streams and projected industry revenues of Rs 3,700 crore by 2026, Indian music is at a pivotal moment. Digital platforms account for 87% of revenues, driven by millions of paid subscribers. India is now the second-largest music streaming market globally, contributing 14% of total global audio and video streams. However, regulatory uncertainties, piracy, and infrastructure deficits threaten this growth.
Authored by Pranav Bhaskar Tiwari and Garima Saxena from The Dialogue, the report calls for investment in regional artists through recording studios, structured training programs, and government-backed grants.
To enhance India's global music influence, it recommends fostering international collaborations, government-facilitated participation in music festivals, and improved infrastructure for music tourism.
The survey represents a diverse group of musicians across regional, classical, folk, indie, hip-hop, and contemporary genres, with content in Hindi (69%), English (64%), and various regional languages (15%).

Pay-TV revenue to decline by 1-3% in FY26 due to subscriber churn: ICRA,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/pay-tv-revenue-to-decline-by-1-3-in-fy26-due-to-subscriber-churn-icra/articleshow/118732513.cms,05-03-2025,"The
Indian pay-TV industry
revenue is projected to contract by 1-3% in FY2026, driven by a sustained shrinkage in their subscriber base, which is increasingly shifting to either over-the-top (OTT) platforms or DD Free Dish services, provided by sole state-sponsored DTH operator – Prasar Bharti, according to rating agency
ICRA
.
Aggregate operating margins and coverage indicators are expected to moderate further by 175-225 bps YoY to 23-25% (33-35% for DTH and 6-8% for MSO sample) in FY2026 from FY2025 estimated levels, though strong parentage of major players will ensure adequate liquidity and access to capital for investments.
ICRA expects the subscriber base decline to be offset, to an extent, by a higher average revenue per user (ARPU, average 1-3% growth YoY) on bundled or premium offerings and industry consolidation.
Bundling of traditional TV content (with OTTs and/or broadband services) and more premium content offerings (such as HD, 4K, and live events), will support growth in ARPU. Nevertheless, increased
content acquisition costs
(e.g., sports rights, premium international content) and consistent capex/opex towards network expansion and maintenance will continue to compress margins for pay-TV operators, in ICRA’s view.
Providing her views, Ritu Goswami, Sector Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said: “Several factors make OTT a preferred mode of watching TV for consumers – like - on-demand and personalised content, ad-free viewing options, access to regional content and flexible subscription models (mobile only to multi-screen, basic to premium quality). In addition, the telecom and digital revolution (with increasing smartphone penetration, affordable data plans, percolation of smart/connected TVs) and regulatory changes (relating to pricing caps for channels and rules for their packaging) have aided the shift to non-traditional modes of TV viewing in India over the last decade.”

The Indian television market is next only to China, with nearly 190 million TV households in 2024 (estimated), a number which is expected to keep growing in the near term, with its increasing population and their disposable incomes, leading to transition from TV-dark (i.e., having no TV) households.
However, the industry is undergoing a structural evolution – with subscribers at the higher end of the ARPU pyramid moving away from pay-TV to smart/connected TV or other digital alternatives and those at the lower end shifting towards the free dish.
Further, a significant variation in urban and rural pay-TV subscriber dynamics is apparent in India; the shift away from pay-TV has been sharper in urban areas (shift to digital streaming platforms driven by higher disposable income, access to wired broadband infrastructure, among other factors) while traction for free dish services has been observed in rural or low-income households.
“Despite having a large subscriber base, the Indian TV distribution industry lags developed markets like the U.S. and Europe in size due to their higher ARPU. It is the highest in the U.S. and Europe as consumers can pay for premium content like sports, HD, and exclusive programming, while India and China maintain much lower ARPU due to their vast, price-sensitive subscriber bases. Given this price sensitivity, the pace of ‘cord-cutting’ in India will be relatively moderate, with significant variation in urban vs. rural markets. A strong tradition of TV viewing, availability of affordable hybrid offerings and challenges related to internet infrastructure will also prevent any sharp fall in pay-TV subscriptions,” Goswami added.

Dish TV CEO seeks immediate rollout of TRAI recommendation on reducing DTH licensing fee,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/dish-tv-ceo-seeks-immediate-rollout-of-trai-recommendation-on-reducing-dth-licensing-fee/articleshow/118607448.cms,27-02-2025,"New Delhi: The government should immediately implement sectoral regulator TRAI's recommendation to reduce the licensing fee from the current 8 per cent to 3 per cent of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR), said
Dish TV
CEO
Manoj Dobhal
on Thursday. He urged the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB) to act swiftly as it can drive long-term sustainability and growth of the DTH industry, which is currently struggling.
""Implementing TRAI's recommendations will unlock greater investment, foster innovation, and improve consumer access to quality services. A forward-looking regulatory approach is crucial for ensuring a competitive and thriving Pay TV ecosystem. We urge the MIB to expedite these much-needed reforms to support the industry's evolution in an increasingly digital landscape,"" Dobhal told PTI.
On February 21, TRAI to ease the financial burden on DTH operators, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has recommended a reduction in the authorisation fee from the current eight per cent to just three per cent of AGR.
The current licensing structure is placing the DTH industry in a precarious position, threatening the survival of service providers and the broader Pay TV ecosystem, he said.
Without immediate intervention, DTH players will continue to struggle under an unsustainable cost structure, limiting investment and hindering industry growth, Dobhal added.
Live Events
""The DTH industry is at a pivotal moment, where decisive policy action can drive long-term sustainability and growth,"" he said.
When asked about the announcement of leading telecom services provider Bharti
Airtel
of merger talks with Tata Group for its loss-making Direct-To-Home (DTH) business, Dobhal said this is because the industry needs regulatory support.
""
Tata Play
and
Airtel
exploring the merger, even if there is no confirmation from any of them, the fact that the news is around establishes that the DTH industry needed the regulatory help in ensuring level playing field that would have saved lot of expenses and the same could be put in creating better offerings and a broader digital horizon,"" he said.
Airtel is holding discussions with the salt-to-software conglomerate for the merger of Bharti Telemedia, which offers cable and satellite TV services, with Tata Play, according to a regulatory filing from Sunil Bharti Mittal-led firm.

Why Instagram Reels are showing more sensitive content?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/why-instagram-reels-are-showing-sensitive-content/articleshow/118590945.cms,27-02-2025,"Instagram users across the globe are reporting a sudden and disturbing shift in their feeds, with violent and NSFW content appearing frequently—even for those with
Sensitive Content Control
enabled. The complaints, which have flooded X (formerly Twitter), suggest that graphic videos, including fights and censored bodycam footage of shootings, are being pushed to the forefront of Instagram Reels.
A user posted, “Anyone else noticing this on Instagram? In the past few hours, my IG Reels feed has suddenly started showing violent or disturbing videos out of nowhere. Feels random. Is anyone else experiencing this? Or is it just me? Wondering if it’s a glitch or some weird algorithm change.”
Another wrote, “What is happening to Instagram?? All I'm seeing is sensitive and violent content every few scrolls????”
One user, disturbed by the sudden change, shared, “Is it just me or is Instagram Reels violent as f--k right now?? I am only getting fight videos and couples cheating on each other.”
Social Media Backlash
The situation has sparked outrage among users, many of whom have taken to social media to demand answers from
Meta
and Instagram.

One frustrated user tweeted, “Wtf @Meta, My Instagram feed is full of sensitive contents today more in the last 8 hours, is everyone having same issue?? @MarkZuckss Not only me, the whole Instagram is facing the same situation.”
Another added, “Bro, what the FUCK is this new Instagram Reels feed… 6 sensitive content vids in a row is insane.”
The concern isn’t limited to adult users. Parents and safety advocates are also weighing in, urging immediate action. “Highly recommend parents remove Instagram off their kid’s phones right now… reels are straight up trying to de-sensitise users over the past 24hrs. Myself and everyone I know has had sensitive content pushed to the top of their feeds. Most content without warnings. #Instagram,” one user warned.
What’s Causing the Surge in Sensitive Content?
As the complaints pile up, speculation is growing about what could be causing this wave of violent and
NSFW content on Instagram
. While Meta has yet to release an official statement, experts suggest two possible explanations: a glitch in Instagram’s content moderation system or an unintended algorithm shift.
According to Vocal Media, Instagram’s AI scans posts for sensitive material and restricts their visibility. If this system malfunctions, it could fail to filter inappropriate content, leading to its widespread appearance in users’ feeds.
Another possibility is that a recent algorithm update may have mistakenly prioritised violent or sensitive posts, inadvertently amplifying their reach. If true, this could explain why so many users are suddenly seeing distressing content in their feeds.
Past Concerns Over Instagram’s Content Moderation
This is not the first time Instagram has faced scrutiny over its content moderation. A previous investigation by The Wall Street Journal revealed that Instagram Reels had been recommending adult-themed videos to users following teen influencers, cheerleaders, and other young content creators. The report stated, “The platform served a mix of adult pornography and child-sexualising material.”
Further analysis of Meta’s AI tracking suggested that older adults engaging with young content creators were being directed towards inappropriate content. In 2023, experts concluded that the system was automatically leading users to highly problematic material, raising significant concerns about Instagram’s content recommendation algorithms.
With no official response from Meta, Instagram users are left wondering whether this surge in violent and NSFW content is a temporary glitch or a deeper issue with the platform’s algorithm. Until a fix is
implemented, many are calling for stronger safeguards, especially for younger users. For now, the mystery remains unsolved, leaving millions questioning the safety and reliability of their Instagram experience.

Govt pulls up OTT platforms for clearer classification of content amid 'India’s Got Latent' row,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/govt-pulls-up-ott-platforms-for-clearer-classification-of-content-over-indias-got-latent-row/articleshow/118413088.cms,20-02-2025,"The ministry of information and broadcasting has issued an advisory to
OTT platforms
urging stricter age-based classification of content and compliance with the Information Technology (
IT
) Rules 2021.
The advisory comes close on the heels of row over an episode of YouTube show 'India's Got Latent' by
Samay Raina
, featuring podcaster and influencer,
Ranveer Allahbadia
, who made an ""inappropriate"" comment during his guest appearance.
The advisory outlined six key points aimed at online content publishers and self-regulatory bodies of
OTT
platforms, emphasising adherence to existing laws and ethical guidelines.
""This ministry has received references from Hon’ble Members of Parliament, representations from statutory organizations and public grievances regarding alleged spread of obscene, pornographic and vulgar content published by certain publishers of online curated content (OTT platforms) and Social Media,"" the ministry said in its advisory.
""In this regard it is stated that Part-IIl of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media, Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, interalia, provide for a
Code of Ethics
for OTT platforms, and a three level institutional mechanism for redressal of grievances relating to violation of the Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics, inter-alia, requires OTT platforms not to transmit any content which is prohibited by law, undertake age-based classification of content, based on general guidelines provided in the Schedule to the Rules, implementation of access control mechanism for ‘A’ rated content to restrict access to such content by a child, and also exercise due caution and discretion,"" it added.
Live Events
After the controversy broke, host Samay Raina deleted all episodes of 'India's Got Latent' from his Youtube channel.
Dismayed at the obscene content being freely peddled on social media, SC earlier this week had indicated the need to regulate such vulgar online content.
A bench headed by justice Surya Kant had called for the Centre's views on the issue and sought the assistance of attorney general R Venkataramani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta on the next hearing.
The bench had orally observed that it would be ""very happy"" if the government did something in this regard on its own. In case the government doesn't, justice Kant made it clear that the top court would ""not overlook the importance and sensitivity"" of the issue. SC had added that it would not let go of the issue and ""would like to do something"" to tackle the ""vacuum"" in regulation of online content.

, the official broadcaster and streaming partner of the
ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025
, has announced a lineup of sponsors for the tournament.
The confirmed sponsors include
Dream11
,
Pernod Ricard India
, Beam Suntory, Kohler, Birla Opus,
Vodafone Idea
, ICICI Direct, McEnroe and
Eicher Motors
. Indira IVF and LIC Housing Finance have joined as associate sponsors on DD Sports.
“We are thrilled to bring the ICC Men’s
Champions Trophy
2025 to millions of cricket fans in India, supported by a robust roster of sponsors. This tournament is poised to be a landmark event, and the enthusiastic participation of top brands underscores the unifying power of cricket. We look forward to delivering an unmatched viewing experience for fans and meaningful value for our partners,” Anup Govindan, Chief Revenue Officer, Sports, JioStar, said.
The Champions Trophy is returning after an eight-year break and is considered a 'World Cup Lite'—a high-stakes tournament featuring the best teams in the world, sandwiched between two 50-over World Cups. With top sponsors on board, the competition is expected to attract significant attention from cricket fans and brands alike.
India will be looking to dominate the ODI format after missing out on the ICC World Test Championship final. England, after a disappointing World Cup exit, want to show they still have white-ball supremacy. South Africa, a team known for semi-final heartbreaks, now find themselves dealing with final defeats.

Total reading time has surpassed 6 million minutes, and downloads have exceeded 100,000 in the past two weeks.
Rohan Nayak, co-founder & CEO of Pocket Entertainment, highlighted AI’s role in entertainment, stating, “The fusion of AI and human storytelling marks the beginning of a new creative era. Historically, every major evolution in entertainment—be it cinema, animation, or digital streaming—has been driven by technology. At Pocket Entertainment, we are harnessing AI to amplify human creativity—empowering artists to push the boundaries of storytelling without replacing their unique artistic expression. By integrating AI into the creative workflow, we are not just increasing efficiency—we are unlocking new possibilities for storytelling at an unprecedented scale. Our users on Pocket Toons are loving it, spending over 60 minutes daily. AI-powered comics aren’t the future—they’re happening now.”
Shreyas Joshi, SVP of Pocket Toons, elaborated on AI’s impact on the comics industry: “The demand for high-quality, episodic content has never been higher.

“India is making its mark on the global AI stage, and Blaze! is the latest proof of how India is building AI for the world. I am incredibly proud that Pocket FM, a pioneer in the audio entertainment revolution, is now expanding its vision with the launch of Pocket Toons. With its proprietary AI-powered studio, Blaze!, Pocket Toons is setting new benchmarks in the comics industry—redefining storytelling by blending human creativity with AI-driven efficiency.

It is projected to reach $11.39 billion by 2028 and $15.38 billion by 2033.

TV channels have a satellite problem: Disruptions likely from Apr 1 without IN-SPACe nod,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tv-channels-have-a-satellite-problem-disruptions-likely-from-apr-1-without-in-space-nod/articleshow/118338687.cms,18-02-2025,"New Delhi: Come April 1, TV viewers may miss out on big-ticket events such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) with more than 100 channels including from the networks of
Sony
, Star and Zee staring at disruption if the foreign satellites used by them fail to secure the space regulator's approval.
As per a government mandate, only those foreign satellites or constellations having approvals from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) by the March 31 deadline are allowed to provide space-based communication or broadcasting services in the country. The mandate will only impact broadcasting or linear TV, with content streamed through over-the-top (OTT) applications continuing smoothly.
Clarity Likely by Feb-end
While a few foreign satellites such as Intelsat, Oneweb, IPStar,
OrbitConnect
and Inmarsat have secured authorisation, others including Hong Kong-based Asiasat and ApStar, China's Chinasat, and Malaysia's Measat are awaiting clearances.
The TV broadcasting industry is now hoping that either all the foreign satellites obtain authorisation by March-end, or the government grants an extension to ensure seamless broadcasting.
Live Events
However, certain sections of the industry are apprehensive due to the prevailing geopolitical situation and some satellite operators having links with China.
Officials aware of the details told ET that applications by foreign satellites are under process, and some clarity could emerge by this month-end after a meeting of the standing committee involving officials from various ministries including home affairs and Department of Space.
""Generally, it takes two meetings of this committee to make a decision. Right now, we don't know whether they will get the approval or not...by the end of this month, there will be clarity,"" an official said, asking not to be named.
Asiasat, Measat and ApStar along with Sony and Star did not respond to ET's emailed queries. Chinasat could not be reached for comment.
A Zee spokesperson said the company is in touch with IN-SPACe and during their discussions, the regulator has indicated that various operators will be granted approvals latest by early March based on successful examination of their filings.
""We do however believe that IN-SPACe should grant at least six months to Indian broadcasters to enter into agreements after the date on which the licence to the Indian entity of satellite operators is granted, preferably till September 30, 2025,"" the spokesperson said.
Officials said many foreign satellites applied recently for approval, a process which generally takes about 120 days after all the details are provided. However, there have been applications pending since September last year.
""Sometimes, the applications are not complete and additional details are sought, which consumes time. It is only when the application is complete, that it is taken up by the standing committee,"" said the official cited above.
A second official said the committee analyses all parameters of a satellite operator including shareholding pattern before giving authorisation. ""Security has to be the topmost priority while giving approvals to foreign satellites"".
In case the foreign satellites fail to get timely approval, there would likely be mass disruptions as the channels cannot be shifted to other satellites on a short notice and they would have to go off air, industry executives warned.
""As per contractual obligations, the broadcasters have to share content, including the live feed, to partners in other regions. Easiest and cheapest way to do this is through satellite. But this will suffer in case the approval does not come on time,"" an executive said on condition of anonymity.
A second executive said the option of shifting to an Indian satellite is not feasible due to capacity constraints.
""Indian satellite GSAT doesn't have the capacity and new Indian satellites can't be put in orbit in 3-4 months,"" said the executive, pointing out that shifting to other satellites is a lengthy and expensive process.

Nielsen partners with JioHotstar to offer third-party ad measurement for IPL,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/nielsen-partners-with-jiohotstar-to-offer-third-party-ad-measurement-for-ipl/articleshow/118316504.cms,17-02-2025,"Indian streaming giant
JioHotstar
has teamed up with global audience measurement leader
Nielsen
to introduce
third-party measurement
for digital ads during the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025, marking the first time an Indian live sporting event will have independent
digital ad measurement
.
With digital advertising set to reach nearly Rs 1 lakh crore, officials from both companies say the move addresses brands’ growing demand for greater transparency and accountability in ad performance metrics.
IPL, India's biggest media property, generates over Rs 4,000 crore in annual ad spends across TV and digital, with the gap between the two narrowing in both viewership and revenue. JioHotstar is owned by JioStar, a JV between
Reliance
, Disney, and Bodhi Tree.
While TV broadcasting has third-party measurement through the Broadcast Audience Research Council, digital platforms lack such a system, with much of the measurement being self-reported. Nielsen, which tracks ad effectiveness for major global sporting events like the Super Bowl, aims to bridge this gap.
Ishan Chatterjee, Chief Business Officer, Sports Revenue, SMB & Creator at JioStar, said Nielsen will establish a dedicated data pipe with JioHotstar, the IPL digital rights holder, to analyse first-party data. It will provide campaign-level insights, including impressions, clicks, and overall performance metrics throughout execution.
Live Events
The initiative will later extend to other JioHotstar content, including entertainment, he noted.
The audience measurement provider will set up a dashboard, Nielsen ONE, offering advertisers real-time ad performance insights. The service will be paid for, with advertisers charged based on impressions.
Chatterjee noted that sports consumption has increasingly shifted to digital alongside linear TV. ""One of the big challenges on the digital side is that there has never been one comprehensive ad measurement system, unlike what currently exists on TV,” he said.
""This is a big pain point for advertisers because, in this environment, every ad impression counts. They are demanding accountability, and we at JioHotstar want to address this,"" he added.
Arnaud Frade, President (Commercial), Asia, Nielsen, noted that the initiative comes as the media industry, particularly digital, becomes increasingly fragmented. He noted that the two partners will offer a transparent, robust, census-based ad measurement system that tracks every user and ad across all devices, ensuring accurate volumetric data allocation.
""Advertisers are demanding and needing a much more precise and transparent measurement of their ads. This collaboration provides clear, third-party, independent measurement of various assets, starting with the IPL, and then there's entertainment,"" he added.
Both officials said the move will boost brand trust, attract ad spending from a wide category of advertisers, and help brands optimise budgets with real-time performance insights.
""This whole thing is a new first-of-its-kind initiative, definitely in India, definitely in live sports, probably in Asia and other markets as well. And it goes back to our central thought of wanting to revolutionise ad measurement on live sports. We are starting with live sports right now, but it will be extended to all properties on JioHotstar, which includes entertainment,"" Chatterjee noted.
JioHotstar seeks to grow its market share by building advertiser trust and delivering superior outcomes, ensuring that every dollar spent with them provides better value than elsewhere.
""Now, when you have third-party validated campaign measurement practically in real time, and you are able to access this data through the dashboard, optimise campaigns, and have those discussions with us in real time, that is something no other player in the market offers, especially for live sports,"" Chatterjee said.

Dish TV's net loss surges to Rs 47 crore in Q3,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/dish-tvs-net-loss-surges-to-rs-47-crore-in-q3/articleshow/118306985.cms,16-02-2025,"Direct-to-home (DTH) operator Dish TV reported a significant surge in its net loss for the quarter ending December 31, 2024, with losses increasing 16.6 times to Rs 46.5 crore, compared to Rs 2.8 crore during the same period the previous year.
The company also experienced a 20.7% year-on-year (YoY) decline in operating revenues, which fell to Rs 373 crore. This decline is attributed to the ongoing challenges faced by the DTH industry, including competition from over-the-top (OTT) platforms and DD Free Dish, a free DTH service operated by Prasar Bharati.
Dish TV highlighted that revenues remained under pressure due to the increasing trend of online content consumption and weak discretionary spending by consumers. The company noted that cost-conscious consumers are increasingly shifting towards free DTH platforms, resulting in negative net additions during the quarter, despite a notable improvement in new subscriber acquisitions during the festival season.
Subscription revenues saw a sharp decline of 33.5%, dropping to Rs 247.2 crore. EBITDA also decreased by 31.9%, standing at Rs 122.7 crore, while total expenditure was reduced by 13.6% to Rs 250.3 crore.
Despite the overall downturn,
marketing
and promotional fees increased by 42.7% to Rs 115.2 crore.
Live Events
A report by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) reveals a decline in the active subscriber base for the DTH sector, dropping from 62.17 million in June 2024 to 59.91 million in September 2024.
The market shares among key players were distributed as follows: Tata Play led with 31.99%, followed by Bharti Telemedia at 29.38%, Dish TV at 19.53%, and Sun Direct at 19.1%.
The company expressed optimism regarding the Finance Bill 2025, which aims to boost discretionary spending by increasing disposable income for taxpayers. The positive effects of this measure are expected to be visible in the next fiscal year, it added.
Manoj Dobhal, CEO & Executive Director of Dish TV India, commented, “As an organisation,
Dish TV India
has come a long way and has, in this eventful journey, positively touched the lives of millions of stakeholders, be it our ever-valued past or present subscribers, shareholders, trade partners, suppliers, or employees. We are indebted to all of them and would like to assure our stakeholders that we will continue to do our best to scale new heights. It is with this spirit that we are venturing into the B2B e-commerce platform and other exciting initiatives, the details of which we will share in the coming quarters.”
During the third quarter, Dish TV incorporated a fully owned subsidiary, Dish Bharat Ventures, to operate and manage an e-commerce platform, including an order management technology platform. Initial work has commenced, and new employees with relevant experience have been inducted.
The company’s consolidated results now include the newly formed subsidiary, effective from October 10, 2024, in addition to its two existing subsidiaries.

Ormax Media launches brand lift measurement tool ahead of IPL,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ormax-media-launches-brand-lift-measurement-tool-ahead-of-ipl/articleshow/118253177.cms,14-02-2025,"Ormax Media
has launched
Ormax Mpact
, a tool designed to measure and analyse the effectiveness of brand integrations, sponsorships, and product placements across different media platforms.
The launch is strategically timed before Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025, which will be held from March 21, to capitalise on sponsorship investments in the cash-rich league. This initiative is a long-term project, aiming to refine and expand
data-driven insights
over the next one to two years.
The initiative aims to create a centralised repository of data to help
brands
and media platforms understand what works best in terms of audience engagement and brand lift, said Shailesh Kapoor, CEO, Ormax Media.
""This tool is essentially our vision for building a robust data repository over time, analysing how these kinds of associations work—whether with sports properties like the IPL and its teams, reality shows, print innovations, or TV channels,"" he said, adding, ""Many brands, especially on news channels, are moving beyond conventional
advertising
to explore integrations and
advertiser-funded programs
.""
The growing complexity of media, the rise of non-traditional advertising, and influencer-driven marketing have created a demand for deeper analytics. Unlike conventional brand lift studies, which are scattered across agencies, Ormax Mpact aims to aggregate data across industries to establish category benchmarks.

With over 8,000 brand collaborations executed annually in India across various media platforms, the tool will collect data from brand campaigns, sponsorships, and integrations, such as IPL sponsorships, and reality show tie-ups.
Research will be conducted through audience surveys, analysing brand performance in different target groups, with a focus on measuring effectiveness.
""Many brands already engage in this, launching campaigns or marketing innovations and seeking to understand their impact on brand measures and metrics. However, with different agencies conducting various brand lift surveys, there is no centralised data repository or collective understanding of case studies and benchmarks built over time,"" he noted.
According to Kapoor, Ormax Mpact integrates its deep media insights with large-scale research. Instead of one-off brand lift studies, it aims to build macro-level media intelligence over time.
The product is available on a commissioned basis, where brands or platforms can pay for custom research. The goal is to conduct 100-150 projects in the first year, with an initial market focus on the IPL ecosystem.
""Pricing is kept affordable to encourage adoption by both big and small brands,"" said Kapoor.

"T-Series, Saregama and Sony among other music labels seek to challenge OpenAI in copyright lawsuit",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/t-series-saregama-and-sony-among-other-music-labels-seek-to-challenge-openai-in-copyright-lawsuit/articleshow/118239519.cms,14-02-2025,"A group of India's top
Bollywood music labels
, from
T-Series
to
Saregama
and Sony, is seeking to join a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI in New Delhi, highlighting worries about improper use of recordings to train AI models, legal documents show.
Microsoft-backed OpenAI's legal challenges are mounting globally and in India, its second biggest market by users. But the company says it follows fair-use principles in employing publicly available data to build its AI models.
On Thursday, the Indian Music Industry (IMI) group, T-Series and
Saregama India
asked a New Delhi court to hear concerns about ""unauthorised use of sound recordings"" in training AI models that breaches their copyright.
The companies' contentions in the lawsuit ""are crucial for the entire music industry in India, and even worldwide,"" they said in their filing, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters.
OpenAI and the music labels did not respond to requests for comments on Friday.
Live Events
The music labels want to join a lawsuit launched last year by Indian news agency ANI that accused OpenAI's ChatGPT application of using its content without permission to train AI models.
Since then, book publishers and media groups, some backed by billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, have banded together to oppose the company in the New Delhi court.
Bollywood and Hindi pop music are big business in India.
T-Series is one of India's largest music record labels which releases about 2,000 sound records or songs annually, while Saregama, more than 100 years old, owns a repertoire of famed Indian singers such as Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar.
On its website, the IMI group says it also represents global names such as Sony Music and Warner Music.
In India, the music labels are ""concerned OpenAI and other AI systems can extract lyrics, music compositions and sound recordings from the internet,"" said an industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter is in court.
The Indian companies' latest action comes after Germany's GEMA, which represents composers, lyricists and publishers, said in November it had sued OpenAI for ChatGPT's alleged unlicensed reproduction of song lyrics with which ""the system has obviously been trained"".
OpenAI, which is grappling with new challenges from Chinese startup DeepSeek's breakthrough in cheap AI computing, opposed the ANI lawsuit on the grounds that Indian courts lack jurisdiction, as the company is U.S.-based, with servers abroad.
The next hearing in the lawsuit, which is seen as shaping the future of how AI models use copyright content in India, is set for Feb. 21.
OpenAI chief Sam Altman visited India last week, meeting the infotech minister, and discussing the country's plan to pursue low-cost AI.

Reliance-Disney to stop completely free IPL cricket streaming in India: Sources,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-disney-to-stop-completely-free-ipl-streaming-sources/articleshow/118221048.cms,13-02-2025,"The Reliance-Disney joint venture will no longer offer completely free streaming for
IPL
cricket matches and will adopt a hybrid model where subscription kicks in after content consumption reaches a threshold, three sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The entity will also launch a new rebranded streaming app, with plans starting at 149 rupees, said the first source.
The decision to change the terms of streaming the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's richest cricket league, comes after Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's
Reliance
and Walt Disney combined their India media assets in an $8.5 billion merger last year.
JioCinema has allowed free
IPL streaming
since securing the rights for the popular tournament for five years, beginning in 2023 for $3 billion.
Now, all streaming content, including IPL, will shift to a hybrid model where free viewing will be offered for a while, and then users will need to take subscriptions depending on their consumption patterns, said two of the sources with direct knowledge.
Live Events
""Once a user develops affinity to the platform, start watching free, becomes loyal ... the subscription will kick in then,"" said the first source, adding that each user's subscription could start at a different point of time.
The sources declined to be named as the plans are confidential.
Reliance, which controls the joint venture, did not respond to requests for comment.
The joint venture entity's streaming offering will be available on a new rebranded app, which will offer a basic plan starting 149 rupees ($1.72) and an ad-free version for 499 rupees ($5.75) for three months, said the first source.
The Reliance-Disney venture runs more than 100 TV channels and streaming apps in India's $28-billion media and entertainment market, where it also competes with Netflix and Amazon Prime, among others.
JioCinema had the rights to IPL cricket, a money-spinner and among the most-streamed content, as well as to the Winter Olympics and Indian Super League football. Disney's Hotstar app had the rights to the International Cricket Council's tournaments in India and English Premier League soccer.
Key decisions at the entity are being taken by Vice Chairman Uday Shankar, a media industry veteran who in his previous roles was instrumental in the rise of Disney's Hotstar streaming app.

JioHotstar goes live with more than 50 mn paid subscribers & 500 mn users,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/jiohotstar-set-to-go-live-on-friday-with-more-than-50-mn-paid-subscribers-500-mn-users/articleshow/118223415.cms,14-02-2025,"JioHotstar
, India’s largest streaming platform formed by the merger of Disney+ Hotstar and
JioCinema
, went live on Friday with more than 50 million paid subscribers and 500 million users.
The unified platform will be run by Jio Star, a joint venture between
Reliance Industries
, Walt Disney, and Bodhi Tree Systems.
ET was the first to report on October 19 that Jio Star would consolidate its two streaming platforms—Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema—into a single app, with Disney+ Hotstar as the primary platform.
The launch is strategically timed ahead of the
ICC Champions Trophy
which starts on February 19.
JioHotstar will also introduce a creator program, Spark, aimed at exploring new content formats, competing directly with Instagram and YouTube Shorts.
Live Events
Jio Star executives say the goal is to reach 1.4 billion Indians through a hybrid ad-supported and subscription-based model. The app is designed at simplifying technology, lowering pricing barriers, and expanding content access.
To begin with, JioHotstar will offer an extended free-view period, allowing as many users as possible to experience the platform. Content, including live sports and premium Hollywood titles from Disney, HBO, Paramount, and Peacock, will be available at no cost.
""We have extended the free-view window on the platform this time, meaning all content will now be available for consumers to watch for a certain free period. It’s not a limited 10-15 minute window—we’ve kept it open,"" said Kiran Mani, Jio Star CEO – Digital.
Once a user decides to continue and build a habit, they pay an affordable price to maintain the experience, added Mani.
Existing Disney+ Hotstar subscribers will continue with their current plans: Mobile (₹149), Super (₹299), and
ET Bureau
Premium (Ad-Free) (₹499) for three months. Meanwhile, JioCinema Premium subscribers will be migrated to Jio Hotstar Premium for the remaining duration of their plans.
The platform will go all-in on originals, launching two to three new shows each month and premiering at least two major films every quarter, said Kevin Vaz, CEO – Entertainment. Some of its biggest franchises, including Criminal Justice and Asur, will be part of the lineup.
Jio Star CEO - Sports Sanjog Gupta emphasised enhancing the content-viewing experience across devices, particularly as mobile and connected TV penetration grows. ""We want to ensure universal access to live sports through personalised experiences, deeper interest feeds, and outreach to audiences who may not yet be fans of the sport,"" Gupta said.
Vaz also highlighted Jio Hotstar’s aggressive expansion into South India, where it aims to become the largest content producer, delivering 500 hours of programming across Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada—markets that major streaming platforms have yet to fully tap into.
""We also have the biggest Hollywood content library in the world from Disney, HBO, Paramount, and Peacock,"" Vaz added.

Imphal became prominent as the last battleground between Allied Forces and the Japanese forces. That difficult period where many people lost their near and dear ones comes to mind. But as we celebrate the EIIFF 2025 today, we envision another type of Imphal. Perhaps, we can hope that this festival will usher in peace in this very disturbed land, he said.
He also pointed out how he couldn’t sleep the previous night, contemplating whether it is the right time for organising a film festival. There might be people who say it is not the right time. But this type of festival is very much necessary as this will give a chance to young filmmakers to grow in their fields.
I am very happy that Manipur is hosting this festival and many delegates from outside Manipur are also taking part, he said.
Further shedding light on how this type of small international festival is very important, he said that in big festivals, we get lost whereas in small film festivals there is room for establishing connections and exchanging of ideas among the filmmaking community.
Information and Public Relations minister expressed his firm belief that films have the potential to bring positive changes as they have profound impact on the society, culture and the community.
He also said that it will be a boon for film lovers if timeless classic films can be restored and digitised, thereby focusing on the importance of
film preservation
.
Manipur Chief Secretary, who is also the Chairman of the festival organising committee, PK Singh assured to make all possible efforts from his side to ensure that the festival is being organised more grandly from the next edition onwards.
Festival Director and MSFDS Secretary Sunzu Bachaspatimayum said that at a time when there exists an apprehension about visiting Manipur, the festival organisers are overwhelmed by the solidarity shown by creative minds from across the country and beyond.
The solidarity reinforced the belief that cinema has the power to unite, to heal, and to inspire. This festival is a celebration of inclusivity and the shared love for the art of motion-picture storytelling, offering a space to reconcile, to dream, and to build a hopeful future together, he said.
Over the next three days, EIFF 2025 will provide selection of films—shorts, documentaries, and fiction—alongside industry engagements designed to elevate the cinematic landscape and nurture fresh talent.
EIFF introduced two
Pitch Sessions
where emerging talents will present their fiction and nonfiction projects to industry professionals, competing for funding opportunities amounting to Rs. 8 Lakhs. These pitches mark the culmination of rigorous project development mentorship labs, where eight nonfiction and five fiction projects have been nurtured by mentors who have urged filmmakers to discover and refine their unique cinematic languages.
At least 250 people have been killed and over a thousand people injured in the ethnic violence between the tribal Kuki-Zo and the non-tribal Meitei people since May 3, 2023. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes and villages and now staying in relief camps in different districts for the past 20 months.
The ethnic violence between the non-tribals Meiteis and tribal Kuki-Zo broke out in the northeastern state on May 3, 2023, after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.

rights
, from
Providence Equity Partners
, which will remain a minority investor in Tempo and continue to work with WMG in an advisory capacity.
WMG and Providence partnered to launch Tempo in 2019, combining Providence’s
capital
and investment expertise with WMG’s deep music industry experience, resources, and network to support, promote, and build value around artists and
songwriters
globally.
Through its disciplined approach to investments and collaborative work with creative talent, Tempo has amassed a diverse
portfolio
that focuses on empowering artists and songwriters, while delivering compelling financial results. WMG’s investment will also become more accretive over time, as other rights revert to Tempo, and expand the scope of WMG’s administration and distribution.
Guy Moot, Co-Chair and CEO of
Warner Chappell
said: “By acquiring Tempo’s impressive catalog, we’re expanding Warner Chappell’s reach, bringing rights from songwriters we currently don’t represent, as well as additional rights from songwriters with whom we’re already partners. Josh Empson has assembled a thoughtful, well-rounded catalog and I’m excited to dig into new opportunities and unlock more value for these songs.”
Michael Ryan-Southern, WMG’s EVP, Chief Corporate Development Officer, added: “WMG and Tempo have a long-standing history and aligned interests in uplifting great music and catalogs. This deal is a natural fit for us, and a good example of how our investment strategy is designed to build our scale and influence, while delivering additional revenue at a high margin.”
Live Events
Michael Dominguez, Senior Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer at Providence, said: “The Tempo team has built a high-quality catalog over the years with top artists and songwriters, and has benefitted from a close partnership with WMG since its foundation. This is an exciting next step in the company’s evolution and a natural home for its catalog. We look forward to continuing to work with WMG and to support Tempo’s next phase of growth.”
Since inception, Tempo has acquired music rights from some of today’s leading songwriters, many of whom Warner Chappell co-publishes, including Twenty One Pilots’ Tyler Joseph, multi-platinum-selling recording artist Wiz Khalifa, country duo Florida Georgia Line, GRAMMY Award-winning songwriters Brett James and Shane McAnally, as well as Lukas Graham songwriters Stefan Forrest, Morten Pilegaard, Morten Ristorp Jensen, and Jaramye Daniels.
Tempo has also acquired rights from top songwriters, artists, and producers including artists such as the Jonas Brothers, Ben Rector and Korn; singer-songwriter Mia Fieldes; GRAMMY Award-winning songwriter, producer, and CMNTY Culture founder Philip Lawrence (“24k Magic” & “Uptown Funk” Bruno Mars, “All I Ask” Adele, and more); GRAMMY Award-winning songwriter, producer, engineer, and Frank Ocean collaborator Malay; and GRAMMY Award-winning artist, songwriter, and producer Jeff Bhasker.

Disney pegs equity loss from Indian JV at $300M,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-pegs-equity-loss-from-indian-jv-at-300m/articleshow/117959398.cms,06-02-2025,"Walt Disney, which holds a 37% stake in
Jio Star
, expects an equity loss of $300 million from its Indian joint venture (JV) with
Reliance Industries
(RIL) in FY25, driven by purchase accounting, showed the Q1 filings of the American company.
Formed after the merger of Star India and Viacom18, Jio Star comprises a profitable entertainment business and the loss making sports and streaming businesses. The sports division is in loss because of the upfront property rights costs.
In its FY25 outlook, Disney anticipates double-digit percentage growth in segment operating income. This includes an increase of $875 million in entertainment Direct-to-Consumer operating income, partly due to a favourable comparison against a $200 million adverse impact from Disney+ Hotstar in India in the previous year.
Disney follows an October to September financial calendar.
Following the merger, Disney deconsolidated Jio Star from its financial results starting Q1. The company reported a $33 million equity loss from the India JV in Q1, primarily due to purchase accounting.
Live Events
Disney’s Q1 results included approximately 1.5 months of Star India's operations, compared to a full year in fiscal 2024. From 14 November 2024, Disney began recognising its share of the India JV under “Equity in the income of investees.”
During the quarter, Disney recorded an impairment charge of $143 million and a non-cash tax charge of $213 million related to the Star India transaction. The after-tax income loss from the transaction stood at $356 million.
Jio Star, controlled by RIL with a 56% stake, also includes a 7% stake held by Uday Shankar and James Murdoch’s Bodhi Tree Systems.
For FY25, Jio Star is projected to contribute $73 million to Disney’s entertainment segment operating income, down from $254 million in the previous year, and $9 million to its sports segment, compared to a $636 million loss last year.
Disney and RIL completed their $8.5 billion India JV merger on 14 November 2024, combining Star and Viacom18’s TV and digital assets. For fiscal year ending March 2024, Star India had reported a standalone net loss of Rs 12,548 crore for the last fiscal year ended March 31 due to a Rs 12,319 crore provision for an ""onerous contract"" stemming from the International Cricket Council (ICC) media rights deal.
Disney recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.1 billion in Q1 FY25 and $1.5 billion in FY24 under “Restructuring and impairment charges” to reflect Star India’s fair value. These included $0.8 billion in non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses (net of tax) and a $0.2 billion non-cash tax charge related to the transaction closure.
Disney's international advertising and subscription revenue declined in Q1, primarily due to a 29% drop in advertising and a 14% decline in subscriptions at Star India.
Star India’s sports revenue plummeted to $39 million in Q1 from $399 million a year earlier due to the absence of cricket events. However, its sports segment recorded an operating profit of $9 million, reversing a $315 million loss in the previous year.
Disney+ Hotstar's advertising revenue in India fell sharply to $15 million in Q1 FY25, down from $165 million in Q1 FY24.

Is the Hindi Film Industry heavily dependent on big budget event films?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/is-the-hindi-film-industry-heavily-dependent-on-big-budget-event-films/articleshow/117794028.cms,31-01-2025,"Is the
Indian Film Industry
becoming too dependent on big-budget and
event films
(spectacles, franchise)? Going by the
box office collection
of Indian films across languages such as Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi and Hollywood, it is clear that the contribution of top ten films (big-budget, event films) to the total box office collection of Indian films in 2024 has jumped substantially from the pre-pandemic period.
According to the data by media and entertainment research and consulting firm
Ormax Media
, the contribution of top ten films to the total box office collection of Indian films across languages has improved to 41% in 2024 from 28% in 2019.

This trend is more sharply observed when one takes into account the contribution of top ten films to the total collection of films in Hindi and other regional languages. According to Ormax Media data, the contribution of top ten films to the total collection of Hindi films rose to 70% in 2024 from 49% in 2019.
Girish Wankhede, a movie trade analyst, said, “There is considerable excitement for big-budget spectacles films in audiences. These films are not only value-for-money fares but they are also suitable as family entertainers.”
Live Events
In the past few years, films which have worked at the box office are either big spectacles or events films which include
franchise films
. In 2024, the two key films which exemplified this trend are
Pushpa 2: The Rule
and
Stree 2
. One of the key reasons why big-budget spectacle films work at the box office is due to their production quality. Besides this, these films are largely experiential in nature. This means that they cannot be enjoyed outside the dark room theatre community theatre viewing.
A research titled The Great Indian Box Office Divide done by Ormax Media observed, “The growing chasm between big-ticket, event films driven by scale, franchise, or spectacle and smaller story-led films is becoming a permanent feature of the Indian box office in the post-pandemic era.” The research further notes, “Box office trends from the past three years indicate that big-ticket films will continue to become bigger, while smaller films across languages will face increasing challenges in attracting theatrical audiences.”
A key reason why the contribution of big-budget films is increasing year on year is the shift in the mindset of audiences. Today, watching films in theatres is no longer a weekend routine. It is a serious affair given the high cost of watching films in theatres. Audiences are clear about content-driven mid-and-small budget films. They watch these films on streaming platforms. Unless a mid-budget or a small-budget is a unique and exciting deal for audiences, they will not come to theatres to watch these films.

Rahul Dhyani, founder, Connplex Cinemas, a miniplex spread across Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Gujarat, said, “A big budget event film has big stars and right marketing. Awareness of such films is created much in advance. It can be as early as six months. This is a key reason audiences are excited to watch these films.” He added, “But it is important to understand that it is not necessary that all big-budget films work at the box office. I think content and right marketing play a crucial role. Today, a mid-budget film which has great content and is marketed well can easily be in the list of top ten contributing films in a year.”
A mid-budget which did not have stars and budget and worked well in 2024 was
Munjya
. The film was made on a budget of less than Rs 50 crore and it collected Rs 133 crore at the box office.
This trend of big-budget and event films making such a massive contribution to the total box office is a worry for industry observers. A key for this is in a year less than ten films qualify as big-budget events films. The research from Ormax Media pointed out, “Is this trend impeding the growth of the box office in the long run? Because there can only be so many big-ticket films releasing every year, given the paucity of stars.” The research recommended, “Franchises can be the alternative as is strongly suggested by their contribution to the top 10 films in 2024 (four of the top 10 Indian films in 2024 were franchise films. The number increases to five for Hindi cinema). Perhaps that's the way to unlock box office growth, amidst the polarised audience behaviour.”
In a year, it must be noted that the
Hindi film industry
releases 400-500 films.

Parliamentary panel to review media laws in meeting on January 31,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/parliamentary-panel-to-review-media-laws-in-meeting-on-january-31/articleshow/117722431.cms,30-01-2025,"The parliamentary committee on communications and information technology is set to convene a meeting on January 31 to review the implementation of laws governing all forms of
media
.
According to the meeting notice, representatives of the information and broadcasting ministry will brief the committee, while the
Press Council of India
(PCI) is also expected to present its views.
Originally scheduled for January 27, the meeting has gained significance amid rapid transformations in the media, driven by technological advancements and evolving consumer behaviour.
Although the detailed agenda of the meeting is not yet known, the review is intended to assess whether existing laws effectively address critical issues related to the media.
In 2023, the ministry floated the Broadcast Bill for public consultation. The bill sought to replace the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. Once enacted, it would have governed over-the-top (OTT) platforms, cable TV, direct-to-home (DTH), headend-in-the-sky (HITS), internet protocol television (IPTV), and radio. However, the bill was withdrawn following opposition from the media industry.
Live Events
India’s media and entertainment sector is governed by a range of laws, including the Cinematograph Amendment Act, 2023; Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995; Press and Registration of Periodicals Act, 2023, and Press Council Act, 1978, which regulate films, television broadcasting and print media, respectively.
Digital media and OTT platforms are regulated under the IT Act, 2000, and IT Rules, 2021, while advertising is governed by the ministry’s advertising code, Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and the guidelines of the Advertising Standards Council of India. Intellectual property rights, including copyrights, are protected under the Copyright Act.
In the committee’s 38th report, dated February 9, 2023, the ministry acknowledged receipt of a proposal from the PCI to establish a unified Media Council encompassing various media platforms. However, the ministry expressed reservations, arguing that the unique nature of different media platforms makes a single regulatory framework unsuitable.
The committee, while noting the limitations of PCI advisories and the jurisdiction of self-regulatory bodies like the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA), which applies only to its members, had recommended that the ministry explore the feasibility of creating a Media Council to oversee print, electronic and digital media, equipped with statutory powers to enforce its orders where necessary.

OpenAI asks Indian court to throw out book publishers challenge in copyright battle,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/openai-asks-indian-court-to-throw-out-book-publishers-challenge-in-copyright-battle/articleshow/117620152.cms,28-01-2025,"OpenAI
has asked an Indian court to quash a plea by a group representing Indian and global book publishers that accuse it of
copyright breaches
, arguing its ChatGPT service only disseminates public information, legal papers show.
The case, which began with legal action last year by local news agency ANI, will be heard in New Delhi on Tuesday. It has the potential to shape the legal framework for artificial intelligence in India - OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.
In recent weeks, book publishers and almost a dozen digital media outlets, including those owned by billionaires
Gautam Adani
and
Mukesh Ambani
, have joined the case to challenge the AI giant.
The Federation of Indian Publishers, which represents many Indian firms and likes of Bloomsbury and Penguin Random House, has argued ChatGPT produces book summaries and extracts from unlicensed online copies, hurting their business.
OpenAI countered that the information was drawn from platforms like Wikipedia or abstracts, summaries, tables of content made publicly available on the websites of the publishers in question, according to a Jan. 26 non-public court filing seen by Reuters.
Live Events
""Web-crawlers are designed to only access publically available data,"" OpenAI said in its 21-page response to the book publishers's argument.
The book publishers have ""entirely failed to demonstrate even a single instance"" that OpenAI services are trained on ""original literary work,"" it said.
Pranav Gupta, secretary of the federation, told Reuters that most book-related content being shown by ChatGPT was scraped from websites that have licensing arrangements with book publishers.
OpenAI maintains it only uses publicly available data in a manner protected by fair use principles. Asked for comment on Tuesday, it referred Reuters to its earlier statements and the court filing challenging the book publishers.
OpenAI has also said, in its initial response to the ANI case, that Indian judges have no jurisdiction to hear a case against it as its servers are located abroad.
The case is one of many that is being heard globally in which authors, news organisations and musicians have accused technology firms of using their copyrighted work to train AI services without permission or license.

Courts globally are hearing claims by authors, news organisations and musicians who accuse technology firms of using their copyrighted work to train AI services without permission or payment.
The Indian media outlets, including Adani's
NDTV
and Ambani's Network18, have told a New Delhi court they want to join an ongoing lawsuit against the ChatGPT creator as they are worried their news websites are being scraped to store and reproduce their work for users of the powerful AI tool.
Reuters was first to report the case filing by the news publishers, which escalates an ongoing legal battle against ChatGPT in India. In the most high-profile battle, local news agency ANI was first to file a lawsuit against OpenAI last year. Global and Indian book publishers joined on Friday.
The 135-page case filing, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters, argues OpenAI's conduct constitutes ""a clear and present danger to the valuable copyrights"" of Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) members and other outlets.

It refers to OpenAI's ""wilful scraping ... and adaptation of content"", adding that ""the disproportionate power of tech companies in prioritising content and extracting advertising revenue has raised concerns among publishers.""
The filing was made by the Indian Express, Hindustan Times, Adani's NDTV and the DNPA, which represents roughly 20 companies including Mukesh Ambani Network18 and players like Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar, Zee News, India Today Group and the Hindu. Many of these outlets have a flourishing newspaper and television news business too.
The Times of India is not part of the legal challenge despite being member of the DNPA, the filing said, without elaborating on the reasons.
OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations made by the Indian news outlets. It has repeatedly denied such allegations, saying its AI systems make fair use of publicly available data.
None of the Indian media companies involved immediately responded to Reuters request for comment.
LANDMARK INDIA CASE
In the United States, the New York Times sued OpenAI and its largest financial backer Microsoft in December 2023, accusing them of using millions of its articles without permission to train chatbots to provide information to users.
The new Indian intervention will add firepower to ANI's lawsuit against OpenAI in India's most high-profile legal proceedings on the issue.
A hearing in ANI's lawsuit against OpenAI is scheduled for Tuesday.
Responding to the ANI case, OpenAI said in comments reported by Reuters last week that any order to delete training data would result in a violation of its U.S. legal obligations, and Indian judges have no jurisdiction to hear a copyright case against the company as its servers are located abroad.
Reuters, which holds a 26% interest in ANI, has said in a statement it is not involved in ANI's business practices or operations.
In recent months, OpenAI has signed deals with Time magazine, the Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, France's Le Monde and Spain's Prisa Media to display content.
The Indian publishers in their new filing argue OpenAI has entered into partnership agreements with media outlets abroad, but has not entered into similar deals in India, hurting the media companies.
Such conduct by OpenAI ""in India betrays an inexplicable defiance of the law,"" the Indian media outlets' filing said.
The publishers also said OpenAI was set to become a profit-driven business benefiting from the creative works of the media industry. This would result in a ""weakened press"" and would not be in the best interests of a vibrant democracy, their filing said.
OpenAI kicked off an investment, consumer and corporate frenzy in generative AI after the Nov. 2022 launch of ChatGPT. It wants to be ahead in the AI race after raising $6.6 billion last year.
It made its first India hire last year when it tapped a former WhatsApp executive, Pragya Misra, to handle public policy and partnerships in the country of 1.4 billion people, where millions of new users are going online, thanks to cheap mobile data prices.

"Like films, lower ticket price formula too flops",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/like-films-lower-ticket-price-formula-too-flops/articleshow/117466840.cms,23-01-2025,"Mumbai: The poor performance of recently released Hindi films such as 'Emergency' and 'Azaad' even after lowering ticket prices to '99 due to Cinema Lovers' Day has raised a question over the assumption in the industry that low ticket prices ensure high footfalls in theatres.
""The performance of both 'Azaad' and 'Emergency' at the box office has broken the myth in the industry that low ticket prices ensure high footfalls in theatres,"" said Ameya Naik, producer and founder of event management company
Fantasy Films
.
Exhibitors celebrated Cinema Lovers Day on January 17 and offered tickets at '99. On the same day, 'Emergency' and 'Azaad' were released. Despite the Cinema Lovers Day, 'Emergency' and 'Azaad' collected '2.5 crore and '1.5 crore, respectively. This shows that lower ticket prices do not translate into higher footfalls in theatres. Also, according to box office data research firm Sacnilk, the overall occupancy levels for 'Emergency' and 'Azaad' have been in the range of 5-7% since their release last Friday.
Komal Nahta, a veteran trade analyst, said, ""There was a novelty factor when exhibitors launched the campaign of celebrating National Cinema Day by offering tickets at '99. But gradually, this campaign began to lose its charm. Reducing ticket prices is not enough. Audiences want a combination of entertaining and exciting content along with reasonable ticket pricing.""

""Footfalls for new releases - Emergency and Azaad - even in cinemas where ticket price is '99 are so low that it seems that people are not interested in watching films even if the admission price is low,"" he added.
After the pandemic, exhibitors initiated a mood-changing campaign to woo audiences to theatres by offering tickets at '99 on any day. The rationale behind the campaign was to boost footfalls in theatres. The first National Cinema Day was first celebrated on September 20, 2022. But as films failed at box office, exhibitors stared at high fixed costs. To compensate for weak footfalls in theatres, exhibitors re-launched National Cinema Day with a different name and re-released well-accepted old films in theatres.

Netflix hikes content budget to $18 billion for fiscal 2025,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/netflix-hikes-content-budget-to-18-billion-for-fiscal-2025/articleshow/117461349.cms,22-01-2025,"Global streaming giant Netflix plans to increase its cash content spend to an estimated $18 billion in 2025, up from $17 billion in the previous year, said Chief Financial Officer Spencer Adam Neumann outlining the company's strategic priorities during an investor call on January 21, emphasising the significant growth potential in an increasingly competitive entertainment landscape.
""We're small in terms of view share and
penetration
everywhere around the world,"" Neumann stated. ""We're less than 50% penetrated into connected households globally, and we're only capturing about 6% of our estimated
revenue
market. We have a long way to grow.""
The $18 billion investment will drive the platform’s focus on key content areas, including big-budget scripted television series, original programming tailored to regional audiences, and impactful licensing deals. Live content and interactive entertainment, such as games, are also high on the agenda, reflecting Netflix’s ambition to diversify its offerings.
Neumann underscored the disciplined approach to spending, ensuring alignment with revenue growth and margin targets. ""Our cash spend and content amortisation maintain a ratio of approximately 1.1, growing slower than our revenue,"" he explained.
Beyond content, Netflix is investing in product innovation,
advertising
capabilities, and enhanced user experiences. Substantial resources are being allocated to the product and engineering teams to bolster ad-supported streaming options, live events, and games. A revamped user interface aimed at improving content discovery is also in development.

""We're pretty heavily investing into our product and engineering teams to build out ads and live and games capabilities and also our new user interface to enhance our product discovery. We're also investing in the
marketing
and sales line, mostly on the sales side as we build out our ads sales organisation and go-to-market capabilities,"" Neumann said.
Netflix has projected a 12 to 14% revenue growth for 2025, with expenses expected to grow around 9%, maintaining a trajectory of improving margins. Content amortisation is forecast to grow in the high single digits, below the pace of revenue growth, enabling incremental margin gains.
Neumann reiterated the company’s long-term vision: ""The opportunity ahead is vast, and we remain focused on growing engagement and delighting a broader audience worldwide. By strategically deploying resources, we aim to deliver sustainable growth while meeting the evolving needs of our viewers.""
In a letter to shareholders, the company said that its 2024 revenue grew by 16% year-on-year to $39 billion, with operating margins expanding by six points to 27%. Operating income exceeded $10 billion for the first time in the company’s history.
During the fourth quarter ending December, revenue increased by 16% year-on-year to $10.2 billion, driven by 19 million paid net additions, while operating income rose by 52% year-on-year. Netflix ended fiscal 2024 with 302 million memberships.
The company said that the Q4 content slate outperformed expectations, with Squid Game 2 on track to become one of Netflix's most-watched original series. Carry-On joined the all-time top ten films list, while the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight became the most-streamed sporting event ever, it added. On Christmas Day, Netflix delivered the two most-streamed NFL games in history.

Consumer Goods companies step up ad spends in bid to push sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/consumer-goods-companies-step-up-ad-spends-in-bid-to-push-sales/articleshow/117436459.cms,21-01-2025,"In a last-ditch effort to meet fiscal year-end
sales targets
,
consumer goods companies
are increasing their advertising and marketing spends by up to 20% year-on-year this quarter, with some even surpassing high-demand Diwali quarter ad spends.
Sectors such as automobiles, retail, electronics and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are driving this surge as many companies' sales remain below targets amid muted consumer sentiment, industry executives said.
Some companies are also reinvesting higher profits into advertising as they look to cash in on events such as the Kumbh Mela.
""The January-March quarter will be our highest spending on advertising, marketing and promotion for this fiscal,"" said Angshu Mallick, chief executive of
Adani Wilmar
, the country's largest packaged edible oil company.
""There are multiple religious and social events including Kumbh Mela and Eid is earlier this quarter, when sales of oil, rice, maida and besan peaks. Hence, spending is up by 15-20% over last year. We are also building inventory in the channel,"" he said.
Live Events
ET Bureau
Apart from religious and social events, brands have also earmarked higher budgets for the ongoing end of season and Republic Day sales this month.
Companies will also raise the pitch early for summer products like ACs, ice cream and beverages due to a shorter winter, executives said.
""We would start the advertising campaign earlier from mid-February with a budget higher by almost 20% year-on-year as sales projection is good,"" said KJ Jawa, managing director of Daikin India, one of the largest air-conditioner makers.
Sales of consumer goods across categories have been muted this fiscal due to high inflation in daily lives of consumers and low salary increases. Sales of passenger vehicles increased by a modest 1.8% to 3.14 million units during the April-December period of this fiscal as compared to 7.3% growth in the year-earlier period.
Latest data from researcher NielsenIQ shows volume sales of electronic products in India remained flat in January to September 2024 while those of FMCG grew 5.3%, though the pace slowed in September quarter by three percentage points compared to the March quarter.
Auto companies like
Maruti Suzuki
,
Hyundai
, Honda Cars, JSW MG Motor India and Kia have stepped up advertising and marketing spending by up to 20% in the March quarter over last year, as per industry executives. Most of them have also launched new models in the last two months.
""We are strategically leveraging high-impact associations such as the Australian Open, YouTube takeovers, OTT platforms, and prime-time showcases like Bigg Boss and the India-England T20 series,"" said Virat Khullar, AVP and vertical head (marketing) at Hyundai Motor India.
A senior auto industry executive said companies across the board have been making tactical spends to attract buyers. Tactical spends or marketing campaigns account for about 40% of ad spends by auto companies while the remaining goes into brand campaigns.
Jayen Mehta, managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which owns the Amul brand, said media spending will be much higher from now till summer as compared to last year since the brand has associated with all big cricketing events, Eid, marriage season and it expects robust summer.
Emami
, which this month rebranded its male grooming product due to falling sales in past few quarters, has earmarked ₹15 crore for advertising on it this quarter.
As per a January report by Nuvama Institutional Equities, the margin improvement due to various cost-initiatives and focus on innovations will keep advertising spends competitive for FMCG companies.

"Dubbed Hindi films on a roll, clock 5x surge in box office collections",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/dubbed-hindi-films-on-a-roll-clock-5x-surge-in-box-office-collections/articleshow/117378112.cms,20-01-2025,"Films dubbed in Hindi saw a nearly fivefold jump in collection to Rs 1,464 crore in 2024 from Rs 295 crore, according to the 2024
Box Office Report
of media and entertainment research and consulting firm
Ormax Media
.
On the other hand, films made in Hindi language saw a 37% dip in collection to Rs 3215 crore from Rs 5085 crore in the previous year.
The share of
dubbed Hindi films
in the total collection of films in Hindi language surged to 31.2% in 2024 from about 6% in 2023, according to the report.
“The increasing contribution of dubbed films to the Hindi box office can be attributed to successful storytelling in
south Indian films
, particularly
Telugu cinema
. This aligns more closely with the evolving preferences of Hindi theatrical audiences and their perception of ‘theatrical worthiness’ of films,” said Sanket Kulkarni, head of business development (theatrical), at Ormax Media. “Increasing viewership of films on streaming platforms and box-office successes of several dubbed films have encouraged exploration of diverse cinemas beyond Hindi. These factors have greatly increased audience comfort of watching dubbed content in theatres.”
Among the dubbed southern films released in 2024, Pushpa 2 – The Rule contributed Rs 889 crore and
Kalki 2898 AD
contributed Rs 348 crore to the Hindi film collection.

Producer Rajesh R Nair, known for films such as Kaminey and Adipurush, said, “Today, southern films are targeting the northern Hindi market. After Allu Arjun released Pushpa 2: The Rule’s trailer in Patna, Bihar, Telugu actor Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi released a song of their upcoming film Thandel in Varanasi. This strategy is working because the audience in the northern market knows them.”
He added, “Crossover southern films are giving much better content than Hindi films in the past two to three years. Recently, makers of Pushpa 2: The Rule added 20 minutes to their film and released it in theatres. This addition has increased a day’s collection by two times in the past two days. This shows how audiences are clued into dubbed Hindi films.”
Trade analysts estimate that the collection of the dubbed Hindi Pushpa 2: The Rule jumped to Rs 45-50 lakh from Rs 15 lakh between Friday and Saturday. Even a mid-budget Malayalam film Marco, which was hardly promoted before its release, has attracted audiences and collected Rs 13 crore in its Hindi dubbed version.
Suniel Wadhwa co-founder and director, Karmic Films, said, “South Indian cinema continues to transcend boundaries, captivating audiences across India. Blockbusters like Pushpa 2: The Rule, Kalki 2898 AD, Maharaja and Jailer have redefined pan-India success with their gripping stories, breathtaking visuals and unmatched appeal in Hindi-dubbed versions, proving that great cinema speaks a universal language.”
He further said, “As 2025 unfolds, south Indian cinema promises another wave of box-office triumphs. With highly anticipated releases like Coolie, L2: Empuraan, Kantara: Chapter 2 and Thug of Life, the stage is set for these films to captivate audiences, redefine storytelling and continue the legacy of pan-India success in Hindi-dubbed versions.”
Producer Rajesh R Nair concurred, saying, “I think the contribution of dubbed Hindi films to the total Hindi collection will grow much higher than their contribution in 2024. But more than dubbed Hindi films, in 2025, we will also see southern actors in pivotal roles in Hindi films. A lot of conversations are happening on these lines in the industry. So, the crossover is becoming larger.”
One of the biggest Hindi releases of 2025, War 2, has Telugu actor NT Rama Rao Jr. Besides, Kannada actor Rishab Shetty will play Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the upcoming biopic The Pride of Bharat: Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

According to a FICCI-EY report, film music dominated 64% of total music consumption in 2023, while artist-driven music continued to gain traction, accounting for 27%. Digital revenues made up 87% of total music segment revenue during the year.
Music streaming platforms reached around 185 million listeners in 2023, yet only about 7.5 million users subscribed to paid plans. Platforms like Spotify, Gaana, and JioSaavn are pushing for subscriptions to build sustainable business models.
YouTube remains the leading ad-supported music OTT platform. With 284 million subscribers, T-Series, India's top YouTube channel, is the second most subscribed globally. Zee Music has 113 million subscribers, followed by Sony Music India with 63 million.
The music industry's growth is further bolstered by widespread smartphone use, affordable data, reduction in piracy, a shift to paid streaming models, expanding digital advertising, and the rise of short-format apps. Additionally, the rise of regional music is playing a pivotal role in driving the industry's expansion.
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported last year that India became the 14th largest music market globally in 2023, with industry revenues increasing by 15.3%. It also highlighted that global recorded music revenues grew by 10.2%, reaching $28.6 billion, driven by a rise in paid streaming subscribers.

Explained: Who is behind Hindenburg Research and what is their allegation on Madhabi Puri Buch
While the allegations against the Adani Group caused a market collapse and wiped out billions of dollars in Adani’s wealth, Hindenburg also raised concerns about India’s top market regulator, SEBI.
Also Read:
Why did Hindenburg shut down?
Last year, Hindenburg accused SEBI Chairperson
Madhabi Puri Buch
and her husband Dhaval Buch of having a conflict of interest, claiming they held stakes in offshore entities linked to the alleged Adani money siphoning. These allegations were based on documents provided by a whistleblower and other investigations.
Hindenburg's Bollywood connection
However, Adani and Madhabi Puri were not the only targets of Hindenburg's reports. The firm had also investigated an Indian film company.
In August 2017, when Hindenburg Research was first established, the firm’s initial reports focused on the U.S.-listed Indian film company
Eros International
. These reports accused the company of major accounting problems, including undisclosed related party transactions, asset inflation, and falsified revenue. The company sued Hindenburg, but the lawsuit was dismissed.

Hindenburg allegations are red herrings thrown by discredited short-seller: Adani Group
Hindenburg followed up with a third report in 2019, claiming ""serious accounting issues.""
In January 2023, the company was removed from the NYSE. Nearly 8 years after the initial reports, India's securities regulator, SEBI, confirmed many of Hindenburg’s findings, revealing several illegal related party transactions involving the same people and entities. SEBI's orders in June 2023 and October 2024 provided evidence suggesting possible fund siphoning and financial record manipulation. The regulator imposed fines and banned Eros’s promoter and managing director, Sunil Lulla.

From market rout to bankruptcy, here's how Hindenburg shook some empires
The Eros Saga: Details of Hindenburg’s allegations
Hindenburg claimed that Eros consistently had a large balance of uncollected accounts receivables, which suggested that the company struggled unusually to collect its revenue. In the worst case, this could indicate fraudulent revenue transactions or 'round tripping,' a method used to artificially inflate company metrics without any real financial benefit, the short seller said.

Hindenburg vs Adani-Sebi row: Who said what and all that has happened so far
In an earlier report, Hindenburg raised suspicions about Eros Television Private Limited, a company outside of Eros’s corporate structure that had very little financial activity except for advances and payables.
Hindenburg then uncovered another company, Ayngaran International Films Private Limited (AIFPL), which followed a similar pattern. AIFPL appeared outside the Eros corporate structure and had limited financial activity, primarily large advances and payables. The filing revealed two key points: (i) a recent director’s report showed Eros as the main lender to AIFPL, and (ii) the report identified ""related parties"" as the main recipients of AIFPL’s payables. These related parties included Eros subsidiaries and individuals tied to the company.
Hindenburg stated that the filing indicated Eros lent money to AIFPL, which then owed large amounts to Eros-controlled or related entities. AIFPL showed little other financial activity. Hindenburg believes this raises further questions about Eros’s accounting practices related to its receivables.
In June 2019, one of Eros's key Indian subsidiaries had its credit rating dropped by 10 levels to ""default"" by CARE Ratings, India’s second-largest rating agency. According to CARE, the downgrade was due to “slow collection from debtors.”
Hindenburg said the default occurred just as the firm was concluding its investigation into why Eros was persistently unable to collect money from its debtors.
Hindenburg added that after extensive research in India, interviews with former employees, and a review of Indian private company filings, it believes that a large portion of Eros's receivables may not exist at all.
Hindenburg also uncovered details of highly suspicious related-party transactions. For example, Eros allegedly directed $153 million to a supposed production company operating out of a small office in a Mumbai slum. The company was run by the brother-in-law of Eros’s Chairman and CEO.

"TRAI aims to align regulations for ground-based, satellite broadcasters",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/trai-aims-to-align-regulations-for-ground-based-satellite-broadcasters/articleshow/117276747.cms,16-01-2025,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) has recommended that the
regulatory framework
for
ground-based broadcasters
(GBBs) be aligned with the 2022 uplinking and downlinking guidelines for satellite-based broadcasters (SBBs), wherever applicable, except for those rules specific to satellite use.
Currently, there is no dedicated regulatory framework for GBBs, which transmit content terrestrially to
cable television networks
without relying on satellite uplinking or downlinking.
In its recommendations on the ""Regulatory Framework for Ground-Based Broadcasters,"" TRAI highlighted that technological advancements now enable GBBs to deliver TV channels to
distribution platform operators
(DPOs) via terrestrial communication technologies, including wireline, wireless, internet, or cloud-based methods.
On May 22, 2024, the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) sought TRAI's recommendations on GBBs under Section 11(1)(a) of the TRAI Act, 1997.
TRAI suggested that GBBs be allowed to use any terrestrial communication medium without restrictions for delivering channels to DPOs. Additionally, the service area for GBBs should be national in scope.
Live Events
TRAI also proposed that GBBs may switch to or supplement their operations with SBBs upon obtaining approval from the central government. Similarly, SBBs may transition to or additionally adopt terrestrial communication technologies with government permission.
Regarding stakeholders' concerns about the absence of regulations for
Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television
(FAST) channels, TRAI recommended that the MIB examine the compliance of FAST channels with existing guidelines and, if required, issue new policy guidelines in consultation with TRAI.

Tennis Australia
, the organiser of the prestigious tennis grand slam event
Australian Open
, aims to grow its footprint in India through strategic initiatives such as strengthening
media rights partnership
, grassroots development, corporate sponsorships with Indian companies, and leveraging cricket's widespread appeal to promote tennis, said a top official.
""It is really important to the Australian Open that we have a clear long-term vision for India, that we have a relationship as it relates to commercial opportunities, ticketing and travel opportunities, playing opportunities, how we can support India in the development of its players and entertainment opportunities,"" CEO
Craig Tiley
told ET.
Tiley highlighted the Australian Open's longstanding media rights agreement with
Sony Pictures Networks India
(SPNI) and its technology partnership with
Infosys
as key components of its India-centric strategy.
He also said that across regions and countries, the top audience for the Australian Open on YouTube is in India. Tennis is a top-three sport on YouTube globally, he added.
""We have a long-term partnership with Sony from a broadcast perspective. Over the last six years, we've had a partnership in Infosys, which is also our tech partner,"" he said.

Tiley pointed out that the partnership with Sony Sports has been fruitful, especially over the past decade, with strong viewer engagement, particularly during matches featuring Indian players.
According to Broadcast Audience Research Council data, live Australian Open Tennis match viewership on Sony Sports Network increased from 9.8 million to 17.6 million, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 15.74% in the post-Covid period.

Kaul added that Australian Open has consistently ranked among the most-watched grand slams, attracting brands seeking to engage with affluent tennis enthusiasts.

TV channels raise tariffs despite shrinking base as costs bite,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tv-channels-raise-tariffs-despite-shrinking-base-as-costs-bite/articleshow/116925330.cms,04-01-2025,"Mumbai: TV broadcasters are implementing inflation-linked increases in TV channel bouquet rates to offset rising content costs and a subdued
advertising
environment. However, concerns persist about subscriber churn due to the growing popularity of over-the-top (OTT) platforms and DD Free Dish.
Sony Pictures Networks India
(SPNI) and
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEEL) are among the major broadcasters that have published updated broadcast tariffs. Star India, also known as Jio Star, is expected to release its tariff soon.
Both SPNI and ZEEL have raised the prices of their base bouquets by over 10%. Jio Star is anticipated to implement a significant hike due to its strong presence in general entertainment and sports. The new pricing is effective February 1.
SPNI's Happy India Smart Hindi pack now costs ₹54, up from ₹48. However, the bouquet now also includes a Hindi movie channel, Sony Max 1. Meanwhile, Zee Family Pack Hindi SD now costs ₹53, compared to ₹47 previously, and includes English entertainment channel Zee Cafe.
The price hike comes at a time when the pay-TV industry has declined to fewer than 100 million homes, down from 120 million to 95 million in recent years. According to TRAI's latest Performance Indicator Report, the combined paid active DTH base of four private operators -
Dish TV
, Airtel Digital TV, Tata Play, and Sun Direct - shrank by 2.26 million to 59.91 million as of September 2024.
Live Events
Distribution
platform operators (DPOs) are concerned that annual price hikes by broadcasters will add to their burden, as subscribers have multiple alternatives, including premium OTT services, DD Free Dish, and YouTube, which continue to gain traction across various consumer segments.
However, TV broadcasters argue that they have no option but to increase bouquet rates despite fears of a shrinking pay-TV universe. They point out that the advertising revenue of major broadcasters remains under pressure due to slower growth in advertising expenditure (AdEx) and a shift in advertising strategies toward digital platforms.  ""The pay-TV universe will continue to decline even if we don't implement the rate hike, but at least we can protect our revenue by increasing the average revenue per user (ARPU),"" said a senior TV broadcasting executive on condition of anonymity.
This marks the third consecutive year of bouquet price increases following the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (TRAI) amendment of the new tariff order (NTO) after a protracted legal dispute between broadcasters and the regulator.
A cable TV official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, described the price hike as a ""double whammy"" for DPOs, who bear the brunt of consumer dissatisfaction. ""Price hikes by broadcasters will definitely increase churn. So far, DPOs have shielded consumers from the full impact by keeping the network capacity fee (NCF) at a reasonable level,"" he added.
The NCF is the fee consumers pay to DPOs for transmitting content through their networks. Bouquet rates are passed on by DPOs from consumers to broadcasters after retaining a commission.
Broadcasters are also adhering to the recent Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) order, which declined interim relief regarding pay channels on DD Free Dish. The regulation mandates that free channels on Prasar Bharati's DD Free Dish cannot be classified as pay channels on addressable platforms like
Hathway Cable
and Tata Play.

Maddock Films
has announced eight new films across diverse genres for the next four years.
Films such as Thama (2025), Shakti Shalini (2025), Bhediya 2 (2026), Chamunda (2026), Stree 3 (2027), Mahamunjya (2027), Pehla
Mahayudh
(2028), and Doosara Mahayudh (2028) follow a cinematic universe based on the theme of horror-comedy. These films will get released in the next four years.
Dinesh Vijan, founder, Maddock Films, said, ""Our mission at Maddock has always been to innovate and entertain. We've crafted compelling characters that resonate with audiences, grounded in India's rich culture and heritage. This deep connection has made our stories not just relatable, but also meaningful.""
2024 has been a landmark year for Maddock Films. The production house has been the biggest outlier in 2024. In 2024, when more films failed than worked, Maddock Films'
Stree 2
, Munjya, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya and Sector 36 enthralled and proved successes in a time when success has become extremely elusive.
Stree 2 had emerged as the first Hindi film to cross Rs600 crore net collection at the domestic box office, indicating the production house's ability to create a successful cinematic universe of horror-comedies. The film resonated deeply with audiences, propelling horror comedy further into the mainstream cinema.
Live Events
Vijan of Maddock Films explained, ""We have consistently redefined Indian cinema with every release. From delivering mega-blockbusters like Stree 2, Munjya, and Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, Maddock Films has cemented itself as a powerhouse of innovative storytelling.""
Riding high on the success of Stree 2, Maddock Films has embarked on its most ambitious venture of an
interconnected cinematic universe
of horror-comedy superheroes. Spanning the next four years, this grand narrative will culminate in Mahayudh (2028), an epic two-part saga. According to the production house, Mahayudh (2028) is likely to redefine the boundaries of horror-comedy in Indian cinema and push the limits of both genre and scale.
The production house believes that the key to success in Indian cinema lies in blending heritage with innovation.

TDSAT
) has refused to grant a stay to broadcasters challenging the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
’s (
TRAI
) July 8 tariff regulation concerning
pay channels on DD Free Dish
.
The TDSAT bench, comprising Chairperson Justice D. N. Patel and member Subodh Kumar Gupta, issued an order directing broadcasters to comply with the regulation by publishing a new Reference Interconnect Offer (RIO) within two weeks. The matter is scheduled to be listed for directions on February 6, 2025.
The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF) approached TDSAT following a Supreme Court directive to challenge recent amendments to
broadcast tariff regulations
before the tribunal. Earlier, the Kerala High Court had dismissed IBDF’s petition, stating that TDSAT was the appropriate forum for the matter.
Direct-to-Home (DTH) operators Tata Play, Bharti Telemedia, and
Dish TV
, alongside the All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF), have sought to be impleaded in the case.
During the hearing on Thursday, IBDF counsel Amit Sibal sought two weeks’ time to publish a revised RIO, subject to the outcome of the appeal. He argued that when the writ petition was filed before the Kerala High Court, TRAI had agreed not to take coercive action against the petitioner. This position continued through the litigation at the Supreme Court, which disposed of the appeal on November 29.
Live Events
The IBDF, through its counsel, also raised concerns about unequals being treated equally and arbitrariness by TRAI, alleging a lack of jurisdiction and violations of constitutional provisions, particularly Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution, as well as Section 11(4) of the TRAI Act, 1997.
The contentious regulation mandates that
Free-to-Air
(FTA) channels on Prasar Bharati's free DTH platform DD Free Dish cannot be classified as
pay channels
on addressable platforms like Hathway Cable and Tata Play.
In its petition, IBDF argued that DD Free Dish cannot be equated with other distribution platform operators (DPOs), as it does not charge consumers a subscription fee, unlike private DPOs that do.
It also expressed concerns that TRAI's stringent conditions could reduce channel reach adding that broadcasters might be forced to either withdraw their channels from DD Free Dish or make them FTA on other DPOs, thereby excluding them from pay channel bouquets.
DPOs have long claimed that broadcasters unfairly charge for channels that are free-to-air on
DD Free Dish
. Around 15-20 pay channels from various genres are currently available on DD Free Dish.
The TRAI and the DPOs have argued that the tariff regulation has been applied to TV broadcasters and not to DD Free Dish. The DPOs have in the past contended that DD Free Dish operates as a commercial platform, with the only notable difference being that it doesn't charge any subscription fee.

Jyotiraditya Scindia
said regulating over-the-top (OTT) platforms comes under the purview of the information and broadcasting (I&B) ministry, even though the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is examining issues raised by
telecom operators
about pushing these platforms to share infrastructure cost.
Telcos have been urging the government to frame rules mandating OTTs to share network infrastructure cost with carriers. They have repeatedly said telecom infrastructure expansion has not kept pace with explosive growth in data consumption, and OTTs must share costs.
The OTT platforms have strongly resisted this, saying any move to impose such onerous regulatory compliances meant for the telecom sector would discourage OTTs from investing in innovation and new technologies, and compel them to charge consumers for services that are free.
Scindia also backed the setting up of a dedicated manufacturing zone to make telecom equipment, saying that will be the DoT's next goal after reviving BSNL and powering its
4G expansion
.
""Manufacturing is key to the telecom sector. As PM Modi has always envisioned, we must be an Atmanirbhar country,"" Scindia was quoted telling a news agency.
Live Events
He said while the government had the option to import 4G equipment to drive BSNL's network expansion, it chose the more challenging route of building the capability locally, resulting in India becoming the fifth country to have its own 4G stack.
""The third step is the telecom manufacturing zone. As SEZs are made, a manufacturing zone should be made for the telecom sector,"" Scindia said, according to the report.

A new era of financial storytelling
If Wall Street taught us “Greed is good,” Brokerage challenges the narrative by shining a light on ethical investing and sustainable market practices. Lines like, “It’s not the market that breaks you; it’s the system that bleeds you dry,” will arguably resonate with the audience, as Brokerage balances cinematic drama with a deeper message of financial awareness.
This film delves into the challenges and realities of India’s brokerage system within the stock market.
Brokerage is not just a film—it’s a movement. Just as The Big Short educated audiences on the 2008 crisis and Scam 1992 revived interest in India’s financial history, Brokerage aims to inspire change, spark critical conversations, and empower millions to navigate the stock market with greater awareness and confidence. A must-watch for anyone seeking insight into financial empowerment and market transparency!

The first major opportunity identified by the company focuses on strengthening partnerships with international sporting federations such as Formula One, MotoGP, SailGP and World Athletics, which constitute the largest sub-segment in the vertical.
The second key focus area involves assisting Indian broadcasters in adopting advanced technologies, including cloud-based and internet protocol (IP)-driven distribution systems. The third is centred around tapping into the expanding e-gaming and esports markets, capitalising on the global rise of competitive gaming and interactive entertainment.
A critical shift for Tata Communications has been its move from traditional way of producing live events to cloud-based, remote production. The transformation has helped streamline operations while enhancing content delivery, enabling personalised content tailored to regional preferences.
He emphasised that global sporting federations have partnered with Tata Communications due to its cutting-edge technology, and the expertise of its skilled team.
Tata Communications provided Disney Star with advanced edge broadcast technologies, enabling Star Sports Live to be delivered in 4K for the first time on Indian set-top boxes. Additionally, it supported Disney+ Hotstar in deploying vertical feeds for the 2023 ICC Men’s ODI World Cup.
The innovation underscored the company’s focus on delivering high-quality, real-time coverage, which is of critical importance as live sports remain one of the most consumed forms of video content globally.
Following the Rs 485 crore acquisition of The Switch, a live production and video transmission company, Tata Communications opened a state-of-the-art production facility in Los Angeles which caters to the increasing global demand for live content production, strengthening the company's position in the live streaming and broadcasting industry.

2025 to mark Netflix's strongest content lineup since launching originals: Ted Sarandos,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/2025-to-mark-netflixs-strongest-content-lineup-since-launching-originals-ted-sarandos/articleshow/116323494.cms,14-12-2024,"Streaming giant
Netflix
will offer its strongest programming lineup in 2025 since it began producing original content, said co-CEO Theodore A. Sarandos, calling the coming year ""an embarrassment of riches"" for the world’s largest streaming platform, which boasts 283 million paid subscribers.
Speaking at the UBS Global TMT Conference on December 10, Sarandos shared insights into Netflix’s ambitious plans for the remainder of 2024 and for 2025.
He highlighted the return of Squid Game for its second season as a great way to end 2024. The groundbreaking series, which became a global phenomenon, will be released strategically after NFL football on Christmas Day, marking Netflix’s first-ever foray into airing football content.
""In 2025, we will have an embarrassment of riches. I mean, it's probably the strongest slate of programming we've had since we started doing original programming,"" he said, adding that, unlike prior years impacted by COVID and the Hollywood writers' strikes, 2025 will be free of such interruptions, allowing Netflix to showcase its most robust offerings.
Netflix's content lineup includes Squid Game (with another season in 2025 following the 2024 release), Stranger Things, with its fifth season set to build on the success of its predecessor, which even ranked as a top-five show in Japan; Wednesday, a global sensation; as well as returning seasons of shows like Ginny & Georgia, Emily in Paris, and 2023’s breakout hit, The Night Agent.
Live Events
The streamer’s 2025 slate also boasts an array of film projects, including Wake Up Dead Man, a new installment in the Knives Out universe; Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein; Back in Action; and The Electric State, a sci-fi epic from the Russo Brothers.
Additionally, Netflix will stream Raw, WWE's flagship weekly program, in January 2025. The $5 billion WWE rights acquisition marked its first major venture into live sports streaming.
Sarandos noted that when Netflix started, much of the world's television consumption consisted of US content that was dubbed or subtitled for international audiences. However, Netflix, when it started producing original programming, focused on creating content tailored to local markets.
The emphasis is on ""local authenticity,"" with stories deeply rooted in the cultural and social context of the regions they target. He cited Squid Game as an example of how a local Korean show achieved global success.
""Don’t try to make global content from anywhere. There’s no such thing really as global. Storytelling in a way that sometimes it's so good, it’s mostly because it’s so authentic and real. And so, if you try to manufacture a global story, you really aren’t serving the local audience or the global audience. So you’re really making something for nobody,"" he noted.
Beyond scripted series, Netflix is increasing its investment in local-language unscripted programming. Based on the success of localised unscripted content, Netflix plans to launch spin-offs and adapted formats in various markets, further leveraging the popularity of these shows.
Sarandos emphasised that Netflix approaches investments and growth by addressing the specific challenges in underpenetrated markets. The company evaluates whether barriers to growth are financial, content-related, technological, or a combination of these. The focus is on creating programming that resonates deeply with local audiences, offering a product that aligns with their economic realities, and satisfying their demand for entertainment.
He stated that even in Netflix’s most mature markets, the platform captures less than 10% of total television time, signalling significant room for growth in viewership, membership, and profitability.
Outlining Netflix's approach to sports properties, Sarandos said that the platform's interest is in unique, global, and youth-orientated sports opportunities. He noted that sports leagues also want their audiences to be more global and younger for long-term success, especially given the competition from other entertainment forms like gaming, movies, and TV.
Netflix's focus is not on acquiring specific sports leagues but on bespoke and event-driven sports content that resonates globally and captures broader audiences, he noted, highlighting the importance of making sports programming into global events.

ISPL: Jio Star signs three-year deal; Akshay Kumar's Srinagar team lands strategic partner,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ispl-jio-star-signs-three-year-deal-akshay-kumars-srinagar-team-lands-strategic-partner/articleshow/116304918.cms,14-12-2024,"The
Indian Street Premier League
(ISPL) is witnessing a surge in corporate interest, with Jio Star signing a three-year deal for commercial and media rights. Additionally, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar has sold a stake in his Srinagar team at a valuation of ₹300 crore, a senior official told ET.
Supported by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, ISPL is a T10
tennis ball cricket
league that bridges the gap between street cricket and professional stadium play.
ISPL Commissioner Suraj Samat highlighted that the partnership with Jio Star aims to expand the league’s reach and enhance its commercial value. Under the agreement, Jio Star will broadcast the league and manage monetisation across TV, digital, and on-ground platforms, retaining 25% of the revenue while ISPL retains the remaining 75%.
The first season was aired on Sony Pictures Networks India’s Sony Sports Network and SonyLIV.
Samat also noted that Akshay Kumar’s Srinagar team has drawn investments from Nepalese billionaire Binod Chaudhary’s son Rahul Chaudhary and Suhail Kannampilly of The Fern Hotels and Resorts, raising the team’s valuation to ₹300 crore, up from ₹251 crore.
Live Events
The second season of ISPL is scheduled from January 26 to February 15. Trials for season 2 spanned 55 cities, a significant increase from the 18 cities covered in the first season. “Registrations for ISPL have surged to over 30 lakh participants, highlighting its growing popularity,” Samat added.
Sachin Tendulkar, a core committee member of ISPL, commented, “It’s encouraging to see the growing interest in ISPL from across the country. Tennis ball cricket is an exciting format, and ISPL provides a competitive platform for players to showcase their skills. The inaugural season featured some outstanding performances, and this year, the league has expanded to more cities to identify emerging talent. I hope these players seize this opportunity and gain the recognition they deserve.”
ISPL plans to host matches in Chennai and Hyderabad, in addition to Thane. “We aim to expand to the southern region and eventually cover all six cities in future seasons,” Samat said.
In addition to Akshay Kumar, ISPL team owners include:
Mumbai: Amitabh Bachchan/Path India
Chennai: Actor Suriya/Route Mobile promoters
Hyderabad: Ram Charan/Prestige Estates promoter Irfan Razack
Bengaluru: Hrithik Roshan/KVN Enterprises LLP
Kolkata: Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor/Aspect Global Ventures
The six teams were sold for ₹1,165 crore under a 10-year agreement. After this period, team ownership will transition to perpetuity, with owners contributing a percentage of revenue as a franchise fee.
Plans are also underway to expand ISPL to the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia emerging as a key venue after discussions with the UAE failed to materialise. The league seeks to tap into expatriate talent and attract international viewers.
The ISPL Middle East will feature six teams from Doha, Jeddah, Muscat, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, and Bahrain. Three of the six team owners have already been secured, including Akshay Kumar (Abu Dhabi), Amitabh Bachchan (Jeddah), and Tamil actor Suriya (Doha).

The prequel
The journey to Patna began in the late 1990s, and with one phenomenon - multiplexes.
That was the start of the alienation of the mass audience from the mainstream Hindi cinema, which changed considerably in subsequent years.
What worked in the smaller confines of a multiplex was a certain genre of storytelling that clicked with urban audiences, which a new bunch of film-makers who grew up in urban environs could instantly identify with.
This contrasted with their predecessors, whose points of reference were different and who were far more grounded and aware of the world beyond the urban bubble.
They knew of the concerns and realities and dreams of people of almost all classes in the society and derived a great deal of their raw material from life, literature and lived experiences.
Consequently, their films cut across classes and geographies. Even movies like Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s
Parinda
(1989), which appealed to the urban audience, also struck a chord with the masses because of the universality of its storytelling.
That’s not quite how it worked in the world of multiplex movies.
Avijit Ghosh, a veteran journalist and author of
Cinema Bhojpuri
,
points out, “There was an explosion of a feel-good cinema which had sensibilities and style of narratives which worked with urban audiences.”
The new wave focused more on western culture and aesthetics. It also catered to Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to a great extent.
Anupama Chopra, editor,
The Hollywood Reporter India
, points out, “There are mainstream Hindi films which are set abroad and speak a language which the masses cannot understand or relate to.”
For instance, the aesthetics of thriller writer James Hadley Chase showcased in
Johnny Gaddaar
(2007) may not work with the masses, with their markedly different language, ideological references, worldview and jargon.
Simply put, the single-screen audience could not identify with this cinema.
This led to the disappearance of the commoner from mainstream Hindi films, resulting in the dwindling of those quintessential mass entertainers.
Brijesh Tandon, a film exhibitor from the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh regions, points out, “The masses want stories which contain multiple emotions, easily hummable music, and stories which can be watched along with families.”
These rich-in-imagination movies copiously incorporated the elements of Navarasa from
Natyashastra
, copiously mixing the nine emotions ranging from romance to peace, with each furthering the plot and complementing others.
Such movies were made solely with the intent to entertain. Movies like
Ghayal (1990), Krantiveer (1994)
and
Ghatak (1996)
are prime examples.
As Dr Sanjay Ranade, associate professor, Department of Communication and Journalism, University of Mumbai, underscores, “Hindi cinema as an alternative does not exist for the Hindi heartland. There is no entertainment in Hindi cinema. It is time for Hindi cinema to shut operations and go in a thinking mode.”
That is quite the indictment.
Mass entry
It is in the nature of economics that when there is demand, supply will find its way.
The journey of dubbed Telugu films into Hindi heartland began with television, and interestingly, piracy.
Ira Bhaskar, who taught cinema studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), explains, “One of the reasons why dubbed Telugu films clicked with Hindi heartland audiences is piracy. They were hardly released officially in the northern region.”
But in many areas, she says, local stores supplied dubbed Telugu films on pen drives.
Those who viewed one wanted more.
It had the cultural elements they craved for - the larger-than-life hero, action, themes, storytelling structure.
The preeminence of the hero stood out in
Telugu cinema
.
Author Mukesh Manjunath in his book
The Age of Heroes: The Incredible World of Telugu Cinema
observes, “All Indian film industries have produced stars, megastars, and superstars. But one peculiarity differentiates the Telugu film industry from others: Telugu films do not produce stars, they manufacture ‘heroes’.”
Concurring with this thought, scriptwriter Jaidev Hemmady points out, “Telugu films have a typical larger than life hero who has a devil may care attitude which strikes a chord with the North hinterland audiences whereas mainstream Bollywood has become too politically correct.”
Sarrainodu (2016)
is an example of this. In that movie, Gana, the hero, played by Allu Arjun, is a former army major who does not tolerate injustice. The story contains almost every trope that clicks with the Hindi heartland. The setting is a village. Gana is a man of principles. He is fearless. He fights for the have-nots and the oppressed.
Gana is the template for the hero the Hindi heartland craved for.
Bhaskar explains, “The Hindi heartland audience go for characters rather than actors since they do not know them well. So, the narrative of oppression, fight for justice and action genre are elements in dubbed Telugu films which work.”
The angry young man for the modern age then.
Plot twist
What also worked is the folktale structure Telugu movies tend to follow.
Take for instance, the dubbed Telugu film
Don No. 1 (2008),
a cult hit in the Hindi heartland. The film unfolds like a folk tale. Surya, the film’s hero, kills his parents’ killer. He wins because he is righteous.
As Manjunath notes in his book, “All mainstream Telugu films are folk tales. Not just the actions of these heroes, even the themes and tropes in these films stem from and are steeped in folk traditions.” He adds, “The hero (in Telugu films) does not survive because he is the hero; he is a hero because he survives.”
This kind of storytelling gives not only a sense of rootedness but also provides a great deal of familiarity in its setting for the Hindi heartland audience.
As Avijit Ghosh, author of the book
Cinema Bhojpuri
, points out, “Tropes such as a Zamindar with a henchman or a mother pining for a son, seen in old Hindi films are quite present in dubbed Telugu films. These stereotypes create a sense of familiarity with the underclass as they have been missing these elements in commercial Hindi films.”
Over the years, dubbed Telugu films also have exhibited a structure which has worked very well with non-Telugu audiences, reflected in the film’s pace and editing to its music.
Sanjay Ranade of University of Mumbai reckons that there are four key parameters which make dubbed Telugu films work in the Hindi heartland. They are slapstick comedy, crisp editing, engaging music, using interesting techniques and sound and action-oriented scenes.
Add to this the not so subtle showcasing of caste and class dynamics, along with the preeminence of family as the binding unit, and the thali is complete.
Ranade says, “In this manner, dubbed Telugu films have been creating more expansive narratives which are more generalised.”
Another aspect is their production value.
Manish Shah, owner of
Goldmines Telefilms
, a YouTube channel with more than 101 million subscribers which showcases dubbed southern languages films shares, “In dubbed Telugu films, money is invested in films and not in stars. As a result, the production value of these films is top-notch, which enhances their entertainment quotient.”
He adds, “Largely, there is not much vulgarity which makes them suitable for collective viewing especially with family.”
Add copious amounts of dishoom dishoom.
Most of these movies being action oriented also help cut across geographical boundaries of states and appeals to the Hindi belt.
As Bhaskar points out, “Telugu films focus largely on the action genre which has high engagement value and cuts across geographical boundaries.”
Ghosh adds, “Despite modern action sequences, Telugu films have retained these elements. Also, these films have a certain degree of earthiness which the Hindi heartland audience identifies. The character
Pushpa
is a case in point. He is a throwback to an old hero. One can imagine a person from eastern Uttar Pradesh or Bihar emulating
Pushpa’s
swagger.”
Climax
No wonder then, as a seasoned event management professional puts it, the Hindi heartland is now home turf for Telugu heroes. “There is nothing unusual about Allu Arjun promoting
Pushpa 2: The Rule
in Patna.
Telugu films have simply managed to achieve the masala entertainer grammar seen in mainstream Hindi films of directors Manmohan Desai and Prakash Mehra.
The Hindi heartland audience is a mass audience.
It helps that the composition of the audience in Telugu-speaking states is not materially different.
The undivided Andhra Pradesh has been a cinema-loving state. This is reflected in the number of single screens (largely associated with the masses) in the state. According to the
Film Federation of India
, the number of single screens in undivided Andhra Pradesh was 2809. The only other state with a similarly large number of single screens is Tamil Nadu (1546).
As more and more Telugu films become bolder and bigger in their technique, scale and grandeur, will this sustain?
Let’s wait for the third installment of Pushpa.

Pushpa 2 Hindi version could prove to be a hit strategy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/pushpa-2-hindi-version-could-prove-to-be-a-hit-strategy/articleshow/116019446.cms,06-12-2024,"In a year when 2024 has been disastrous at the
box office
,
Pushpa 2
: The Rule is expected to be a saving grace, resonating strongly with audiences across geographies, with exhibitors and trade analysts estimating its
Hindi dubbed version
to contribute 40-50% to its total collection (all languages), up from the 26% contribution of
Pushpa: The Rise
.
Early estimates indicate that the film could collect Rs250 crore globally on its opening day.
Amit Sharma, Managing Director at Miraj Entertainment, said, ""Pushpa 2: The Rule has lived up to the long build-up of frenzy and curiosity. In the next four days, the Hindi dubbed version alone will collect Rs280-300 crore. Overall, I believe the Hindi dubbed version will collect Rs800 crore. In fact, the Hindi dubbed version may contribute 65-70% to the film's total collection.""
Exhibitors have sold over 32 lakh tickets in
advance bookings
(worth Rs106 crore) across all languages.
Film distributor
and trade analyst Shaaminder Malik said, ""95% of shows in the non-southern markets have been allocated to the Hindi dubbed version, thanks to early positive trends.""
The film's ticket prices are 30-40% higher than usual rates. Given its immense mass appeal, favourable word-of-mouth recommendations, high occupancy levels, and no competition for the next two weeks, the higher ticket prices are expected to boost collections across all languages. Made on a budget of Rs400-500 crore, the film may achieve a lifetime collection of Rs1,200-1,400 crore across all languages, according to trade analysts.
Live Events
Girsh Wankhede, a movie trade analyst, said, ""The makers followed a blitzkrieg marketing strategy, starting with the re-release of the original film, Pushpa: The Rise, and a promotional tour in Patna. I believe the share of the dubbed Hindi version of Pushpa 2: The Rule to the total collection will be at least 40%.""

The domain name has been a talking point among the masses during this merger.
Domain names can be profitable investments, similar to real estate
. They act as online addresses directing users to websites. Valuable domains often relate to popular terms or catchy words. Investors buy these domains at low prices hoping to sell them later for a profit.
“Like any investment or trade, it involves buying domain names at a low price with the aim of selling these at a higher price. This could involve generic names, brandable names and emerging trends or keywords,” says Gaurav Sahay, Practice Head, Technology & General Corporate, Fox Mandal & Associates LLP.

Jio-Hotstar row takes a new turn: Now Jiostar.com emerges with 'coming soon' teaser
The highest domain sale ever recorded was $872 million. Domain investors watch for new technology trends to buy related domains early. While .ai domains are gaining popularity due to artificial intelligence, .com domains remain the most sought after. NameBio reports the top-selling domain in the past five years was a .com address, selling for $15.5 million. Several .ai domains like you.ai, stack.ai, and sound.ai have also sold, fetching between $250,000 and $700,000.
How it started
A Delhi-based app developer had claimed that he secured the domain name ""JioHotstar.com,"" anticipating a potential merger between Reliance's JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar.
The developer, in a letter published on the website, had reached out to Reliance Industries, proposing that the company fund his higher education in exchange for the domain.
Later, Dubai-based siblings, Jainam and Jivika, acquired the domain from the Delhi app developer.
They had offered to give the
JioHotstar domain
name to “Team Reliance” for free. The siblings stated their intention on the website: ""With all the discussions happening, we now think it might be best for Team Reliance to have this domain, if they want it. We are happy to give [JioHotstar domain] to them for free, with all the proper paperwork.""
This decision comes after the siblings received numerous offers to buy the domain, some genuine and offering significant sums. However, they maintained that the domain was never for sale.
The siblings purchased the domain to support the developer and emphasize their “seva (service) journey.” They clarified that they never intended to profit from the domain or create controversy.
Later, a new website 'Jiostar.com' also emerged with the teaser 'coming soon.'

AIFF
) on Monday signed a
commercial rights agreement
for its premier competitions, including the
I-League
and IWL, with
Shrachi Sports
Endeavour Private Limited for producing and broadcasting 338 matches in the 2024-25 season. The other events include I-League 2, Senior
National Championship
for Santosh Trophy and Senior Women's National Championship for Rajmata Jijabai Trophy.
These senior men and women club leagues and national championship matches will be streamed on the SSEN app, and 110 of the 132 I-League matches will be broadcast live on
Sony Sports Network
.
The development comes days after the I-League's 18th edition kicked off as scheduled on November 23, following a last-minute resolution to a broadcast impasse that had sparked a revolt by the participating clubs.
""This significant partnership will help
Indian football
to get necessary exposure,"" said AIFF secretary general Anilkumar Prabhakaran said in a statement.
Rahul Todi, managing director at Shrachi Sports, said, ""It is indeed a historic day for Shrachi Sports to be partnering with AIFF. This will provide a platform for men and women players to showcase their talents to national and international audiences with high quality HD content.
Live Events
""With this partnership, Shrachi shows its commitment towards being part of India's growing sports ecosystem.""
Budging to the demands of the 12 clubs just a few hours before the league's kickoff, the AIFF had said that Sony Network would broadcast the league from the second round.
However, a day before that, under the banner of I-League Clubs Association, the 12 clubs shot off a letter to the AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, warning that they would not commence the tournament until Sony Network was confirmed as the official broadcaster of the league.

"CSA targets Indian market to boost SA20 viewership, tourism",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/csa-targets-indian-market-to-boost-sa20-viewership-tourism/articleshow/115870335.cms,01-12-2024,"Cricket South Africa
(CSA) is intensifying its efforts to tap into the
Indian market
to grow the viewership of its franchise-based T20 league, SA20, and foster tourism ties between India and South Africa. According to SA20 commissioner Graeme Smith, India is the second-largest market for both CSA and SA20, reflecting its strategic importance.
“In the second season, SA20 attracted an average of 150 million viewers in India. Our goal is if we can surpass 200 million in the third season. Metrics like these, combined with promoting tourism, are critical. We’re collaborating with SA Tourism to strengthen the connection between the two nations through tourism,” Smith said in an interview with The Economic Times.
To capitalise on India’s massive sports media landscape, CSA has secured a decade-long partnership with JioStar, the entity formed from the merger of Star India and Viacom18.
Smith highlighted SA20’s ambition to establish itself as the leading cricket league outside India, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. Other key international markets include England, the Middle East, Australia, and the US.
“While the IPL remains unmatched in scale, we aim to dominate in the Southern Hemisphere and create a product that bolsters South African cricket. This league will strengthen our cricketing infrastructure and national team,” he stated.

The SA20 league is owned by Africa Cricket Development (Pty) Limited, with Cricket South Africa holding a 57.5% stake, SuperSport 30%, and former IPL COO Sundar Raman 12.5%. Notably, the involvement of IPL franchise owners has significantly enhanced the league's credibility.
The six SA20 teams include Durban’s SuperGiants (RPSG Sports), Jo’burg Super Kings (India Cements), MI Cape Town (Reliance), Paarl Royals (Rajasthan Royals), Pretoria Capitals (JSW Sports), and Sunrisers Eastern Cape (Sun TV).
""Similar to the IPL, South Africa has a strong domestic cricket base, quality stadiums, passionate fan bases, and a solid local cricket structure. This foundation is built around local talent, complemented by top international players,"" Smith said.
""South Africa benefits from a good summer schedule and a favourable time zone that aligns well with most global markets. Another key factor is the involvement of six IPL franchises, which are well-established, financially strong, and capable of maintaining competitive salary caps and investing in players,"" he added.
Smith underscored the league’s financial health, stating that SA20 is exceeding budget projections across all metrics. Franchises are adopting a phased profitability approach, and sustained year-on-year growth is expected to secure long-term commercial success, he added.
The league has revitalised domestic cricket in South Africa, drawing nearly 400,000 fans to stadiums last season—an attendance milestone not achieved since the 1990s. This surge in popularity also strengthens opportunities for South African players, with talents like Ottneil Baartman breaking onto the global stage.
Economically, SA20’s impact on the local economy has been substantial. The second season generated $238 million for South Africa’s GDP, an increase from $227 million in its inaugural year, according to independent reports. Gains in employment, GDP contributions, and direct expenditure underscore the league’s significance as a major annual event in South Africa.
Smith also said that the CSA wants to establish SA20 before thinking about expanding it with new teams. ""We have planned to use the first five years to establish the league and let the franchises grow, as we're still very new. Expansion also depends on having a strong enough player pool to maintain competition. This year is crucial for our growth, as it will help clarify our future vision. We don’t want to expand just for the sake of it; new teams must add value to the event,"" he added.

Hockey India inks three-year deal with Doordarshan for Hockey India League,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/hockey-india-inks-three-year-deal-with-doordarshan-for-hockey-india-league/articleshow/115868519.cms,01-12-2024,"Hockey India
has signed a landmark three-year partnership with
Doordarshan
(DD), ensuring comprehensive nationwide coverage of the
Hockey India League
(HIL). Discussions are also underway with private broadcasters to expand the league’s reach further.
Speaking about the collaboration, Bhola Nath Singh, Governing Committee Member of HIL and Secretary General of Hockey India, expressed confidence in the league’s broadcast strategy. “The partnership with Doordarshan is a testament to our vision of promoting hockey as *India ka khel*. With DD’s unparalleled reach, we are ensuring that no fan is left behind,” he stated.
While Doordarshan was the first broadcaster to join hands with HIL, Singh reassured that private broadcasters are also optimistic about the league’s prospects. “Our strategy prioritises maximum coverage and engagement. We will have two linear broadcast partners and multiple streaming platforms to cater to diverse demographics. Details about additional partners will be announced soon,” Singh said.
The league promises to deliver world-class production quality, expert commentary, and in-depth analysis, ensuring fans enjoy an immersive and visually engaging experience.
The financial sustainability of the HIL, a key focus for stakeholders, extends beyond broadcasting revenues. Singh outlined a robust sponsorship model, innovative partnerships, and a strong emphasis on digital and on-ground fan engagement as critical components of the league’s viability.
Live Events
“The resurgence of hockey, especially after India’s consecutive Olympic medal wins, has sparked immense interest from corporate sponsors and fans alike. This momentum, coupled with meticulous planning, ensures the league’s long-term success,” he added.
Hockey India is expected to announce its title sponsor shortly, further solidifying the league’s commercial foundation.
In October, Hockey India officially relaunched the HIL after a seven-year hiatus. The 2024-25 edition will mark the return of the men’s hockey league and the debut of a standalone women’s hockey league.
Starting in 2024-25, the HIL will feature eight men’s teams and six women’s teams, with the women’s league running concurrently with the men’s competition.
Prominent sports entities have already invested in franchises across both leagues.
JSW Sports
, SG Sports and Entertainment (owned by former Indian tennis star Mahesh Bhupathi), and Navoyam Sports Ventures are among the early investors.
The owners of the men’s franchises are, Chennai – Charles Group, Lucknow – Yadu Sports, Punjab – JSW Sports, West Bengal – Shrachi Sports, Delhi – SG Sports and Entertainment, Odisha –
Vedanta
, Hyderabad – Resolute Sports, and Ranchi – Navoyam Sports Ventures.
The owners of the women’s franchises include Haryana – JSW Sports, West Bengal – Shrachi Sports, Delhi – SG Sports and Entertainment, and Odisha – Navoyam Sports Ventures. Two additional women’s franchises will be announced following the resolution of ongoing legal proceedings.
Two additional women’s franchises will be announced following the resolution of ongoing legal proceedings.
The franchise fee for a men’s team has been set at Rs 7 crore per year, while the fee for a women’s team will be Rs 3 crore per year, reflecting the league’s commitment to promoting both men’s and women’s hockey in India.

JioStar bags English Premier League rights,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/jiostar-bags-english-premier-league-rights/articleshow/115831663.cms,30-11-2024,"The English
Premier League
(
EPL
), one of the world’s top sports leagues, has finalised a three-year media rights deal with
JioStar
for the Indian market, starting with the 2025-26 season, said people familiar with the development.
JioStar, the newly merged entity of Star India and Viacom18, is backed by key stakeholders
Reliance Industries
, Walt Disney, and Bodhi Tree Systems.
The people cited above said the deal is worth $65 million, comprising $54 million as rights fee and $11 million marketing commitment to promote EPL events in India during the period of the contract. It represents a slight increase from the current $60 million agreement spanning 2022-2025, which includes $50 million in rights fees and $10 million in marketing commitment.
JioStar and EPL declined to comment.
The Premier League was in talks with other Indian broadcasters including Sony, FanCode—owned by Dream Sports, and Eurosport. It eventually agreed on the deal with JioStar after Star didn't show any inclination to renew the rights.
Live Events
Sony has established itself as a major buyer of football broadcasting rights, positioning itself as the ""home of football"" with properties such as the UEFA Euro and the UEFA Champions League. Viacom18 had secured the broadcasting rights for the FIFA World Cup 2022.
The value of EPL’s Indian media rights has seen a steady decline over the past decade. After peaking at $145 million for the 2013-2016 cycle, the rights value dropped to $100 million (2016-2019), $81 million (2019-2022), and $60 million for the current cycle. This decline is attributed to reduced competition, falling television viewership, monetisation challenges, and waning interest from rival broadcasters.
The announcement tracks Culver Max Entertainment (Sony Pictures Networks India) securing the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) media rights for $170 million, the reserve price, for an eight-year period through 2031. Cricket remains a dominant force in the Indian sports broadcasting market, overshadowing other sports properties like football.
Despite the challenges, EPL remains a premium property in India, with strong subscription-driven monetisation potential. Globally, football clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City, Real Madrid, and FC Barcelona enjoy strong popularity in India, as per YouGov’s FootballIndex.
Sports business experts suggest that while the Premier League’s rights value has fallen, it remains an attractive proposition at a sustainable price point.

Sony bags Asian Cricket Council media rights for $170 million till 2031,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-bags-asian-cricket-council-media-rights-till-2031/articleshow/115566675.cms,22-11-2024,"Culver Max Entertainment, also known as
Sony Pictures Networks India
(SPNI), has secured the
Asian Cricket Council
(ACC) media rights for $170 million, the reserve price for the property, for the next eight years, until 2031.
SPNI was the only company to bid for the rights, as
JioStar
, the other competitor, opted out of the e-auction. Star India was the previous media rights holder, having paid roughly $80–90 million for the
ACC media rights
from 2016 to 2023.
Experts suggest JioStar opted out of the auction because it already owns the media rights to several major cricketing events, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), the International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) matches, Cricket South Africa, and Cricket Australia.
“Acquiring ACC media rights wouldn’t have brought any incremental gains to JioStar on either TV or digital platforms,” said a sports broadcast expert.
The acquisition strengthens SPNI’s cricket portfolio, which already includes media rights for the England and Wales Cricket Board, New Zealand Cricket, and Sri Lanka Cricket.
Live Events
“This is a major win for us because the ACC media rights include the India-Pakistan games, which are the most sought-after matches. We have made a financially prudent investment, and this property has immense value,” SPNI MD and CEO
Gaurav Banerjee
told ET.
ACC President Jay Shah described the deal with SPNI as a significant milestone for cricket in the region. “The Asia Cup continues to be a cornerstone of cricketing excellence, bringing together the best of the region’s talent,” he said.
Banerjee also noted the deal’s potential to enhance SPNI’s TV and digital businesses. He emphasised that India is a market where both TV and digital platforms can coexist and grow.
“We’ve seen the power of live cricket on digital platforms and the continued strength of premium cricket on linear TV. We believe both can grow simultaneously,” he said.
The agreement covers all editions of the Men’s and Women’s Asia Cups across television, digital, and audio platforms. Four editions of the Men’s Asia Cup are scheduled for 2025, 2027, 2029, and 2031, with India expected to host the Asia Cup in 2024.
Banerjee added that SPNI’s cricket calendar, featuring rights to ACC, New Zealand Cricket, England Cricket, and Sri Lanka Cricket, looks strong. Next year, the network plans to showcase India’s tour of England and the Asia Cup.
According to a recent Google-Deloitte report, cricket remains India’s most popular sport, with a fan base of 492 million. Other sports, such as kabaddi (120 million fans), football (85 million), hockey (70 million), and badminton (60 million), are also gaining traction.

In a statement, ANI said, ""The court is required to decide the legitimacy of the use of publicly available proprietary content by AI platforms.""
In its court submission dated Monday, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, ANI also accused ChatGPT of attributing fabricated news stories to the publication.

India focussed on developing content creators' economy: Ashwini Vaishnaw,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/india-focussed-on-developing-content-creators-economy-ashwini-vaishnaw/articleshow/115496965.cms,20-11-2024,"Panaji, Information and Broadcasting Minister
Ashwini Vaishnaw
on Wednesday said India was focussed on developing the content creators' economy, showcasing the country's rich heritage and culture, and diversity of languages and literature. In his video address at the inaugural event of the
International Film Festival of India
(IFFI) here,
Vaishnaw
said with the addition of technology and development of creators' ecosystem, India can play a major role in the media and entertainment sector globally.
""We in India at this point in time are very much focussed on developing content creators' economy. We have a very vibrant creators' economy where people are coming up with very innovative content showcasing some of the very rich heritage of India, the cuisines of India, the culture of India and the gems of Indian language and literature,"" he said.
The 55th edition of IFFI began here with a glittering opening ceremony at Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium here.
In an article, Vaishnaw said India's creative economy has emerged as a USD 30 billion industry, contributing nearly 2.5 per cent of GDP and providing livelihood to eight per cent of the workforce.
""With a thriving influencer marketing sector valued at Rs 3,375 crore, and over 200,000 full-time content creators, this industry is a dynamic force driving India's global aspirations,"" he said.
Live Events
Vaishnaw said more cities such as Guwahati, Kochi and Indore are becoming creative epicenters, fueling a decentralized creative revolution.
India's 110 crore internet users and 70 crore social media users are driving democratization of creativity.
Vaishnaw said the creative economy has a profound influence that extends well beyond GDP growth and significantly impacted various sectors, including tourism, hospitality and technology by supporting ancillary industries.
""Additionally, digital platforms empower marginalized voices, promoting social inclusion, diversity and the preservation of cultural heritage,"" he said.

Indian news agency ANI sues OpenAI for unsanctioned content use in AI training,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/indian-news-agency-ani-sues-openai-for-unsanctioned-content-use-in-ai-training/articleshow/115449107.cms,20-11-2024,"Indian news agency ANI
has sued OpenAI in a New Delhi court, accusing the ChatGPT creator of using its published content without permission to help train the artificial intelligence chatbot, something that OpenAI says it has stopped doing.
ANI is the latest news organisation globally to take OpenAI to court following lawsuits in the U.S. by newspapers including the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.
The first hearing in the case took place in the New Delhi High Court on Tuesday, where the judge issued a notice to OpenAI to provide a detailed response to ANI's accusations.
In a statement, ANI said ""the court is required to decide the legitimacy of the use of publicly available proprietary content by AI platforms.""
ANI also accused OpenAI's ChatGPT of attributing fabricated news stories to the publication, according to its court submission dated Monday, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.
Live Events
The court filing contained emails sent by OpenAI's lawyers in India to ANI saying the Indian news agency's website had been placed on an internal block list since September, ceasing usage of its content in future training of AI models.
ANI, however, argues that its published works are ""permanently stored in the memory of ChatGPT"" and ""there is no programmed deletion"".
Asked about the ANI lawsuit, a spokesperson for OpenAI said in a statement: ""We build our AI models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by long-standing and widely accepted legal precedents"".
OpenAI and other tech companies have faced a wave of lawsuits by authors, visual artists, music publishers and other copyright owners for allegedly exploiting their work without permission. OpenAI has denied copyright infringement.
ANI in its filing said that OpenAI had ""refused to obtain a lawful license or permission"" for the use of original works by ANI.
The media firm is concerned about unfair competition as OpenAI has commercial partnerships with other news organisations to distribute their content, ANI said in its statement.
The AI firm has entered into licensing arrangements with news organisations such as the Financial Times and Associated Press for similar use of copyrighted content, it said.
A spokesperson for Reuters, which holds a 26% interest in ANI, said it was not involved in ANI's business practices or operations.
In its statement, OpenAI said that it was engaged in partnerships with many news organisations around the world and was holding talks to explore more, similar opportunities, including in India.
The court is set to next hear the case on Jan. 28.

CCI slaps penalty of Rs 213 crore on Meta for abusing dominant position,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/cci-slaps-penalty-of-rs-213-crore-on-meta-for-abusing-dominant-position/articleshow/115427686.cms,19-11-2024,"The
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) on Monday slapped a penalty of Rs 213.14 crore on Meta, the US-based firm which owns WhatsApp, for alleged abuse of its
dominant position
in the implementation of the messaging app’s 2021 privacy policy.
In an order, the
antitrust regulator
said that user data was collected and shared with other Meta companies in contravention of the competition law. It asked Meta and WhatsApp to implement certain behavioural remedies within a defined timeline, on top of issuing cease-and-desist directions for these entities.
“The Commission has concluded that the 2021 policy update by WhatsApp on a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ basis constitutes an imposition of unfair condition under the Act, as it compels all users to accept expanded data collection terms and sharing of data within Meta Group without any opt out,” the regulator said in a statement issued separately.
WhatsApp started notifying users from January 2021 about updates to its terms of service and privacy policies. And the in-app notification stated that, with effect from February 8 that year, users were required to accept the terms, including expanded scope of data collection as well as mandatory
data sharing
with Meta companies, to continue using WhatsApp.
Under the August 2016 privacy policy, WhatsApp users were given the option to decide whether they wanted to share their data with Facebook. However, with the 2021 policy update, WhatsApp made data sharing with Meta mandatory for all users, removing the earlier option to opt out.

“Given the network effects and lack of effective alternatives, the 2021 update forces users to comply, undermining their autonomy, and constitutes an abuse of Meta’s dominant position,” the CCI said.
The regulator also said that sharing of WhatsApp users’ data between Meta companies for purposes other than providing WhatsApp Service “creates an entry barrier for the rivals of Meta and thus, results in denial of market access in the display advertisement market”.
Meta, it added, “engaged in leveraging its dominant position in the OTT (over-the-top) messaging apps through smartphones to protect its position in the online display advertising market” in contravention of the competition law.
Remedial steps
Suggesting remedial measures, the regulator asked WhatsApp not to share user data with other Meta companies or Meta company products for advertising purposes, for five years.
For sharing of user data for non-advertising purposes, WhatsApp’s policy should include a detailed explanation, linking each type of data to its corresponding purpose, the CCI said.
Users must have the flexibility to opt out of non-service-related data sharing through in-app notifications and app settings, it said, adding that all future policy updates must also comply with these transparency and opt-out requirements.

"ZEE's Punit Goenka to resign as MD, stay on as CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zees-punit-goenka-to-resign-as-md-stay-on-as-ceo/articleshow/115427148.cms,19-11-2024,"Mumbai: Punit Goenka, the current Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
(ZEEL), has decided to step down from the MD role to focus exclusively on his responsibilities as CEO, according to a company statement.
Goenka will remain on the board as a Director, pending shareholder approval, the statement said, adding that the board has approved his request, citing the need for dedicated focus on ZEEL's operational growth strategy.
This decision precedes a significant shareholder vote scheduled for November 28 regarding Goenka's reappointment as MD and CEO for a new five-year term commencing in January 2025.
In line with this transition, Mukund Galgali, the current Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has been promoted to Deputy CEO while retaining his CFO duties. These changes take effect immediately, reflecting the company's aim to streamline its leadership structure and sharpen its focus on core business operations.
Goenka's decision is aimed at enhancing profitability and improving operational efficiency, consistent with ZEEL's broader objectives of revenue growth and stronger financial performance. The board expressed confidence in his leadership, linking his remuneration to higher performance metrics.
Live Events
The board has set ambitious performance metrics for Goenka's variable pay, with 40% tied to these enhanced targets. Should Goenka exceed the targets by over 100%, he may receive additional variable compensation, subject to a cap.
The board underscored its focus on accountability, stating it will closely monitor his performance against these benchmarks to ensure value creation for shareholders.
In a regulatory filing on November 15, the ZEEL board announced revised performance targets for Goenka's reappointment. These include quarterly consolidated revenue and
EBITDA
goals for the next four quarters, starting from Q3 of FY25. Additionally, the board has committed to distributing 25% of consolidated net profits as dividends to shareholders.
Commenting on his decision, Punit Goenka said, ""The company remains on a firm footing and is taking all the necessary steps to build a robust foundation for its future. In order to ensure we maintain a sharp focus on achieving our targeted aspirations, the core businesses require dedicated time and energy which can only be achieved in an operational capacity. In the long-term interest of the company and all its stakeholders, I have approached the Board with a request to attain operational focus as the CEO. I am grateful to the Board for recognising my efforts and supporting me in this approach.""
R Gopalan, chairman of ZEEL, expressed support for Goenka's move, stating, ""The Board appreciates the approach taken by Punit Goenka to sharpen his focus towards enhancing the operational aspects of the company as the CEO. His expertise and business acumen remain unmatched, and we remain confident in his abilities to deliver immense value to the Company and all its stakeholders in the position he assumes. On behalf of the board, I wish him immense luck and success going forward.""

BARC India sees 44% decline in FY24 profit to Rs 20 crore,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/barc-india-sees-44-decline-in-fy24-profit-to-rs-20-crore/articleshow/115406104.cms,18-11-2024,"The
Broadcast Audience Research Council
(BARC), India's official TV audience measurement body, reported a 44% drop in profit after tax for 2023-24 to Rs 20 crore, according to regulatory filings.
Revenue fell a marginal 0.6%, down to Rs 319 crore from Rs 321 crore in the previous fiscal.
BARC, a critical player in India's
media industry
, derives 75% of its revenue from broadcasters. It charges a fee based on a fixed percentage of advertising revenues, helping maintain stable cash flow as clients are billed quarterly in advance.
Three major industry associations support BARC: the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation owns a 60% stake, while the Indian Society of Advertisers and the Advertising Agencies Association of India own 20% each.
BARC’s ratings serve as a benchmark for advertising decisions in the TV broadcasting industry. The firm employs advanced watermarking technology with a panel base of around 60,000 '
Bar-O meters
' for data collection.
Live Events
Meterology Data Pvt Ltd (MDPL), responsible for deploying and maintaining BARC’s Bar-O-meters, reported a 60% decline in net profit for 2023-24 to Rs 2 crore, with revenue falling 2% to Rs 105 crore.
MDPL, in which BARC holds a 51% stake, and TAM Media Research the remaining 49%, manages around 55,000 panels and 2,500 out-of-home meters, collecting data across urban and rural India.
The company uses locally manufactured Bar-O-meters that transmit data in real-time via GSM networks, supported by a robust IT infrastructure and field staff network.
CRISIL Ratings
reaffirmed its stable rating on BARC's long-term bank facilities, projecting operating profit to be Rs 20-30 crore going forward. It withdrew its rating on MDPL’s long-term bank facilities at the company's request, following receipt of no-dues certificates.
The rating agency also withdrew its rating on a Rs 7.05 crore long-term loan, following repayment, and on proposed bank facilities of Rs 7.95 crore at BARC’s request.
The reaffirmed rating reflects BARC's strong business model, high revenue visibility, strategic importance to member entities and solid financial risk profile, tempered by weak operating profitability.
CRISIL highlighted the ongoing review of TV audience measurement guidelines by the information and broadcasting ministry based on the
Telecom Regulatory Authority
of India's recommendations from April 2020. Any changes impacting BARC’s status as the sole provider of TV viewership metrics could affect its rating outlook, it added.
However, CRISIL said high capital requirements and regulatory approvals create strong barriers to entry in this business.
As of September 30, 2024, BARC had cash reserves of Rs 100 crore against a debt of Rs 5 crore. Future capital expenditure needs will be funded through internal accruals, working capital limits and existing cash reserves.

NBA
have settled a contentious legal dispute concerning broadcasting rights, marking a significant shift in their long-standing partnership.
Under the terms of the new agreement, Warner Bros. Discovery will continue its coverage of NBA content, but with a focus on digital platforms and international markets, while conceding US TV game rights to competitors, as per
Variety
.
The 11-year deal resolves the lawsuit Warner had filed against the NBA after the league decided to exclude the media giant from its new broadcasting arrangements.
The NBA's new TV rights package, which includes Disney's ESPN, Amazon, and NBCUniversal, had left Warner on the sidelines for its domestic game broadcasts, which it has carried since 1989.
Despite this, Warner Bros. Discovery will retain the rights to showcase NBA highlights and content through its Bleacher Report and House of Highlights platforms, as per Variety.

Additionally, the company will continue to distribute NBA games in international markets, including Northern Europe and parts of Latin America, though Brazil and Mexico will remain outside its coverage area.
The settlement marks a shift in Warner's strategy, as the company pivots to a greater emphasis on digital and international NBA content.
According to Variety, sources familiar with the matter, Warner's new agreement with the NBA will allow the company to manage the league's digital properties, which it has done for over three decades.
This includes continuing to provide NBA highlights and digital coverage to a global audience.
While Warner loses the lucrative rights to air NBA games in the US, the deal provides an opportunity for significant international exposure, especially in regions where the NBA continues to grow in popularity.
As per Variety, one source estimated that Warner Bros. Discovery could see up to USD 100 million in profits from the first five years of the new agreement, as its international distribution and digital media coverage take centre stage.
In a separate arrangement, Warner Bros. Discovery has struck a deal to make its popular ""Inside the NBA"" studio show available to ESPN during key points of the NBA season.
This collaboration will allow ESPN to leverage Warner's expertise and iconic personalities like Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal, as part of its broader NBA coverage.
Variety reported that the new deal also expands Warner's sports footprint, with rights to broadcast Big 12 football and men's basketball games, marking a new chapter in the company's sports broadcasting efforts.
""Inside the NBA,"" which remains a staple of Warner's NBA programming, will also be considered for expansion into other sports as Warner explores new avenues for the show's reach.
The settlement helps Warner avoid a prolonged and costly legal battle with the NBA. Without a resolution, both parties faced a potentially lengthy court fight that could have extended well into next season.
While NBA executives were confident they would prevail in the courts, the legal drama could have undermined the relationship between the two, with Warner losing access to a prime revenue source.
Warner's cable operations, particularly its flagship TNT network, have long relied on NBA broadcasts to drive advertising sales.
According to Variety, NBA games accounted for much of TNT's top programming in 2023, making the loss of domestic broadcast rights a blow to its revenue stream.
Warner had already taken a hit earlier in 2023, reportedly writing down USD 9.1 billion of its TV assets, including the expected loss of NBA game broadcasts when the NBA's new TV contract kicks in next season.
Despite the setback, Warner continues to hold valuable sports rights, including those for the French Open, NASCAR, and the College Football Playoff (CFP), securing deals that help diversify its sports portfolio amid the changing media landscape.

Disney incurs $1.5-b impairment charge on Star India deal in FY24,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-incurs-1-5-b-impairment-charge-on-star-india-deal-in-fy24/articleshow/115343252.cms,16-11-2024,"Walt Disney said it incurred a non-cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024 under restructuring and impairment charges related to the Star India transaction, reflecting a fair value adjustment of its Star India business. Disney follows the October to September financial calendar.
In a regulatory filing, the company said this impairment includes non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses of around $800 million. It also said it will recognise a non-cash tax charge of approximately $300 million in connection with the close of the transaction between Star and Reliance Industries Limited's (RIL) Viacom18.
""Star India’s assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2024, and we recorded $1.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges in ‘restructuring and impairment charges’ in fiscal 2024 to reflect Star India at its fair value less costs to sell,"" Walt Disney said.
""The measurement of these impairment charges included non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses of approximately $0.8 billion. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we anticipate we will recognise a non-cash tax charge of approximately $0.3 billion in connection with the close of the transaction,"" it added.
The merger deal between RIL and Disney to combine the assets of Star India and Viacom18 closed on November 14. The merged entity JioStar, valued at $8.5 billion, will be controlled by RIL with 56% interest, while Disney will retain 37%, and Bodhi Tree Systems, an investment firm, will hold a 7% stake.

The company has been consolidating Star India’s income statement and cash flow activities until the transaction closed.
Post-completion of the merger deal, the company will recognise its 37% stake in the joint venture at fair value on its balance sheet and start reporting its share of the joint venture’s earnings under ‘equity in the income of investees, net’, rather than including it in the segments’ operating results.
Star India, which was earlier fully owned by Walt Disney, incurred a standalone net loss of Rs 12,548 crore in the last financial year ending March 31. In a regulatory filing, the broadcaster blamed the weak financial performance to a provision of Rs 12,319 crore for an ""onerous contract"" stemming from the International Cricket Council (ICC) media rights deal.
In fiscal 2024, Star India’s sports business reported a 47% increase in operating losses, totalling $636 million, Walt Disney's filings show. Despite this, revenue grew by 15% to $841 million, driven by a 40% surge in sports advertising revenue, which reached $444 million.
The growth was primarily due to the broadcasting of two major ICC cricket tournaments in the current year, compared to one in the previous year. However, affiliate revenue declined by 13% to $238 million, affected by reduced effective rates and a smaller subscriber base.
Programming and production expenses soared by 32% to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by increased costs for cricket programming.
The cost spike was attributed to the airing of two major ICC tournaments this fiscal year. This increase was somewhat offset by the absence of costs related to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) cricket programming, as the company did not renew those rights.
Disney operates 10 Star branded sports channels in India, in four languages. Star has rights to various sports programming, primarily cricket and soccer. As of September 2024, the estimated number of subscribers to Star branded channels, based on internal management reports, was approximately 79 million.
In fiscal 2025, Disney is anticipating an increase of approximately $875 million in its entertainment DTC operating income compared to fiscal 2024, which includes a comparison against an adverse impact of around $200 million from its India DTC business on fiscal 2024 entertainment DTC results. Additionally, Disney+ Hotstar’s subscriber base grew by 1%, reaching 35.9 million.
Disney has various contractual commitments for rights to sports, films and other programming, totalling approximately $92.2 billion, including approximately $2.6 billion for available programming as of September 28, 2024.
However, this excludes commitments related to Star India businesses that are held for sale of approximately $4.5 billion, primarily related to sports programming rights, Disney said.

Govt clears consideration of private member's Bill on independent media licensing authority,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/govt-clears-consideration-of-private-members-bill-on-independent-media-licensing-authority/articleshow/115333792.cms,15-11-2024,"New Delhi: A private member's Bill that seeks to provide for establishment of an independent authority for the regulation and licensing of
media
services in the country has been cleared for consideration by the Rajya Sabha, a bulletin of the House said. The
Indian Media
Services (Regulation and Licensing) Bill, 2024, a private member's bill by CPI(M) MP V Sivadasan, provides for establishing an independent authority -- the Indian Board of Media Services -- for the regulation and licensing of media services ""to facilitate development of free and independent media services in the country"".
According to the bulletin, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw communicated to the Rajya Sabha secretary-general that the president has recommended the consideration of the Bill to the House.
Private members' Bills involving expenditure from the exchequer require the president's permission through the ministry concerned on whether such bills can be considered by the House.
The Indian Media Services (Regulation and Licensing) Bill says the Central government shall, within six months of the commencement of this Act, by notification in the Official Gazette, establish for the purposes of this Act, an autonomous body to be known as the Indian Board for Media Services, to regulate the functioning of media services and foster free and independent media services in the country.
It also says the Central government shall, after due appropriation made by Parliament by law on this behalf, make to the Board grants of such sums of money as the Central government may think fit for carrying out the purposes of this Act.

In the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill, Sivadasan has said independent media that plays an impartial role in the dissemination of news and information to the public at large is crucial for the functioning of a healthy democracy, and licensing powers being a monopoly in the hands of the Executive often results in a ""pliant media"", as journalists will hesitate to criticize the ruling dispensation for fear of legal hazards.
The Bill states the licensing should not be left to bureaucracy and the ruling party, and aims to correct this by proposing an autonomous body for issuing licences and revoking them, thus ensuring free and fair functioning of media.

The merger consolidates the media and JioCinema businesses of Viacom18 into Star India Private Limited (SIPL), creating one of India’s largest media entities.
The combined entity will have approximately Rs 26,000 crore in pro forma combined revenue for the fiscal year ending in March 2024.

Our deep creative expertise and relationship with Disney, along with our unmatched understanding of the Indian consumer will ensure unparalleled content choices at affordable prices for Indian viewers,"" he said.
Disney CEO Robert A.

Media consumption in rural India is becoming increasingly hybrid: GroupM-Kantar,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/media-consumption-in-rural-india-is-becoming-increasingly-hybrid-groupm-kantar/articleshow/115172359.cms,11-11-2024,"Media consumption in rural India
is becoming increasingly hybrid, with nearly half of
rural consumers
engaging with both online and offline channels, according to the latest
Rural Barometer Report
released by WPP’s media investment group, GroupM, in partnership with Kantar, a leading global marketing data and analytics firm.
The report marks the fifth edition of the Rural Barometer, offering fresh insights into the evolving media landscape and consumer behaviour in rural India. It underscores a notable shift towards a blended media approach, driven by rising internet penetration and digital adoption in rural areas.
The findings reveal that digital and telecom platforms are providing significant incremental reach, particularly in Hindi-speaking regions. Rural consumers are increasingly embracing online platforms, making digital an essential component of effective media strategies for brands targeting this vast market segment.
“Telecom and digital channels are proving to be vital in reaching rural audiences, especially in regions where traditional media may have limited coverage,” the report states. “The trend towards
hybrid media consumption
highlights the need for a balanced strategy that combines both online and offline engagement.”
The report also highlights a surge in the use of digital services among rural users. Digital platforms for payments, e-commerce, and gaming have seen a significant rise in popularity, reflecting growing digital inclusion and financial literacy in rural communities.

In addition, rural online users are increasingly drawn to lifestyle-oriented content, including fashion, travel, and fitness. This trend points to a shift in interests, with rural consumers now seeking content that aligns with their aspirations and enhances their everyday lives.
Ajay Mehta, Managing Director of GroupM OOH Solutions in India, noted the changing landscape: “Rural India is emerging as a digital frontier. Brands need to recognise this shift and tailor their strategies to engage rural consumers effectively. By tapping into digital platforms and addressing the evolving preferences of rural audiences, businesses can unlock substantial growth opportunities.”
The report suggests that while traditional media continues to hold influence in rural India, a hybrid approach combining online and offline channels is key to reaching a broader audience. By understanding the evolving media habits and preferences of rural consumers, brands can craft more effective campaigns and drive meaningful engagement in these markets.
The findings from the Rural Barometer Report indicate that the
digital transformation in rural India
is well underway, offering brands a unique chance to connect with a rapidly growing and increasingly digital-savvy audience.
The report also highlights a significant 60% increase in the average FMCG basket size among rural consumers, rising from 5.8 in 2022 to 9.3 in 2024. This growth is attributed to an increasing preference for convenience products, reflecting changing lifestyles and enhanced purchasing power in rural areas.
Regional differences are evident, with states such as Jammu & Kashmir (39%), Maharashtra (41%), and Odisha (26%) witnessing moderate growth in FMCG basket sizes, despite fewer financial concerns. This positive trend in expanding FMCG consumption is supported by rising rural incomes and a diversification of income sources, including salaried employment.
The report also reveals a distinct disparity between rural residents reliant solely on agricultural income (19% of the population) and those with diverse income streams (81%). Those depending exclusively on agricultural income face greater financial stress, with 82% expressing concerns. In contrast, individuals with varied income sources show reduced financial stress and exhibit larger basket sizes.
Puneet Avasthi, Director of Specialist Businesses, Insights Division, Kantar, added: “The 2024 Rural Barometer Report illustrates rising purchasing power and evolving lifestyles among rural consumers, as evidenced by increased basket sizes and a preference for convenience products, despite ongoing financial concerns. Regional variations in financial resilience are influenced by the availability of diverse employment opportunities. We also observe a shift in rural media consumption towards a hybrid model of traditional and digital formats, though digital access remains uneven across different states.”

Disney Star's distribution head Gurjeev Kapoor leaves before Reliance-Star India merger: Sources,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-disney-merger-news-disney-stars-distribution-head-gurjeev-kapoor-leaves-before-reliance-star-india-merger/articleshow/115169414.cms,11-11-2024,"Reliance-Star India Merger:
Gurjeev Kapoor
, Head of Distribution and International Markets at Disney Star, has likely decided to leave the company to pursue entrepreneurial ambitions in the entertainment sector. Kapoor's departure comes as the $8.5 billion merger between Reliance and Disney’s Indian assets nears finalization, sources close to the development informed ET Online.
""Gurjeev Kapoor has chosen not to accept a role in the Viacom18/Disney Star joint venture, opting instead to pursue an entrepreneurial career in the entertainment space,"" sources told ET Online.
Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance had in February this year signed a binding agreement with Disney to merge the media operations in India, the world's most populous country with diverse demography that consumes high volume of media content.
The merger between Reliance Industries Limited's (RIL) Viacom18 and Walt Disney's Star India is expected to be finalised in early November after receiving regulatory approvals in India, ET had reported citing sources familiar with the situation. This merger will form the largest media and entertainment conglomerate in India, valued at $8.5 billion. As part of the deal, Viacom18 will transfer its assets to Star India, which will operate as the main company following the merger.
Kapoor spearheaded TV distribution for Disney Star across India and numerous international markets. Overseeing operations in more than 109 countries, he expanded the network's presence across key regions, including the UK, Europe, the U.S., Middle East, Africa, and APAC. Kapoor was instrumental in managing a revenue line exceeding $600 million, a feat he achieved despite the ongoing shift from linear Pay TV to digital platforms.

He has been instrumental in making sports more accessible to Indian audiences by driving widespread adoption of the Star Sports portfolio across semi-urban and rural areas, as well as in multiple regional languages. He also led efforts to establish a solid presence for the regional portfolio, ensuring strategic reach and strong market foothold in southern and other regional areas.
One of Kapoor's notable accomplishments at Disney Star was his leadership of Disney+ Hotstar’s partnership business. He significantly broadened its reach by tripling partnerships with telecom operators, ISPs, and OTT aggregators. These efforts helped solidify Disney+ Hotstar as India's top OTT player with the most extensive partnership network, making the platform accessible in more homes nationwide.
During his tenure, Kapoor also played a pivotal role in increasing subscription revenue by 25% per consumer over five years, despite the industry-wide decline in Pay TV subscribers. His forward-thinking approach and collaboration with industry stakeholders have contributed to curbing piracy and establishing transparency within the sector.
Kapoor also led distribution initiatives for major media companies like Sony, ESPN Star Sports, and Discovery.

"India emerging as good opportunity market for Sony's gaming biz, says India MD",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/india-emerging-as-good-opportunity-market-for-sonys-gaming-biz-says-india-md/articleshow/115137141.cms,10-11-2024,"India is emerging as a ""good opportunity market"" in the gaming business for the consumer electronic major Sony, its India Managing Director Sunil Nayyar said. The company has reported ""phenomenal growth"" in the gaming business in FY24, with the robust performance of PlayStation 5 and its software peripherals.
Sony India's PlayStation dominates the console operating gaming system market here with around 95 per cent market share and has almost doubled its revenue in FY 2023-24 from the segment. However, now, it expects a moderation in the growth rates because of the high base, Nayyar said.
""Now, the base is very high because we almost achieved the double business last year. So this year, we intend to have modest growth, but we are developing the gaming business market in the country, including software development and peripherals etc,"" the Sony India MD told PTI.
Sony India last week filed its annual returns to report over 50.1 per cent growth from its 'other business' segment at Rs 1,363.54 crore, which houses its gaming and B2B business.
""This is largely led by the gaming business. It gave us a phenomenal growth. There is no doubt about it. PlayStation 5 and our software peripherals, everything did very well.
Live Events
""So, India is now becoming a very good opportunity market for gaming for Sony... We have 95 per cent in the market today as far as PS5 is concerned. We have a very strong brand here for the gaming business,"" Nayyar said.
Besides, Sony is also doing well in some other niche segments such as medical equipment and its sports business, where it sells Hawk-Eye systems, used in all major sporting events, including cricket, tennis, football, badminton, rugby and volleyball to visually track the trajectory of a ball and display a profile of its statistically most likely path as a moving image.
""We are also growing in various niche segments like medical equipment, where we sell a lot of products (such as Microdisplays) and even sports business, where we sell Hawk-Eye. So, even sports business is doing very well,"" he noted.
Sony India's revenue from Consumer Audio and Visuals segment increased 15.7 per cent to Rs 6,300.20 crore in FY 2023-24 against Rs 5,445.73 crore a year ago. Its overall profit rose 22.18 per cent to Rs 167 crore, while revenue from operations surged 20.6 per cent to Rs 7,663.74 crore.
Nayyar said the over 20 per cent growth in the topline is because of the strategy of premiumisation on which it has been working for the last few years in all product zones, including TV and audio products.
""This is the primary cause because of the sales growth because our average sales price has gone up,"" he said, adding that ""now, we do not rely on selling entry-level or price point models"".
Now, in India, everything is being upgraded in the market from content on OTT platforms to everything in the market, he said.
""This is our ongoing journey for selling premium products in the country. So, this strategy, you can say philosophy, is working well for Sony. We have upgraded, and evolved the customer into the premium segments, especially in our television lineup, home theatres and cameras,"" said Nayyar.
Sony India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Japan's tech major Sony Corporation, expects to surpass its historic Rs 11,000 crore revenue, which it recorded in FY15, in the coming years.
Its revenue fell after its parent firm exited the mobile phone and laptop business. From FY22, however, Sony India's revenue stabilised and started to report positive growth numbers.
""I cannot peg a time framework, but efforts will be that we should soon become kind of Rs 10,000 crore company in a time to come,"" he said.
However, Nayyar also added that the market is a little bit challenging now, and there have been ups and downs.
""We are closely monitoring the situation, but our strategy remains the same, premiumisation and selling more premium products in the country, raising the ASP, giving new technology to our customers every year in all the segments, which we play,"" he added.
On Sony India's ongoing business in the current fiscal, Nayyar said all the categories are showing very positive momentum, especially television, sound bars, and home theatres.

JioCinema business head Ferzad Palia to step down,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/jiocinema-business-head-ferzad-palia-to-step-down/articleshow/115080398.cms,08-11-2024,"Ferzad Palia
, Business Head of
JioCinema
, is set to step down from his role, according to sources familiar with the matter. Palia will remain with the organisation during the transition period, particularly as merger-related activities progress, to ensure a smooth handover.
Viacom18
, which is in the process of merging with
Star India
, declined to comment on the development.
Palia has been a key figure at Viacom18 for nearly two decades, leading several consumer-facing businesses across digital and media platforms. At JioCinema, he managed both the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) and
ad-supported streaming
services.
Since its SVOD launch in April 2024, JioCinema has amassed nearly 20 million paid subscribers in just six months. In the ad-supported segment, Palia played a key role in JioCinema's expansion, helping to attract over 250 million monthly active users, making it one of India’s most popular streaming platforms.
Palia was instrumental in the launch of Voot Select, Viacom18’s premium streaming service, which has since been integrated into JioCinema. He also played a significant role in Viacom18’s entry into live sports, securing broadcast rights for major events like the FIFA World Cup.
Live Events
Earlier in his career at Viacom18, Palia led a strategic overhaul of the company’s youth-focused brands, particularly MTV, aligning its content with evolving audience preferences. He also managed the English entertainment segment at Viacom18, overseeing the growth of channels such as Comedy Central and Colors Infinity.

With Coldplay’s India tour….: BookMyShow reacts to black marketing of tickets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/with-coldplays-india-tour-bookmyshow-reacts-to-black-marketing-of-tickets/articleshow/115077943.cms,08-11-2024,"With Coldplay’s India tour, Maroon 5’s upcoming India performance, Lollapalooza India and many such acts in the pipeline,
BookMyShow
remains committed to bringing the biggest global events to Indians, said the company in a statement.
BookMyShow also said, “In addition to the FIR (First Information Report) filed by BookMyShow on the black marketing and scalping of tickets for recent high-demand live entertainment experiences, we have also provided all requisite information and details to law enforcement agencies in their investigations and will continue to proactively fight against scalping and
black marketing of tickets
– practices that are condemned and punishable by law in India.”
This comes after Maharashtra police's cyber wing has issued a notice to online ticketing website BookMyShow, asking it to implement strict measures including sale of name-based tickets for the concerts of British band 'Coldplay' in January and other shows. The notice was issued by the Maharashtra Cyber to prevent exploitation of fans who buy tickets from online platforms, an official said on Wednesday.
There are increasing number of complaints across online forums and social media about problems faced in booking tickets of such high-profile concerts and events through online platforms, he said.
Many people reported unresponsive websites during critical booking period, he said, adding that it leads to black-marketing of tickets at exorbitant prices, sometimes as high as 10 times the original price.
Live Events
The Maharashtra Cyber found that measures taken by the platforms to avoid such situations are insufficient, said the official.
A PIL has also been filed in the Bombay High Court seeking guidelines to curb black marketing and ticket scalping at major events, in the backdrop of alleged foul play during the online tickets sale for Coldplay's highly anticipated concert in Navi Mumbai in January 2025.
The PIL said there are several irregularities and illegalities during the sale of tickets for major events, such as concerts, live shows and so on.
Such irregularity and illegality was witnessed in September when tickets for the
Coldplay concert
were made available on the BookMyShow platform, it said.

Jitarth Jai Bharadwaj, the Managing Editor of The Australia Today said in a statement that the publication would continue to advocate for an open media.
""We at The Australia Today would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to every news outlet, journalist, and supporter who stood by us during a challenging time.

Premier League looking for media partners in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/premier-league-looking-for-media-partners-in-india/articleshow/115063385.cms,08-11-2024,"Mumbai: The
Premier League
, England's top club football competition, is scouting for media
rights
partners for the Indian market, as its existing three-year deal with Star India is set to conclude with the 2024-25 season and the broadcaster has not shown any inclination to renew the contract, three people aware of the matter said.
Star India, which owns and operates the
Star Sports
network and Disney+ Hotstar streaming platform, has been the Premier League's partner in the country for over two decades.
Due to the non-renewal of the deal, the Premier League has reached out to other players in the market, including Sony Pictures Networks India, Warner Bros Discovery's Eurosport and Dream Sports-owned FanCode, asking them to submit their price offers, one of the people said, requesting anonymity.
Star India had previously secured the rights through renewals, according to a sports
business
expert. While the Premier League has initiated the process to sell media rights, sources indicated that both Star and Sony are currently focused on securing the Asian Cricket Council media rights.
Star, Viacom18, Sony and the Premier League declined to comment. Reliance Industries' Viacom18 and Walt Disney-owned Star India are in the process of merging their operations.
Live Events
""The Premier League is in the market to sell the media rights as it seems that the renewal with Star didn't work out. They have also reached out to multiple players and are open to selling different kinds of packages, even if someone doesn't want all the matches,"" said a sports broadcasting executive.
A sports media rights expert said the value of Premier League media rights has steadily declined over the years, from a record $145 million (2013-14 to 2015-16) to $100 million (2016-17 to 2018-19), $81 million (2019-20 to 2021-22), and now $60 million (2022-23 to 2024-25), due to low TV viewership, monetisation challenges and a lack of interest from rival broadcasters.
""The Premier League is indeed one of the most coveted sporting events with a large fanbase in India, which is being further boosted by the continued rise of digital platforms like Disney+ Hotstar and Jio Cinema. However, monetising the content rights fee remains a challenge with many such high-ticket properties,"" said Rajesh Sethi, senior advisor for media and entertainment at PwC and former CEO of Ten Sports.
""It's a great sporting property to expand your viewership base but at the right price point,"" he said.
The Star-Viacom18 merger is in the final stages of completion. The merged entity, Star India, will hold all the Star and Viacom18 assets and will be controlled by Reliance, with Disney holding a significant minority stake.
The merged entity already has a dominant presence in sports, with cricket properties like the Indian Premier League, International Cricket Council, Board of Control for Cricket in India, Cricket Australia and Cricket South Africa.

Why community-building is key to creator success today,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/why-community-building-is-key-to-creator-success-today/articleshow/114891846.cms,03-11-2024,"Vanika Sangtani’s worries about staying relevant as a creator have eased with Instagram’s broadcast channels. “Being a creator on
Instagram
is exhausting,” says the spoken word artist from Mumbai, who has half a million followers on the social media app.
“Skip posting a Reel for three days, and you are forgotten. Channels have reduced my fear of losing followers,” she adds. Sangtani, 24, runs three channels catering to women with 5,000-15,000 members, each focused on different topics: motivation, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) support and finding love.
In February 2023, Instagram introduced broadcast channels to let creators send audio-visual content and textual updates as messages to followers who choose to join those channels. Instead of battling the algorithm or getting lost in the feed simply due to the surfeit of content, channels make sure a creator’s core audience sees their posts directly in their messages tab.
“These channels foster deeper connections with a smaller but loyal audience and let creators tackle niche topics without losing broader appeal,” says Sangtani, who also runs a travel company. “When I talked about PCOS on my main account, I would lose followers who couldn’t relate. However, on the PCOS channel, members and I have unfiltered interactions.”

SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL
Creators have always focused on spreading their content far and wide. Now they are realising small is beautiful, and perhaps more beneficial, too. “Communities help you become a character in your audience’s life,” says Sangtani. “Also, platforms are extremely unreliable, but the
community
you build will follow you anywhere. That’s why it’s crucial to create these smaller circles now.”
Is community at the heart of the new creator economy then? “It was always going to be,” says Shaikh Fardeen, co-admin of the meme page, Andheriwestsh*tposting. “You post a video, people start commenting. Soon, a group chat begins within comments section. That’s enough to tell you community is the gradual progression of all things creator economy,” he adds.
Lot of celebs launch products in their community channels to avoid a rival’s fan army from trolling in mentions or mass-reporting their posts, says Fardeen, citing examples of international celebrities like Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber. “It’s a safe space to target audience in these volatile times.”
Andheriwestsh*tposting has 156,000 followers while its broadcast channel has 6,500-odd people. Its three admins claim to talk to 300-400 people weekly about everyday things.
They try to give a glimpse into the personalities of the admins, often letting the members in on inside jokes they crack among themselves. “It’s a highly active channel and yet no member has left. For brand deals, we use the strength of the channel as one of the negotiating factors, claiming that the first 100 buyers are likely to come from this super-loyal and engaged cohort,” says Fardeen.
Online communities have been around since the days of Reddit, followed by Facebook groups, Discord for gamers, YouTube’s paid members hips, and
Telegram
and WhatsApp channels.
According to YouTube, in December 2023, YouTube channels in India earned 45% more revenue from channel memberships, year on year. Fardeen says Instagram understands the growing importance of community, which is why it is rolling out features to improve the channel experience. “For example, they have introduced post replies that create separate threads, making conversations easier to follow rather than getting lost in inbox clutter.”
Unlike previous iterations of community features, Instagram’s broadcast channels offer a more streamlined way for creators to provide exclusive content or updates, which feels more intimate and boosts loyalty, says Anushree Jain, cofounder of SocialTAG, an influencer-marketing firm. “They allow creators to build anticipation around product launches or brand collaborations. The exclusivity of the content in broadcast channels also enables deeper connections, translating into higher engagement and more opportunities,” she adds.
Instagram did not reply to emailed questions from ET. Slowly, brands are taking note, too. Animesh Mishra always checks a creator’s broadcast channel activity before partnering with them for his sneaker brand, Gully Labs. “It shows how engaged their core followers are, and I also look at the content they share to see how they use the platform,” he says. He points to an artist and fashion designer who opened up about his insecurities with balding on his broadcast channel, revealing a personal side. “It resonated with his audience and made them connect with the person behind the brand.”
Mishra believes that just as online brands eventually expand into physical stores, some of the biggest creators are hosting offline events and meeting their audiences to strengthen their community. “This will be the second growth trajectory for them,” he adds.
With everyone now creating broadcast channels, and notifications landing directly in your DMs, Instagram needs to be more selective about eligibility to create channels to avoid clutter and spam, says Mishra. Beauty creator Aanam C, who has over 333,000 Instagram followers, prefers WhatsApp's broadcast channels to Instag ram’s.
“Everyone uses WhatsApp more, and people rarely mute it, unlike Instagram where many don’t even have notifications on,” she explains. As a creator with over 13 years of experience across platforms, Aanam says she has always focused on building community, from Facebook groups to YouTube's community section. “I’ve never liked the idea of being a digital celebrity who has to be ‘followed’. I prefer the ‘friendship with the audience’ approach, rather than a ‘let me show you how to live’ style,” she adds.
Recently, Aanam shared a video of moving out of her house on her WhatsApp channel before posting it on her Instagram feed. “It’s nice seeing comments like ‘coming here from WhatsApp broadcast community’. It makes me feel closer to them in a way.”
Moving forward, she thinks she might post more often on the channel since it is quick and spontaneous, unlike the main feed, which requires editing and production. Although Sangtani from Mumbai hasn’t been able to regularly update her broadcast channels in recent weeks, her superfans are still intact—a testament to the power of the community she predicted. Her travel company sold out a premium Delhi-Himachal tour in less than 24 hours, promoted exclusively to the 500-member broadcast channel of her travel page @PinkExperiences.
“There’s more supply of content than demand on these platforms now,” she says. “Soon, people will cut down on screen time and stick to only a few creators they really care about. That’s when community will be your lifeline,” she says.

European Commission clears Reliance-Disney merger deal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/european-commission-clears-reliance-disney-merger-deal/articleshow/114830323.cms,01-11-2024,"Mumbai: The
European Commission
has approved the creation of a joint venture,
Star India
, by
Reliance Industries Ltd
(RIL), The Walt Disney Co. (TWDC), and BTS Investment 1, the latter owned by
James Murdoch
and Uday Shankar. The commission concluded that the transaction would not raise competition concerns, given the joint venture's negligible activities within the European Economic Area and the limited combined market share of the involved companies.
The merger between RIL's
Viacom18
and Disney's Star India is expected to conclude in early November, following approvals from the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
A senior official had earlier told ET that some international clearances were awaited.
This merger will create India’s largest and most powerful media and entertainment conglomerate, valued at $8.5 billion. As part of the deal, Viacom18 will transfer its assets to Star India, which will be the operational entity after the merger. RIL will hold a controlling 56% stake, while Walt Disney will have 37%, and Shankar and Murdoch’s
Bodhi Tree Systems
will hold 7%.
Nita Ambani
will be chairperson and Shankar will be vice chairperson.

"Sound, School and Studio: How Indie artist Rohan Solomon is building a musician's dream space",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sound-school-and-studio-how-indie-artist-rohan-solomon-is-building-a-musicians-dream-space/articleshow/114731982.cms,29-10-2024,"Rohan Solomon, the Founder of the Synergy Group, in the Falcon room at the studio
Delhi-based musician and producer Rohan Solomon has, over the span of 20 years, steadily expanded his expertise to not just being a singer and songwriter in front of a mic, but an artist and entrepreneur who now runs a comprehensive music hub,
Synergy Audio Productions
.
Where he was previously aiding independent artists as a producer to shape rough demos into sprawling, radio-friendly pop songs, Solomon now has a full music company that expands his vision, giving artists a world-class platform to nurture their talent and explore their creative potential.
A Music Mix Session in the flagship Falcon room, in full Dolby Atmos
Inspired by his own experiences as a musician, Solomon thought of the company as a space where artists could feel comfortable and inspired, among other things. ""As a musician, I remember feeling 'at home' and comfortable at certain studios back in my days,"" Solomon explains. ""I wanted to create a space like that on a larger scale.""
Originally started in New York City where Solomon had a stint as a producer and sound engineer behind the console,
Synergy Audio Productions
has grown into a go-to studio and learning center in Gurugram, Delhi NCR over the last year. Some of India’s top artists and eager new music students alike have gathered at the space, and along with it came acclaim.
Solomon was recently named
Creative Entrepreneur of the Year 2024
at the
ET Young Industry Leaders Awards
for leading Synergy Group into a whole new space that looks beyond being just a recording studio. After all, it’s the culmination of the artist’s life savings and years of working towards a dream that he wanted to get just right.
That said, Solomon did enlist the help of Munro Acoustics, a renowned U.K.-based company that has worked on iconic studios like Abbey Road. Together, they helped get the acoustics of Solomon’s brainchild just right.
The vintage Neumann M149 Microphone is the centerpiece of the Synergy Microphone collection
At a time when the music industry in India is booming and basking in a post-pandemic glow, we’ve seen big strides in the ecosystem – more record labels, more studios, more music education, and of course, tons of new artists. The infrastructure that Solomon is offering adds to that a great deal, while also looking into the demand for music education through an audio institute and its courses, plus another music institute for instrument-focused classes.
Solomon believes that artist-backed studios offer a unique advantage over any other recording studios in India. ""Most home studio owners work with consumer-grade interfaces/sound cards,"" he notes. ""This is enough to make recordings at home, but it usually lacks the flavor or audio that great analog equipment brings to the table.” He adds, ""We aim to go the extra mile. We have a great acoustic treatment and a commercial-grade studio.”
The team having a creative discussion
Earning his chops as part of feted rock band Cyanide and assisting on a Grammy-winning record by American hip-hop artist Anderson Paak (as an audio engineer), Solomon’s approach to producing music is centered on understanding the artist's vision and serving the story of the song. “There will always be a little spillover of your own artistic style into your productions,” he admitted. “But for the most part, I try to get in the artist's shoes and try to understand their story.”
At the end of the day, Solomon says he doesn’t necessarily want to stamp another artist’s song with his own production style, but simply follow any stylistic choices that will, again, serve the story of the song.
Like any artist embarking on a project of this scale that’s rarely been attempted before, Solomon’s journey to making this hub a reality wasn't without its challenges. The construction process, involving various teams and materials, proved to be time-consuming and demanding. From sourcing analog equipment to filling the void in India when it comes to analog preamps, EQs, and compressors to “dial in our sounds while recording,” Solomon says it’s all been worth it.

Part of the highlights for him is to see it all come to life in a studio setting with musicians and engineers in the room. Another humble brag Solomon can make is hiring sound engineers for internships, giving them access to rarely-seen recording gear, and seeing them grow in terms of mixing, mastering, and more. It’s tied into the work at
Synergy Audio Institute
, whereas the Synergy Institute of Music is more about shaping the fundamentals of all kinds of instrumentalists and vocalists.
As someone who went the do-it-yourself way with songwriting and production at the start with Cyanide’s music and later received guidance and mentorship in New York recording studios, Solomon understands the importance of a guiding hand. He along with a few seasoned industry professionals share insights and expertise to help artists refine their sound and develop their creative goals in an ever-changing ecosystem.

In arguably setting a new standard for the recording industry in the country, Solomon hopes that it can inspire others as well to maintain that level of high-quality access to studios. At the end of it, he still wants the space to feel like home, an idea that he clearly holds dear. He says, “I wanted to go the extra mile and create a home, where we can oversee a musician’s journey right from teaching them the basics, to providing a world-class recording studio, a store where we can sell them musical instruments at affordable rates, and also allow them to learn music production and audio engineering if their interest leads towards that,” concludes, the Grammy acknowledged
(We Demand Change 2021)
artist & Producer, who stands firm in his resolve to elevate music production and education standards in India.

Disney Star likely to lose Mihir Rale post Reliance merger,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-disney-star-merger-disney-star-likely-loses-mihir-rale-a-key-man-behind-ipl-rights-deal-and-launching-disney-hotstar-in-india/articleshow/114721254.cms,29-10-2024,"Disney Star has likely lost another key official as their legal head.
Mihir Rale
is stepping down at a time when the $8.5 billion merger between Reliance and Disney's Indian media assets are set to be concluded soon, sources aware of the development told ET Online.
Mihir Rale, now Chief Regional Counsel at Disney Star, joined Star India as a manager in 2009 and became the head of operations in India in 2019. At Star India, he helped create the Media Pro joint venture and acquired the ESPN stake in the ESPN Star Sports joint venture. He also established joint ventures for the company's football and Kabaddi programs. Mihir played a major role in acquiring important sports rights, including IPL, BCCI, and ICC, and was involved in launching Disney+ Hotstar in India.
Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance had in February this year signed a binding agreement with Disney to merge the media operations in India, the world's most populous country with diverse demography that consumes high volume of media content.
The merger between Reliance Industries Limited's (RIL) Viacom18 and Walt Disney's Star India is expected to be finalised in early November after receiving regulatory approvals in India, ET had reported citing sources familiar with the situation. This merger will form the largest media and entertainment conglomerate in India, valued at $8.5 billion. As part of the deal, Viacom18 will transfer its assets to Star India, which will operate as the main company following the merger.
Last week, reports said citing sources the head of Disney's Hotstar streaming app in India, Sajith Sivanandan, had resigned. K Madhavan, who served as the Country Manager and President of Disney Star, had also reportedly stepped down.

The resignations also come days after it was reportedly decided that all live sports events for the merged company, including the popular Indian Premier League (IPL), will be streamed on Disney's Hotstar app instead of Reliance's JioCinema.
ET had also reported citing sources that Reliance will keep Disney+ Hotstar as the only streaming platform after the merger of Star India and Viacom18.
Who is Mihir Rale? Key roles he played at Disney Star
Mihir Rale has played a key role in several important developments within the media industry. He was involved in the sale of Star's stake in the home shopping venture Star CJ and also facilitated the sale of Star's stake in Star News, a news and current affairs joint venture with ABP. He helped acquire an indirect stake in Tata Sky under Press Notes 2/3 of 2009 and oversaw the completion of the buyout of the entire promoter stake in Asianet. Additionally, he played a significant role in the acquisition of Maa TV.
Mihir was also instrumental in obtaining antitrust clearances and managing investigations related to various acquisitions and divestitures. He led litigation regarding the mandatory sharing of sports signals with Prasar Bharati, which helped reduce revenue losses for sports broadcasters in a challenging market. Furthermore, he challenged several TRAI regulations through collaborative efforts with the industry and the company to protect the freedom of speech and expression.
As a thought leader in the industry, Mihir addressed numerous issues, including over-the-top (OTT) content, broadcasting, theatrical distribution, satellite spectrum, and ensuring a fair share of OTT revenue for infrastructure providers. He also advocated for accessibility standards and raised awareness about warnings related to tobacco and alcohol in the media.
Mihir started his career as a litigation lawyer at Haresh Jagtiani & Associates, working at the Bombay High Court. Before joining Star India, he was with AZB & Partners, where he handled both legal disputes and other legal work.
He has an LLB and a Bachelor's degree in Socio-legal Sciences, both from the Indian Law Society's Law College at the University of Pune.

Bankruptcy court rejects plea to implement Zee-Sony merger,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/bankruptcy-court-rejects-plea-to-implement-zee-sony-merger/articleshow/114663906.cms,28-10-2024,"Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the
bankruptcy court
recently disposed of an application filed by
Phantom Studios India
(PSIPL), which sought to implement a
merger scheme
between
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEEL) and
Sony Group
companies Bangla Entertainment Private (BEPL) and Culver Max Entertainment (CMEPL).
The
National Company Law Tribunal
bench ruled that the application from a minor shareholder, seeking to enforce the scheme, is moot. It said that the shareholder's right to enforce the scheme lapsed after the companies' boards approved the scheme's withdrawal, despite his minor shareholding.
PSIPL, formerly known as Mad Man Film Ventures, owned about 1.3 million shares of Zee Entertainment, valued at around ₹50 crore, at the time of the tribunal filing.
Last month, the tribunal officially withdrew its approval for the proposed $10 billion merger between ZEEL and Sony's Indian media entities, CMEPL and BEPL.
""During the course of the hearing, we were informed that the PSIPL has attended the meeting of shareholders and voted in favour of the scheme. As Section V para 10 permits the withdrawal by parties, the PSIPL cannot insist on the implementation of the scheme,"" said the division bench of judicial member Lakshmi Gurung and technical member Charanjeet Singh Gulati in its October 24 order.
Live Events
PSIPL, represented by counsel Shyam Kapadia, argued that once shareholders approve a scheme, its essential terms cannot be changed without their consent. However, Sony's entities, represented by senior counsel Darius Khambata and Meghna Rajadhyaksha of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, countered saying that PSIPL lacked the standing to file the application, being a third party to the scheme. In this case, Nitesh Jain of Trilegal appeared for the Zee Entertainment Enterprises.
The companies also contended that the tribunal did not have the authority to enforce a scheme that had not taken effect and that the scheme was approved with conditions.
Ruchi Khatlawala Pandya, a partner at law firm Little & Co, said
shareholder rights
are crucial, especially when a merger scheme includes a withdrawal clause. ""The tribunal's order sets a precedent for cases where parties may reconsider implementation even after approval,"" she said.
In August, ZEEL and Sony's Indian units agreed to a
non-cash settlement
to resolve all disputes over their failed merger. The companies agreed to withdraw claims in the ongoing arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre and all related proceedings in the NCLT.
The settlement, aimed at independently pursuing future growth, followed Sony's January termination of the merger, citing ZEEL's unmet closing conditions and leadership disagreements. Sony then filed a $90 million
arbitration claim
against ZEEL.

Twitter India's FY24 net tanks 90% amid falling ad revenue,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/twitter-indias-fy24-net-tanks-90-amid-falling-ad-revenue/articleshow/114517332.cms,23-10-2024,"Mumbai:
Twitter Communications India
, now part of
X Corp
(formerly Twitter), recorded a sharp drop in
net profit
and revenue in the last financial year, largely due to a collapse in ad revenues after the dismissal of the company's global ad sales team under the new management led by
Elon Musk
.
As per the company's regulatory filings, net profit plunged 90% to ₹3 crore from ₹30 crore the previous year. Revenue also fell 90% to ₹21 crore from ₹208 crore.
Advertising contributes bulk of Twitter's revenue in India where it has an estimated 25 million users.
The company trimmed employee benefit expenses by 95% to ₹6 crore from ₹130 crore as it fired nearly the entire Indian workforce, which previously comprised over 200 employees. Subsequently, total expenses fell by 89% to ₹19 crore from ₹168 crore.
Twitter India
didn't respond to ET's queries.
Live Events
Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, eventually rebranding it as X. Following the takeover, Musk implemented sweeping changes globally, including
mass layoffs
that heavily impacted the ad sales teams, especially in India.
The dual blow of laying off the ad sales teams and global brands pulling back from the platform-due in part to disputes with Musk-fuelled a sharp decline in revenue.
Sajal Gupta
, a
digital advertising
expert, noted that without an active sales team to maintain relationships with advertisers and attract new business, Twitter's
ad revenue
in India nosedived, leading to steep declines in profitability and earnings. ""This reflects the broader challenges X Corp has faced globally as it tries to implement new strategies under Musk's leadership while managing the fallout from internal restructuring,"" Gupta said.
Under Musk, X has even filed lawsuits against global advertisers like Unilever and Mars for boycotting the platform. According to Kantar research, a net 26% of marketers reported plans to reduce ad spends on X in 2025, the biggest recorded pullback from any major global ad platform.
Gupta explained that many global brands stopped advertising in India due to the ongoing tensions with Musk, and even within India, many brands are avoiding advertising on X due to the controversial nature of the platform and concerns over brand safety.
""In terms of advertising on social media platforms, X is typically a last priority for advertisers, with YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram taking precedence,"" he said.

Reliance-Disney media giant may be born in November,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-disney-media-giant-may-be-born-in-november/articleshow/114477261.cms,23-10-2024,"The merger between
Reliance Industries Limited
's (RIL)
Viacom18
and Walt Disney's
Star India
is set to be officially concluded in early November after securing regulatory approvals in India, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The merger will create India's biggest and the most powerful media and entertainment conglomerate valued at $8.5 billion. As part of the merger deal, Viacom18 will transfer its assets to Star India, which will be the operating company post the merger.
The proposed company will encompass over 100 TV channels and two streaming platforms. The merged entity will retain one streaming platform, Disney+ Hotstar, which is also expected to stream the
Indian Premier League
(IPL) 2025.
""Most of the formalities for the merger have been finalised, and the combined entity under Star India is set to take effect on November 7,"" said a source, who requested anonymity, adding that the date might shift slightly.
In a recent regulatory filing, RIL said that the Viacom18 and Star India merger is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this financial year, pending additional approvals.
Live Events
Another source said that nothing is sacrosanct right now as some international clearances in the European Union are still awaited.
""There are some markets where we (Star and Viacom18) and Walt Disney have a presence. We are awaiting those clearances.”
RIL declined to comment till press time.
The merger, announced on February 28, has been completed in a record eight months, securing approvals from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), and the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB). The CCI granted conditional approval and its detailed verdict is expected soon.
While the process of putting together the leadership is still a work in progress, Kevin Vaz and Kiran Mani are slated to serve as co-CEOs, overseeing a workforce of roughly 8,000 employees.
However, the merger may lead to some headcount rationalisation due to redundancies, said sources.
Vaz is expected to lead the entertainment division, while Mani will oversee the sports division. Both are currently co-CEOs of Viacom18, managing its TV entertainment and digital operations. Sources add that K Madhavan, the country manager of Disney Star, is set to exit after the merger.
Some of the key executives tipped to join Vaz and Mani's teams in the merged entity include Alok Jain, Mahesh Shetty, Piyush Goyal, Ishan Chatterjee, Sushant Sreeram, Hursh Shrivastava, Sanjog Gupta, and Ajit Andhare.
Apart from Gupta, who currently heads sports for Disney Star, most of these executives are part of Viacom18 and
JioCinema
. Chatterjee and Sreeram recently joined as chief business officer and chief marketing officer, respectively, of JioCinema.
Nita Ambani and Uday Shankar will serve as chair and vice-chair of the merged entity.

The parties have given an undertaking that they will not increase the advertisement rates to an unreasonable level on their TV and streaming platforms for the ICC and IPL events till the current rights are held by them.
The merger was approved in August,
three months after they filed for it, paving the way for the creation of the country’s largest media and entertainment firm.
CCI had then said that the approval is subject to compliance with voluntary modifications to the merger scheme.
RIL will control the merged entity, with a 56% stake. Disney will own 37% of the combined firm, while Bodhi Tree Systems will have the remaining 7% stake.
The merged entity will have a valuation of Rs 70,352 crore and a dominant presence in both TV and streaming.
Star India has been valued at Rs 26,000 crore while Viacom18's valuation is Rs 33,000 crore. Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema have been valued more than the linear TV businesses of Star and Viacom18, respectively.
RIL will infuse Rs 11,500 crore in the merged entity. With this, Ambani's group will have ploughed more than Rs 22,000 crore into the media and entertainment business. In April 2023, RIL injected Rs 10,839 crore into Viacom18 as part of a Rs 15,145-crore infusion, which also saw Uday Shankar and James Murdoch's Bodhi Tree Systems invest Rs 4,306 crore.
The merger will also mark the exit of Paramount Global, which has sold its 13% in Viacom18 to RIL for Rs 4,286 crore.
Nita Ambani and Uday Shankar will be the chairperson and vice chairperson, respectively, of the merged entity.

Zee files settlement application with Sebi over alleged lapses,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-files-settlement-application-with-sebi-over-alleged-lapses/articleshow/114359474.cms,19-10-2024,"Mumbai:
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
has filed a settlement application with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (
Sebi
) to resolve the markets regulator's ongoing investigations into alleged
corporate governance lapses
and financial irregularities involving the media and entertainment company's promoters.
The application, submitted on Thursday without admitting or denying the allegations, is part of a process under Sebi's settlement regulations, which allow companies to reach an agreement with the regulator. This involves paying a fine or taking corrective actions in exchange for closing the probe.
""It has been observed that Sebi believes that the disclosure of financial information and the business transaction in ZEEL have been dealt in a manner which may be detrimental to the investors or the securities market during the investigation period,"" the company said in its settlement application.
""In order to bring closure to apprehensions raised in interim order, summons and various communications and to repose the faith of the investors (constituting ~96% public investors) in the company, it has been decided by the board to file the present settlement application for cordial resolution,"" it said. Sebi's probe into Zee began after concerns were raised over corporate governance issues, financial mismanagement, and potential securities law violations.
The probe has largely focused on Zee's promoter family, including its managing director and CEO
Punit Goenka
and chairman emeritus
Subhash Chandra
, who are accused of diverting company funds and engaging in undisclosed related-party transactions.
Live Events
In 2023, Sebi issued interim and confirmatory orders that barred the father-son duo from holding key positions in any listed company, including
Zee Entertainment
Enterprises.
Punit obtained relief from the securities appellate tribunal (SAT), allowing him to continue as MD and CEO of the company. Chandra has also challenged the Sebi order before the SAT.
A Zee spokesperson referred to the company's recent press release, stating that the board had advised proactively settling any pending adjudication proceedings with Sebi in a timely manner, prioritising the interests of shareholders and stakeholders. This advice came after the company's independent investigation committee submitted its report on allegations of irregularities against the promoters, which found no wrongdoing.

PVR Inox Q2 Results: Co posts Rs 12 crore loss vs Rs 166 crore profit YoY, revenue drops 19%
Stree 2, Kalki box office collections a big boon
Despite the financial loss, the Indian box office saw some gains, driven primarily by Hindi-language films and re-releases of popular titles. PVR Inox reported a 40% jump in box office collections in Q2 FY25 compared to Q1, reflecting a significant uptick in audience turnout. A major contributor to this success was the record-breaking performance of Stree 2, which became the highest-grossing Hindi film of all time. Additionally, Kalki, which was released at the end of Q1, continued to perform well across Hindi and Telugu markets, further boosting revenue.
Hindi-language films alone saw a remarkable 91% growth in collections quarter-on-quarter, with audiences flocking to theatres. On the international front, the much-anticipated Deadpool and Wolverine became the highest-grossing R-rated movie globally, bringing in $1.3 billion in worldwide revenue. Regional hits like Tamil’s G.O.A.T. and Telugu’s Devara also contributed to the quarter’s strong box office performance.

Re-releases add nostalgia to the mix
PVR Inox’s decision to re-release classics like Tumbbad, Laila Majnu, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein, and Veer Zaara during quieter periods proved highly successful. Re-releases accounted for about 6% of the quarter’s admissions, underlining that strong content—whether new or nostalgic—remains a major draw for moviegoers.
The company also saw a massive turnout on National Cinema Day, held on September 20. Over 1 million guests visited PVR Inox theatres, marking one of the busiest days of the year. This event, held in collaboration with 11 multiplex chains across India, showcased the love Indians have for the big screen experience.
Singham & Pushpa to the rescue now?
The upcoming quarter looks promising for PVR Inox, with a slew of highly anticipated releases set to hit screens. Recent releases include Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video and Jigra, while Diwali promises blockbuster films like
Singham Again
, starring Ajay Devgan and Kareena Kapoor, and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 with Kartik Aryan.
December will see Varun Dhawan and Jackie Shroff in Baby John, but the most anticipated release is Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2, scheduled for a multi-language release in the first week of December. Regional films such as Kanguva and Game Changer, as well as Hollywood’s Venom: The Last Dance and Gladiator 2, will ensure a diverse offering for cinema lovers.
In terms of operations, PVR Inox added 71 new screens in FY25 while closing 42 underperforming ones, resulting in a net addition of 29 screens. The company now operates 1,747 screens across 356 cinemas in 111 cities in India and Sri Lanka.
Looking ahead, PVR Inox remains committed to its strategy of generating free cash flow, improving returns, and reducing debt. The company reduced its net debt by ₹1,409 million in the first half of FY25, despite the challenges posed by a relatively soft first quarter.
Commenting on the results, Ajay Bijli, Managing Director of PVR Inox Ltd., stated that the performance in the quarter underscored the enduring appeal of cinema and the influence of compelling content. He noted that the company's strategy of blending fresh blockbusters with nostalgic re-releases had resonated well with audiences, further solidifying their position as a leader in the multiplex industry.

Network18's Q2 net loss widens by 28% to Rs 152 crore amid continued investments,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/network18s-q2-net-loss-widens-by-28-to-rs-152-crore-amid-continued-investments/articleshow/114177868.cms,13-10-2024,"Network18
Media & Investments has reported a 28% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its consolidated net loss for the quarter ending 30th September, with losses rising to Rs 152 crore. This increase is attributed to sustained investments in the digital and sports businesses by its entertainment subsidiary,
Viacom18
.
The company’s operating revenue for the quarter declined by 2.1% to Rs 1,825 crore, while expenses rose by 1.67% to Rs 2,243 crore. Viacom18 plans to continue investing in digital and sports content to drive future growth.
Viacom18 saw its revenue fall by 5.4% to Rs 1,339 crore, mainly due to fewer major film releases compared to the previous year. However, the news segment, which includes both television and digital platforms, experienced a 6% revenue increase to Rs 445 crore, driven by robust digital advertising, though television advertising remained weak.
In Q2 FY24, Viacom18 Studios released two big-budget films, but no films were released in this quarter, resulting in a Rs 330 crore impact on revenue. Nevertheless, this decline was offset by a 44% rise in subscription revenue, which grew to Rs 733 crore, aided by new pricing strategies and the increased monetisation of its sports portfolio.
Growth in
advertising revenue
was primarily led by digital, across both sports and non-sports sectors.

shareholders and stakeholders
. This action followed
Securities and Exchange Board of India

Sebi had also barred ZEE promoters from holding key positions in any listed companies. However, ZEE CEO
Punit Goenka

Subhash Chandra

Sony India net falls 19% in fy24; ad revenue takes a big hit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-india-net-falls-19-in-fy24-ad-revenue-takes-a-big-hit/articleshow/113993127.cms,07-10-2024,"Culver Max Entertainment, operating as

"Media companies to log 8% revenue growth, reaching Rs 60,000 crore by FY27: Crisil",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/media-companies-to-log-8-revenue-growth-reaching-rs-60000-crore-by-fy27-crisil/articleshow/113903597.cms,03-10-2024,"Media companies
are projected to achieve an 8%
revenue growth
, reaching Rs 60,000 crore by FY27, driven by the increasing contribution from the
digital segment
, according to an analysis by
Crisil
. This study examined 20 companies that account for 55% of the media industry’s revenue.
This growth follows a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% over the past five fiscal years, bringing total revenue to Rs 47,000 crore in FY24. The combination of revenue growth and a focus on cost rationalisation is expected to expand
operating margins
by 500 basis points (bps), reaching 18% by FY27.
The media companies included in the analysis span various segments such as broadcasting, print, out-of-home (OOH) advertising, radio, television, and digital platforms. The digital segment covers text, audio, video, interactive media, and images across websites, apps, and social media platforms.
According to Crisil, the shift toward digital consumption resulted in slower annual growth of 5% between FY19 and FY24. This shift was driven by factors such as increased smartphone usage, rising internet penetration, low data costs in India (about $0.2 per 1 GB), and the rollout of 5G technology. Media companies, however, were slow to adapt, but this is expected to change.
Manish Gupta, Senior Director at CRISIL Ratings, explained: “To better capitalise on the digital trend, media companies have started focusing on digital platforms like over-the-top (OTT) services, social media, and mobile apps. As a result, the digital segment will increase its share of media revenue, rising from 12% in FY24 (up from 8% in FY19) to over 18% by FY27, as consumers increasingly turn to digital media for news and entertainment.”
Live Events
Driven by growth in the digital segment, overall revenue for these companies is expected to grow by 8% annually between FY25 and FY27. This growth will also be supported by rising ad revenue in traditional sectors like print, driven by growing demand in industries such as fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), automobiles, education, online shopping, and real estate.
However, the digital segment has faced challenges in profitability, primarily due to high initial costs for manpower, content creation, and marketing. Furthermore, intense competition has kept margins tight, with consumers having numerous free alternatives for content.
Ankit Hakhu, Director at CRISIL Ratings, noted: “The operating performance of the digital segment is expected to improve. Media companies are now identifying the most appropriate customer segments for their offerings, allowing for more targeted promotional expenses. In Crisil's study, 8 out of 20 companies have already made significant progress in this area.”
The expansion of the digital segment has also allowed advertisers to deliver ads tailored to consumer interests and shopping behavior. With better understanding of consumer preferences, targeted advertising campaigns using analytics can enhance ad revenue per promotional dollar spent.
This, combined with increasing scale, is expected to help companies absorb fixed costs better, with the digital segment projected to break even in operating profitability by FY27 (improving from a 20% operating loss in FY24).
Overall, with the digital segment reaching profitability and traditional revenue sources continuing to grow, media companies are expected to see a 500 bps improvement in operating margins, reaching around 18% by FY27.
That said, overall profitability will still depend on factors like the cost of raw materials, particularly newsprint, which accounts for 30-40% of total costs. Geopolitical or supply chain disruptions could cause unexpected price fluctuations, as seen in FY23 when newsprint prices averaged $840 per tonne, up 23% year-on-year.

While Gen Z's digital savviness is widely recognised, Publicis Groupe identified a gap in understanding their specific relationships with key categories critical to marketers. This new study, employing a multi-dimensional methodology that includes in-depth interviews, focus groups, influencer discussions, and quantitative surveys, aims to bridge that gap.
The research, based on responses from over 3,000 Gen Z individuals aged 18-26 across different regions of India, offers insights into their values, motivations, and preferences in categories such as media, finance, fashion, health, food, and beverages.
Publicis Groupe’s study identifies six core traits that define India’s Generation Z, highlighting their unique behaviors across various product and service categories.
According to the report, Gen Z is driven by a desire to collect meaningful, memorable experiences, positioning them as experience seekers. They are also purpose-driven explorers, seeking authenticity and purpose in their endeavors.

Influencers and charismatic personalities play a pivotal role in shaping their preferences, further illustrating the importance of key figures in their decision-making process.
The research also emphasises that holistic well-being is central to Gen Z's lifestyle, with both mental and physical health taking priority. Moreover, technology seamlessly integrates into their daily lives, acting as an extension of their senses and influencing how they interact with the world.
Several trends emerged across different categories, showcasing Gen Z's distinct preferences. In media, authenticity is crucial—Gen Z is selective and avoids indiscriminate content consumption. In finance, they prefer quick returns and prioritize spending on experiences over long-term savings.
Health is a major focus, with mental well-being, stress reduction, quality sleep, and strong relationships taking precedence. Gen Z’s fashion choices are guided by sustainability, inclusivity, and self-expression, while their food preferences reflect a health-conscious mindset, favoring snacks with natural ingredients and minimal processing. In beverages, their choices align with values of health, sustainability, and tradition.
This report provides valuable insights for brands and businesses aiming to engage effectively with this influential generation. Understanding Gen Z's distinct behaviors and values will enable marketers to tailor their strategies to better meet the needs of this diverse group.
All insights from this research will be integrated into Publicis Groupe India’s proprietary tools, including the growth OS, iTitan, and their AI-powered insight generator, BUZ AI.

Vinciquerra joined SPE in June 2017 and led the company's dramatic turnaround, achieving five consecutive years of increasing profit by strengthening SPE's film slate, reimagining its television businesses, and pursuing aggressive M&A in key growth areas, such as the acquisition of Crunchyroll in 2021. His strategic decisions, including the divestment of most of SPE's international cable networks and the decision not to enter the overcrowded general entertainment streaming space, have kept SPE profitable during a time of unprecedented industry change.
In recent years,
Vinciquerra
led SPE through some of the entertainment industry's most challenging events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the historic SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes of 2023, which brought television and
film production
to a standstill. Despite these challenges, SPE remains strong and competitive among its peers.
""When I stepped into this role seven and a half years ago, I never imagined the extraordinary industry disruption and opportunities we'd face,"" said Vinciquerra. ""I'm filled with immense gratitude for this exceptional company and its profound legacy in Hollywood history. I'm consistently inspired by my brilliant and resolute colleagues. Together, against the odds, we've achieved remarkable success and proven that this is a community built on passion and resilience. Thank you for making these past seven and a half years the most gratifying of my career. My sincere appreciation goes to Kazuo Hirai for offering me this opportunity in 2017, and to Kenichiro Yoshida and Hiroki Totoki for their leadership and unwavering trust and support over the years. I have the utmost confidence that SPE will continue to thrive and know that Ravi is the right leader to take SPE forward.""

On August 30, the NCLT approved the scheme of merger of Viacom18 Media and Digital 18 Media, holding media and entertainment assets of Reliance Industries, with Star India.
The scheme had proposed the transfer and vesting of Media Operations Undertaking from Viacom 18 and Jio Cinema into Digital18, which is a subsidiary of Viacom 18. This would be followed by ""demerger, transfer and vesting of V18 Undertaking from Digital 18 into Star India"".
The merger of the media assets of Reliance Industries and The
Walt Disney
Co. will create the country's largest
media empire
worth over Rs 70,000 crore.
Earlier, the CCI had said it had cleared the ""proposed combination involving Reliance Industries Ltd, Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd, Digital18 Media Ltd, Star India Pvt Ltd and Star Television Productions Ltd, subject to the compliance of voluntary modifications"".
Viacom18 is part of the RIL group, and SIPL is wholly owned by The Walt Disney Company. STPL, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, is owned indirectly by Walt Disney.
The CCI, however, did not disclose voluntary modifications in the original deal made by the two parties.
Under the deal, the Mukesh Ambani-led RIL and its affiliates will hold 63.16 per cent of the combined entity that will house two streaming services and 120 television channels.
Walt Disney will hold the remaining 36.84 per cent stake in the combined entity, which will also be India's largest media house.
Reliance Industries has also agreed to invest close to Rs 11,500 crore into the
joint venture
to give it the muscle to fight rivals like Netflix and Japan's Sony.
Nita Ambani
, wife of RIL Chairman
Mukesh Ambani
, will head the joint venture, while Uday Shankar will be its vice-chairperson.

"India on cusp of entertainment revolution driven by tech, diverse content: Kevin Vaz",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/india-on-cusp-of-entertainment-revolution-driven-by-tech-diverse-content-kevin-vaz/articleshow/113677961.cms,26-09-2024,"India is on the cusp of an
entertainment revolution
, driven by technology, diverse content, and evolving consumer behavior, said Kevin Vaz, CEO of Broadcast Entertainment at
Viacom18
, during his address at APOS 2024.
Vaz pointed out that India's daily media consumption—across large (TV) and small screens (mobile)—lags behind that of developed markets, but the growth potential is immense. Currently, large-screen penetration in India stands at around 60%, compared to 85-90% in other major markets, leaving considerable room for expansion.
He emphasised that India is an 'AND' market, where both TV and
digital platforms
are thriving simultaneously, offering vast opportunities for content creators and distributors.
According to Vaz, Viacom18 has made significant strides over the past year, having built a top-class team and made strategic investments in key brands like
Colors
and Nickelodeon. These efforts have paid off, with Colors achieving a 35% growth rate and Nickelodeon maintaining its leadership in the kids' segment, he added.
Vaz also highlighted the success of Viacom18's regional TV channels, Colors Kannada and Colors Marathi, underscoring the growing importance of regional language content in India's entertainment landscape.
Live Events
Viacom18 currently provides content in 10 languages, with plans to expand to all 22 official languages. ""India’s cultural and linguistic diversity is unparalleled—22 official languages and over 58 socio-cultural regions. This diversity presents both a challenge and an opportunity,"" he added.
He also touched on the evolution of
media consumption
habits in the country, where audiences are increasingly fluid in switching between TV, digital platforms, and social media.
""A show like Bigg Boss is watched on Colors at its scheduled time, then consumed further on
JioCinema
’s 24-hour live feed, and even discussed on social media. This
multi-screen experience
is where the future of entertainment lies,"" Vaz said.
On the advertising front, Vaz highlighted Viacom18's ability to deliver value across both TV and digital platforms. He noted that TV as a medium reaches 900 million viewers in India, while Viacom18's digital platform, JioCinema, engages 300 million users. This dual-platform approach enables advertisers to target multiple demographics effectively.
""With over 95% of households having just one TV, families gather to watch together, creating shared experiences and deeper emotional connections.
TV advertising
remains one of the most effective ways to reach multiple demographics—parents, kids, grandparents—all engaged in a single viewing experience,"" he explained.
""On the digital side, Viacom18 is home to the largest curated content platform in India, with a monthly active user base of around 300 million,"" Vaz added.

"Rs 3.4 lakh for a Coldplay concert ticket? Frustrated fans say 'people are buying to make money, not to attend'",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/rs-3-4-lakh-for-a-coldplay-concert-ticket-frustrated-fans-say-people-are-buying-to-make-money-not-to-attend/articleshow/113588244.cms,23-09-2024,"The ticketing frenzy for
Coldplay
’s upcoming Mumbai concerts saw unprecedented demand from Indian fans, with over 1.3 crore people logging in to secure one of the 1.5 lakh available tickets. Fans flooded
BookMyShow
’s website and app when ticket sales began at noon on Sunday, but within just 30 minutes, all tickets for the British rock band's shows at
DY Patil Stadium
in January sold out.
The concerts, set for January 18, 19, and a third show added later on January 21, each have a venue capacity of 50,000. Despite BookMyShow’s efforts to manage the overwhelming traffic, many fans were left disappointed and empty-handed as tickets disappeared almost immediately.
Fans left shocked as Coldplay tickets for Mumbai concert vanish
Fans were prepared well before noon, eagerly refreshing their screens to get a chance at attending Coldplay’s second visit to India. As told to TOI, Pune-based musician Imaad Saraf shared his frustration, saying, ""My whole family was trying to buy the tickets at the dot of noon, but the notification read ‘there are not enough tickets in the inventory’ on the portal.” His experience was echoed by thousands of fans, many of whom complained that they never stood a real chance at securing tickets.
Adding to the frustration was the news that reseller sites had begun offering tickets at massively inflated prices. BookMyShow priced tickets between ₹2,000 and ₹35,000, but soon after, resale platforms like
Viagogo
were listing them for as much as ₹10 lakh. A ₹12,500 ticket was being sold for over ₹3.36 lakh on these platforms, with standing tickets, originally priced at ₹6,450, being resold for up to ₹50,000.
Surge in Resale Prices Angers Fans
Fans were quick to voice their outrage over the black market for Coldplay tickets. Another fan, Joshua Fernandes, an IT professional from Bengaluru also told TOI, “Standing-on-the-ground tickets, originally priced at ₹6,500, are being sold at over ₹50,000 in black.” He added, “The band has a mandate for
ticket prices
to allow people a fair chance of buying them. But in India, these plans don’t work.” He however was one of the lucky ones, because he managed to secure his tickets.

Social media platforms were flooded with similar complaints. One fan tweeted, “Anyone trying to resell their Coldplay tickets for Mumbai shows at obviously inflated prices should have their tickets canceled. BookMyShow and Coldplay, please take strict action.” Another user wrote, “The issue of our country is 50% of people are booking the ticket to make money and not attend the show. I can see already black selling has started on X… it’s disgusting.”
The rapid escalation in ticket prices left many fans feeling cheated, with some suggesting alternative ticketing methods. One fan posted on X, recommending an IPO-style allocation system where seekers would open
UPI
mandates and tickets would be allocated based on an algorithm to ensure fair distribution. “The queue system gives an awful user experience,” they added.

BookMyShow’s Response and the Addition of a Third Show
BookMyShow addressed the overwhelming demand and technical issues caused by the high traffic on their platform, which briefly crashed due to suspicious and malicious activity. A spokesperson from BookMyShow explained, “We implemented a queueing system to manage the overwhelming demand and addressed issues caused by suspicious and malicious traffic within minutes, causing a brief delay, but ensuring minimal disruption for genuine fans.”
To accommodate the unprecedented demand, BookMyShow added a third show on January 21, but even this additional show sold out in a flash. Despite the increased availability, fans continued to struggle with securing tickets while dealing with skyrocketing resale prices.

Black Market and Social Media Giveaways
As tickets continued to vanish from official channels, the resale market thrived. Viagogo, a popular reseller platform, listed Level 1 tickets for ₹1.05 lakh each, more than 234 times their original price of ₹4,500. Lounge tickets, which initially sold for ₹35,000, were listed at prices reaching ₹10 lakh.
In addition to formal reseller platforms, many individuals took to social media to sell ‘extra’ tickets they had purchased, often at exorbitant prices. Others capitalized on the situation by hosting ticket giveaways and contests. Many of these posts claimed that users had secured four tickets but only needed two, offering the remaining tickets for free to those who liked and shared the post.
“Some top tier engagement farming going on with the whole ‘I got 4 Coldplay tickets, but need only 2. So like and RT’ racket,” one user commented on the gimmick, mocking the widespread trend of engagement baiting.

Frustration Mounts Amid Resale Crisis
The ticketing chaos has drawn comparisons to similar experiences during Taylor Swift’s concerts, where fans also faced a battle to secure tickets due to high demand and rampant black market sales. Coldplay’s fanbase in India has proven to be just as enthusiastic, with many willing to pay inflated prices for the chance to attend. However, the ongoing issues with ticket allocation and resale practices have left a sour taste for those who missed out on tickets.
Looking ahead, fans are calling for stricter regulation of the ticketing process to prevent resellers from exploiting such events. As one fan put it, “This is about the sheer joy of being there physically. You don’t just listen; you experience.”

"As big-budget films continue to bomb, Bollywood stops shooting for stars; more and more movies shelved",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/big-budget-movies-continue-to-bomb-more-films-shelved-as-bollywood-stops-shooting-for-stars/articleshow/113558069.cms,22-09-2024,"Mumbai: The Hindi
film industry
has seen 30-40
big-budget films
getting shelved in the past year and a half, a sharp rise from the pre-pandemic average of 10-15 annually, according to trade analysts, causing fresh concerns in
Bollywood
despite some recent relief brought by the success of a few mid-size releases.
Big-budget films like Rakshas and Baiju Bawra (Ranveer Singh); Ganpat 2, Rambo and Hero No.1(Tiger Shroff);Hera Pheri 3 (Akshay Kumar); Draupadi (Deepika Padukone) and Mr Lele (Varun Dhawan) are among the projects featuring prominent stars that have been shelved, industry watchers said. Such films account for 30-40% of all projects announced during the period when the Hindi movie industry has seen several releases that have failed to make an impact at the
box office
. Producers and trade analysts told ET that three key factors have made launching a Hindi film increasingly unviable: high costs linked to star remuneration and their entourages, promotion, marketing and advertising; a lack of confidence in the commercial viability of existing scripts that don’t align with shifting audience tastes and the failure of stars to deliver strong box-office openings.
Content is King
“Today, stars cannot guarantee you a good opening at the box office. The industry must accept this,” said Tanuj Garg, managing partner at Ellipsis Entertainment, a production house. “Actors and directors before the pandemic worked on hefty fees. This was impractical and unsustainable.” This is a wake-up call and the Hindi film industry is thinking about what is viable and what is not, he said.
“It is quite clear that high concept films are working at the box office and not big stars. So, a film’s content has to work,” said Garg of Ellipsis Entertainment. After the pandemic,
streaming platforms
increased their investments in buying films and creating original content. They invested in actors who did not belong to the A-list category, paying them close to three times the fees they previously charged, said trade analysts.

This became a benchmark in the industry. But these actors could not provide a reasonably good opening to their films at the box office. After the list of films failing to make a mark got long and their focus turned to profitability, streaming platforms reduced their average spending on acquiring a film. According to the Ficci-EY Media and Entertainment industry 2024 report, the number of films released directly on these platforms reduced to 57 in 2023 from 105 in 2022. This impacted the revenue of producers. The total revenues from selling digital rights of films fell to Rs 3,500 crore in 2023 from the peak of Rs 4,000 crore in 2021, shows data from the Ficci-EY report.
“Today, more than 50% of the cost of a film goes into remuneration of stars,” film distributor and trade analyst Shaaminder Malik said. “Take, for instance, the recent Hindi film Khel Khel Mein. The budget of the film is Rs 150 crore. The film is shot almost completely indoors,” he said. “Why does such a film require such a high budget? It is clear that a large part of the film’s budget has gone into remuneration of stars and their entourage. Despite this, the film has collected less than Rs 40 crore at the box office.”
According to industry insiders, the financial dynamics within the Hindi film industry have reached a point where scriptwriters earn less than what is spent on a star’s entourage. After covering these substantial costs, producers are hesitant to allocate further funds for
film promotion
and advertising, leading to a lack of audience awareness about new releases and their launch dates, which can severely impact a film’s success.
On an average the cost of promotion, marketing and advertising associated with a mid-sized or big-budget film is estimated in the range of Rs 8-15 crore. Malik said: “The stupendous success of Stree 2 lies not only in its franchise value but also in its tight budget and strong and sustained marketing and promotion.” Girish Johar, a producer and industry expert said: “A sense of pragmatism has prevailed among makers today. The whole focus has shifted to relooking at both costs and streams of revenue thoroughly.""

Star claims $940 million damages from ZEE over failed deal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/star-claims-940-million-damages-from-zee-over-failed-deal/articleshow/113467338.cms,19-09-2024,"Walt Disney-owned
Star India
has sought damages of $940 million from
Zee Entertainment
Enterprises for its failure to honour the $1.5 billion International Cricket Council (ICC) TV rights deal, as per a regulatory filing by Zee.
In the filing, Zee refuted the claims made by Star, which quantified the damages in its statement of case before the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) Arbitral Tribunal on September 16.
Zee said that the arbitration is in its initial stage and that the LCIA Arbitral Tribunal has yet to determine if the company is liable in any manner.
“The company will, on merits, strongly contest all unfounded claims by Star and reserves all its rights,” it said in the filing.
Star is in the process of merging with
Reliance Industries
Limited (RIL)-owned Viacom18 to create India’s largest media and entertainment company worth $8.5 billion.
Live Events
The proposed merged entity, which will be controlled by RIL, is likely to pursue the matter before the LCIA once the merger becomes effective. The National Company Law Tribunal and the Competition Commission of India have approved the merger deal.
Liabilities relating to the ICC TV deal were among the key reasons for the drop in Star's valuation to $3 billion. Despite being the bigger of the two entities, Star was valued lower than Viacom18, which had a valuation of $4 billion. RIL will infuse $1.5 billion in the merged entity.
The damages worth $940 million include costs, expenses and applicable interest until full payment, as on August 31, the proxy date of the award. Star had initiated arbitration proceedings against Zee before the LCIA on March 14.
Star terminated its alliance agreement with Zee on June 20 while asserting that it would pursue the matter through arbitration proceedings before the LCIA.
The Disney-owned company acquired the ICC TV and digital rights for $3 billion from 2024–27 and had sub-licensed the TV rights to Zee under an alliance agreement on August 26, 2022.
The Punit Goenka-led company had earlier communicated to Star that the alliance agreement could not be proceeded with since it was subject to certain conditions, including submission of financial commitments, provision of bank guarantee and corporate guarantee, and pending final ICC approval for the sub-licensing deal.
It has also sought a refund of Rs 69 crore that it had already paid to Star. The company has accrued Rs 72.14 crore towards bank guarantee commission and interest expenses for its share of bank guarantee and deposit.
Zee didn’t go ahead with the alliance agreement due to the failure of its merger deal with Sony Group’s India entities. The company acquired the ICC TV rights with the understanding that the $1.5 billion growth capital that was to be infused by Sony Group would be used to fund sports rights acquisition.
Earlier, Star had sent letters to Zee through its legal counsel alleging breach of the alliance agreement on account of non-payment of dues for the rights in relation to the first instalment of the rights fee aggregating to $203.56 million.

"Star files Statement of Case in London court against ZEE, seeks $940 million in damages",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/star-files-statement-of-case-in-london-court-against-zee-seeks-940-million-in-damages/articleshow/113448464.cms,18-09-2024,"In what may account to be fresh trouble for
Zee Entertainment
Limited (ZEEL),
Star India Private Limited
(Star) has filed
Statement of Case
in its ongoing
arbitration proceedings
against the former, seeking
damages
of $940 million (approximately Rs 7, 869 crore) in the now terminated ICC TV rights deal case.
However, Zee has strongly denied all allegations and claims made by Star, asserting that the arbitration is still in its early stages. It categorically refuted Star's assertions, vowing to ""strongly contest all unfounded claims"" and stated that it will defend its position on merit. The company added that it ""reserves all rights"" in the ongoing arbitration.
This case pertains to Zee's non compliance in August 2022 deal with Star under which it would have sub-licenced the ICC TV rights until 2027. Zee had quit the $1.4 billion deal after missing its first $200 million payment, saying it was not in a position to pay.
Shares of
Zee Entertainment
were down 0.56%, trading at Rs 132.30 a piece on the BSE at 12:30 p.m.
The case was filed in March 2024
and in the lates development, Star has submitted its Statement of Case to the LCIA Arbitral Tribunal, requesting a formal declaration that the agreement was validly terminated and seeking damages to be assessed based on the Tribunal's final award.
Live Events
Star's damages, as of a proxy date of August 31, 2024, are estimated at $940 million, along with costs, expenses, and interest until full payment, Zee said.
Zee has said that the
LCIA Tribunal
has yet to determine whether Puneet Goenka-led company bears any liability in the matter.

ANI sues Netflix for using its content in hijack drama,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ani-sues-netflix-for-using-its-content-in-hijack-drama/articleshow/113203456.cms,09-09-2024,"Indian news agency
ANI has sued
Netflix
Inc and producers of an Indian series about a
plane hijack
, asking for four episodes to be taken down as they used ANI content without permission, ANI's lawyer told Reuters on Monday.
The series, called ""
IC-814
: The
Kandahar Hijack
"" - a fictionalised version of the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines flight 814 from Kathmandu - has been embroiled in controversy since its release last month.
Social media users
and members of
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
's
Bharatiya Janata Party
have criticised the show for what they said was an incorrect portrayal of the hijackers as Hindus with Hindu names when they were Muslims.
Netflix added new disclaimers to the six-episode show last week after its officials were summoned by India's information and broadcasting ministry. It also said the code names used in the series reflected those used during the actual event.
""They have used copyright archival footage of ANI without licence, they have also used the (ANI) trademark,"" Sidhant Kumar, counsel for ANI, said.
Live Events
""Since the series has come into such criticism, our trademark and brandname is being tarnished,"" Kumar said, adding that ANI wants Netflix to take down four episodes where its content has been used.
The Delhi High Court had agreed to hear the case and sought the response of Netflix, he said.
There was no immediate response from Netflix for a request for comment from Reuters, which has a minority stake in ANI.
India blames Pakistan and Pakistan-based militant groups for the December 1999 hijack, which was resolved after New Delhi freed three Islamist militants, including Masood Azhar, the head of one such group.

IPL franchise powers Sun TV's FY24 revenue growth amid challenges in TV business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-franchise-powers-sun-tvs-fy24-revenue-growth-amid-challenges-in-tv-business/articleshow/113073037.cms,05-09-2024,"Sun TV Network
's revenue for the fiscal year 2023-24 experienced a significant boost, largely driven by its Indian Premier League (
IPL
) franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and its SA20 franchise, Sunrisers Eastern Cape.
The company's revenue from
cricket franchises
surged by 138% to Rs 659 crore in FY24, up from Rs 276 crore in the previous year. The company's consolidated revenue from operations surged 15% to Rs 4,787 crore, while net profit jumped 13% to Rs 1,925 crore.
This increase was fuelled by a rise in revenue from the central revenue pool, which was supported by the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) record Rs 48,390 crore
media rights deal
with Disney Star and Viacom18 in 2022.
Sun TV's annual report for FY24 highlighted that revenue contributions from its cricket franchises will continue to grow, supported by additional revenue streams from movie distribution in the coming years.
Income from movie distribution and sale of rights increased 24% to Rs 313 crore from Rs 253 crore.

Despite the success in its sports segment, Sun TV's core
broadcasting business
faced challenges. Advertising revenue declined by 1.84% to Rs 1,493 crore, reflecting broader industry trends due to the shift of ad dollars to digital.
In contrast, subscription revenue grew by 5.4% to Rs 1,814 crore, with the company noting that subscription revenues have now overtaken ad revenues. However, the base for ad revenue remains strong due to increased viewership.
The reserve and surplus of the company as of March 31 stood at Rs 10,156 crore as against Rs 8,941 crore in the trailing fiscal.
During the year under review and as of the date of this report, the company has expanded its offerings by adding four new channels to its portfolio: Sun Marathi HD, Sun Bangla HD, Sun NEO, and Sun NEO HD. Sun NEO is a free-to-air Hindi general entertainment channel.
The company owns and operates 37 TV channels in seven languages: Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bangla, Marathi, and Hindi. It also owns a streaming platform, Sun NXT, besides FM radio stations Red FM and Suryan FM.

IPL valuation down by 11.7% on weak media rights score,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-valuation-down-by-11-7-on-weak-media-rights-score/articleshow/113039958.cms,04-09-2024,"Mumbai: The business enterprise value of the Indian Premier League (
IPL
) has been marked down by 11.7% to $9.9 billion in 2024 from $11.2 billion last year by valuation services provider
D and P Advisory
, following a reassessment of
media rights
value amid consolidation in the media industry.
In INR terms,
IPL valuation
has dropped 11% to ₹82,700 crore from ₹92,500 crore.
A lack of competitive bidding for the next IPL media rights cycle—in the light of the merger between
Star India
and
Viacom18
and the delay in entry of tech giants Amazon, Meta and Apple in the IPL media rights bidding arena—could result in a more conservative approach, said the report titled ‘Beyond 22 Yards’.
Apart from this, the failed merger between
Sony
and
Zee
has also contributed to the downward revision in IPL’s valuation, said Santosh N, managing partner of D and P Advisory.
The Sony-Zee merger could have created a strong competitor to the Star-Viacom18 combined entity in the IPL auction.
Live Events
Star India and Viacom18 purchased the IPL media rights for ₹48,390 crore from 2023-27, an increase from the ₹16,347 crore they paid for the 2018-22 cycle. Apart from Star and Viacom 18, Sony and Zee were the other bidders for the IPL media rights auction held in June 2022.
The merger between Reliance Industries-owned Viacom18 and Walt Disney-owned Star India is expected to create a monopoly in cricket broadcasting, with the com-bined entity having all the major cricket rights, including the IPL, the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Recently, BCCI secretary Jay Shah had sounded confident that new players will bid for the next cycle of the IPL media rights notwithstanding the Star-Viacom18 merger.
“My job is to ensure the growth of the game and increase the brand value of Indian cricket. As it happens, the broadcasters come automatically,” he had told ET. As per the D and P Advisory report, Mumbai Indians is the most valued IPL franchise in 2024, followed by Chennai Super Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bang-alore, Delhi Capitals, Gujarat Titans, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Lucknow SuperGiants, Rajasthan Royals, and Punjab Super Kings in that order.
The report has pegged the Women’s Premier League ecosystem’s business enterprise value at $160 million, up 7% from the inaugural edition's value of $150 million. The report provided just the ecosystem value WPL since it is in a nascent stage.
The media rights are the most valuable asset for all sporting leagues. The shift in consumer content consumption from TV to digital is disrupting the market.
The BCCI had earned a surplus of ₹5,120 crore from IPL 2023, an 116% increase over ₹2,367 crore that the cricket board earned from the IPL 2022 season.
According to the board’s annual report for 2022–23, total income from IPL zoomed 78% on year to ₹11,769 crore in 2023, while expenditure surged 66% to ₹ 6,648 crore.

Essel chief Subhash Chandra says he'll take Madhabi Puri Buch to court,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/essel-chief-subhash-chandra-says-hell-take-madhabi-puri-buch-to-court/articleshow/113003395.cms,03-09-2024,"MUMBAI:
Essel Group
chairman
Subhash Chandra
said he would take legal action against the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India,
Madhabi Puri Buch
, accusing her of derailing the Zee-Sony merger.
Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Monday, Chandra said that he would not cooperate with the Buch-led market regulator in its ongoing investigation in an alleged fund diversion case against
Zee Entertainment
promoters.
Chandra said he has furnished documents sought by
Sebi
. The Bombay High Court had in June asked him to submit the documents that the regulator had asked for in March.
He alleged that Sebi under Buch scuttled Zee's merger deal with Sony Pictures Networks India through its ""motivated investigation"" against him and his son Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive of Zee Entertainment. He noted that Sebi's confirmatory order banning Goenka from holding a top-level position in any listed entity was overturned by the Securities Appellate Tribunal.
A senior Sebi official called Chandra's claims ""misleading, malicious and opportunistic"". ""It is not uncommon for such entities to resort to such tactics and Sebi is committed to conducting investigation at the highest level of integrity,"" the official added.
Live Events
According to Chandra, minority shareholders of Zee were the biggest losers due to the failure of the Sony-Zee merger. ""Sebi professes to protect the interests of the minority shareholders, but it's them who lost the most because of the drop in Zee's share prices after the deal with Sony collapsed,"" he said.

"Merged Star India-Viacom18 to be cash rich by over Rs 19,000 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/merged-star-india-viacom18-to-be-cash-rich-by-over-rs-19k-cr/articleshow/113003304.cms,03-09-2024,"The newly merged entity of
Star India
and Viacom18 will boast a strong cash position exceeding Rs 19,000 crore, factoring in Viacom18's current
cash reserves
and investments of Rs 7,829 crore, and an infusion of Rs 11,500 crore from
Reliance Industries
Ltd (RIL), officials close to the development said.
Star is, however, unlikely to have any
cash reserves
currently, the people said.
The cash pile will empower Star-Viacom18 to make major investments in its digital and
sports businesses
, which are anticipated to be loss-making in the short term.
As per the agreement with Walt Disney, RIL will inject Rs 11,500 crore into Star-Viacom18, gaining a controlling 56% stake.
Walt Disney
will hold a 37% stake, with the remaining 7% owned by Uday Shankar and
James Murdoch
's Bodhi Tree Systems.
In the digital space, Star-Viacom18 is likely to face stiff competition from streaming giants like Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video, who have been heavily investing in India's streaming market since their entry in 2016.
Live Events
The merged enterprise, having secured all major regulatory approvals, will become the primary destination for key sporting events, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) matches, International Cricket Council (ICC) events, the English Premier League, the Women's Premier League (WPL), the Indian Super League (ISL), and the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL).
Viacom18's annual report for FY24 indicates that the company's cash and investments total Rs 7,829 crore, with Rs 4,726 crore in cash and cash equivalents, and Rs 3,103 crore in investments.
In 2023, Viacom18 got a Rs 15,145 crore cash infusion from RIL and Bodhi Tree, most of which has been allocated to its sports and
digital businesses
.
Over the past few years, Viacom18 has committed more than Rs 34,000 crore to acquiring key sports properties such as IPL digital rights, BCCI media rights, WPL, ISL, and the 2024 Olympic Games.
These substantial sports investments have triggered a net loss of Rs 252 crore for Viacom18 in FY24, compared to a net profit of Rs 11 crore in the previous fiscal. However, sports-related ad revenue has driven a 75% surge in overall revenue, reaching Rs 8,032 crore.
The merger has been approved by both the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), with CCI's approval contingent on voluntary modifications, including the divestment of certain TV channels and a freeze on ad rates for two years, say people aware of the development.
According to a Media Partners Asia report, the merger will create a media powerhouse with a profitable entertainment business but loss-making sports and streaming businesses.
The report predicts that the merged entity will generate $2.8 billion in revenue with an Ebitda loss of $200 million on a pro forma basis for FY24. It also highlights that the entertainment segment, consisting of Hindi and regional language channels, is likely to produce an estimated $600 million in Ebitda on $1.3 billion in revenue.
Meanwhile, the TV sports segment, including channels under the Star Sports and Sports18 brands, is expected to incur an operating loss of $600 million, despite generating $700 million in revenue.
In the streaming video segment, comprising Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema, revenues are forecast to reach $800 million, with a $150 million Ebitda loss. The merged entity is expected to retain JioCinema as its primary streaming platform, potentially absorbing Disney+ Hotstar.

SEBI
Chairperson
Madhabi Puri Buch
and said he will stop cooperating the capital markets regulator. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) did not offer any comment immediately. However, a source familiar with the matter told PTI that the allegations are malicious.
""All these allegations made by Mr Chandra are malicious. The facts would suggest otherwise,"" the source told PTI.
Chandra, now Chairman Emeritus of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL), said he is exploring legal action against Buch as he is convinced that the ""SEBI Chairperson is corrupt"" and has asked other corporate houses to join his fight.
While responding to a question, Chandra said his issue with the Sebi Chairperson also impacted the Zee-Sony merger.
""Yes, this was the main reason for the merger to set apart, and that is why I am questioning today that SEBI is supposed to protect the interest of minority shareholders, and she succeeded in pushing away Sony from getting merged with Zee,"" he alleged.

Congress' Pawan Khera slams SEBI Chief Madhabi Puri over alleged dual salary from Govt & ICICI Bank
On September 2, Congress leader Pawan Khera attacked Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch over irregularities and alleged that she was drawing salary from not just the government but also private banks ICICI Bank and ICICI Prudential. In a press conference, he further alleged that several probes on ICICI Bank were adjudicated while Buch was receiving such income. Khera urged the SEBI chief to come out and issue a clarification on the row. While taking a jibe at Buch, Congress spokesperson said that reports suggest the SEBI chief relaxed norms for ICICI Bank.He also attacked PM Modi and HM Amit Shah and said, 'The role of SEBI is to regulate the share market where we all invest our money. Who appoints the chairperson of SEBI? This is the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, Prime Minister and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. This committee has two members for appointing the chairperson of SEBI...'.
Chandra also claimed that he wrote to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman regarding the matter but has not received a response.
He also alleged that Buch is ""biased"" against him and he has taken a decision ""not to cooperate with SEBI any further"".
He also urged ZEEL to ""stop cooperating with SEBI any further; since it is a biased
investigation
being carried out; with a pre-conceived mindset of SEBI Chairperson.""
""
ICICI Bank
and my investigation tells me that Madhabi Puri Buch and Chanda Kochhar at that time, were constantly on phone calls,"" he said, adding: ""She was the very close person, and Chanda Kochhar was the one who was giving the money to her, which has been revealed today this morning, for crores of rupees, she was taking illegally from ICICI,"" Chandra told reporters.
This controversy arose after SEBI last year alleged siphoning of funds as the father-son duo used fixed deposits (FDs) of Rs 200 crore of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL) to repay loans of certain entities.
Chandra and his son Goenka were barred from holding the position of director or key management personnel in any listed firm until further orders by Sebi.
Both Chandra and Punit Goenka challenged the Sebi directive before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), which stayed the order.

RIL AGM 2024: 'Beginning of a new era' as Mukesh Ambani welcomes Disney post CCI approval,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ril-agm-2024-beginning-of-a-new-era-as-mukesh-ambani-welcomes-disney-post-cci-approval/videoshow/112895483.cms,29-08-2024,,media

Mukesh Ambani
on Thursday welcomed Disney after the company received CCI's approval for merger. During the 47th
AGM
, Ambani lauded the deal and called it ""beginning of a new era.""
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Wednesday approved the merger of media assets of
Reliance Industries
and The Walt Disney Co to create the country's largest media empire worth over Rs 70,000 crore. The deal, announced six months ago, faced scrutiny by the anti-trust regulator and the approval has come after the parties proposed certain modifications to the original transaction structure.
In a post on X, the regulator said it has cleared the ""proposed combination involving Reliance Industries Limited, Viacom18 Media Private Limited, Digital18 Media Limited, Star India Private Limited and Star Television Productions Limited, subject to the compliance of voluntary modifications"".
Viacom18 is part of the
RIL
group, and SIPL is wholly-owned by The Walt Disney Company. STPL, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, is owned indirectly by The Walt Disney.
The CCI, however, did not disclose voluntary modifications in the original deal made by the two parties.
Live Events
Under the deal, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and its affiliates will hold 63.16 per cent of the combined entity that will house two streaming services and 120 television channels.
The Walt Disney will hold the remaining 36.84 per cent stake in the combined entity, which will also be India's largest media house.
Reliance Industries has also agreed to invest close to Rs 11,500 crore into the joint venture to give it the muscle to fight rivals like Japan's Sony and Netflix.
Nita Ambani, wife of billionaire and RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani, will head the joint venture, while Uday Shankar will be the Vice Chairperson.
Shankar is a former top Disney executive.
The deal will also require approval of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

What were CCI's concerns over Disney-Reliance deal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/what-were-ccis-concerns-over-disney-reliance-deal/articleshow/112884765.cms,29-08-2024,"Walt Disney Co
and
Reliance Industries
won approval from the Competition Commission of India (
CCI
) on Wednesday for an $8.5 billion merger of their Indian media assets after offering concessions relating to their grip on
broadcasting rights
for cricket, India's favourite sport.
Here are the key points raised in the CCI's initial assessment, according to a confidential letter sent to the companies on Aug. 19 and reviewed by Reuters:
MARKET POSITION
Reliance's media and entertainment unit had a
market share
of 7.5% in 2023-24 in the sports TV channel segment, while Disney had a 77.7% share in those years.
Rival Sony had an 8.6% share in
sports TV channels
.
""The sports TV channel segment is already highly concentrated,"" the CCI said in the letter. ""Most of the current sports content such as cricket ... are streamed on either of the two platforms (of
Reliance
and Disney)"".
The CCI also noted ""there is a possibility of higher negotiating power and the ability to monetize the sports rights via subscription and advertising"".
BIDDING PATTERN
""The combined entity would have a larger financial capacity to acquire various sports rights,"" the CCI document said.
It analysed the bids submitted earlier for sports rights and found that Disney and Reliance are ""close competitors"".
Disney and Reliance told the CCI that big foreign players are likely to enter the Indian market to bid for streaming rights of key sports events, but the watchdog said there was no such intent expressed by companies publicly.
AD MARKET DOMINANCE
Disney and Reliance are competing for advertisers. ""After the merger, there may not be an adequate number of competitors ... for advertisers,"" the CCI said.
As there would be a lack of competitive prices, advertisers may not be able to negotiate with the Disney-Reliance merged entity, the CCI feared.

Reliance Industries and Walt Disney merger approved by Competition Commission of India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-industries-and-walt-disney-merger-approved-by-competition-commission-of-india/articleshow/112875499.cms,29-08-2024,"The
Competition Commission of India
(
CCI
) has approved the
merger
between Reliance Industries-promoted Viacom18 and Walt Disney-owned Star India three months after they filed for it, paving the way for the creation of the country’s largest
media and entertainment
firm.
The watchdog on Wednesday said the
approval
is subject to compliance with voluntary modifications to the merger scheme. A CCI order detailing these modifications will be released soon.
ET was the first to report on August 2 that the two conglomerates are confident of closing the merger deal by October.
The voluntary modifications may set the stage for ongoing oversight to ensure the new entity does not engage in monopolistic practices, particularly in sports broadcasting and content licensing, said Nilesh Tribhuvann, managing partner, White & Brief Advocates & Solicitors.
Live Events
With CCI approval in place and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) posting the merger scheme for final hearing, integration between the two companies will begin soon.
Elara Capital senior vice-president Karan Taurani said the competition regulator’s approval is the biggest hurdle to be crossed in such large deals. “With the CCI approval in place, others (from) NCLT, ministry of information & broadcasting, etc, will not be that time-consuming,” he said.
RIL
will control the merged entity, with a 56% stake. Disney will own 37% of the combined firm, while Bodhi Tree Systems will have the remaining 7% stake.
The merged entity will have a valuation of Rs 70,352 crore and a dominant presence in both TV and streaming.
Media Partners Asia vice-president Mihir Shah said the formidable entity will capitalise “on scale and synergies in TV and streaming, with ambitions to redefine the media market landscape and compete more effectively with global digital juggernauts.”
Star India has been valued at Rs 26,000 crore while Viacom18's valuation is Rs 33,000 crore. Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema have been valued more than the linear TV businesses of Star and Viacom18, respectively.
RIL will infuse Rs 11,500 crore in the merged entity. With this, Ambani's group will have ploughed more than Rs 22,000 crore into the media and entertainment business. In April 2023, RIL injected Rs 10,839 crore into Viacom18 as part of a Rs 15,145-crore infusion, which also saw Uday Shankar and James Murdoch's Bodhi Tree Systems invest Rs 4,306 crore.
“Under a new market framework, the industry must tackle past challenges, including the under-indexing of advertising spend relative to GDP and escalating content costs in streaming,” said Shah, adding that strategic investments in talent development and technological advancements will be crucial for future growth.
The merger will also mark the exit of Paramount Global, which has sold its 13% in Viacom18 to RIL for Rs 4,286 crore.
Nita Ambani and Uday Shankar will be the chairperson and vice chairperson, respectively, of the merged entity. Disney Star head K Madhavan is likely to exit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
As reported earlier by ET, Star and Viacom18 had offered to shut some second-rung entertainment channels across languages in markets where there is an overlap. ET reported that Disney+ Hotstar may get absorbed into JioCinema to create India's preeminent streaming platform. Another alternative proposed by Reliance and Disney was to freeze ad rates for two years, specifically on cricket rights.
Milestone merger
The merger approval is historic from an industry and consolidation standpoint, said TMT Law Practice founding partner Abhishek Malhotra. “From the lens of competition law, this demonstrates the approach of laissez faire, that is, to grant the merger approval and let the merged entity play out in the arena and demonstrate its commitment to upholding competition, by making voluntary concessions and commitments,” he said. “Of course, CCI remains vigilant to address any specific information/complaint of anti-competitive behaviour in future.”
“Overall, this merger represents a significant transformation in India's media landscape, creating opportunities and challenges for industry players, reshaping the competitive environment, and having far-reaching implications for content production, advertising, and consumer choice,” said Tribhuvann of White & Brief.
Sudip Mahapatra, partner at law firm S&R Associates, said, “These measures were voluntarily proposed by the parties, presumably to address the concerns raised by CCI. The parties can go ahead with the transaction by implementing these measures. Given that the parties themselves proposed these measures, they should be able to implement them without significant challenges.”
“Remedies and timelines offered by the parties to CCI would entail starting the procedural steps for the merger and putting in place a postclosing monitoring mechanism to ensure (continued) compliance…,” said Shafaq Uraizee Sapre, Mumbai managing partner of law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan.

Reliance's JioCinema and Disney's Hotstar would have a combined library of 200,000 plus hours of content that includes television dramas, movies and sport events.
Disney's Hotstar was the second-most downloaded video streaming app in India in 2022 after MX Player, according to a report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and EY.
Disney's streaming content includes global blockbusters, movies from the Marvel universe as well as National Geographic documentaries. It streamed seven out of the top 15 most-watched original shows in India in 2022, according to a report by media consulting firm Ormax.
JioCinema last year struck deals with The Pokemon Company to stream content and signed a deal with Warner Bros to bring more Hollywood and international content on its platform.

In June, the NCLT had allowed Zee to withdraw its application seeking implementation of the company's scheme of arrangement with Sony Group-owned Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment.
Zee
had moved NCLT after the Sony Group-owned entities terminated their merger deal with the Indian entertainment giant on January 22 over alleged unfulfilled closing conditions and the dispute over the leadership issue.
On January 22, Sony Group terminated its proposed merger deal with Zee over the latter's non-fulfilment of merger closing conditions. Sony had also approached the SIAC seeking $90 million in termination fees.
Four months after Sony Group's India entities terminated the deal, Zee had terminated the MCA with Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment in May and called upon both companies to pay a termination fee of $90 million.
Sony and Zee signed a merger agreement in December 2021 under which Sony would have held 50.86% of the new company, while other Zee shareholders would have owned a 45.15% stake. Zee founders would have held 3.99% of the combined entity. Sony had also pledged to infuse $1.5 billion in the merged entity.

NBDA
) will meet
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
on Tuesday to discuss important issues concerning the broadcasting sector, including the
draft Broadcast Bill
and the
IT Rules 2021
, sources privy to the development told ET.
The meeting will be attended by the top brass of the NBDA, including India TV chairman Rajat Sharma,
TV18 Broadcast
MD Rahul Joshi, TV Today Network vice chairperson Kalli Purie, and
NDTV
whole-time director Sanjay Pugalia, among others.

Zee Entertainment Sony Merger
Sources add that the NBDA has not circulated any specific agenda for the meeting. ""NBDA officials have been told to be on standby for the meeting,"" one of the sources added.
In February, the NBDA expressed strong reservations about the draft Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill 2023. The first draft of the bill was circulated in November 2023, while the second draft was provided to select stakeholders in July 2024.
Live Events
The ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) had recently asked the stakeholders to return the hard copies of the draft bill. The ministry also stated that it will hold wider consultations with stakeholders before issuing a fresh draft.
The
broadcast
bill has been met with stiff resistance from the media industry for bringing OTT and digital news under its ambit. The second draft went a step further and treated social media users beyond a certain threshold, which was to be notified later, as OTT broadcasting service operators or digital news broadcasters.
In its submissions to the MIB, NBDA stated that the broadcast bill gives excessive powers to government officials. It had also stated that some of the definitions and provisions are vague and ambiguous.
The NBDA had also raised concerns about the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, since it gave power to government agencies to take down content that it considers fake.
Another important issue that is expected to come up for discussion is that of the Department of Telecom's (DoT) plans to open the 3700-4200 MHz spectrum band for telecom operators for provisioning of 5G/6G services.
Last year, NBDA had written to the DoT stating that shifting the broadcasters from the current frequency band of 3700 to 4200 MHz to 4000 to 4200 MHz will sound the death knell for the broadcasting sector.
The NBDA had also stated that the reduction of bandwidth on the C-band spectrum will lead to a reduction of 60% capacity across all satellites, because of which more than 40 transponders would have to move to higher frequencies, which will create serious and irreversible disruptions in the broadcasting industry.
NBDA comprises 28 leading news and current affairs broadcasters who run 73 news and current affairs channels and 54 digital news platforms.

DPIIT's withdrawal of a copyright rule order to strengthen rights owners' position: Experts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/dpiits-withdrawal-of-a-copyright-rule-order-to-strengthen-rights-owners-position-experts/articleshow/112796852.cms,26-08-2024,"New Delhi: The
DPIIT
'S withdrawal of the September 2016 office memorandum regarding extending the scope of a copyright rule to
internet transmissions
would bolster the position of copyright owners and aid them in negotiating better
royalty rates
, according to experts. Last week, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal
Trade
(DPIIT) withdrew an office memorandum regarding extending the scope of Section 31D to internet transmissions.
In 2016, through an office memorandum, the government decided to include Internet broadcasting under the purview of the Copyright Act.
DPIIT has said that in light of the decision of the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay in the matter of
Tips Industries Ltd
vs
Wynk Music Ltd
, the office memorandum issued by the department on September 5, 2016, is ""hereby rescinded"".
This section talks about statutory licences for the broadcasting of literary and musical works and sound recordings.
Abhay JV, Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co said that the withdrawal of the office memorandum will be welcomed by the owners of copyright (record labels etc) since it will strengthen their position in negotiations with organisations desirous of streaming works on the internet.

""The major advantage to the owners of copyright will be that they will now be able to negotiate the royalty rates, without being anxious of such rates being decided by the commercial court,"" he said.
However, he added that the action of the DPIIT also underscores the need for India to have a balanced framework where both copyright owners and organisations desirous of using copyrighted works on the internet can benefit.
""This is especially required considering that India has a large internet subscriber base and OTT market and generates substantial revenue. The need for amendment of the existing legislation to keep pace with technological evolution and to deal with complex issues arising therefrom is also imminent,"" Abhay said.
Explaining the rule, he said Section 31D (inserted after the 2012 amendment) of the Copyright Act, 1957, provides that any broadcasting organisation desirous of communicating a work to the public by way of a broadcast or a performance can acquire a statutory license to do so, by giving prior notice and paying royalty to the owner of copyright at the rate fixed by the commercial court.
In other words, it created a statutory licensing regime whereby a broadcaster was allowed to communicate work after paying royalty to the owner of the copyright, he said.
""The right to broadcast works online through internet transmission is, however, missing from the ambit of Section 31D. Transmission through the internet may include online music streaming services or other related streaming services and OTT platforms,"" Abhay said.
This absence of transmission through the internet benefited copyright owners as they were able to exploit the ever-expanding online market through individual licensing agreements and without depending upon statutory licenses issued by the relevant authority.
On September 5, 2016, the DPIIT thought it apt to issue an office memorandum stating that Section 31D, which refers to 'any broadcasting organisation desirous of communicating to the public', may not be restrictively interpreted to cover radio and TV broadcasting, but appears to include internet broadcasting as well.
""While there were concerns expressed by the industry, especially the music industry, the memorandum was not rescinded. The notification has now been rescinded by the DPIIT on August 21, 2024, on account of the decision of the division bench of the Bombay High Court disposing of the appeal in Wynk Music Ltd. v. TIPS Industries Ltd. on the basis of a settlement between the parties,"" he explained.
Global Trade Research Initiative
(GTRI) Founder Ajay Srivastava said that the rescinding of the order marks a significant legal development in India's
digital content
and copyright landscape.
""It underscores the judiciary's role in interpreting statutory provisions and the importance of ensuring that digital platforms comply with the correct licensing frameworks,"" he said.
Srivastava added that the decision is expected to have a lasting impact on the digital music industry, influencing how music is licensed and distributed online while encouraging fair compensation for artists and rights holders.
""For copyright holders, the decision is a victory that strengthens the protection of their rights in the digital age. It emphasises the importance of securing proper licenses before distributing copyrighted content online, which could lead to more stringent compliance practices within the industry,"" he said.
On the other hand, digital music platforms have expressed concerns about the potential increase in licensing costs and the challenges of renegotiating agreements, he said adding the decision may also influence the availability of certain music on these platforms, as the cost of obtaining licenses could affect their business models.

"Paris Olympics 2024 attracted 17 crore viewers on JioCinema, Sports18",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/paris-olympics-2024-attracted-17-crore-viewers-on-jiocinema-sports18/articleshow/112733819.cms,24-08-2024,"Mumbai: The
Paris Olympics
2024 topped all previous editions of the multi-discipline sporting event in India, achieving record viewership and broadcaster revenue.
Viacom18
, the official media rights partner of the games, said more than 170 million viewers tuned in to the games on
JioCinema
and
Sports18
Network.
Further, the broadcaster said the games saw a 2.6 times surge in revenue over the 2020 edition, when it was broadcast on Sony Pictures Networks India's TV and streaming platforms.
According to market experts, Viacom18 garnered ad revenue of ?110 crore during the 17-day event compared to ?40 crore in the 2020 edition. The event was streamed for free in 4K video resolution across 20 concurrent feeds on JioCinema. Viacom18 paid roughly $31 million for the Paris
Olympics
compared to $10 million paid by Sony for the Tokyo Games.
Live Events
Navin Khemka, CEO, South Asia at EssenceMediacom, said the multidisciplinary nature of the Olympics helps it accumulate viewership. ""Some viewers are interested in sports where India is expected to do well, while some disciplines like tennis and football have a core fan base who will tune in irrespective of the fact whether or not India is participating,"" he noted. Khemka said the scale of monetisation on events like the Olympics is low since there is less ad inventory to sell compared to cricket, which is a marketer's delight due to the commercial opportunities it presents.
Kiran Mani, CEO, Viacom18 Digital said Paris 2024 is a prime example of how non-cricket sporting action is continuing to grow in adoption among Indian audiences. ""Both the viewership scale and the enthusiastic advertiser participation bear testimony to that,"" he said.
The Indian Olympics Association (IOA) also doubled its sponsorship revenue to ?50 crore for the Paris Olympics, according to Neerav Tomar, CEO at IOS Sports. IOS is the official marketing agency of the IOA. ""Apart from the sponsorship fee, brands also spent an estimated ?250 crore on activating the sponsorship deals,"" he added.
Athletes like Neeraj Chopra and Manu Bhaker, who won medals at the Olympics, are also being wooed by sponsors. JSW Sports COO Divyanshu Singh said Chopra's current endorsement value is ?4 crore annually, which is projected to grow by 40-50% going forward on the back of his consistent performance at international events. Chopra currently endorses 21 brands, including Visa, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Britannia, Gillette, and Krafton. ""We only do long-term deals for Neeraj Chopra with brands as it's a win-win for both sides. Long-term associations help brands to leverage their association with Neeraj to build meaningful relationships with consumers,"" Singh said. According to Tomar, there has been a heightened interest among brands to work with non-cricketers. IOS manages Manu Bhaker, who created history by winning two bronze medals, one alongside Sarabjot Singh.

Sony Pictures' channels back in Tata Play's DTH packages,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-pictures-channels-back-in-tata-plays-dth-packages/articleshow/112720219.cms,23-08-2024,"Broadcaster
Sony Pictures
Networks India's (
SPNI
)
channels
are back in direct-to-home (
DTH
) operator
Tata Play
's
packages
after the two sides amicably ironed out their differences.
On August 1, Tata Play had started removing SPNI channels from its package, citing the falling
market share
of the broadcaster's flagship Hindi general entertainment channel, Sony Entertainment Television (SET).
Prior to the dispute, SPNI's Hindi channel package was part of over 50% of Tata Play's
subscriber base
of 20 million.
""Everything is now in order, and SPNI channels are available and accessible in all Tata Play packs,"" an SPNI spokesperson said.
Broadcasters usually prefer to place their channels in all the packages of
distribution
platforms for a higher audience reach, which is important from an ad monetisation point of view.
Live Events
""As was planned, we adjusted the packs of certain customers with the provision that customers can add back channels at any time according to their preferences,"" said a Tata Play spokesperson.
Countering Tata Play's assertion, SPNI had claimed that the removal of channels from packages followed its request to conduct an
audit
of the DTH operator's subscriber management system (SMS). The broadcaster had claimed that it had encountered discrepancies in Tata Play's SMS.
The broadcaster was even considering legal options since the channels were removed despite the two companies having a valid content agreement in place.
The pay-TV industry in India is going through a challenging phase due to customer churn and a fall in average revenue per user (APRU). The pay-TV universe has 110 million homes equally split between cable and DTH.
Tata Play CEO Harit Nagpal had said that the DTH operator was well within its rights to remove channels from bouquets in order to reduce the burden on consumers. He had also contended that the removal of SPNI channels from packages will save Rs 50-60.
""As a service provider, I am duty-bound to take care of the interests of my broadcast partners by providing them reach and my customers by reducing burden on them,"" he had stated.

"Disney-Reliance offer concessions for $8.5 billion India merger, but no cricket rights sale",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-reliance-offer-concessions-for-8-5-billion-india-merger-but-no-cricket-rights-sale/articleshow/112713749.cms,22-08-2024,"Disney
and
Reliance
have offered some concessions to secure an India antitrust approval for their $8.5 billion media merger, but are unwilling to sell any
cricket broadcast rights
, the biggest prize in the deal, two sources familiar with matter said.
Reuters reported earlier this week that the
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) sent a warning notice to the companies expressing concern that their merged entity will have a tight grip on most cricket rights for TV and streaming in India, and can hurt advertisers.
In their response, the companies have offered to go easy on advertising rate hikes and not increase them unreasonably, the sources said.
Reliance-Disney are aiming to create India's biggest
entertainment player
which will compete with
Sony
, Netflix and Amazon with 120 TV channels and two streaming services, but cricket, which has a fanatical following in the country, is the crown jewel.
Many antitrust experts had said that one way to clear the antitrust hurdle was to sell some cricket rights, be it for some tournaments or broadcast medium like TV, but Disney and Reliance have made a new private submission at the CCI in which they have said they are unwilling to do so, said the two sources, who declined to be named as the process is confidential.
Live Events
The submissions are being reported for the first time. Reliance, Disney and the CCI did not immediately respond to Reuters queries.
The companies have told the CCI they were willing to commit they are not going to increase advertisement prices for cricket matches in any unreasonable way, said the sources.
The first source, however, added the companies have not committed to imposing any price caps or freeze on increasing ad rates for a particular period.
Antitrust experts foresee that to seal the deal the companies need to provide structural changes to their arrangement or so-called behavioural remedies, or both, which can include selling some broadcast rights and capping ad rates.
The companies believe cricket rights in the country crazy for the sport, and on which they've spent roughly $9.5 billion, are too lucrative to part with and are key to the deal, said the first source.
The CCI is likely to review the submissions and see if the new concessions are enough to assuage antitrust concerns, or a broader investigation is needed.
Over the years, both companies offered free viewing of matches to attract users to some of their streaming platforms in the hope they will buy subscriptions to watch more content.
Jefferies has said the Disney-Reliance entity will have a 40% share of the advertising market in TV and streaming segments.
The CCI earlier privately asked Reliance and Disney around 100 questions related to the merger. The companies have already told the watchdog they are willing to sell fewer than 10 television channels to assuage concerns about market power and win an early approval.

CCI tunes in to RIL-Disney merger show, raises query
The companies can simply sell rights of certain cricket tournaments or for a particular medium, such as TV or streaming, to meet antitrust concerns, they said.
Reliance and Disney have spent roughly $9.5 billion in recent years for TV and streaming rights for the world's richest cricket tournament, the Indian Premier League, the International Cricket Council's matches such as the one-day and T20 World Cups, and matches organised by the Indian cricket board.
Another solution the companies can offer is to commit that they will cap advertisement rates for cricket matches for a few years, so they can assure the watchdog that advertisers' interests can be protected, said the lawyers.
""What they can offer is that the rates will be fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, or that they will not increase the rate beyond a certain percentage which accounts only for inflation,"" said Rahul Rai, a partner at Indian law firm Axiom5.

""The worst case is if the CCI asks for sale of some of their rights.""
Disney, Reliance and the CCI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The companies have previously told the regulator the rights will not harm advertisers and will expire by 2027-28, when rivals can bid for them again.
No rights, no deal
Cricket rights are central to the
Disney-Reliance merger
.

Over the years, both companies offered free viewing of matches to attract users to some of their streaming platforms in the hope they will buy subscriptions to watch more content.
One lawyer said if there were no cricket rights, ""the deal is dead"".
Together, the merged Disney-Reliance entity will also own Indian broadcast rights for other sporting events including the Wimbledon tennis championship, MotoGP and the English Premier League.
Media agency GroupM estimates that companies spent nearly $2 billion in India in 2023 on sports industry related sponsorship, endorsement and media. Cricket accounted for 87% of that spending.
Reliance has already offered selling fewer than 10 TV channels - mostly in regional languages - to win the
CCI approval
but resisted changes to cricket rights, which irked the regulator, Reuters has reported.
Kanika Chaudhary Nayar, an antitrust partner at law firm DSK Legal, said Disney and Reliance could also possibly meet some of the concerns by selling sports TV channels that don't show cricket, and then try to retain their overall portfolio of the cricket broadcast rights.
""They can argue they are foregoing some overall sports revenue to retain cricket rights-related revenue,"" she said.
If the CCI is not satisfied with companies' latest offer, it can carry out a more in-depth review of the merger which can drag the approval process for months, lawyers say.
An industry source said despite the notice Disney remains confident of winning an approval without selling the rights.
K.K. Sharma, a former head of mergers at the CCI, said the deal, if approved, would create ""a big fish in the broadcasting market ... and a practical monopoly on cricket advertisement revenues"".
""The combined strength of the new entity would give it a clear dominant position,"" he said.

merger, said people familiar with the matter.
RIL and Disney, which are seeking to complete the merger by October, have been scouting for ways to assuage the regulator's concerns about the potential impact of the merger on the Indian media and entertainment (M&E) industry.
""The proposal being discussed internally is to provide a two-year price freeze on ad rate cards to all advertisers and agencies,"" one of the persons said.
A second person added that ""both sides are confident that the merger deal will cross the CCI hurdle."" ""Price freeze on ad rate cards has the potential to allay CCI's concerns of the merger's impact on competition,"" the person said.
Media agency officials believe RIL and Disney's proposal is interesting as it might help the Star-Viacom18 combine secure CCI approval, and that possible ad revenue loss due to the ad rate freeze will be low.

However, some officials argue that the merged entity will face negligible loss from the proposed rate freeze, especially for properties like the Indian Premier League (IPL), which have been badly impacted due to softness in advertising in the last two years.
""Both Star Sports and JioCinema wouldn't mind keeping the ad rates unchanged considering they have barely managed to fill the ad inventory due to the exit of new-age advertisers and wariness among traditional brands to make expensive buys on cricket,"" a media buyer said.
Both RIL and Disney declined to comment.
Apart from the rate freeze, other proposals being madec by RIL and Disney include shutting certain weaker channels in Hindi and regional markets as the combined entity's market share in many markets would easily cross the 40% threshold.
The CCI is probing Viacom18 and Star India's ₹70,000 crore merger proposal, citing potential antitrust issues and questioning their dominant market shares in TV and streaming segments.
It is examining whether the consolidation of key cricket rights with Star-Viacom18 will give an unassailable competitive advantage to the proposed merged entity.
Cricket is the most popular content genre in India, cutting across age, income, and language barriers. It commands the highest premium ad rates, unmatched by any other genre.
An industry expert said the biggest advantage of the merger would be the bargaining power that the combined entity would have on advertisers due to its sheer market dominance.
In May, RIL and Disney filed an application with the CCI seeking clearance for the Star-Viacom18 merger, claiming it won't significantly impact competition in the M&E industry.
On the subscription side, RIL and Disney have argued that both the bouquet and a la carte rates are regulated by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), as the merged entity will have to offer content to all TV distribution platforms at uniform rates.
Even discounts given by broadcasters on TV bouquets are regulated and uniform across platforms, ensuring that broadcasters do not discriminate between the two service providers.
In February, RIL and Disney signed deals to merge Star and Viacom18 to create a media behemoth with more than 100 TV channels and two streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema. The merged entity is likely to retain just one streaming platform, JioCinema.
RIL will control the JV with a 56% stake, followed by Disney with a 37% stake, and Bodhi Tree Systems, an entity promoted by
Uday Shankar
and James Murdoch, holding the remaining stake. The combined entity would have annual revenue of about ₹25,000 crore.
Reliance Foundation chairperson
Nita Ambani
will be the chairperson of the merged entity with Shankar serving as vice-chairperson.

Indian OTT universe grew 14% to 547 million in 2024: Ormax,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/indian-ott-universe-grew-14-to-547-million-in-2024-ormax/articleshow/112688847.cms,21-08-2024,"The Indian
OTT audience
universe has grown 14% year on year to 547.3 million users, translating to a penetration of 38.4%, as per The Ormax OTT Audience Report: 2024, which is based on a sample size of 12,000 across urban and rural
India
.
The growth in the universe is entirely driven by the
advertising
video on demand (AVOD) audience, which grew by 21%, while the
SVOD segment
witnessed a degrowth of 2%.
The report defines an OTT audience who watched at least one online video (free or paid) in the last one month. The report breaks down this universe by gender, age, NCCS, pop strata, states, and cities.
Speaking about the findings of the report, Keerat Grewal, Head of
Business
Development (Streaming, TV & Brands),
Ormax Media
, said: “While the overall expansion rate of the OTT universe has stably been around the 13% mark post-pandemic, this year’s report highlights the significant role of the AVOD segment in expanding the universe. The growth is driven by AVOD audiences, with most of the new entrants into the category watching video content only on YouTube and social media. The stagnation in SVOD audience size is also reflective of the trend whereby free content is driving OTT growth in small towns and rural India.""
The report reveals that India has 99.6 million active paid (B2C) OTT subscriptions, a number very similar to last year. The average number of platforms subscribed to per paying audience member has come down from 2.8 to 2.5 in 2024, highlighting the waning need among audiences to subscribe to too many platforms.

"CCI tunes in to RIL-Disney merger show, raises query",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/cci-tunes-in-to-ril-disney-merger-show-raises-query/articleshow/112662873.cms,21-08-2024,"New Delhi/Mumbai: The Competition Commission of India (
CCI
) has asked
Reliance Industries
and
Walt Disney
as to why their proposed $8.5-billion merger of media assets in the country should not be probed over
antitrust
concerns, people aware of the development said.
This could potentially delay
regulatory clearance
for the deal that is set to create India’s largest
entertainment player
, but such notices don’t mean the deal would be automatically derailed, they said.
If anything, they give the parties a chance to address the antitrust regulator’s concerns through adequate explanations, further commitments or actions, a regulatory official told ET.
Queries sent to CCI, Reliance and Walt Disney remained unanswered until the paper went to press.
Live Events
Reliance Industries had in May sought CCI clearance for the merger of Viacom18 and Star India. The deal would not cause any appreciable adverse effect on competition in India, it had said in a notice filed with the watchdog.
The combined entity, which had operating revenue of Rs 25,000 crore in FY23, will inherit 115 TV channels and two streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.
RIL
plans to merge Disney+ Hotstar with JioCinema once the merger deal gets the regulatory clearance.
The CCI, an industry source said, is concerned that the merged entity, in which Reliance will have a majority stake, could have power to influence attractive cricket broadcast rights and stoke competition concerns.
The proposed Star-Viacom18 entity will consolidate all the key
cricket rights
, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), International Cricket Council (ICC), Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Cricket Australia, and Cricket South Africa.
In the last few years, the two entities have made commitments of $10 billion towards cricket rights.
“There are preliminary questions relating to competition concerns. So, many questions about the potential grip of the merged entity over the relevant market are usually asked,” said one of the people cited earlier.
RIL and Disney have offered to shut certain channels in Hindi and regional markets to allay the concerns of the CCI over the potential adverse impact of the Star-Viacom18 combine on media and entertainment business.
‘Not the first time’
Industry experts say this is not the first time a single media company will be holding media rights to all the key cricket properties. In 2018, when the CCI approved Walt Disney's acquisition of Star India, the company had media rights to properties like IPL, ICC, BCCI, Pro Kabaddi League, and Indian Super League.
In 2017, DTH operator Dish TV had written to the CCI to prevent Star from bidding for the IPL media rights, contending that IPL media rights would give Star a monopoly in cricket broadcasting.
However, the CCI did not restrain Star from bidding for the IPL media rights, which the media company won for Rs 16,347 crore from 2018-22.
Also, as per the Sports Act 2007, sports broadcasters have to mandatorily share the feeds of sporting events of national importance including cricket tournaments featuring the Indian team with public broadcaster Prasar Bharati. IPL is outside the purview of the Sports Act.

PAP is a digital
entertainment company
that operates across the digital
media ecosystem
, managing influencers, and producing and publishing long- and short-form content.
For the last fiscal year ended March 31, PAP's net loss narrowed by 22% to Rs 14 crore while revenue declined 13% to Rs 90 crore. Expenses fell 15% to Rs 104 crore.
Saregama acquired PAP to grow its presence in the digital media ecosystem since it reaches more than 120 million digital-first customers on platforms like Instagram and YouTube.
In its annual report, Saregama said that it would leverage PAP's reach to further popularise its music library of over 150,000 songs among the 18-35 audience segment, besides creating synergies across the artist, influencer management, and long-format video creation businesses of the two companies.
PAP produces web series through its Dice Media brand. It also produces branded content videos through its owned channels, such as Filtercopy, Gobble and Nutshell.
Saregama India vice chairperson Avarna Jain said the company doubled its investments in new music in FY24 and plans to further increase investments by investing Rs 1,000 crore over the next three years, starting this fiscal year.
""In the coming years, diversification will remain a key strategy for us to leverage synergies across our business streams,"" she added.

media assets harms competition due to their power over cricket broadcast rights, four sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
In the biggest setback so far to their planned merger, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has privately told Disney and Reliance its view and asked the companies to explain why an investigation shouldn't be ordered, one of the sources said.
Reliance, Disney and CCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. All sources declined to be named as the CCI process is confidential.
""Cricket is the biggest pain point for the CCI,"" said one of the sources.
The merged company, which would be majority owned by Asia's richest man

Antitrust experts had warned the merger, announced in February, could face intense scrutiny as it will create India's biggest entertainment player which will compete with
Sony
,
Zee Entertainment
, Netflix and Amazon with a combined 120 TV channels and two streaming services.
The CCI earlier privately asked Reliance and Disney around 100 questions related to the merger. The companies have told the watchdog they are willing to sell fewer than 10 television channels to assuage concerns about market power and win an early approval, sources told Reuters.
The companies can still address the concerns of the CCI by offering more concessions, a second source said, adding that the notice for now ""is a precursor of things getting complicated."" ""The notice means that initially the CCI thinks the merger harms competition and whatever concessions offered are not enough,"" added the person.
A third source said CCI has given the companies 30 days to respond and explain their position.

"Disney, RIL may shut some channels to win CCI nod for merger",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-ril-may-shut-some-channels-to-win-cci-nod-for-merger/articleshow/112532532.cms,14-08-2024,"Mumbai:
Walt Disney
and
Reliance Industries
(
RIL
) have offered to shut Star India and
Viacom18
's Hindi and regional channels to win Competition Commission of India's (
CCI
) approval for their merger proposal, said people with knowledge of the matter.
The two companies might close flanking or secondary Hindi general entertainment channels (GECs) to retain both the flagship Hindi GECs-Star Plus and Colors- in the merged entity, the people said. Additionally, it plans to close channels in Kannada, Marathi, and Bangla language markets.
The merged entity of Star and Viacom18 will enjoy more than 40% share in Hindi, GEC, Kannada, Bangla, and Marathi markets. It will become a virtual monopoly in sports broadcasting, holding all the key cricket and non-cricket rights.
Any entity that has more than 40% market share in a category is considered dominant by the CCI.
RIL and
Disney
declined to comment.
Live Events
People said the two companies are hoping that the CCI might not ask them to shut or divest their flagship Hindi GECs, Star Plus and Colors, or part with certain cricket properties in exchange for shutting flanking Hindi GECs.
""Except the flagship channels, other Hindi GECs might be closed down. In the regional markets, the channels that are struggling will be shut down. Star has much more powerful regional channels than Viacom18, which is strong only in the Kannada market,"" one of the persons said.
Both RIL and Disney are hoping to close the merger by October. The two companies have until February 2026 to complete the entire process.
The CCI has reached out to other media and entertainment companies to gauge the impact of the merger on the industry.
One of the broadcasters is believed to have suggested to CCI that Star-Viacom18 should be asked to part with certain cricket properties since the proposed merged entity will become too powerful in sports with properties like
IPL
, ICC, BCCI, Premier League, Pro Kabaddi League, and Indian Super League.
""Asking Star-Viacom18 to part with cricket properties will not be feasible since these properties are eventually owned by sporting bodies like the BCCI and not the broadcasters,"" said a legal expert, adding the broadcasters only have the right to broadcast live sports and commercially exploit them for a specific tenure.
As per the merger pact, RIL will have a controlling 56% stake in the Star-Viacom18 combined entity with Walt Disney holding 37%. The proposed merged entity will have over 110 TV channels and two streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.
Bodhi Tree Systems, a company promoted by James Murdoch and Uday Shankar, will own a 7% stake in the new entity.
Shankar will serve as the vice chairperson of the proposed merged entity's board. Nita Ambani, wife of RIL promoter Mukesh Ambani, will be the chairperson.
The merger is subject to regulatory approvals, including those from National Company Law Tribunal and the CCI.
Star-Viacom18 will be a media goliath with a valuation of over ₹70,000 crore, with Viacom18 and Star being valued at roughly ₹33,000 crore and ₹26,000 crore respectively.
Additionally, RIL will infuse ₹11,500 crore in the merged entity.

Industry wants open discussion on fresh Broadcast Bill draft,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/industry-wants-open-discussion-on-fresh-broadcast-bill-draft/articleshow/112511476.cms,14-08-2024,"The media industry expects the ministry of information and broadcasting (
MIB
) to hold an open and transparent
consultation process
before it comes out with a fresh draft of the Broadcast Services
Regulation
Bill.
The MIB has faced criticism for the opaque manner in which it circulated the second draft of the
Broadcast Bill
with certain
stakeholders
at the end July. The first draft of the bill, which was released in November 2023, was put up for public consultation; however, the comments were not made public.
""We expect the MIB to hold a transparent consultation process and take the views of all the stakeholders, including bodies like the
Editors Guild of India
, before coming out with the fresh draft,"" said Anant Nath, the president of the non-profit organisation of journalists.
He also said that the Broadcast Bill should look to strengthen the self-regulatory mechanism rather than empower the
government
and bureaucracy to take decisions on pulling down content or taking channels off air.
""One possible option can be to strengthen a body like the Press Council of India, which is answerable to parliament, rather than giving powers to the Broadcast Advisory Council, which only comprises government officials,"" Nath added.
Live Events
Sources said the second draft of the bill has been kept on the backburner, with the ministry asking stakeholders to return the watermarked copies of the bill that were shared with them recently.
In a statement on Monday, the MIB said that a fresh draft will be published after detailed consultations with stakeholders. It has solicited comments and suggestions from stakeholders on the draft bill until October 15.
In the second draft of the bill, one of the most contentious clauses was treating
social media
users beyond a certain threshold, which was to be notified later, as OTT broadcasting service operators or digital news broadcasters.
Under this clause, the social media user publishing the content would be responsible for complying with the requirements of the act, including the three-tier grievance redressal mechanism.
Trilegal Partner TMT Nikhil Narendran said that the government should engage all the stakeholders in the consultation process considering the far-reaching impact the law will have on the TV and digital ecosystems.
""The MIB was very secretive about the second draft of the broadcast bill, which was only shared with a few stakeholders. It would be in everyone's interest, including the government, to follow a transparent consultation process leading up to the fresh draft,"" he added.
A media executive noted that there was no clarity whether the stakeholders have to send comments on the first draft or the second draft since MIB's statement doesn't clearly mention that the second draft has been withdrawn.
The Broadcast Bill, which will replace the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995, once it becomes an Act, will govern OTT, cable TV, direct-to-home (DTH), headend-in-the-sky (HITS), internet protocol television (IPTV), and radio.
Industry bodies like Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF), News Broadcasters and Digital Foundation (NBDA), and Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) have made submissions to the MIB that over-the-top (OTT) platforms must be kept outside the purview of the Broadcast Bill since they are distinct from linear broadcasting services.
Last week, the MIB minister of state stated that the government is adopting a differentiated approach for regulating content on
OTT platforms
and cable TV networks (linear TV).
Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Dr L Murugan said the OTT platforms are regulated as per the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, while cable TV is governed by the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Regulations.
""Government is guided by a differentiated approach for
content regulation
on OTT platforms and cable TV networks, as the content in the former is consumed on a demand basis, whereas in the latter, it is in a linear manner,"" Murugan told the Rajya Sabha last week.

Reliance
and Walt Disney have offered to sell some channels to win faster
antitrust approval
for their $8.5 billion India media assets merger, but are resisting changes to
cricket broadcast rights
they own, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Antitrust experts have warned that the
Reliance-Disney merger
, announced in February, could face intense scrutiny as it will create India's biggest
entertainment player
which will compete with Sony,
Zee Entertainment
, Netflix and Amazon with a combined 120
TV channels
and two streaming services.
The merged company, which will be majority owned by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani's Reliance, will also have lucrative rights worth billions of dollars for the broadcast of cricket, raising pricing power fears and its grip over advertisers.
After the Competition Commission of India (CCI) privately asked
Reliance
and Disney around 100 questions related to the merger, the companies have told the watchdog they are willing to sell some TV channels - fewer than 10 - to assuage concerns of market power and win an early approval, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Also Read:
Viacom18, Star India expect to complete merger by October
Live Events
The sources said some of the concessions being offered relate to regional Indian language channels where the two companies may have a dominant market share.
Zee and Sony planned to create a $10 billion TV behemoth in India and in 2022 offered concessions by selling three TV channels. That helped them win
CCI approval
, but the merger eventually collapsed.
CCI's notification approving that deal, which contained details of the competitive landscape, showed that in local language Marathi, Disney and Reliance channels back then had a combined market share of between 65% and 75%. In Bengali language entertainment channels, the two had as much as a 50% market share.
Disney declined to comment. Reliance and the CCI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
CRICKET RIGHTS WOES
Cricket is another point of contention in the merger process. The sport has a fanatical following in India and matches are sought after by advertisers.
Reliance-Disney will own digital and TV cricket rights for top cricket leagues, including for the world's most valuable cricket tournament, the Indian Premier League (IPL).
Jefferies said the Disney-Reliance entity will have a 40% share of the advertising market in TV and streaming segments.
K.K Sharma, a former head of mergers at CCI, has told Reuters previously: ""With Disney and Reliance together, hardly anything of cricket will be left ... Here, it is not merely dominance but almost an absolute control over cricket.""
The CCI is studying the market power of the companies in cricket rights and has not raised any concerns so far, but the companies have argued with the CCI that the rights will expire in 2027 and 2028 and can't be sold right now, the sources said.
Further, the companies have raised concerns that any sub-licensing of cricket rights to another party would also require prior approvals from the Indian cricket board, which could prolong the approval process, the sources said.
""The companies are arguing that nothing can be done on cricket rights,"" one of the sources said.

(MIB) has received 269
complaints against TV channels
in the last five years from 2019-23, minister of state for information and broadcasting and parliamentary affairs
Dr. L Murugan
said in the Rajya Sabha last week.
In 2019, the ministry received 101 complaints against TV channels, the highest in the last five years, while in 2020, it received only seven complaints, the lowest in the last five years.
The number of complaints increased to 66 in 2023, from 52 in 2022 and 43 in 2021.
Clause 25 of the Policy Guidelines for Uplinking and Downlinking of Satellite
TV Channels
in India, 2022, mandates that broadcasters who breach these guidelines will face penal actions.
In response to another question, the minister revealed that the ministry has received 156 applications for TV channel licences over the past five years.
Live Events
Out of the 156 applications for new TV channel licences across news and non-news categories, 117 applications were approved, 20 were closed, and 19 are pending due to insolvency and trademark issues.
Responding to another question, Dr. Murugan said that the MIB has granted permission to 57 news channels and cancelled licences of 18 news channels in the last five years.
Further, the transmission of three channels was suspended for a specific period.
The MIB granted permissions to 14 channels each in 2019, 2022, and 2023. In 2020 and 2021, permissions were granted to six and nine TV channels.
Quoting Telecom Regulatory Authority of India data, the minister also said that the cable TV subscribers in India have decreased from 103 million in 2020 to 64 million in 2023, partly due to the rise of OTT platforms.

TRAI begins consultation process on TV broadcast audits,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/trai-begins-consultation-process-on-tv-broadcast-audits/articleshow/112407859.cms,09-08-2024,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
TRAI
) is holding a consultation exercise to determine whether the existing
audit mechanism
, which mandates distribution platform operators (
DPOs
) to cause audits of their subscriber management system (
SMS
) once a year, should be retained, modified, or replaced with a new mechanism.
In case the DPO-caused audit mechanism is scrapped, the regulator has asked the stakeholders to suggest mechanisms that should be adopted to ensure timely sharing of monthly
subscription reports
by the DPOs to the
broadcasters
.
In its consultation paper, the TRAI noted that many DPOs have failed to audit their SMS in a time-bound manner despite the financial disincentives imposed on them by the regulator.
Broadcasters have been requesting the TRAI to scrap the provision of DPO-caused audits from the regulatory framework while retaining broadcaster-caused audits.
DPOs pay subscription fees to broadcasters based on the SMS reports generated every month. According to the FICCI-EY 2024 report, the
broadcasting sector
generated Rs 40,000 crore in subscription revenue in 2023.
Live Events
TRAI has empaneled 52 auditors besides Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL) for auditing the SMS of the DPOs.
The regulator is also seeking responses on whether small DPOs should be subjected to an annual compulsory audit considering the manpower and financial constraints that they face and the criteria that should be adopted to define a small DPO.
TV broadcasters have often been at loggerheads with the DPOs over lack of transparency in SMS audits. Recently, Sony Pictures alleged that it had found discrepancies in Tata Play's SMS, a charge that the latter has denied.
The regulator has also asked stakeholders to suggest whether the financial year should be adopted in place of the calendar year for DPO audits.
Another issue put up for consultation by the TRAI is whether the DPOs should be mandated to complete the annual audit of their SMS by September 30 every year.
If the broadcasters are unsatisfied with the DPO audit, they can cause an audit of the DPO, which must be completed between October 1 and December 31, the regulator noted.
As per the Interconnection Regulations 2017, there should be a minimum and a maximum gap of 6 and 18 months respectively, between two annual audits caused by a DPO.
The regulator is also seeking views on amending the regulations in light of the infrastructure sharing between DPOs allowed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB).
It has also asked the stakeholders whether new provisions need to be added to facilitate infrastructure sharing among the DPOs like cable TV, DTH, and Headend in the Sky (HITS).
TRAI noted that the provisions for conducting audits were introduced to ensure that the monthly subscription reports made available by the distributors are accurate and there are no manipulations.

The public broadcaster will categorise
TV channels
on the proposed OTT app into four groups based on language and genre, including English news channels, Hindi news channels, non-news channels (all languages), and non-news channels (regional).
Prasar Bharati has proposed a 65:35 revenue share for TV channels, with 65% going to the channel and the public broadcaster retaining the rest.
The revenue share will be calculated after adjusting Prasar Bharati's expenses for the channel, including transcoding, CDN costs, and agency commissions.
Successful channels will have to provide a clean feed for streaming on the OTT platform.
Prasar Bharati will insert ads on the OTT stream based on the availability of the SCTE-35 marker at the appropriate juncture.
Unsold commercial time will be used for running promos of Prasar Bharati and its partner channels.
The Directorate of
Advertising
and Visual Publicity (DAVP) rate card will be used to rank all applicant TV channels.
Channels with the highest DAVP rates in their respective categories will be allowed to place their channels on the OTT platform.
Prasar Bharati will issue a letter of allotment to the successful channels, who have to sign an agreement within 15 days of receiving it.

"Delhi HC appoints arbitrator to settle dispute between PVR INOX, Ansal Plaza Mall over sealed multiplex",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/delhi-hc-appoints-arbitrator-to-settle-dispute-between-pvr-inox-ansal-plaza-mall-over-sealed-multiplex/articleshow/112214080.cms,02-08-2024,"The
Delhi High Court
has appointed an
arbitrator
to resolve the
dispute
between
PVR INOX
and
Ansal Plaza Mall
in Greater Noida.
PVR INOX
claims that its four-screen multiplex at Ansal Plaza Mall was sealed due to unpaid government dues by the lessor,
Sheetal Ansal
.
PVR INOX has filed a claim of approximately Rs 4.5 crore in the Delhi High Court, seeking
arbitration
to address the issue.
In an order passed by Justice C Hari Shankar, he said, ""Prima facie, an arbitrable dispute has arisen between the parties, which is amenable to arbitration in terms of the arbitration clause extracted. As the parties have not been able to come to a consensus regarding the arbitrator to arbitrate on the disputes, this Court has to intervene. Accordingly, this Court appoints the arbitrator to arbitrate on the disputes between the parties. Court noted that the Counsel for Respondent/lessor also be permitted for counter-claim to be agitated in the arbitration proceedings.""
It was submitted by Advocate Sumit Gehlot for the petitioner that his client, PVR INOX, entered into registered lease agreement dated 07.06.2018 with lessor Sheetal Ansal and took four screen multiplex space situated at 3rd and 4th floors of Ansal Plaza Mall, Knowledge Park-1, Greater Noida.
Under the lease agreement, PVR INOX deposited Rs 1.26 crore as security and invested significantly in moveable assets, including furniture, equipment, and interior works, to operate its multiplex. The SDM Gautam Budh Nagar Sadar issued a notice on June 6, 2022, for recovery of Rs 26.33 crore in statutory dues from Ansal Property and Infrastructure Ltd. Despite PVR INOX's repeated requests, the lessor did not address the issue, leading to the sealing of the mall, including the multiplex, on July 23, 2022.

"Sony, Tata Play spar over removal of TV channels from DTH packs",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-tata-play-spar-over-removal-of-tv-channels-from-dth-packs/articleshow/112204729.cms,01-08-2024,"Broadcaster
Sony
Pictures Networks India (
SPNI
) and direct-to-home (DTH) operator
Tata Play
are sparring over the removal of
TV channels
from consumer packs, with the former mulling
legal options
.
Tata Play has started removing SPNI channels from its bouquet, contending that the broadcaster's channels, including flagship channel Sony Entertainment Television (SET), are losing popularity.
In a statement, SPNI claimed that the removal of channels from consumer packs is a retaliatory move that follows a request from the broadcaster to audit the DTH operator's
subscriber management system
(SMS) due to the discrepancies observed in recent years.
Sources close to the development say that SPNI is considering legal options against Tata Play's decision as the two companies have a valid contract in place that was renewed in Q1 this year.
Justifying the move, Tata Play CEO Harit Nagpal said that the company's customers will save Rs 50-60 due to the removal of SPNI's channels from packages.
Live Events
He further clarified that the channel removal does not violate regulations, and Tata Play's SMS, regularly audited by TRAI auditors, is open for broadcaster audit.
""As a service provider, I am duty-bound to take care of the interests of my
broadcast partners
by providing them reach and my customers by reducing burden on them,"" he stated.
Nagpal also argued that over 50% of Tata Play's subscriber base, which totals up to nearly 10 million subscribers, has subscribed to SPNI's Hindi channel pack, whereas SET has just 9% share of the Hindi GEC market.
Market watchers predict an increase in
disputes
between broadcasters and distributors due to stagnation in the pay-TV business as a result of increased competition from video streamers and DD Free Dish.
""Viacom18 and Disney Star are seeking significant payout hikes from distributors due to their massive investments in sports. Distributors will have to reallocate content spending among broadcasters as the overall subscription revenue bucket shrinks,"" said a TV distribution executive.
Nagpal said users who want to subscribe to the SPNI bouquet or a la carte channels can still do so by giving a missed call. ""Since morning, SPNI channels have been removed from 1 million users' packs. However, we have received only 18,000 requests from customers for Sony channels/packs throughout the day,"" he added.
SPNI also accused Tata Play of making an arbitrary decision without any prior notice or consideration for their subscribers' preferences.
The two companies had previously sparred over the removal of SonyLIV from Tata Play's OTT packs. Tata Play had removed SonyLIV from its Binge OTT aggregation service due to the increased payout sought by the platform during contract renewal.

Tata Play removes Sony channels from curated packs due to low viewership,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tata-play-removes-sony-channels-from-curated-packs-due-to-low-viewership/articleshow/112198765.cms,02-08-2024,"Tata Play
, an Indian subscription-based satellite television service provider, has decided to remove
Sony
Entertainment channels from its specially curated subscriber packs. This decision, revealed on Thursday, was primarily driven by the low viewership of these channels.
Harit Nagpal, MD & CEO of Tata Play, explained the rationale behind this move. ""We at Tata Play have always prioritized customers while designing our processes. Our analysis, supported by
BARC
data, reveals that most
subscribers
have 4 or more times the number of channels than they actively watch. Due to the lack of return path data, it is not possible to track who’s watching and who’s not. Consequently, we are streamlining channel packs by removing less-watched channels and adjusting monthly charges accordingly,"" he stated.
Subscribers who still wish to watch the removed channels can easily reinstate them by giving a missed call. Nagpal added, ""We anticipate that at least 75% of customers whose packs have been modified will benefit from the reduced charges.""
This change aims to reduce the financial burden on subscribers who often pay for numerous channels they do not watch, allowing for more cost-effective and customised viewing options.

Chatterjee and Sreeram will report to
Kiran Mani
, the CEO of digital ventures at Viacom18. Mani formerly worked for Google as the General Manager and MD for Android and Google Play in Asia Pacific.

It has become India's fastest-growing streaming platform, offering free access to popular cricket and entertainment properties like the Indian Premier League and Bigg Boss. It also hosts premium Hollywood content from global content providers like HBO, NBC Universal, and Paramount.
Viacom18, promoted by Reliance Industries and
Bodhi Tree

Star terminates $1.5 billion ICC TV rights deal with Zee,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/star-terminates-1-5-billion-icc-tv-rights-deal-with-zee/articleshow/112172086.cms,31-07-2024,"Disney-owned
Star India
has terminated its alliance agreement with
Zee Entertainment
for the $1.5 billion International Cricket Council (ICC) TV rights on June 20, according to a regulatory filing by Zee.
However, the broadcaster has decided to seek damages during the arbitration proceedings, which have not yet been quantified.
Star
had initiated arbitration proceedings against
Zee
before the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) on 14 March.
On August 26, 2022, Star had entered into an alliance agreement with Zee to sublicense
ICC TV rights
for Men's and Under-19 (U-19) global events for a period of four years till 2027.
Zee didn't go ahead with the alliance agreement due to the failure of its merger deal with Sony Pictures Networks India. As a standalone entity, Zee would have found it challenging to service the ICC TV rights deal.
The company has communicated to Star that the alliance agreement cannot be proceeded with and has also sought a refund of Rs 69 crore that it has already paid.
Live Events
According to Zee, the performance of the alliance agreement was subject to certain conditions precedent, including submission of financial commitments, provision of bank guarantee and corporate guarantee, and pending final ICC approval for the sub-licensing deal.
Zee has accrued Rs 72.14 crore towards bank guarantee commission and interest expenses for its share of bank guarantee and deposit, as per the alliance agreement.
Earlier, Star had sent letters to Zee through its legal counsel alleging breach of the alliance agreement on account of non-payment of dues for the rights in relation to the first installment of the rights fee aggregating to $203.56 million, along with the payment for bank guarantee commission and deposit interest aggregating Rs 17 crore, and financial commitments including furnishing of corporate guarantee.
Zee has countered Star by stating that the latter has not acted in accordance with the alliance agreement and has failed to obtain necessary approvals and execute necessary documentation and agreements.
The company also added that Star, by its conduct, has breached the Alliance agreement and is in default of the terms thereof, and consequently, the contract stands repudiated.
Based on the available information and legal advice, Zee believes it has strong and valid grounds to defend any claims and does not expect any material adverse impact with respect to the above as in its view the contract has been repudiated and no adjustments are required to the accompanying Statement.

Adani Enterprises infused Rs 900 crore into media arm,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/adani-enterprises-infused-rs-900-crore-into-media-arm/articleshow/112147273.cms,31-07-2024,"Adani Enterprises
invested Rs 900 crore in its wholly-owned media arm,
AMG Media Networks
, in the last financial year by subscribing to 90 crore 0% compulsory

The flagship of Gautam Adani-promoted port-to-power conglomerate has been on an acquisition spree after incorporating AMG Media Networks in April 2022. The company has been actively evaluating assets in the media and entertainment sector, recognising it as a crucial growth area.
AMG acquired 76% of category I and 99.26% of category II shares of news agency
IANS India
earlier this year. IANS became a subsidiary of the group on January 17.
In its annual report, Adani said it is finalising the fair value of IANS' assets and liabilities as per Ind AS 103 accounting standards. Pending this, IANS has been accounted for on a provisional fair valuation basis, with a recorded goodwill of Rs 7.42 crore, it added.
AMG Media acquired Quintillion Business Media, which owned and operated business news website BQ Prime, for Rs 100 crore in two separate transactions spread across FY23 and FY24. BQ Prime has been merged into
NDTV
Profit.
Live Events
The group, which is in the process of determining the fair values of Quintillion, has accounted for the company on a provisional fair valuation basis and recorded a goodwill of Rs 128.77 crore in FY24.
The company also bought a controlling 64.71% stake in NDTV, founded by Prannoy and Radhika Roy, for Rs 900.69 crore in cash in FY23. NDTV operates six TV news channels and digital news platform NDTV.com.
""Our media entity (NDTV) has expanded its presence regionally and scaled digitally, with a 39% increase in global digital traffic. We also invested in next-generation infrastructure, with new facilities in BKC, Mumbai, and NCR, Delhi,"" said Adani Enterprises CMD Gautam Adani.
NDTV plans to expand its digital portfolio, create digital-first content in multiple languages, and explore new verticals to drive growth. It launched four news channels last fiscal, including three regional channels, and one business channel.
Going forward, it plans to launch high definition (HD) feeds of NDTV 24x7, NDTV India, and NDTV Profit. It has also already secured licences from the ministry of information and broadcasting.

From metros to villages: The streaming wave sweeping across India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/from-metros-to-villages-the-streaming-wave-sweeping-across-india/articleshow/112086747.cms,28-07-2024,"At home, we love gathering to watch cricket, especially when India plays a crucial match. The recent ICC Men’s T20 World Cup final was riveting, not just because of the game itself, but also the diverse reactions from everyone in the room. Our audience ranged from kids to elders, each with their own opinions, rituals, and superstitions. One friend watched only when India batted while a cousin took a sip of water before each over bowled by Bumrah. And then it struck me: despite belonging to the same urban Indian milieu, we were all so starkly different from one another—in both obvious and subtle ways.
This insight, I feel, is extremely crucial, especially in today's media and entertainment space. I've heard many peers talk about creating content for ""India"" and ""Bharat,"" which is all well and good. But can we really split our wonderful nation into stark binaries of urban and rural? Or mainstream and fringe? Or Hindi/English and everything else? I think not. The complex beauty of
Indian audiences
lies in their minute fragmentation. It’s not just about different regions, religions, languages, and cultures—we are a people with a billion views, a billion tastes, a billion likes and dislikes. Daunting, isn’t it? To give you a fun fact, the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 was watched on Disney+ Hotstar in more than 99.5% of all Indian pincodes!
And that, I feel, is where both the challenge and the opportunity lie for
content creators
, producers and
OTT platforms
. To truly resonate with Indian audiences, we need to create entertainment that reflects this amazing diversity within our society. It's not enough to cater to broad categories; creators must understand the nuanced preferences and cultural touchstones that define different segments of the population. We need to think of not one - but catering to various segments of India! This means investing in diverse stories, experimenting with
regional languages
, and embracing new and exciting genres and formats—all enhanced by cutting-edge technology to elevate the experience further.
Growth Beyond Metros: The Next Wave
The next wave of OTT growth is emerging from smaller cities, with Disney+ Hotstar at the forefront. Supported by the rapid penetration of mobile and internet services in rural markets, this shift is revolutionising the digital landscape. The power of
digital content
to unify India’s diverse population is unparalleled. Major events like the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 underscored this fact, with millions tuning in from various regions and demographics. This impact was especially noticeable in non-metros, where nearly half of Disney+ Hotstar’s reach came from Tier 2 cities and beyond during this tournament. Interestingly, people across age groups have embraced the OTT wave with nearly 40-45% viewers belonging to the age group of under 24 years, 30% from 25-35 year old age group and remaining ~25% of viewers from 35+ age group.
Democratising Content: Free
Mobile Streaming
In a country that breathes entertainment and is shaped by a culture surrounded by stories and iconic moments from various genres, streaming platforms have become one of the biggest binding agents in this vast and diverse nation. Recognising this, Disney+ Hotstar made the bold move to stream not just sports events but a variety of content for free on mobile devices. This initiative dramatically expanded the platform's reach, allowing fans from diverse backgrounds to engage with their favourite shows and movies. By offering free mobile streaming, Disney+ Hotstar not only broke down financial barriers but also set new records in concurrent viewership during major events like the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023. Additionally, 1 out of 3 Disney+ Hotstar cricket viewers on the platform also watched
entertainment content
. Alongside the recent ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, Disney+ Hotstar also introduced a new content strategy by releasing their series ‘Gunaah’ for free on mobile and will continue to release more free content to cater to the many Indias!
Live Events
Embracing Hybrid Models: Freemium Strategy
With its
freemium model
, Disney+ Hotstar strikes a balance between ad revenue and subscription offerings. This strategy has proven successful, particularly during high-profile events. The platform's ability to attract massive viewership while providing free access on mobile devices has set new standards in the streaming industry. The success during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 and the recent ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 is a testament to this strategy. We are a firm believer that if you focus on the user and engaging her, the revenue will follow.
A Platform of Choice for Advertisers
Disney+ Hotstar drives significant value for advertisers through its high-quality content and freemium strategy across sports and entertainment. The platform offers a wide variety of ad formats, multiple targeting options, and reaches highly engaged users, making it a preferred choice for advertisers looking to maximise their impact. The ability to blend advertising seamlessly with content has created a win-win scenario for both viewers and advertisers.
Taking Content to All of India
Keeping the viewer at the heart of its content strategy, Disney+ Hotstar consistently enhances its extensive library with top-notch global and local content selections backed by strong consumer insights. The platform continues to strike a good balance between sports and entertainment content and viewers who come in to watch high-impact sports events stay on for highly engaging entertainment offerings. This approach ensures a broad appeal across different viewer segments, catering to diverse tastes and preferences. We've observed that more than 50% of consumption of dubbed international content comes in the local languages. So, when your favourite Super Hero fluently speaks Telugu, it's not just a marketing gimmick – it's a testament to the unifying power of language in the ever-evolving landscape of Indian entertainment.Over the last year, we have witnessed a 2x increase in viewership of our Hindi shows and movies such as 12th Fail and The Night Manager across Tamil and Telugu speaking regions owing to the availability of dubs in both languages.
Deep Regional Focus: Engaging Diverse Audiences
Disney+ Hotstar is intensifying efforts to deliver content in multiple Indian languages, supporting originals in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam. With hits across languages and genres, the platform is seeing significant success in regional storytelling. This regional focus ensures that content is accessible and relatable to a wider audience, reinforcing the platform's commitment to diversity. Notably, in 2023 nearly half of Hindi users on Disney+ Hotstar significantly consume South Indian content. In fact, Telugu productions like Salaar and Veera Simha Reddy have found immense success in Hindi-speaking markets. Manjummel Boys, Aavesham and King of Kotha in Malayalam are other examples of this.
In the last two years we have actively dubbed two-thirds of the titles (65%) launched on Disney+ Hotstar into non-primary languages to cater to the diverse audience set across the country. The availability of Hindi content dubbed into regional languages, for example, has increased the reach of Hindi content like ""Brahm?stra: Part One – Shiva"", ""Aakhri Sach” and “Babli Bouncer” across regional markets. It also helped that these movies featured popular regional megastars like Nagarjuna and Tamannaah Bhatia which further added to their appeal. Another example of this is “12th Fail” which became our most-watched film in 2023. In fact, dubbing international titles, especially Marvel franchises, in local languages has significantly enhanced their appeal, and further helped in expanding the platform's reach.
Interactivity and Innovation: Blending Tech and Storytelling
With shows like 'Koffee With Karan' and ‘The Legend of Hanuman', Disney+ Hotstar is blending technology and storytelling through innovative formats of animation, CGI, interactivity and more. These interactive and immersive experiences not only captivate audiences but also set new benchmarks in digital entertainment. Disney+ Hotstar’s efforts in making a variety of content accessible to all have strengthened this unity, showing that technology can bridge divides and bring people together over a shared love for both entertainment and sports content. For LIVE cricket, the platform has brought forth accessibility features like the Indian Sign Language feed and an Audio Descriptive feed, MaxView (vertical viewing), optimized data saving and more.
As we move forward, we remain focused on the billion plus Indians and the many Indias. The lessons learned and innovations introduced contribute towards shaping the future of streaming in India, making it more inclusive and engaging than ever before. Whether it's sports, movies, or TV shows, the commitment to delivering a diverse and high-quality viewing experience that caters to everyone across the country is paramount. After all, the path to success in India's dynamic media landscape lies in celebrating and harnessing the country's inherent diversity. It's a challenge that requires creativity, empathy, and an unwavering commitment to authenticity. But for those who rise to the occasion, the rewards—both in terms of audience appreciation and market share—can be extraordinary.

NCLT lists Disney's Star India and Reliance's Viacom18 merger plea hearing on August 1 for final disposal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/nclt-lists-disneys-star-india-and-reliances-viacom18-merger-plea-hearing-on-august-1-for-final-disposal/articleshow/112054990.cms,27-07-2024,"The
National Company Law Tribunal
(
NCLT
) has listed Walt Disney-owned
Star India
and
Reliance Industries
(RIL)-promoted
Viacom18
's merger application for hearing and final disposal on August 1.
Legal experts say that NCLT Mumbai has ordered a final hearing on 1 August to decide whether to sanction the scheme.
In an order sheet of the hearing held on July 11, the division bench of technical member Anu Jagmohan Singh and judicial member Kishore Vemulapalli asked the parties to serve a fresh notice of final hearing to the central/state governments, tax authorities, and regulatory bodies like the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
The notices must contain the statement that if no response is received within 30 days, it will be presumed that the authorities have no objections to the scheme.
Himanshu Vidhani, partner at law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan, said the market understanding is that this scheme consists of two parts: (i) the transfer of certain identified assets of Viacom’s TV to Digital18, followed by the demerger and vesting of these identified assets from Digital18 to Star.
Live Events
“The NCLT had by this order directed that this matter will be taken up for final hearing on 1 August, at which time the NCLT will decide whether the scheme should be sanctioned,” said Vidhani.
“If the scheme is sanctioned, the same will have to be effective as per its terms and will then have to be submitted for adjudication of stamp duty with the superintendent of stamps,” he further adds.
After the NCLT sanctions the scheme, the merger will require CCI clearance. The merger is currently being scrutinised by the CCI due to the potential impact it will have on the TV broadcasting and streaming businesses.
On May 7, the tribunal admitted the merger scheme between Star India, Viacom18, and Digital18, marking the first step towards completing the mega transaction.
During the hearing, the parties informed the NCLT that the scheme of arrangement between the three companies has been approved by secured and unsecured creditors besides equity and preference shareholders.
As part of the scheme of arrangement, Digital18 intends to transfer Viacom18's assets to Star India, which will allot proportionate shares to the former. Star will also allot shares to RIL for a $1.4 billion fund infusion.
Following the allotment, Star's shareholding will be divided among
Walt Disney
(36.63%), Digital18 (46.11%), and RIL (16.34%).
Star India and Viacom18 have agreed to merge operations, forming India's largest media and entertainment business valued at $8.5 billion, with a combined FY23 topline of Rs 25,000 crore.

Media industry likely to seek reversal of Karnataka government decision on cess levy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/media-industry-likely-to-seek-reversal-of-karnataka-government-decision-on-cess-levy/articleshow/112029213.cms,26-07-2024,"Media and entertainment industry bodies are planning to submit representations to the
Karnataka government
for a reversal of the 1-2% cess on
cinema tickets
besides TV and over-the-top (OTT) subscription fees, people familiar with the development said.
The Cine and Cultural Activists Welfare Cess will also be imposed on all revenue generated from related establishments such as cinema theatres, multiplex halls, OTT,
TV channels
and other such establishments notified by the government.
Apart from the state government, the industry bodies could also petition the governor and the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB), the nodal ministry for TV, OTT and film industries, they added.
The industry bodies that are likely to make representations include the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF), Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), Multiplex Association of India (MAI) and Producers Guild of India (PGI).
If the state government refuses to roll back the cess on movie tickets and OTT subscriptions, the industry bodies could also seek legal remedy by challenging the Karnataka Cine & Cultural Activists Welfare Bill's applicability to OTT platforms and TV channels.

""The bill may lead to similar legislation being passed by other state governments. It would also lead to increased costs for consumers,"" a senior media executive said on condition of anonymity.
Legal experts say that the proposed tax would disrupt the uniform tax structure envisaged under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime and create an uneven playing field for various forms of entertainment.
""The imposition of any cess on a supply or consumption will lead to tax cascading and ultimately increase the price of the supply. The cess should be imposed only under exceptional circumstances, as such additional levies will be against the broad objectives of GST, thereby leading to constitutional debates,"" said Abhishek Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers.
The bill, which seeks to establish a welfare fund for artists and technicians in the film industry in Karnataka, has been passed by both houses of the state legislature and is awaiting the governor's assent.
PVR Inox chief business planning and strategy officer Kamal Gianchandani, who is also the president of MAI, said that the cess will be detrimental for the industry.
He also said the cess defeats the purpose of ‘one nation-one tax’ under the GST regime. While stating that MAI will raise its concerns with the state government, Gianchandani said legal remedy is always an option.

Regional print media companies to experience 8-9% revenue growth in FY25: Crisil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/regional-print-media-companies-to-experience-8-9-revenue-growth-in-fy25-crisil/articleshow/112010184.cms,25-07-2024,"Regional print media companies
are expected to experience an 8-9% increase in
revenue
this
fiscal year
due to robust
advertising revenue growth
and a loyal subscriber base, says a Crisil report.
However, the report also stated that we will closely monitor the impact of economic changes, shifts in consumer preferences, or global factors affecting
newsprint prices
.
Crisil's analysis of eight regional print media players, which account for 60% of the regional print circulation, predicts healthy growth and softening newsprint prices will increase operating profitability by 20-22%, extending the 400 bps margin expansion from last fiscal due to a drop in newsprint prices.
Ad revenue, which accounts for two-thirds of regional print media companies' topline, is strongly linked to economic sentiment and
advertising spending
by corporates and governments.
“Economic sentiment remains positive, as reflected by growing budgetary spend on
advertising
and marketing by corporates. Advertisement demand from key contributing sectors such as automobiles, FMCG3, education, e-commerce, real estate, and services is also buoyant from local establishments as they prefer regional print players owing to the latter's wide reach in the locality,"" said Crisil Ratings Senior Director and Deputy Chief Ratings Officer Manish Gupta.
Live Events
""All this will lead to 9-10% growth in overall advertising revenue this fiscal, offsetting a moderation in the government segment. This contrasts with last fiscal, when increased government spending on advertisements in the run-up to the general elections had propelled a similar growth in advertising revenue.”
Subscription revenue
, accounting for around 25% of the sector's topline, remains resilient, indicating the continued popularity of
vernacular print media
in India despite strong digital media traction, the report stated.
Vernacular print players are expected to see a 2-4% growth in subscription revenue this fiscal due to compulsive reading habits and hyper-localised content.
Regional print players have started to push for subscriptions in areas adjacent to their existing coverage area. Earlier, these players were deliberately slow in growing their subscriber base as cover prices were not sufficient to absorb the cost of newsprint paper.
The prices of newsprint paper, which is a key raw material and accounts for 35–40% of the total operating cost of print media companies, continue to soften on the back of modest global demand and easing of supply chain issues.
Newsprint prices rose a whopping 41% in fiscal 2023 due to logistical disruptions amid the Russia-Ukraine war, as Russia accounts for more than half of the total newsprint paper imports.
Crisil Ratings Director Ankit Kedia noted, “A steep on-year fall of 21% in newsprint prices during fiscal 2024 shored up the operating profitability of regional print media companies by 400 bps to 18-20% during the fiscal. While newsprint prices have remained volatile since October 2023 due to the prevailing shipping issues around the Red Sea, they are still well below their average levels of fiscal 2024 and are expected to remain range bound because of muted global demand and adequate supply. This, coupled with the projected revenue growth, will further expand margin by 200 bps to a healthy 20-22% this fiscal.""
The higher margin will result in the Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) improving to 15-16% this fiscal (versus 14-15% the previous fiscal) in the absence of any major capex plans. This, along with their already strong balance sheets (marked by low to nil debt and cash-positive positions), will strengthen the
credit
profiles of players.

"India sends 100 antitrust queries for Reliance, Disney $8.5 bln merger, sources say",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/india-sends-100-antitrust-queries-for-reliance-disney-8-5-bln-merger-sources-say/articleshow/111925663.cms,22-07-2024,"India's antitrust body has asked
Reliance Industries and Walt Disney
around 100 questions linked to their $8.5 billion India media assets merger, including details on sports rights as it heightens its scrutiny of the deal, two sources told Reuters.
Antitrust experts had warned that the
Reliance
and
Disney
deal, which was announced in February, could face intense scrutiny as it will create India's biggest entertainment player with 120 TV channels and two streaming services.
The companies will also together own lucrative rights for cricket, India's most popular sport. In a confidential submission to the Competition Commission of India (
CCI
) in May, the companies said their merger would not hurt the competition, and argued that cricket rights will expire in 2027 and 2028 and allow bidding by rivals, and advertisers can target cricket-watching consumers on many rival platforms including YouTube, Reuters reported in May.
The CCI has now sought more details via two sets of questions, including why YouTube - which mostly has free, user-generated content - should be treated in the same market as subscription streaming services like Netflix and Disney , two sources familiar with the matter said.
Reliance
and Disney have responded to the CCI questions and argued YouTube too has its own licensed, paid content as well as a wide reach, said the sources, who declined to be named as the information is confidential.

Data from Media Partners Asia last year showed that YouTube accounted for 88% of the online video market in India, while the premium video market of 12% is dominated by streaming services which ""curate premium long-form content"".
Reliance-Disney will also own digital and TV cricket rights worth billions of dollars for top cricket tournaments as well as for the Wimbledon tennis championship, which has raised more antitrust concerns.
The CCI has also asked the companies details on which entity owns which sports rights and for how long, as well as information on who had bid for them previously.
""The CCI is so far not raising concerns on the rights but is gathering information,"" said one of the sources.
The requests for so much information could be because of the large size of the deal, said the first source. The second source, however, said the CCI was asking an unusually large number of questions.
Reliance, which is led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and the CCI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Disney declined to comment. The CCI is still reviewing the merger.
If it closes, the Reliance-Disney deal will reshape India's $28 billion entertainment market where
Zee Entertainment
and Sony also operate.
Jefferies estimates Disney-Reliance will command 40% of the advertising market share in the TV and streaming segments.

"Election ad spend helps print media script growth in revenue, profitability",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/election-ad-spend-helps-print-media-script-growth-in-revenue-profitability/articleshow/111909376.cms,22-07-2024,"Mumbai:
Print media
recorded significant revenue and
profitability
growth in the June quarter, driven by increased ad spending during the general elections and lower
newsprint prices
, according to industry experts. Print ad revenue rose 10-11% in H1 of 2024, aided by higher election ad spending, bringing the market size to ₹10,000-11,000 crore, as per industry estimates.
Girish Agarwal, Promoter Director of the
Dainik Bhaskar Newspaper Group
, said: ""Election creates a festive mood, with the election economy boosting spending across the country. Sectors like education, real estate, and jewellery saw a jump in their ad spends in Q1.... Our average cost for newsprint has reduced to ₹46,900 PMT in Q1, resulting in a newsprint cost reduction of 20.9% YoY. This has certainly driven profitability growth for the past couple of quarters.""
Brand managers believe that due to factors like trust, extensive reach, high visibility of newspaper ads, and strong
brand recognition
, print advertising still holds a prominent place in the
media mix
.
Parle Products Senior Category Head Krishnarao Buddha said: ""Print media remains relevant in India for
advertising categories
like auto and gadgets, as brands can provide detailed product information in a print ad that may not be possible on other mediums.""
GroupM South Asia COO Ashwin Padmanabhan said a lot of categories like SMEs, real estate, and consumer packaged goods have made a strong comeback to print. ""Not only is the
ad spend
on print growing, but the way the medium is being used by advertisers has also seen a big shift. Many brands are being creative on print and then amplifying it on social media to spark conversations around their print ads,"" he stated.

"USIBC recommends PLI for media, entertainment industry in upcoming Budget",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/usibc-recommends-pli-for-media-entertainment-industry-in-upcoming-budget/articleshow/111900325.cms,21-07-2024,"A top India-centric American trade body on Sunday recommended that the Indian government should introduce production-linked incentives for the
media and entertainment industry
in the upcoming
Budget
. The trade body also called for steps to level the playing field between Indian and foreign companies.
Ahead of the annual Budget presentation by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23, the
US India Business Council
(
USIBC
) pitched for liberalising the
satellite communications industry
and taking measures to create a level playing field for Indian and foreign
financial services
firms and reduce friction in the flow of capital between the two countries.
Proposing eliminating value restrictions on courier exports exceeding Rs 5 lakh to streamline processes and foster greater efficiency, USIBC, in its memorandum to the Union Finance Ministry, suggested removing restrictions on perishable goods shipped via courier to ensure swift clearance, supporting perishable trade dynamics and integrating a single window system for courier shipments to enhance operational ease and reduce bureaucratic hurdles.
""Firstly, we propose to issue a clarification regarding Input Tax Credits (ITC) under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on payment to expatriate employees. Secondly, we recommend that the concerned authority may issue appropriate clarification on eligibility of ITC on medical insurance to employees.

""Thirdly, we suggest issuing an appropriate interpretation clarifying taxability (GST) of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)/Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) provided by a company to its employees through its overseas holding company,"" it said.
USIBC also recommended providing an exemption via tax collected at source (TCS) for the ESOP and other similar employee benefit schemes where remittances are made through the employer. These measures are expected to foster policy certainty and ensure consistent practice of rules/laws by different authorities.
For the telecommunications sector, USIBC suggested liberalising the satellite communications industry and developing a long-term transition plan to commercialise India's Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) and enable space platforms and infrastructure.
""While benefiting all digital manufacturers, our semiconductor members have emphasised several ease-of-doing-business policies (EoDB) policies. USIBC recommends that the Indian government introduce production-linked incentives for the media and entertainment industry in the upcoming Budget,"" the trade body said.

Given the global demand for content and India's competitive production costs, these incentives would position India as a leading hub for content production exports.
The adoption of advanced technologies such as visual and special effects (VFX), 3D/4D formats, drone shooting, and animation could be further supported by these incentives, similar to those in the information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITeS) industry, enhancing India's attractiveness for international media production.
USIBC also urged the Indian government to promote the sustainable growth of the
energy sector
by upholding free-market principles, which will attract investments and enhance energy security.
For downstream fuels, the development of an independent entity to manage pipeline infrastructure is suggested, ensuring non-discriminatory access and transparent tariffs.

A streamlined approval process for fuel retail outlets, inclusion of remote areas on highways and reconsideration of differential excise duties on unblended fuels are also advised.
Additionally, USIBC also suggested waivers of interstate transmission charges for offshore wind projects, sunset clauses for cross-subsidy surcharges, and non-tender-based offshore wind project awards.
On the financial services front, the trade body pitched for tax parity between foreign bank branches and India-domiciled banks, removing the limitations on dividends and the cap on related party payments applicable only to majority foreign-owned insurance intermediaries and ease the 'FDI safeguards' that dissuade foreign insurance companies from raising their stakes in their Indian insurance joint venture companies.
In addition, it called for facilitating the direct listing of shares of Indian companies on offshore stock exchanges, reinstituting the concessional 5 per cent withholding tax rate on external commercial borrowings and foreign portfolio investment in the rupee-denominated debt and streamlining the delisting process to facilitate take-private transactions could substantially enhance capital flows between India and the US.
USIBC recommended a balanced intellectual property rights (IPR) policy to facilitate technology transfer and bolster FDI, enhancing the effectiveness of schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme.
The trade body also called for customs duty exemptions on lifesaving medicines to ensure affordability and accessibility for patients. These measures aim to streamline regulatory frameworks, encourage investment, and support sustainable growth in India's life sciences sector.

Sponsorships span the gamut of deliverables, from logo display on official uniforms as with JSW, to equipping athletes with gear or kits, such as Puma.
“We are swamped by queries from brands looking to soft-block medal probables, since the athletes are not available (now) or are in training,” said Rahul Trehan, chief operating officer at talent management agency IOS Sports and Entertainment, which is handling marketing for IOA. “We haven’t seen this sort of eagerness by Indian brands for non-cricket sports and it’s very encouraging.”
Global Olympic sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Omega and Samsung are also doing India-specific deals.
In the Game
Athletes such as Neeraj Chopra, Manika Batra, Rohan Bopanna, PV Sindhu, Lovlina Borgohain and Mirabai Chanu have remained consistently visible in terms of brand association, unlike the past, when they were seen only during competition time, said industry executives.
Tokyo javelin gold medallist Chopra, for instance, has been at the forefront of brand deals, one of the biggest and newest being Swiss luxury watch maker Omega. “India is a top 10 market for Omega and we are very focused here,” said Raynald Aeschlimann, president and chief executive of Omega, which is the official timekeeper for the Paris Olympics.
In Paris, there are also new tie-ups such as ‘spirits partner’ and ‘ceremonial kits partner.’
Celebrated designer Tarun Tahiliani has worked on the ceremonial dress for the Indian team under Aditya Birla Group label Tasva — the first time a high-profile name has associated in this way. Tahiliani joins the likes of Christian Louboutin, Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren, who have designed uniforms for Olympic athletes.
Representatives of the athletes said queries from brands seeking tactical or long-term campaigns have surged from two or three per top name before Tokyo, to at least a dozen now.
Executives said they expect the sport stars to exceed India’s highest Olympic medal haul of seven in Tokyo. “We are confident our athletes will do better than the previous Olympics,” said Jayen Mehta, managing director of dairy major Amul, one of the event sponsors. “Apart from the sponsorship, we plan to establish a grassroot connect with athletes, since many of the top performers come from smaller towns.”
Big Scores
An executive at a media buying company said the fee charged by the athletes for endorsements has doubled since Tokyo. “Rates for short video reels have surged to Rs 2-6 lakh, depending on the athletes,” he said.
Puma will provide over 40 Indian athletes with footwear and accessories and has roped in badminton player PV Sindhu, hockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh and javelin thrower Kishore Jena, said Karthik Balagopalan, managing director of the India unit of German sports footwear and apparel maker, which is the team’s official footwear partner for the Paris Olympics.
Reliance Foundation has signed sports tech company Dream Sports as principal partner for India House. Dream Sports’ portfolio of brands such as Dream11, FanCode and DreamSetGo, will be involved with the Olympics at different stages. “We aim to make premium sporting events and experiences more accessible, and this association allows us to bring the multi-sport event to the Indian market,” said Monish Shah, founder of DreamSetGo.
The event will be the third Olympics that JSW is involved with, said Prashant Rao, executive vice-president, brand, at the group.
Aditya Birla Capital, said in a press note that the official sponsor of Team India is showing support through marketing campaigns across print, digital, OTT platforms, outdoor and social media. The financial services company plans to showcase the athletes’ individual stories of struggle and how they overcame them. ""We are excited to partner with the IOA,"" Vishakha Mulye, chief executive said.
The Paris Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 26 to August 11. India’s team has 117 members.

According to
Media Partners Asia
, Netflix had 12 million paid subscribers in India. As per regulatory filings, Netflix Entertainment Services India reported a 24% growth in revenue at Rs 2,214 crore in FY23. Net profit jumped 75% to Rs 35 crore during the year.
“It's truly remarkable how our series and films have made a significant impact on a global scale. Heeramandi becoming our biggest Indian drama series to date is a testament to this. We are focused on engagement as the single most important indicator of success because when our members watch more, they stick around longer,"" said Netflix India vice president incharge of content Monika Shergill.
She noted that 2024 has been a great year for Netflix, with healthy engagement across films and series as well as a steady growth in subscribers.
Speaking at the MoffettNathanson Media, Internet & Communications conference in May, Netflix VP of finance, corporate development, and investor relations Spencer Wang noted that the platform is growing quickly in India.
Wang also said that India is an important country for Netflix and a very competitive one. While noting that Indian consumers have a lot of choice, Spencer said the platform's job is to just improve its offerings so that they resonate with the Indian consumer.
‘The Great Indian Kapil Show’ and ‘Heeramandi’ were among the popular titles, creating 1.1 billion organic impressions on Netflix India's social channels.
Netflix India had earlier announced it would release 14 shows and eight films in 2024. The platform has lined up non-fiction content including ‘Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli’, ‘Nayanthara: Beyond the Fairy Tale’, and ‘Yo Yo Honey Singh’.
Films and series on the platform include returning seasons of ‘Yeh Kaali Kaali Ankhein’, ‘The Great Indian Kapil Show’, ‘Fabulous Lives Vs.

CVC taps Gujarat's Titans for IPL sale; Adani & Torrent get another shot at buying team,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/cvc-taps-gujarats-titans-for-ipl-sale-adani-torrent-get-another-shot-at-buying-team/articleshow/111845028.cms,19-07-2024,"Mumbai: Private equity firm
CVC Capital Partners
is in talks with
Adani Group
and
Torrent Group
to sell a controlling stake in Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise,
Gujarat Titans
, people with knowledge of the development told ET.
CVC is willing to offload a majority stake in the
IPL franchise
while retaining a minority holding, one of the persons said.
Board of Control for Cricket in India's (
BCCI
's) lock-in period that prevents new teams from selling a stake will end in February 2025.
People said the three-year-old franchise could be valued at between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. CVC had bought the franchise in 2021 for ₹5,625 crore ($745 million at the then-exchange rate).
Live Events
US investment bank Houlihan Lokey has valued IPL at $16.4 billion thanks to a record-breaking $6 billion
media rights deal
.
Attracting Investor Attention
BCCI signed the media rights deal with Disney Star and Viacom18 in 2022. ""Having missed out on the opportunity to own IPL's Ahmedabad franchise in 2021, both Adani and Torrent are vying aggressively to buy a majority stake in Gujarat Titans. For CVC, it's a great opportunity to monetise its stake in the franchise,"" said an official in the know. Both Adani and Torrent are based in Ahmedabad, while CVC Capital is headquartered in Luxembourg.
Adani, Torrent, and CVC declined to comment.
""IPL franchises have been attracting a lot of investor attention since the league has established itself as an attractive asset with solid cash flows,"" a second official said.
Unlike Torrent, Adani has already made investments in cricket by acquiring teams in the Women's Premier League (WPL) and UAE-based International League T20. In 2023, Adani bagged WPL's Ahmedabad franchise with a top bid of ₹1,289 crore.
With ₹193 billion of assets under management, CVC is a big backer of sports with investments in LaLiga, Premiership Rugby, Volleyball World, and Women's Tennis Association.
In 2021, BCCI floated tenders to add two more city-based teams to the cash-rich IPL. Ahmedabad was one of the most hotly contested cities, with Adani Group placing a bid of ₹5,100 crore and Torrent Group bidding ₹4,653 crore.
CVC Capital-owned Irelia Sports India trumped other bidders to bag the Ahmedabad franchise. Gujarat Titans won the IPL title in its very first season, giving the brand a major boost.
For the fiscal year ended March 2023, Irelia Sports reported a net loss of ₹429 crore on revenue of ₹359 crore. The company's expenditure stood at ₹789 crore.
In an earlier interaction with ET, Gujarat Titans COO Arvinder Singh said the franchise will ""attain profitability in the next media rights cycle"".
The current media rights cycle ends in 2027. ""Even the original ten franchisees took four to five years before they turned profitable. We are confident that not only will we turn profitable, but our brand value will also increase exponentially,"" he had stated.
According to Houlihan Lokey, Gujarat Titans had a brand value of $124 million and were in the eighth position in the pecking order.
With a brand value of $231 million, Chennai Super Kings topped the list.

FIFA asks for Club World Cup broadcast bids just 11 months before 32-team event launches in US,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/fifa-asks-for-club-world-cup-broadcast-bids-just-11-months-before-32-team-event-launches-in-us/articleshow/111771112.cms,16-07-2024,"Just 11 months before the inaugural 32-team
Club World Cup
in men's soccer, FIFA invited bids for rights to broadcast the 63-game tournament to be staged in the
United States
. FIFA on Monday published an ""invitation to tender in the Americas, Asia, and Middle East and North Africa"" weeks after talks with tech giant
Apple
over an exclusive global rights deal reportedly hit trouble.
FIFA said a second phase of rights sales for the 2025 and 2029 Club World Cups will follow in Europe. Soccer's wealthiest and strongest continent will send 12 teams including key attractions Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich to the revamped tournament scheduled next June 15 to July 13.
A relaunched and lucrative Club World Cup has been coveted by FIFA President Gianni Infantino since he was elected in 2016, with aims to pay participating teams tens of millions of dollars in prize money.
However, the value of a potential Apple deal was seen as an issue for the influential
European Club Association
(ECA) led by Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of Paris Saint-Germain which is also in the Club World Club lineup.

IOC and Saudi Arabia agree on 12-year deal for video gaming Esports Olympics
FIFA said on Monday it would involve the ECA in ""an innovative, progressive style of consultation and decision-making"" about the tournament.
The ECA already has a big say in commercial decisions for the Champions League through a joint venture with competition organizer UEFA.
It is unclear what kind of broadcast model FIFA now favours, or if it will rely on its in-house streaming service FIFA+ in some markets.
Entries to the Club World Cup are earned by title wins and consistently good results in continental championships from 2020-24, and just three are left to be decided: Two from South America and one from the host league, Major League Soccer.

The Club World Cup will become a month-long tournament played every four years in June-July. For nearly two decades it has been played each December as a small-scale annual event for continental champions. Europe's champion has won 16 of the past 17 titles.
The FIFA club tournament also will be a rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup in men's soccer in some of the same stadiums in the U.S., which is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico.
FIFA has yet to announce which cities will host games in the revamped Club World Cup nor any separate sponsor deals, though funding is expected from Saudi Arabia. The annual version was previously packaged up with World Cup deals.
Amid concerns at overloaded schedules for top-tier players, the first 32-team Club World Cup will see the finalists play seven games at the end of a season in which the Champions League in Europe also is expanding with more teams and more games in a new format.

TV channels told to seek IN-SPACe nod before using foreign satellite capacity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tv-channels-told-to-seek-in-space-nod-before-using-foreign-satellite-capacity/articleshow/111697297.cms,12-07-2024,"Mumbai: The ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) has directed
satellite TV
channels and teleport operators to seek government-backed Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre's (
IN-SPACe

foreign satellite
capacity for providing broadcasting services.
In an advisory dated July 10, the MIB stated that the existing arrangements for provisioning of capacity in C, Ku or Ka frequency bands from foreign satellite operators can be extended till March 31, 2025.
""Effective from 01.04.2025 only IN-SPACe authorised non-Indian GSO satellites and/or NGSO satellite constellations are permitted for provisioning their capacity to provide space based communication/ broadcast services in India,"" the advisory reads.
The ministry also stated that applications for authorisation must be submitted through IN-SPACe website by an Indian entity, which could be an Indian subsidiary, joint venture/collaboration, or an authorised dealer/representative of the foreign satellite operator in India.
Currently, NewSpace India, a public sector undertaking under Department of Space, leases transponder capacity in C, Ku and extended C band from both Indian and foreign satellites.

According to the Department of Space, 18 communication satellites were operating over India with communication transponders in C-band, Extended C-band, Ku-band, Ka/Ku band, and S-band, as of March 2023.
About 70 transponders in Ku-Band and HTS capacity of 1.6 GHz were leased from international satellite operators while an additional 40 transponders in C-band were directly leased by the broadcasters for TV uplinking.

Broadcasters may move court against Trai ruling on pay channels,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/broadcasters-may-move-court-against-trai-ruling-on-pay-channels/articleshow/111642519.cms,11-07-2024,"Mumbai:
TV broadcasters
are planning to mount a legal challenge to the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
's (Trai) directive on making
pay channels
that are available on
DD Free Dish
free to other distributors, sources privy to the development said.
The
broadcasters
are likely to move court against the Trai notification through industry bodies like Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation and News Broadcasters and Digital Association, they added.
Trai had on Monday directed that a TV channel permitted by the
ministry of information
and broadcasting (MIB), which is available for free on DD Free Dish platform, cannot be declared a pay channel for addressable distribution platforms.
A senior TV broadcast executive said the broadcasters have a strong case against Trai since the regulator doesn't have jurisdiction over DD Free Dish, which is a free direct-to-home (DTH) platform owned by Prasar Bharati.

""Broadcasters don't charge subscription fees from DD Free Dish since it doesn't charge any subscription fee from customers, whereas pay DTH and cable platforms charge customers for all the pay channels that they offer,"" the executive said, adding that the pay distribution platforms charge network capacity fees from customers whereas DD Free Dish doesn't.
However, a cable TV executive said Trai's direction is to broadcasters and not to DD Free Dish; therefore, the regulator is well within its right to issue this directive. ""A channel should be paid or FTA (free-to-air) uniformly across all platforms, including DD Free Dish,"" he said.
Currently, over 15 pay channels across news and entertainment genres are present on DD Free Dish. However, the entertainment channels have a nominal price as they air old content.
A distribution executive said some of these entertainment channels have been kept paid since Trai regulations prohibit bundling of free and paid channels. Both cable and DTH platforms have been lobbying with MIB and Trai to bring DD Free Dish under the
regulatory framework
to ensure a level playing field. Trai has also recommended to MIB that DD Free Dish be upgraded to an encrypted platform in a phased manner. Currently, the majority of DD Free Dish customers use MPEG-2 set top boxes, which are unencrypted.
A few years ago, Prasar Bharati started offering encrypted MPEG-4 set top boxes through authorised vendors but these set-top boxes didn't see much uptake.
Pay-TV platforms, which collectively service over 100 million homes, have been losing customers that are at the lower end of the spectrum to DD Free Dish, which offers over 100 TV channels.
As per industry estimates, DD Free Dish reaches 40-50 million homes and is already the single largest
TV distribution platform
in the country. Its user base mostly resides in rural areas of northern and eastern Indian states.

Badtime stories: Users wary of cognitive dissonance and emotional turmoil Instagram Stories put them through,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/badtime-stories-users-wary-of-cognitive-dissonance-and-emotional-turmoil-instagram-stories-put-them-through/articleshow/111623656.cms,10-07-2024,"“POV: You’re watching Stories of that one friend at Cannes Lions.”
Late last month, Palak Kapadia, a 28-year-old copywriter from New York, US, posted a reel on Instagram with this caption. The 18-second video offers a montage of her experiences at the week-long
advertising festival
.
It begins with Kapadia having a serious conversation about women in advertising at a talent program inside the Palais, followed by a clip of her dancing at a Cannes party, attending awards night, speaker sessions, and finally, walking down the hallowed stairs of the Debussy.
Kapadia’s reel is part of a current trend on Instagram where users stitch myriad clips from their daily lives in a short video to convey a contrasting “vibe change”, leaving viewers with the impression that they “can’t pick a personality”. She thinks the trend is a representation of our chaotic lives. On an otherwise curated feed, “seeing these Stories makes it feel more like a conversation you’re having with a friend that can meander in a million different directions. There’s a certain
authenticity
to that lack of forced consistency in tone,” she explains.
Lost in transition
However, the trend is also indicative of the growing
cognitive dissonance
users have with
Instagram Stories
— a feature that enjoys prime real estate right at the top of the app’s home screen.
Abrupt and jarring transitions between these seven-to-15-second clips, which may often present conflicting emotions from one update to the next, are making users feel increasingly disconnected from the people whose Stories they follow, at times even numbing them to the issues portrayed in these posts.
Live Events
“One moment, you see them posting about a funeral; the next, there’s a meme; followed by a picture of food. It leaves you wondering, how can their mood change so drastically in just 30 seconds?” wonders Vikramjit Singh, a Delhi-based stand-up comedian and former adman.
“One Insta Story shows protesting wrestlers being dragged. The very next: ‘Tim Hortons! Best coffee with bestie.’ ""Existing in parallel worlds is one big curse of
social media
,” he had posted on X (then Twitter) in May 2023.
While social media as a whole is prone to evoking disparate emotions, Stories tend to elicit these in under a minute. This makes the person, rather than the feed, the source of
emotional inconsistency
for the e-onlooker.
Moreover, one tends to follow Stories of people who are part of their inner world, unlike posts and updates appearing on the grid. Their emotional potpourri often has a rub-off effect on the viewer, Singh notes, and this can be overwhelming. “So, the jarring contrast between their various Stories forces you to develop a sense of detachment from their routine updates, turning what should be personal into somewhat impersonal,” he adds.
A changing world
In 2016, when Instagram launched Stories — a version of Snapchat’s offering with the same name — it was a gentler, kinder world. So, having “Stories [that] allow you to share everyday moments and grow closer to the people and interests you care about” — as Instagram describes the feature on its ‘About’ page — probably seemed harmless.
However, over the past three to four years, as the world witnessed a pandemic and wars occurring simultaneously, a slideshow format featuring clips on various topics may have prompted the opposite effect.
By contrast, on platforms like X and LinkedIn, says Mona Gandhi, founder of Upraised, an upskilling platform for tech product managers, “the emotional spikes are subtle due to the longer time it takes to express and consume content”.
On visual platforms like Instagram, particularly with Stories, “these swings are rather rapid”.
Gandhi recently shared her thoughts on X about the discomfort of seeing people sharing photos of European summer travels on their Insta Stories alongside updates from war-hit regions like Rafah. She believes Stories are to blame for desensitising us to many issues of public interest. “With the endless scroll, you don’t have to do anything. Things just keep showing up. I don’t think we have the emotional quotient required to handle this range.”
Essentially, “everything we put out is communication, urging a response”, says Medha Gupta, a clinical psychologist from Hyderabad. “With Stories, we now have the option to scoot over [something] rather than staying with a feeling and processing it.”
Gupta is concerned that this leads to the opposite of compassion fatigue. “Compassion comes from staying with suffering long enough to feel fatigue. Stories don’t allow this — they prevent people from staying with a feeling long enough to act on it or to be able to experience fatigue,” she adds.
Instagram did not respond to an email for comments on the story.
Who gets to post?
In May, actor Alia Bhatt was added to ‘Blockout 2024’, a global list of celebrities boycotted on social media for their “non-committal stance” on Israel’s attacks on civilians in Palestine. Shortly after, Bhatt joined 40 million-plus users in sharing the ‘All Eyes on Rafah’ template on Instagram Stories, something which was already criticised for using an AI-generated image instead of real photos from the ground.
But some users also had a problem with the fact that it was a celebrity like Bhatt who posted this. “It felt authentic when people who had been sharing posts about Gaza used that template,” says Priyal Sanghvi, a Mumbai-based marketing professional. “The dissonance is clear when one story features a lavish designer outfit and the next, a Rafah template.” Sanghvi, who lost relatives during Covid, noticed similar tone-deafness even back then. “People sharing Faye D’Souza’s Covid story and following it up with their holiday party stories on Insta,” she had posted on X in January 2022.
However, the dissonance was less pronounced back then, because the pandemic affected almost everyone personally, she feels. “When issues don’t affect you directly or when you’ve never spoken about the topic earlier, the dissonance is more evident,” she believes.
People may also feel obligated to address certain topics, she says. “Some post for relevance on slow-content days. For regular people, it’s just filling gaps in their Instagram Story feeds,” she adds.
What do brands feel?
With so many users feeling conflicted about the way Stories are used and shown, where do brands stand? Are they rethinking how to leverage Stories as an advertising vehicle?
Brands have always requested that creators limit the number of stories they post when their sponsored content is released, says Pankhuri Harikrishnan, founder and director, Fetch Consulting, an influencer marketing agency. “They cannot specify the exact number of stories the creator should ideally post, but they do ask for them not to put too many, emphasising that a series of multiple stories, indicated by a dotted line, is best avoided,” she reveals.
“Some stories are deleted midway once they have served their purpose. Additionally, some brands only pay for Stories, bypassing feed posts, as it suits their budget and performs well for them,” she adds.
So, it all boils down to the fact that Stories “work well for brands”, says Nikita Abhanave, a digital media and marketing specialist. “They are consumed faster than any other mobile format, and they take up the full mobile screen, creating an immersive space for brands,” she says.
Abhanave highlights that Stories boost ad placement by supporting swipe-up links with calls to-action (CTA). “Elements like animation, stickers and trending sounds allow advertisers to be more creative with their promotional content on Stories,” she adds.
Ads on Instagram Stories made up 26.7% of the platform’s ad revenue in 2023, according to a WARC Media report. Marketers rarely control the
personal content
creators post before and after their branded stories, unless it has a direct connect with a rival brand. “Addressing the dissonance of Instagram Stories requires empathy, but marketers tend to prioritise return on investment (RoI) instead,” Abhanave adds.
Suyash Saraf, co-founder of beauty brand Dot & Key, says, “We like to be the first Instagram Story of the day for the creator we are collaborating with, so that the communication resonates better.”
Saraf admits that there’s room for another ask from creators, too: Maybe avoid posting content that’s too jarring that day. “We are a beauty brand and hence, want to evoke a happy emotion in the viewer when they see our communication. We don’t want them to go through a spike of emotions characteristic of Instagram Stories these days,” he adds.
Are we ‘like’ done here?
X’s removal of likes is a sign of their declining power as social media currency. Anushka Kulkarni expresses disappointment over X's decision to hide the ""Likes"" tab, which she and others used to subtly vet potential romantic interests. She laments the loss of authenticity and charm in likes, questioning whether likes are now being used as private bookmarks or manipulated by bots.
The trend of hiding likes has been seen across social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube, prompting varied reactions among users and raising concerns about privacy and social dynamics online.

TRAI offers relief to TV distribution platforms in amended tariff order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/trai-notifies-amendments-on-broadcasting-cable-services-to-allow-45-discount-removes-price-caps-on-several-channels/articleshow/111584128.cms,08-07-2024,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
TRAI
) has issued tariff orders and interconnection regulations to reduce the regulatory burden on distribution platform operators (DPOs) amidst the migration of pay-TV customers to other platforms.
The regulator has lifted the cap on network capacity fee (NCF) and brought it under forbearance to allow DPOs the ability to charge customers based on their paying capacity. Earlier, the cap on NCF was Rs 130 for 200 channels and Rs 160 for over 200 channels.
A cable TV company's top executive argued that an NCF forbearance would enable DPOs to charge more NCF from high-end consumers while charging less from low-income customers.
The new tariff order (NTO) regime requires TV consumers to pay subscription fees for TV channels to broadcasters and NCF, also called an infrastructure fee, to DPOs like Tata Play,
Dish TV
,
Hathway
, and DEN.
The regulator has also mandated that free-to-air (FTA) channels on Prasar Bharati-owned DD Free Dish will also be free on DPOs that charge subscription fees.

Broadcasters previously offered certain pay channels on DD Free Dish for free to expand their audience, while charging subscription fees for the same channels from pay DPOs.
The TRAI has also brought DPOs on par with broadcasters by allowing them to offer a 45% discount on a-la-carte channels while creating bouquets for customers.
A senior executive from a leading media firm stated that despite the TRAI's enabling provision, DPOs are hardly in a position to offer a 45% discount on a la carte channels.
The existing regulatory framework permits broadcasters to provide a 45% discount on a la carte channels while limiting the discount on bouquets to 15%.
The regulator has also hiked the monthly carriage fee per channel to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 4 lakh while removing the distinction between standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) channels.
Previously, the monthly carriage fee for an SD channel was Rs 4 lakh, while that for an HD channel was Rs 8 lakh.
In order to allow DPOs to arrange channels based on language and genre, the TRAI, in separate recommendations to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), stated that the latter should gather information from broadcasters about the primary language and sub-genre of channels before granting permission.
It also suggested that the MIB should upgrade DD Free Dish in a phased manner to an addressable system within a specified timeframe to prevent piracy and maintain subscriber records.

NBDA brings digital news under its self-regulatory body's purview,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/nbda-brings-digital-news-under-its-self-regulatory-bodys-purview/articleshow/111348983.cms,28-06-2024,"The
News Broadcasters
& Digital Association (
NBDA
), the apex body of news
broadcasters
in India, has brought
digital news
media under the purview of its
self-regulatory body
, the News Broadcasting & Digital Standards Authority (
NBDSA
).
The move comes after the NBDA decided to admit digital news media as members. NBDA members include some of the nation's top-rated news channels, and they command more than 80% of news television viewership in India.
The NBDA has also stated that the NBDSA
regulation
covers digital news media, digital news platforms,
OTT platforms
, and
digital publishers
.
The regulation defines digital news media as digitised news content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks and includes content received, stored, transmitted, edited, or processed by a digital publisher.
Digital news platforms have been defined as platforms that facilitate the transmission of digitised news content over the internet or computer networks, including social networking sites or social media.
Live Events
It defines OTT platforms as the ones that facilitate the transmission of any programme, feature, news item, newseport, or any other matter over the internet or computer networks on demand.
The regulation states that digital publishers include a news portal, news aggregator, news agency, and any other entity engaged in the publishing of news and current affairs content on digital news platforms, OTT platforms, social networking sites, and social media.
The NBDSA, which was founded almost 15 years ago, has evolved into the default redressal method and mechanism for viewers. It is headed by eminent former judges of the Supreme Court of India and by other renowned independent members.
The NBDA has also broadened the penalties that will be imposed on TV and digital news publishers for violations of the
code of conduct
.
Besides warnings, admonishments, censures, and apologies, the NBDSA may also impose fines up to Rs. 2 lakhs, Rs. 5 lakhs, and up to 1% of the channel's annual turnover, provided the fine doesn't exceed Rs. 25 lakhs, for each subsequent violation.
The NBDSA can also suspend a programme for up to one week or recommend suspension or revocation of a broadcaster's license. It might also ask the broadcast to suspend an anchor for up to a month.
It may impose immediate removal or editing of broadcasts or publications from digital news platforms, social media, and social networking sites if they violate the regulations.
According to the NBDSA, the NBDSA may exercise suo motu power in cases where the public interest requires immediate remedial action to be taken or in other cases where the authority deems it fit to do so.
In emergency situations involving egregious or repetitive violations of the Code of Conduct by member broadcasters or digital publishers, the Authority has the power to issue interim directions without following procedures in the regulations.
In such emergency situations, an urgent meeting of the authority will be convened within 24 hours of such a violation of the code of conduct being brought to its attention.
After the passing of any such interim directions, the aggrieved broadcaster or digital publisher may approach the authority for redressal of its grievance immediately, the NBDA said.
If a suitable explanation is given by the broadcasters or digital publishers, the authority can set aside the interim directions and direct the programme or content to be restored, it added.

66% of Indian consumers prefer to pay less in exchange for watching ads: Survey,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/66-of-indian-consumers-prefer-to-pay-less-in-exchange-for-watching-ads-survey/articleshow/111335541.cms,28-06-2024,"A survey by ad-tech company Moloco and research firm YouGov indicates that 66% of Indian consumers prefer to pay less in exchange for watching ads.
Further, the survey states that 34% of Indian consumers are cutting the cord with traditional
TV
services, while 27% are considering it but haven't yet done so.
The survey, titled Consumer Perceptions of Ads on Streamers Survey 2024, was conducted online in India by YouGov and focused on consumers who watch video content at least once a month, including streaming content. 1,005 respondents participated in the 10-minute online survey from January 19, 2024, to February 5, 2024.
“It’s important to get the ad experience right because consumers will cancel a subscription based on the ad experience. This research is a wake-up call for many streaming media platforms to transform their approach to building an ad business,” said Dave Simon, General Manager, Growth Initiatives, Moloco.
“Consumers have a strong appetite for relevant,
personalised ads
that enhance the viewing experience. These ads are influencing their behaviour and decision-making process. These combined trends signal the need for a more personalised approach to
advertising
on streamers, driven by leveraging advanced machine learning at scale.”

“Indian consumers do not mind watching that extra ad that can lower or entirely remove the subscription fee to watch content—this insight got validated when this survey showed that two-thirds of Indian consumers chose lower fees in exchange for watching ads. What’s even more interesting is that approximately . 80% of customers prefer personalised ads, which significantly influence their decision-making process.” Siddharth Jhawar, General Manager, Moloco India,.
According to the survey, people are moving away from traditional TV and towards streaming media platforms, particularly on mobile devices.
60% of Indian consumers report that a mobile phone is the device most commonly used for personal streaming, compared with 26% for smart TVs, 11% for laptops and PCs, and 3% for tablets.
The survey also revealed that 44% of consumers prefer interesting and relevant ads to enhance their viewing experience. Further, 41% of consumers have cancelled a subscription specifically because of the ad experience.
Pre- and post-roll ads are ranked most acceptable compared with mid-roll and banner or display ads, while banner or display ads and mid-roll ads are perceived as the most intrusive or disruptive.
Ads on
streaming platforms
are influential in the decision-making process for product or service purchases, with 83% reporting some level of influence, the survey notes.
“The ad experience is clearly important, especially with consumers not just adjusting to ads on streaming media platforms but embracing ads,” said Vanessa Khoo, Senior Research Manager, YouGov.
“In addition, this research showed that consumers find ads compelling and influential in their overall decision-making process for product purchases. This study also showed that personalised ads can actually enhance the overall viewing experience.”

"Broadcasters cannot transfer operations of TV channels to third party, warns MIB",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/broadcasters-cannot-transfer-operations-of-tv-channels-to-third-party-warns-mib/articleshow/111264700.cms,25-06-2024,"The
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
(
MIB
) has warned the
broadcasters
that transferring the
core operations
of a TV channel to a
third party
, including group entities, without prior
permission
is a violation of
policy guidelines
and will result in the cancellation of the
licence
.
The MIB, which is the licencing authority for
TV channels
, said that Clause 26(2) of 'Guidelines for Uplinking and Downlinking of Satellite Television Channels in India, 2022' bars permission holders from contracting the core operations of a TV channel like content generation, content transfer, and content uplink to a third party.
In an
advisory
on Tuesday, the ministry directed all permitted broadcasters to follow the policy guidelines in letter and spirit by ensuring that the operations and core functions of the channel are managed by the permission holder only.
""Therefore, it is hereby clarified that the letting of the channels to any third party, including the group entities, without the prior permission of the ministry is not allowed as per the existing policy guidelines,"" the MIB advisory reads.
While noting that the security clearance by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is one of the pre-requisite conditions for receiving a TV channel licence, the ministry said that the broadcasters must ensure that individuals who are not security cleared by MHA should not be involved in the running of a TV channel.

Net loss from the broadband business narrowed 13% to Rs 108 crore, while revenue grew 27% to Rs 329 crore.
Tata Play declined to comment on the financials.
In a recent report on Tata Play, ratings firm
Crisil
stated that the company's revenue from the core DTH business was predicted to decrease in the medium term due to moderation in its subscriber base.
The decline is likely to be offset by growth in broadband and over-the-top (OTT) businesses, it added.
The DTH subscriber base has been under severe stress due to competition from DD Free Dish and OTT platforms.
According to a
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
report, the four paid DTH platforms, including Tata Play, had 63.52 million active subscribers as of December 2023.
Tata Play was the largest platform, with 32.71% of the paid DTH market, which translates to 20.77 million subscribers.
Tata Play Broadband, which provides service under the Tata Play Fibre brand, has 0.48 million subscribers.
Recently, Temasek-owned Baytree Investments Mauritius sold its 10% stake in Tata Play to
Tata Sons
for $100 million.
Walt Disney
is also looking to exit the company by selling its 30% stake.
During the fiscal year, the DTH operator paid Rs 965 crore to
Star India
as the broadcaster’s share of maximum retail price net of broadcast incentive. Star India is owned by Walt Disney.

NCLT allows Zee to withdraw its merger implementation application,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/nclt-allows-zee-to-withdraw-its-merger-implementation-application/articleshow/111222793.cms,24-06-2024,"The National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) has allowed
ZEE
Entertainment Enterprises Limited (
ZEEL
) to withdraw its implementation application that sought directions to
Sony
Group Corp-owned Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment to implement the composite scheme of arrangement between the three companies.
ZEEL had filed the implementation application after Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment terminated the merger agreement on January 22 over an alleged breach of the merger cooperation agreement (MCA). Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment had also filed applications in NCLT challenging the validity of ZEEL's application.
Sony and Zee signed definitive agreements to merge their businesses on December 21, 2021. The termination had put an end to the multi-billion-dollar mega-merger deal that had been in the making for over two years.
In April, ZEEL said that the withdrawal of the merger implementation application will allow it to pursue its claims against Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and other forums.
The company also said that the decision will allow it to pursue growth and evaluate strategic opportunities to generate higher value for all shareholders.

While terminating the merger agreement, Sony's India entities had initiated arbitration proceedings against ZEEL before SIAC and had sought $90 million in termination fees from the Indian entertainment major for alleged breaches of the MCA.
Sony's decision to call off the deal on January 22 set a chain reaction, with ZEEL's stock price crashing down 33% to a 52-week low of Rs 152.5 on January 23, compelling the company to take drastic measures to return to the growth path after four years of declining profits and muted revenue growth.
""The immediate priority for the company is to focus on performance and achieve its targeted goals for the future. We have reviewed the key steps taken by the management over the last few months that are result-oriented, and we believe that the company is well poised to chart a stronger growth trajectory,"" said ZEEL chairman R. Gopalan.
""Hence, after seeking an independent legal opinion, the Board has advised the management of the company to withdraw the implementation application filed before the Hon’ble NCLT. The Board remains focused on maximising shareholder value, strengthening the company’s claims in arbitration, and enabling the company to explore strategic opportunities.”
ZEEL has been on an aggressive cost-cutting spree to achieve its target of 18–20% EBITDA margin by FY26. The company has decided to lay off 15% of its 4,500 staff.

ICC T20 Men's World Cup
2024 has seen an 8% drop in
TV ratings
for the first 30 matches compared to the 2022 edition of the event due to a drop in time spent, even as cumulative audience reach has gone up by 4% to 205 million.
As per
Broadcast Audience Research Council
(BARC) data, the average ratings for the T20 World Cup have dropped 8% to 0.97 TVR for all India male and female 2+ audiences and 13% to 1.2 TVR for all India male 15+ audiences. TVR or TV rating is a combination of time spent and reach.
The June 9 match between arch-rivals India and Pakistan garnered 3.89 TVR and 4.81 TVR for All India MF 2+ and M 15+ audiences, respectively. Experts point out that the Indo-Pak game's TV rating is among the lowest for the matches between the two arch-rivals since 2019.
While the cumulative reach for 2+ audiences has gone up, it has declined 2% to 86 million for male 15+ audiences. Advertisers target males aged 15+ as they are the core cricket audience base.
As per
BARC data
, the average free commercial time (FCT) consumption across the Disney Star network is upwards of 1300 seconds. On Star Sports 1 Hindi, which is one of the key channels of monetisation, the average FCT per match is over 1,400 seconds.

A total of 51 advertisers are advertising during the tournament.
Media buyers say that the broadcaster has so far raked in
ad revenue
worth Rs 900–1,000 crore across TV and digital.
""The T20 World Cup got impacted due to the IPL and general elections. The T20 World Cup is happening after the IPL, which sucked out a lot of money from the market,"" said the CEO of a media buying agency, on condition of anonymity.
EssenceMediacom South Asia CEO Navin Khemka said the TV ratings for the tournament have taken a hit due to the unfavourable timing of most of the matches, barring the India games.
The India matches are broadcast in prime time for the Indian audience, while non-India matches are aired in the early morning, he added.
""Appointment viewing is missing from the tournament due to the inconvenient timing of non-Indian matches,"" Khemka said. ""In a World Cup, non-India matches are just as important as India matches to drive viewership.""
Advertisers predicted low viewership due to time zone differences between India and the host countries, the US, and the West Indies. However, Khemka anticipates an increase in viewership as the tournament progresses towards the business end.
Khemka believes that the ad self-declaration issue has also impacted the T20 World Cup because a lot of advertisers are in wait-and-watch mode.

"Trai suggests infrastructure status, single-window clearance for broadcasting sector",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/trai-suggests-infrastructure-status-single-window-clearance-for-broadcasting-sector/articleshow/111147312.cms,20-06-2024,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) has sought 'infrastructure' status for the country's broadcasting industry to help draw significant funds to the sector that is expected to play a key role in telling the country's stellar growth story to a global audience.
In its recommendations to the government on formulating the
National Broadcasting Policy
(NBP), the Trai has also said that the process of granting approvals be digitised through
single-window clearance
.
In July 2023, the ministry of information and broadcasting had urged Trai to provide its inputs for the formulation of the NBP. The Trai had issued a consultation paper on NBP seeking stakeholder comments in April.
While suggesting steps to grow the TV and radio footprint in the country, the regulator has also asked the MIB to establish a credible
audience measurement system
for TV, radio, and OTT.
The regulator said that the existing audience measurement system must be revamped. The Broadcast Audience Research Council is the de facto TV measurement body in India.
Live Events
The MIB must create a framework for the disclosure of viewership data by
OTT services
, the Trai added. Currently, OTT platforms don't make viewership data public.
The
broadcasting sector
regulator has also urged the government to enable the creation of
Special Economic Zones
(SEZs) for setting up content creation hubs.
Copyrights
Trai also wants to strengthen the
intellectual property rights
(IPR) regime for content creators, besides clamping down on piracy through
copyright protection
and stringent law enforcement through anti-piracy units and specialised tribunals for quick disposal of copyright infringement cases.
It is also recommended that DD Free Dish, which reaches 40-50 million rural homes, become an addressable and encrypted platform to prevent piracy.
According to Trai, an inter-ministerial committee should be constituted under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, including MIB, the ministry of home affairs, and the IT ministry, to strengthen enforcement mechanisms for combating piracy.
To measure the contribution of the broadcasting sector to the GDP, the Trai has suggested a collaboration between the National Statistical Office, industry associations, and academic institutions.
The Trai recommended that the existing broadband and telecom infrastructure be utilised to increase the TV and radio footprint in rural and far-flung areas.
TV distribution platforms must be encouraged to come out with low-cost content offerings, it noted.
The authority said that a 'Technology Development Fund' must be set up to support R&D and startups in the broadcasting sector.
It was also said that a 'Centre of Excellence for Broadcasting' should be set up at technological institutes and industry associations for testing emerging broadcasting technology. To make India a broadcast uplinking hub, the Trai said that collaborations between foreign companies and Indian partners must be encouraged through bilateral agreements.
The regulator also said that the 'National Policy for Growth of the 'Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality' (AVGC-XR) Sector in India' should be notified in mission mode.
To make India a gaming content hub, the Trai also said that the government must unlock the international market for India by creating and supporting infrastructure such as plug-and-play labs and incubators to encourage startups and new players.

for

broadcasting services.
In its 'Recommendations on Inputs for Formulation of National Broadcasting Policy-2024', the TRAI has suggested that the existing audience measurement system in
India
needs to be revamped.
The Broadcast Audience Research Council (
BARC
) is the official
TV
viewership measurement body, while there is no unified third-party measurement system in digital and radio.
The TRAI has recommended expanding the sample size of the audience measurement system to capture India's diversity. It is also in favour of encouraging multiple rating agencies to carry out audience measurement to ensure healthy competition.

The regulator also said that return path data (RPD) and other latest technologies must be utilised to enhance the accuracy of data.
Infrastructure status and ease of doing business
It has also stated that processing the grant of ‘Infrastructure Status’ to the
broadcasting sector
for raising capital for investment in newer technologies must be a priority.
The grant of infrastructure status has been a long-pending demand of the broadcasting sector.

The regulator noted that infrastructure sharing of broadcasting equipment and transport streams among the service providers in the broadcasting and cable television sectors must be encouraged. Telecom infrastructure must be utilised for the provision of broadcasting services, it added.
The regulator also suggested streamlining Right of Way (RoW) processes and standardising RoW charges across all states for laying cables and erecting towers by utilising a single window clearance and centralised payment system.
Reiterating its earlier recommendation, the TRAI has also stated that the ease of doing business in the broadcasting sector should be improved by digitising permissions and providing single-window clearance to attract long-term foreign and domestic investment for the growth of the sector.
Measuring impact of broadcasting on GDP

The TRAI has called for the establishment of an institutional framework to gauge the broadcasting sector's contribution to India's economy in collaboration with the National Statistical Office under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme.
The parameters are to be measured in terms of gross output and value addition for direct economic contributions such as revenue generation, employment generation, subscription figures, etc., as well as other indirect economic contributions.
While the exact contribution of the broadcasting sector to the economy is not available, the TRAI noted that the combined contribution from trade, hotels, transport, communication, and broadcasting sectors constitutes 17.57% of the GDP for the years 2023–2024.
Policy for AVGC sector
The regulator has said that the notification of the 'National Policy for Growth of the 'Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality' Sector in India is in mission mode.
In order to enable the reach and access of television broadcasting services to uncovered households, it has proposed leveraging fixed-line broadband infrastructure, including that created under BharatNet, to extend the reach of television services in rural and low-density television areas.
Expanding reach of TV
It has called upon the MIB to devise subsidised bundled schemes through the Public Service Broadcaster for the provision of ‘DD Free Dish’ services, including television sets and CPE, to the marginalised, tribal, and economically weaker sections.
According to TRAI, the TV distribution platforms must be encouraged to devise low-cost offerings, curate content for rural underpenetrated areas, and identify, reactivate, and reuse inactive set-top boxes through appropriate incentive schemes.
The TRAI has suggested promoting R&D and securing IPR in the broadcasting sector and manufacturing and adopting new technologies, including indigenous broadcasting technologies and equipment.
Other key recommendations
Among other recommendations, the regulator has also proposed enhancing employment through training and upskilling, promoting innovation, empowering startups, fostering economic growth, making India an uplinking hub for television channels, and utilising digital terrestrial broadcasting.
The TRAI has recommended the establishment of a 'Centre of Excellence for Broadcasting' at leading technological institutes and industry associations for research, standardisation, development, and testing of emerging broadcasting technologies.
The government must aim to promote manufacturing of core electronics components through production-linked incentive schemes, aiming to create a 'Global Manufacturing Hub' for the broadcasting sector, the TRAI said.
Combating piracy
The regulator has recommended that DD Free Dish should be migrated from an unencrypted non-addressable system to digital addressable systems to prevent piracy and unauthorised re-distribution of the content.
It also suggested that the MIB should collaborate with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) for establishing dedicated anti-piracy units within LEAs and provide them with necessary tools and resources to proactively combat physical and digital piracy activities in real-time.
To fast-track the disposal of copyright infringement cases, the TRAI has said that specialised courts or tribunals must be established at both Centre and State level.

In March,
Dish TV
's shareholders voted out Sunil Khanna and Sonal Bankim Parekh as independent directors and Ravi Bhushan Puri as executive director.
Prior to that, Dish TV's shareholders rejected the company's proposal to appoint Rajesh Sahni, Virender Kumar Tagra, Aanchal David, and Shankar Aggarwal as directors in December 2023.
JC Flowers
, which has inherited a 24.19% stake in Dish TV from
Yes Bank
, has been at loggerheads with the company's promoters, led by Jawahar Goel. The company's management has also declined the request of minority shareholders to hold an EGM.
In 2020, Yes Bank acquired a 24.19% stake in Dish TV after invoking pledged shares due to debt default by the promoter family. Subhash Chandra, the elder brother of Jawahar Goel, had secured Rs 6500 crore in loans from Yes Bank.
JC Flowers had arrived at a settlement with Chandra by taking a 75% haircut on the loan amount. The settlement includes the 24.19% stake in Dish TV.

Delhi HC restrains unauthorised broadcast of T20 cricket world cup,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/delhi-hc-restrains-unauthorised-broadcast-of-t20-cricket-world-cup/articleshow/110999686.cms,14-06-2024,"New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has restrained the unauthorised streaming and
broadcast
of the ongoing
ICC Men's T20 World Cup
on a plea by its official broadcaster expressing strong apprehension over illegal dissemination of major sporting events in the past. Justice Sanjeev Naurla passed the interim order on a lawsuit by
Star India Private Limited
against several rogue websites which were likely to indulge in the unauthorised dissemination of cricket matches on their platforms.
Star India said it held the media rights in respect of various sporting events, including domestic and international cricket matches organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
It submitted that based on past instances of illegal dissemination of major sporting events, there was a strong apprehension that certain online platforms were likely to indulge in such unauthorised streaming of the T20
World Cup
being held from June 2 to June 24 in West Indies and the US.
Stating that it recognised the widespread appeal and significance of ICC events, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, the court observed that unauthorised telecasting of these events poses a significant threat to the revenue streams of the plaintiff which owns several channels and online video-streaming platform Hotstar.
""Therefore, swift action to prevent such infringements is crucial to preserving the plaintiff's investment in the broadcasting rights and maintaining their copyright protection,"" the court said in a recent order.

"When TV shows end, fans experience grief similar to losing a partner or close friend: Study",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/when-tv-shows-end-fans-experience-grief-similar-to-losing-a-partner-or-close-friend-study/articleshow/110997522.cms,14-06-2024,"We've all had that one
TV show
where week after week, season after season, we became deeply enmeshed in its universe. We forged complex relationships with its characters, loving some and loathing others, until their world felt like a part of our own. But then, the inevitable happens: the show ends, leaving a cavernous void that makes us ponder our next move in life. Sound familiar?
While
emotional responses
like sadness and a sense of loss following the conclusion of a favourite series are well-known, they have rarely been the subject of thorough investigation—until recently.
Adam Gerace, a psychologist from CQUniversity in Australia, has tackled this issue head-on with a comprehensive study on fans’ reactions to the conclusion of the
TV series
Neighbours. This iconic show, which captivated audiences in Australia and the UK from 1985 to 2022, outlasted many of its viewers’ real-life relationships with a run of 37 years!
Probing post-finale pain
To delve into the emotional aftermath of a beloved show's ending, Gerace enlisted volunteers to complete online surveys reflecting their feelings about the show’s conclusion.
The survey aimed to gauge the extent of
grief
and other emotions tied to the show’s end, focusing not only on the series as a whole, but also on individual characters. It evaluated how well participants accepted the show's end, the distress over losing their beloved characters, and whether they achieved a sense of closure.

Analysing the 1,289 responses gathered shortly after the final episode aired, Gerace discovered a pronounced sense of grief among many viewers. Many found it hard to come to terms with the abrupt disappearance of the show and their favourite characters.
This emotional intensity was particularly evident in viewers who had developed ""parasocial"" empathic bonds with the characters—treating them almost as friends or members of their social circle. For context, parasocial refers to one-sided relationships where an individual feels a deep emotional bond with someone who doesn’t share or even recognise that connection. This dynamic often manifests in the attachments we form with media figures.
The survey further indicated that fans who watched for entertainment and to experience different lifestyles, along with those who felt a strong connection to the series, also exhibited more profound grief and loss compared to viewers with other motives.
Overall, the study revealed that viewers experienced a form of grief comparable to losing a real-life partner, friend or other significant person.
These findings contribute to our understanding of parasocial relationships and media engagement, providing evidence that the end of a cherished series or character can evoke a genuine grief experience.
The study was recently published on the open-access site
PLOS ONE
and can be accessed

Digital News
Publishers Association (DNPA) for a revenue sharing mechanism with
big tech
firms such as
Google
and
Meta
for using their content.
The meeting was chaired by I&B Secretary Sanjay Jaju where representatives from the DNPA and other government departments were present.
The DNPA had petitioned the government to evolve a revenue sharing mechanism with big technology companies such as Google and Meta that aggregate and distribute content created by others and monetise the internet traffic generated in the process.
According to the DNPA, such practices have been affecting the business of the digital news publishers.
Australia and Canada have taken legal steps that make big technology companies pay the local news publishers for the content generated by them and used by the platforms linked to such mega firms.

Self-declaration on ads should be done by June 18: MIB to media,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/self-declaration-on-ads-should-be-done-by-june-18-mib-to-media/articleshow/110919621.cms,12-06-2024,"Mumbai: A meeting between the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (
MIB
) and
advertising
and
media
industry bodies on Tuesday ended in a stalemate, with the former insisting that the mandate on
self-declaration
certificate (SDC) for
ads
must be implemented by
June 18
, citing a Supreme Court order.
The meeting, held under the chairmanship of MIB secretary Sanjay Jaju, was attended by Madison World chairman Sam Balsara, who was representing the media agencies; Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation secretary general Sidharth Jain; Advertising Standards Council of India's Manisha Kapoor and Google India's Satya Raghavan, among others.
The industry bodies were expecting the MIB to come up with solutions that would have ensured compliance with the Supreme Court verdict while taking care of their concerns about the difficulties in implementing the SDC mandate.
According to an official who attended the meeting, the MIB told the stakeholders that any delay in the implementation of the SDC mandate could result in contempt of the SC order dated May 7.
""The stakeholders told the MIB that the SDC mandate will be very cumbersome to implement and might not lead to the desired outcome of weeding out misleading ads,"" the official said, requesting anonymity.

A media executive, privy to the discussions during the meeting, said the MIB has told the stakeholders that it would collate all the industry representations and seek a legal opinion from the government's law officers about them.
The industry representations and the legal opinion provided by the law officers of the government could be included in the affidavit that the ministry would file before the SC, the executive added.
""Some industry bodies that are aligned with advertisers and internet companies might also get impleaded in the matter before the SC,"" the executive said.
On June 3, the MIB issued an order stating that SDC by advertisers for broadcasting and publishing ads on TV, print, digital, and radio will be mandatory from June 18.
As per the Supreme Court order, advertisers will have to submit an SDC affirming that ads do not make misleading claims and comply with all relevant regulatory guidelines.
The advertisers will have to submit and generate SDC from the Broadcast Seva portal for TV and radio ads and the Press Council of India (PCI) portal for print and digital ads. The advertisers and their agencies will have to submit an SDC before publishing or broadcasting any ad.
The Indian Society of Advertisers (ISA) told the MIB that the SDC mandate would not only be time-consuming and cost-intensive for advertisers due to the sheer volume of advertising but could also lead to disruption in ad campaigns.
As per TAM Media, nearly 340 million ads are released in internet and digital media by 130,000 advertisers in a year. In print, 3 million ads are released by 151,000 advertisers, while on TV, 86 million ads are released by 8,000 advertisers.
The ISA said the sudden surge in traffic on the Broadcast Seva and PCI portals could impact their functioning, which, in turn, might impact the ad ecosystem.
The SDC mandate is expected to impact the digital ad ecosystem in particular, as 42% of all advertising is programmatic, which is an automated way of running ads.

The Ramoji Film City has been recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's largest film city.
Thousands of films have been filmed at Ramoji Film City on the outskirts of Hyderabad, including SS Rajamouli's renowned 'Bahubali' series. The facility has hosted productions in nearly all Indian languages and several major Hindi blockbusters.
Ramoji Rao's unique style of film making on a low budget and often on social themes earned him laurels.
Rise of Eenadu
The Eenadu newspaper, established by
Ramoji Rao
in Visakhapatnam in 1974, transformed the newspaper industry in undivided Andhra Pradesh. It remains the most widely circulated Telugu daily, with numerous editions. Under Rao's leadership, known for his commitment to punctuality, Eenadu set a standard by consistently reaching readers before sunrise, unlike the previously common practice of delayed deliveries.
The newspaper's campaign 'to restore democracy' when TDP founder N T Rama Rao was dislodged from power in 1984 in a bloodless coup which ultimately led to NTR returning to power is a milestone in Ramoji Rao's life.
Several Telugu words coined by Eenadu with the advent of internet have become part of the Telugu languauge.
The
ETV
bouquet
ETV emerged as one of the pioneering satellite entertainment channels in Telugu, breaking the monopoly previously held by Doordarshan. It quickly became a popular household name.
ETV's network of channels rapidly grew, incorporating ETV news in Telugu as well as in languages like Kannada, Bengali, Hindi, and others.
'Padutha Teeyaga', a music show anchored by late S P Balasubrahmanyam for almost two decades on ETV, introduced thousands of budding singers.
The Priya brand of pickles manufactured by Priya Foods is a household name in several parts of the country and also popular in foreign countries like the US.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also expressed grief at his death, describing him as a visionary who revolutionised Indian media.
Rao's rich contributions have left an indelible mark on journalism and the world of films, Modi said on X, adding that through his noteworthy efforts, he set new standards in innovation and excellence in the media and entertainment world.
— narendramodi (@narendramodi)
President Droupadi Murmu offered condolences on the demise of Rao. The President said that with the demise of Ramoji Rao, India has lost a titan of the media and entertainment sector.
""An innovative entrepreneur, he pioneered many ventures, including the Eenadu newspaper, ETV news network and Ramoji Film City. Honoured with Padma Vibhushan, he succeeded as his vision was essentially rooted in society. His contributions to this industry will be long remembered. My condolences to his family and well-wishers,"" President Murmu said in a post on X.
— rashtrapatibhvn (@rashtrapatibhvn)
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and former CM of Andhra Pradesh Jagan Mohan Reddy also mourned the demise of Ramoji Rao on Saturday.
Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo N Chandrababu Naidu also expressed grief over the demise of Rao.
— ncbn (@ncbn)
As per reports, Ramoji Rao had previously battled and successfully recovered from colon cancer a few years ago.
In 2016, he received the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award in India, from then-President Pranab Mukherjee
Telangana Government decided to perform the last rites of Ramoji Rao with state honors.
The Chief Minister Revanth Reddy issued orders through the Chief Secretary to Rangareddy Collector and Cyberabad Commissioner to supervise the arrangements for the conduct of last rites with state honours.

Urge all stakeholders to stand against threats to press freedom: Subhash Chandra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/urge-all-stakeholders-to-stand-against-threats-to-press-freedom-subhash-chandra/articleshow/110669937.cms,03-06-2024,"New Delhi:
Media
is considered as the fourth pillar of
democracy
, but faces increasing pressure from the governing class- whether it’s legislature, executive, and even the corporates, said
Subhash Chandra
, chairman emeritus of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
in a press briefing Monday.
Highlighting a recent incident which led to a legal tussle between the
AAP government
in Punjab and Zee, Chandra said he would urge all stakeholders, including Zee's viewers and regulatory bodies, to recognize and stand against the '
threats
' to
press freedom
.
""I and my team are ready to pay a price or face any consequences, to keep fulfilling our Dharma towards our readers and viewers,"" Chandra said.
He said governments exert pressure on media through
advertising influence
or use of state machinery to threaten so that the press can be prevented from publishing factual information.
“There are structured attempts by them to align the media in order to achieve their agenda. Unfortunately, many of the news channels, newspapers, social media and digital platforms have started accepting the pressure as part of life, instead of resisting or voicing out their disagreement,” said Chandra. “This is one reason why
India
ranks 159th out of 180 in terms of press freedom. The natural blame gets inclined towards the Government, but the media itself is equally responsible,” he added.
Live Events
He said
Zee
Media’s flagship channel
Zee News
, recently faced an ‘alarming incident of Governmental suppression of media’s
independence
.’
As per Zee, on May 23, an interview of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was conducted by a senior journalist of Zee News.
Zee said post the interview, the independent editorial team at Zee Media decided not to telecast it, keeping in mind some ‘objectionable content’ in the interaction. Some portions of the interview were telecasted as well but the spokesperson of
Aam Aadmi Party
(AAP) kept insisting that Zee News must publish the entire interview else it will face consequences like withdrawal of advertising (which was substantial on a monthly basis), as per the company's account of the events.
“I wondered, what else will they do to penalise us and prosecute our freedom. I discovered soon that the
Government
of Punjab forced a black out across the state, leveraging a monopoly of a particular Multiple System Operator (MSO),” said Chandra.
“The black out was forced, not only for Zee News, but also for Zee PHH and Zee Delhi NCR. The state government also extended the blackout of
Zee Entertainment
channels. To add further AAP withdrew all the spokespersons from participating in debates held by Zee Media’s news channels. Zee fought this battle independently and got the channels restored by seeking justice through a legal approach,” he added.
Chandra said the company’s response would have been the same had it been an issue with the central government.
“This is a real time and live example of political parties suppressing us as a fourth state. Today it is Zee, while tomorrow it can be any other news channel, news publication or platform,” he said.

"IPL 2024 audience reach on TV, digital platforms hits a record",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-2024-audience-reach-on-tv-digital-platforms-hits-a-record/articleshow/110472200.cms,27-05-2024,"The Indian Premier League (
IPL
) 2024 has become the largest ever edition in terms of
audience reach
on
TV
and digital, even as the
viewership data
for the business end of the tournament has yet to come out.
The IPL kicked off on March 22 and concluded on May 26. The
Kolkata Knight Riders
defeated
Sunrisers Hyderabad
to win the title for the third time.
As per the Broadcast Audience Research (BARC) data, the official broadcaster
Star Sports
has clocked an audience reach of 546 million for 67 matches, with the data for the remaining seven still remaining.
According to sources privy to the development, official streamer
JioCinema
has touched an audience reach of 550–600 million towards the end of the tournament, though
Viacom18
has not made the latest viewership data public.
In the previous edition of the tournament, the TV and digital reach stood at 505 million and 449 million on Star Sports and JioCinema, respectively.
Live Events
Experts believe that the audience reach of the tournament is increasing due to the quality of matches coupled with measures by the media partners to take the IPL to the widest possible corner of the country.
TAM Media
CEO LV Krishnan said that there are three key factors that drove more audiences to the IPL.
First, there was more in-home viewing this year, particularly in the North and West India, helped by the extreme heat wave, particularly in the last one month.
Secondly, the IPL drew a lot of new audiences due to the discovery of new younger players like Rinku Singh and Abhishek Sharma, whose performances were heavily highlighted on social media and news channels.
Thirdly, regular viewers were closely watching their favourite star players' performances, enhancing time spent and engagement with the event.
""
IPL 2024
is the biggest edition in the tournament's history. The unduplicated audience reach of IPL on both TV and digital would be 650–675 million. There is almost a 70% overlap between the audiences that watch IPL on TV and digital,"" he added.
D and P Advisory Managing Partner Santosh N said ad revenue growth has not kept pace with viewership increases due to the tightening of ad spend by new-age brands.
""Traditional advertisers have come to the rescue of the IPL, but they are also weighing their options between multiple properties,"" he added.
A senior industry official said the ad spends on IPL have seen a healthy increase this year compared to last year, when the ad spend dropped to Rs 4,000 crore.
For IPL 2024,
Disney Star
was seeking Rs 167 crore for co-presenting and Rs 83 crore for associate sponsorships on standard-definition (SD) channels, Rs 71 crore for co-presenting, and Rs 35 crore for associate sponsorship on high-definition channels (HD).
The spot-buy rates for SD and HD were Rs 12.8 lakh per 10 seconds and Rs 5.45 lakh per 10 seconds, respectively.
On the other hand, Viacom18's JioCinema was seeking Rs 200 CPM for 10-second midroll and pre roll mobile video ads, while FCT ad rates for live matches on mobile and connected TV were Rs 16 lakh and Rs 6.5 lakh, respectively.
The broadcaster was seeking investments of Rs 40 crore and Rs 30.5 crore for features such as Super 4s and Super 6s.

Reliance Industries
has sought approval from fair trade regulator
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) for the USD 8.5-billion merger of
Viacom18
and
Star India Pvt Ltd
(SIPL). ""The proposed transaction aims to combine the
entertainment businesses
(along with certain other identified businesses) of Viacom18, part of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) group and SIPL, wholly-owned by
The Walt Disney Company
(TWDC).
""As a result of the transaction, SIPL, currently a wholly-owned entity of TWDC through its subsidiaries, will become a
joint venture
(JV) which will be jointly held by RIL, Viacom18 and existing TWDC subsidiaries,"" a notice filed with the CCI said on Friday.
The proposed transaction will not cause any appreciable adverse effect on competition in India, RIL said in the notice.
However, to facilitate the CCI's assessment, they have identified several key markets where horizontal overlaps were significant such as licensing of audio visual content rights, distribution of broadcast TV channels, provision of audio visual (AV) content, and supply of advertising space in India.
SIPL is engaged in a range of media activities, including TV broadcasting, motion pictures and operation of an
OTT platform
. It is a wholly-owned entity of US-based The
Walt Disney Company
(TWDC).
Live Events
Viacom18 is engaged in the business of broadcasting of television (TV) channels, operation of an over-the-top (OTT) platform, in India and worldwide. It is also engaged in the business of production and distribution of motion pictures.
In February this year,
global media
giant
Walt Disney Co
and Reliance Industries announced signing of binding pacts to merge their
media operations
in India to create a Rs 70,000 crore (USD 8.5 billion) behemoth.
After the successful completion of the deal, it would create the biggest firm in the Indian media and entertainment sector, with over 100 channels in several languages, two leading OTT platforms and a viewer base of 750 million across the country.
Nita Ambani, wife of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, will chair the joint venture, while Uday Shankar will be the Vice Chairperson.
Reliance and its affiliates will hold 63.16 per cent stake in the combined entity, while Disney will have the remaining 36.84 per cent shareholding. Reliance has also agreed to invest around Rs 11,500 crore into the joint venture to grow the OTT business.

The transaction values
Tata Play Ltd.
at about $1 billion, the people said.
Tata
Group took full control of the TV platform after buying the 29.8% stake from Disney, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private.

Nikhil Kamath
has invested in the Vijay Subramaniam-led
Collective Artists Network
, marking their second venture together.
The latest
investment
, a secondary transaction, has resulted in a staggering return, exceeding 5X, for
InMobi

Glance
, which had previously invested in Collective in 2021, the company said in a media release on Wednesday.
Collective Artists Network has transformed into a versatile new media powerhouse, which was originally known for its
talent management
expertise.
Moreover, it also boasts initiatives like
BigBang.Social
, Collective Creative Labs, M19, and strategic acquisitions such as
Under 25 Universe

Nikhil Kamath expressed his excitement about investing in Collective's vision, highlighting his belief in
Vijay Subramaniam
's vision for the transformation of the industry.
""I’ve witnessed the company's evolution over the last couple of years and I've known Vijay now closely and believe in his vision of the transformation of this space. We share a similar outlook towards the India story. I look forward to being part of this journey wherein Collective challenges the status quo and aims to redefine the
media landscape
and the
creator ecosystem
,” Kamath said.
Meanwhile, Vijay Subramaniam said, ""Nikhil's investment is not merely a financial endorsement; it symbolizes the trust and synergy we've cultivated over the years. I have been clear since the onset that we need to institutionalise our space which has largely been unorganised. This vision will ensure we provide shareholder value and set new benchmarks in media, tech and entertainment.”

The company said that the impact on consolidated results was Rs 98 crore in 2022-23, as the losses incurred by these entities were recorded in the earlier financial results.
Further, the company estimated the liability to fund the closure costs at Rs 32 crore in 2023-24.
Zee Entertainment, which has trimmed its headcount by 15% as part of aggressive cost-cutting measures, has also recorded an employee termination cost of Rs 22 crore as part of a recent restructuring.
On the arbitration cases filed by Culver Max Entertainment and
Star India
against the company, Zee Entertainment claimed that there won't be any material adverse impact as both cases were untenable.
Culver Max Entertainment has approached the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, seeking $90 million in termination fees from Zee Entertainment over alleged violations of the merger agreement.
Likewise, Star India has moved the London Court of International Arbitration seeking directions for Zee Entertainment to either implement the International Cricket Council (ICC) TV rights agreement between the two companies or provide compensation for damages the company has suffered.

NCLT sets the ball rolling on merger of Reliance's arm Viacom18 and Star India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/nclt-sets-the-ball-rolling-on-merger-of-reliances-arm-viacom18-and-star-india/articleshow/110192337.cms,17-05-2024,"The Mumbai bench of the
National Company Law Tribunal
has admitted the
merger
scheme between
Reliance Industries Ltd
's
Viacom18
, its wholly-owned subsidiary
Digital18
and
Walt Disney
's
Star India
, marking the first step towards completion of the mega-merger deal.
In an order passed on May 7, a division bench of judicial member Kishore Vemulapalli and technical member Anu Jagmohan Singh directed the companies to convene a meeting of their secured and unsecured creditors to get approval for the merger scheme.
The tribunal has appointed retired Justice Suresh Chandrakant Gupte as chairperson for the meetings of secured and unsecured creditors of Viacom18 and unsecured creditors of Star India.
In the absence of Justice Gupte as chairperson, Naina Krishna Murthy, partner at Krishnamurthy & Co, will assume the role.
B Narsimhan, proprietor of
BN Associates
, has been appointed as scrutiniser for the meetings of creditors of the two companies. If Narsimhan is unable to serve as the scrutiniser, Venkataraman K will be appointed in his place.
Live Events
It has also directed the companies to serve notices along with a copy of the merger scheme to the central government through the offices of the regional director (western region), Mumbai, the Registrar of Companies, the income tax authority, the goods & services tax authorities, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), the ministry of corporate affairs and other sectoral and regulatory authorities.
The bench stated that if authorities don't respond to notices within 30 days, it will be assumed that they don't have any objections to the proposed scheme.
The merger scheme has two stages: the transfer of Viacom18's TV and streaming
assets
to Digital18 and the demerger and vesting of these assets from Digital18 to Star India.
As consideration for the scheme, Viacom18 will transfer streaming platform JioCinema to Digital18, which will pay the company a consideration of Rs 24,186 crore through an allotment of 24.18 billion fully paid-up shares of Rs 10 each.
Viacom18 will also transfer its
media
operations to Digital18 for a consideration of Rs 2,769 crore in the form of an allotment of 2.76 billion fully paid-up shares of Rs 10 each.
Digital18 will then transfer Viacom18 assets to Star India, which will allot proportionate shares among all Digital18 shareholders. Star will also allot shares to
RIL
for its fund infusion of $1.4 billion.
Star India's shareholding will be divided among Walt Disney (36.63%), Digital18 (46.11%) and RIL (16.34%) after the allotment of shares to Digital18 and RIL.
In a separate order dated May 15, the
NCLT
Mumbai bench has approved the amalgamation of Novi Digital Entertainment, the owner of Disney+ Hotstar, with its parent company, Star India.
It is pertinent to note that Viacom18 has two shareholders—RIL and its group entities and Bodhi Tree Systems, promoted by James Murdoch and Uday Shankar. Paramount Global has decided to exit Viacom18 by selling its 13% stake to RIL for Rs 4,286 crore.
The application was filed by the companies on March 29, a month after the announcement of the mega merger deal that will lead to the creation of a $8.5 billion media behemoth with leadership positions in both linear TV and video streaming segments.
The applicant companies are required to provide information on their corporate guarantee, performance guarantee, contingent liabilities and whether they have any pending IBC cases, along with details of litigation, letters of credit and margin money details.
Ashish K Singh, managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal, said the order is an important procedural step towards the merger. In addition to calling a meeting of creditors and members of both companies, NCLT has directed that tax authorities may also be informed about the proposed merger. This step is likely to take around 30 days.
“In addition to conducting the meeting, both entities are required to submit a list of any litigation related to IBC before the NCLT. This exercise is undertaken for the greater interest of shareholders,” said Singh..
The Star-Viacom18 combined will have over 100 TV channels and two streaming platforms—Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema. The entity will have over 750 million viewers across India and will also cater to the Indian diaspora across the world.

Tata Play will now give Amazon Prime benefits & liberty to choose your own OTT bundles,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tata-play-will-now-give-amazon-prime-benefits-liberty-to-choose-your-own-ott-bundles/articleshow/110085542.cms,14-05-2024,"Tata Play
has collaborated with
Amazon Prime
to offer
Tata Play DTH
and
Tata Play Binge
customers multiple ways to access Prime’s content and other benefits such as same-day delivery, the companies said in a press release.
Speaking exclusively to
ET Online
,
Harit Nagpal
, Managing Director and CEO of Tata Play, said it is about providing convenience to users and this move to bundle
apps
is a new category.
""At this point in time, we are making efforts to increase the size of the category from a miniscule size to something material. So, we haven’t set (revenue) targets. We are just doing the activities in these stages,"" he said.
“We will get numbers, it’s a new category. First of all, subscribed apps are a very small category in a new category. We are not competing with free apps, these are paid apps. We are trying to stimulate the usage of paid apps through this aggregation. If we set targets, we would be limiting ourselves,"" he added.
Tata Play
DTH subscribers can now choose from multiple packs starting from Rs 199 per month, that offer a variety of their favourite TV channels along with
Prime Lite
with Tata Play.
Live Events
Binge subscribers can also enjoy Prime Lite with Tata Play along with 30+ other popular apps at various price points. Users can subscribe to six OTT apps from a list of 33 apps, including
Prime Video
at Rs 199 per month or can subscribe to all 33, including Prime Video at Rs 349 per month. The new price plans from Tata Play
Binge
have given the freedom of choice to make their own OTT packs.
“If you had to subscribe to Binge you had to pay 349 for 33 apps but increasingly we were getting customers who say we don’t want all 33 apps. You can now choose any 6 apps of your choice from the entire menu of 33, whichever 6 you choose, and pay just Rs 199 per month,” said Harit Nagpal.
The collaboration between Tata Play and
Amazon
Prime is dedicated to offering comprehensive value to the customers, including video, shipping and shopping benefits. This will include free unlimited same day delivery across more than 1 million products and next day delivery across 4 million products, Prime early access and exclusive deals, and 5% cashback on Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card while shopping on Amazon.
“While on the one hand, Tata Play’s robust content distribution network will help in expanding Amazon Prime’s outreach to newer audience segments, on the other, addition of Prime Lite Membership with Tata Play will make Binge a more compelling proposition,” Nagpal said.
In addition to the new plans,
DTH
customers can also subscribe to the annual
subscription
of Amazon Prime through Tata Play DTH with an introductory offer, and gain access to Prime Video on five screens, free shipping/ shopping benefits, Amazon Music, Prime Reading, and Prime Gaming.
“At Prime Video, our mission is to super-serve our customers with the best of
entertainment
, and we are constantly looking at ways to strengthen our distribution to ensure wider availability of our much-loved movies and series,” said Gaurav Gandhi, vice president, APAC & Prime Video.
Talking about popularity of OTTs, Nagpal said the craze is for the free OTT, which anybody who doesn’t have money can subscribe to and start consuming.
""We are in the business of subscribed OTT category. Don’t put all OTTs into one basket. This category is small compared to the free ones. I am creating a paid category where OTT brands make money and customers pay money and therefore they are tempted to make better quality of content, so people enjoy it more and pay even more. I am not selling any free OTT category, I am selling the paid OTT category,"" Nagpal said.
Meanwhile, Tata Play has seen a spike in subscribers amid the IPL season and its 4K offering to subscribers of the Binge+ android box has also picked well.
Nagpal said every subsequent cricket tournament, be it the World Cup, the Asia Cup, as well as this IPL, has successively given a higher growth than the previous one, despite the same product being available for free, on free apps.
""As regards 4K, you know every box can’t access 4K, it is only the subscribers of the Binge+ android box which is connected to the internet, can watch 4K content. Considering all those parameters, the numbers look extremely good and beyond our expectations. We didn’t expect these numbers, rather we didn’t even advertise this, it only worked on word of mouth,"" he said.

Hotstar
on Wednesday said smartphone users in India will be able to watch this year's
ICC Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup
for free on the
OTT platform
, a model they offered during the ODI World Cup and Asia Cup last year that had fetched them record viewers.
The eagerly awaited
ICC
Men's
T20 World Cup
2024 is scheduled to take place in the USA and the Caribbean starting on June 2. With 20 teams participating, matches will be held across three venues in the United States and six in the Caribbean.
The
T20 World Cup
will begin days after the conclusion of the high-octane
Indian Premier League
, which for sure will make cricket fans stay excited for the mega global event and millions will be watching the Men in Blue, or the
Indian cricket team
led by
Rohit Sharma
, fight for glory. India is also set to clash with arch rivals Pakistan on June 9, a match cricket fans across the globe will be watching out for.
Also, some matches such as those between Australia and England, West Indies and New Zealand at the group stages also promise to be exciting clashes and are expected to attract a large number of viewers.
Disney+ Hotstar's playbook to offer T20 World Cup for free on Hotstar isn't a first such move by
broadcast companies
, but what the free strategy locks in is it will have a huge volume of audience whom
advertisers
can then tap for wider reach.

“By offering the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 for free on mobile, we aim to make the game of cricket more accessible, reach a wider audience across the country and ensure that none of the sporting action is missed. No sport works as a better catalyst than cricket in bringing people together,"" Sajith Sivanandan - Head, Disney+ Hotstar India said.
During last year's Asia Cup and ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup, Hotstar had provided both the tournaments for free on mobile, enabling it to reach new audience segments and greatly expand viewership, he added.
During the ICC Men’s
Cricket World Cup
2023, fans could watch matches for free on their mobile and tablets with the Disney+ Hotstar app. At its busiest, there were a whopping 5.9 crore people watching the finals between India and Australia at a single time. Disney+ Hotstar had even introduced something cool called MaxView, which let viewers watch matches vertically on phones and this time too the broadcaster is gearing up to offer more features for better viewing experience.
While Disney+ Hotstar will stream the matches on handheld devices, Star Sports is the official broadcaster on TV.
India's T20 World Cup Squad
Rohit Sharma will lead the 15-member squad, with Rishabh Pant taking charge behind the stumps. Sanju Samson has also earned a spot in the squad. Meanwhile, Hardik Pandya has been named the vice-captain.
In addition to vice-captain Hardik, the team boasts all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube. Furthermore, the squad features three spinners alongside Jadeja: Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, and leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who makes a comeback after a break. Chahal's last T20I for India was against the West Indies in August 2023, while Samson and Dube last played in January against Afghanistan.

Star India
's
operating loss
from the sports business has increased by 50% to $342 million for the six months ended March 30, compared to $228 million in the corresponding six months of the previous fiscal.
For the period under review, the Walt Disney-owned company's operating
revenue
from the sports business rose 40% to $504 million, while operating expenses jumped 51% to $786 million.
In its
Q2 results
,
Walt Disney
said that the higher programming and production costs at Star India were attributable to higher
rights
costs for ICC and, to a lesser extent,
IPL cricket programming
in the current period compared to the prior-year period.
Walt Disney follows the October to September fiscal calendar.
The increase in
ICC cricket programming
costs was due to an increase in average costs per match and more matches aired, while the increase in costs for
IPL cricket
programming was due to more matches aired, it added.

The American entertainment giant also said that these increases were partially offset by the comparison to costs for
BCCI
cricket programming in the prior-year period as we did not renew the rights for the current fiscal year.
The company's
ad revenue
for the first six months more than doubled to $221 million, while
affiliate revenue
declined 3% to $128 million.
Star India's sports business narrowed its operating loss by 73% to $27 million for the quarter ended March 30 due to lower programming and production costs attributable to the non-renewal of
Board of Control for Cricket in India
rights, partially offset by an increase in costs for
Indian Premier League
matches due to more matches aired in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter.
India sports revenue dropped 17% to $105 million, while operating expenses for the quarter declined by 48% to $102 million. Ad revenue for the quarter increased by 9% to $37 million, even though affiliate revenue remained stagnant at $63 million.

Future cash flows are based on internal forecasts that consider factors such as projected inflation, economic indicators, and industry growth projections.

Viacom18

Trump Media's newly hired auditing firm was just busted by the SEC for 'massive fraud',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/trump-medias-newly-hired-auditing-firm-was-just-busted-by-the-sec-for-massive-fraud/articleshow/109830311.cms,04-05-2024,"The
Securities and Exchange Commission
on Friday charged an
auditing firm
hired by
Trump Media
and Technology Group just 37 days ago with “massive fraud” — though not for any work it performed for former President
Donald Trump
’s media company.
The
SEC
charged the
accounting
firm
BF Borgers
and its owner, Benjamin F. Borgers, with “deliberate and systematic failures” in more than 1,500 audits. The charges include failing to abide by accounting rules, fabricating documentation to cover up its shortcomings, and falsely stating in audit reports that its work met audit standards.
To settle the
SEC charges
, BF Borgers agreed to pay a $12 million fine while its owner agreed to pay a fine of $2 million, according to the SEC. Benjamin Borgers did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
BF Borgers and Benjamin Borgers also agreed to permanent suspensions, effective immediately, that will prevent them handling SEC-related matters as accountants.
Trump Media named BF Borgers as its auditor on March 28, according to the company's most recent annual report filing. The company disclosed at the time that BF Borgers had also handled its audits before the company went public by merging with a cash-rich shell company called Digital World Acquisition Corp.

The company had previously cycled through at least two other auditors — one that resigned the account in July 2023 and another that was terminated by the board in March, just as it was re-hiring BF Borgers. In a statement, Trump Media said it “looks forward to working with new auditing partners in accordance with today’s SEC order.”
The SEC found that BF Borgers' shortcuts included copying audit documentation from a previous year, changing relevant dates and then passing it off as current documentation. In addition to falsely documenting work that was never actually done, that fake documentation detailed planning meetings with clients that never occurred and “falsely represented” that both Benjamin Borgers and another reviewer had approved the audit work.
“Ben Borgers and his audit firm, BF Borgers, were responsible for one of the largest wholesale failures by gatekeepers in our financial markets,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s enforcement division.
""Thanks to the painstaking work of the SEC staff, Borgers and his sham audit mill have been permanently shut down.”

Paramount will let exclusive talks with Skydance lapse,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/paramount-will-let-exclusive-talks-with-skydance-lapse/articleshow/109829691.cms,04-05-2024,"Paramount
Global will end exclusive negotiations with
Skydance
Media without a deal, according to a person familiar with the discussions, allowing it to evaluate a rival bid for the home of ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""SpongeBob SquarePants"".
Shares of Paramount rose 3% in extended trading.
A special committee of the Paramount board, created to evaluate offers for the company, has been holding exclusive deal talks with Skydance Media. That period of exclusivity ends at midnight Friday.
An eleventh-hour overture from
Sony Pictures Entertainment
and private equity firm
Apollo
Global Management expressing interest in acquiring Paramount Global complicated negotiations, another person familiar with the talks told Reuters.
The companies submitted a non-binding offer letter on Wednesday, signed by
Sony
Pictures Chief Executive Tony Vinciquerra and Apollo partner Aaron Sobel, a source confirmed to Reuters. The $26 billion offer is a combination of cash and assumption of debt.
Live Events
That may have forced the special committee's hand, especially after some shareholders raised concerns about the deal with David Ellison's Skydance and have urged Paramount to consider other offers, including the one from Apollo.
A source close to the Redstone family said Shari Redstone, who controls the Paramount media empire, would support the special committee's consideration of a possible Sony-Apollo transaction or any deal that would benefit shareholders.
Paramount's special committee is set to meet on Saturday to discuss the deal, the New York Times reported, citing two people with knowledge of the company's plans.
A spokesman for the special committee declined comment.
Apollo also declined comment to Reuters, which reported in April that Sony Pictures and Apollo were in talks about a joint bid. Paramount and Sony also declined comment on this week's Apollo-Sony offer, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The competing offer comes at a tumultuous time for Paramount.
Shari Redstone's media empire replaced Paramount CEO Bob Bakish with a trio of executives on Monday, while four independent members of the board are set to step down at the company's annual shareholder meeting on June 4.
Bakish was once viewed as Redstone's loyal lieutenant.
However, their relationship began to sour in May 2023, when he urged Redstone to support a cut to the company's share dividend, saying it would lift Paramount's sagging stock, a prediction that never came true, according to two sources close to Redstone.
PARAMOUNT'S STRUGGLES
Paramount, like other studios, has been struggling to recover from last year's months-long strikes by Hollywood writers and actors, a soft advertising market and falling cable subscriptions in the United States that has eroded profit for its TV business.
Its streaming service, Paramount+, also trails rivals such as Netflix and Disney+ in subscriber numbers - even though Redstone had hoped the merger of CBS and Viacom in 2019 would help the combined company, later renamed Paramount Global, compete better.
Shares of Paramount have fallen more than 65% since then, losing more than $14 billion in market value.
After its shares dropped 7% in Friday's trading session, Paramount had a stock market value of about $9 billion, according to LSEG data. The media company carries more than $14 billion of debt.
The potential
acquisition
would help Sony Pictures grow its share of the North American box office. The studio reaped about $1 billion in U.S. and Canada box office revenue last year, compared with Paramount's $842.4 million, according to data from Comscore.
Sony Pictures, a unit of Tokyo-based Sony Group, says its operations span movie and television production, acquisition and distribution, digital content creation and distribution, studio facility operation and the development of new
entertainment
products, services and technologies.
The group has more than 3,500 movie titles and notable franchises such as ""Jumanji"", ""Resident Evil"" and ""James Bond."" Combining Sony and Paramount, whose movie library spans ""Star Trek"", ""Top Gun"" and ""The Godfather,"" would create a formidable Hollywood studio.
This is not the first time Sony has pursued Paramount. Vinciquerra had previously approached Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, to explore acquiring the Paramount Pictures film studio, according to two people familiar with the matter. At the time, Redstone was uninterested in breaking up the company, according to one of the sources.
The expression of interest marks the beginning of a process that would involve due diligence. There also are potential regulatory obstacles to Sony Pictures, a Japanese-owned business, controlling Paramount's CBS broadcast network.
A person familiar with the deal said they hope to mitigate concerns about foreign ownership of a U.S. broadcaster through its partnership with U.S.-based Apollo. The private equity firm acquired Cox Media Group's television stations in a 2019 deal that required approval of the Federal Communications Commission.
Sony would hold a majority stake in the venture, a source previously told Reuters, and operate Paramount, with Apollo as a minority shareholder.

The non-binding expression of interest, sent in a letter this week, comes as Paramount approaches an agreed-upon Friday deadline for the expiration of an exclusive negotiating period with Skydance, a Hollywood studio run by tech scion David Ellison. Paramount has been in talks with
Skydance
for months, discussing a complicated transaction that would involve a merger and an investment from private equity firm Redbird Capital Partners.
The new, joint expression of interest would make Sony a significant majority and controlling shareholder and Apollo a minority shareholder. The proposed all-cash acquisition may appeal to Paramount shareholders who have come out against the Skydance deal over concerns it benefits the company's controlling shareholder, Shari
Redstone
, at the expense of others.
Paramount declined to comment.
The proposed merger of Sony and Paramount would create a new powerhouse in Hollywood, uniting the studios behind the Spider Man and Mission: Impossible franchises. Sony executives have discussed operating the Paramount studio as a division of their broader empire, combining their marketing and distribution functions.

Foreign Ownership
One looming question for both Apollo and Sony is the eventual fate of Paramount's CBS broadcast network. Regulations restrict foreign ownership of broadcast networks, throwing up a potential roadblock for Sony Pictures, a division of Sony Group Corp. One possible remedy under consideration is to have Apollo hold the licence for the CBS broadcast network.
It remains to be seen whether a bid from Sony and Apollo would be acceptable to Redstone, whose controlling stake would allow her to veto any deal.

Essel Group looks to clear JC Flowers' dues by June,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/essel-group-looks-to-clear-jc-flowers-dues-by-june/articleshow/109794722.cms,02-05-2024,"Media baron Subhash Chandra-promoted
Essel Group
is aiming to settle outstanding
debt
owed to
JC Flowers
Asset Reconstruction by June, having already paid the first tranche, around ₹300 crore of the estimated ₹1,500 crore that he owes the company, industry sources aware of the development told ET.
Essel Group is in the process of paying the second tranche of the debt later this month. ""As the payments are made, JC Flowers will start releasing assets, which include
Dish TV
, Zee Learn and some
real estate
assets,"" one of the persons said on the condition of anonymity.
A second source said there has been a lot of positive movement in the last month between the two parties. ""The first tranche of ₹300 crore was paid a few months ago. The second tranche could be paid in the coming days. The eventual goal is to clear the entire outstanding amount by June,"" the executive said.
Chandra, who had to part with a large part of his stake in Zee Entertainment to pare debt, is in talks with interested parties to offload real estate properties and infrastructure assets to clear JC Flowers ARC's debt, said the second person quoted above.
Essel Group and JC Flowers ARC declined to comment.
Live Events
In August 2023, Zee Learn disclosed that the company had reached a settlement agreement with JC Flowers to settle loans taken by certain trusts and entities.
An Essel Group executive had earlier told ET that the group is in talks with corporate houses, real estate developers and leading private equity players for the sale of marquee land properties and a few unlisted infrastructure assets to generate ₹1,500 crore that Chandra is supposed to pay American PE firm JC Flowers to settle his debt obligations and take back control of assets including Dish TV.
Essel Group originally owed ₹6,500 crore to Yes Bank, which was part of the ₹48,000 crore of stressed loans that were transferred to JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction in December 2022.

CCI approves Airtel's buyout of Warburg Pincus affiliate's stake in DTH arm,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/cci-approves-airtels-buyout-of-warburg-pincus-affiliates-stake-in-dth-arm/articleshow/109768002.cms,02-05-2024,"Mumbai: The
Competition Commission of India
(
CCI
) has approved
Bharti Airtel
’s acquisition of an additional 20% stake in its direct-to-home (DTH) arm Bharti
Telemedia
from an affiliate of New York-headquartered private equity firm
Warburg Pincus
, people with knowledge of the matter told ET.
The competition watchdog is expected to publish a detailed public order on the transaction soon, one of the sources said.
While the transaction dates to 2021, the CCI in August 2023 slapped a fine of Rs 1 crore on Airtel for concluding the deal without informing it.
In October 2023, the telecom company sought the competition watchdog’s approval for the transaction that also involved Lion Meadow Investment, an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, acquiring a stake in Bharti Airtel, one of the persons cited above said. The CCI approved the transaction recently, the person added.
In its application to the CCI, Airtel said the transaction is an intra-group shareholding consolidation and does not constitute any change in market dynamics, the entry or exit of any player, or a change in the management of the business operations of BTL.
Live Events
The application identified India's upstream market for digital set-top box manufacturing and sale and the downstream market for aggregating and distributing TV channels through DTH services as relevant markets for the CCI’s review.
This is the second major deal to be completed in the DTH sector, following Tata Sons’ acquisition of Singaporean investment firm Temasek's 10% holding in Tata Play for $100 million at a $1-billion valuation. Tata Sons now owns a 70% stake in Tata Play, with Walt Disney holding the rest.
Bharti Airtel acquired Lion Meadow’s 20% stake in Bharti Telemedia in February 2021 for Rs 3,126 crore through issuance of 36.47 million equity shares of Airtel at Rs 600 per share and up to Rs 1,037.8 crore in cash.
The stake acquisition, which will increase Bharti
Airtel
’s shareholding in Bharti Telemedia to 100% from 80%, valued the DTH firm at Rs 15,630 crore.
Bharti Telemedia, which provides DTH services under the Airtel Digital TV brand, had 16.1 million subscribers at the end of December 2023. It is the country’s second-largest DTH operator after Tata Play, which has 21 million subscribers.
The Warburg Pincus affiliate exited Bharti Telemedia in less than four years after acquiring a 20% stake in it for Rs 2,258 crore in December 2017, valuing the
DTH arm
at Rs 11,290 crore.
In FY23, Bharti Telemedia slipped into the red with a net loss of Rs 349 crore against a profit of Rs 465 crore in the previous year. The company’s revenue dropped 7% to Rs 2,949 crore.
While reaffirming the firm’s credit ratings, Crisil noted that Bharti Telemedia has made provision of around Rs 2,980 crore towards potential DTH licence fee liabilities, which are currently sub-judice.
The rating agency also noted that Bharti Telemedia’s liquidity remains strong, with cash and liquid investment at over Rs 250 crore as of March 31, 2023. It expects net cash accrual from operations to remain healthy at Rs 1,500–2,000 crore per annum over the medium term.

Financial angle
The videos include her speaking with Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde, as well as BJP ministers Piyush Goyal and Smriti Irani. In January 2023, Jani uploaded a brunch podcast with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during the Rajasthan leg of his Bharat Jodo Yatra that had gained a lot of traction at the time. Today, it’s become common for
top influencers
to interview political leaders of regional as well as national parties.
The monetary rewards for this kind of collaboration aren’t much, said agency heads.
“Some creators have been offered cash via third-party agencies facilitating podcasts for less-prominent political leaders. But most creators are doing this for access and recognition in the political corridors. Money is incidental for them,” said Talha Rashid, a Delhi-based political consultant and researcher.
Leading finance-focused creators, or ‘finfluencers,’ are being offered Rs 10-12 lakh to promote the schemes proposed by various political parties, typically through multiple videos released over a few days or weeks, one of them told ET on condition of anonymity. Such creators tend to make about 25% more on regular
brand collaborations
, depending on their stature, but in terms of eyeballs, it’s a lucrative proposition.
“Top influencers in areas like travel and tech are being offered money to indirectly promote cultural and digital offerings of a particular party, without disclosing that the video is a paid promotion,” the finfluencer said.
But “a tech influencer with the same views on a video is likely to earn four times what one can earn on a video on political content,” said Akash Banerjee, known for his YouTube channel on political and social satire, called The Deshbhakt. “Typically, most ads are served on tech content, then entertainment, education, and so on. Politics is way down the pecking order.”
Importantly, though, brands are now willing to purchase ad inventory associated with political content online, a practice they have traditionally been known to avoid.
“A decade ago, brands did not want to associate with political or religious conversations,” said Rashid. “We’re now seeing a trend where brands are getting less hesitant to associate with political narratives.”
While there’s still reluctance to collaborate with creators who only make political content, brands are flexible to, say, sponsor a tech or travel creator who is indirectly shaping a political narrative.
Instead of a blanket ban on being seen alongside political content, brands are now said to be evaluating it on the PINI scale — ‘positive influence, negative influence’ — said the head of an influencer analytics firm. “Anything that aligns with a nation-building narrative, for instance, is labelled as patriotic and safe to associate with,” this person said.
To critique or not?
Some creators said they turned down
political collaboration
offers. “They want you to avoid criticism, but also insist on constant promotional posts, even if they're not relevant to your audience or don't align with your content focus,” said the finfluencer cited above.
Creators tackling critical political topics often struggle to monetise their content.
“Only a few top creators producing critical political content get sponsors and those are also limited in number,” said ‘The Deshbhakt’ Banerjee. “Brands in categories like audio streaming or VPN recognise that our content appeals to discerning individuals that are likely to purchase their products.”
The Deshbhakt YouTube channel boasts over 4.2 million subscribers. Banerjee said brands usually ask creators like him to be softer in their criticism for videos they are sponsoring, often asking him not to name important politicians.
Additionally, ads served on political content are far fewer and cheaper due to supply-demand of ad inventory. Google allows advertisers to block their ads from appearing on sensitive content categories, including a specific exclusion for content related to politics or news.
The cost per thousand impressions varies across countries. India tends to have significantly lower digital ad rates, compared with mature digital markets like the US.
Banerjee said creators putting out content critical of political parties and their actions also tend to face ‘demonetisation’ issues (where the platform does not allow the content to generate ad revenue), which limits their earnings. “Two years ago, 21 of my videos were demonetised in a row,” he recalled.
There have been instances of newsfluencers receiving notifications from YouTube about their videos, especially those related to electronic voting machines, being demonetised.
“Creators who wish to monetise their content with ads must abide by our advertiser-friendly content guidelines,” a YouTube spokesperson told ET by email. “These policies are global and are designed to help maintain our brand safety and suitability standards. We apply them consistently to all creators, regardless of their political viewpoint, position or affiliation.”
Selling online courses and member-only subscription plans are alternatives but unsustainable avenues of earning income for creators who continue to make critical content on political parties.
However, Banerjee said that though there will be many more creators of political content over the next few weeks, it’s likely to peter out after the election verdict, at which point creators may struggle to retain their audience.

Paramount Global exited Reliance's Viacom18 with attractive returns: Top executive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/paramount-global-exited-reliances-viacom18-with-attractive-returns-top-executive/articleshow/109747729.cms,01-05-2024,"Paramount Global
’s sale of its 13.01% stake in
Viacom18
to
Reliance Industries
(
RIL
) has provided the company with an opportunity to exit the Indian joint venture (JV) with an attractive return on investment, a top company executive said.
Paramount
fully exited Viacom18 last month after selling its remaining 13.01% stake to RIL for ₹4,286 crore ($517 million). The company will continue to licence its content to Viacom18.
Its Paramount+
streaming service
is available on Viacom18’s JioCinema as a content block under the premium subscription tier. Viacom18 will continue to operate TV channels under Paramount-owned brands like MTV, Vh1 and Nickelodeon.
“Selling our stake in Viacom18 provided an opportunity to exit our ownership position with an attractive financial return on our investment while preserving our ability to monetise our content in India through ongoing licensing arrangements,” Paramount Global CFO Naveen Chopra told analysts during the company’s Q1 earnings call.
He also said that the after-tax proceeds will further benefit leverage when the transaction closes at the end of 2024 or early 2025, subject to regulatory approval.

The RIL-Paramount transaction is subject to the closure of the merger agreement between RIL, Walt Disney’s Star India and Viacom18.
Last year, Paramount saw its stake in Viacom18 get diluted to 13.01% following a ₹15,145 crore fund infusion by RIL and Bodhi Tree Systems. Subsequently, Viacom18 became a subsidiary of RIL with Bodhi Tree also holding a16% stake.
The company’s stake got diluted since it didn’t want to infuse growth capital into Viacom18 for investments in sports and digital businesses. Before the fund infusion, the American entertainment company held a 49% stake in Viacom18.
Paramount realised a non-cash gain of $168 million from the dilution of a 36% stake in Viacom18.
In February, RIL, Disney and Viacom18 decided to merge Viacom18 into Star India to create a $8.5 billion media giant. RIL and its subsidiary Viacom18 will own a 63% stake in the proposed merged entity, while Disney will hold the rest.

Graphic India partners Neil Gaiman to produce animated film 'Cinnamon',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/graphic-india-partners-neil-gaiman-to-produce-animated-film-cinnamon/articleshow/109648000.cms,27-04-2024,"Graphic India
, the leader in original Indian-themed character entertainment, and
Neil Gaiman
are partnering on a new English-language animated film, '
Cinnamon
'.
Gaiman is the NYT best-selling author and creator of films and series including, Coraline (Academy Award Nominee, Best Animated Feature), The Sandman, American Gods, and Good Omens.
Based on a short story written by Gaiman, the screenplay is being adapted by
Gaiman
and leading Indian animation writer and creator, Sharad Devarajan (The Legend of Hanuman; Baahubali: The Lost Legends) with Sarena Khan and Sujatha SV. The film will be directed by acclaimed Indian animator, Jeevan J. Kang.
Born with pearl eyes that render her blind to the physical world, Cinnamon’s destiny is shaped forever when a mysterious talking tiger appears. Offering to lead her through the wonders and trials of the wild, Cinnamon begins a perilous adventure that will shape her path and test her resolve. She enters a hidden realm where the line between the mundane and the mystical is as thin as a whisper and where the ancient wisdom of India breathes life into a jungle thrumming with secrets.
“Together, we are crafting a film that will transport audiences to a world of magic, wonder, and eternal truths, a story that celebrates the transformative power of compassion and the resilience of the human spirit. I cannot wait to share this incredible journey with animation fans around the world, old and new,"" commented Neil Gaiman.
Live Events
“Neil Gaiman is one of the greatest storytellers of our time if not all time. I am honored to bring his enchanting story of Cinnamon to audiences around the world. Inspired by Indian fables, Cinnamon weaves together the timeless theme of dharma as a young princess embarks on a journey of courage and self-discovery. At its core, it explores the universal human experience of the eternal struggle between light and darkness,” added writer and producer, Sharad Devarajan.
Previously at Graphic India, Devarajan and Kang created and produced (with Kang directing) the animated hit, The Legend of Hanuman which broke records as the most successful animated project in Indian history and reached #1 on the charts for Disney+Hotstar when it was released.
Producers for the film are Neil Gaiman and Cat Mihos for The Blank Corporation and Sharad Devarajan, Sarena Khan and Jeevan J. Kang producing for Graphic India, which is also the production studio animating the project and India’s leading animation studio of original content.

JioCinema Premium: Billionaire Ambani is asking for less than ₹1/day for his latest disruption,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/jiocinema-plans-billionaire-ambani-is-asking-for-less-than-1/day-for-his-latest-disruption/articleshow/109585803.cms,26-04-2024,"Reliance
Jio has introduced
JioCinema
Premium, its latest subscription offering that aims to redefine the streaming experience for users across India. Starting at an affordable rate of Rs 29 per month,
JioCinema Premium
promises an ad-free viewing experience with content delivered in up to 4K quality, along with the option for offline viewing.
Mukesh Ambani
's JioCinema, which largely bulked up in the last one-and-half-years with popular content addition for kids to adults and streaming of the cash-rich Indian Premier League, has already stepped up the content fight with rivals Netflix, Amazon or Disney Hotstar. It, in fact, also showed Indians how freemiums work after offering all content for free, but with ads. That model was soon taken up by some other OTT players, including Disney Hotstar (which will come under Reliance's roof subject to regulatory clearences), as it streamed the ICC World Cup for free on handheld devices.
Ambani is now asking for less than a rupee per day for premium content, a move that is seen to be another
disruptor for the subscription video-on-demand market
with such dirt-cheap pricing on a platform that streams IPL and Game of Thrones, besides almost all cartoons that kids love.
JioCinema's affordable push for larger audience
By making premium entertainment accessible at affordable rates, JioCinema aims to attract a wider audience and solidify its position as a leading player in the streaming space.

The pricing move also comes as a strategic response to the evolving demands of consumers and the competitive landscape of the streaming industry.
Analysts at Elara Securities have observed that JioCinema's decision to slash prices for its premium offering reflects several strategic considerations.
4 reasons why JioCinema dropped the bill
Firstly, the company aims to expand its subscriber base by offering a more comprehensive content library beyond exclusive Hollywood content that may not have seen a big offtake, Elara said.
Secondly, leveraging its robust distribution network in-house via Jio (mobile, fibre), JioCinema can bypass the need for partner tie-ups, giving it a competitive advantage over its peers, Elara said.
Thirdly, by catering to the premium segment of users who value ad-free content, JioCinema aims to bolster its revenue streams and drive scale in its pay-based revenue model. Finally, this move positions JioCinema to gain a competitive edge against global OTT platforms operating in the Indian market.
The aggressive pricing strategy is a testament to JioCinema's commitment to democratising access to premium entertainment for every Indian household. Moreover, the decision to offer live sports and catch-up broadcast content for free underscores JioCinema's dedication to providing a diverse range of content to its users.
Will IPL/sports be free on JioCinema?
According to Karan Taurani, an analyst at Elara, sports content will remain free on JioCinema, indicating a continued reliance on advertising revenue to support sports programming. While this may result in a slight negative impact on sports advertising expenditure on television, there are potential opportunities for growth in the future.
Following the merger of RIL and Disney, pending regulatory approvals, there may be the possibility of bundling sports content on TV and digital platforms, which could lead to increased overall advertising revenue, Taurani said.
Sports content has the potential to capture a larger share of the digital advertising market due to its availability for free, currently accounting for only 6-8% of India's digital ad spends. Additionally, catch-up TV content will also remain free on JioCinema, supported by advertisements. It is estimated that catch-up TV content forms a significant portion of JioCinema's non-sports content viewership, the analyst said.
Kiran Mani, CEO of Viacom18 Digital, said the new offering breaks down barriers to accessing premium content, with features like 4K streaming, best-in-class audio, offline viewing, and no device restrictions. This customer-centric approach reflects JioCinema's commitment to delivering an unparalleled entertainment experience to users across the country.
JioCinema raises bar for other OTTs
With an extensive content library featuring top-tier titles from Hollywood studios like Peacock, HBO, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery, JioCinema Premium offers a diverse array of entertainment options in multiple languages. This strategic move not only enhances JioCinema's competitive position but also raises the bar for streaming services in India.
As the streaming market in India continues to grow rapidly, JioCinema's disruptive pricing strategy may further reshape the industry landscape and drive further consolidation among players.
By offering premium entertainment at enviable rates, JioCinema is poised to capture a significant share of the market and emerge as a dominant player in the streaming space.
India is a price-conscious market that had earlier forced Netflix to cut prices to make inroads, while there are several regional OTTs that command a good subscriber base as they attract the local cinema-going fandom.
Elara noted, on average, broadcaster-based OTT platforms in India charge around Rs 103 per month (such as Zee5, Sony Liv, and Disney Plus premium plans), while global OTT giants charge around Rs 358 (like Netflix premium plan and Amazon Video). This indicates that JioCinema Premium's pricing offers a significant discount of 86% compared to the average price of its peers.
""However, Jio Cinema’s depth of offerings in originals/global content remains much lower compared to global peers,"" Taurani said.
India's OTT video market, which accrued $3 billion in revenue in 2022, is anticipated to more than double to nearly $7 billion by 2027, according to Media Partners Asia.
To be sure, streaming in India remains a capital-intensive venture due to substantial content expenses along with hurdles in monetisation. India, known for its price-sensitive market, records the lowest average revenue per user (ARPU) at $7.2, as highlighted by RBSA Advisors. Consequently, monetising through subscriptions presents a formidable challenge.

TV distributors bet on bundling to arrest churn,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tv-distributors-bet-on-bundling-to-arrest-churn/articleshow/109541593.cms,24-04-2024,"TV broadcast distribution companies are bundling traditional and digital services to arrest subscriber churn with platform-agnostic
content consumption
and on-demand viewing getting more prevalent, say industry executives.
Having lost customers to over-the-top (OTT) platforms, traditional TV distribution platforms are looking at bundled services to retain customers. In 2023, the
domestic pay TV industry
lost two million customers, according to a Ficci-EY report.
Telecom operators
Bharti Airtel
and Reliance Jio have been bundling data and content for several years. Among standalone players, DTH company Tata Play has been bundling linear TV and OTT offerings for subscribers through a single billing.
Airtel is offering a combination of direct-to-home (DTH), broadband, and OTT through the Airtel Black plan, while Jio has been providing linear TV and OTT through wired broadband service, JioFiber. In fact, Airtel Black has helped the Bharti Airtel-owned DTH platform, Airtel Digital TV, build customer stickiness. ""Today 25% of our DTH acquisitions are happening through the converged plans,""
Bharti Airtel
CEO Gopal Vittal said during the company's Q3 earnings call.
Dish TV
has also launched an integrated bouquet that offers both linear TV and OTT content to consumers for the same price. The move is part of the company's strategy to stem customer churn and save capex on new customer acquisitions.
Live Events
""We felt that there is a need gap in the market to provide a bundled offering to customers who want one subscription for both TV and OTT content,"" said Dish TV CEO Manoj Dobhal. He added that the initiative will help the DTH company retain subscribers amid increasing churn in the industry.
""Our capex will come down if we manage to retain subscribers because of this initiative. It will also help us acquire new customers,"" Dobhal said. Cable TV operator
GTPL Hathway
is bundling cable TV services with broadband to retain customers. Both DTH and cable TV service providers are facing 0.5-1% customer churn every month. During its Q4 earnings call, GTPL Hathway chief strategy officer Piyush Pankaj said the company's overarching strategy involves the convergence of both cable TV and broadband services to provide holistic bundles to subscribers. He also added that the company is adding other services such as gaming, OTT, and TV to offer a holistic offering to subscribers.
""This will not only help improve customer stickiness, thereby reducing the churn but will also help us increase our ARPU and thus improve our margins,"" Pankaj said.

NCLT admits Indiabulls Housing Finance insolvency plea against Subhash Chandra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/nclt-admits-indiabulls-housing-finance-insolvency-plea-against-subhash-chandra/articleshow/109509796.cms,22-04-2024,"The
bankruptcy court
has admitted
Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd
's (IHFL) application to initiate
insolvency resolution
proceedings against
Essel Group
chairman Subhash Chandra for default by a company called
Vivek Infracon
. Chandra was a
personal guarantor
against the loans availed by the company.
The New Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) presided by judicial member
Ashok Kumar Bhardwaj
and technical member Subrata Kumar Dash, while admitting the application, also appointed a resolution professional (
RP
) to ascertain the claims of lenders and personal assets of Chandra. The detailed order was not uploaded until the time of filing the story.
ET Bureau
The tribunal has also disposed of applications filed by IDBI Trusteeship and
Axis Bank
that sought to intervene in the matter.
In this case,
Indiabulls Housing Finance
had moved an application to initiate personal insolvency against Chandra in 2022 after a loan of Rs 170 crore it had given to Vivek Infracon had turned into non-performing assets (NPA).
""The copy of the order is awaited. Appropriate steps will be actioned in accordance with the applicable law,"" said a spokesperson from Subhash Chandra's office.
Live Events
Sanket Jain, partner at Pioneer Legal, said that this admission could have significant implications for Subhash Chandra.
""Beyond potential damage to his financial reputation, there may be personal and professional repercussions. He may have to undergo the insolvency resolution process, which could involve liquidating his assets to repay his debts or restructuring his liabilities under the supervision of the RP and the NCLT,"" said Jain.
""As for other lenders, the admission of the insolvency plea means that they will be included in the insolvency proceedings as creditors. They will have the opportunity to present their claims and participate in the resolution process to recover the amounts owed to them by Subhash Chandra, who acted as a personal guarantor,"" he added.
The development comes at a time when Chandra is also fighting a case against the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in the Bombay High Court. He has filed a writ in court challenging a summon issued to him in connection with an ongoing investigation by the market regulator.
In 2021, Chandra had claimed he had settled 90% of the debt with 43 lenders.

Subhash Chandra
, following a plea filed by
Indiabulls Housing Finance
. The decision, announced by a two-member bench in Delhi, comes in response to Chandra's role as a guarantor for a loan extended to Essel group firm Vivek Infracon Ltd.
The NCLT's directive focuses on initiating personal insolvency proceedings against Subhash Chandra, who serves as the Chairman Emeritus of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL).
Vivek Infracon, a subsidiary of the Essel Group, defaulted on a payment of approximately Rs 170 crore in 2022, prompting
Indiabulls Housing

While Indiabulls Housing Finance's plea was upheld by the NCLT, similar requests from two other creditors, IDBI Trusteeship and
Axis Bank

The order was pronounced during the open court session, yet a comprehensive judgment detailing the rationale behind the decision is still awaited.

Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHFL) had moved NCLT after Vivek Infracon had in 2022 defaulted a payment of around Rs 170 crore. Vivek Infracon is a part of Essel Group promoted by Chandra.
How the case unfolded
Though some settlement talks had taken place, no payment was made to IHFL.
The matter which was admitted in NCLT on Monday was the case of personal insolvency against Chandra under Section 95 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
After initiation of the insolvency proceedings, Chandra would come under the moratorium provisions of the IBC and would not be allowed to sell, dispose or alienate any property or assets.
A Resolution Professional would be appointed by the insolvency tribunal, who would collate all the loans and help the financial creditors recover their money.
Earlier, Chandra had contended that a personal guarantor cannot be liable for insolvency proceedings and the NCLT has no powers to initiate the process against him.
However, this was rejected by the NCLT in May 2022 and the tribunal held that it has the jurisdiction and authority to adjudicate personal insolvency proceedings.
Subsequently, this was challenged by Chandra before the appellate tribunal NCLAT. However, the matter was withdrawn as parties decided to settle the matter amicably.
However, the issue was revived again by IHFL earlier this year as the settlement with Chandra did not materialise.
In 2019, the government amended the provisions of IBC, allowing the creditors to file insolvency proceedings against personal guarantors.
This provision was challenged in the Supreme Court and the apex court in November 2023 upheld the validity of these provisions.

He also highlighted that the logo change was part of a broader upgrade, which included improvements in lighting and equipment. The move reflects Doordarshan's efforts to modernize and stay relevant in the changing
media landscape
.
Historical Significance
Doordarshan's logo has undergone several changes since its inception in 1959. Initially featuring a saffron logo, the colors were later changed to blue, yellow, and red. The current logo retains its iconic two petals with a globe in the center but has removed the words ""Satyam Shivam Sundaram."" The recent change to saffron has reignited discussions about the broadcaster's identity and role in Indian media.
Doordarshan's logo color change has sparked a heated debate, with critics questioning the broadcaster's impartiality and political neutrality. While the channel maintains that the change is part of a visual upgrade, critics like Jawhar Sircar argue that it represents a deeper shift in the broadcaster's ethos.
In another recent development, the Centre has mandated that Doordarshan news anchors wear Khadi outfits. This decision, made last month, follows a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between India's Public Service Broadcaster, Prasar Bharati, and
Khadi India
in September 2023.
Under the MOU, anchors of DD News and DD India are expected to promote India's rich heritage and modernity by wearing Khadi clothing. Additionally, Doordarshan has announced that it will live telecast the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol daily, further showcasing its commitment to cultural and traditional values.

How Murdoch partner is helping Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani build a media empire,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/how-murdoch-partner-is-helping-asias-richest-man-mukesh-ambani-build-a-media-empire/articleshow/109360592.cms,17-04-2024,"On a breezy April evening some 45,000 Indian Premier League cricket fans are packed into Wankhede Stadium to watch the hometown Mumbai Indians battle the Rajasthan Royals.
Elsewhere in the city, hundreds of employees of
Viacom18 Media Pvt
. are on different mission, transmitting the match in 12 languages and 20 camera angles across the world’s most-populous country.
“We are targeting over 600 million people to come and watch,” said
Uday Shankar
, the executive behind the effort.
Once an underdog dwarfed by foreign behemoths, Viacom18 and its JioCinema streaming service are poised to become the most powerful player in the $28 billion Indian media and entertainment industry.
Reliance Industries Ltd
., Viacom18’s largest shareholder, has plans to merge the business with Walt
Disney
Co.’s India operations, adding dozens of cable TV channels and tens of millions of streaming subscribers in a deal valuing the combined enterprise at $8.5 billion.
With everything from local news to big Hollywood films, the new company aims to capture not just a bigger share of TV ad sales, but the growing digital revenue now going to tech giants like YouTube and Meta Platforms Inc. Viacom18 could also become a broader rival to Amazon.com Inc. if it follows through on plans to integrate e-commerce into its streaming platform.
Live Events
Shankar, the 61-year-old executive who’s going to lead Viacom18 as vice chairman, is a media veteran. A former journalist, he helped turn Star India into a prized asset for the
Murdoch
family, which then sold their entertainment assets to Disney in 2019. Now he’s overseeing the group buying back that business. His role as a bridge between Hollywood and Bollywood will make him a key player in the media strategy being implemented by Reliance, a company with interests from energy to telecommunications.
“He’s one of the most talented media executives in the world, not just in India,” said James Murdoch, who partnered with Shankar in Bodhi Tree Systems, an investment firm that owns a piece of Viacom18. “Uday has a great track record of being able to move businesses forward, and we’re excited to see it continue.”

James Murdoch
India isn’t a market where others have been able to move forward so easily, despite the country’s economic growth.
Disney, for example, acquired a large business there when it bought 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets in 2019. But pricey bidding wars for cricket rights and a paltry $1.28-a-month in revenue per streaming subscriber has made profitability hard to come by. In a bid to bulk up,
Sony Group
sought to merge its Indian business with local rival Zee Entertainment, only to see the deal fall apart earlier this year.
With the backing of
Mukesh Ambani
, Reliance’s chairman and Asia’s richest person, Shankar thinks he can achieve a different outcome, building a profitable streaming business in large part by offering ad-supported programing. It helps, he said, that he was born and raised in the country.
“India is like a continent,” he said in an interview at his office in the southern port area of Mumbai. “Many people have come in and found it difficult to build a big business, but for us, we are from India.”
Among his boldest bets, letting cricket fans stream the premier league for free on JioCinema, a move that attracted 449 million viewers and more than 17 billion views last season. Shankar is offering free
IPL
live streaming again this year.
The goal is to develop the market for mobile streaming in India and particularly the associated advertising, since most of the company’s customers subscribe to the ad-supported version. Digital ad revenue will come not only from the English- and Hindi-speaking population, but also from regions that have their own languages and purchasing habits.
Sports streams garnered 70% of their viewership from small towns last year, and most of viewers were in the 18-to-44-year-old demographic most coveted by advertisers, according to a report from the consulting firm EY. And while advertising in India’s $4 billion traditional TV market is shrinking, the digital advertising market is projected to more than double to about $20 billion in the next five years, Shankar said.
“You need to make sure that digital offerings are available to smallest of the small advertisers,” he said. “That’s the model that we believe in.”
All of this takes work of course. Back at Viacom18’s newly opened production hub, engineers in a massive control room monitor screens on multiple platforms to spot glitches and fix them in seconds. Separate screens receive live feeds of viewer consumption. On top of the studios, a giant data center supports the video feeds, all part of Shankar’s obsession with the product.
“He spent 80% of the time on tech just to ensure that we have a service which doesn’t crash,” said Prateek Garg, managing director at Marigold Park Capital, an affiliate of Bodhi Tree.
Growing up in a small rural town in India, Shankar studied economic history with a goal of learning how to influence Indian society. He found journalism the closest answer to his career goal and joined the Times of India as a political reporter. He later became one of the founding editors of New Delhi-based environmental magazine, Down to Earth. In 1991, he was shocked by CNN’s live broadcasting of the first Gulf War.
“It blew my mind,” Shankar said. “My wife got frustrated with my obsession with TV and told me, ‘Instead of watching it, why don’t you go and do something?’”
He managed to get his first TV job at a network and spent more than four years building a 24-hour live news channel called Aaj Tak before joining the Murdoch family’s Star News as chief executive officer in 2004.
“One thing I knew as a journalist was I knew who was a good expert and how to go to that person to ask the right questions,” Shankar said.
The journalism skills helped him turn around Star News, and his work stood out. In 2007, he took over as CEO of Star India, the choice of Chairman Rupert Murdoch to the lead the company’s entire operation in that country.
“He gave me the license to make mistakes because I was untested,” Shankar said. The corporate DNA of Fox was “go create the market and then you make money in the market.”
India was just beginning to roll out 3G wireless service and had almost no Wi-Fi or broadband access. Shankar’s team started building a streaming platform called Hotstar and he went to every telecom company, begging for partnerships.
“They all rejected the idea and it was one of the most humiliating experiences I’ve ever had,” he said.
The efforts finally paid off after Hotstar offered the International Cricket Council World Cup for free in 2015, with a catchphrase “get over TV.”
It was a beginning of a digital revolution, with Ambani’s
Reliance
Jio telecom business launching 4G service with free data plans. The two Indian businessmen teamed up to jointly market Hotstar and Reliance Jio, which has since become the largest wireless carrier in India with 471 million subscribers.
Shankar rose to president of 21st Century Fox’s Asia business in 2017, overseeing all of the company’s operations in the region. By the time Fox sold its assets to Disney two years later, Star India’s value had soared to around $15 billion. Disney CEO Bob Iger gave Shankar the top job in Asia, leading the launch of its Disney+ streaming service in the region.
Shankar felt more comfortable in an entrepreneurial setting and joined James Murdoch, his old boss at Star India, to form Bodhi Tree. They raised $1.5 billion from the Qatar Investment Authority and others to invest in media deals including Viacom18 and an education technology startup.
Under Shankar’s guidance, JioCinema has been licensing films and TV programing from major Hollywood studios including Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal and
Paramount Global
, which is selling its 13% stake in Viacom18 to Reliance.
Disney’s lucrative library will be soon onboard with the merger. The new company will have more than 100 TV channels and two streaming services, capturing about 35% of India’s total TV viewership and 45% of the premium video-streaming business, excluding YouTube and Facebook.
It’s not just movies and TV coming from Disney. The merged entity will also have IPL rights, along with the TV and digital rights to the International Cricket Council’s Cricket World Cup, part of a package of sports that will cost about $2 billion annually, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Bloomberg
Premium video platforms' revenue shares including ads, subscription in 2023
The research firm Media Partners Asia estimated that the combined businesses lost about $200 million on sales of $2.8 billion in the fiscal year ended in March. Profitability in the traditional TV entertainment business was overtaken by the red ink in sports and streaming.
“The overall business will be loss-making but if you bring the combined cost structure together, they’ll have more synergies and bargaining power,” said Media Partners founder Vivek Couto. The digital advertising revenue will continue to grow along with the growth of India’s economy over the next five years. “After the hard work’s done, let’s say in 12 to 24 months, they should become a pretty profitable scale business,” he said.
Besides capturing multilanguage sub markets, JioCinema aims to build its business around the cricket experience, starting with selling mobile emoji packs featuring IPL cricket stars. It’s a first step to getting consumers accustomed to digital wallets, Marigold executive Garg said. Viacom18 hired Google veteran Kiran Mani to build out the mobile business.
Its content strategy is opposite that of Amazon and Netflix, which pump out big-budget series in India. Shankar’s strategy is to produce inexpensive 30-minute soap operas every day to capture the audience and boost the number of daily active users, a key metric in digital advertising. Eventually, that online viewing will replace traditional TV.
“I’m a big believer in change,” Shankar said. “Sometimes it can be unnerving, it can be difficult, but eventually, I believe it leads all of us to a better place.”

Zee withdraws NCLT plea in Sony merger case,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-withdraws-nclt-plea-in-sony-merger-case/articleshow/109355082.cms,17-04-2024,"ZEE
Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) has withdrawn its application from the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) that sought directions to
Sony
Group Corp-owned
Culver Max
Entertainment and
Bangla Entertainment
to implement the composite scheme of arrangement between the three companies.
In an official statement issued late on Monday evening, the company said it has withdrawn the implementation application based on the advice received by the board after a detailed consultation with legal experts.
Sony and Zee had signed definitive agreements on December 21, 2021 to merge their businesses.
ZEEL had filed the application on January 24 after Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment---both India units of Sony Group--terminated the merger agreement on January 22 over an alleged breach of the merger cooperation agreement (MCA), putting an end to the multi-billion-dollar merger deal that had been in the making for more than two years.
Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment had also filed applications in the NCLT challenging the validity of ZEEL and its shareholder Mad Men Film's merger implementation applications.

Lawyers tracking the development said Mad Men Film's application will become infructuous due to ZEEL's withdrawal of the application from the NCLT.
ZEEL also said that the withdrawal of the merger implementation application will allow it to pursue its claims against Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and other forums.
While terminating the merger agreement, Sony's India entities had initiated arbitration proceedings against ZEEL before SIAC and had sought $90 million in termination fees from the Indian entertainment major for alleged breach of the merger cooperation agreement (MCA).
The company also said that the decision will allow it to pursue growth and evaluate strategic opportunities to generate higher value for all shareholders.
“This was expected, given the fact that Sony had already filed several applications informing NCLT that it did not wish to continue with the merger,” said Ashish K. Singh, managing partner, Capstone Legal. “To my understanding, SIAC Arbitration is an independent adjudication, and this withdrawal will not affect it in any way.”
Elara Capital’s senior vice president Karan Taurani said, ""This move may pave the way for a new strategic partner in the company, as this plea would have obstructed talks of any new potential partner.""
Sony's decision to call off the deal set off a chain reaction--ZEEL's share price fell by 33% to a 52-week low of Rs 152.5 on January 23, compelling the company to take drastic measures to return to the growth path after four years of declining profits and muted revenue growth.
In recent weeks, ZEEL has been on an aggressive cost-cutting spree to achieve its target of 18–20% EBITDA margin by FY26. The company has decided to lay off 15% of its more than 4,500 employees.
The company has also seen the top-level exits of Rahul Johri (president-business), Punit Misra (president-content), and Nitin Mittal (president-technology).
""The immediate priority for the company is to focus on performance and achieve its targeted goals for the future. We have reviewed the key steps taken by the management over the last few months that are result-oriented, and we believe that the company is well poised to chart a stronger growth trajectory,"" said ZEEL chairman R Gopalan.
""Hence, after seeking an independent legal opinion, the Board has advised the management of the company to withdraw the implementation application filed before the Hon’ble NCLT. The Board remains focused towards maximising shareholder value, strengthening the company’s claims in arbitration, and enabling the company to explore strategic opportunities.”
In an interview with ET on March 4, ZEEL’s chief executive Punit Goenka had said that the merger deal with Sony is in the past and the company is firming up strategy as a standalone entity.
""I’ve always believed in living in the present and focusing on the future. What's in the past is in the past. So, it’s time to shift our focus to the journey ahead,"" he said. Goenka also said that the merger implementation application simply states that the grounds for termination are incorrect.

In the 2022 edition of the tournament, the broadcaster sought ad rates of around Rs 9–10 lakh from both sponsors and spot buyers, respectively.
Its important to note that negotiated ad rates are typically lower than the card rate.
According to a report by TAM Media, ad volumes per match during the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 witnessed a decline of 47% compared to the ICC T20 World Cup 2021.
The company declined to provide any comment until press time.
The broadcaster which had secured India media rights with a winning bid of $3 billion for the 2024–27 cycle is seeking outlays of over Rs 60 crore from co-presenting sponsors for both standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) channels.
On a standalone basis, SD and HD channels have outlays exceeding Rs 45 crore and Rs 25 crore, respectively.
In the case of an associate sponsor, the outlay is over Rs 40 crore across SD and HD channels. The outlays for SD and HD channels individually are over Rs 30 crore and Rs 15 crore, respectively.
The spot-buy rates for packages featuring India and knockout games range between Rs 13 and Rs 26 lakh per 10-second spot.
Disney+ Hotstar, which will livestream the tournament, is seeking higher sponsorship outlays compared to TV. The streamer has asked co-presenting, powered-by, and associate sponsors to fork out Rs 80 crore, Rs 55 crore, and Rs 30 crore, respectively.
The streaming company is seeking spot rates of Rs 13 lakh per 10 seconds for mobile and Rs 6.5 lakh per 10 seconds for connected TV (CTV). For just India matches, the 10-second rate goes up to Rs 35 lakh and Rs 18 lakh on mobile and CTV, respectively.
The live mid-roll cost-per-thousand-impression (CPM) rates for the entire tournament are Rs 230 and Rs 500 per 10 seconds for India and play-off matches. For CTV, the CPM rates are Rs 480 and Rs 1050 per 10 seconds for the entire tournament and India matches, respectively.
Comparatively, the Indian Premier League (IPL) commands much higher ad rates than the ICC T20 World Cup. Disney Star, the official IPL TV partner, was seeking outlays of Rs 80–160 crore for co-presenting sponsorship and Rs 35–70 crore for associate sponsorship for the ongoing edition of the tournament.
JioCinema, the official streamer of the IPL, was seeking a CPM of Rs 200 for a 10-second midroll and preroll mobile video ad. The ad rate for live matches on mobile is Rs 16 lakh for 10 seconds. For connected TV (CTV), the 10-second ad rate for a live match is Rs 6.5 lakh.

Delhi HC accepts Reliance Ent's profit sharing undertaking for Netflix film 'Amar Singh Chamkila',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/delhi-hc-accepts-reliance-ents-profit-sharing-undertaking-for-netflix-film-amar-singh-chamkila/articleshow/109170495.cms,09-04-2024,"The Delhi High Court has accepted
Reliance Entertainment Studios
’ undertaking to share 50% of its profit from the upcoming Netflix film ""
Amar Singh Chamkila
"" with Super Cassettes Industries (SCI) that operates music label and film production house T-Series.
""Amar Singh Chamkila"", a biopic of the slain Punjabi singer, features Diljit Dosanjh in the titular role, and has been directed by Imtiaz Ali.
To provide a practical resolution to the enforcement of the lien or charge,
Reliance
had offered an undertaking – the commitment includes the deposit of a fixed commission of 2% from the licensing fee, to be deducted from the final tranche Reliance receives from Netflix, and 50% of the profits generated by the film Amar Singh Chamkila, Justice
Sanjeev Narula
said in his order last week.
“These measures reflect an equitable approach to reconciling the interests of all parties involved and ensuring compliance with the contractual and legal frameworks governing the relationships between SCI, Reliance, Netflix and WSF,” he added.
""The above undertaking is accepted and shall bind the defendant (Reliance Entertainment), who shall deposit the aforesaid amounts with the Registrar General of this court as and when the same are received by them,"" according to the judgement.

The single judge noted that the films ""Section 84"" and ""
Singham Again
"" have been produced by other entities, such as Film Hangar LLP and Rohit Shetty Picturez LLP, where Reliance is only a partner. ""These productions are also then in collaboration, where the reasoning given above would apply,"" it held.
The HC said that “it is untenable for SCI to assert that revenues generated from the
Netflix Reliance Agreement
– executed under the
License Agreement
between WSF and Reliance – constitute revenues in Reliance’s possession over which, SCI can legitimately claim a lien or charge. Given the complexities inherent in distinguishing between gross revenues and direct profits accruing to Reliance, the court finds that SCI’s lien or charge, under the current circumstances pertaining to the film in question, is more appropriately enforceable over the net profits of Reliance, rather than the gross revenues.”
Super Cassettes had extended a loan of Rs 268 crore to Reliance for production of 11 Hindi cinematographic films. Reliance allegedly having defaulted in repayment of dues led SCI to filing of a recovery suit for Rs 60.23 crore that became due as on November 16. Thus, SCI had asserted a lien and charge over any future films that
Reliance Entertainment
planned to produce, either independently or in collaboration with others.
In November, Reliance had assured the HC that it would refrain from releasing any cinematographic films or transferring any rights related to such films for a two-week period. However, SCI moved the HC alleging that the
Ambani
firm was planning to release five films.
While SCI had sought to stall the release of ""Amar Singh Chamkila,"" it later specifically demanded the deposit of Rs 42.16 crore which Reliance received from Los Gatos Production Services India LLP, an affiliate of Netflix Inc.

Zee to cut workforce by 15% to reduce costs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-to-cut-workforce-by-15-to-reduce-costs/articleshow/109074087.cms,06-04-2024,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(Zee) has initiated the process of slashing its workforce by 15% across functions as it looks to optimise costs and achieve its target of 20% EBITDA margin in 2025-26, the company said in a statement.
The move is likely to impact nearly 700 employees, as the company employed 4,577 people as of March 31, 2023. In 2022-23, its employee benefit expenses stood at ₹675 crore.
Zee
had recently fired 50% of its staff at the Technology & Innovation Centre (TIC) in
Bengaluru
. The company, which incurred an expenditure of ₹600 crore on
TIC
, aims to cut down its expenses by 50%.
The corporate rejig has also seen the exit of three top-level executives - Rahul Johri (president, business),
Punit Misra
(president, content) and
Nitin Mittal
(president, technology).
The job cuts and the top-level exits come at a time when Zee managing director
Punit Goenka
has taken a more hands-on approach following the collapse of the merger deal with
Sony Pictures Networks
India.
Live Events
Under the new structure, both the revenue and content teams will report directly to
Goenka
following the exit of Johri and Misra. On an interim basis, TIC executives will report to Amit Goenka, president-technology, since the company's streaming platform, ZEE5, is a major user of technology services.
The company said Goenka has also proposed the elevation of certain team members across businesses to provide them with a higher level of responsibility.
ZEEL chairman
R Gopalan
said the board has noted the steps being taken by Goenka to streamline the organisation and the proposed lean structure. ""While the board is in the process of discussing the same, the proposed structure certainly is in line with the strategic guidance provided to the management,"" he said.

Reflecting on the fiscal gone by, he said FY24 ""showed our true resilience and teamwork"".
""Tackling challenges head-on made us even stronger, thanks to our solid commitment to leadership and core values,"" he wrote.
The experiences and lessons from FY24 are stepping stones for what lies ahead, Singh said.
In January this year, Sony had pulled out from the proposed USD 10 billion merger with ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd citing failure to meet certain ""closing conditions"" by the Indian firm. The deal collapsed after over two years of announcing it.
Subsequently, the two parties are now locked in legal battles.

It's Pune office alone employs 1500 people mostly related to digital and
AI
expertise.
""Last year our headcount probably grew 10-15%. We have kind of the same growth projections going forward for the next 2-3 years,"" Peeters said.
""India is not the kind of an offshore centre or something like that; but it is an integral part of our organization,"" he added.
Peeters said India has the third highest publication output, behind China and US.
""Out of 2.5 million articles, I think India has 300,000 articles. It is quite a significant volume,"" Peeters said.
In India 80% of the research is funded by the government.
Peeters flags research integrity including the problem of paper mills as a key concern plaguing Indian academic output.
Paper mills are illegal organisations that sell authorships on bogus papers to researchers trying to pad their CVs.
""If people publish results as a survey, and have not received consent from the participants, that is a research integrity issue. I would call that a kind of innocent research integrity issue. People have interpreted the numbers in a wrong way, or those things can happen. What becomes more problematic is when we have integrity by design, that we are basically called paper mills -- researchers steal the identity of other researchers and basically create fake manuscripts,"" Peeters said.
""Given the pressure on researchers to publish to keep their tenure or profession, they need to publish a certain number of papers, given the limitation of time - they are willing to buy authorship of a paper,"" Peeters explains.
Peeters says more integrity issues are coming from not just India but newer economies.
""We, as research publishers, have to monitor research integrity, but at the same time academic institutes need to do their role in educating and training their researchers,"" Peeters said.
""China has really taken the issue to heart. Academic institutes in China take responsibility for research integrity themselves. If you are an author -- the consequence of (lack of research integrity) can be very severe (there),"" Peeters said.
Peeters said Springer is embracing technology and artificial intelligence in publishing to protect research integrity and improve publication process.
""AI is being a great opportunity to help in improving the publication process -- using AI to detect manipulated images, we use AI to find peer reviewers, editors, use AI to help authors to improve manuscripts, we also use AI to create summaries of articles. We believe that generative AI has a lot of potential for the industry,"" Peeters said.
""It also explains why we have a large workforce in Pune,"" Peeters said.
With $1.9 billion in sales, Springer Nature is the second largest
research publisher
in the world that owns high impact academic publishing brands including Springer, Nature Portfolio, BMC, Palgrave Macmillan, and Scientific American. On an average every year it publishes about 400,000 articles and around 13,000 books.

ET’s queries emailed to DCI remained unanswered till press time.
In 2022, WarnerMedia’s India unit was merged with DCI following Discovery Communications’ $43 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. from AT&T. Discovery and WarnerMedia were subsequently combined to form Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).
WBD has cancelled plans to launch HBO Max (which is now known as Max) in India, licensing content to JioCinema for a $20 million annual fee. The HBO content was earlier licensed to Disney+ Hotstar.
Arjun Nohwar, previously the APAC regional general manager for Uber's SaaS business, is at the helm of Discovery Communications India.
Discovery Channel Mauritius is the holding company of DCI, a private company with unlimited liability. Warner Bros. Discovery is DCI’s ultimate holding company.
The company distributes TV and digital channels owned by Discovery Network Asia Pacific and Warner Media India in India and other SAARC countries.

OTT content aggregator YuppTV had the highest engagement after YouTube, with 2.7x the engagement of the next closest competitor was MX Player (179.4 minutes).
YouTube is followed by Disney+ Hotstar with 114 million UVs, JioCinema (101 million), and MX Player (93 million). Disney+ Hotstar had an average of 177.8 minutes per visitor, while JioCinema had 69.7 minutes.
ZEE5 ranked fifth with 57 million UVs, followed by Prime Video with 45 million and Netflix with 42 million, while
Jio TV

ZEE5 outperformed Netflix in terms of average minutes spent per visitor at 90 minutes, compared to the latter's 83.9 minutes.
Comscore said the competition between Hotstar and
Jio Cinema
was being fought using live sports as the primary hook. It added that the 2023 IPL helped Jio Cinema reach a peak of 151 million UVs, while the ICC CWC helped Hotstar reach a peak of 191 million UVs in November 2023.
The Comscore report noted that the potential merger between Star India and Viacom18 will lead to a one-stop-shop for most sporting events for Indian viewers. Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema will have a consolidated reach of 160 million UVs.
It was noted that Zee5 and SonyLIV are utilising their entertainment content IP to attract viewers.
Barring Prime Video and ZEE5, most platforms, including JioCinema, Disney+ Hotstar, and Netflix, had over 60% male users, with MX Players having the highest composition of male users.

Red-hot OTT market likely to enter consolidation phase,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/indias-ott-market-ripe-for-consolidation/articleshow/108829296.cms,28-03-2024,"Mumbai:
India
's booming
streaming
market, which includes more than 50 over-the-top (OTT) video entertainment platforms, is ripe for consolidation as large players look for new growth opportunities and smaller ones crave for fresh funds to survive, say industry experts.
Despite incurring losses, deeppocketed OTT platforms are continuing operations due to regular fund injections from their parent companies, while smaller rivals are at risk of going out of business due to high capital requirements for content, marketing, and user acquisition, they said.
The small OTT platforms are hence facing two options: get acquired by larger platforms or shut shop due to growing losses as expenses continue to outpace revenues.
Zee Entertainment
chief Punit Goenka said consolidation in the
OTT industry
has to happen since the market can accommodate only a certain number of players.
As per Media Partners Asia, India's OTT video market, which generated $3 billion in 2022, is projected to more than double to nearly $7 billion by 2027.
Live Events
“An average subscriber is subscribing to 2.5 OTTs, so from that perspective, consolidation has to happen. It will be either consolidation or some platforms will have to shut shop,” Goenka told ETin a recent interview.
Streaming in India continues to be acash-guzzling business due to high content costs coupled with monetisation challenges. India is a price-sensitive market featuring the lowest average revenue per user (ARPU) of $7.2, according to RBSA Advisors, making monetisation through subscriptions a challenging task.
Though OTT platforms have made progress in monetising through advertising, YouTube continues to be the dominant player in the ₹13,000-crore digital video ad market.
The merger of Star India and Viacom18 will make the proposed merged entity a powerful force to be reckoned with in the OTT industry, with two strong platforms in Disney+ Hotstar andDeep-pocketed OTT platforms are surviving despite losses due to regular fund injections from their parent cos JioCinema with 333 million and 95 million monthly active users, respectively, for Q4 2023, according to Sensor Tower.
People privy to the developments said South Indian streaming platform AHA is scouting for funds as it needs investments to grow the business. The company has held talks with multiple parties but hasn't been able to any headway so far.
Despite recording strong growth, Bengali OTT platform Hoichoi has seen its networth erode due to accumulated losses of up to ₹28 crore, as of March 2023. Balaji Telefilms-owned ALTT and Eros International-owned Eros Now have scaled down their operations due to intense competition.
Big OTT platforms continue to struggle with profitability. ZEE5 had recorded cumulative losses of over ₹800 crore in 9M FY24. Novi Digital Entertainment, which owns Disney+ Hotstar, incurred a ₹748crore loss in FY23.
Media industry expert Rajesh Sethi believes that consolidation will create a smarter content ecosystem and provide hyperscale revenue opportunities, leading to sustainable profitability.
“Most OTT platforms are unprofitable, despite their widespread adop tion and borderless consumption. The streaming industry will be shaped by consolidation to achieve competitive scale and efficiency. OTT platforms desirous of a national play will need to provide content in 8 to 10 languages, and each language will further require multiple pieces of fresh content across films and series, which can be achieved by consolidation,” said Sethi.
According to Studio Mojo founder and CEO Radhakrishnan Ramachandran, the Indian
OTT market
will witness consolidation since smaller players will find it difficult to match up to the financial might of Disney+ Hotstar-JioCinema, Netflix, and
Prime Video
in the new competitive scenario.
“The OTT industry, in addition to mergers and acquisitions, may attract Indian and foreign strategic investors who are keenly monitoring the OTT space,” said Ramachandran, who is the founder of the Malayalam OTT platform Koode.
Hoichoi' co-founder Vishnu Mohta said consolidation is already the larger theme in the media & entertainment sector, particularly with the recently announced Star-Viacom18 merger and the now-aborted Sony-Zee merger.
""Post-Covid, many smaller OTT platforms launched since streaming was seen as the hot sector. However, OTT is not an easy business to be in since you have to provide fresh and original content at regular intervals to subscribers, which is an expensive proposition. That, combined with the funding winter, has taken a toll on many platforms,"" Mohta said.

""Apart from the three cricket boards that we currently have, we are also evaluating a couple of other cricket rights that will become available. We will be prudent while bidding for cricket properties,"" Kaul told ET.
The Asian Cricket Council's media rights deal with Star India has expired, and the property is expected to come up for bid this year.

The NZC deal marks the second major sports rights acquisition by the company after the collapse of the merger deal with
Zee Entertainment
in January.
Last month, it inked a $40 million deal to acquire exclusive media rights to the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Conference League. In October last year, it bagged UEFA Euro 2024 and 2028 media rights for $48 million.
The company has been maintaining fiscal prudence while bidding for expensive properties like IPL and ICC media rights. It lost out the BCCI media rights to Viacom18 by a small margin.
NZC chief executive Scott Weenink said that the deal with SPNI, unlike Amazon, includes both TV and digital. ""Sony will own the digital rights on a non-exclusive basis for the first few years since Amazon Prime Video also holds the digital rights until 2026,"" he added.
In 2020, e-commerce giant Amazon made its live sports debut in India by acquiring exclusive streaming rights to NZC for the Indian market. Prior to Prime Video, the NZC rights were held by Star India.
Kaul noted that timing will not be an issue since NZC will push the timing of Test matches to suit Indian audiences. ""As far as the ODIs and T20s are concerned, those are night games in New Zealand and day games here in India. They have also promised us weekend games,"" he added.
He also stated that the viewership of top-quality non-Indian cricket has been on the rise.

"Broadband, OTT may keep Tata Play in good stead amid DTH dip",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/broadband-ott-may-keep-tata-play-in-good-stead-amid-dth-dip/articleshow/108771823.cms,26-03-2024,"Tata Play
's revenue from the core direct-to-home (
DTH
) business is predicted to decrease in the medium term due to moderation in its subscriber base. Still, this decline is anticipated to be offset by growth in broadband and over-the-top (OTT) businesses.
According to a report by Crisil, the company's operating margins may face pressure in fiscal 2024 and 2025 due to moderation in the DTH subscriber base, partially offset by OTT aggregator Tata Play Binge's improved metrics and
Tata Play Broadband
's expected breakeven.
The company's DTH subscriber base decreased in September 2023 compared to September 2022 due to competition from DD Free Dish and OTT platforms.
The company is backed by
Tata Sons
, Walt Disney, and Temasek.
Tata Play's subscriber market share decreased from 33% in September 2022 to 32.43%, while the industry subscriber base decreased from 65.58 million to 64.18 million, according to TRAI data.
Live Events
The company's consolidated revenue declined 5% to Rs 4,499 crore in FY23 due to a fall in DTH revenues. However, the de-growth in DTH was partially offset by higher revenues from Tata Play Broadband and Tata Play Binge.
EBITDA
decreased 30% to Rs 1,361 crore due to revenue decline and higher deferred equipment cost recognition.
In FY21, the company changed its accounting treatment about expenditure on customer premises equipment costs from the entrustment model (capital expenditure) to the sale model (operating expenditure), which impacted its EBITDA.
The rating agency has reaffirmed the DTH company's bank facilities worth Rs 8,000 crore due to its healthy business risk profile driven by its market leadership in the DTH segment.
Crisil said Tata Play is expected to deploy most of its planned capex going forward towards the broadband business, which will be managed prudently.
Tata Play has infused equity of Rs 455 crore and Rs 209 crore in FY22 and FY23, respectively, in Tata Play Broadband. In FY23, the broadband business saw a 49% increase in revenue to Rs 260 crore, while its net loss narrowed by 16% to Rs 124 crore.
The rating agency stated that Tata Play Broadband operates in seven cities, but due to its limited presence, subscriber growth is expected to moderate with higher churn and lower gross additions.
Tata Play Broadband had 473,013 subscribers as of September 30, 2023.
Tata Play has allocated Rs 1109 crore towards disputed licence fee liabilities and recognised Rs 1958 crore as a contingent liability for the fiscal year ending March 2023.
As of December 31, 2023, Tata Play had Rs 296 crore in cash and equivalents, while its broadband business had an outstanding debt of Rs 64 crore.

What happened when India pulled the plug on TikTok,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/what-happened-when-india-pulled-the-plug-on-tiktok/articleshow/108695395.cms,22-03-2024,"In India, a country of 1.4 billion, it took
TikTok
just a few years to build an audience of 200 million users.
India
was its biggest market. Then, on June 29, 2020, the
Indian government
banned TikTok, along with 58 other
Chinese apps
, after a simmering conflict between India and China flared into violence at their border.
A popular form of entertainment, which had not been the subject of political debate, vanished overnight. Now, as politicians are wrangling in Washington over a plan that could shut access for the 170 million Americans using TikTok, the example set by India gives a foretaste of what may come -- and how audiences and other
social media companies
catering to them might respond.
TikTok, owned by
ByteDance
in Beijing, came to India early, establishing a wide base in 2017 in dozens of the country's languages. Its content -- short videos -- tended to be homey and hyperlocal. An endless scroll of homemade productions, many of them shot in small towns or farms and set to popular music, helped while away the hours across the world's cheapest and fastest-growing mobile-data network. As it has in the United States, TikTok became a platform for entrepreneurial extroverts to build businesses.
Veer Sharma was 26 when the music stopped. He had collected 7 million followers on TikTok, where he posted videos of himself and friends lip-syncing and joking around to Hindi film songs. He was the son of a laid-off millworker from the central Indian city of Indore and barely finished formal schooling. His TikTok achievements filled him with pride. He felt ""beyond happy"" when people recognized him on the street.
They were happy to see him, too. Once, Sharma said, an ""elderly couple met me and said they would watch my show before going to bed, for a laugh."" They told him that his ""show was a way out of their daily life's drudgery.""
Live Events
With his new stardom, Sharma was earning 100,000 rupees (about $1,200) a month. He bought a Mercedes. After the ban in 2020, he barely had time to make one last video for his fans. ""Our times together will be ending soon, and I don't know how or when we will be able to meet again,"" he told them.
""Then, I cried and cried,"" he said.
Yet short videos, including many preserved from TikTok and uploaded to other sites that aren't banned, continue to draw Indians.
India's online life soon adapted to TikTok's absence.
Meta
's Instagram swooped in with its Reels and Alphabet's YouTube with Shorts, both TikTok-like products, and converted many of the influencers and eyeballs that had been left idle.
The services were popular. But something was lost along the way, experts said. Much of the homespun charm of Indian TikTok never found a new home. It became harder for small-time creators to be discovered.
Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy analyst in New Delhi, tracks the overall change to the departure from TikTok's ""algorithms, its special sauce,"" which was ""a lot more localized to
Indian content
"" than the formulas used by the
American giants
that succeeded it.
Several Indian companies tried to get into the gap caused by the disappearance of Chinese competition. But America's tech giants, with their deeper pockets and expanding global audiences, came to dominate India. The country is now the biggest market for both YouTube (almost 500 million monthly users) and Instagram (362 million), with roughly twice as many users as either has in the United States.
The decision by India to cut its population off from TikTok was as sudden as the U.S. efforts, which began in 2020, are protracted. But the motivation was similar -- and even more dramatic. Whereas the United States and China are engaged in a new kind of cold war over economic dominance, India and China have had troops standing off at their border since 1962. In 2020, that frozen conflict turned hot. In one night of brutal hand-to-hand combat, 20 Indian soldiers were killed, along with at least four Chinese, which China never officially confirmed.
Two weeks later, India switched off TikTok. The app disappeared from Google and Apple stores, and its website was blocked. By then, India was well practiced in blocking objectionable websites and even shutting down mobile data across whole regions, in the name of maintaining public order.
There were few other signs of retaliation by India, but this one action commanded the public's attention. The list of Chinese apps that India has banned continues to grow, now to 509, according to Pahwa.
Until then, India's internet had presented an open market to China. In contrast to India's domestic media companies, tech startups were free to take investment from China and other countries. TikTok was only the most popular among dozens of Chinese-owned games and services distributed to Indians online.
Since at least 2017, after a similar border skirmish, the possibility that Chinese consumer technology might pose a risk to India's sovereignty had been circulating in national security circles.
Indian officials had expressed concern that Chinese-owned apps could provide Beijing with a potent messaging tool within India's raucous media environment. Just two months before the ban, India announced new restrictions on investments from any country ""sharing land border with India."" Technically, that would apply to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan. But China was understood to be the real target.
On June 29, 2020, the official order that blocked TikTok and dozens of lesser-known Chinese services did not mention China explicitly, nor the bloody fight on the border. Instead, the measure was described as a matter of ""data security and safeguarding the privacy"" of Indian citizens from ""elements hostile to national security and defense of India.""
In subsequent years, India's government has used the rationale about maintaining the ""safety and sovereignty of
Indian cyberspace
"" to dictate terms even to U.S. tech companies. It has complained to Apple and Twitter, as well as to Meta and Google, sometimes to prevent speech that is critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party.
But the government bore no grudge against TikTok's influencers. After the ban went into effect, the BJP reached out to Sharma, who said he had become depressed. Between losing his income and his fame, he felt his ""world crashing down."" He had already been contacted by Moj, a Bangalore-based TikTok rival. Sharma's career and income bounced back after he posted a clip with his state's chief minister and started making promotional videos with other BJP officeholders. He feels proud now to be helping further Modi's political agenda.
Another TikTokker who was temporarily ""heartbroken"" by the ban was Ulhas Kamathe, a 44-year-old dad from Mumbai. He somehow achieved a moment of international fame by devouring chicken platters while murmuring ""chicken leg piece"" with his mouth full, an instant meme. After losing his nearly 7 million TikTok followers overnight, he says he has recovered -- by finding 5 million on YouTube, 4 million on Instagram and 3 million on Facebook.
""In the past three years, I have rebuilt without any help -- all by myself,"" he said.

MIB advises social media influencers to avoid promoting betting ads,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/mib-advises-social-media-influencers-to-avoid-promoting-betting-ads/articleshow/108685183.cms,21-03-2024,"The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) has advised
social media
endorsers and
influencers
to avoid showing promotional content or advertisements of offshore
online betting
and gambling platforms in any form.
In an advisory issued on Thursday, the ministry advised online ad intermediaries not to publish such content targeting an Indian audience and social media intermediaries to educate their users against publishing such content.
The advisory has been issued before the commencement of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 on March 22.
The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) issued an advisory on March 6, raising concerns about celebrity endorsements of offshore online betting and gambling platforms, citing the widespread illegality of such activities and the guidelines for preventing misleading advertisements and endorsements in 2022.
Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000, allows intermediaries to be exempt from liability for third-party information, data, or communication links. However, this exemption does not apply if the intermediary fails to remove or disable access to the material without vitiating evidence.

The MIB, which has the authority to clamp down on betting ads, has also warned that failure to comply with the above may lead to proceedings under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.
All India Gaming Federation CEO Roland Landers lauded the ministry for issuing the advisory. ""We hope that the latest advisory will deter the celebrities from engaging with these anti-national and illegal platforms, which are a danger to India's economic and social security.""
He added that the advisory will help distinguish legitimate Indian online gaming operators offering player protection from illegal sites, reducing consumer harm and problems.

Star Sports
, the official broadcaster of
Indian Premier League
, on Thursday in an industry-first move announced a partnership to launch
targeted advertising
on linear TV, specifically during
live sports broadcasts
, starting from this

season.
The partnership aims to provide advertisers access to premium audiences in the top eight metro cities of India. The advertisers can specifically target their ads during live
IPL matches
on Star Sports channels, the companies said in a release.
“Addressable Ads capability for unconnected boxes is a groundbreaking global first in Pay TV that will be introduced for the first time on live sports during Tata IPL,"" said Harit Nagpal, Managing Director & CEO, Tata Play.
Tata Play in December 2023 had
rolled out addressable ads for linear television
, a 'breakthrough' in the Indian industry for unconnected boxes and a move that should propel revenues of the dish tv provider who never had access to advertising revenue.
Addressable ads allow brands to target segmented audiences with same TV ad spots. In simple terms, broadcasters can choose which ads to play for which audience of varied regions and income groups.
Live Events
The addressable ads allow advertisers to better target city markets to make their brands more visible. Also, for advertisers aiming at customers across India, this service improves their existing plans by helping them target specific areas in big cities better.
""The convergence of the largest DTH provider and the biggest TV network presents a significant advantage for advertisers,” said Ajit Varghese, Head – Network Advertising Sales at Disney Star.
This new service is for all kinds of advertisers, including big brands in areas like fast food, online services, travel, consumer products, and others.

The media rights income, along with sponsorship revenue from the central revenue pool, is shared equally between the BCCI and the franchisees.
Of the franchisee share, 45% is divided equally among the IPL teams, while the remaining 5% is distributed based on their rankings during a season.
The media rights deal has dramatically improved the profitability of the original IPL franchise holders. However, the two new teams, Ahmedabad and Lucknow, will have to wait a few more years to become profitable because of their high acquisition cost.
Singh said the Gujarat Titans' sponsorship revenue is expected to increase 24% from last year to touch Rs 90 crore this season from the 27 sponsors and partners.
""In 2023, we had a 38% increase in sponsorship revenue. This year, we are looking at a 24% increase. We are well into the Rs 90 crore range,"" he added.
The team has two new sponsors,
Dream11
and Lubi Pumps. Dream11 has replaced Ather Energy as the title sponsor, while Lubi Pumps has replaced Timex. ""Most of our existing sponsors continue their deals this year at an enhanced value,"" Singh said.
Gujarat Titans has 8 million fans across various platforms and two million direct fans who have shared credentials with the franchisee. ""We are engaging our core fans through the Gujarat Titans app with user-generated content and live-streaming,"" he added.
Gujarat Titans looks at merchandising as an engagement tool rather than a revenue stream, Singh said. ""Merchandising is a difficult revenue stream to build in India due to counterfeiting,"" he said.
CVC Capital Partners
has no plans to buy teams in other T20 cricket leagues since the focus is to grow the Gujarat Titans franchisee and make it profitable. ""We had discussed a couple of options. However, our focus is entirely on the Gujarat Titans,"" Singh said.

Paramount, which owns media brands like MTV, Vh1, and Nickelodeon, will continue to license its content to Viacom18. It has launched its streaming platform Paramount+ as a bundled service on Viacom18's streaming platform JioCinema.
Viacom18 is a subsidiary of
TV18 Broadcast
, which is in the process of merging with Network18.
Paramount Global (formerly Viacom), which had formed Viacom18 as an equal joint venture (JV) with TV18 in 2007, has been ceding control of the company to RIL after the latter's acquisition of Network18 from Raghav Bahl.
In 2018, RIL took control of Viacom18 by acquiring an additional 1% stake from Paramount for a cash consideration of $20 million to take its stake to 51%.
Paramount's stake in Viacom18 declined to 13.01% from 49% last year following a ₹15,145-crore fund infusion by RIL and Bodhi Tree Systems.
The fund infusion gave RIL-owned entities a 60.37% shareholding in Viacom 18, with Bodhi Tree Systems receiving 13.08%. Subsequently, Bodhi Tree hiked its stake in Viacom18 by purchasing an additional 2.89% stake from RIL for ₹953.23 crore.
Paramount Global had realised a non-cash gain of $168 million for the quarter ended June from the dilution of its stake in Viacom18, the company's regulatory filings show.
The stake acquisition by RIL comes close on the heels of the joint venture (JV) deal between RIL and Disney to merge Viacom18 into Star India, a company owned by the American media conglomerate.

Delhi High Court denies Bloomberg relief against order to take down 'defamatory' article against Zee,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/delhi-high-court-denies-bloomberg-relief-against-order-to-take-down-defamatory-article-against-zee/articleshow/108498897.cms,14-03-2024,"The
Delhi High Court
on Thursday dismissed international
media
group Bloomberg's
appeal
against a lower court
order
directing it to take down an allegedly
defamatory
news
article
against Zee Entertainment. Justice Shalinder Kaur said there was no ground to interfere with the ex-parte interim order passed by the Additional District Judge (ADJ) on the
lawsuit
by
Zee Entertainment
Enterprises Limited over the article published on February 21, and ordered
Bloomberg
to comply with the direction in three days.
""A reading of the impugned order suggests that the learned ADJ applied his mind to the facts of this case and satisfied himself that prima facie there was enough material to come to the conclusion for the purpose of granting an ex-parte ad-interim injunction, otherwise the entire purpose of filing the application would have been rendered infructuous,"" said Justice Kaur in the order.
""I, thus, do not find any ground to interfere with the order impugned herein. Consequently, the appeal along with pending applications, stands dismissed,"" opined the judge.
The high
court
observed there was no final adjudication on the subject matter at this stage as the ADJ was yet to hear Bloomberg.
The media organisation rushed to the high court without exploring the option of filing a reply to the application on interim relief or filing a plea for modification of the ex-parte ad-interim order, it said.

Noting that the matter has been fixed for hearing on March 26, the high court said in case of any urgency, the parties are at liberty to approach the ADJ for an early hearing.
""It is clarified that the appellants have to comply with the directions of learned ADJ vide order dated 01.03.2024 within three days from today,"" the high court ordered.
On March 1, the ADJ had directed Bloomberg to take down the allegedly defamatory article within a week, saying Zee had established a ""prima facie case for passing ad-interim ex-parte orders of injunction"".
The ADJ had said the balance of convenience is in Zee's favour and irreparable loss and injury might be caused to the company if the injunction was not granted.
The appellant contended before the high court that the lawsuit was intended to intimidate and silence their right to free and fair speech.
It was also claimed that the ADJ did not give the portal an opportunity to place before it several other articles published prior in time and was denied a right to establish their case.

has agreed to buy
Paramount Global
's entire 13.01% stake in local entertainment network
Viacom 18 Media
for approximately Rs. 4,286 crore, RIL said in a regulatory filing.
""A binding agreement has been entered between Reliance and two subsidiaries of Paramount Global to acquire 13.01% equity stake (on a fully diluted basis) of Viacom 18 Media held by Paramount Global through its two subsidiaries for an aggregate consideration of Rs. 4,286 crore,"" the filing said.
After the completion of this transaction, Reliance's equity stake in Viacom18 will increase to 70.49% on a fully diluted basis.
At present, Reliance holds Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares of Viacom18, representing a 57.48% equity stake.

Comedy Central
,
Nickelodeon
, and
MTV
.

Paramount has affirmed its commitment to continue licensing its content to Viacom18 following the completion of the deal. Paramount's content is currently available for streaming on Reliance's JioCinema platform.
Furthermore, the completion of the transaction is contingent upon Reliance's previously disclosed merger with
Walt Disney
concerning their television and streaming media assets in India.
Reliance's Viacom18 Story
The chairman of Reliance Industries, a conglomerate spanning from retail to telecom, harbored ambitions of establishing India's largest media empire after gaining control of Network18 from its previous promoter, Raghav Bahl, in 2014.

Mouse in the house: How Disney-Reliance merger could put Jio’s 5G digital dreams on speed dial
As part of the Network18 acquisition, Viacom18 came under Reliance's umbrella. Reliance increased its stake in Viacom18 by acquiring an additional 1% from Paramount Global (formerly Viacom) in 2018.
Reliance
has long been mindful of Viacom18's comparatively smaller size compared to competitors like Star, Zee, and Sony. Initially pursuing expansion through a merger with Sony Pictures Entertainment's India unit, Reliance called off the proposed merger in 2020 due to disagreements over shareholding and valuation.
Following the failed Sony deal, Reliance explored merging Viacom18 with Zee. Although Invesco, then Zee's largest shareholder, supported the idea and sought changes to the Zee board, the Zee promoters rejected Reliance's offer and later pursued a deal with Sony, which also faltered in January 2024 after two years of negotiations.
Unable to strike deals with the second and third largest players, Reliance achieved success in its third attempt by acquiring the market leader, Star India. The merger between Star and Viacom18, finalized on February 28, will establish an $8.5 billion media powerhouse with a dominant presence in both television and digital segments.
Reliance-Disney merger
In February, Walt Disney Co and Reliance Industries announced a significant merger to combine their media operations in India, forming a formidable entity valued at Rs 70,000 crore. Under the agreement, Reliance and its affiliates will possess a majority stake of 63.16% in the merged company, which will encompass two streaming services and 120 television channels.
Meanwhile, Disney will retain the remaining 36.84%. Reliance has committed to injecting Rs 11,500 crore into the joint venture upon its closure, enhancing its competitive edge against rivals like Sony and Netflix. This infusion of capital will fortify the joint venture's position as the leader in the OTT subscriber base.
Nita Ambani will lead the joint venture established between Walt Disney and RIL, with Uday Shankar serving as vice chairperson. Uday Shankar, a former senior executive at Disney, also co-owns Bodhi Tree, a venture with James Murdoch.
This collaboration will position the joint venture as a premier platform for television and digital streaming services, offering a rich array of entertainment and sports content in India. It will consolidate renowned media assets encompassing entertainment channels such as Colors, StarPlus, and StarGOLD, as well as sports channels like Star Sports and Sports18.
Moreover, it will provide access to highly anticipated events through both traditional television broadcasting and digital platforms like JioCinema and Hotstar. With a projected viewership exceeding 750 million within India and extending services to the global Indian diaspora, the joint venture is poised to be a global entertainment powerhouse.
It also secures exclusive distribution rights for Disney films and productions in India, boasting a vast library of over 30,000 Disney content assets, thereby offering a comprehensive entertainment experience for Indian audiences.

Some of the issues put up for discussion include the promotion of
local content
, containing piracy and having a separate regulator for the broadcasting sector.
Lahoti also said
over-the-top
(OTT) video streaming will complement linear TV rather than replace it and will expand the overall video viewership pie.
""TV is neither dead nor going to die. Mobile is a 5-inch screen, and TV is a 50-inch screen. You can't have the same entertainment on mobile as TV. Mobile is not replacing, but augmenting TV. It is expanding the reach of TV, and it is also expanding the viewership,"" Lahoti said.
The Trai chairman also said that the regulator's job is to enable the orderly growth of the industry. He added Trai has to enable new players and technologies to come in by removing entry barriers.

The court's direction came over a suit filed by ZEEL against Bloomberg, in which it submitted that the article by Bloomberg has damaged its reputation.
Bloomberg had published an article titled ""India Regulator Uncovers $241 Million Accounting Issue at Zee"" which was ""defamatory"" and was published to malign its image.
ZEEL in a statement said it argued in front of the Court that the article published by Bloomberg was false and factually incorrect, with a pre-meditated and malafide intention to defame the Company.
""The article mentioned details pertaining to the corporate governance and business operations of ZEE, which were inaccurate in nature and led to a 15% drop in share price of the Company, eroding investor wealth.
The article by Bloomberg, incorrectly published that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has found a $241 million accounting issue at the Company; whereas there is no such order from the mentioned regulator,"" it said.
Despite the Company firmly refuting the same, the article incorrectly published financial irregularities in ZEE, without the basis of any order from the regulator, it said.
Passing a 4-page-long order, the city Court said: ""In my view, the plaintiff (ZEEL) has made out a prima facie case for passing ad interim ex-parte orders of injunction, balance of convenience is also in favour of plaintiff and against the defendant (Bloomberg) and irreparable loss and injury may be caused to the plaintiff, if the injunction as prayed for is not granted..""
""In view thereof, defendant no.1 and defendant no.2 are directed to take down the article dated 21.02.2024 (page 84 to 86 of the plaintiff's document) from online platform within one week of receipt of this order,"" it said.

"M&E sector has growth, employment intensity embedded in it: I&B secretary Sanjay Jaju",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/me-sector-has-growth-employment-intensity-embedded-in-it-ib-secretary-sanjay-jaju/articleshow/108243864.cms,05-03-2024,"Media & Entertainment (M&E) is a unique segment with growth and
employment intensity
embedded in it, and at the same time, it is a sunrise sector from the point of view of disruptions happening in the sector,
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
(MIB) secretary
Sanjay Jaju
said during his special address at the FICCI Frames 2024 in Mumbai.
India, Jaju said, is currently going through a phase of
digital transformation
, and the M&E sector is also witnessing rapid shifts that are happening with the availability of
online media content
.
Speaking about digital infrastructure, he noted that India has 90 crore internet users, over 60 crore smartphones, and over 4 crore connected TVs.
Jaju, a 1992-batch IAS officer, took charge as Secretary of the MIB on February 5, succeeding outgoing Secretary Apurva Chandra, who has been assigned the charge of Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
The I&B Secretary noted that the real shift in the M&E sector has happened in the OTT segment, with close to 60 OTT platforms, including regional ones. OTT, he said, is also drawing foreign investments because of the growth in content consumption on OTT.
Live Events
“The M&E sector is a chief contributor to India's soft power and India's ascendance among the comity of nations,"" stated the I&B Secretary.
Jaju listed down the initiatives being taken by the central and state governments to promote the M&E sector, like amendments to the Cinematograph Act, the Digital Media Ethics Code (Rules), and enhanced FDI limits in the broadcasting sector.
He also pointed out that the government has brought in a lot of reforms in the TV broadcasting sector, like uplinking and downlinking guidelines that ensure
ease of doing business
and ease of compliance.
Jaju said that the National Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, and Comics (AVGC) policy is now in its advanced stage and is a pivotal component of ""Create in India for the World"".
He assured that the AVGC policy, which has been drafted with inputs from industry stakeholders, will facilitate investment, foster innovation, ensure skill development, protect intellectual property, and help build world-class infrastructure.
The I&B secretary has also envisaged setting up a National Centre of Excellence for the AVGC and Extended Reality sectors, which will create a world-class talent pool for this segment and would also allow the setting up of incubation centres and provide guidance to the industry.
The government has also launched a scheme recently that provides incentives to foreign filmmakers for shooting in India. He said that India has signed co-production treaties with multiple countries to ensure that big-budget international films come to our country.
""This will not only bring in investments but create cross-country linkages and catapult us to showcase our soft power,"" he added.

CAGR
growth rate, reaching Rs 3.08 trillion by 2026, according to the FICC-EY Report 2024. The sector grew 8% in 2023, reaching Rs 2.32 trillion.
While the sector was 21% above its pre-pandemic levels, television, print, and radio still lagged their 2019 levels, the report added.
Digital media
is anticipated to overtake television in 2024 as the largest segment in the M&E sector. In 2023, all M&E segments grew except for television.
The
TV segment
fell by almost 2% to Rs 69,600 crore in 2023 vs. 2022 and is expected to grow by over 3% to reach Rs 71,800 crore in 2024. The segment is expected to touch revenues of Rs 76,500 crore by 2026.
The report stated that TV advertising fell 6.5% to Rs 29,700 crore in 2023 due to a slowdown in spending by gaming and D2C brands, which impacted revenues for premium properties. The Hindi market was also soft, resulting in a 3% overall ad volume decline.
Live Events
Subscription revenue increased to Rs 39,900 crore after three years of decline due to price increases, despite a two-million drop in pay TV homes. While linear viewership grew 2% over 2022, 19 to 20 million smart TVs connected to the internet each week, up from around 10 million in 2021.
The total number of TV homes stood at 163 million, including 118 million pay-TV homes and 45 million free-TV homes. The monthly connected TV base reached 30 to 35 million unique sets, with an estimated 19 million weekly connections.
Digital media revenue increased by 15% to Rs 65,400 crore, while digital advertising revenue reached Rs 57,600 crore, and digital subscriptions increased by over 8% to Rs 7800 crore.
The growth of digital advertising was led by e-commerce advertising and social media, with search and social media comprising 72% of total ad revenues.

Digital subscription revenue could grow at a 13% CAGR to reach Rs 11,400 crore in 2026. By 2026, paid video subscriptions are expected to reach 138 million across 65 million households due to the bundling of multiple services.
The print segment grew by 4% to Rs 26,000 crore in 2023 on the back of growth in advertising and subscription revenues. In 2023, ad volumes increased by 2%, while ad rates grew by 2.4%. The average insertion size also increased by 4% due to increased demand for premium inventory.
The print segment is projected to reach Rs 28,800 crore by 2026, with a 3.4% CAGR. Advertising growth is expected at 4.7% CAGR due to affluent audiences and premium inventory formats, while subscription growth is expected at 0.7% CAGR due to cover price increases.
The film segment grew 15% to reach an all-time high of Rs 19,700 crore. In 2023, there were 1,796 films released in theatres, an 11% increase from the previous year.
The screen count increased by 4% but remained at 9,742, indicating that cinema remains a luxury for most Indians. In 2023, cinema hall admissions decreased from 944 million to just over 900 million, a 5% decline, with less than 100 million people visiting the halls.
Domestic theatricals reached a record of Rs 12,000 crore for the first time, largely due to an increase in ticket prices. Indian films were released in 38 countries, a significant increase from 33 in the previous year.
The segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7% to Rs 23,800 crore by 2026, driven by rising affluence, improved mass content, and innovative pricing, infrastructure, and distribution strategies.
In 2023, the online gaming segment in India surpassed filmed entertainment as the fourth largest segment, growing by 22% to Rs 22,000 crore, and is projected to grow at a 21% CAGR to reach Rs 38,800 crore by 2026.
Online gamers in India reached 455 million in 2023, with a predicted increase to 491 million by 2024.

management team

Zee had earlier announced a merger with Sony Pictures Network India, which could have created a USD 10.5 billion media entity in the country. However, it was called off by the Sony Group in January, and both sides are now mired in litigation and arbitration.
According to Gopalan, ZEEL has a strong brand, market position, debt-free
balance sheet
and cash-generating business.
""ZEEL is a strategic asset and is well positioned in the Indian M&E landscape. ZEEL has not only been a pioneer in the industry but has also run very frugal operations, consistently beating deep-pocketed MNC players for several years,"" he said.
Last month, ZEEL reported a decline of 2.36 per cent to Rs 2,073.36 crore in its consolidated total income for the third quarter ended in December 2023.
On failure to merge with Sony, Gopalan said the ZEEL Board and management were fully committed to the completion of the merger, by undertaking several permanent and irreversible steps.
""Punit Goenka was also agreeable to step down in the interest of the merger. However, by its communication dated 22-Jan-2024, Sony unilaterally terminated the merger cooperation agreement and initiated legal proceedings,"" he said.
Terming Sony's unilateral move as ""premature"", Gopalan said ZEEL was engaged in good faith negotiations and was taking the required steps to ensure the merger scheme is implemented at the earliest.

Zee
board for a change in management following the failed merger with
Sony
and subsequent crash in share price, Zee Entertainment Enterprises managing director and chief executive
Punit Goenka
said in an interview in Mumbai.
In the midst of a comprehensive assessment of the business, Goenka told Vinod Mahanta & Javed Farooqui that any asset failing to generate profit will be divested from the media company’s portfolio. He also spoke of the challenges facing Zee after the merger failure, impact of the Reliance-Disney merger on the industry, Sebi’s allegations of fund diversion, and his ambitious turnaround plan. Edited excerpts.
Have you had any conversations with Sony after it terminated the deal?
No, we have had no conversation with Sony after termination of the deal. I’ve always believed in living in the present and focusing on the future. What’s in the past, is in the past. So, it’s time to shift our focus to the journey ahead.
Then why has Zee gone to National Company Law Tribunal seeking implementation of the merger scheme?
The application we’ve filed simply states that the grounds for termination are incorrect.
Therefore, it’s not our failure. NCLT has the jurisdiction to determine the validity of such a scheme.
Live Events
Has Sony filed an application before NCLT for withdrawal of the scheme?
Not that I am aware of. Till yesterday (March 2), nothing has been served to us.
Are you seeking a strategic or financial partner, now that the merger deal with Sony is over?
This is a very rich asset and I’m sure a lot of people will be interested in it. We are always open to dialogue, whether it be financial or strategic investors. Although I don’t think there are (many) strategic options left in the market but certainly, there are financial options.
However, the focus now is to ensure the company continues to deliver value to shareholders. I have committed publicly to my shareholders that in FY26, I will deliver an 18-20% Ebitda margin, which should roughly translate to over Rs 2,000 crore of Ebitda on a cash basis.
Have you held discussions with any financial investors?
No, we are not in active dialogue because we're still in the midst of NCLT proceedings. Our merger cooperation agreement restricts us from engaging with anyone else.
Do you have a sense of regret that after two years, the deal with Sony didn’t go through?
We had a promising deal with Sony, but for various reasons, it didn't materialise. Now, our sole focus and intention is directed towards our business. We’re a debt-free, cash-rich company, with over Rs 800 crore of cash on our balance sheet as of December 31. We’re generating positive Ebitda and cash flow, and we have a top-notch team capable of rebuilding the business.
How do you aim to achieve Rs 2,000 crore Ebitda by FY26?
We will achieve this target through three things — frugality, optimisation and sharp focus on quality — besides making sure that every decision is based on return on investment, which is the DNA and mantra that Zee has always lived by. We’ve had distractions in the last couple of years. Those distractions are over.
Have any of the financial investors asked the Zee board for a change in management?
While no one has approached us with such ideas yet, it’s crucial to remember that success speaks for itself. Those who deliver results will continue to be valuable to shareholders. Conversely, if one fails to deliver, changes may indeed be warranted at some point. Shareholders have every right to seek change if they lack faith in the management or the board.
To achieve the 18-20% Ebitda target, will you exit the sports business and cut down digital investments?
I’ll reiterate — I will chop off anything that doesn’t yield a return on investment. I have shut down more channels than I have launched in the last 20 years since I joined. I firmly believe that if it doesn't generate profit, it doesn't belong in our portfolio.
What will your future growth drivers be, considering broadcasting is not growing fast enough and streaming is still loss-making?
Streaming may currently be operating at a loss, but the losses are on a downward trajectory... It indicates a positive trend, suggesting that profits will likely follow suit. Additionally, we’re aiming for an 8-10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) on our revenues. This growth will be driven by a combination of factors, including digital and linear television advertising, as well as subscription revenue from both digital and traditional sources. The Ebitda target will be attained through a combination of revenue growth and cost management. We’re not assigning specific percentages to each aspect. Rather, our focus is solely on reaching this target figure. Additionally, we're concentrating on achieving growth in line with our objectives.
Does cost management mean layoffs and shutting down a few businesses?
In our industry, a 15-17% churn rate is typical, so natural attrition may play a role in this process as well. We need human capital to run this business. Optimisation of human capital is what is needed.
We’ll be evaluating certain businesses with a final lens, determining when and how they will be shut down. A part of those businesses were part of the merger scheme. However, some international businesses may be reconsidered because they were profitable and we had to shut them down due to the merger. There have been instances where we have lost $10-12 million of profits from those businesses.
How will the Reliance-Disney merger change competitive intensity of the sector and how will it impact Zee in particular?
Competition is always welcome in our industry. I firmly believe it brings out the best in us — whether it's in terms of our topline growth or profitability. Disruption isn't exclusive to anyone. If others can disrupt the market, so can we. No one has a copyright on innovation. I've always believed that it's better to fragment the market than get fragmented. If that means shaking up the market or adapting to new rules, we're prepared to do whatever it takes to remain competitive.
What is the status of the ICC television rights deal with Star as of today?
From my perspective, the contract with Star has effectively been terminated due to their actions. The agreement only required Star to telecast the semifinals and finals of the recently held under-19 World Cup. However, they chose to broadcast the entire series without our consent. Therefore, in my view, their actions have nullified the contract.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) lawyer has told the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) that Zee promoters are not cooperating in the probe related to fund diversion. Your comments?
I cannot speak (as) to what they said before SAT. However, I want to clarify that I am not at the beck and call of Sebi. While I am fully committed to cooperating with their requests, I must adhere to logistical constraints. If I am situated outside of India and summoned by Sebi, it's not feasible for me to appear immediately. I would need to return to the country first. We have diligently complied with Sebi's requests, submitting every document within the specified timelines. Additionally, we have formally requested extensions, when necessary. It's important to note that any assertions made by Sebi are based on their submissions, not mine.
What if Sebi, after investigating the fund diversion case, bars you from holding any key managerial position (KMP) in the company again?
If regulations dictate that I cannot continue at a KMP in the organisation, then I must accept that decision. Ultimately, if I am required to vacate my office and the seat on the board, it will be up to the shareholders to decide on the next steps, and who they wish to bring in as a leader.
What will the Goenka family’s plan be in case of an adverse Sebi decision?
Every promoter works on multiple plans, depending on the circumstances. There is nothing for me to say right now. We're awaiting the final order from the regulator to see what steps need to be taken.
It's worth noting that Sebi issued its confirmatory order in August 2023, and the matter has been challenged within SAT. SAT has set aside Sebi's order, stating that the findings were incorrect. This underscores the importance of ensuring evidence before making allegations. We're awaiting further developments and will act accordingly once the final order is issued.
Don't you think that the merger with Sony could have been salvaged if you had agreed to step down?
In my affidavit before NCLT, I stated that I was willing to vacate the chair, provided the regulation says that I had to vacate the chair. That's all I stated. I cannot compel Sony to retain me as an employee. If Sony had decided to proceed with the merger, they (would have) had the authority to close the deal and then request my departure shortly after. My stance was simple — I won't leave the organisation until the merger is completed. It’s a matter of responsibility to my shareholders. If I were to depart before the merger is concluded, it would leave shareholders in a vulnerable position. Therefore, my departure was contingent upon the successful completion of the merger.
How do you respond to Sebi’s allegations in a reply to SAT that the alleged fund diversion by Zee promoters could be as high as Rs 2,000 crore?
I don't know how to react to that because the board has done a full audit. My statutory auditors have given a report; we got a special audit done by Grant Thornton.
Sony has done due diligence on this company. But after that, four entities did not find anything wrong.
There has been no misappropriation of funds within the company. While we may have made some incorrect business decisions that resulted in financial losses, there has been no wrongdoing on our part. If certain businesses, such as Margo, have experienced losses, it’s due to legitimate business risks and decisions, not any fraudulent activities. I challenge anyone to provide evidence suggesting otherwise.
Has the promoter family started increasing its shareholding in the company?
I want to reiterate that my primary focus is on the business. The family's shareholding is their concern, not mine. Regardless of the changes in shareholding, my dedication to this company remains unwavering. Whether I own 46% or 4%, my passion for this business will remain the same.

Sony Pictures signs $40-million deal to renew rights for UEFA Leagues,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-pictures-signs-40-million-deal-to-renew-rights-for-uefa-leagues/articleshow/108186031.cms,04-03-2024,"Sony Pictures
Networks India (SPNI) has renewed its exclusive
media rights
for the UEFA
Champions League
, UEFA
Europa League
, and UEFA Conference League for an additional three seasons.
People familiar with the matter indicate that the three-year deal starting in 2024-25 and ending in 2026-27 could be valued at $40 million.
Both Sony and UEFA declined to comment.
As part of the deal, SPNI's Sony Sports Network will have exclusive TV broadcast and
digital rights
to about 1,600 matches featuring Real Madrid, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Liverpool.
The renewal builds on the extension of the UEFA Euro 2024 and 2028 media rights deal between the two companies in October last year. The UEFA Euro deal renewal was worth $48 million.
Live Events
UEFA marketing director Guy-Laurent Epstein said the partnership extension with SPNI will help grow the audience for its tournaments.
""We want to grow the footprint of European football in India, and Sony is a great partner to achieve that. Our sponsors are also keen to push the UEFA Champions League and other competitions in India because it's a massive economy in the making,"" Epstein told ET.
India ranks second in social media followers for UEFA, following Indonesia, he said. ""India counts as one of the biggest audiences we have on social media.""
SPNI head of sports business Rajesh Kaul said football is the most followed sport in India after cricket. ""While we have lost out on some cricket properties, we are acquiring all the premium football properties to make Sony Sports the home of Indian football,"" he said.
Apart from UEFA properties, SPNI is also the official broadcaster for the Bundesliga, Emirates FA Cup, and Roshn Saudi Pro League. ""Except for the EPL, we have the rest of the football properties with us,"" Kaul added.
He also said UEFA Champions League viewership in India has surged more than 51% since 2020, largely due to the introduction of regional language commentary.
Kaul said football is expanding its reach beyond the traditional markets of the Northeast, Kerala, and Goa. ""Football is gaining traction in key towns and cities across India,"" he said.
He further stated that SPNI will keep live sports behind the paywall on SonyLIV since that strategy has worked well for the company so far. ""Football has been a huge driver of subscription revenue for SPNI across linear and digital,"" he said.

The streaming video segment, which includes Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema, is expected to generate $800 million in revenue and a $150 million Ebitda loss.
According to MPA, Star India's entertainment business generates a substantial annual operating profit, but is expected to face substantial losses due to its $3 billion TV rights deal with the International Cricket Council and cancellation of a sub-licensing contract with
Zee Entertainment
.
Star India's sports business posted a wider operating loss of $432 million in FY23, compared with $237 million the previous year. Revenue for the year fell 39% to $729 million.
The combined entity will have numerous synergies available across TV and streaming after the deal closes in late 2024 or early 2025, pending regulatory approval, including from the Competition Commission of India.
According to MPA, the combined entity would capture 40% of the broadcast market and 45% of the streaming market, including subscription and premium ad-led streaming segments but excluding YouTube and Meta.
On February 28,
Reliance
and Disney signed binding agreements to merge Star and Viacom18, with Reliance and Viacom18 owning 63% of the merged entity and Disney holding the remaining 37%. Reliance will also inject $1.4 billion into the merged entity.

Viacom18-Star merger may face intense CCI scrutiny,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/viacom18-star-merger-may-face-intense-cci-scrutiny/articleshow/108147437.cms,02-03-2024,"The proposed
merger
between Reliance Industries-owned
Viacom18
and
Walt Disney
's
Star India
is likely to go through greater scrutiny by the Competition Commission of India (
CCI
) given the impact it could have on the media & entertainment sector, legal experts said.
The anti-monopoly watchdog might look at the combined market share of the proposed merged entity in the TV and streaming segments as the duo has a commanding presence in both segments, they added.
While referring to the CCI's order in the Sony-Zee combination plea, legal experts said the competition watchdog could also order Star and Viacom18 to divest channels in categories where they have market shares beyond the acceptable threshold level.
The CCI had given conditional approval to Sony-Zee in October 2022 by asking them to shut down three channels, Big Magic, Zee Classic, and Zee Action.
Live Events
The CCI usually conducts a detailed investigation if the combined market shares of the parties exceed 40-50% in any market.
In the TV broadcasting segment, the Star-Viacom18 combine has over 40% viewership share at the network level, as per market estimates. Star boasts a market share of over 30%, while Viacom18 has over 10%.
Star-Viacom18 has a near monopoly in the live sports segment with properties like the Indian Premier League (IPL), the International Cricket Council (ICC), and media rights to Indian, Australian, and South African cricket boards, besides Pro Kabaddi, the Indian Super League, and the English Premier League.
""While the two entities have agreed to consummate the merger, the Viacom-Disney deal will demand greater scrutiny by the CCI, especially given the market share that this combination would achieve,"" says TMT Law Practice Founding and Managing Partner Abhishek Malhotra.
""This is especially so since the cricket rights accorded to the combination and the resultant advertising rates that they will be able to command are quite pervasive.""
Within TV broadcasting, the combined entity's might in certain genres like Hindi and Marathi will be unmatched, with a market share of over 50%. The two also have significant viewership shares in the Bengali and Kannada markets.
In streaming, Disney+ Hotstar is India's largest platform, with 38 million subscribers, much ahead of Netflix and Prime Video. JioCinema has become one of the strongest streaming platforms on the back of free streaming of IPs like IPL and Bigg Boss.
""Given the strong presence of the parties in the broadcasting sector, the deal is likely to attract closer scrutiny from the CCI and may get into a detailed Phase II investigation,"" said Vaibhav Choukse, Partner and Head of Practice at JSA Advocates and Solicitors.
Choukse added that the CCI assessment would focus on the ability of Star-Viacom18 to increase ad rates and the level of bargaining power with downstream players like distribution platforms.
Shreevardhan Sinha, Senior Partner at the law firm Desai & Diwanji, said the proposed consolidation may necessitate divestment of assets, particularly TV channels, to alleviate apprehensions regarding their collective market dominance.
""When reviewing the now-failed Sony-Zee merger in 2022, the CCI identified the supply of TV channels as a relevant market, with general entertainment channels forming a sub-segment,"" he added.
Reliance, Viacom18, and Walt Disney had on February 28 signed definitive agreements to form a joint venture by merging Viacom18's media operations into Star India through a court-approved scheme of arrangement.
The Mukesh Ambani-led RIL has committed to investing Rs 11,500 crore ($1.4 billion) in the JV, which is valued at Rs 70,352 crore ($8.5 billion) post-money, excluding synergies.
RIL, Viacom18, and Disney will own 16.34%, 46.82%, and 36.84% of the JV, respectively.

Grip over cricket may lead to antitrust heat in Disney-Reliance India merger,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/grip-over-cricket-may-lead-to-antitrust-heat-in-disney-reliance-india-merger/articleshow/108139708.cms,01-03-2024,"NEW DELHI: A proposed merger of Walt Disney's and
Reliance
's media assets in India could spark intense
antitrust scrutiny
over their
market power
, with lawyers flagging concerns that the combined entity's strong
portfolio
of
cricket broadcast rights
could impact advertisers.
The Disney-Reliance $8.5 billion merger would create India's No. 1 TV player with 120 channels, with local rival Zee closest with 50.
Analysts at India's Ambit Capital estimate the entity, to be majority owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance, will have a 35% share of India's TV viewership.
While the overall TV space will be closely assessed by the
Competition Commission of India
(CCI), six antitrust lawyers said cricket rights are going to be in spotlight as the regulators examine
market share
and the power of the combined entity.
Cricket has a fanatical following in India, where many fans worship players as gods. Companies shell out billions of dollars to win broadcast rights or spend on advertisements to lure consumers to their services.

Disney holds TV broadcast rights for world's most-valuable cricket tournament,
Indian Premier League
(IPL), as well as both India TV and streaming rights for International Cricket Council's matches. Reliance has streaming rights for IPL, Indian cricket board's rights for all matches.
K.K Sharma, a former head of mergers at CCI, said the combined Disney-Reliance combo will raise eyebrows among regulators given the market power they will exert, especially in the cricket segment, requiring ""deeper scrutiny.""
""If I was the regulator, I would begin with suspicion,"" said Sharma, now a senior partner at Indian law firm Singhania & Co.
""With Disney and Reliance together, hardly anything of cricket will be left. The regulator gets concerned even when there is a possibility of dominance. Here, it is not merely dominance but almost an absolute control over cricket.""
Disney declined comment while Reliance did not respond to Reuters queries. The CCI also did not respond.
Media agency GroupM estimates sports industry spending in India totalled $1.7 billion in 2022, up 49% from the previous year. Cricket accounted for 85% of the spending on sponsorship, endorsement and media.
The companies will approach the CCI for approvals in coming weeks. Disney and Reliance have said they hope to complete the transaction by end of this year or early 2025.
A senior Disney source didn't comment on the scrutiny the merger may face, but said the company consulted a number of antitrust attorneys and is confident about the deal getting final clearance.
Five other lawyers echoed similar concerns as former CCI mergers' head Sharma, saying the Disney-Reliance entity's strong grip on the cricket ecosystem could mean advertisers have less bargaining power.
Vaibhav Choukse, head of competition law at India's J. Sagar Associates, said the companies can explore so-called ""behavioral commitments"" such as not adjusting
advertising
rates for a period of time to assuage concerns of regulators, who could in extreme cases order the entity to divest certain channels or cricket rights.
In a note, Jefferies said the Disney-Reliance entity ""will sport the most lucrative cricketing rights in India and has 40% share of the advertising market in TV and streaming segments, allowing it ""better ad inventory monetization.""
""The regulator's concern as far as cricket is concerned will be on the advantage the Disney-Reliance entity will have on raising prices for advertisers,"" said Karan Chandhiok, head of competition law at India's Chandhiok & Mahajan.
Disney and Reliance - before the merger - have competed intensely on cricket. Reliance recently offered free live streaming of Indian Premier League matches for which it had paid $2.9 billion in rights. Later, Disney offered free live streaming of cricket world cup on mobile devices.
The antitrust authorities will also closely look at the TV dominance.
But some lawyers have said the assessment on the TV side could become easier as another media merger between the India's
Zee Entertainment
and Japan's Sony collapsed this year, leaving more competitors in the market.
Still, lawyers said, Disney-Reliance could face heat on some key TV channel offerings where they together have an outsized market share that is above 40-50%.
A CCI Zee-Sony merger approval document from 2022 shows a Disney-Reliance combination back then would have had a 65-75% market share in Marathi language channels and around 50% in Bengali channels.

"If content is king, Reliance Industries-Walt Disney Company to be kingdom",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/if-content-is-king-reliance-industries-walt-disney-company-to-be-kingdom/articleshow/108117705.cms,01-03-2024,"Mumbai: The deal to merge
Reliance Industries
Ltd (
RIL
) subsidiary
Viacom18
and
The Walt Disney Company
’s local unit
Star India
will significantly alter the media and entertainment sector by creating the biggest media entity in the country, said industry executives and experts.
The Rs 70,352 crore ($8.5 billion) merged entity, in which RIL will infuse Rs 11,500 crore, will have a viewership share of more than 40%, enabling it to secure premium advertising rates and consumer average revenue per user (ARPU), they said.
The failure of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
and
Sony Pictures Networks India
to merge is expected to benefit Star-Viacom18, which would have had to contend with a duopoly if the Sony-Zee merger had also gone through.
'Big Daddy of Media'
The repercussions of the deal might also be felt in the telecom sector, where Reliance Jio’s rival
Bharti Airtel
would face pressure to step up its content offerings, said experts.
Live Events
According to industry estimates, telecom operators spend Rs 2,000-3,000 crore on procuring content.
Nuvama Institutional Equities executive director Abneesh Roy said the merger deal is negative for other broadcasters and telecom players, as Reliance Jio will gain superior access to content.
“The merger is potentially also slightly negative for advertisers as the bargaining power of the merged entity will be higher. In media, the leader takes it all. The JV (joint venture) will become the big daddy of media and will be 3-6x of other key peers,” he said.
Star-Viacom18 will have exclusive rights to all the key cricket properties, including the Indian Premier League, International Cricket Council and Board of Control for Cricket in India, in addition to about 200,000 hours of content comprising movies and TV shows.
The consolidation of TV and digital rights of key cricket properties under a single umbrella is expected to enhance monetisation over time.
Roy also said that Star-Viacom18 can gradually achieve profitability in sports by increasing subscriber ARPU and ad rates. The two companies have pledged roughly Rs 82,000 crore ($10 billion) in sports rights for the 2023-27 period.
The combined entity will house premium English content -- from Disney, NBC Universal, Paramount Global and HBO -- which will allow it to effectively compete against Netflix and Prime Video in the premium over-the-top (OTT) segment.
RIL and Viacom18 will own 63% stake in the JV while Disney will hold the remaining 37%. The fund infusion by RIL will help it invest in sports and digital content. Last year, Viacom18 received a fund injection of $1.8 billion from RIL and Bodhi Tree Systems.
The JV will have Nita Ambani as chairperson and Star’s former CEO Uday Shankar as vice chairperson.
The two companies together own 117 TV channels and two streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and
JioCinema
.
Star and Viacom18’s consolidated revenue in 2022-23 was about Rs 25,000 crore, higher than the combined revenue of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Sony Pictures Networks India and
Sun TV Network
, which was around Rs 18,000 crore.
Experts said the deal will also help RIL, which will control the JV, to overcome the growing threat of Google and Meta, which together gobbled up Rs 46,000 crore in digital ad spends in 2022-23.
Uday Sodhi, senior partner at Kurate Digital Consulting, said the merger will bring scale and disproportionate share of TV ad spends but will not have any meaningful impact on the ad revenue of tech giants as Google’s ad spends are primarily driven by search and Facebook through their social media platforms.
“The merged OTT platforms will probably bring some efficiency to advertising sales, but they’re unlikely to impact Facebook and Google. In the fast-growing digital advertising market, everyone will see the benefits of market expansion,” he said.
Vivek Couto, executive director, Media Partners Asia, said: “The JV is set to create a formidable entity, ultimately benefiting from scale and significant synergies in TV and streaming video while attempting to redefine the total industry revenue pie.”
NV Capital managing partner Nitin Menon said Star-Viacom18 has the potential to become a global entertainment industry bellwether. “This merger has the potential to create an impact at the global level too. We can’t ignore the fact that Reliance could have global ambitions in creating a TMT (technology, media and telecom) juggernaut -- that has a global presence and aspiration,” he said.

In the current quarter, the company expects to record non-cash pre-tax impairment charges estimated to be between $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion, approximately half of which reflect a write-down of the net assets of Star India in order to adjust them to fair value (less estimated transaction costs) pursuant to held-for-sale accounting and approximately half of which reflect a write-down of goodwill at the entertainment linear networks reporting unit, reflecting the impact of removing Star India,"" Walt Disney said in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Reliance-Disney deal: Nita Ambani to lead $8.5 billion mega-merger between Viacom18 and Star India
Reliance-Disney deal for the merger of Star India and Viacom18 is the biggest merger in the Indian media industry. This will make the merged entity India's largest media conglomerate.
ET Bureau
Under its held-for-sale accounting, Walt Disney will continue to adjust the net book value of Star India to its fair value (less estimated transaction costs) until the closing date of the transaction.

Disney to step back from India in mega-deal with Reliance Industries,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-to-step-back-from-india-in-mega-deal-with-reliance-industries/articleshow/108087431.cms,29-02-2024,"NEW DELHI: The
Walt Disney

Reliance Industries
, which is owned by

, India's richest person, will be Disney's senior partner in the deal. With $239 billion in market capitalization and rights to the wildly popular Indian Premier League cricket matches, Reliance is a juggernaut in the media landscape in India.
Disney and Reliance already had a combined market share of about 40% to 45% in advertising and about the same fraction of streaming, giving them a big edge over competitors, said Karan Taurani, a research analyst at Elara Capital.
""This will lead to better profitability because the content costs could come down"" in both TV and streaming, Taurani said.
As part of the deal, Disney will merge its Indian operations with those of Viacom18, a part of Reliance Industries. Reliance and Viacom18 will hold 63% of the new venture, and Disney 37%, the companies said in a statement. Reliance will pay $1.4 billion to consolidate its control.

Nita M. Ambani, Mukesh Ambani's wife, will be the chair of the joint venture; the vice chair will be Uday Shankar, the former chair of
Disney India
.
""Reliance has a deep understanding of the Indian market and consumer,"" Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, said in a statement. ""We're excited for the opportunities that this joint venture will provide to create long-term value.""
Disney is one of the biggest companies in the world, valued at $200 billion; in India, though, it proved no match for the homegrown hero. Disney first came to India, now a country of 1.4 billion potential media consumers, in 1993 and found a distributor to broadcast some of its content.
Along with India's market, Disney's ambitions grew. Last year, accounting and consulting firm EY estimated that India's media landscape would be worth $30 billion this year and $100 billion by 2030. And Disney banked on bringing hundreds of millions of subscribers to its own streaming services.
Disney's adventures in India were at their high point in 2019, when it bought 21st Century Fox from the Murdoch family's News Corp. Among Fox's assets, Disney won TV and streaming rights to the Indian Premier League cricket matches.
Big subscriber numbers followed but at great cost. At its pandemic-fueled peak, Disney+ had 162 million subscribers in India, but it was losing almost $500 million worldwide in pursuit of viewers. By summer 2022, its global operations had bled more than $11 billion since the purchase of Fox and launch of Disney+.
That is when Disney ran into trouble. Reliance Industries snatched away the cricket rights in 2022 for nearly $3 billion. Disney lost 11.5 million Indian subscribers in short order, even as it gained 800,000 new ones in the rest of the world.
Still, Disney is not abandoning India.
""India remains a key market for the company and one of the strongest international growth markets of scale, and we are committed to ensuring a robust presence there,"" Disney executives said in an email to employees Wednesday.
When Reliance was started by Mukesh Ambani's father in 1958, it was a trading shop, mainly of polyester fiber. It grew into petrochemicals and now runs the world's largest oil refinery at the port in Jamnagar, on a remote bit of India's western coastline. Along the way, it got into telecommunications and other businesses, and in 2016 started a low-cost mobile network, Jio, which quickly became the world's third-largest.
JioCinema, part of a growing family of Jio properties but a relatively small platform when India's streaming wars began, looks likely to become the new home for Disney's content in India. At one point another rival looked ready to emerge, as Japanese media giant Sony was seeking to expand its operations in India by buying
Zee Entertainment
.
With Zee, India's first private cable-TV company, Sony would have been big enough to divide up the TV-and-digital market with Reliance and Disney. But Sony backed out of its deal with Zee on Jan. 22, frustrated by the founding family's insistence on maintaining control.
Sony's breakup with Zee seems to have made things even harder for Disney. For one thing, Zee still owes Disney for cricket licensing. Bloomberg reported that the estimated value of Disney's India unit sank to $4.5 billion from $10 billion. Sony's failed merger also made the eventual Disney deal look sweeter for Ambani: What would have been a landscape defined by two giants is instead looking likely to be dominated by just one.
Being such a sprawling conglomerate, Reliance has an advantage in the battles for media domination. It does not need content to pay for itself directly. When their subscribers are brought into their retail, telecom and credit operations, the cost of making shows looks small by comparison to combined revenue.

Mukesh Ambani
, is betting big on the media & entertainment business, with
Reliance Industries
Limited's (
RIL
) committed investments in the segment already crossing Rs 22,000 crore in less than a year.
On Wednesday, RIL announced that it would infuse Rs 11,500 crore into the proposed joint venture (JV) with Walt Disney. In April 2023, it had invested Rs 10,839 crore as part of a Rs 15,145 crore fund injection in
Viacom18
with
Bodhi Tree Systems
investing Rs 4306 crore.
Sports and digital content have received major investments, and both will continue to be a core priority as the joint venture takes shape. The merger is expected to conclude in Q4 of 2024 or Q1 of 2025.
The Star-Viacom18 JV is expected to swiftly catapult Ambani's RIL to the top of the M&E hierarchy.
Star and Viacom18's consolidated revenue in FY23 was Rs 24,411 crore, surpassing Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Sony Pictures Networks India, and Sun TV Network's combined revenue of Rs 18,543 crore.
Live Events
Star India
's revenue in FY23 was Rs 19,857 crore, while Viacom18's was Rs 4,554 crore. Zee, Sony, and Sun TV's revenues were Rs 8,087, Rs 6,684, and Rs 3,772 crore, respectively.
The Star-Viacom18 JV will have a massive 117 TV channels across content genres like general entertainment, sports, kids, and movies. The proposed merged entity will also have two strong streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.
As per
Broadcast Audience Research Council
(BARC) data, the combined TV viewership share of the two companies is over 40%. Disney+ Hotstar is the biggest subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) player with 38 million subscribers. JioCinema, which is an advertising VOD platform had an average reach of 240 million in the April–June 2023 quarter, as per the data.ai.
Star-Viacom18 combine will have a virtual monopoly over cricket content, owning media rights to properties like the IPL and ICC as well as bilateral rights to India, Australia, and South Africa cricket boards. The duo has committed nearly $10 billion in sports rights investments between 2023 and 2027.
RIL, Viacom18, which is controlled by RIL, and Walt Disney Wednesday announced the signing of definitive agreements to form a JV by merging Viacom18's media operations into Star India through a court-approved scheme of arrangement.
The Star-Viacom18 venture is valued at Rs 70,352 crore post-money, with RIL controlling the JV.
RIL, Viacom18, and Disney will own 16.34%, 46.82%, and 36.84% of the venture, respectively. Currently, the RIL group, including TV18, holds 71.02% of Viacom18, followed by Bodhi Tree at 15.97% and Paramount at 13.01%.
TV18 is in the process of being amalgamated with Network18 Media and Investments. Post the amalgamation, Viacom18 will become a direct subsidiary of Network18, which also houses the TV, print, and digital news assets of the group, including News18 Network, moneycontrol.com, and Forbes India magazine, among others.

The sole board seat given to Bodhi Tree is likely to be taken up by its investor, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the person said.
INQ Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of QIA, had last year invested in Bodhi Tree Systems.
Both Reliance and Disney have set an ambitious deadline for completing the merger by October, another person stated.
However, legal experts cautioned that the completion of the merger will depend on the time it takes to receive Competition Commission of India (CCI) clearance. ""Most merger deals have a two- to three-year sunset clause. This will be no different,"" the person cited above said.
People earlier told ET that Reliance may own 61% of the proposed combined company, with Disney holding 33% and Bodhi Tree having the remaining 6%.
Shari Redstone-promoted Paramount Global, a shareholder in Viacom18, is set to exit the company with Reliance buying its stake. Reliance is expected to invest $1-2 billion, primarily for infusing growth capital into the merged entity and the buyout of Paramount's stake.

Reliance and Disney each have a streaming service as well as 120 television channels between them, and the deal will strengthen Reliance's hold over India's $28 billion media and entertainment market.
Reuters previously reported that Reliance is likely to have a 51%-54% stake in the merged entity, a deal that will value Disney's Indian operations at just $3.5 billion, sharply lower than the $15-$16 billion estimated in 2019.
Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar, is also set to take a stake of around 9% in the new merged entity. Disney will hold around 40%.
Disney's TV and streaming business in India has struggled over the years, with its digital platform facing an exodus of users amid stiff competition with Ambani's platform over cricket streaming.

Subhash Chandra moves SAT against Sebi order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/subhash-chandra-moves-sat-against-sebi-order/articleshow/108022251.cms,27-02-2024,"Subhash Chandra
, chairman emeritus of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
, has moved the
Securities Appellate Tribunal
(
SAT
), challenging the Securities & Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) confirmatory order issued last year that banned him from holding directorships in any listed entity.
SAT has asked Sebi to file its reply and has posted the matter for further hearing on March 8.
During the hearing on Monday, Sebi counsel Darius Khambata argued that Chandra is ‘not cooperating’ in an investigation into the alleged diversion of funds from the media company to the promoter-linked firms.
“Sebi has been writing to him, giving him summons, and seeking information and documents, "" argued Khambata. “We will put this on record that he (Chandra) has ‘not been cooperating,” he said.
Countering this, Chandra's counsel, Shyam Mehta, argued that SAT has already heard the matter and passed a judgement on an appeal filed by Zee Entertainment MD & CEO Punit Goenka that applies to Chandra as well.
Live Events
Mehta further argued that the
Sebi order
was prejudicial not only to his reputation but also to the companies with which he is associated.
The Sebi passed a confirmatory order on August 14, 2023, banning Chandra and his son Goenka from holding directorships or top-level positions in any listed company.
The same month, Goenka had moved the SAT and secured a stay order against the Sebi order. While granting relief to Goenka, the appeals tribunal allowed Sebi to continue the investigation against him. It had also asked Goenka to cooperate in the Sebi probe.
It is pertinent to note that Chandra had decided not to challenge the SAT verdict last year.
Sebi’s investigation against Zee promoters pertains to November 2019, when three independent directors of the media company resigned after raising concerns over several issues, including the alleged appropriation of a fixed deposit of Rs 200 crore of Zee by Yes Bank for squaring off the loans of related parties of Essel Group, the promoter entity.
The Sebi order was one of the key reasons for the failure of Zee’s proposed merger deal with Sony Group Corporation-owned Culver Max Entertainment. Sony didn't want Goenka to lead the proposed merged entity due to the taint of Sebi's investigation against him. The leadership issue became a bone of contention between the two companies.
On January 22, Culver Max terminated the merger deal with Zee over unfulfilled closing conditions to complete the merger. It has also asked Zee to pay $90 million in termination fees. Zee has contested Sony’s allegations.
The two companies are fighting it out legally before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre and the NCLT.

"Reliance, Disney may announce Star-Viacom18 merger this week",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-disney-may-announce-star-viacom18-merger-this-week/articleshow/107990898.cms,26-02-2024,"Mumbai:
Reliance
Industries and the Walt
Disney
Company have signed a binding agreement to merge
Viacom18
and
Star India
, with the deal expected to be announced early this week, people privy to the development told ET. The deal, which has been in the works for over four months, will create India's largest media empire, spanning TV broadcasting, streaming, movies and sports.
The two media companies generated
revenue
of ₹25,000 crore between them in FY23. ""The
merger deal
has finally been signed after months of negotiations. The announcement will happen early this week. It was expected to happen late last week,"" a top executive told ET on the condition of anonymity.
According to another person, Reliance may own 61% of the proposed combined company, with Disney holding 33% and Bodhi Tree Systems having the remaining 6%.
Despite being the larger of the two entities, Disney's Star India has seen its valuation drop to roughly $4 billion,
accounting
for the anticipated loss from its sports business. Viacom18 was valued at roughly $4 billion when Reliance and Bodhi Tree infused over ₹15,000 crore into the company in April last year. Paramount Global, a shareholder in Viacom18, is set to exit the company with Reliance buying its stake. In the US, the Shari Redstone-promoted company has become an acquisition target.

""Reliance is likely to invest $1-$2 billion, with a large part of that being deployed to infuse funds into the merged entity and a part going into the buyout of Paramount's stake,"" said a third person, asking not to be named.
Disney is expected to reduce its India exposure by diluting its stake in the merged entity, another person said. ""Disney doesn't see India as a key priority since it wants to strengthen its position in the US, where it is facing major challenges,"" the person added. Reliance and Disney declined to comment.
Uday Shankar, who is the promoter of Bodhi Tree along with James Murdoch, is expected to lead the merged entity. Currently, Bodhi Tree owns 15.97% of Viacom18, while Paramount holds 13%.
The proposed combined Star-Viacom18 entity will be a dominant force in the TV broadcasting industry, with more than 100 TV channels like Star Plus, Colors and Star Sports. The entity will also have two streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema, with dominant market shares in subscription and
advertising
video-on-demand segments.
According to legal experts, the Competition Commission of India will scrutinise the merger deal due to the proposed merged entity's market share of over 40% in both TV and streaming. Star-Viacom18 entity will own sports assets like the Pro Kabaddi League and Indian Super League, which is a 65:35 joint venture between Reliance and Disney.
The combined entity will have the TV and digital rights of all key sports properties including the Indian Premier League; International Cricket Council; cricket boards of India, Australia and South Africa; PKL, ISL, English Premier League; NBA and Olympics.
The combined investments of the two companies in the sports business are pegged at $10 billion with IPL alone accounting for $6 billion, followed by $3 billion in ICC rights.
The development comes at a time when the proposed merger between Sony Group-Culver Max Entertainment and
Zee Entertainment
collapsed last month due to disagreement over who would lead the combined company.

(
ZEEL
) over alleged corporate governance violations, has written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (
Sebi

fund diversion
that have been cited in media reports, said people aware of the matter.
The ministry's preliminary probe had found appropriation of ZEEL's fixed deposits (FDs) by
Yes Bank
, for squaring off loans of related entities of Essel Group. ZEEL is part of the
Essel Group
promoted by Subhash Chandra and his family.
Since 2019, both the MCA and Sebi have been investigating the group over allegations levelled by independent directors. While the MCA is probing allegations pertaining to violations under the Companies Act, 2013, Sebi is investigating accusations of capital market breaches. Their probes had found that FDs of Rs 200 crore were appropriated by Yes Bank for settling loans of related parties of Essel Group.
""However, now with reports that Sebi has found an accounting issue of over Rs 2,000 crore ($241 million), details of their findings have been sought,"" said a senior government official. ""The same would be studied to investigate if there was indeed a fund diversion, which is 10 times more than what was initially suspected.""

MCA lens on fund diversion by brass
The official said that during the course of the ongoing probe, ""if need be, even Puneet
Goenka
could be summoned to join the investigation"".
ZEEL CEO Goenka is Chandra's son. The person added that the MCA probe would investigate any corporate governance issues and fund diversions by key management personnel as well.
In November 2019, ZEEL independent directors Sunil Kumar and Neharika Vohra had resigned from the board, alleging governance lapses on matters such as treasury operations, related-party deals, film financing and corporate social responsibility expenses. They had raised concerns over ZEEL's FDs being appropriated by Yes Bank to settle a loan taken by ZEEL's related entities. However, these guarantees for the loans were given with the board's approval.
MCA, during the course of its probe into these allegations, had inspected ZEEL's offices, recorded statements of directors except Goenka and had also issued notices under Section 206 of the Companies Act seeking documents. It had also relied on Sebi's previous findings.
""The investigation revealed that Rs 200 crore in FDs available with Yes Bank was used to adjust loans of seven associate entities of ZEEL,"" said one of the persons cited above. ""This, after Chandra gave a Letter of Credit to Yes Bank for a Rs 200 crore outstanding loan of Essel Group Mobility.""
These ""associate entities"" included Pan India Infraprojects, Essel Green Mobility, Essel Corporate Resources, Essel Utilities Distribution Company, Essel Business Excellence Services, Pan India Network Infravest and Living Entertainment Enterprises.
ZEEL has denied the allegations in the past, saying that they were aimed at hampering deal talks with Sony. The Japanese giant pulled out of a deal to merge its India business with ZEEL in January, two years after it was announced.
In June 2023, Sebi had banned ZEEL chairman Chandra and CEO Goenka from holding any board positions in listed companies for a year, alleging active involvement in the diversion of funds to the group's other listed entities and related firms related to founding shareholders. This was said to be the issue that led to Sony's reluctance to proceed with the merger.
Sebi said that its order was to be read with the April 25, 2023, interim order passed in the matter of Shirpur Gold Refinery Ltd that said: ""The noticees (Chandra and Goenka) alienated the assets of ZEEL and other listed companies of Essel Group for the benefit of associate entities, which are owned and controlled by them. The siphoning of funds appears to be a well-planned scheme since, in some instances the layering of transactions involved using as many as 13 entities as pass through entities within a short period of two days only.""
While giving conditional approval to the proposed merger at the time, MCA had informed the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) that it had ordered the inspection of books of accounts to examine various complaints received against ZEEL.

Earlier this week, with the media reports alleging a $240 million or Rs 2,000 crore 'accounting hole', the media company termed it incorrect and false.

Zee-Sony's $10-billion merger had been officially called off on January 22. The mega merger, in the works for two years, would have created an Indian TV juggernaut with more than 90 channels across sports, entertainment and news that would have competed with the likes of Walt Disney, and billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance. In terminating the merger, Sony also cited alleged failure by the Indian media company to meet some financial terms of the deal, a dispute over compliance issues including disposal of some Russian assets.

BBC gets first Indian-origin chairman in Dr Samir Shah,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/bbc-gets-first-indian-origin-chairman-in-dr-samir-shah/articleshow/107920987.cms,22-02-2024,"India-born media executive
Dr Samir Shah
was on Thursday confirmed as the new
BBC chairman
after his selection cleared the stages of scrutiny to be approved by King Charles III this week. Shah, who has worked in
UK broadcasting
for over 40 years, was picked as the
government's preferred candidate
in December last year and went on to be quizzed by cross-party MPs of the House of Commons Media Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee for his pre-appointment scrutiny.
The 72-year-old has now been confirmed in the 160,000 pounds per year and four-year term role to take charge as the public broadcaster's first
Indian-origin
Chair from March 4 and running until March 2028.
""With a career spanning more than 40 years in TV production and journalism, Dr Shah has a wealth of experience to bring to the position of BBC Chair,"" said UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer as she announced his selection.
""He has a clear ambition to see the BBC succeed in a rapidly changing media landscape, and I have no doubt he will provide the support and scrutiny that the BBC needs to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future,"" she said.
Shah, who was honoured with a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2019 for services to television and heritage, will replace Richard Sharp who had been forced to resign after a communication with former prime minister Boris Johnson came under scrutiny.
Live Events
The government has said that Shah's knowledge of the British Broadcasting Corporation and his belief in its role as a national broadcaster alongside his extensive work to promote diversity in broadcasting will be invaluable in helping to ensure that the BBC reflects, represents and serves communities across the whole of the UK.
""The BBC is, without doubt, one of the greatest contributions we have made to global culture and one of our strongest calling cards on soft power. If I am able to put what skills, experience, and understanding of public service broadcasting I have built up during my career to help this brilliant organisation meet the complex and diverse challenges it faces over the coming years, it would be an honour,"" said Shah.
""The BBC has a great place in British life and a unique duty to reach a wide audience right across the country and I will do all I can to ensure it fulfils this in an increasingly competitive market,"" he said.
Born in Aurangabad, Shah came to England in 1960 and has previously been the head of current affairs and political programmes at the BBC.
Before taking up the role as Chair of the BBC, he was the CEO of Juniper - an independent television and radio production company, since 1998.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Television Society in 2002 and appointed Visiting Professor of Creative Media at Oxford University in 2019 and the University of Nottingham appointed him to a Special Professorship in the Department of Post-Conflict Studies.
Besides, the Oxford University alumnus is a race relations expert who co-authored the government's Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report in 2021.
As Chair, Shah will be responsible for the BBC's board upholding and protecting the independence of the broadcaster and making its decisions in the public interest.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises

Subhash Chandra
, chief executive and managing director
Punit Goenka
, the chief financial officer, as well as current and past board members - on the alleged
fund diversion
at the media firm, said two people close to the development.
The regulator has to complete its investigation by mid-April and initiate further legal proceedings based on its findings.
Sebi's initial findings in June last year said ₹200 crore from the company was diverted through related party transactions. This was contested by the father-son duo before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (
SAT
). However, Sebi later informed the tribunal that it was conducting a wider investigation as there were several layers to the transactions.
The regulator told the tribunal it found Chandra had issued a letter of comfort for ₹4,210 crore in his capacity as chairman of Essel Group.
""It was urged that eight months were required to complete a wider investigation, since now, the respondent (Sebi) finds that there are a large number of transactions - running into Rs 2,000 crore - involving companies owned, controlled or otherwise related to the promoters,"" said the October 30, 2023, SAT order.

Sebi is examining thousands of pages of transactions, bank statements, agreements, partnership deeds and board minutes, said one of the persons cited above. ZEE's current chairman is R Gopalan, former secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA).
ZEE shares tumbled 14.8% on the BSE on Wednesday to close at Rs 164.50 apiece, after Bloomberg reported Sebi had found that about $241 million (Rs 2,000 crore) might have been diverted by the company promoters. This has added to the steep decline in the
ZEE
share price after Sony Group scrapped a $10-billion merger plan involving its India business. A key factor for the collapse of the deal was the Sebi finding.
The regulator didn't respond to queries.
A spokesperson for Zee said, ""The reports and rumours pertaining to accounting issues in the company are incorrect and false. Pursuant to the SAT order, which granted relief to the current key managerial personnel (KMP), the company has been in the process of providing all comments, information or explanations requested by Sebi, and has extended complete cooperation on all aspects.""
Probe So Far
The genesis of Sebi's investigation is the resignation of three independent ZEE directors in November 2019, after they raised concerns over several issues, including the appropriation of a fixed deposit of Rs 200 crore of the company by
Yes Bank
for squaring off loans of related parties of Essel Group, promoted by Chandra and his family. Goenka is Chandra's son.
Its examination revealed that Chandra had issued a letter of comfort dated September 4, 2018, to Yes Bank regarding credit facilities availed by Essel Green Mobility.
Through this letter, it was stated that ZEE would ensure that a fixed deposit of at least Rs 200 crore would be made available to the bank at all times while the loan remained outstanding and, in the event of a default, the bank could appropriate the fixed deposit towards repayment.

and have extended complete co-operation on all aspects,"" news agency Reuters quoted the company as saying.
SEBI has reportedly found that around Rs 2,000 crore may have been diverted from the company, roughly ten times higher than its initial estimates, Bloomberg News reported citing sources on Wednesday. However, the amount found by SEBI is not final and may change after the regulator reviews the responses from the company executives, the report said.
ET Online hasn't verified this report independently.
Shares of
Zee Entertainment
bled, with the scrip trading at Rs 172 a piece, down over 10 per cent as of 10:15 am.
Live Events
ET on Tuesday reported that executives of Zee Entertainment and Sony Group were engaged in a 'last-ditch' attempt to revive their $10 billion merger which was officially called off on January 22. However, the company in a stock exchange clarification said “We would like to clarify that the Company has not involved in any negotiations, or any other event as stated in the above-mentioned article, and we categorically confirm that the abovementioned news item is factually incorrect.”
SEBI's eyes on Zee
The SEBI in June alleged that Zee Entertainment faked recovery of loans to cover private financing deals by its founder,
Subhash Chandra
. The regulator, through an interim order, alleged that Goenka and Chandra abused their position and siphoned off funds and barred the duo from holding executive or director positions in listed companies.
However, the Securities Appellate Tribunal stayed the order, and Goenka got a reprieve. Yet, Sony reportedly saw this development as a corporate governance issue.
In the a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Chandra alleged that SEBI was ""acting with a predetermined mind"", and sought steps ""to safeguard the interest of the minority shareholders of ZEEL"".
While terminating the merger plans, Sony Group said Zee Entertainment did not satisfy the merger conditions despite engaging in discussions to extend the end date for consummation of the transaction.
Following the termination of the merger agreement by Sony Group, Zee approached NCLT and Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), seeking its implementation which would create the nation's largest entertainment network company. Zee has also initiated legal actions to contest the claims of $90 million, or Rs 748.5 crore filed by Sony Group before the SIAC.
The collapsed deal, which had received almost all regulatory approvals, would have created an entertainment behemoth in which Sony was supposed to own a 50.86 per cent stake, with Goenka’s family owning 3.99 per cent.

Sebi uncovers $241 million accounting issue at Zee,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sebi-uncovers-241-million-accounting-issue-at-zee/articleshow/107862284.cms,21-02-2024,"India’s market regulator has found a hole of more than $240 million in the accounts of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
, dealing another blow to the embattled media firm less than a month after its
merger
with
Sony
Group Corp’s local unit collapsed.
As part of its investigation into the
Zee
founders, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, found that about 20 billion rupees ($241 million) may have been diverted from the company, said people familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified as the information is not public yet. That’s roughly ten times more than initially estimated by
Sebi
investigators, the people said.
The amount found missing is not final and may change after Sebi reviews the responses from the company executives, the people said. The regulator has been calling in senior officials at Zee including founders, Subhash Chandra, his son Punit Goenka and some board members to explain their stance, they added.
A Sebi representative didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comments. A Zee spokesperson declined to comment on the fund diversion but said in an email that the company “has been in the process of providing all the comments, information or explanation requested” by the markets regulator in the ongoing probe.
Sebi’s latest findings add to Goenka’s woes, as the Zee CEO tries to reassure investors after its $10 billion merger plan with Sony fell apart. The transaction, two years in the making, was terminated in January after a months-long stalemate on who’ll lead the new entity.

Zee, Sony huddle in dramatic twist to salvage merger
Much Wrangling
The regulatory probe into the father-and-son duo’s alleged financial improprieties has led to much wrangling between Sony and Zee since mid-2023. It made Sony wary of letting Goenka helm the merged entity while Goenka refused to give in as the CEO spot was promised to him in the 2021 merger pact. The standoff ultimately led to Sony scuttling the deal in January.
Sebi, in an order in August, barred Zee founders — Chandra and Goenka — from holding executive or director positions in any listed firm after finding that they had “abused their position” and siphoned off funds “for their own benefit.”
Zee appealed Sebi’s order in a higher appellate authority and got a partial reprieve in October which allowed Goenka to hold an executive position while the probe was underway.

The merger would have bolstered Sony by giving it access to Zee’s deep library of content in regional Indian languages while improving Zee’s financial health. Zee’s full-year profit plummeted by 95% in the twelve months to March 31. It reported a profit of 585.4 million rupees for the quarter ended Dec. 31 but missed analyst estimates.

It's no different, it appears, in the two-year-long saga that has sought to create the country's largest entertainment company by a merger.
Zee
Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) has re-engaged with
Sony
Group Corp in a last-ditch attempt to revive their $10-billion merger, which had been officially called off on January 22, people aware of the matter said.
Representatives from the two sides have held meetings across locations in Mumbai and efforts to salvage the deal have gathered momentum over the last fortnight. However, major differences are yet to be sorted out, and that could yet lead to the failure of the renewed talks, with both sides sticking firmly to their positions, as per executives aware of the matter.
Zee is expected to inform Sony over the next 24-48 hours if it’s willing to accept all terms and conditions, including conditions precedent (CPs), and go ahead.

India has great growth potential, will find another opportunity post Zee merger collapse: Sony
Key Points of Difference
Else, by the end of this week, Sony is expected to pull its original merger application filed with the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) over two years ago, when the two had agreed to merge.
A reconciliation on the other hand would mean legal proceedings that have been initiated will be withdrawn. Sony and Zee have both approached various forums, including the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SAIC) and the national company law tribunal (NCLT) over the matter.
Among the key points of difference now is a $300 million write off on cricket rights that needs to be settled before any agreement is signed. While Sony wants the write off/impairment to be booked upfront, Zee is seeking a postponement.

On the other hand,
Punit Goenka
, MD and CEO of ZEEL, is believed to have agreed to “relinquish” his previous demand of being made the CEO of the merged entity. Sony was completely opposed to him being the top boss of the merged company until he was cleared of charges related to money being diverted from Zee to closely held companies owned by his family’s Essel Group. Sony has maintained Goenka can at best be an adviser to the merged entity.
There is also disagreement over honouring some of the important CPs that are still “outstanding,” said the people cited above. Zee is pushing for any deal to be legally “irrevocable” once signed, but Sony is hesitant about making such a commitment. The original agreement between the two sides was signed in late 2021. Since then, significant value erosion has taken place and financials have worsened so Sony as an MNC does not want to get into any further binding agreements and is “hence uncomfortable with this”, said one of the executives cited.
Zee’s senior leadership on the other hand is confident that the company is on the mend after net profit in the quarter ended December jumped 141% to Rs 58.5 crore even as revenue dipped 3% to Rs 2,045 crore. Streaming arm ZEE5 is on an uptrend with the Q3 operating loss narrowing 13.4% to Rs 244 crore while revenue rose 15% to Rs 223 crore. On Monday, the Zee stock closed at Rs 178.65, down 3%.
A Zee spokesperson declined to comment, saying the matter is sub judice. Messages to Punit Goenka remained unanswered. Emails sent to Sony International did not get any response.

During an investor call on February 13, Goenka had said: “I certainly wanted the merger to be implemented. In line with this aspiration, we even took several steps towards divestment or closure of profitable businesses in the domestic and international markets. I personally offered several proposals and solutions to Sony, to address their demands, but unfortunately, they remained unaccepted.”
Legal Tussles
Following the termination of deal talks late last month, Mad Man Film Ventures, which Sony has called a proxy for Zee, moved the NCLT seeking implementation of the merger scheme between Sony and ZEEL. Sony’s India units Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment have filed applications before the NCLT challenging the maintainability of ZEEL’s application seeking implementation of the merger scheme.
In its January 24 plea at the NCLT, Zee asked the tribunal to prevent Sony Group-owned firms from adopting any further steps that could jeopardise the implementation of the scheme.
The Mumbai bench of the NCLT has clubbed ZEEL's plea with that of shareholder Mad Man Film Ventures and has posted the matter for hearing on March 12, ET reported February 6. Mad Man Film Ventures has also urged the tribunal to appoint a committee comprising two directors each from Zee and Sony to oversee the implementation of the composite scheme of arrangement.
On February 4, the SIAC denied emergency interim relief to the Sony Group-owned entities against Zee, stating it has no jurisdiction to prevent the latter from approaching the NCLT and that the tribunal is the appropriate forum to handle the dispute.
The Goenka family owns 3.99% equity in ZEEL. The rest is held by public and institutional shareholders.
After the two media giants terminated talks on January 22, Zee’s stock rose as much as 14%. However, over the past month, it’s dropped 24%. Indian mutual funds and insurance companies including LIC hold 31% of the company. FIIs owned 28.19% as per December 2023 data.
Zee had told analysts after its third-quarter earnings call that it plans to review the entire business portfolio following the collapse of the merger.
“We will be relooking at the entire portfolio of the business to see which businesses will add the maximum value to our portfolio and, therefore, what we need to focus on, and what we do not need to focus on going forward,"" Goenka had told analysts.

Strong outlook: Indian print media industry is poised to record robust growth in 2024,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/strong-outlook-indian-print-media-industry-is-poised-to-record-robust-growth-in-2024/articleshow/107801911.cms,20-02-2024,"Mumbai: The Indian
print media industry
is poised to record
robust growth
in 2024, with
advertising revenues
projected to return to pre-pandemic levels and
profit margins
improving amid softening of
newsprint prices
. According to the Pitch Madison Advertising Report 2024, print ad revenue is anticipated to rise by 7%, reaching ₹20,613 crore this year, surpassing pre-Covid figures in 2019.
The report predicted a 12% increase in total ad expenditure to ₹1.11 lakh crore. It also noted a consistent increase in print ad revenue, from ₹16,595 crore in 2021 to ₹18,470 crore in 2022 and ₹19,250 crore in 2023. Newsprint prices, a significant factor in direct variable costs for print media companies, have decreased from over ₹80,000 per metric tonne post-Covid to about ₹50,000 per metric tonne.
'Print remains resilient'
Madison World Chairman
Sam Balsara said print remains resilient in India despite being in terminal decline globally. He also expects print to record rapid growth in 2024. ""The global share of print is 4%; India's share is 20% (to the total advertising spend). That's phenomenal. In China, the
print share
is near zero. In the US and UK, it is less than 5%,"" the ad veteran told ET.
Live Events
""While the share of print is declining, in rupee terms, it has been growing year-on-year. And we expect good growth in 2024 too, higher than the growth achieved last year,"" he added.
Sivakumar Sundaram, CEO, The Times of India, said print ad revenue in 2024 is anticipated to reach an all-time high. He also noted that newspapers, with their high credibility, affordability, and daily home delivery, coupled with strong readership habits, serve as a shield against Big Tech challenges.
BCCL is the publisher of The Times of India and The Economic Times.
""Print continues to be a strong evergreen medium for advertisers who are looking to build trust and credibility for their brands. We continue to bring innovation to print ads, increasing the impact for our advertisers,"" Sundaram said.
In July 2023, Crisil predicted a 13-15% revenue growth for Indian print media, to ₹30,000 crore, this financial year, driven by higher corporate and government ad spending.
'Strong outlook'
Girish Agarwal, shareholder of
DB Corp
, noted that the credibility of newspapers, coupled with burgeoning economic activity and growth in tier-II and beyond markets, has translated into improved ad revenues for Indian-language newspapers.
""We believe that the outlook for the sector remains very strong with the current growth momentum, which is set to increase going forward,"" he added. MV Shreyams Kumar, managing director of Mathrubhumi Group said growth estimates projected by media agencies for print are very conservative. ""Print is an important medium for brand building. Election year is usually a good year for print,"" he noted. Shashi Sinha, CEO, IPG Mediabrands India, predicts strong growth for print in 2024 due to the Lok Sabha elections and new automobile launches, benefiting both English and regional print.
""Credibility plays an important role, especially in an election year. In my personal view, digital is a bit oversold. Auto launches will also help the print medium post strong growth,"" he added.
'Helps Brand Recognition'
""For brand recognition and building trust, print ad is very effective. It also allows customisation for national/local/hyperlocal targeting hyper-geographies. Combining digital and print can bring maximum effectiveness to a marketing campaign,"" said Devndra Chawla, CEO, GreenCell Mobility, a mass mobility business. In September 2023,
ICRA
forecasted a 500-600 basis point increase in operating margins in FY24 due to lower newsprint costs and poll-driven ad revenue.
According to Sundaram, The Times of India has balanced its portfolio between domestic and international newsprint suppliers to mitigate geopolitical challenges and supply chain disruptions. ""This overall downward trend in newsprint prices has indeed had a strong positive impact on the bottom line of print media companies."" Agarwal said DB Corp's average cost for newsprint fell by 18-20% year-on-year in the last quarter from the high level of ₹64,000 per metric tonne to around ₹48,000 currently, further boosting the company's Ebitda margins.
""With a further estimated correction of 2-3% in newsprint prices and high base of last year, we expect the benefit to continue in 2024,"" he said.

The TRAI and MIB regulate TV channel pricing and content, respectively. The IBDF comprises 56 broadcaster members, representing nearly 450 channels. AIDCF represents the cable TV companies.
""The exclusion of broadcasters from the deliberations represents a missed opportunity for informed decision-making and risks the adoption of regulatory measures that may have unintended consequences for broadcasting industry stakeholders, especially consumers,"" Jain said.
The AIDCF has been demanding that TRAI allow its members to pick and choose channels from broadcaster bouquets, something that the TRAI regulation has outlawed.
In its report, the IT committee has favoured allowing cable TV service providers to selectively choose channels from broadcaster bouquets.
The cable TV body claimed that granting distributors the freedom to choose channels from broadcaster bouquets would benefit consumers in the form of a price reduction.
However, the IBDF has countered this argument by contending that the breaking of broadcaster bouquets will allow cable TV companies to misuse this freedom and distort the present regulatory framework.
The AIDCF has blamed price hikes by broadcasters and TRAI regulations for the continuous decline in the cable TV subscriber base.
""As the apex body of broadcasters, our members are directly affected by the subject matter under consideration. We believe our perspectives and insights must be duly considered in the formulation of any regulatory recommendations or decisions,"" Jain said.

The potential deal signifies Mukesh Ambani-owned Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate's strategic move to strengthen its presence in India's television distribution sector and expand the reach of its OTT platform,

Disney, Reliance merger discussions reach last lap as Feb 17 exclusivity deadline draws near
However, no agreement was reached.
If the negotiations between Reliance and Tata Play prove successful, it would mark the first collaboration between the Tata group and the Ambanis. Additionally, it would expand the reach of JioCinema, Reliance's streaming platform, to Tata Play customers. Disney had initially planned to
divest its shares during Tata Play's IPO
, but with the postponement of the listing, it began exploring other exit strategies.
Sources familiar with the matter said that Reliance aims to offer its entire JioCinema content catalog to Tata Play customers upon acquiring the stake.
""I think if this is true, it does make sense for Reliance because they are already present on the MSO (multiple-system operator) side through Hathway and DEN, but DTH side they don't have presence,"" Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara Capital, told ET Online.

""In the current market environment, MSO side is losing market share to DTH, which has got a more premium customer base compared to MSO in terms of ARPUs. So, DTH has a protected base with the premium customer base and that will augur well for JioCinema to tie up and reach out to a larger subscriber base,"" he said, adding it will also limit the competitive intensity for Reliance that has bundled offerings.
Bankers are currently assessing the value of Disney's stake in Tata Play, Business Standard reported citing sources. Despite its significant presence in the market, satellite television broadcaster Tata Play faces challenges from competing streaming platforms like Netflix, Hotstar, JioCinema, and Amazon Prime. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, Tata Play reported a loss of Rs 105 crore on revenue of Rs 4,499 crore, contrasting with the previous year's profit of Rs 68.60 crore on revenue of Rs 4,741 crore.

Parl Panel to hold 'constructive' talks with ministry on Broadcast Bill,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/parl-panel-to-hold-constructive-talks-with-ministry-on-broadcast-bill/articleshow/107566819.cms,10-02-2024,"The
parliamentary standing committee
on communications and information technology said it will engage in constructive discussions with the
information and broadcasting ministry
on the proposed Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill, 2023, which has created a furore in the
TV broadcasting
and over-the-top (OTT) segments.
In its 56th report titled '
Regulation of Cable Television
in India', the committee, headed by
Shiv Sena MP Prataprao Jadhav
, also asked the ministry to apprise it about the timeline when the ministry would introduce the draft Bill in Parliament. ""The committee would further like to engage in constructive discussions regarding the proposed draft legislation at a more mature stage of its formulation,"" the report said.
The Bill, which seeks to replace the
Cable Television Networks Regulation Act
, 1995, aims to bring TV, OTT, radio, cable, DTH, IPTV and HITS under a
common regulatory framework
. It was released for public consultation on November 10, 2023, and the last date for furnishing comments was January 15 this year.
While taking note of the challenges faced by cable TV service providers in the country, the committee said the industry needs to be regulated through a comprehensive law and asked the ministry to ensure that the proposed Bill is introduced at the earliest. It said the draft Bill would go a long way in addressing the issues faced by the cable TV industry. Cable TV is regulated by multiple laws and regulators, including the ministry, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and the department of telecom.
It also asked the ministry to ""ensure that adequate consultations are done with all the concerned stakeholders"". The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation and News Broadcasters and Digital Association have raised concerns that the Bill attempts to give unbridled powers to the government to interfere with content creation and dissemination process. On the issue of broadcast tariff, the committee said TV distributors should be given the freedom to pick and choose channels from the broadcaster bouquets since they are the link between the consumers and broadcasters.
Live Events
""To safeguard consumer interests and promote freedom of choice, the committee recommends that distribution platform operators be granted the authority to select individual channels from broadcasters' bouquets,"" the committee said.

BCCI seeks Supreme Court view on media rights sale as 'franchise services',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/bcci-seeks-supreme-court-view-on-media-rights-sale-as-franchise-services/articleshow/107533831.cms,08-02-2024,"The Board of Control for
Cricket
in India (
BCCI
) has sought the
Supreme Court
view on whether its sale or grant of
media rights
qualified as taxable ""franchise services,"" therefore subject to service tax.
The issue arose after the Bombay High Court last year asked the cricket body to approach the Supreme Court to determine whether service tax can be levied for services rendered by the cricket board following agreements signed with MSM Satellite (Singapore) Pte Ltd and World Sport Group (India) in 2008 and 2009 in respect of telecast of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches being played in India.
A Bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud sought response from the Finance Ministry and the Commissioner of Service Tax, Mumbai, on the BCCI's appeals against a demand for payment of service tax to the tune of around ₹250 crore, including penalty.
Challenging a part of the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal's 2018 order that ruled against it, BCCI said its grant of media rights does not amount to providing of ""franchise services"" as the key ingredients to qualify as these services are not satisfied in its case.
BCCI is not granting the broadcasters any representational rights nor the latter are performing any output services or undertaking any activity which can be identified with the cricket body, senior counsel Arvind Datar told the apex court.

,
Walt Disney
's
ESPN
and
Warner Bros Discovery
said on Tuesday they will launch a
sports streaming service
later this autumn to capture younger viewers who are not tuned in to television.
The media companies will form a joint venture to create a new service from their broad portfolio of professional and collegiate sports rights, which span the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, FIFA World Cup and college competitions.
The yet-to-be-named service would offer an all-in-one package of programming that would include television channels, such as ESPN, TNT and FS1, as well as sports content that is streamed. Subscribers would also have the option of subscribing to it as part of a streaming bundle from Disney+, Hulu or Max.
""This means the full suite of ESPN channels will be available to consumers alongside the sports programming of other leaders,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement.
Media analyst Michael J. Wolf of Activate Consulting said the venture will appeal to the 40 million households in the U.S. that pay for high-speed internet access, but don't subscribe to pay TV. An all-sports digital offering also is likely to appeal to Amazon, Apple and Roku, which aggregate streaming video for millions of consumers.

""It's a smart defensive move with potentially huge upside,"" former Disney executive Bernard Gershon said. The launch will come at a time when cable television continues to lose subscribers. Live sports continue to serve a powerful audience draw, whether on television or online, as NBCUniversal's Peacock demonstrated last month with its live streaming of the NFL's AFC wild card playoff game, he said. Still, that audience comes at a hefty price, reportedly $110 billion for media rights for the NFL.
""Let's figure out a way to split the costs of rights as they go up,"" said Gershon, explaining the possible deal logic. ""And let's create a platform that people will go for a range of sports and capture some of the upside.""
The CEOs have been discussing a collaboration for some time, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The partners view this sports-centric service as providing consumers with more choice, not replacing Disney's flagship ESPN television network or Fox's FS1, which already reach an avid group of sports fans on TV, according to sources familiar with the matter.
""We believe the service will provide passionate fans outside of the traditional bundle an array of amazing sports content all in one place,"" said Fox Chief Executive Lachlan Murdoch.
The new entity will be jointly owned by the three media companies, which will have equal board representation and agree to license their sports content on a non-exclusive basis. An independent management team will operate the new entity.
The sports-centric service signals a recognition that there is a large market for sports outside of traditional TV. This platform is designed to capitalize on that opportunity. It also provides another way for these media companies to monetize increasingly costly sports rights.
""This new sports service exemplifies our ability as an industry to drive innovation and provide consumers with more choice, enjoyment and value,"" Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in a statement.
Early last year, Iger had suggested that Walt Disney wants to keep ESPN and will look for strategic partners and investors, as he sought to take the network online.
Activist investor Nelson Peltz believes Disney can achieve profitability in streaming by bundling its ESPN+ online service with a larger player interested in sports, according to media reports from last month.

Despite Sony's decision to scrap the merger on January 22, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) has permitted Zee Entertainment to approach the Indian tribunal to enforce the $10 billion merger with Sony's Indian unit. Sony cited breaches of contract as the reason for terminating the merger, leading Zee to challenge these claims and seek an order from the Indian tribunal compelling Sony to fulfill its obligations for the merger's completion.
Zee rejected the claims and asked an Indian tribunal to order Sony to honour its obligations to complete the merger.
The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) said it had no jurisdiction or authority to block Zee from approaching the Indian tribunal, adding the merger fell within the purview of the
National Company Law Tribunal of India
, Zee said in filings to Indian stock exchanges.
The
Zee-Sony merger
, in the works for two years, would have created an Indian TV juggernaut with more than 90 channels across sports, entertainment and news that would have competed with the likes of Walt Disney, and billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
's Reliance. In terminating the merger, Sony also cited alleged failure by the Indian media company to meet some financial terms of the deal, a dispute over compliance issues including disposal of some Russian assets and its $1.4 billion Disney cricket rights deal, Reuters reported last week.

that was called off by the Japanese company's Indian arm. An Emergency Arbitrator of Singapore International Arbitration Centre denied the interim relief sought by
Culver Max
and
BEPL
(Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd) to restrain Zee Entertainment Enterprise Ltd (ZEEL), observing it lacks jurisdiction to pass such an order, ZEEL stated in a filing to stock exchanges.
""We wish to inform that the Emergency Arbitrator has passed an award dated February 4, 2024 denying the application for emergency interim relief filed by Culver Max and BEPL and has determined that the Emergency Arbitrator has no jurisdiction or authority to injunct the Company from approaching the NCLT to implement the Merger Scheme since these are matters which fall within the statutory system and are for the NCLT to decide,"" it added.
Sony had last month terminated the merger agreement with ZEEL to merge its two Indian entities - Culver Max Entertainment (earlier known as Sony Pictures Network India) and BEPL.
Sony Group Corporation (SGC) had said ZEEL did not satisfy the merger conditions and initiated arbitration proceedings before SIAC claiming USD 90 million (around Rs 748.5 cr) as a termination fee.
While, ZEEL filed a petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), seeking a direction to Sony group to implement the merger scheme.
Live Events
ZEEL had also initiated appropriate legal actions to contest the claims of USD 90 million filed by Sony Group before SIAC.
It asserted that Sony Group firm Culver Max and BEPL (Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd), which were to be merged with ZEEL, ""are in default of their obligations to give effect to"" and implement the scheme of merger that was sanctioned by the NCLT.
""The company approached the NCLT, Mumbai-bench, inter alia seeking directions to implement the merger scheme,"" ZEEL had said in a regulatory filed on January 24, two days after Sony terminated the merger agreement.
The Mumbai bench of NCLT on August 10, 2023, approved the scheme of merger of ZEEL with Sony group entities Culver Max Entertainment and BEPL, which could have created a USD 10 billion media entity.
If the Sony-Zee merger was completed, the combined entity would have owned over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services -- ZEE5 and Sony LIV -- and two film studios --
Zee Studios
and
Sony Pictures Films
India-- making it the largest entertainment network in the country.

Broadcasters want OTT to be kept outside broadcast bill's purview,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/broadcasters-want-ott-to-be-kept-outside-broadcast-bills-purview/articleshow/107404330.cms,04-02-2024,"The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF) has urged the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) to exclude
OTT platforms
from the
Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill
2023, as they are distinct from linear broadcasting platforms.
The IBDF, which represents top broadcasters like Disney Star, Zee, Sony, and Viacom18, proposed that the programme code and advertisement code should be included in the draft bill for consultation, while the MIB suggested that they be prescribed later.
The IBDF argued that clubbing linear TV with OTT would constitute 'reverse discrimination' and violate Article 14 of the constitution, as unequals cannot be treated equally.
The draft
broadcast bill
, released by the MIB on November 10 last year, aims to replace the three-decade-old
Cable Television Networks Regulation Act
of 1995.
It proposes broadening the scope of broadcasting to include both
broadcast content
and broadcast distribution systems, including OTT.

The bill was put up for public consultation, with the last date for comments being January 15, which was informally extended to January 26.
The IBDF further stated that the prescription to set up a Content Evaluation Committee (CEC) would result in censoring content on broadcasting platforms, thereby curtailing the freedom of speech and expression of the broadcasters.
The draft bill proposes the formation of content evaluation committees (CECs) as part of its three-tier regulatory structure for regulating content. Only shows approved by the CEC can be aired on TV channels and OTT platforms.
The committee would be made up of notable personalities from various socioeconomic groups, including women, child welfare, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and minorities. The central government may specify the number of panel members, the requisite quorum, and other details to facilitate the CEC's establishment and operation.
The foundation further stated that the provision for the formation of the Broadcast Advisory Council (BAC) not only undermines the goal of self-regulation but also raises concerns about the independent functioning of its members.
The BAC would be the third level of the three-tier regulatory structure, with one chairperson, five government-nominated ex-officio members from five ministries, and five independent members appointed by the government.
The IBDF also stated that the existence of multiple rating agencies may result in conflict of data and therefore the present system of having a single industry-led body should be allowed to continue. Currently, the industry-backed Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) is the sole TV viewership measurement body in the country.
It also told the MIB that the imposition of excessive penalties would discourage content creators from freely expressing their ideas, thereby stifling free speech.
According to the IBDF, the lack of sufficient guidelines in the draft bill concerning rule-making power suffers from the vice of excessive delegation. It noted that the central government has been granted rule-making power in 65 instances in the bill.

"Zee-Sony deal breakers: Unmet deadlines, bitter emails and dissent over who's boss",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-zee-sparred-for-months-before-split/articleshow/107393960.cms,04-02-2024,"Mumbai: Months of drama and bitter email exchanges preceded the
Sony Group
’s decision to call off its
merger deal
with
Zee
Entertainment Enterprises, with both sides accusing each other of not meeting the conditions required to complete the transaction, show documents accessed by ET.
While the deal collapsed primarily due to a disagreement over who would be the managing director and chief executive of the joint entity, other factors also played a role, suggest the communication between the companies. In its deal termination notice, Sony-owned
Culver Max Entertainment
claimed multiple breaches by Zee, some of which “uncurable”, of the December 22, 2021 merger cooperation agreement (MCA).
Sony rejected Zee's proposal for a six-month extension to the deal closure deadline after the end of one month of good faith negotiations on January 21. For this, it cited Zee’s inability to provide a clear timeline to complete outstanding issues that were a must to conclude the merger, as per the email exchanges seen by ET.
The MCA breaches, according to Sony, included a decline in Zee’s operating profit below the agreed Rs 1,555 crore, non-disclosure of certain pending investigations, signing of a deal with Disney Star for International Cricket Council TV rights without Sony’s consent, and venturing into a new business by launching a TV channel in South Africa.
Sony claimed that Zee's Rs 3,370 crore commitment in bank guarantees and deposits to Disney Star for the ICC TV rights, along with its existing debt of Rs 3,007.5 crore, had resulted in its binding debt exceeding Rs 3,750 crore, which was a violation of the MCA, as per the documents.
Live Events
In response, Zee termed Sony's conduct in raising the ICC issue “belatedly” as reprehensible and unfortunate, stating that the MCA had sports-related exceptions. It deemed Sony's request for provisioning losses on ICC TV rights as against industry accounting norms.
The Punit Goenka-led company said
Sony
was aware that Zee would not be able to meet the Rs 1,555 crore Ebitda criteria and questioned its motives for raising the issue at a late stage of the deal. It defended the
Zee Zonke
launch in South Africa, terming it a normal product launched in the ordinary course of the business.
Zee said it had incurred/provided for in its books of account about Rs 700 crore towards divestment of businesses as well as settlement of frivolous claims and guarantees.
In its deal termination notice, Sony alleged that Zee misrepresented facts over GST notices in March and June last year. The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) had accused Zee of fraudulently availing of input tax credit by using bogus invoices.
Sony said despite having a strong case, Zee voluntarily complied with the tax demand and deposited Rs 174.5 crore to secure closure of the proceedings.
Denying Sony's charge of misrepresentation, Zee said information about the notices and the draft responses to the DGGI was disclosed to Sony through emails in August and September.
Sony pointed out that Zee retracted its original deduction claim of Rs 1,261.95 crore from its income tax filings and amortised it in its financial statements, hurting its financial position and leading to additional tax liabilities.
In email exchanges, it also accused Zee of failing to divest a Russian subsidiary and liquidating a German unit as agreed in the deal agreement, while Zee argued that the divestment/liquidation would extend beyond the agreed closure date due to alternative structures it was pursuing.
In an email on September 21, Sony Pictures Entertainment executive vice president for M&A Erik Moreno suggested that NP Singh be named the MD and CEO of the merged entity due to the Securities Exchange Board of India's verdict against Goenka, sparking a feud between the two companies. Singh is the chief of Sony’s India media unit.
Moreno had also urged Zee chairman R Gopalan to complete the merger by November 1, 2023, as a delay would not benefit both companies. The earlier deadline of September 30, 2023 could not be met due to the Sebi order barring Goenka from holding any top post in any listed company.
""In light of the status of Mr Goenka's hearings, our only practical option is to retain NP Singh as the MD & CEO of the company on closing since further MIB (Ministry of Information and Broadcasting) approval would not be required for him to continue in that capacity. We are confident that the Zee board appreciates this reality,"" Moreno told Gopalan.
As per the MCA, Goenka was poised to become MD and CEO of the proposed Zee-Sony entity, but his appointment was jeopardised by Sebi's orders in June and August 2023. The order was later set aside by the Securities Appellate Tribunal; however, Goenka continues to be under Sebi investigation.
Zee, meanwhile, accused Sony of failing to meet two joint closing conditions, including seeking the ministry’s approval for the transfer of licences from Zee to the merged entity and the appointment of Goenka as MD and CEO, besides the constitution of the merged entity’s board. Sony claimed that the application for Goenka’s appointment couldn not be filed due to Sebi’s order against him.

Viacom18 and Star India merger talks in advanced stage,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/viacom18-and-star-india-merger-talks-in-advanced-stage/articleshow/107390837.cms,04-02-2024,"Mumbai:
Mukesh Ambani
's
Reliance Industries
and
Walt Disney Company
are in advanced discussions for signing an agreement to merge
Star India
and
Viacom18
to create India’s largest media empire, spanning over 100 TV channels and two streaming platforms, according to people privy to the development.
Reliance could hold more than 51% of the shareholding in the proposed Star-Viacom18 merged entity, with Disney owning a 40% stake, one of the people said. Uday Shankar and James Murdoch-promoted Bodhi Tree Systems' stake in the merged entity could be 7-9%.
Another person said Reliance is anticipated to inject additional capital in the merged entity, establishing it as a direct subsidiary.
Star and Viacom18 generated combined revenue of Rs 25,000 crore in the fiscal ended March 31, 2023. Apart from TV and digital assets, the combined entity will also own sports assets like the Indian Super League and the Pro Kabaddi League.
Reliance has valued Star India at around $4 billion, adjusting for losses from cricket rights and the drop in Disney+ Hotstar subscriber base, resulting in a combined entity valuation of $8 billion, said a top executive in the know.

Viacom18 was last valued at $4 billion, after a Rs 15,000 crore fund infusion by Reliance and Bodhi Tree Systems in April 2023, this person said.
The proposed merger deal could trigger the exit of Shari Redstone's Paramount Global, which had last year seen its shareholding in Viacom18 drop from 49% to 13% as the company was not keen to provide fresh capital for sports expansion.
Together they have committed to make more than $10 billion in sports investment — $4 billion by Viacom18 and $6 billion by Disney Star — over four to five years.
Reliance is considering Uday Shankar to helm the proposed Star-Viacom18 merged entity, said people privy to the matter. He currently oversees Viacom18's affairs as a director and shareholder.
Disney Star, Paramount and Reliance declined to comment.
On January 24, ET reported that Reliance was likely to downgrade Star India's valuation by up to $2 billion following Zee Entertainment Enterprises' decision to back out of the International Cricket Council (ICC) TV rights deal.
Star had acquired the ICC media rights for $3 billion and sub-licenced the TV rights to Zee for close to $1.5 billion while retaining the digital rights.
Zee backed out earlier this month after its merger deal with Sony Group's India media arm collapsed.
Star India's sports business posted an operating loss of $432 million in the financial year through September 2023.
Disney+ Hotstar saw a fall of about 24 million subscribers between October 2022 and September 2023, after it lost the IPL digital rights to Viacom18.
Once the Star-Viacom18 merger is concluded, it will spawn a media goliath with a market share of over 40% in TV, which could attract the Competition Commission of India's attention.
The competition watchdog had given conditional approval to the now-aborted Sony-Zee merger after asking Zee to sell three channels to allay concerns of appreciable adverse effects on competition.

Nirmala Sitharaman
on Thursday allocated Rs 4,342.55 crore to the
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
in the

According to the Budget document presented by Sitharaman, a large portion of the allocation -- Rs 2,959.94 crore -- has been made to broadcasting, while Rs 1,088.16 crore has been earmarked under the head of Information and Publicity, which is marginally higher than the revised estimates of the previous fiscal.
Sitharaman has allocated Rs 36.93 crore under the head of Art and Culture, which is less than the Rs 45.54 crore earmarked in the revised estimates for 2023-24.

continues to be in talks with
Disney India
to merge the American entertainment giant's local businesses with
Viacom18
, with the
Ambani-led company
likely pick up atleast a 50% stake in the merged entity.
The latest agreement between
Disney
India, Viacom18 and
Bodhi Tree
will likely see Disney retain 40% of the merged business, with the other 60% split between the other two entities, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Bodhi Tree is reportedly eyeing up a 7-9% stake.
For Bodhi Tree - a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former
Star India
executive, Uday Shankar, formed in 2021 - the merger is a return to familiar ground, with the Murdoch-Shankar duo having worked together to build Star, before its eventual purchase by Disney in 2019. Shankar was CEO of Star India for a decade until 2020.
Disney has been in talks to merge its business with the Ambani media house since December, with the WSJ reporting that Viacom18 will pay about $1.5 billion in cash in addition to stock in return for its stake in the merged company. The deal is expected to close in February, with terms not yet finalised.
Ealier this week, Bloomberg reported that Disney’s India assets are valued at around $4.5 billion, less than the $10 billion the US entertainment giant has previously pursued.

The dip in valuation is partly attributed to a write-off of revenue from the sale of cricket TV rights by Disney to embattled Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., which is now expected to be unable to pay up.
Disney's struggles with streaming in India were exarcebated after Viacom18 outbid the American company to the rights for the Indian Premier League, shelling out $2.6 billion to stream the tournament till 2027.
In August 2023, Disney's quarterly earnings showed a 12 million drop in streaming subscribers in the subcontinent, largely attributed to the loss of IPL streaming, which had been a mainstay on Hotstar.
Hotstar’s subscriber count stood at 37.6 million in the most recent quarter, down from a peak of 61.3 million in October 2022.

Restrain ZEE from seeking relief from NCLT or other courts: Sony to SIAC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/restrain-zee-from-seeking-relief-from-nclt-or-other-courts-sony-to-siac/articleshow/107302357.cms,02-02-2024,"Mumbai: Sony Group-owned entities
Culver Max Entertainment
and
Bangla Entertainment
have urged the Singapore International Centre (
SIAC
) to restrain
Zee
Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) from seeking legal remedies from the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) or any other court or tribunal in India and elsewhere.
Sony has alleged in its application before SIAC that Mad Man Film, which filed the application before NCLT on December 5, is a proxy for ZEE.
""An order injuncting the respondent (ZEE) from seeking any remedy(ies), directly or indirectly (through any proxies), before the NCLT, or any other court(s) or tribunal(s) in India or elsewhere, in connection with or arising out of the merger cooperation agreement (MCA), including in respect of or for the implementation of scheme, during the pendency of the contractual disputes amongst the parties under the MCA,"" Sony said in its plea to the SIAC.
The company contended that the NCLT is a statutory body and doesn't have the jurisdiction to adjudicate its contractual dispute with ZEE.
Sony's India units terminated the merger deal with ZEE on January 22 for alleged violation of the merger agreement and had also asked ZEE to pay $90 million in termination fees for the breach in implementing the closing conditions.

The termination fees has to be paid within 14 days from the termination date, as per the merger agreement between the two companies which has been reviewed by ET.
It is pertinent to note that ZEE and one of its shareholders Mad Man Film Ventures have moved the Mumbai bench of the NCLT seeking directions for Sony to implement the merger agreement.
Sony filed the application on January 22, 2024 seeking an emergency interim relief application under Rule 30 and Schedule I of the SIAC Rules and in terms of Clause 9.2.1 of the merger cooperation agreement (MCA).
The SIAC began hearing the matter on Wednesday.
It is pertinent to note that the merger agreement between
Sony Group
's India entities and ZEE requires both parties to inform the regulatory bodies within 15 days of the termination of the agreement.
Both Sony and ZEE now have time till February 6 to inform the Competition Commission of India (CCI), NCLT, and stock exchanges about the termination of the merger and that they don't intend to implement the merger.
As per the merger agreement, the two parties also have to withdraw all pending applications filed before governmental authorities, including the NCLT, for approval of the scheme or the transactions contemplated under the transaction documents.
The merger agreement allows both parties to terminate the agreement in the event of violation by the other party.
In its application to the SIAC, Sony noted that ZEE failed to satisfy many of its different and material closing conditions precedent even after 25 months had passed since the agreement was signed in December 2021.
It added that ZEE provided only piecemeal and partial proposals to address any of the material issues.

The communications between Sony's legal and M&A executives in India and Los Angeles with top Zee executives provide undisclosed details on the high-stakes backroom tussle that preceded the Japanese firm's Jan. 22 decision to pull the plug on the $10 billion merger.
Emails exchanged between Dec. 20 and Jan. 9 show executives from both companies accusing each other of not honouring the merger commitments. Zee executives repeatedly said that there was nothing out of line, and asked Sony to extend the closure deadline.
""A number of events, circumstances, state of facts, conditions have occurred, which have, or are reasonably likely to have a 'material adverse effect' on the business, operations,"" Drew Shearer, a top Los Angeles-based Sony executive wrote in an email.

Disney Star faces unusual fallout: A potential $2-billion downgrade by Reliance amidst Zee-Sony turmoil
A week later, on Dec. 27, Zee's top India counsel Shyamala Venkatachalam accused Sony of attempting to ""depict a narrative which has no basis in facts"", saying Zee was dismayed by what it called was a ""sudden volte face"" from the company in bad faith.
Spokespersons for Zee and Sony declined to comment.
The Zee-Sony merger, in the works for two years, would have created an Indian TV juggernaut with more than 90 channels across sports, entertainment and news that would have competed with the likes of Walt Disney and billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance.
The collapse of the deal is a bigger setback for Zee, one of India's best known TV networks that started in 1992 but has seen its business struggle over the years. Its shares have fallen 27% since the merger was called off.

Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy advisory firm InGovern which advocates for investor rights, said mutual funds and other investors who own 96% of Zee remain clueless as to why the merger collapsed, as the company has not disclosed any details. ""Investors deserve to know what went on behind scenes,"" he said.
Emails show there was a face-off between Sony and Zee about four Russian subsidiaries that dealt in content creation and distribution, as the merger agreement had stipulated no dealings with entities based in countries under U.S. sanctions. Russia is under Western sanctions for the Ukraine war.
In a Jan. 5 email, Erik Moreno, executive vice president for corporate development and M&A at Sony Pictures Entertainment said Zee had not ended ties with the Russian entities even though it was ""absolutely critical"", and the merged entity ""would under no circumstances inherit the Russian entities"".
Zee's counsel Venkatachalam responded by saying the divestment process had not been completed due to changing regulations in Russia and alternate structures were being explored, even though the business of those entities ""was shut down in December 2022"", emails showed.

DISNEY DEAL, SMALL LOAN
Reuters on Monday reported Sony's confidential termination notice which showed it accused Zee of also not meeting certain financial terms including required cash reserves. Zee denies those allegations.
The emails show another key sticking point was Zee's 2022 decision to enter into a $1.4 billion deal with Disney to purchase certain TV cricket rights for India.
Sony said Zee had decided to furnish a bank guarantee and a deposit totaling $406 million for that deal. And Zee's bid to take debt for the deal, which was ""without prior written consent"" of Sony, took the Indian firm's total debt to more than $451 million - above the merger agreement threshold.
Moreno wrote said in the Jan. 5 email that Sony had several times ""raised our concerns and reservations in relation to the (Disney) alliance agreement ... including, in respect of the consideration agreed to be paid"".
In response, Zee legal executive said that Sony's allegations were raised too late, and were ""reprehensible and unfortunate"". The cricket deal violated no merger conditions as the two sides wanted to encourage Zee's expansion into sports, it argued in the emails.
Reuters has reported that Zee has decided to terminate its cricket deal with Disney due to lack of funds.
Aside from the Disney deal, Sony accused Zee of several other merger agreement breaches, the emails show, including launching a new channel in South Africa during talks and granting a $3.3 million loan to an affiliate in India without specifying repayment term.
Zee said none of those things breached the deal terms. ""We have borne great costs to ensure a successful merger between our companies,"" Zee's Venkatachalam wrote in an email.

– Sony Group merger plan has been intriguing in many ways – for both the innumerable twists and turns and duration of the ultimately abortive process. Since the
opportunistic marriage ended in a divorce
, developments on the legal front are promising to be even more spectacular than what the union promised for India’s entertainment industry.
Soon after calling off the merger, Japan’s
Sony invoked the arbitration clause
in the contract and sought $90 million from Zee for breach of merger agreement. Parallelly,
Zee approached the National Company Law Tribunal
seeking an order to Sony to merge as approved by the Tribunal.

Zee pulls plug on $1.5-billion ICC TV rights deal with Disney
Can there be parallel legal proceedings – especially in a domestic court and at an international arbitration centre - over a broken contract?
What if the two pronounce conflicting orders?
Any significant corporate action must follow the procedure of taking approvals from the NCLT to ensure it complies with the provisions of the Companies Act and in the interests of minority shareholders if it is a listed company. While the approvals are necessary, can the NCLT order mandatory implementation of its approval when the underlying contract itself is dead?
In what appears to be a test case, an international arbitration is dealing with the basic issues of the performance of the contractual obligations, while the NCLT is being asked to deal with it from a different position.

Sony to enhance its India presence through organic, inorganic strategies: NP Singh
Here comes the role of the arbitration law. This legislation, The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is an act derived from Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). It aims to provide a fair and efficient arbitral procedure, while also minimising the role of judicial authority.
The evolution of jurisprudence in this segment is interesting from the time when domestic courts declared that they have the power to overrule international arbitral awards in the case of Bhatia International Vs Bulk Trading SA.
But it took a turn in the case of Enercon Vs Enercon GmBh, where the court recognised the minimal role for judicial intervention.
``It is a well-recognized principle of arbitration jurisprudence in almost all the jurisdictions, especially those following the UNCITRAL Model Law, that the Courts play a supportive role in encouraging the arbitration to proceed rather than letting it come to a grinding halt,’’ the Supreme Court said in the Enercon case. ``Another equally important principle recognized in almost all jurisdictions is the least intervention by the courts.’’

Zee needs strategy shift to survive after Sony merger plan crumbles
The role of the local judicial authority over arbitration proceedings in a foreign country was further clarified with amendments in 2015 after the Supreme Court ruling in the Balco Vs Kaiser Aluminium case in 2012. ``In a foreign seated international commercial arbitration, no application for interim relief would be maintainable under Section 9 or any other provision,’’ the Supreme Court ruled.
Subsequent to the Balco ruling, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction in Reliance Industries Ltd Vs Union of India over a London-seated arbitration.
With the Zee – Sony dispute playing out in multiple geographic jurisdictions and under multiple laws, developments over the years indicate that it may pay to have close watch over the arbitral proceedings in Singapore.

The merger was terminated due to disagreement over the leadership of the merged entity and unfulfilled closing conditions by Zee.
Zee has disputed Sony's allegations and has stated that it will put up a strong defence during the arbitration proceedings.
On January 22, Zee urged the Sony-owned entities to withdraw the termination notice and implement the merger scheme.
“The company has called upon Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment to immediately withdraw the termination and confirm that they will perform their obligations to give effect to and implement the Merger Scheme, sanctioned by the NCLT,” Zee had noted.
Zee had also approached the Mumbai bench of the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT), seeking directions for Sony to implement the merger scheme. The hearing on Zee's application has not yet taken place.
Meanwhile, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT on Tuesday gave Sony Group entities three weeks to respond to a plea filed by Mad Man Film Ventures, a Zee shareholder, seeking the tribunal's intervention in implementing the merger scheme.
The division bench of judicial member Lakshmi Gurung and technical member Charanjeet Singh Gulati, while allowing the Sony Group companies Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment three weeks to file their reply, has adjourned the matter to March 12.

The media baron also alleged that Sony intentionally prevented a merger despite the Zee promoters' offer - during extended negotiations - to have Punit Goenka step aside from the chief executive's post.
It is to be noted that
Punit Goenka, the Managing Director and CEO of Zee, owns a 4 per cent stake
in the company. A merger between Sony and Zee would’ve created a $10 billion broadcasting entity, India’s largest.
Rules say that any person with or without holding any shares in a listed target company, may offer to acquire shares of the entity subject to a minimum offer size of 26 per cent. Furthermore, any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least 10 per cent in a listed company may move a resolution to change its directors.

'Bordered' regulation to hurt Metaverse's seamless experience: Meta,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/bordered-regulation-to-hurt-metaverses-seamless-experience-meta/articleshow/107240164.cms,29-01-2024,"Taking a ""bordered approach"" in regulating the
metaverse
will hurt interoperability and portability of experiences that transcend national boundaries and operate across jurisdictions,
Meta
has cautioned the Indian regulator that is looking at proactive regulation of the
virtual
digital world.
Responding to a consultation paper released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
), the US social networking giant said the metaverse is subjected to international laws and standards and that India already has a solid legal framework that applies to internet technologies, such as the new
Digital
Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, which may continue to apply to the metaverse.
""It is important to remember that the metaverse is not being built in a regulatory vacuum: in fact, as the next evolution of the internet, it is already subjected to the wide range of laws, norms, principles and standards that already regulate today's internet and the technologies that power it,"" the Facebook parent said in a written submission to Trai's public consultation.
The metaverse should be interoperable for users to seamlessly navigate and travel between multiple online experiences, it said.
Onerous requirements for local storage of data may amplify challenges for startups building cross-border experience in a burgeoning sector such as the metaverse, it warned.

Instead, Indian policymakers should participate in international, multi-stakeholder efforts such as those by the Metaverse Standards Forum and the World Economic Forum to develop baseline technical standards, Meta said. Such initiatives are important to lower barriers to entry and facilitate market access by small firms and developers and enable them to compete globally in metaverse innovation, it said.
Meta called upon Indian policymakers to address any emerging legislative gaps as the metaverse evolves ""on a case-by-case basis, using evidence-based policy development"". ""This could take the form of regulatory sandboxes with clear exit criteria that allow industry participants to offer products to limited numbers of consumers in a more controlled environment,"" Meta said.
Meta recommended policymakers to undertake public-private partnerships on regulatory sandboxes for XR (extended reality) that can help ascertain if existing regulations, standards, and policies are robust enough for new products based on XR technologies.
Further, Meta said, the government must enable Wi-Fi in the 6 GHz spectrum band to enable the most innovative AR/VR (augmented reality and virtual reality) experience and for the country to compete with other geographies in metaverse innovation.
""The 6 GHz band is important for next generation Wi-Fi operations. The 1,200 MHz of spectrum between 5,925 MHz and 7,125 MHz provides more and wider channels than the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands and will enable low latency, high throughput communication,"" it said.
""Seven 160 MHz and three 320 MHz channels are critical for the metaverse, which often involve multiple users and densely populated networks,"" it said.

"Zee will sue Sony; promoter family to hike holding in Zee by 5 per cent, says Subhash Chandra",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-will-sue-sony-promoter-family-to-hike-holding-in-zee-by-5-per-cent-says-subhash-chandra/articleshow/107213173.cms,29-01-2024,"Subhash Chandra
, chairman emeritus of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
, has alleged that
Sony
intentionally prevented a merger despite the
Zee
promoters' offer - during extended negotiations - to have
Punit Goenka
step aside from the chief executive's post. Chandra said Zee intends to sue the Japanese company for damages. The Zee founder also told Vinod Mahanta & Javed Farooqui in an interview that the promoter family would be raising its stake in the company by 5% soon, to eventually total 26%. Edited excerpts.
So the stumbling block was that Sony didn't want Punit as CEO...
I am aware that some shareholders still believe that if Punit had stepped aside, Sony would have proceeded with the merger. We did present that option to Sony. On December 14-15, the matter was discussed within the family. Punit and the family collectively decided he should step aside, and the merger should proceed because it was beneficial for Zee. This decision was communicated to Sony. It wasn't acceptable to Sony. I believe this was Sony's strategy all along: To engage with Zee and eventually withdraw, portraying Zee as vulnerable. I intend to convey this perspective to the
Zee board
as well.
But Sony did, in fact, extend the deal by a month, to explore if there was any possibility of an agreement. It is now alleging that Zee didn't fulfil the merger conditions...
In arbitration and the NCLT case, it will be demonstrated that Zee has met the majority of conditions and prerequisites.
However, there are a couple of conditions that could only be finalised once the merger was actually completed. The reason for not fulfilling these conditions earlier was the
potential implications for Zee
, if the merger didn't go ahead as planned.
So, will Zee sue Sony for damages?

We will have to. If I were the CEO of the company, I would have sued them already. I can prove that it was Sony's criminal design to start the merger process and then withdraw. As a promoter, I am seriously considering filing a
criminal case against Sony
.
In the past few days, have you reached out to either the Ambanis or the Adanis for a possible alternative deal? Has any private
equity
firm made an offer?
I have not approached either of the groups. But Zee is an asset that cannot be replicated. There is a saying in Hindi that goes, ""When you have a beautiful daughter, there will be many suitors."" Indeed, several large private equity firms had approached, with offers to provide loans and increase promoter shareholding. Personally, I don't have any appetite for additional debt. I've worked hard to extricate myself from such situations, and it took me five years. Now, I lack the courage to take on more debt.
Is the promoter family looking at raising its stake?
Yes, the promoter family is indeed considering raising its stake in the company. I've personally encouraged both my immediate and extended family to increase their holdings in Zee. I've also approached my younger son, Amit Goenka, a successful NRI, and he has agreed to invest in Zee instead of other companies. While it may take some time, we are working toward acquiring an additional 5% soon - and eventually holding 26%.
Has Sebi called you personally regarding this investigation?
Yes, finally, they have. I will go and explain my position on every matter.
Zee's share price crashed 33% on January 23, and the market cap has fallen to Rs 15,680 crore. A lot of retailer investors suffered losses...
I was truly distressed that day, knowing so many people would suffer losses through no fault of their own. However, I believe the worst is behind us. On January 26, 2019, I gathered 38 lenders in our boardroom and assured them that I would repay them, asking only for some time. They granted me that time. Today, I'm conveying a similar message to our minority shareholders: Have patience for three to four quarters with Punit and the board, and you will see the results. The company will rebound to the levels it once achieved. At its peak, Zee's Ebitda was Rs 2,400 crore, and it will reach those numbers again. Zee is a complex organisation and Punit is still the best person to run it.
Do you expect Disney to sue Zee for breach of contract in the ICC TV rights deal case?
I expect some legal action. I am sure Disney will also be exploring some options.
Was Sony on board for buying the ICC rights?
I believe they were. Sony had sports channels in their bouquet. Zee's balance sheet does not support paying $1.4-1.5 billion for the ICC rights.
What are your options now that Sony has terminated its partnership with Zee? Is Zee currently seeking a financial or strategic partner?
I don't believe Zee needs any alternatives. There is no debt, no additional
working capital
requirement, so external assistance is not necessary. From the perspective of a founder-promoter, I can confidently say this is a unique selling point of Zee; it's in our DNA. We can generate profits from the resources at our disposal. I recall that in 1998-99, an analyst predicted that Zee wouldn't survive in this competitive environment. Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) was launched a year or two before that, which impacted Zee's ratings. However, Zee not only survived, but also thrived. Over the past two decades, numerous well-funded competitors have entered the space but couldn't dent Zee's position.
I firmly believe that content creation isn't solely dependent on money; it's about empowering creative minds and listening to their ideas from a viewer's perspective, rather than as the MD of the company. Whether Zee requires a strategic partner or an investor - that's a decision for Punit and the Zee board to make. If concerns arise about low shareholding potentially causing problems - like what Invesco did, by calling an EGM to replace the board or for any other reason - Punit and the board will have to decide.
Isn't Zee vulnerable to a hostile takeover, given that its market value has seen huge erosion? How do you plan to fend off such a move?
That's always a possibility. There are multiple companies in India, including some within the Tata group, where promoter-shareholders hold single-digit stakes. As a founder-promoter of this business, my message is that shareholders should give Punit nine to 12 months to demonstrate his abilities.
What was your reaction when Punit informed you about the deal for the first time?
I requested some time to contemplate it and asked Punit to clarify the reasons behind pursuing the deal. This decision was influenced by the ongoing Invesco episode, where there was an offer for a merger with Viacom18 from Reliance. While the deal appeared favourable for Punit and the family, it was not in the best interest of all shareholders. The Zee board, in its wisdom, pointed out that although it might benefit the promoter family, it would not be advantageous for minority shareholders, and as a founder member, I supported the board's stance.
Regarding the Sebi investigation, the regulator has stuck to its claim in a counter-affidavit to the appellate tribunal that Zee paid Rs 200 crore to seven entities linked to the Essel Group. Your comments...
Sebi said, 'You have siphoned off Rs 200 crore from Zee,' but my question is, where has the money gone? If money had been moved, in this day and age, there would have been a trail. I should have that money in my system somewhere. I have repaid Rs 40,000 crore-plus to banks. I have all the details available.
The current Zee board has been accused of turning a blind eye to corporate governance lapses. How do you respond to such allegations?
All I can say is that we might have committed some mistakes, and they can be termed as lapses; however, there was no intentional wrongdoing. The allegation that we have siphoned off money is not correct. I have repaid Rs 40,000-42,000 crore to banks and investors, and my security for that was just Rs 20,000 crore. I could have paid the sum, released the security, and for the rest of the amount, I could have simply stated that I didn't have the money. People might have filed cases, and I could have hired an army of lawyers to defend myself against the Rs 22,000 crore claim while retaining control of the companies I have had to sell. Why would I even have had to sell a stake in Zee?
Recently, two resolutions seeking the reappointment of independent directors Vivek Mehra and Sasha Mirchandani were defeated, as the proposals failed to get approval from 75% of shareholders. Doesn't this indicate shareholder dissatisfaction with the current board?
One director, Adesh Kumar Gupta, had withdrawn his candidature earlier, and a proxy firm had expressed concerns about another director serving on too many boards and audit committees. I reiterate that while there may have been corporate governance lapses, they were not intentional.

X implements restrictions on Taylor Swift searches amidst deep-fake image controversy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/x-implements-restrictions-on-taylor-swift-searches-amidst-deep-fake-image-controversy/articleshow/107208005.cms,28-01-2024,"(This story originally appeared in
on Jan 28, 2024)
Last week, explicit
AI-generated images
of
Taylor Swift
surfaced on
X
(formerly Twitter), causing a significant stir on social media. Responding to the outcry, X swiftly implemented measures to block
searches
for 'Taylor Swift.' The move comes amid growing concerns about the
platform
's
content moderation
and
safety protocols
.
Blocking 'Taylor Swift' Searches on X:
A Temporary Safety Measure:
A recent report by The Verge revealed that searches for ""Taylor Swift"" or ""Taylor Swift AI"" on X now yield a message without displaying any images. Independent verification by the Times of India-Gadgets Now team confirmed this restriction. Attempts to retrieve results with the same prompts led to a message stating, ""Something went wrong, but don't fret — it's not your fault."" However, altering the prompt to include terms like ""Taylor Swift AI images"" or ""Taylor Swift
deepfake
image"" produced a mix of images, including both originally captured and AI-generated non-explicit photos.
X's head of business, Joe Benarroch, acknowledged the blocking as a ""temporary"" measure aimed at prioritizing safety, according to The
Wall Street Journal
. The platform faced a surge in explicit images of the pop star circulating and being shared before the company began removing them. Some of these images garnered millions of views, with one reportedly reaching 47 million before being taken down.

The incident prompted criticism from various quarters, including politicians and tech CEOs. Microsoft's Satya Nadella was among those expressing concern over the development. The controversy surrounding AI-generated explicit content raises questions about the platform's ability to effectively manage and moderate user-generated content.
X's Strategic Move:
Hiring for Trust and Safety Office in Austin:
In response to mounting concerns, X has announced plans to hire 100 full-time employees for a new trust and safety office in Austin, Texas. This move is strategically timed, just days before company CEO Linda Yaccarino is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 31. The hearing will address X's approach to moderating child sexual exploitation content.
Content Moderation Challenges Post-Musk Takeover
Notably, the decision to establish a trust and safety office follows the aftermath of Elon Musk's takeover of the company. Musk made sweeping changes, including the dismissal of a significant portion of the staff responsible for flagging and removing inappropriate content from the platform. This restructuring has led to increased scrutiny and calls for more robust content moderation policies.
Amidst these developments, the incident involving Taylor Swift's AI-generated images highlights the ongoing challenges faced by social media platforms in maintaining a safe and secure online environment. The debate over content moderation and safety measures is expected to gain further attention as platforms like X navigate the complex landscape of user-generated content in the digital age.

Disney Star had recently sent an intimation to
Zee

ET had first reported on December 28 that there is uncertainty over the ICC TV deal since Zee had failed to submit financial commitments and guarantees to Disney Star. People close to Zee claimed that the deal was subject to the completion of its proposed merger with Sony. Disney Star officials have denied this claim.
Zee sources said the company had agreed to acquire the ICC rights in the hope that the merger with Sony would go through and the Japanese media conglomerate would infuse $1.57 billion into the merged entity.
Without the merger, Zee would find it difficult to service the
ICC TV rights deal
since it is facing pressure on its profitability due to a sluggishness in advertising and subscription revenues, media analysts tracking the sector said.
Sony units on January 22 terminated the merger deal with Zee and initiated arbitration proceedings against the Indian entertainment company before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), seeking $90 million in termination fees for an alleged breach of the merger agreement. Zee has denied Sony's allegations and has said it is contesting Sony's claims before the SIAC. The company has also approached the National Company Law Tribunal seeking directions for Sony to implement the merger agreement.

(ED) on Friday said it conducted searches on the premises of entities linked to
Essel Group
in connection with its probe into alleged
money laundering
involving
Religare Finvest Ltd
(RFL), a financial services firm of
Religare Group
.
According to the agency, the Religare group's financial services arm granted loans worth ₹150 crore to those Essel companies in March 2014, and these loans were allegedly defaulted by way of executing a fraudulent settlement agreement in January 2018 in connivance with the erstwhile management and officials of RFL and an entity named
Oscar Investments Ltd
.
ED conducted searches at three locations in Mumbai belonging to Konti Infrapower and Multiventures, Edison Infrapower and Multiventures, Asian Satellite Broadcast, Widescreen Holdings, M/s Jayneer Capital, Spirit Infrapower, and Multiventures and the residential premises of a former senior official of Essel group.
An Essel Group spokesperson said the agency conducted searches at two premises of the group pertaining to the enquiry regarding Religare Group. ""Essel Group extended complete co-operation to the officials and provided all the relevant documents and explanations,"" the person said.
""Essel Group wishes to state, as per the Panchnama, no 'incriminating' documents were found or seized. As far as the ₹150-crore loan is concerned, the same has been repaid/settled and there was no wrongful loss caused by Essel Group,"" the spokesperson said.

ED's money laundering case against erstwhile Religare promoters Malvinder and Shivinder Mohan Singh and its former chairman and managing director, Sunil Godhwani, is based on a case registered by the Delhi Police's Economic Offences Wing.

and
Culver Max Entertainment
have reached out to their employees to address their concerns following the collapse of the much-anticipated merger agreement between the two companies.
A day after Culver Max Entertainment CEO NP Singh addressed

employees through an internal email,
Zee Entertainment
managing director
Punit Goenka
also held a town hall meeting with the staff on Thursday.
In his address to the company's 3,000 employees, Goenka said there will be no job losses amid concerns that the company might initiate cost-cutting measures across TV and digital businesses to improve profitability.
Goenka also gave a clarion call to the employees to make
Zee
the top media company in India by nurturing entrepreneurial spirit and moulding themselves to the changing media landscape.
In an internal email on January 24, Sony's Singh said that the Sony-owned company will pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen its position in the Indian market.

Singh also assured employees that he and the senior management team are ""committed to setting the company up for a long-term, strong future"".
He also said that the change in the company's plans following the collapse of the merger deal with Zee will allow it to step into a phase of growth.
Two days after the merger collapse, Sony and Zee employees ET spoke to had mixed reactions.
Some employees said it has been business as usual for them in the last two years since both companies aggressively fought for market and revenue share as they were operating independently.
Some feel that the break-up of the merger deal is a missed opportunity since scale is the need of the hour amid the ongoing consolidation in the media industry and competition from technology giants in the space.

The federal agency said in a statement that three premises linked to Konti Infrapower and Multiventures Pvt Ltd, Edison Infrapower and Multiventures Pvt Ltd, Asian Satellite Broadcast Ltd, Widescreen Holdings Pvt Ltd, Jayneer Capital Pvt Ltd, Spirit Infrapower and Multiventures Pvt Ltd and the residential premises of a former senior official of the Essel Group (who was not named) were raided on Wednesday.
The Essel Group is promoted by media baron Subhash Chandra and owns stake in leading media and entertainment companies which includes - Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, Zee Media Corporation and Dish TV.
""The search has resulted in the recovery of incriminating documents and recording of spot statements of the officials of the companies under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA),"" the agency said in a statement.
An Essel group spokesperson, however, said no ""incriminating"" documents were seized during the raids on its two premises and that the company did no wrong.
""Essel Group extended complete cooperation to the officials and provided all the relevant documents and explanations.

""Essel Group wishes to state, as per the Panchnama, no 'incriminating' documents were found or seized,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.
As far as the Rs 150 crore
loan
is concerned, the same has been repaid/settled and there no wrongful loss was caused by Essel Group, the spokesperson said.
The
money laundering case
stems from an FIR registered by the EOW of the Delhi Police wherein Religare Finvest Ltd (RFL), a non-banking financial company of the Religare Group, made allegations against the four companies of hatching a criminal conspiracy for causing wrongful loss to RFL by defaulting on a loan of Rs 150 crore, it said.
The said loan of Rs 150 crore was given in March, 2014 to the Essel Group companies -- Rs 50 crore to Konti Infrapower and Multiventures Pvt. Ltd, Rs 40 crore to Widescreen Holdings Pvt Ltd, Rs 50 crore to Edison Infrapower and Multiventures Pvt Ltd and Rs 10 crore to Asian Satellite Broadcast Pvt Ltd, the agency said.
The
ED
alleged that the loan was ""defaulted"" by the above-mentioned companies by way of executing a fraudulent settlement agreement in January, 2018 in connivance with the erstwhile management and officials of RFL and an entity named Oscar Investments Ltd.
The agency earlier this month had conducted searches in this case and covered the corporate offices of RFL, M3M India Holdings, RHC Holding Pvt Ltd, Hillgrow Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, Dion Global Solutions and Prius commercial in Delhi-NCR.

Zee needs strategy shift to survive after Sony merger plan crumbles,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-needs-strategy-shift-to-survive-after-sony-merger-plan-crumbles/articleshow/107141576.cms,25-01-2024,"BENGALURU/MUMBAI: The collapse of a planned $10 billion merger with Sony's unit has heaped pressure on
Zee Entertainment
, one of India's most popular TV networks, to pursue deals with new partners or focus on areas such as
digital entertainment
to revive its fortunes.
A
Zee-Sony India merger
would have created a media powerhouse in the world's most populous nation with 90-plus channels across sports, entertainment and news segments, which, India's antitrust body at one time said could have ""un-paralleled bargaining power"" when backed by Sony's global reach.
But after two years of deal talks, the Japanese company this week scrapped the deal saying terms of its merger agreement were not met and is demanding $90 million in termination fees via arbitration. Zee denies any lapses and has started its own counter-challenge legally.
Both Sony and Zee lose out as the merger could have helped them emerge stronger in India's $28 billion media and entertainment space, especially when rivals - billionaire Mukesh Ambani's
Reliance
and Walt Disney - are holding merger talks for their
India media assets
.
But the scrapping of the merger and the legal fight with Sony is seen jolting Zee more as it already faces a host of regulatory, business and
financial challenges
, according to analysts and three industry executives with direct knowledge of its thinking.
Live Events
Zee's advertising revenues fell to $488 million for the 2022-23 year from around $600 million five years ago. Cash reserves dropped to $86 million from $116 million in that period.
Its CEO,
Punit Goenka
, is facing the market regulator's investigation for suspected diversion of company funds - allegations he has denied, but which became a key sticking point leading to the collapse of the Sony talks, Reuters reported earlier.
""Running Zee independently and reviving it looks tough. Lot of
stakeholder trust
has been eroded, rebuilding that is the priority,"" said one of the industry executives, who added Zee may need to now look for other buyers to revive itself.
Analysts at Emkay Global concurred, saying in a report this week Zee was likely to attract other suitors ""with 'going it alone' being a low-probability event"", adding ""the potential
Reliance-Disney merger
can further weaken Zee's position, leaving it at a vulnerable spot in the overall industry"".
A second industry source said Zee's top priority right now is to revive its business and challenge Sony's allegations legally.
Zee's shares have fallen 31.2% since the Sony deal collapse. Zee and Sony did not respond to requests for comment.
MELODRAMATIC HINDI DRAMAS
In a letter to employees, reviewed by Reuters, Sony India CEO N.P. Singh said this week the company ""will actively explore new organic and inorganic possibilities to strengthen"" its India presence.
Started in 1992 by CEO Goenka's father, Subhash Chandra, referred to as the ""Father of Indian television"", Zee was India's first private TV channel that quickly rose to become a household name by offering melodramatic Hindi dramas.
Shashi Shekhar Vempati, a former CEO of state-run Indian broadcaster Prasar Bharati, said Zee could still leverage its archival library of popular shows, create more entertainment content which is its ""core strength"", and promote its streaming platform that has lagged market leaders such as Netflix .
Zee digital revenues were 9% of its overall revenues in 2022-23, much lower than 16% for Disney India and 15% for Sony, analysts at India's Ambit Capital said in a report.
""Zee hasn't lost its core strength of producing compelling entertainment content, which it should focus on,"" Vempati said, adding they could ""carve out a niche"" with their digital streaming platform.

A game of bluff scuttled Sony-Zee’s plans to create $10 billion media giant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/a-game-of-bluff-sscuttled-sony-zees-plans-to-create-10-billion-media-giant/articleshow/107128747.cms,25-01-2024,"In November,
Sony Group
Corp.’s lawyers got a nasty surprise during a routine call from the legal team of
Zee Enterprises
Entertainment Ltd.
Nearly two years into tortuous merger negotiations to create a $10 billion Indian entertainment giant, Zee wanted the Japanese company to agree to a so-called “hold harmless” clause for its Chief Executive Officer,
Punit Goenka
, just weeks before the Dec. 21 deal deadline.
Already wary of Goenka, who had been accused of financial impropriety by India’s markets regulator several months earlier, Sony executives wondered why he requested indemnity.
On his part, Goenka was worried that Sony would start a witch hunt against him after the merger was completed and it got what it wanted: access to Zee’s deep library of local entertainment content.
The account of this weeks-long stalemate was pieced together by speaking to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the talks were private.

Sony-Zee: How and why curtains fell on a mega media deal that was two years in making
Goenka was refusing to relinquish the CEO role of the merged entity, and Sony no longer was willing to move forward with him at the helm. By Jan. 19, when Sony’s board members met in Tokyo, the deal was dead in the water. A 62-page termination letter was sent to Zee on Jan. 22, citing non-fulfillment of some pre-requisite conditions outlined in the merger pact.
Disproportionate Influence
The aborted deal underscores the challenges facing foreign companies attempting to crack the biggest entertainment market in Asia. A culture gap and the disproportionate influence that India’s founding generation of company honchos still wield over their companies continue to stymie those wanting access to a $25 billion market.
“Cross-border transactions in India represent a challenge, mostly stemming from differences in corporate culture, accounting practices and reporting standards,” said Utkarsh Sinha, managing director at Bexley Advisors, a Mumbai-based boutique investment bank. “There’s a bridge to cross,” but also a “pot of gold” in the form of the Indian demographic, he said.

In Ayodhya, Zee boss Punit Goenka dubs Sony deal termination as 'a sign from the Lord'
Representatives for Sony and Zee didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comments on issues that scuppered the deal.
While Sony’s India head sought to rally the morale of his employees in a letter Wednesday, it was thin on details on how it plans to fend off rivals. Walt Disney Co. is talking to Reliance Industries Ltd. to combine its India operations, creating India’s largest entertainment company.
With Sony and Zee’s collapse, the Reliance-Disney entity “will have all the might in the market,” said Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara Securities India. “They will become the preferred platform for advertisers and content creators, which in turn will give them pricing power in the market.”
Miffed Bosses
Sony bosses in the US and Japan were also miffed when Zee made an exchange filing on Dec. 17 seeking a deadline extension without any conversations with them, another person familiar said.

The tiff started soon after Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, said in June that Goenka and his father,
Subhash Chandra
, had “abused their position” and siphoned off funds “for their own benefit.” The regulator also barred them from holding any executive or director positions in listed firms while its investigation was underway.
In October, an appellate authority gave partial relief to Goenka from Sebi’s ban, allowing him to hold these positions during the probe.
Zee saw this appellate win as a green-light for Goenka to be CEO of the merged entity, but Sony disagreed.
The tycoon offered to be the interim CEO while a search committee could be instituted to scout for another candidate, according to people familiar with the matter, but Sony now wanted to appoint N.P. Singh, its head of India operations, as CEO.
Game of Bluff
The months that followed were like a game of bluff.
Goenka expected Sony to relent since Zee’s was the only sizeable media asset in the market that could bolster the Japanese company’s less than 10% market share. Zee, with 17% share in Indian television market, has a rich library of regional language content and dozens of local television channels.
Sony expected Zee to blink given its deteriorating financial health — profit for the year ended March 31 dropped 95% — and the debts Chandra and Goenka needed to pay off. Also, with the founders only holding a 4% stake in Zee, Sony hoped that larger shareholders would prevail upon Goenka to step aside.
After the deal was called off, Zee’s stock nosedived 30% during trading in Mumbai Tuesday and at least ten brokerages, including CLSA, downgraded recommendations on the stock. Some investors could still be hoping to revive the deal.
“There is also some likelihood of the shareholders - top five owning about 30% put together — who may work together to do the deal with Sony” without Goenka, Elara’s Taurani said.
White Knight Sony
It’s not Goenka’s first rodeo.
Funds managed by Atlanta-based Invesco Ltd., once Zee’s biggest shareholder with an 18% stake, had also waged a fight in 2021 to remove Goenka from the board and as CEO, saying the company’s founders were enriching themselves at the expense of ordinary shareholders.
Ironically, Sony was Zee’s white knight then and its merger deal helped calm down Invesco, which has since pared most of its stake in the Indian company.
Since mid-December, Goenka has been holding closed-door meetings at his 16th floor office in the central district of Mumbai with his key lieutenants including Shyamala Venkatachalam and Vikas Somani, according to people familiar with the matter. Zee’s legal advisor for the deal was also contacted several times.
Unlike his father who was known for angry outbursts, soft-spoken Goenka has looked calm and unflappable to those who met him or spoke to him in the days leading up to the termination.
In fact, on Jan. 22 — the day he received the termination notice and exactly 25 months to the date the merger was announced — Goenka was in the holy city of Ayodhya, as a VIP guest of the Indian government that was inaugurating a new temple.
In a post that day on X, formerly known as Twitter, Goenka wrote that the Sony deal going kaput was “a sign from the Lord.”

"New plot: Zee, Sony launch legal war",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/new-plot-zee-sony-launch-legal-war/articleshow/107127950.cms,25-01-2024,"Mumbai: Two days after their two-year-long efforts to merge were called off, broadcasters
Zee
and
Sony
went at each other in legal forums in India and Singapore, claiming breach of contract.
Sony Group companies Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment (BEPL) initiated arbitration proceedings against
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
before
Singapore International Arbitration Centre
(SIAC), while Zee, denying charges, approached
National Company Law Tribunal
(
NCLT
) in Mumbai, seeking directions that the merger scheme, previously approved by the forum, be implemented.
In a filing to exchanges, Zee, while confirming that Sony has initiated arbitration proceedings against the company before SIAC, said it has initiated appropriate legal action to contest Culver Max and BEPL's claims and has also called upon the two Sony-owned entities to withdraw the termination notice.
On January 22, Sony terminated the merger agreement with Zee and asked the company to pay a $90 million
termination fee
for alleged breach of the merger agreement. While invoking arbitration, Sony is seeking emergency interim relief against Zee.
The merger was called off over differences on who would be the CEO of the merged entity. The Sony Group-owned companies had also contended that the closing conditions for the merger were not satisfied, leading to the termination of the agreement.

Zee has also denied Sony's allegation of breach of its obligations under the merger cooperation agreement (MCA) and reiterated that it has complied with all its obligations in good faith.
""The company has denied that Culver Max and BEPL are entitled to terminate the MCA, and the claim for termination fee is legally untenable and has no basis whatsoever. The company asserted that Culver Max and BEPL are in default of their obligations to give effect to and implement the Scheme, sanctioned by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal,"" it added.
ET first reported on November 4 that Sony was not comfortable having Zee's Punit Goenka as the CEO of the proposed merged entity since he continues to be under a Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) probe for alleged diversion of Zee funds to promoter companies. Sony instead wanted its executive, NP Singh, in that role.
Explaining the next steps in the arbitration proceedings, a media lawyer tracking the development said the two companies would have provided for a seat of arbitration, which could potentially be Mumbai. The SIAC has appointed arbitrators across the world.
""Now if the parties have already decided on an arbitrator, then the SIAC will be notified, and they will commence arbitration proceedings formally with the setting up of this tribunal,"" the lawyer, requesting anonymity, added.
""But if the parties have not identified the nominee arbitrators, then Sony will request the SIAC to set up the arbitration tribunal, and once that tribunal is set up, there will be a formal hearing to set the calendar for the arbitration.""
Ashish K Singh, managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal, said, ""SIAC has a specific procedure for the appointment of an arbitrator in urgent matters, and both parties will get a fair opportunity to contest their claims.""
""However, NCLT's decision will certainly play a crucial role in the entire matter,"" he further added.
Sudip Mahapatra, partner at S&R Associates, said, ""If both parties pursue litigation, this will result in lengthy legal proceedings. The parties might be better off reaching an amicable solution.""
Zee stock nosedived by almost 33% on January 23 to a 52-week low of Rs 152.5 after the termination of the merger agreement by Sony. The stock rebounded 6.7% to Rs 166.35 on Wednesday.
The termination of the merger deal and the subsequent crash in Zee's stock price have raised concerns among institutional and retail investors about the future of the company.

What's next for Zee Entertainment, promoter family, and Punit Goenka
The merger cooperation agreement (MCA) had been signed on December 21, 2021, and was valid for two years, extendable by a month for ""good-faith"" negotiations. That deadline expired with Sony unwilling to accede to Zee's demand for another six months to resolve the matter.
""Although we engaged in good-faith discussions to extend the end date under the merger cooperation agreement, we were unable to agree upon an extension by the January 21 deadline,"" the company said in a statement.
The deal is said to have failed over ZEEL MD and CEO Goenka's candidature for the top job at the merged company, given that he's facing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). As ET first reported on November 4 last year, the Japanese side had proposed that NP Singh, an old Sony hand, be picked for the role instead.

Last-ditch effort
In a last-ditch effort, Goenka had even called up senior Sony Pictures Entertainment executive Ravi Ahuja to try and sort out matters, said people aware of the matter.
Goenka, who was in Ayodhya on Monday to attend the consecration of the Ram mandir, posted on X: ""The deal that I have spent two years envisioning and working towards has fallen through, despite my best and most honest efforts. I believe this to be a sign from the Lord. I resolve to move ahead positively and work towards strengthening Bharat's pioneering M&E company for all its stakeholders.""
The deal was originally planned to conclude at the end of FY22. However, delays in Competition Commission of India (CCI) approval, coupled with legal and regulatory challenges faced by the ZEEL promoters, ensured that the transaction kept getting delayed.

The development is a setback for both companies. Along with other traditional broadcasters, they are staring at shrinking linear TV profitability and widening losses from the streaming business.
Media veteran Kunal Dasgupta, who had earlier served as CEO of Sony's India media entity, said it will have to remain content with a smaller, albeit, profitable business.
""Sony might look to acquire digital assets, while Zee will have to find another white knight,"" he said. ""The market has become very difficult for traditional broadcasters as their valuations have come under pressure due to the rise of digital.""
A Sony-ZEEL combine would have been India's largest media company after Disney Star, which is currently in merger talks with Reliance Industries-owned Viacom18.
Twists and turns
The biggest jolt to the deal came when the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), while setting aside the Sebi order barring Goenka from holding the top position in the merged entity, allowed the regulator to continue its probe against him over alleged diversion of ZEEL funds. Sony was not comfortable having Goenka at the helm from a corporate governance point of view, said the people cited above.
The company suggested that Singh lead the merged entity and complete the integration of two culturally diverse organisations.
To be sure, Zee said Goenka had agreed to give up the leadership position of the merged company in the interests of the merger.
Goenka ""was agreeable to step down in the interest of the merger and proposals in this regard were discussed, including for appointment of a director on the board of the merged company, protections for conduct of pending investigations and legal proceedings in the best interest of ZEEL's directors and shareholders and the consequent modifications to the scheme to incorporate the same,"" ZEEL said in its statement.
That assurance doesn't seem to have satisfied Sony.
""Sony was worried about the corporate governance blowback that the MNC could attract in Japan in the future if Goenka kept getting into trouble with regulators - and also they were getting increasingly concerned that Goenka would run the company as per his personal entrepreneurial style and not follow the corporate process-driven style that the corporation followed,"" said a person close to the deal.
Zee's top financial investors such as ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (7.29%), Nippon India Life Asset Management (6.12%), HDFC Mutual Fund (5.26%), and LIC (5.12%) were tracking developments. They had multiple calls with the Zee management on developments, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Now what?
Goenka has a few options still open, according to people close to ZEEL. In the last few days, he has been approached by some investors, according to them. A financial investor has offered to invest and discussions were also held with a powerful business group. Some possible partnerships with regional groups are also being looked at, they said.
""I think Punit has made up his mind,"" said a senior executive at Zee on condition of anonymity. ""He will bring in an investor and restructure the business, keeping in mind the changes in the market, namely the Reliance-Disney deal and losses in digital businesses. His first order of the day now will be cutting down the Zee losses to a third in the next few months. He is not looking at a strategic partner for now, but he has a trick up his sleeve.""
NV Capital managing partner Nitin Menon said the collapse of the plan has implications for M&A deals in the media space.
""We will have to see if this will lead to a realignment in the mergers and acquisitions space,"" he said. ""Given the uncertainty over the last two years, it looks like the market might tilt towards becoming a seller's market, with content owners having a slight advantage when it comes to pricing their products given that the merger has fallen off.""
Publicis Groupe South Asia CEO Anupriya Acharya said M&A deals, especially those involving big companies, are challenging because of the scale and complexities.
""Plus, the two parties need to agree on the objectives of the M&A activity, shared vision and the future of the merged entity, cultural and integration issues, etc,"" Acharya said. ""Something that looks good on paper may not necessarily get concluded.""

ZEEL spent Rs 366.6 crore on compliances for its merger with Sony,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zeel-spent-rs-366-6-crore-on-compliances-for-its-merger-with-sony/articleshow/107059562.cms,24-01-2024,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises
Ltd (
ZEEL
) spent Rs 366.59 crore on compliances till September 2023 for its now-failed merger with
Sony
, which called off the deal on Monday. The company had spent Rs 176.20 crore in the financial year that ended in March 2023. Besides, it spent Rs 190.39 crore in the first six months of the current fiscal, according to a regulatory filing by the Subhash Chandra family-promoted media entity.
After signing an agreement, ZEEL was racing to receive a series of regulatory clearances from SEBI, CCI, ROC, etc.
It also got a go-ahead from the
National Company Law Tribunal
after receiving approvals from shareholders and creditors and closed all formalities for the merger.
However, Sony Group Corp on Monday called off the USD 10 billion merger of its India unit with Zee Entertainment, following a stalemate over who will lead the merged entity, besides not satisfying other conditions for the merger.
It sent a termination notice to Zee on the deal, which was announced more than two years back, and is seeking USD 90 million as break-up fees for violating the terms of the merger pact and ""invoking arbitration"", which ZEEL said it will contest legally.

According to experts, this would bring the stock of ZEEL under pressure in near terms.
The industry dynamics are also going to change as global media giant Walt Disney Co has signed a non-binding agreement last month with billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries for a mega merger of their broadcasting businesses.
Had it been completed, the Zee-Sony merger would have been the biggest deal in the media and entertainment sector in India, creating one of the largest entities having over 100 channels and two leading OTT platforms.
The merged entity would have competed Disney Star with leading media houses as Star which called off merger and other rival OTT platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.
""Sony which has around 7-8 per cent market share and ZEEL with around 16 per cent market share, the ideal situation would be a merger because the industry dynamics for the rest of the players are changing dramatically,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities Executive Director Abneesh Roy.
With the deal collapsing, both Sony and ZEEL will get marginalised, while Disney-Star and Network18 would have a strong market share of almost over 35 per cent, he added.
Similarly, Karan Taurani, SVP of Elara Capital, said: ""We believe the termination will have a negative impact on both parties, as both companies are going through stiff competition from digital media and face a potential threat from the merger of RIL/Disney over the near term.""
ZEEL has reported a muted performance in terms of growth and profitability over the last two years, as revenue growth has converged to 2.2 per cent and EBITDA margin dipped to 10.2 per cent due to losses in the OTT segment and lower growth in the linear TV segment.
The Chandra family-promoted firm has also signed a contract with Disney for ICC tournament rights on the linear TV side and yet to pay the first tranche of USD 1.4 billion fee.
Disney-Star India business consists of a linear network of Star India and 70 television channels running in eight languages and the OTT platform Disney+ Hotstar.
Reliance Industries through its step-down firm Viacom 18 has around 38 channels. Besides, it has streaming platform JioCinema, which had earlier this year bagged the media rights, both digital and TV, to broadcast India's domestic matches as well as all the domestic tournaments hosted by BCCI for the next five years.
If the Sony-Zee merger was completed, the combined entity would have owned over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV) and two film studios (
Zee Studios
and Sony Pictures Films India), making it the largest entertainment network in India.

Sony seeks $90 million termination fee from Zee for alleged breaches of merger agreement,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-seeks-90-million-termination-fee-from-zee-for-alleged-breaches-of-merger-agreement/articleshow/107047862.cms,22-01-2024,"Sony Group Corporation-owned
Culver Max
Entertainment is seeking a termination fee of $90 million from Zee Entertainment Enterprises on account of alleged breaches of the terms of the Merger Co-operation Agreement (MCA), Zee said in a statement to the stock exchange.
Zee has refuted Sony's allegations of
MCA breach
, stating that it holds all rights in the matter, suggesting legal action may be taken. It also said Sony is invoking arbitration under the MCA and seeking
emergency interim reliefs
against the company.
Sony today terminated the merger agreement with Zee following the expiry of the one-month
good faith negotiation
period on January 21. The two-year agreement between the two companies to complete the merger ended on December 21, 2023. In December 2021, the two companies signed an agreement to merge their
TV and digital businesses
.
""We wish to inform you that the Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held today i.e. January 22, 2024 took note of communications dated January 22, 2024, received from Culver Max and BEPL (a) purporting to terminate the MCA and seeking termination fee of USD 90,000,000 on account of alleged breaches by ZEEL of the terms of the MCA, and (b) invoking arbitration against the Company and seeking emergency interim reliefs against the Company,"" Zee said.
""The Company categorically refutes all claims and assertions made by Culver Max and BEPL regarding alleged breaches of the MCA by ZEEL, including their claims for the termination fee, and reserves all its rights in this matter,"" Zee said.

""The Company is evaluating all available options and basis the guidance received from the Board and will take all necessary steps to safeguard the
long-term interests
of its stakeholders, including by taking appropriate legal action and contesting Culver Max and BEPL’s claims in the arbitration proceedings,"" it added.
In a separate statement, Zee's board noted that all efforts and steps were taken by ZEEL in line with the MCA, approved by its shareholders and all regulatory authorities. ZEEL has consistently worked towards the implementation of the mentioned scheme in the interest of the shareholders. ZEEL also held several deliberations and good faith negotiations with Culver Max and BEPL, to consider an extension of the merger completion timeline, which did not materialise.
ZEEL’s Board of Directors is evaluating all the available options. Basis the guidance received from the Board, ZEEL will take all the necessary steps to protect the long-term interests of all its stakeholders, including by taking appropriate legal action and contesting Culver Max and BEPL’s claims in the arbitration proceedings.
ZEEL inked the Merger Co-operation Agreement with Culver Max and BEPL on 21st December 2021, concerning the Composite Scheme of Arrangement, which was approved by the Mumbai bench of the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on 10 and 11 August 2023, respectively.
Under the MCA, ZEEL exercised its right to require Culver Max and BEPL to enter into good faith negotiations for 30 days to arrive at a mutual agreement on the extension of the end date by a reasonable period for completion of the transaction as per the terms of the MCA.
During this period, despite conducting numerous deliberations in good faith, the parties failed to arrive at a consensus on the purported pending conditions precedent that required action on the part of both ZEEL and Culver Max, Bangla Entertainment under the terms of the MCA.
Confirming ET's newsbreak, the company said Punit Goenka, MD & CEO of ZEEL, was agreeable to step down in the interest of the merger, and proposals in this regard were discussed, including for the appointment of a director on the Board of the merged company, protections for the conduct of pending investigations and legal proceedings in the best interest of ZEEL’s directors and shareholders and the consequent modifications to the scheme to incorporate the same.
""ZEEL proposed an extension of a maximum period of six months for the consummation of the transaction, however, Culver Max did not provide any counter-proposal for an extension. These discussions did not result in any proposal from Sony but they rather have chosen to terminate,"" it added.
ZEEL said it has displayed utmost commitment towards the merger by undertaking several permanent and irreversible steps, resulting in one-time and recurring costs for ZEEL.
The company also said it continues to evaluate organic and inorganic opportunities for growth, leveraging the intrinsic value of its assets.
ZEEL Chairman R. Gopalan said, “The Board of Directors has taken note of Sony’s letters purporting to terminate the Merger Co-operation Agreement, on the Company’s proposed merger with and into Culver Max Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, invoking arbitration and seeking interim reliefs. We are evaluating the next steps and considering the appropriate course of action. The Board has noted that the Company took all the required steps in the course of its integration journey over the last two years, to ensure that the scheme is implemented at the earliest.
""That said, the Board would like to assure its stakeholders that the Company will take all the necessary actions, in the best interest of all stakeholders, including by taking appropriate legal action and contesting Culver Max and BEPL’s claims in the arbitration proceedings. The Board has complete faith in the highly experienced senior management of the Company and will continue to guide the team. We recognize and value the trust our shareholders and stakeholders place in us, and we express gratitude for their continued support.”

Deadline over; Sony not keen to extend good faith negotiations with Zee. $10 bn merger terminated
In December 2021, Sony and Zee had signed definitive agreements to merge. Sony was to indirectly hold a majority of 50.86% of the combined company; the founders of ZEEL would hold 3.99%; and the other ZEEL shareholders were to hold a 45.15% stake. The deal was anticipated to conclude in 8-10 months. However, two years down the line, it remained incomplete due to regulatory investigation and legal suits, among other things, involving Zee and its promoters including MD & CEO Punit Goenka.
""Sony Pictures Networks India Private Ltd. (“SPNI”) (now known as Culver Max Entertainment Limited), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation (“Sony”), today issued a notice terminating the definitive agreements entered into by SPNI and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. (“ZEEL”) relating to the merger of ZEEL with and into SPNI (the “Merger”), which was previously announced on December 22, 2021,"" the company said in a statement.
The agreements said that if the merger didn't happen within 24 months after they were signed (called the ""End Date""), the parties had to talk about extending this End Date in a fair way. They needed to have these discussions for a month after the End Date (called the ""Discussion Period""). The agreements also said that if, by the end of the Discussion Period, they couldn't agree on an extension, any party could end the agreements by sending a written notice.
The merger didn't happen by the End Date because certain conditions needed for the merger to be completed were not met by then, Sony said.

Sony stays mum on Zee's request for merger deadline extension
""SPNI has been engaged in discussions in good faith to extend the End Date but the Discussion Period has expired without an agreement upon an extension of the End Date. As a result, on January 22, 2024, SPNI issued a notice to ZEEL terminating the definitive agreements,"" the company said.
If the deal was finalized,
it would have contributed to the expansion of Sony's media business
in the world's most populous country and a fast-growing market. Sony would boast over 75 television channels, securing a market share of 37%, surpassing Disney-owned Star's 24%, as per Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. The Sony-Zee alliance would have entered into direct competition with the impending Reliance-Disney joint venture, creating a near-duopoly scenario.
Reports of likely termination of the merger deal had started coming in from early this January, but
Zee had denied such speculations
and hoped that the merger would go through.
Karan Taurani, senior VP at Elara Securities, said the termination will have a negative impact on both the companies, as they are facing stiff competition from digital media. Sony and Zee also face a potential threat from the merger of RIL/Disney over the near term, he added.
Sony chose not to continue with the negotiations
for the lapses by Zee in complying with what are called conditions precedents (CP) in legalese and for the failing financial health of Zee Entertainment.
This had contributed to the ongoing dissatisfaction among the potential partners, ET repoted earlier. They also didn't reach an agreement on appointing ZEEL MD Punit Goenka as the CEO of the merged entity, until he’s cleared of charges that he siphoned off money from the publicly-traded firm to closely held companies owned by his family’s Essel Group. Currently, the Goenka family holds 3.99% equity in ZEEL, with the remaining shares owned by public and institutional stakeholders.
Insiders at Sony had revealed that the multinational has proposed offering Goenka the position of an advisor at the new company. However, Sony suggested that he should not be part of the board until regulatory investigations are concluded.
Sony wanted NP Singh, its India MD and CEO, to assume the role of chief executive for the new entity temporarily. This would be the case unless Goenka is cleared of all pending cases.
Sony today said it has not included the impact of the Merger in its consolidated financial results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, which was announced on November 9, 2023, and does not anticipate any material impact on its consolidated financial results as a result of the termination of the definitive agreements for the Merger.

This has been adding to the to the simmering discontentment between the suitors, who thus far couldn’t agree on ZEEL MD Punit Goenka being the CEO of the merged entity, until he’s cleared of charges that he siphoned off money from the publicly-traded firm to closely held companies owned by his family’s Essel Group. The Goenka family owns 3.99% equity in ZEEL. The rest are owned by public and institutional shareholders.
People close to Sony said the multinational has offered Goenka the role of advisor at the new company, but said he should not be on the board, pending regulatory investigations.
Sony has been rooting for
NP Singh
, its India MD and CEO, as chief executive of the new entity in the interim, unless Goenka is exonerated in all pending cases.
ET was the 1st to report on January 9 that Sony was on the brink of halting the deal. On January 19th it was also the first to report Group Corp had called for a board meeting last Friday, where it’s expected to take a call on the merger and that a likely termination was expected as early as Monday January 22nd or January 23rd.
Some were expecting a last minute change of heart from Goenka though sources close to Sony said it's unlikely to take place. Moreover, even if Goenka agrees to step down on January 19, the various CPs will have to be audited, and final adjustments made to the company’s finances. Since the merger was announced, Zee’s net profit has plummeted to Rs 48 crore in FY23, from Rs 956 crore in FY22 and Rs 793 crore in FY21.
The termination is likely to stir shareholder activism, believe many market participants. Indian mutual funds and insurance companies including LIC own 31% of the company.

Continuing to work towards successful closure of merger with Sony: Zee Entertainment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/continuing-to-work-towards-successful-closure-of-merger-with-sony-zee-entertainment/articleshow/106995015.cms,19-01-2024,"Zee Entertainment
Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) on Friday said it is continuing to work towards a successful
closure
of its
USD 10 billion
merger with
Culver Max Entertainment
, formerly known as Sony Pictures Networks India, amid reports that the Japanese entity's board meeting to take a call on the fate of the protracted deal. In a regulatory filing, ZEEL said it was ""not aware of, and cannot comment on"" any board meeting held or proposed to be held by Culver Max Entertainment, given that these are internal matters of Sony.
""We wish to reiterate that the Company is committed to the
merger
with Sony and is continuing to work towards a successful closure of the
proposed merger
and is engaging in
good faith negotiations
with Sony with a view to discuss the extension of the date required to make the Scheme effective, by a reasonable period of time,"" it said.
The fate of the USD 10 billion merger between ZEEL and Culver Max Entertainment is hanging by a slim thread with the two parties yet to finalise a closure agreement as the end of the one-month grace period for extension of negotiations looms.
The one-month grace period for extended negotiations will end on January 20.
According to some reports, the bone of contention is the driving seat of the merged entity. As per the agreed terms & conditions, ZEEL's Punit Goenka was to lead the merged entity.
Live Events
However, Sony has expressed concerns following market regulator SEBI barring Goenka from holding managerial posts in Zee and any of the entities in connection to a fund-diversion case.
Though the SEBI order was stayed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Sony is not comfortable with Goenka leading the merged entity during the probe due to the stringent corporate governance policy in Japan.
The deal which was signed between Zee Entertainment and Sony Pictures Networks India in 2021 has a stipulated period of two years in which the merger was to be completed before December 21, 2023, including regulatory and other approvals with a grace period of one month to complete the transaction.
On December 17, Subhash Chandra family promoted firm had sought an extension in the December 21, 2023 deadline from Sony Group Corporation (SGC) firm Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd (BEPL) under the Merger Cooperation Agreement dated December 22, 2021.
Earlier Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) stated that it has not yet agreed to a deadline extension requested by ZEEL for their merger proposed USD 10-billion merger, however, a day after it agreed to discuss.
The proposed USD 10-billion merger of ZEEL, BEPL and CMEPL has received regulatory approvals from the fair trade regulator CCI, bourses NSE and BSE, shareholders and creditors of the company.
In August this year, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also gave a go-ahead to the merger of ZEEL and Culver Max Entertainment.
This followed an interim order by Sebi barring Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd MD and CEO Punit Goenka from holding the position of a director or key managerial personnel in any listed company. The market regulator took action after they were found diverting funds from the company.
Chandra and Goenka moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) challenging the Sebi interim order. In October, SAT quashed the Sebi interim order.
In September 2021, then Sony Pictures Networks India and ZEEL had entered into a non-binding term sheet to bring together their linear networks, digital assets, production operations and programme libraries.
If the deal is through, then the combined entity will own over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV) and two film studios (Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India), making it the largest entertainment network in India.
Subsequently, the two parties signed a definitive agreement for their merger in December 2022.
The majority of the board of directors of the combined entity would be nominated by the Sony Group and include the current SPNI Managing Director and CEO N P Singh.

Zee-Sony Merger: Fate on creation of $10 bn media giant likely to be decided today,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-calls-board-meeting-today-for-zee-merger-call-as-10-bn-deal-stares-at-termination-unless-last-minute-breakthrough-reached/articleshow/106970712.cms,19-01-2024,"Sony
Group Corp has called for a board meeting on Friday, where it’s expected to take a call on the $10-billion merger of its India operations with
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
, said people with knowledge of the matter. Subsequently, it may inform the Tokyo Stock Exchange early next week of the possible termination of the plan, they said.
The deal was announced two years ago, in a bid to create the country’s largest broadcast company.
Two key meetings are set to be held back-to-back, said the people cited. Culver Max Entertainment, formerly Sony Pictures Networks India, is likely to hold a board meeting on Thursday night, followed by Sony at its Tokyo headquarters.
Sony is expected to pass a resolution to end the “good faith discussions,” thereby calling off the planned amalgamation, unless
Zee
managing director and chief executive
Punit Goenka
agrees he won’t assume current titles at the merged company.
Bid to Resolve Outstanding Issues
The resolution is also likely to call for all outstanding condition precedents (CPs) to be met. The latter are said to have complicated the already-strained relationship between the two sides.
Live Events
People close to Zee, however, said negotiations are ongoing, and both sides are trying to resolve all outstanding issues to make the deal work. They added that all operational CPs have been fulfilled.
However, those close to Sony said that even if Goenka agrees to step down on January 19, the various CPs will have to be audited, and final adjustments made to the company’s finances. Since the merger was announced, Zee’s net profit has plummeted to Rs 48 crore in FY23, from Rs 956 crore in FY22 and Rs 793 crore in FY21.
“It is very clear now that Goenka cannot be heading the new company,” said an executive close to negotiations. “If the merger was to go ahead, he has to step down on the day the amalgamation is actually complete and a new merged company is born.”
Sony’s holding in the combined entity is to be 53%. It also agreed to invest $1.6 billion to expand footprint.
On Thursday, Zee Entertainment stock rallied over 7% intraday after a media report suggested Culver Max and Zee had held discussions on completion of the merger, and that Goenka had offered to give up the chief executive role at the merged entity. The scrip ended 1% higher on the BSE, at Rs 248.15 apiece.
People close to Zee said Goenka has made no such commitment. They argue his appointment as MD and CEO of the new company is a key part of the composite agreement. Any change will have to be voted on afresh by shareholders and require approval of the board, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the stock exchanges.
There was no communication to the exchanges from Zee in this regard as of press time on Thursday.
“The company does not comment on media speculation,” the Zee Entertainment spokesperson told ET in a written response. Sony Corp’s global spokesperson didn’t respond to queries.
ET reported on January 9 that Sony was on the brink of halting the deal. The next day Zee informed the stock exchanges that the article was “baseless and factually incorrect.” It went on to add, “We wish to reiterate that the company is committed to the merger with Sony and is continuing to work towards a successful closure of the proposed merger.” Sony did not make any official statement to the exchanges.
People close to Sony said the multinational has offered Goenka the role of advisor at the new company, but said he should not be on the board, pending regulatory investigations.
Sony has been rooting for NP Singh, its India MD and CEO, as chief executive of the new entity in the interim, unless Goenka is exonerated in all pending cases.
Sony is not keen on any hostile takeover attempt , said people familiar with the group’s thinking, but it’s frustrated at the numerous delays and regulatory hurdles. Zee still has a market share of 18% in the India entertainment and broadcasting business, compared with Sony’s 6%.
The deal hit a hurdle after the Securities and Exchange Board (Sebi) banned Goenka and his father Subhash Chandra in August from the board of any listed company for a year, for allegedly diverting funds from Zee and the group’s other listed entities to founding shareholders. The Sebi order was overturned by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in October 2023.
The merger aims to create a 74-channel powerhouse that will give the Japanese group sizeable market share at a time when consolidation is transforming the media landscape in India.
ET was the first to report on December 25 last year that Reliance and Disney have signed a non-binding term sheet for a 51:49 alliance which they hope to conclude before the fiscal year ends.

IMAX
Corporation achieved its highest
box-office
earnings in India in 2023, generating $23.1 million from both
Hollywood
and Indian films amid increase in
admissions
and ticket pricing, said a senior executive.
Globally, IMAX achieved its second-highest earnings in a year in 2023, with $1.06 billion in box-office collections.
“2023 was our best year at the Indian box office, with collections up 68% compared to 2019,” Giovanni Dolci, global chief sales officer, IMAX Corporation, told ET.
He said the 2023 box-office collections should be compared with the 2019 numbers since 2020, 2021 and 2022 were abnormal years for the exhibition industry owing to the Covid-19 pandemic-related disruptions.
IMAX’s box-office collections for Indian titles amounted to $6.46 million out of a total of $23.1 million, he said, adding that the company helped Indian films collect $15.74 million in global box-office receipts.

In 2023, Oppenheimer, Avatar: The Way of Water, Jawan, Pathaan and Mission Impossible 7: Dear Reckoning Part 1 were the top five grossing films for IMAX in India, with collections of $6.1 million, $1.8 million, $1.6 million, $1.5 million and $1.2 million respectively.
Oppenheimer and Avatar: The Way of Water became the highest-grossing films in India so far for IMAX. Among the Indian films, K.G.F. Chapter 2 continues to be the top grosser, with collections of $1.7 million, followed by Jawan ($1.6 million) and Pathaan ($1.5 million) respectively.
IMAX sees huge potential in India, the company's eighth-largest growth market in terms of box-office receipts. “We intend to continue on this growth path, and we see 2024 as another key year to enable this growth,” said Dolci.
In 2023, IMAX expanded its network by launching six screens and is awaiting licence approvals to install an additional nine screens. “We increased our network by over 42% in just one year and that shows the appetite that the company has for India,” he said.
IMAX has set a target of launching 100 screens in India by 2025, up from 27 at present, and plans to expand IMAX screens in emerging cities, provided the locations are suitable.
Dolci said IMAX is not just strengthening alliances with major cinema chains such as PVR Inox and Cinepolis but is also in discussions with other exhibitors interested in investing in IMAX technology.
The company also plans to increase content throughput by collaborating with local producers, filmmakers and distributors to release more Indian titles on the IMAX platform, he said.
“We released eight Indian films across languages last year; our objective is to release more than eight in 2024,” Dolci said.
The company's slate includes 30 international and Indian films in 2024. IMAX has two Indian films scheduled for release in January, including the Hrithik Roshan film Fighter, which will be released on January 25, and the Tamil action-adventure Captain Miller, which was released on January 12.

Viacom18, which will continue to stream IPL for free on
JioCinema
, has kept its advertising rates unchanged to widen its advertiser base. The company had reportedly roped in over 500 advertisers for IPL 2023.
Viacom18 is seeking a cost per mille (CPM) rate of Rs 200 for a 10-second run-of-site (ROS) midroll and preroll mobile video ad. The free commercial time (FCT) ad rate for live matches on mobile is Rs 16 lakh for 10 seconds. For connected TV (CTV), the 10-second ad rate for a live match is Rs 6.5 lakh.
The broadcaster is seeking outlays of Rs 40 crore and Rs 30.5 crore for features like Super 4s and Super 6s.
Disney Star and Viacom18 suffered losses in IPL 2023 due to a subdued ad market, with estimated combined ad revenues of Rs 4000 crore, significantly lower than the average annual media rights fee payout of more than Rs 9500 crore for both TV and digital rights.
The two companies have collectively paid Rs 48,390 crore for the five-year media rights until 2027. Viacom18 paid Rs 23,758 crore for the IPL digital rights, while Disney Star had forked out Rs 23,575 crore for the TV rights.
IPG Mediabrands India CEO Shashi Sinha expressed hope that the overall ad expenditure on IPL will increase, given that viewership on both TV and digital has grown exponentially.
""I hope that the overall ad spend on IPL will grow. The IPL this year will clash with Lok Sabha elections. A sizeable chunk of the ad spend will also move towards news platforms,"" he noted.
Madison Media Alpha CEO Vishal Chinchankar said the IPL should see growth in overall ad spending since a lot of fresh budgets will be allocated toward the property. ""The viewership growth last year will also give clients the confidence to invest in IPL,"" he added.

Advertisement spending on connected TV seen at $500 mn by 2027,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/advertisement-spending-on-connected-tv-seen-at-500-mn-by-2027/articleshow/106843260.cms,15-01-2024,"Advertisement spending
on connected TV (CTV) is projected to touch $500 million by 2027 as the consumption of streaming content increases due to the affordability of internet-enabled TV sets and wired broadband subscriptions, a senior industry executive has said. ""Ad spend on
CTV
is likely to grow at a rapid pace to touch $500 million by 2027,"" said
Siddharth Dabhade
, South Asia managing director of global marketing intelligence firm
MiQ
.
Previously,
GroupM
had projected that the CTV ad spend would be $395 million by 2027. However, Dabhade believes ad spending will shift significantly towards CTV once it reaches the 200-million viewer threshold.
According to market estimates, CTV households in India stand between 25 million and 35 million, translating to 80-110 million viewers. By 2027, it is expected to double to 60-70 million households with 200-250 million viewers. ""The affordability of internet-enabled TVs and broadband will drive growth in the CTV universe,"" he said, adding the top six metros account for a sizable portion of the CTV base, with the base expanding rapidly in tier-1 and -2 cities.
Dabhade added the rapid increase in rural affordability and infrastructure development will determine CTV's future growth. ""The demand for streaming content on TV is increasing even as content consumption on mobile devices is growing,"" he noted.
Meanwhile, a survey by MiQ revealed that 56% of Indian consumers use a second screen while streaming videos or TV content, and 72% prioritise pricing over content. The survey was conducted among 1,200 consumers and brand marketers in India, said Dabhade.

The study shows 37% of Indian consumers would consider cheaper ad-supported streaming services and 82% of viewers engage with ads during TV programming, making India one of the highest globally.
Furthermore, 59% of the Indian businesses anticipate an increase in CTV marketing spending within the next 12-24 months, with 74% of advertisers evaluating campaign success based on reach/frequency.
MiQ has access to data on over 765 billion impressions/commercials annually and over 140,000 TV viewership signals per household, resulting in 6.4 trillion TV content consumption signals.
Dabhade noted that CTV combines the engagement of traditional TV with the targeting capabilities of digital. ""CTV is a new platform, so many advertisers are still learning how to use it effectively,"" Dabhade said.

Entertainment Enterprises to merge their businesses in India, the Nikkei reported on Wednesday, citing people involved in the negotiations, after media reports earlier said the Japanese company was planning to scrap the $10 billion deal.
The talks will continue until a Jan. 20 deadline to close the deal, the Nikkei reported.
Bloomberg News reported on Monday that Sony planned to file a termination notice before the deadline over an impasse on whether Zee CEO
Punit Goenka
, who is facing a regulatory probe, will lead the merged company.
Zee said reports of the deal falling through were ""baseless and factually incorrect"", and that it continued to work towards closing the deal.
Shares of Zee rose as much as 4.5% after the Nikkei report on Wednesday.

They had closed about 8% lower on Tuesday in its worst session since April 2021 on concerns about what a
merger
collapse would mean for the cash-strapped Indian broadcaster in a highly competitive market.
Analysts say the deal is crucial to the companies' survival amid the looming merger of local heavyweight Reliance Industries and Walt Disney's Indian media and entertainment businesses.
Sony India did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The merger, announced in 2021, was delayed after India's markets regulator last year barred Goenka from directorships of any listed company over allegations that he was involved in diverting company funds, although a tribunal lifted the ban in October.

Sony-Zee merger talks: Sony had turned down Punit Goenka's proposal for replacement of CEO,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-zee-merger-talks-sony-had-turned-down-punit-goenkas-proposal-for-replacement-of-ceo/articleshow/106676809.cms,10-01-2024,"Mumbai:
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
managing director and CEO
Punit Goenka
had proposed a solution to end the deadlock in the
Sony-Zee merger
talks - by offering to replace himself as CEO soon after taking charge of the
merged entity
, two people with knowledge of the matter said. But
Sony
scuttled the idea, insisting on
NP Singh
as its candidate for the corner room, they said.
""Goenka had proposed to Sony that he was open to an independent search process to find a new CEO to replace him after he takes over,"" one of the individuals cited above told ET. ""He was even willing to offer guarantees. However, Sony favoured NP Singh as the CEO for the Zee-Sony merged entity.""
The person said Goenka's concern was that ""as the CEO of Zee, he should feel comfortable with the leadership of the merged entity, which he clearly wasn't with Sony's choice"".
Earlier, Sony had opposed the idea of Goenka taking over as the managing director and CEO of the merged entity, citing stock market regulator Sebi's probe against him and his father Subhash Chandra for alleged fund diversion from Zee to promoter group companies.
As part of the scheme of arrangement signed in December 2021, Goenka was to be the MD and CEO of the merged entity for five years ""subject to and on the terms as agreed between Punit Goenka and Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI)"".

On December 20, Sony agreed to extend the deadline by a month to make the merger scheme with Zee effective. The one-month good-faith negotiations between the two companies - agreed upon on December 20 - will end on January 21.
The main hurdle to the completion of the merger is the tussle between Goenka and Sony Pictures Entertainment's top brass over who will become the CEO of the merged entity, the people said.
While Sony is batting for its long-time media executive Singh, Goenka believes that the Securities Appellate Tribunal's (SAT) verdict setting aside the Sebi orders banning him from holding the top executive position has cleared the way for him to become the MD and CEO of the Sony-Zee combined entity.
Another person aware of the negotiations said Sony had offered Goenka an advisory role and a board seat. ""Sony is not averse to increasing the Rs 1,100 crore non-compete fee that they will pay the Goenkas,"" the person added.
Sony and Zee refused to comment.

Zee said to miss $200 million cricket fee deadline to Disney due to 'cash crunch',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-said-to-miss-200-million-cricket-fee-deadline-to-disney-due-to-cash-crunch/articleshow/106665794.cms,10-01-2024,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
has missed a deadline to pay $200 million to
Walt Disney
Co.’s
India
unit for TV rights of cricket matches, according to people familiar with the matter, as the firm tries to preserve cash ahead of a likely collapse of its mega merger with
Sony Group
Corp.
The Mumbai-based media firm didn’t pay the installment due early January citing a cash crunch, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public.
Disney
has sought explanation from Zee on why the payment was skipped, they said, adding the tranche was part of the over $1.4 billion Zee agreed to pay for the license agreement signed in August 2022.
Defaulting on the payment to Disney unit poses fresh headaches for Zee, including possible legal wrangles, even as it deals with the fallout of a collapsing merger with the Sony Group. Zee hasn’t furnished bank guarantees for the sum that was to be paid as per the contract, according to one of the persons familiar.
Spokespersons for Zee and Disney didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Bloomberg News reported Monday that Sony was planning to send a deal termination notice to Zee, which said Tuesday that it was still working toward closing the merger.

Spectators react as they watch the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 final match between India and Australia, on a digital device at a store in Old Delhi, India, on Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023. Disney Star had entered a pact with Zee in August 2022 to license exclusive TV rights for International Cricket Council men’s matches in India till 2027, while Disney’s streaming platform in the country retained digital rights for the property, according to an exchange filing then.
The Indian entertainment company was betting on the TV rights to retain its viewership and attract more advertisers in the cricket-crazy nation of more than 1.4 billion people.
Zee’s shares plunged as much as 14% on Tuesday before paring losses. It was trading 7.7% lower in Mumbai at 2:35 pm while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex had advanced.

Zee Ent dismisses reports of Zee-Sony merger termination,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-ent-dismisses-reports-of-zee-sony-merger-termination/articleshow/106661390.cms,09-01-2024,"Zee Entertainment
on Tuesday dismissed media reports claiming termination of the $10 billion merger with
Sony Pictures
' India arm in a stock exchange filing.
The Puneet Goenka-led company said the report is baseless and factually incorrect.
""We wish to reiterate that the Company is committed to the merger with
Sony
and is continuing
to work towards a successful closure of the proposed merger,"" the company said.
Shares of Zee Entertainment which was down 8 per cent at open, pared some losses to trade down 4.80 per cent following the clarification as of 1:20 pm.
Live Events
ET on January 9 reported that Sony Group Corp is on the verge of calling off its proposed $10 billion merger between its India operations with
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL).
The said merger was first announced two years ago in a bid to create India’s largest broadcast company.
Sony-Zee merger: What could spoil creation of $10 billion media giant?
Sony and Zee's merger discussions have been ongoing for two years, but there has been no progress. This has caused concern for nearly 400,000 shareholders of Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The stock on Tuesday crashed 14% after reports suggested Sony Group is close to calling off the proposed $10 billion merger between its India operations with Zee Entertainment Enterprises. However, Zee dismissed these rumours as ""baseless"" and affirmed its commitment to the merger with Sony.
The lapses in complying with what are called conditions precedents (CP) in legalese, has added to the simmering discontentment between the suitors, who thus far couldn’t agree on ZEEL MD Punit Goenka being the CEO of the merged entity, until he’s cleared of charges that he siphoned off money from the publicly-traded firm to closely held companies owned by his family’s Essel Group.

Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in June alleged that Goenka and Zee Group Chairman Subhash Chandra were involved in diverting company funds. However, in October, the Securities Appellate Tribunal lifted the ban on Goenka which stopped him from holding board positions in Zee Group companies.
The Goenka family owns 3.99% equity in ZEEL.

The combined entity was to own over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV) and two film studios (Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India), making it the largest entertainment network in India. In December of that year, the companies signed a definitive agreement for their merger.

is close to calling off its proposed $10 billion
merger
between its India operations with
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL) – first announced two years ago in a bid to create India’s largest
broadcast company
— owing to what it sees as the inability of the latter to fulfil several conditions laid down in the
merger agreement
, two people aware of the development said.
The lapses in complying with what are called conditions precedents (CP) in legalese, has added to the simmering discontentment between the suitors, who thus far couldn’t agree on ZEEL MD Punit Goenka being the CEO of the merged entity, until he’s cleared of charges that he siphoned off money from the publicly-traded firm to closely held companies owned by his family’s Essel Group. The Goenka family owns 3.99% equity in ZEEL.
Sony
is planning to officially send a
termination notice
to
Zee
by this month end, maybe as early as January 22nd, said two people aware of the matter, unless Zee relents on key clauses. Sources close to Zee said most operational CPs have been ""cured"" while some joint ones are pending from both sides and those linked to the actual consummation of the merger will happen on deal closure.
Sony-Zee merger: What could spoil creation of $10 billion media giant?
Sony and Zee's merger discussions have been ongoing for two years, but there has been no progress. This has caused concern for nearly 400,000 shareholders of Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The stock on Tuesday crashed 14% after reports suggested Sony Group is close to calling off the proposed $10 billion merger between its India operations with Zee Entertainment Enterprises. However, Zee dismissed these rumours as ""baseless"" and affirmed its commitment to the merger with Sony.
However discussions are still ongoing between two sides and their lawyers — Trilegal for Zee and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas for Sony — to find a breakthrough which some are still hopeful of. These meetings kickstarted ever since on December 20th Zee informed the stock exchanges that it is entering into a good faith agreement with Sony – a contractual provision under the Merger Cooperation Agreement (MCA) signed between both parties in December 2021 — to discuss the extension of the date required to make the merger scheme effective by a reasonable period.
As per the Clause 8.25 of the MCA, the “good faith” clause gets triggered only if the merger scheme is ineffective within a stipulated period previously agreed upon. “It is clarified that there shall be no limitation on the number of times that parties shall be permitted to mutually extend the extended end date (as applicable). If (A) the parties are unable to mutually agree to an extended End Date within a period of 30 days from the last effective End Date (which for the sake of clarity may include an extended End Date or (B) the Scheme and all transaction Documents have not become effective in accordance with its terms within the extended End Date mutually agreed by the parties under this Clause 8.25, any party may terminate this agreement, by giving written notice to each of the other Parties.”
Live Events
Even though the good faith timelines can get extended, sources at Sony Global suggest repeated extensions may not be viable given the poor state of financials of Zee which gives them the right to walk away from the previous terms of engagement. This triggers a “material adverse effects” clause. The merger agreement had a band below which the company financials could not go. Since the merger was announced, Zee’s EBITDA (operating profit) has come down to Rs 1107 crore in March 2023 from Rs 1606 in March 2021 but net profit has plummeted to Rs 48 crore from Rs 793 crore in the same period. In March 2022, profits were at Rs 956 crore. “This bridge is impossible to fix,” according to an official. Sources close to Zee said the entire industry including Zee has been hit and ZEEL poor financial performance does not trigger any material adverse impact.
Zee declined to comment. Sony Global's spokesperson did not respond to ET’s detailed questionnaire.
Anger over appointment
At Sony’s headquarters in Los Angeles senior leaders like Eric Moreno, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development & M&A, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Ravi Ahuja, Chairman, Global TV Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment Corporate Development, have been flummoxed and frustrated that even after two years, the deal is not closing despite receiving all key approvals, including that of the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal, stock exchanges and shareholders.
From Zee’s end, the appointment of Punit Goenka as the MD and CEO of the has become a key issue to stall the merger, thus far. Goenka wants Sony to honour the original terms of the merger scheme wherein he was to serve as MD and CEO of Sony-Zee for a period of five years from the effective date, subject to terms and conditions.
However with Sebi slapping bans on Goenka and his father Subhas Chandra from holding key posts in listed companies in August 2023, Sony has not been keen on him heading the merged entity. Instead it recommended its India MD and CEO NP Singh as CEO of the new entity, in the interim unless Goenka exonerates from all pending cases, ET has reported. Goenka though has been emboldened after he was reinstated as the managing director and chief executive of Zee Entertainment on October 30th after the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) overturned a ban imposed by the market regulator for allegedly siphoning off company funds.
Sony, said people in the know on conditions of anonymity as the discussions are still in private domain wants Goenka to voluntarily step down, but stay on in an advisory or as a director with an advisory fee for a certain period. One of the sources mentioned above even said, some months back, Goenka even agreed verbally to step down but did not put it in writing. Sources close to Zee said these are speculations and add that Goenka has only been insisting on the implementation of the original composite scheme in toto, else fresh shareholder approvals be taken.
The Goenka family owns only 3.99% of the company yet remain the promoters. Institutional and pubic shareholding in the company is 96.01% as of September 2023. If the merger came through Sony would have owned 50.86% stake in the merged company. Even though the Goenka family’s stake would have remained the same, there was a claw back clause that would have helped them ratchet up their shareholding over time.
“There is now a massive trust deficit and over time the divergence has only widened,” said a person who did not wish to be identified.
CPs outstanding
Common in wills, trusts or any M&A documents, CPs are a legal term that defines certain conditions that must either occur or be met by either party to ensure progress or execution of a contract. Sources close to Sony said most of the important CPs to be fulfilled by Zee are still outstanding. Even the “standstill agreements” have been breached. Once a merger is announced both parties involved agree on a standstill agreement meaning, they will keep each other in the know regarding strategic decisions.
A number of actions by Zee subsequent to the signing of the merger agreement have now emerged as irritants in the eyes of its suitor.
As per the original terms of the merger, beyond a certain value, Zee management had to seek Sony’s permission to buy any content or assets and vice versa. But in August 2022, Goenka agreed to sub-licensed the linear television rights from Disney Star of the International Cricket Council (ICC) men’s events for the next cycle. Zee Entertainment’s agreement, for approximately $1.5 billion, in a first-of-its-kind alliance between rival broadcasters sharing the media rights of the matches. Sony HQ was initially not kept in the loop. To be fair, the CCI approval had not come in by then, so according to lawyers, Zee could not have informed Sony else it would seem that both were acting in concert. However, Sony construes this as a violation of the standstill agreement, if not an explicit CP breach. Sony eventually relented with one condition — any losses accrued will have to be absorbed by Zee upfront and not added to the liability of the new merged entity such that it does not impact their shareholder value. ET on December 28 reported that Zee and Disney’s deal is yet to get consummated as Zee has not given the required bank guarantees to Disney Star. The matter is likely to go legal. Sources close to Zee said, in the FY23 annual report the company, Zee has said that the acquisition of ICC TV rights is subject to certain CPs that are still pending.
There are certain non-core real estate assets in which certain ZEEL operations are housed that needed to be divested due to regulatory overhang. The matter is still outstanding.
Zee has subsidiaries in Russia – Zee CIS Holdings (wholly owned) and Zee CIS LLC (49% held directly; 51% indirectly). Sony, being an American entity, could not do business with entities with links to Moscow and had requested Zee to divest or close or spin off these arms. It hasn’t happened till date. Sources close to Zee said, operations in Russia, Germany and even Thailand, though profitable, have been closed. Zee opened a channel in Africa, in violation of standstill agreement.
Zee invested Rs 522 crore in a content company called Margo in April 2020 a year before the Sony merger announcement. Margo entered into a contract with Indian Railways for content streaming, but the contract was cancelled, and Margo moved court. Sony wanted the investment to be hived off and not be included in the merged co as part of the CP. In its 2022 annual report, ZEE Entertainment said, “The Management as part of its portfolio rationalisation initiative and conditions of impending merger; is in the process of either liquidating/ discontinuing/ selling certain entities (primarily Margo Networks Private Limited). Basis the same, the Management has classified the investment in relation to these entities as Non-current Assets held for sale/disposal under IND AS 105 (‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’). Considering these assets are held for sale, the assets have been recorded at their realisable value. Accordingly, the company recorded an impairment of Rs 3,313 million (Rs 331 crore) on such assets which has been disclosed as an exceptional item. However, sources close to Sony say the matter is still not closed.
Boardroom backlash
Just days before the merger was to close in December, two independent directors of ZEEL Vivek Mehra and Sasha Mirchandani’s reappointment proposals were defeated after they failed to get approval from 75% of shareholders. Another Adesh Kumar Gupta, retired by rotation, so the resolution proposing his reappointment became infructuous during the 41st AGM. Deepu Bansal, a Chartered Accountant and Senior Partner in NDB & Associates LLP, Chartered Accountants was appointed as an independent director.
Three new independent directors, Venkata Ramana Murthy Pinisetti, Shishir Babubhai Desai and Uttam Prakash Agarwal were appointed as independent directors with effect from 17 December 2023. However, barring Bansal, the other three need to be voted in by the shareholders. The matter is still outstanding.
“Sony is singed and Zee is hanging by the skin of the teeth,” said an official in the know.

Group Corp. is planning to call off the
merger
pact of its India unit with
Zee
Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., said people familiar with the matter, capping two years of drama and delay in creating a $10 billion media giant.
The Japanese conglomerate is looking to cancel the deal due to a standoff over whether Zee’s Chief Executive Officer Punit Goenka, also its founder’s son, would lead the merged entity, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. While the agreement signed in 2021 was that Goenka would lead the new company, Sony no longer wants him as CEO amid a regulatory probe, the people said.
Sony plans to file the termination notice before a Jan. 20 extended deadline for closing the deal, saying some of the conditions necessary for the merger had not been met, one of the people said. Goenka has stood his ground in wanting to helm the merged entity, as agreed initially, over prolonged meetings in the past few weeks, according to another person.
Discussions are still ongoing between the two sides and a resolution can still emerge before the deadline.
Representatives for Sony and Zee did not immediately respond to an email and phone calls seeking comment.
Live Events
Last-Mile Tussle
The scuttling of the deal due to the last-lap leadership tussle will not only leave Zee vulnerable to possible defaults, it’s coming at a time when billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
is seeking to bolster Reliance Industries Ltd.’s media ambitions by negotiating a merger with Walt Disney Co.’s India unit.
The Sony-Zee combine aimed to create a $10 billion media behemoth with the financial muscle to take on global powerhouses Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as well as local heavyweights like Reliance.
Mumbai-based Zee had earlier requested for an extension of a Dec. 21 deadline by a month. Sony said then that it wanted to hear Zee’s proposals on completing the “remaining critical closing conditions.”
The Securities and Exchange Board of India alleged in June that Zee faked the recovery of loans to cover private financing deals by its founder, Subhash Chandra. Chandra and his son, Goenka, “abused their position” and siphoned off funds, SEBI said in an interim order, barring Goenka from executive or director appointments in listed companies.
While Goenka got a reprieve from an appellate authority against the Sebi order, Sony views the ongoing probe as a corporate governance issue, Bloomberg reported earlier.
Sony Pictures Networks India Pvt. would have owned a 50.86% stake in the merged media firm and Goenka’s family was to own 3.99% in the proposed transaction, according to the 2021 agreement. The proposed merger has received almost all regulatory approvals and would have helped expand Sony’s media business in the world’s most-populous country.

ET Online has not verified the report independently.
Despite the pact between the two companies being signed in 2021 and all requisite regulatory approvals in place, the merger struggled to through successfully before its deadline because of a host of issues.
In December, Zee said it had sought further extension of a merger deadline, beyond December 21, from the Indian arm (Culver Max Entertainment) of Japan-based Sony Group to make the scheme effective.

Among the other legal issues has been the inability of the two companies to decide who the leader of the merged entity would be. News agency Reuters reported that Sony was pushing for its Indian operations managing director NP Singh to be the top executive, while Zee was pushing for Punit Goenka.
Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in June alleged that Goenka and Zee Group Chairman Subhash Chandra were involved in diverting company funds. However, in October, the Securities Appellate Tribunal lifted the ban on Goenka which stopped him from holding board positions in Zee Group companies.
Culver Max Entertainment (then named Sony Pictures Networks India) and ZEEL announced that the two companies entered into a non-binding term sheet to bring together their linear networks, digital assets, production operations and programme libraries.
The combined entity was to own over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV) and two film studios (Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India), making it the largest entertainment network in India. In December of that year, the companies signed a definitive agreement for their merger.

Broadcasters hike prices of channel bouquets on rising content expenses,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/broadcasters-hike-prices-of-channel-bouquets-on-rising-content-expenses/articleshow/106583196.cms,06-01-2024,"Broadcasters
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
, Sony Pictures Networks India, and Viacom18 have raised TV channel
bouquet prices
to offset rising
content expenses
that will affect
monthly TV
bills for consumers.
Network18 and Viacom18's distribution arm IndiaCast has raised the price of their bouquets by 20-25% after adding big-ticket sports properties to their portfolio.
Zee hiked the price of its bouquets by over 9–10%, while Sony's bouquet prices have gone up by 10–11%. Disney Star is yet to unveil its new bouquet pricing.
While the broadcasters said the new pricing will come into effect on February 1, regulation states that they can implement the new pricing 30 days after the publication of the reference interconnect offer (RIO).
However, with 2024 being an election year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is carefully monitoring broadcaster rate cards to avert customer outrage.
TRAI sources indicate the regulator will scrutinize broadcaster bouquets to ensure compliance with the new tariff order (NTO) 3.0.

Broadcasters
have increased their prices for the second time following the implementation of NTO 3.0 by the TRAI in November 2022. The TV channel prices were frozen for nearly three years before February 2023 due to an impasse over the implementation of NTO 2.0.
The price hike in February 2023 followed a dispute between broadcasters and cable TV companies, resulting in broadcasters switching off TV signals to cable TV operators.
Broadcasters are required to declare both a la carte and bouquet prices for their channels, but most consumers prefer bouquets for cost efficiency.
Industry executives point out that Viacom18's aggressive price hike stems from its investment of upwards of Rs 34,000 crore in sports rights, which include Indian Premier League (IPL) digital rights, BCCI media rights, Cricket South Africa media rights, and the Olympics 2024.
""Viacom18 is targeting strong double-digit growth in subscription revenue due to the addition of BCCI. Sony and Zee have settled for an inflation-linked hike,"" said a top-level executive with a leading broadcasting firm.
According to a source aware of the development, Disney Star is contemplating its pricing strategy after it lost the BCCI media rights and the uncertainty over the fate of the International Cricket Council (ICC) TV rights deal.
Disney Star acquired ICC media rights for $3 billion and sublicensed the TV rights to Zee while retaining the digital rights. Zee is yet to fulfill its part of the commitments to Disney Star, which is holding up the sub-licensing deal.
""Zee's bouquet pricing doesn't seem to factor in the ICC TV rights. It will be interesting to see Disney Star's new pricing since they have lost BCCI rights and ICC TV rights is now their responsibility,"" said a veteran TV distribution executive.
Industry watchers said the increase at the consumer level will be in the single digits as broadcasters and TV distribution platforms will negotiate soon to reduce the burden on consumers.
They also point out that the price hike will potentially increase consumer churn. In the April-June quarter, four pay DTH service providers increased their customer base by 250,000, reversing a declining subscriber trend. Cable TV platforms are experiencing a monthly customer churn of 2%.
""We have been absorbing price hikes from big broadcasters by reducing the bouquet size. Small broadcasters are getting squeezed out as distributors have no option but to absorb the rate hikes by the big four broadcasters,"" said a senior official with a cable TV company.
Despite the subscriber churn, the broadcasters have hiked prices as their subscription revenue has either remained flat or is growing in single digits.
""The idea is to protect the subscription revenue by growing the average revenue per user,"" a senior TV executive pointed out.
In FY23, Disney Star's standalone subscription revenue stood at Rs 4949 crore. Network18/Viacom18 posted subscription revenue of Rs 1,925 crore. Sony and Zee recorded subscription revenues of Rs 3134 crore and Rs 2818 crore, respectively.

"2023, a blockbuster year for film industry",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/2023-a-blockbuster-year-for-film-industry/articleshow/106388515.cms,30-12-2023,"Mumbai: 2023 has been a golden year for the
Indian film industry
, in general and for
Bollywood
in particular, with four
Hindi films
crossing Rs 500 crore each in box office earnings and the gross box office collections projected to touch a new high of Rs 12,000 crore.
Bollywood's resurgence has been driven by diverse content offerings, innovative marketing, and pent-up demand among audiences for experiencing movies on the big screen notwithstanding the rise of
streaming platforms
, industry executives and experts said.
While star-studded films like Gadar 2, Pathaan and Animal did send the cash registers ringing,
mid-budget films
such as 12th Fail and Sam Bahadur have performed reasonably well.
After a challenging 2022, Bollywood delivered four films — Gadar 2, Pathaan, Jawan, and Animal — with box office earnings of over Rs 500 crore. In 2022, the gross box-office collection of Rs 10,637 crore was driven largely by
South Indian films
KGF: Chapter 2, RRR and Kantara, according to a report of consultancy firm GroupM-Ormax Media. The report said that the box collections of Bollywood films had declined 27% from 2019 to Rs 3,513 crore in 2022.
In 2023, industry executives project the box office collections of Bollywood films to touch Rs 5,000 crore.
Live Events
ET Bureau
PVR Inox executive director Sanjeev Kumar Bijli said Bollywood's growth in 2023 was driven by both blockbusters and mid-scale movies.
""Despite featuring renowned stars with massive fan followings, the success of these movies can be attributed to the resonating content that particularly struck a chord with the young audience,"" he added.
Bijli said the Indian film industry's box office collection is expected to reach an all-time high of Rs 12,000 crore, driven in part by the strong performances of films like Animal, Salaar and Dunki towards the end of the year.
Cinepolis India chief executive Devang Sampat said the overall box office collections grew by 10–15%, driven equally by Hindi and regional cinema.
""The rekindled audience interest in theatrical experiences can be partly attributed to a burgeoning sense of ‘OTT fatigue’, prompting moviegoers to seek the communal and emotionally rich experiences afforded by the big screen,"" he added.
While concurring with Sampat's take on OTT fatigue, director Nikkhil Advani said that there is a “post-Covid buoyancy” from audiences that has reflected in a return to cinemas and a waning interest in OTT content.
Larger-than-life movies
Screenwriter Anjum Rajabali feels the obvious conclusion is that spectacle, action and larger-than-life movies have a visceral reaction. ""That habit of collective viewing of fans stands strong — you love going to the cinema because there is a seamless, exclusive relationship with your star,"" Rajabali said.
Yash Raj Films' Pathaan and Tiger 3, which together collected close to Rs 1,500 crore, fall in the larger-than-life category.
Akshaye Widhani, who is the YRF CEO, noted that 2023 has been one of the best years in the company’s five-decade-old history due to the performances of the two movies.
""As an industry, this year we have seen great content reap huge rewards, whether it is Gadar 2, Jawan, or now Animal. The entertainment industry rule book has changed,"" Widhani said.
Advani, who produced the hit Rani Mukerji-starrer Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway, said star power certainly has a key role to play in the success of films.
“It’s the stars we’ve grown up watching — Shah Rukh Khan, Sunny Deol and Rani — that still have that aura. You can’t deny the ingredients of a mass entertainer like Animal too,"" he added.
According to Zee Studios CEO Shariq Patel, big stars telling entertaining and emotional stories compelled audiences to throng the theatres in large numbers. He termed it a revenge-viewing phenomenon.
""The foundation of a good movie is a strong emotional story with stardom laced on top of it to deliver the knockout punch,"" he said.
Zee Studios' Gadar 2 grossed close to Rs 700 crore in global box office collections.
Viacom18 Studios chief operating officer Ajit Andhare said the box office resurgence in 2023 was driven by compelling narratives and star power woven into conversations resonating deeply with the audience.
Viacom18 Studios delivered multiple blockbuster films during the year, including Drishyam 2, MI7, Rocky aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani and OMG2, he said. It is gearing up to the release Hrithik Roshan starrer Fighter, which is touted as the first-of-its-kind aerial action film.
Smaller films like 12th Fail and Sam Bahadur were the ones that worked on content and stellar performances. “There’s an earnestness that is missing in today’s cynical world and that connects to us,” said Rajabali.

Uncertainty looms over $1.5 billion ICC TV rights deal between Disney and Zee,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/uncertainty-looms-over-1-5-billion-icc-tv-rights-deal-between-disney-and-zee/articleshow/106333734.cms,28-12-2023,"Mumbai: The $1.5 billion International Cricket Council (
ICC
) TV rights deal between
Disney Star
and
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
hangs in the balance with the new
media rights cycle
set to kick off next month.
A source aware of the development said the ICC TV deal, which was announced in August 2022, is yet to be concluded as
Zee
has not given the required bank guarantees to Disney Star.
In its FY23 annual report, Zee has said that the acquisition of ICC TV rights is ""subject to certain conditions precedent, including submitting financial commitments, guarantees, and ICC approval for sub-licensing to the firm, which are pending"".
The uncertain status of the ICC TV deal will be a key point of consideration during the due diligence and valuation exercises between Walt Disney and Reliance Industries (RIL) regarding the potential merger of
Star India
and
Viacom18
.
The ICC Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup 2024, which will be held in South Africa from January 19 to February 11, will be the first tournament under the new media rights cycle. Disney Star acquired the ICC TV and digital rights for India from 2024 to 2027 for $3 billion and sub-licensed the TV rights for the men's and Under-19 global events to Zee while retaining the digital rights.

Interestingly, Disney Star's winning bid of $3 billion was more than double that of
Sony Pictures Networks
India (SPNI) and Viacom18. The two firms are believed to have offered $1.3-1.4 billion for the ICC's TV and digital rights. Both Disney Star and Zee declined to comment on the matter.
If the ICC TV rights do not materialise, Disney Star, which signed the contract with the ICC, will have to service the entire $3 billion sports rights obligation over the next four years.
Analysts tracking the media sector say that Disney Star's valuation is likely to drop due to the expected losses from sports. Between ICC media rights and Indian Premier League (IPL) TV rights, Disney Star has committed $6 billion, and recovering those investments will be an uphill task. ET had reported in its December 25 edition that Disney Star's parent Walt Disney has recently signed a non-binding agreement with RIL to merge Star India and Viacom18.
On the other hand, if Zee fails to honour its ICC TV sub-licensing deal with Disney Star, the latter might also explore legal options. ""Disney Star would not hesitate to take Zee to court if it fails to honour the agreement,"" a legal expert said.
'Profitability Under Stress'
According to a top media executive, Zee is also in a bind as its priority currently is to salvage the merger deal with Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI).
""Without the merger with Sony, Zee will find it difficult to service the $1.5 billion ICC TV deal, as its profitability is already under stress,"" said the executive cited above. He further noted that Zee had acquired the ICC TV rights from Disney Star with the expectation that its merger with Sony would sail through and the latter would invest $1.5 billion in growth capital in the merged company.
Zee's net profit in the first half of FY24 shrank 67% to Rs 141 crore as revenue remained under pressure from macroeconomic headwinds and costs continued to balloon due to content and marketing investments in TV and digital.
Disney Star's sports division saw operating losses widen 82% to $432 million for the 12 months ended September, while revenue fell by 39% to $729 million.
""Sports broadcasting has always been a perennial loss-maker in India, even though it is important to have sports in your portfolio since it drives subscription revenue and brings in large sponsorship money. In streaming, live sports help acquire millions of new users,"" said the former CEO of a leading sports network.

Amagi Media expects to turn profitable soon,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/amagi-media-expects-to-turn-profitable-soon/articleshow/106274284.cms,26-12-2023,"Media
technology
company
Amagi Media Labs
, which was last valued at $1.4 billion, is hoping to become
profitable
in the first half of 2024, the company’s co-founder said.
“We are just about a couple of months away from becoming profitable. We hope to become profitable in the first half of 2024,” Amagi Media Labs CEO and co-founder Baskar Subramanian told ET.
Amagi's
growth
rate has tapered as its
revenue
base has broadened, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) topping $100 million amidst global movement among
broadcasters
to shift from
hardware
to cloud-based distribution.
“We've been growing almost 100% a year over the last 3–4 years. At $100 million ARR, you cannot do another 100% growth. We hope to grow by 30–40% going forward,” Subramanian added.
Amagi provides end-to-end, cloud-managed video infrastructure for TV and OTT. Globally, the company works with close to 400 TV networks, including NBC Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).
Live Events
The Bengaluru-headquartered company gets 78% of its revenues from the US, followed by 15% from Europe. Currently, revenue contributions from Asia and India are in the single digits.
However, Subramanian expects that to change in the coming years as Indian broadcasters shift from hardware to cloud-based content distribution, which may help companies save up to 40% in costs on average.
“All the major television networks in India are developing cloud strategies. We are also seeing the overall concept of consumer streaming content and ad-supported models evolve. In 12 to 18 months, we foresee a lot of transformation taking place in India,” he noted.
Every year, broadcasters worldwide spend up to $50 billion on technology upgrades. In the United States, just 8% of channels are distributed through cloud-based playout, whereas the percentage in India is even less, at under 1%.
Amagi plans to take advantage of the fact that the vast majority of broadcasters have yet to adopt cloud-based playout.
In India, companies like Viacom18 and Zee Entertainment Enterprises have already started using cloud-based playouts for their international TV channels.
“Except for the cameras and the TV sets, everything in the middle can be software. That's the big opportunity for us to build that next-generation capability as we move forward,” Subramanian stated.
Having raised $300 million in funding from private equity firms in the last two years and attaining the unicorn tag, Amagi has no plans to raise funds unless the company has to make an acquisition.
“We are well capitalised and the company has money in the bank, so we don’t need the money. We are also very close to profitability as a company,” Subramanian said.
Amagi received a $100 million investment from global growth equity firm General Atlantic in November 2022, valuing the company at $1.4 billion. Before that, it secured $95 million in March 2022 from Accel, Norwest Venture Partners, and Avataar Ventures at a $1 billion valuation.
Subramanian said Amagi is open to acquisitions, provided the target company has great talent, technology, and revenue.
Recently, Amagi signed a definitive agreement to acquire Tellyo, a leading real-time live cloud remote production, clipping, editing, and social sharing platform.
Amagi employs close to 1,000 people globally, including over 400 engineers.
“Outside of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google, I believe no other firm has as significant media technology expertise in a single group as Amagi has today,"" Subramanian said.

Industries Ltd (RIL) and
Walt Disney Co
signed a non-binding
term sheet
in London last week to move ahead with plans to create India’s largest
media
and
entertainment
business, said people with knowledge of the matter. The 51:49 stock-and-cash merger in favour of the Mukesh Ambani-led group is expected to get finalised with a view to completing all commercial ratifications and regulatory approvals by February, even though RIL is keen to wrap it up by January end.
Kevin Mayer, a former
Disney
executive brought back in July by chief executive Bob Iger as an adviser to help him navigate the company’s legacy television business and the ESPN sports network and Manoj Modi, a close confidante of Ambani, were among those present in the meeting. Both have been negotiating for months now to finalise the term sheet document.
Following last week’s signing confirmatory due diligence, a valuation exercise by independent valuers will officially begin and legal and tax advisors will be brought on board. There is likely to be a 45-60 day exclusivity period that can be mutually extended.
The development comes even as the fate of the $10 billion merger between Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Sony Group Corp.’s local unit, the biggest in India media amalgamation announced till date - hangs in balance even after two years.
ET was the first to report about the proposed RIL-Disney term sheet in its December 12 edition.

A Disney India spokesperson declined to comment. Mails sent to Reliance on Saturday evening did not generate a comment till press time Sunday.
The plan, as of now, is to create a step-down subsidiary of RIL’s Viacom18, which will absorb Star India via a stock swap, said the people cited above. Reliance is pitching to be the larger shareholder with at least 51% in the merged company with Disney owning the residual 49%, they said. Both businesses are being treated as similar-sized ones, so RIL is likely to pay cash for the controlling stake. Jio Cinema, a part of Viacom 18 will also be included in the deal.
The two sides are also negotiating a business plan to inject cash as immediate capital investment, expected to be $1-1.5 billion. The final shareholding structure of the entity will get crystallised and its value established based on the cash infusion from each of the parties. In the line of fire from activist shareholder Nelson Peltz for poor succession planning, Disney appointed two new directors – Morgan Stanley CEO James Gormon and former group chief executive at Sky Sir Jeremy Darroch, late November. In the same month, Walt Disney CEO Iger said on an earnings call in November that the company was “considering options” but that it would like to stay on in India and try and “strengthen our hand, improve the bottom line”.
That statement highlighted a clear intent of staying on in India. This is Disney’s third coming in India. The first in 1993 was through an alliance with KK Modi’s Group. It went south. Then in bought into Ronnie Scewvala’s UTV but that too did not go as per script and finally in 2018 when Rupert Murdoch sold his entertainment business to Disney globally for $71.3 billion Star India was billed as the “crown jewel.”
“Therefore cashing out yet again was not a priority for Bob Iger (Disney CEO). A partnership was that would also help him deconsolidate his global balance sheet.”
The board is expected to have equal representation from Reliance and Disney of at least two directors each. Uday Shankar-led Bodhi Tree, the second largest shareholder in Viacom18 after Reliance with a 15.97% stake, is likely to get a seat. A minimum of two independent directors are being considered. This may change in the weeks ahead, said the people cited above.
Investor enthusiasm for Disney’s India business started depleting in 2022 after the company lost the online rights to stream the popular IPL tournament from 2023-2027 even as it successfully won broadcast TV rights. The streaming rights went to JioCinema — a joint venture between Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Viacom18 — following a record $6.2bn auction.
While Viacom18 shelled out Rs 23,758 crore ($2.89 billion at Rs 82/dollar exchange rate) for five years and offered free streaming in 2023, Disney Star had to shell out Rs 23,575 crore ($2.87 billion) for the same period for TV rights. This was the first time a digital bid trumped legacy linear TV rights.
Back of the envelope calculations value the Disney Star India business at $5.5-$6.5 billion.
Viacom18, which also has TV18 and Paramount as shareholders, saw its FY23 net profit slump 98% to Rs 11 crore while revenue from operations rose 10% to Rs 4,554 crore. The company's expenses increased 33% to Rs 4,586 crore. In H1 FY24, Reliance 's entertainment business primarily comprising Viacom18 reported a 97% growth in revenue at Rs 4,277 crore on the back of IPL and other sports properties. As of September 30, TV network’s share increased by 50 bps to 10.5%, driven by the performance of Sports and Movies channels. As of September 30, JioCinema was the top broadcaster-OTT app in the country with an average of 210 million Monthly Active Users as per the data from Data.ai.
Walt Disney-owned Star India's consolidated net profit for FY23 dropped 31% to Rs 1,272 crore from the previous fiscal year, according to its filing with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). Novi Digital Entertainment, the subsidiary that owns Disney+ Hotstar, has seen its net loss more than double to Rs 748 crore, while revenue rose 35% to Rs 4,341 crore. Novi is in the process of merging with its parent company, Star, which holds a 78.07% stake in it.

"Mickey Mouse set to join public domain, with a twist for all of us!",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/mickey-mouse-set-to-join-public-domain-with-a-twist-for-all-of-us/articleshow/106201914.cms,22-12-2023,"Mickey Mouse
now belongs to every little kid and every grown-up who grew up watching the character on TV. The '
ownership
' however comes with a few notable asterisks and conditions but as the clock strikes 2024, Mickey Mouse, a cornerstone of every child's dream is poised to enter the
public domain
.
This historic shift comes with notable asterisks and conditions, marking the liberation of Mickey's earliest rendition in the 1928 classic ""
Steamboat Willie
"" and heralding implications for
intellectual property rights
and
creative freedom
.
Jennifer Jenkins, a law professor at Duke's Center for the Study of Public Domain, expressed exhilaration, likening the event to symbolic significance. She emphasized the broader context of
copyright
extension, acknowledging the varied interests beyond
Disney
that contributed to the term extension.
Disney, acknowledging the impending change, assured that the essence of Mickey's association with their narratives and genuine products would persist even after the expiration of the ""Steamboat Willie"" copyright. However, this liberation is restricted to the original, non-speaking, boat-captain portrayal of Mickey from the 1928 short film.
While contemporary iterations of Mickey remain unaffected, the delineation of copyright ownership over specific traits or features remains an open debate, likely to occupy courts in the future. Disney emphasized their commitment to safeguarding their rights over modern renditions of Mickey and other copyrighted works.
Live Events
Despite the imminent public domain status of Mickey's earliest version, Disney firmly holds trademarks safeguarding Mickey as their corporate emblem. The law unequivocally prohibits deceptive use of the character to mislead consumers regarding the original creator's association, maintaining Disney's brand integrity.
""Steamboat Willie,"" directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, was a pioneering work in animation, sync sound, and visual storytelling. It introduced a more mischievous portrayal of Mickey as a boat captain, accompanied by Minnie Mouse. This landmark creation, though significant, was not the initial appearance of Mickey and Minnie, but it stands as the first released cartoon featuring the iconic duo.
Beyond Mickey's imminent entry into the public domain, other notable works like Charlie Chaplin's ""Circus,"" Virginia Woolf's ""Orlando,"" and Bertolt Brecht's ""The Threepenny Opera"" are also set to join the U.S. public domain in 2024. However, this event also sheds light on the protracted duration for U.S. works to attain public domain status, leaving numerous properties in a limbo of uncertain copyrights.
The culmination of Mickey Mouse's copyright term serves as a poignant reminder of the lengthy process for U.S. works to achieve public domain status, prompting contemplation on the enduring legacy of recognizable works and the potential loss of less celebrated properties due to murky copyright conditions.
As the U.S. inches closer to aligning with the European Union's copyright terms, the discussion on broader public ownership of creative works gains momentum. Instances like George Orwell's books, which are already public domain in their country of origin, underscore the disparities in international copyright agreements, calling for potential legislative adjustments.

Sreeram said 2023 was one of the best years for Indian content globally, with locally produced content trending in the top 10 on Prime Video worldwide for 47 of the past 52 weeks.
Prime Video is positioning itself as an entertainment hub with multiple services across streaming, aggregation and movie rental.
Prime Video Channels, the aggregation service that launched two years ago in India, has added 23 content partners who cumulatively offer about 28,000 hours of content.
Its movie rental service, Prime Video Store, claims to have the largest movie library in the country with a catalogue of about 6,000 titles.
“We have done well as an entertainment hub across streaming, aggregation and movie rental,” said Sreeram.
He also said live sports continue to be a key focus area for Prime Video and the platform continues to evaluate opportunities in live sports to assess whether they make economic sense.
“Sports remains an area of interest and we continue to evaluate opportunities in live sports like the New Zealand Cricket rights,” Sreeram said.
In December 2021, Prime Video India acquired New Zealand Cricket rights till 2026, marking its entry into live sports in India. Recently, Prime Video Australia acquired the International Cricket Council (ICC) rights for that market.
Amazon did not bid for the Indian Premier League (IPL), the ICC or the Board of Control for Cricket in India, despite speculation that it was one of the contenders for digital rights to these three properties.
The Prime Video India chief said the platform’s aggregation service Prime Video Channels has added Dream Sports-owned sports streaming platform FanCode to its offering as part of its commitment to offer variety to its customers.

"Viacom18 looks to monetise rise in viewership in Hindi, Kannada",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/viacom-looks-to-monetise-rise-in-viewership-in-hindi-kannada/articleshow/106163455.cms,21-12-2023,"Bolstered by higher prime-time
viewership
share, Reliance Industries-owned Viacom18 is aiming to grow
revenue
market share in
Hindi
and
Kannada
general entertainment categories, which generate combined ad revenues of more than ₹9,000 crore each year, said a top company executive.
As per Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) data for urban NCCS ABC audiences aged 15-50, the company's Hindi GEC
Colors
has grown its evening prime-time market share from about 20% in week 27 to 27% in week 49.
Meanwhile, Colors Kannada has lifted its viewership share from 27% in week 27 to a whopping 37.2% in week 49 to become the top Kannada GEC.
Both Colors and Colors Kannada compete with channels run by Disney Star, Zee Entertainment, Sony Pictures Networks India and Sun TV Networks.
Kevin Vaz, chief executive of Viacom18's TV business, said the company's strategy of catering to an entire family by offering a mix of fiction and non-fiction content has played a major role in growing viewership.
Live Events
Fiction shows primarily attract female audiences, while non-fiction shows like Bigg Boss cut across age and gender.
""Revenue share will grow automatically as viewership share increases. However, there is a time lag in monetising that viewership growth,"" Vaz told ET.
He said both Colors and Colors Kannada are onboarding new advertisers even as existing advertisers are boosting their spending on the two channels encouraged by viewership growth.
According to a Pitch Madison report, total TV and digital video ad spends in India stood at ₹31,000 crore and ₹10,000 crore, respectively, in 2022. Viacom18 recorded a net profit of ₹11 crore on revenue of ₹4,554 crore in FY23.
Having turned around its operations in the Hindi and Kannada markets, Vaz said the network will sharpen focus on the Marathi and Bengali markets through greater investments in producing content in these markets.
Viacom18 owns and operates Colors Marathi, Colors Bangla, and Colors Bangla Cinema channels in these two markets.
Viacom18, Vaz said, will start selling ad inventory across TV and digital screens to exploit growing content consumption on both platforms, as both Colors and JioCinema, which is the company’s video streaming platform, have huge reach.
The company sold TV and digital ad inventory together for its biggest non-fiction show, Bigg Boss 17, and has seen strong double-digit ad revenue growth from the integrated approach.
According to Vaz, Viacom18 is the only network in the country catering to all key viewership segments like male, female, youth, and kids. While Colors Hindi and regional variants are meant for the entire family, MTV, and Nickelodeon are targeted at youth and kid’s audiences, respectively.
Viacom18, he said, is working on a new movie slate for its motion picture business, Viacom18 Studios, which had three of its releases, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, OMG 2, and Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One, cross Rs 100 crore in net box office collection in 2023.

In a statement, the Sony Group Corporation-owned company said it looks forward to hearing ZEEL’s proposals and how it plans to meet the remaining key conditions.
“Zee’s notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India dated December 17 is an acknowledgement that they will not be able to meet the December 21, 2023, deadline to close the SPNI/ZEE merger,” the SPNI statement read.
It added that the ZEEL notice triggers an existing contractual provision in the deal that allows for both parties to discuss the possibility of extending the deadline.
“SPNI is required to start those conversations but has not yet agreed to a deadline extension. We look forward to hearing Zee’s proposals and how they plan to complete the remaining critical closing conditions,” the company said.
On December 17, ZEEL asked SPNI and Bangla Entertainment, which is owned by SPNI, to extend the date for concluding their merger. ZEEL disclosed this in a regulatory filing on Sunday.
The Sony-Zee merger has received all key approvals, including that of the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal and the stock exchanges.
However, differences between Sony and Zee over the proposed appointment of Goenka as the merged entity’s MD and CEO have delayed the merger.
As reported first by ET, Sony is not keen on him heading the merged entity due to the Sebi probe. Sony is pushing for the appointment of SPNI MD and CEO NP Singh as CEO of the new entity.
Goenka has said the merger scheme that was agreed between the two parties should be implemented in its original form.
“From our perspective, we are committed to ensuring that all points in the Composite Scheme of Arrangement are duly addressed,” Goenka had said during Zee’s earnings call on November 9. “We recognise the value that this merger holds, and our focus remains on unlocking this opportunity for all the shareholders.”
As per the merger scheme agreed between the two, Goenka was to serve as MD and CEO of Sony-Zee for a period of five years from the effective date, subject to terms and conditions.
Sony and Zee signed a merger agreement in December 2021. It was anticipated to conclude in eight to 10 months. In May, Sony chairman and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said the merger would conclude by September 30. That deadline was breached due to the legal cases filed by lenders against ZEEL.
If completed, the merger will lead to the creation of a multibillion-dollar media powerhouse with a leading position in TV, OTT, and content creation. FY23 financials show that ZEEL and Sony's combined revenue was almost Rs 15,000 crore.
Sony will indirectly own 50.86% of the new company, while other ZEEL shareholders will hold a 45.15% stake and the ZEEL founders would have 3.99%. The merged entity will get a fund infusion of $1.5 billion from Sony.

""NewsClick"" and its legal counsel are reviewing the developments, it said, adding that legal appeals against this ""unjust and cruel"" measure will be initiated at the earliest.
Prabir Purkayastha, the editor-in-chief and founder of the portal, and administrative officer Amit Chakraborty were arrested by the

The Delhi Police moved a court here on Tuesday seeking more time to complete its probe in the case lodged under anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) over allegations that the portal received money to spread pro-China propaganda.
""NewsClick"" gained fresh spotlight a few months ago after a ""

Diamond Sports, a move that would advance the e-commerce giant's aggressive push into
sports content
, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Diamond Sports Group, which carries the games of more than 40 major sports teams across the United States and filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, is actively negotiating with Amazon about a strategic investment and a multi-year streaming partnership, according to the report.
If an agreement is reached, Amazon's Prime Video platform would eventually become the streaming home for Diamond's games, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Diamond, which has the local rights to about half the teams in Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association and about a third of the
National Hockey League
teams, would continue operating its cable networks through its existing partnerships, according to the report.
It isn't clear how much money Amazon is planning to invest or at what valuation, and Diamond has received support from a select group of creditors for proceeding with the talks, the Wall Street Journal said.

Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara Capital, said, the negotiations between both parties could be resolved over the next 3-4 weeks, post which MIB (Ministry of Information and Broadcasting), record date, delisting/relisting process may take another 6-8 weeks.
""We therefore believe that the merged company could get listed by Mar/Apr’24,"" he said.
Sony and Zee signed a merger agreement in December 2021. The deal was anticipated to conclude in 8-10 months. However, two years down the line, it is yet to be completed due to the cases filed by financial institutions against ZEEL and the Sebi order against the company’s promoters.
Once completed, the merger will lead to the creation of a $10 billion media powerhouse with a leading position in TV, OTT, and content creation. The FY23 financials show that ZEEL and Sony's combined revenue was almost Rs 15,000 crore. The Sony-Zee deal sought to create India’s biggest entertainment company with the financial muscle to challenge global powerhouses, including Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., as well as local conglomerates such as
Reliance Industries Ltd
which is striking a deal with Disney.
The deal will help expand Sony’s media business in the world’s most populous country, with over 75 television channels and a market share of 37%, ahead of Disney-owned Star’s 24%, according to a note from brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. The Sony-Zee behemoth will directly compete in a near-duopoly with Reliance-Disney joint venture which is in the works.
However, the deal has run into various problems.
Creditors
IDBI Bank
and Axis Finance had earlier filed pleas against the merger of Zee Entertainment Enterprise with Culver Max Entertainment, formerly Sony Pictures Networks India. They had challenged the August 10, 2023, order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to approve the merger. The NCLT, in its decision to approve the merger, rejected requests from financial institutions like
IDBI
Trusteeship, IDBI Bank, Axis Finance, JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co, and Imax Corp.
IDBI and Axis Finance contested this decision by appealing to the NCLAT.
On December 15, NCLAT declined to issue a stay order on the merger. The tribunal has, however, issued notice in the plea challenging the mega merger. It has listed the case for hearing on January 8. This means the merger is out of the danger zone but not the shadow of the legal suit.

Dish TV India
has approved the appointment of
Sunil Khanna
as an independent director and
Ravi Bhushan Puri
as executive director.
The company said the approval of the shareholders will be sought in terms of applicable regulatory provisions. It added that the appointment will be valid from the effective date until September 30, 2024.
The appointments will become effective on the date of receipt of the approval of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) or the date on which the number of
directors
on the board falls below the statutory minimum number of three directors, whichever is earlier.
Dish TV said Puri will not be entitled to any additional remuneration in respect of the aforesaid appointment, and he will continue to draw remuneration as ‘Corporate Head—Broadcasting' of the company.
Earlier, the National Stock Exchange (
BSE
) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) had imposed fines of over Rs 10 lakh on
Dish TV
for board composition-related violations.
Live Events
Dish TV's board strength has been less than the SEBI-mandated six directors since March 3 due to the non-approval of the appointment of four independent directors by the company's shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held on March 3 and the resignation of independent director Zohra Chatterji with effect from June 2.
The company had said that it has taken the required steps to ensure compliance with Regulations 17(1) and 19 of the Listing Regulations, and the said non-compliance in the reduction of directors is beyond its control.
Dish TV, at its meeting held on September 21, 2023, appointed Aanchal David as Independent Director of the Company with effect from September 26, 2023, subject to shareholders’ approval.
Further, at its meeting held on September 29, 2023, the company appointed Rajesh Sahni and Virender Kumar Tagra as non-executive, non-independent directors of the company with effect from September 29, 2023, subject to shareholders’ approval.
The company also re-appointed Shankar Aggarwal as Independent Director of the Company for a second term of 5 years, with effect from October 25, 2023, subject to shareholders’ approval at its meeting held on October 21, 2023.
Dish TV will be convening an EGM of the shareholders on December 22 at 12:30 pm through video conferencing.

Why the birth of a $10 bn media & entertainment behemoth still buffering up,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-sony-merger-why-the-birth-of-a-10-bn-media-entertainment-behemoth-still-buffering-up/articleshow/106083402.cms,18-12-2023,"The plot has thickened for India's media & entertainment (M&E) sector. A deal which would create a $10 billion media and entertainment (M&E) giant has run into various problems. Merger of Japan's
Sony
group's Indian arm Sony Pictures Networks India (now known as Culver Max Entertainment) and
Zee
Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. is likely to be put off by several months. Zee has asked Sony to push back the deadline of December 21, 2023, for the merger which was inked on December 22, 2021.
The Sony-Zee deal sought to create India’s biggest entertainment company with the financial muscle to challenge global powerhouses, including
Netflix
Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., as well as local conglomerates such as Reliance Industries Ltd which is striking a deal with Disney.
If the deal is done, it will help expand Sony’s media business in the world’s most populous country, with over 75 television channels and a market share of 37%, ahead of Disney-owned Star’s 24%, according to a note from brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. The Sony-Zee behemoth will directly compete in a near-duopoly with Reliance-Disney joint venture which is in the works.
In December 2021, Sony and Zee signed definitive agreements to merge. Sony will indirectly hold a majority of 50.86% of the combined company; the founders of ZEEL will hold 3.99%; and the other ZEEL shareholders will hold a 45.15% stake. The deal was anticipated to conclude in 8-10 months. However, two years down the line, it is yet to be completed due to regulatory investigation and legal suits, among other things, involving Zee and its promoters including MD & CEO Punit Goenka.
Incidentally, Zee has asked Sony to push back the deadline of December 21 a day after its annual general meeting on Saturday, where two of its special resolutions to reappoint Vivek Mehra and Sasha Mirchandani as independent directors were rejected by the shareholders.
Live Events
The challenge by creditors
In August, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) allowed the merger of Zee and Sony. The tribunal also dismissed all objections regarding the merger. It heard arguments from creditors, including Axis Finance, JC Flower Asset Reconstruction Co, IDBI Bank, Imax Corp and IDBI Trusteeship.
Zee and Sony had approached the tribunal for sanctioning the merger after obtaining permissions from National Stock Exchange, BSE and sectoral regulators such as the Competition Commission of India and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). However, the process stopped at the tribunal when a few creditors raised objections. Several creditors of Essel Group raised objections against the non-compete clause added to the scheme.
In September, creditors IDBI Bank and Axis Finance challenged the August order of NCLT to approve the merger and asked for a stay on it. Earlier, the Bombay High Court had dismissed an application filed by Axis Finance to implead Zee, Essel Mauritius, and Sony in its commercial summary suit against Zee promoter Subhash Chandra Goenka and others. The company was seeking to recover Rs 146 crore from Subhash Chandra Goenka.
A few days ago, NCLT declined to issue a stay order on the merger, ET Now reported. The tribunal has, however, issued notice in the plea challenging the mega merger. It has listed the case for hearing on January 8. This means the merger is out of the danger zone but not the shadow of the legal suit.
The Sebi overhang
Though the merger has received all the key approvals, things are stuck on the promoter's status: the differences between Sony and Zee over the appointment of Punit Goenka -- Subhash Goenka's son -- as the proposed merged entity's MD & CEO. As reported first by ET, Sony had told Goenka that he can't be the MD & CEO of the proposed entity since he continues to be under the Sebi investigation for alleged misappropriation of funds. Sony is now pushing for the appointment of its long-time India executive, NP Singh, as the CEO of the new entity.
But Zee insists that Punit Goenka will helm the new entity, as agreed in the pact signed in 2021. Sony is reportedly wary of his appointment given the Sebi probe against him. Sebi had alleged in June that Zee faked the recovery of loans to cover private financing deals by its founder, Subhash Chandra. Chandra and his son, Goenka, “abused their position” and siphoned off funds, Sebi alleged in an interim order. While Goenka got a reprieve from NCLT against the Sebi order (NCLT had earlier barred him from being an executive or director in a listed company), reportedly Sony still views the ongoing probe as an overhanging corporate governance issue.
What lies ahead for the deal?
Despite various regulatory and legal challenges, deal is not likely to fall through, ""As per our assessment, extension in the merger timeline won’t have a major regulatory hurdle, as the NCLT approval is not time-bound, and this is only a mutually agreed date between two parties subject to shareholder and Board approvals; further appeals filed by Axis and other lenders in NCLAT too won’t negatively impact merger, as NCLT approval is without any conditions,"" Elara Capital SVP and media analyst Karan Taurani has told ET.
Earlier, lawyer Abhishek Malhotra had listed potential outcomes for the merger deal. In the first scenario, while the Sebi probe is on, someone from Sony might become the CEO of the merged entity, and the CFO might be from Zee. They can take this arrangement forward and change it back to the original understanding as soon as Punit gets the clean chit. The second scenario could be that Punit nominates someone else from Zee as the CEO of the merged entity.
In the third scenario, Punit might say that there's no impediment to him being the MD & CEO since there is a stay currently on the Sebi order. He might argue that the Sebi probe could last longer than eight months, so let him be the MD & CEO, and the probe can continue.
In an interview with ET in June, Punit Goenka had said that the merger would take place whether he was the CEO or not.

"Zee Entertainment sends letter to Sony Group Corporation, requesting an extension of cutoff to complete merger",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-entertainment-sends-letter-to-sony-group-corporation-requesting-an-extension-of-cutoff-to-complete-merger/articleshow/106066169.cms,18-12-2023,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL) has requested Sony Group companies to extend the date for concluding their merger as the December 21 cut-off date looms large.
In a regulatory filing on Sunday, ZEEL said it has requested Sony Group Corporation-owned Culver Max Entertainment Pvt Ltd (CMEPL) and Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd (BEPL) “to extend the date required to make the scheme effective as per the terms of the merger cooperation agreement” dated December 22, 2021.
Once Sony agrees to extend the date, the two parties will jointly decide the new cut-off date, people aware of the development told ET.
The merger of ZEEL, Culver Max (formerly Sony Pictures Networks India), and Bangla Entertainment would create a multi-billion-dollar media giant that had combined revenues of roughly Rs 15,000 crore in FY23.
Elara Capital SVP and media analyst Karan Taurani said the probability of the merger going through remains high.

“As per our assessment, extension in the merger timeline won’t have a major regulatory hurdle as the NCLT approval is not time-bound, and this is only a mutually agreed date between two parties, subject to shareholder and board approvals,” he said. “Appeals filed by Axis and other lenders in NCLAT, too, won’t negatively impact the merger as NCLT approval is without any conditions,” Taurani added.
ZEEL has sent the letter to Sony a day after its annual general meeting (AGM), where two of its special resolutions to reappoint Vivek Mehra and Sasha Mirchandani as independent directors were rejected by the shareholders.
On December 14, Adesh Kumar Gupta had decided to quit as the non-executive, non-independent director of ZEEL.
Gupta was part of the firm’s special merger implementation committee, which was formed to oversee its merger with Sony and includes top officials including managing director and CEO
Punit Goenka
.
The Sony-Zee merger has received all the key approvals, including from the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal, and the stock exchanges.
However, differences between Sony and Zee over the proposed appointment of Punit Goenka as the merged entity’s MD and CEO have delayed the merger.
As reported first by ET, Sony has told Goenka that he can’t be the MD & CEO of the proposed entity since he continues to be under the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) investigation for alleged misappropriation of funds.
Sony is pushing for the appointment of its long-time India executive
NP Singh
as CEO of the new entity.
“Sony is trying its best to convince Goenka to make way for Singh and has offered him an advisory role in the merged company, along with a higher cash payout in the form of a non-compete fee,” said a top media executive who is aware of the discussions between the two parties. “Goenka, however, has stuck to his guns, so far at least,” the person added.
According to a media expert, Sony’s concerns over Goenka are justified since, should something go wrong in its India media unit, it will face severe consequences in the US and Japan where corporate governance standards are very strict.
“Even if Sony allows the merger to go ahead with Goenka at the helm, their biggest concern is the possibility of other serious allegations of irregularities coming out against him. The implications for Sony are massive in the US and Japan,” the person said.
Goenka has argued that the merger scheme agreed upon between the two parties should be implemented in its entirety. He has also reiterated that the Securities Appellate Tribunal has overturned the Sebi ban against him, which paves the path for him to become chief of Sony-Zee.
Sebi had barred Goenka and his father Subhash Chandra from holding directorships and top positions in any listed companies, including Sony-Zee.
“It looks very unlikely that Punit will settle for anything less than the MD & CEO posts of the merged entity, but he is also under pressure from ZEEL shareholders to conclude the merger at the earliest,” said another executive.
As per the merger scheme agreed upon between the two parties, Goenka was to serve as the MD & CEO of Sony-Zee for a period of five years from the effective date, subject to the terms and conditions as agreed between the two entities.
A legal expert said the middle path for both parties would be to allow the merger to proceed with Goenka as the MD & CEO. “Sony can always ask Goenka to step down if the allegations of financial irregularities come true after the Sebi investigation is concluded,” he said.

"What 'Pocahontas' tells us about Disney, for better and worse",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/what-pocahontas-tells-us-about-disney-for-better-and-worse/articleshow/106062872.cms,17-12-2023,"Disney's animated achievements -- certain ones -- are imprinted on our brains, in part because the company reminds us about them seemingly nonstop. Fresh from the
Disney
vault! Restored to its original glory!
""Wish,"" which arrived last month as part of Disney's centennial self-celebration, is a collection of callbacks to classics like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937), ""
Sleeping Beauty
"" (1959), ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989) and ""
The Lion King
"" (1994). Disney theme parks have recently unveiled attractions based on ""
Frozen
"" (2013) and ""
Moana
"" (2016), among others.
But there are also films in Disney's animated canon that the image-conscious company does not talk about much, and the reasons are usually obvious. Some were
box office
failures. A few of the older ones traffic in racist stereotypes.
If we are going to look back at Disney's history with animated movies, however, as the company has invited people to do with its 100th-anniversary bash, the problem films should be part of the discussion. To wrestle with Disney and its legacy -- the good and the bad, the past and the present -- the misfires sometimes offer as much insight as the masterworks.
Consider ""Pocahontas.""
Live Events
Released in 1995 at a time when Walt Disney Animation Studios was experiencing a creative renaissance, ""Pocahontas"" pulls from history and legend to recount -- sort of -- the story of the real-life Native American girl who, in 1607, supposedly saved an English settler, John Smith, after he'd been taken as prisoner by her father's tribe. The film won two Oscars (for song and score) and was celebrated by leading critics for its vibrant color palette and magical realism (a murmuration of autumn leaves, the advice-giving Grandmother Willow). Janet Maslin, reviewing the movie for The New York Times, called it a ""landmark feat of animation.""
""Pocahontas"" also has some severe problems, starting with the title character. Disney depicted her not as a girl of about 11, as historians agree Pocahontas was at the time she interacted with Smith, but as an ultra-voluptuous young woman. Disney took other extreme liberties with the story, in particular inventing a romance between Pocahontas, who was voiced by Irene Bedard, and Smith (Mel Gibson). Disney higher-ups pressed the ""Pocahontas"" creative team to make it more like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which had been a runaway hit at the box office -- presto, a romance.
""Disney made a lot of unfortunate decisions with this movie,"" said Angela Aleiss, a film scholar whose books include ""Hollywood's Native Americans: Stories of Identity and Resistance.""
""It should be a lesson,"" she added of ""Pocahontas,"" which was directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg. ""Why not let Indigenous people tell these stories?""
Recent Disney films like the animated ""Strange World,"" with its gay teenage protagonist, have become cultural flashpoints. But ""Pocahontas"" prompted a full-blown fracas. Some people accused Disney of whitewashing history -- for leaving out the fact, for instance, that Pocahontas died at 21, perhaps of smallpox, after being taken to London and paraded around as an example of a ""civilized savage."" Others blasted ""Pocahontas"" for depicting some white settlers as bigoted plunderers (although historians would argue this was accurate). Some Native Americans winced at the ways in which the film perpetuated the Good Indian stereotype, which posits that worthy Native Americans were those who helped white immigrants. Psychologists complained that Disney's rendering of the hero gave girls yet another impossible body standard to live up to.
For these reasons, ""Pocahontas"" lives in a netherworld at Disney.
The company does not hide it. The movie is available on Disney+, and the character is designated an official Disney Princess. ""Wish"" contains a couple of subtle references to the film. But bring up ""Pocahontas"" at Disney headquarters, and people get visibly tense. The vibe is: Let's please change the subject. A couple of years ago, Disney decided that ""Pocahontas"" would be one of the few animated hits that would not be remade as a live-action spectacle. Too fraught, especially in the social media era. (""Pocahontas"" was very much a hit. It cost about $112 million in today's dollars, and collected $707 million -- less than the Disney movies that preceded it, but a lot of dough all the same.)
Disney declined to comment for this article.
Animation historians contend that ""Pocahontas"" is more important than most people realize -- that the film's challenges have obscured its true standing in Disney's animated oeuvre.
""Pocahontas,"" for instance, ""marked a new turn in Disney storytelling toward empowered heroines,"" said Mindy Johnson, an animation scholar whose books include ""Ink & Paint: The Women of Walt Disney's Animation."" Johnson added, ""Many credit this to 'Mulan.' But 'Pocahontas' paved the way.""
Despite its invented romance, the film ends with Pocahontas spurning Smith's invitation to go with him to England. She chooses to stay with her tribe.
""Pocahontas"" was the first animated Disney film to focus on a woman of color. It was the first (and only) time that Disney made an animated movie about a real person. And in many ways, it was Disney's first overt ""issues"" movie for children. Developed in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, ""Pocahontas"" explored the idea that ""if we don't learn to live with one another, we will destroy ourselves,"" as Peter Schneider, then Disney's animation president, put it in ""The Art of Pocahontas"" by Stephen Rebello.
""Environmental messages are equally present and so relevant, especially today,"" Johnson said.
Disney movies had always had a moral, but this went much further -- and the film's implicit political message freaked some people out: Disney is messing with our kids. The uproar helped push the company back toward lighter material, resulting in comedies like ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and ""Lilo & Stitch.""
A similar shift is going on right now at Disney. The company has become a political punching bag, partly because it has added openly gay, lesbian and queer characters to its animated movies. The emphasis on diversity in some of Disney's live-action films, including ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Marvels"" and ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" has also led to fan complaints. Although Disney has also received positive feedback, the blowback -- and poor ticket sales for some of the films in question -- has prompted Disney to retrench.
""Creators lost sight of what their No. 1 objective needed to be,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said at the Times' DealBook Summit last month. ""We have to entertain first. It's not about messages.""
It should be noted that ""Pocahontas"" has plenty of fans. Some point to the clever, sweeping ways in which the film's songs are visualized. Alan Menken (""The Little Mermaid"") and Stephen Schwartz (""Wicked"") wrote the music, which includes the Oscar-winning ""Colors of the Wind,"" sung by Judy Kuhn.
""A graceful and well-intentioned entry in the Disney canon,"" Sophie Gilbert wrote in a 2015 essay in The Atlantic that defended the film as progressive and feminist. (The magazine also published letters from readers who did not agree.)
Hanay Geiogamah, a former director of the American Indian Studies Center at UCLA, was hired by Disney in the 1990s to consult on ""Pocahontas"" and its straight-to-video sequel, ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World."" In a phone interview, he called working with Disney ""a really positive experience,"" noting that some of his concerns about authenticity (the depiction of dancing and ceremonies, for instance) led to prerelease changes in the film.
""I understood why people were upset, and, at the time, I made my voice heard, too,"" Geiogamah said. ""But you have to remember, at the end of the day, this was a Disney animated fantasy. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how it turned out. Yes, there was a falsity at its core. But it also gave millions of young people a positive impression of Indian life. It wasn't all battles and ugliness and harshness.""
The many opinions are a reminder of how powerful the Disney brand is: People care --
they really care
.
Affinity for the brand runs so deep that it can quickly recover when the company stumbles. Life in the Magic Kingdom goes on. Five months after ""Pocahontas"" arrived in theaters, tresses swinging, Disney released the first film from an experimental new animation company called Pixar. The movie was ""Toy Story,"" and the response was so rapturous that ""Pocahontas"" -- and the fighting around it -- started to fade into history.

ZEEL shareholders reject the reappointment of two independent directors,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zeel-shareholders-reject-the-reappointment-of-two-independent-directors/articleshow/106052459.cms,17-12-2023,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
(
ZEEL
) shareholders have rejected the reappointment of Vivek
Mehra
and
Sasha Mirchandani
as independent directors at the annual general meeting (
AGM
) on Saturday while approving the appointment of Deepu Bansal as an independent director.
The special resolutions seeking the reappointment of Mehra and
Mirchandani
as independent directors didn't receive the requisite 75% yes votes from the shareholders.
Only 47.95% and 71% of the votes were cast in favour of the special resolution for the reappointment of Mehra and Mirchandani as independent directors. The special resolution for Bansal's appointment as an independent director was approved with 99.84% of the vote.
The ordinary resolution to appoint a director in place of Adesh Kumar Gupta, Non-Executive Director, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for re-appointment, became infructuous due to his withdrawal from getting reappointed.
""The Board of Zee Entertainment Enterprises unanimously applauds Mr. Sasha Mirchandani and Mr. Vivek Mehra for their significant contribution made towards the company during their association. As two distinguished and noteworthy names in the corporate sector, Mr. Mirchandani and Mr. Mehra are on the boards of several leading publicly listed companies and have inculcated strong corporate governance ethics over the years,"" said ZEEL chairman R. Gopalan.

He noted that Adani's investment will help IANS grow its presence in social media and video verticals. ""We will also bolster our headcount going forward. We have 200 employees in our editorial team in India and abroad,"" he said.
The share purchase agreement between AMG Media with IANS and Bamzai was signed on December 15.
IANS India has an authorized and paid-up share capital of Rs 20 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, respectively. The company recorded revenues of Rs 11.86 crore, Rs 9.38 crore, and Rs 10.33 crore in FY23, FY22, and FY21, respectively.
The IANS deal marks Adani Group's third major acquisition in the news media sector in two years. Within the media and entertainment sector, the group sees news media as a strategic area of importance.
The company's media arm, AMG Media Networks, acquired Raghav Bahl-promoted
Quintillion Business Media
in two separate transactions for a cumulative sum of over Rs 100 crore. It first took a 49% stake in March 2022 for Rs 47.8 crore and then bought the remaining 51% in August for Rs 52.45 crore.
Subsequently, the company acquired a 64.71% stake in Prannoy and Radhika Roy-promoted
NDTV
in separate transactions for a cash consideration of Rs 900.69 crore. NDTV owns and operates the news channels NDTV 24x7, NDTV India, and NDTV Profit, apart from the digital news platform NDTV.com. NDTV is accessible in 67 countries through a combination of dedicated feeds and content syndication.
Quintillion Business Media's digital business news platform, BQ Prime, has merged with NDTV Profit, which was relaunched recently as a TV and digital business news platform.
In its FY23 annual report, Adani Enterprises said news and information are the most powerful segments within the media and entertainment industry, despite being of a smaller size compared to other entertainment segments.
""News and information provides 1.4 billion Indians with relevant, credible, up-to-date, anytime/anywhere service on a device of their choice. Moreover, considering the interest of the world at large in India’s resurgence and economic potential, there is a growing need in this segment,"" the company stated.
Established in 1986, IANS has six business verticals, including IANS News Service (English and Hindi), IANS Multimedia, IANS Publishing, IANS Media Consultancy, IANS Software Services, and IANS Mobile Services.

Disney and India's Reliance, which each have a major streaming service as well as 120 TV channels between them, are looking at merging into an entity in which Ambani's group would likely have a majority stake, sources said this week.
In particular, a deal could benefit Disney whose Hotstar streaming app has been loss-making. CEO Bob Iger said last month that while Disney's TV channels were doing well in India, other parts of the business were struggling and it was seeking to ""improve the bottom line.""

The Zee-Sony plan cleared a review by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year and could close in the coming weeks. The two companies have said they will divest three of Zee's Hindi TV channels as part of their agreement for regulatory acceptance.
Although Netflix and Amazon also compete in India's $28 billion media and entertainment market, the emergence of two behemoths would probably create a duopoly wielding anti-competitive power over advertisers, users and content creators, antitrust lawyers said.
""This deal may get closer scrutiny because of the increased concentration of market power post the Zee-Sony merger. That makes their path to CCI approval more challenging,"" said Avimukt Dar, founding partner at India's IndusLaw.
Disney declined to comment. Reliance, its broadcast unit Viacom18 and the CCI did not respond to Reuters queries.
One key area of regulatory scrutiny for a Disney-Reliance merger would be their streaming businesses and their power over advertising during cricket - a sport that commands fanatical devotion in India.
Disney Hotstar, India's biggest streaming app with 38 million users, owns the rights for International Cricket Council's matches in India until 2027, while Reliance's growing JioCinema app has the rights for popular cricket league IPL.
The CCI would be worried that the ""combined entity, due to its strong market presence in streaming can command their own rates and advertisers will be left without bargaining power,"" said Vaibhav Choukse, head of competition law at Indian law firm JSA.
In TV too, there is much that might displease regulators.
Viacom18's 38 channels include Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, while Disney, whose Star brand has been a household name for decades in India, has 80.
Elara Capital estimates Disney and Viacom18 together will have the biggest share of the TV ads market at 43% while Zee-Sony would have 25%, making it difficult for others to compete.
Estimates from the CCI document approving the Zee-Sony merger also underscore the potential pricing power of a Disney and Viacom18 combination.
In Hindi entertainment channels, for example, as of last year Disney and Viacom18 had a combined share of 30% to 40%, compared with Zee-Sony's 30-35%, the document shows.
In local language Marathi channels, Disney had market share of 50-55% and when combined with Viacom18 that would rise to between 65% and 75%. In Bengali language entertainment channels, the two would command as much as 50% market share.
""If the market shares of the parties exceed 40-50% in any market, CCI is likely to conduct a detailed investigation,"" said Choukse.
While divesting certain channels would be an option to assuage CCI's concerns, the merged entity could also offer commitments to not raise ad rates for a certain period, according to Gautam Shahi of Dua Associates.

Zee-Sony Merger: NCLAT refuses to halt mega merger to create media giant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-sony-merger-nclat-refuses-to-halt-mega-merger-to-create-media-giant/articleshow/106013473.cms,15-12-2023,"India's tribunal court has declined to issue a stay order on Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) and Sony's merger to create a $10 billion media giant, according to ET Now.
Shares of Zee rose following the news and hit day's high of Rs 286.50. It was last trading 1.6% higher on BSE Sensex, which continued its record rally and was up 0.7% at 70,980.
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has however issued notice in the plea challenging the mega merger. It has listed the case for hearing on January 8.
Creditors IDBI Bank and Axis Finance had earlier filed pleas against the merger of Zee Entertainment Enterprise with Culver Max Entertainment, formerly Sony Pictures Networks India. They had challenged the August 10, 2023, order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to approve the merger. The NCLT, in its decision to approve the merger, rejected requests from financial institutions like IDBI Trusteeship, IDBI Bank, Axis Finance, JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co, and Imax Corp.
IDBI and Axis Finance contested this decision by appealing to the NCLAT.

During the last hearing on October 31, the NCLAT had moved the cases to a panel chaired by Justice (retd) Ashok Bhushan.
Various operational and financial creditors had objected to the Zee-Sony merger scheme in the NCLT. The company had reached a settlement with IDBI Bank, IndusInd Bank, and the Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS).
In August 2023, the Bombay High Court dismissed an application filed by Axis Finance to implead Zee, Essel Mauritius, and Sony in its commercial summary suit against ZEEL promoter Subhash Chandra Goenka and others. The company was seeking to recover Rs 146 crore from Subhash Chandra Goenka.
In December 2021, Sony and ZEEL signed definitive agreements to merge. Sony will indirectly hold a majority of 50.86% of the combined company; the founders of ZEEL will hold 3.99%; and the other ZEEL shareholders will hold a 45.15% stake.
Sony and Zee signed a merger agreement in December 2021. The deal was anticipated to conclude in 8-10 months. However, two years down the line, it is yet to be completed due to the cases filed by financial institutions against ZEEL and the Sebi order against the company’s promoters.
Once completed, the merger will lead to the creation of a multibillion-dollar media powerhouse with a leading position in TV, OTT, and content creation. The FY23 financials show that ZEEL and Sony's combined revenue was almost Rs 15,000 crore.

Influencers lawyer up to help protect personal brands,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/influencers-lawyer-up-to-help-protect-personal-brands/articleshow/105970373.cms,14-12-2023,"Priya Raina, an actor, singer, and
social media
influencer, is contemplating launching her label to bring Kashmiri crafts and arts into the mainstream. However, before that, she is making rounds at the lawyer's offices to make sure her brand as a social media influencer remains solid and intact.
""I have made conscious efforts to increasingly use original content on social media and now when planning my label, I want to make sure that even my social media profile remains protected from any copycats or imposters,"" said Raina. ""When corporates or brands approach me for any collaboration, I have started to consult lawyers to make sure that IPR (intellectual property rights) regarding my social media profile remains solid,"" she further added.
Increasingly more and more social media
influencers
are reaching out to lawyers to protect
IP rights
that they have created on social media and to negotiate better
contracts
with brands and agencies.
Content creators from the field of cooking to beauty and auto to fitness, on platforms such as Meta-owned
Instagram
or Alphabet-owned YouTube, are seeking lawyers' help to protect their IP rights to help them protect brands and even negotiate contracts with brands and other third parties.
Live Events
""We are witnessing a trend where many social media influencers are approaching lawyers as they feel many brands are misusing their IP rights,"" said Viraj Sheth, co-founder and CEO of talent management and digital media firm
Monk Entertainment
. ""Albeit, most such influencers are still unaware of their rights.""
Monk Entertainment manages over 100 creators across diverse categories of fashion, food, comedy, music, and lifestyle including Niharika NM, Your Food Lab, Yashraj Mukhate, and Madan Gowri.
The influencer marketing industry's value is estimated to reach '2,200 crore by 2025, according to a report by influencer.in.
Experts feel that the awareness is not restricted to protecting the influencer's identity but some of them are making efforts to translate it into consumer brands, which has led to this trend.
Priyanka Khimani, founder of media & entertainment advisory law firm Khimani & Associates, recognised that influencers in India are rapidly catching up with the Western trend of protecting their IP rights. ""Increasingly, we are seeing many influencers becoming entrepreneurs and launching their own brands and product lines; or seeking equity participation to promote or invest in other brands and ventures. This is typically when they seek legal help"" said Khimani.
""Often, when social media influencers jump on an ongoing trend to create branded content, they inadvertently infringe someone else's IP rights and, in those situations too, they reach out to lawyers to try and figure out a solution,"" she added.
Meghna Kamdar, who runs the channel 'Meghna's Food Magic' on platforms such as YouTube and Instagram said she's contemplating consulting lawyers for a host of issues.
""A lot of handles download our content and post on their handle without permission; and by removing our names,"" said Kamdar. ""I am not worried about my brand, because I am a brand. But yes, people do create handles of look-alike names, which we get taken down. Having said that, if I were to do some merchandise or products etc. in future, then yes, it would definitely be an area where legal protection would be needed,"" she adds.

BBC
staff members on Tuesday announced plans to leave the organisation and form a
new entity
in India named Collective Newsroom, which will provide services ""as commissioned by the BBC"" and in compliance with the country's foreign direct investment (FDI) rules. According to a statement from the UK-based public service broadcaster,
Collective Newsroom
has been established as an
Indian company
that is wholly owned by Indian citizens. It replaces
BBC World Service India
to continue to provide language-based content.
The move follows the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) premises in India facing ""surveys"" by tax authorities and an ensuing investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) over alleged FDI violations earlier this year.
""The establishment of Collective Newsroom Private Limited ensures the BBC and Collective Newsroom can meet their shared commitment to Indian audiences and cover stories on India that matter to global audiences. It is in compliance with the Indian Foreign Direct Investment law,"" reads the BBC statement.
""Collective Newsroom has been established as an Indian company, wholly owned by Indian citizens, with four existing staff members leaving the BBC to lead Collective Newsroom. These senior leaders have a wealth of editorial and programme-making experience,"" it said.
""The BBC will commission Collective Newsroom to produce its six Indian language services as well as Indian digital output and
Indian YouTube
channel in English for audiences globally,"" it added.

Service Provider
In its regulatory filings, BBC World Service India disclosed that it had received a letter from the ministry of information and broadcasting dated March 31, for alleged non-compliance with FDI norms. The company said it has sought time until March 31, 2024, for compliance, and communicated its restructuring proposals to the ministry.
People aware of the development told ET that one of the options being explored by the company is to offer stakes to some of its executives. Some key functionaries in India include Rupa Jha, head of BBC News India; Mukesh Sharma, head of African language services, BBC News; and Sanjoy Mazumdar, deputy managing editor, Asia, at BBC World Service.
BBC World Service India acts as a service provider to BBC UK for the production of television, radio and website content in Hindi and other Indian regional languages, as well as English. In FY23, the company earned a service fee of Rs 129.4 crore from BBC UK for content produced, and a programming fee of Rs 77 lakh from licensing content to radio stations, TV channels and digital platforms.
Under the Scanner
In September 2019, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) capped FDI in digital news at 26% under the government approval route.
The broadcasting ministry issued a public notice on November 16, 2020, asking all eligible digital news entities with foreign investment over 26% to take the necessary steps to bring the foreign investment down to 26% by October 15, 2021.
In February, BBC World Service India and BBC Global News India premises were surveyed by income tax officials. Subsequently, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence issued a notice for investigation. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) had also issued notices to the two companies in April under provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.
""Pending the ongoing discussions with the ministry and ED, it is not possible, at this stage, to reliably estimate the consequent implications, including provisions, if any, that may need to be recognised in the financial statement,"" BBC World Service said in its filing for FY23.
In its annual report,
BBC Group
noted that a potential contingent liability had been identified following the commencement of the Indian government's tax survey on BBC activities in the country in February this year. It added that the company had cooperated in full, and will continue to do so, with all demands, including document and information requests, supported by its external legal and tax advisers.
As part of its residual risk and 2023-24 planned activities, the company said it will undertake the implementation of a remedial plan to adhere to local laws and regulations in India.
Distribution & Services
BBC Global News India acts as the distributor of BBC World News and the CBeebies Channel and is also a service provider to BBC Global News for advertising, sales and marketing activities in various territories, including India.
The company said the BBC World News channel was granted downlinking permission in India from the broadcasting ministry till July 7. It added that the application seeking permission for the next 10 years has been filed. It has had its annual permission renewed for the downlinking of children's entertainment TV channel CBeebies until April 2, 2024.
In FY23, BBC Global News India recorded revenue and profit of Rs 43.4 crore and Rs 1.3 crore, respectively.
Early this year, the government banned a BBC documentary on the Prime Minister that had been broadcast in the UK, calling it propaganda.

"SC agrees to hear IDBI Trusteeship Services’ appeal, issues notice to Essel group entities",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sc-agrees-to-hear-idbi-trusteeship-services-appeal-issues-notice-to-essel-gp-entities/articleshow/105910593.cms,11-12-2023,"The
Supreme Court
on Monday sought response from
Essel
group firms - Cyquator Media Services Pvt Ltd and Direct Media Distribution Ventures on the
IDBI
Trusteeship Services’ appeal against a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (
NCLAT
) September order that rejected its
insolvency plea
against the firms.
A bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.
On September 12, the appellate tribunal had dismissed an insolvency petition against
Direct Media Ventures
and two days later, it also rejected the insolvency petition against Cyquator Media, a promoter group company of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
. The NCLAT had noted that the default took place in June 2020, which was covered under the period of exclusion under Section 10A from insolvency and bankruptcy cases due to COVID-19.
Challenging the NCLAT’s order, IDBI through counsel Gaurav Mitra and Nagarkatti Kartik Uday asked the SC to consider “whether the sale of the pledged shares subsequent to the suspension period under Section 10A, amounts to a fresh cause of action entitling it to file a Section 7 petition and further whether the bar under Section 10A whittles down or dilutes the obligations of a corporate debtor under a corporate guarantee, which is continuing and subsisting and under which obligations of the corporate debtor are not discharged, released, impaired or otherwise affected by reason of any legal limitation, till the discharge of all obligations of the corporate debtor.”
Essel Infraprojects, another Essel group company, had proposed to issue 425 rated, unlisted, redeemable, non-convertible debentures aggregating a nominal value of Rs 425 crore. IDBI Trusteeship had agreed to act as debenture trustee. A debenture trust deed was executed between
IDBI Trusteeship Services and Essel
for which Cyquator Media and Direct Media Ventures jointly stood as corporate guarantors. Last year, IDBI Trusteeship issued a demand notice to Direct Media and Cyquator to make payment of Rs 592 crore with 12% interest. While it filed an insolvency plea against Cyquator for default in payment in May 2022, the National Company Law Tribunal dismissed the IDBI Trusteeship's insolvency plea in June 2023.
Live Events
The appeal filed by Manilal Kher Ambalal and Co stated that after the dismissal of petitions, which were filed by the two entities against its notice of demand, by the Delhi High Court, IDBI had invoked the pledge of securities and sold 43,47,500 pledged shares of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises in the open market in various tranches and realized Rs 92.34 crore and accordingly gave credit to that effect to Essel.
It further contended that while the appellate authority without considering the facts of the case had upheld the NCLT’s order, it had
held that the Section 7 petition was barred by Section 10A of the IBC, on the ground that the liability of the two Essel entities to make the outstanding payment arose on the date of invocation of the guarantee, i.e., on June 12, 2020, as per which June 16, 2020 was the date on which the default was committed.

Addressable TV advertising technology helps advertisers to segment TV audiences selectively, delivering distinct ads to various households, regardless of their shared content consumption. Advertising effectively allows businesses to reach out to their potential customers and remind them of their interest in the brand, the company said.
This comes at a time when India is seeing increasing penetration of OTTs with rapid adoption of Internet that enables
targeted ads
on digital platforms. India's burgeoning online population presents a colossal market for businesses leveraging re-targeting advertising.
However, Tata is now bringing the tech to non-connected TVs as well, which should be adding to the revenues as well.
""Platforms have never had access to advertising revenue. This makes us a stakeholder in that stream of revenue too,"" Harit Nagpal, MD & CEO, Tata Play, told ET Online.
""The service will encourage advertisers to advertise more because of the efficiencies achieved due to reduction in spill over. Niche brands which did not hitherto advertise will also find the ROIs compelling,"" he added.
Addressable
TV ads
represent a groundbreaking shift in TV advertising by combining traditional linear TV with digital capabilities, the company said. TV ads play a crucial role in initial brand exposure. Through Tata Play's Addressable Ads solution, advertisers can enhance their return on investment by utilising features such as targeted advertising and impression purchasing, it added.
Targeted ads strategic approach optimises budgets by directing ads to individuals who have displayed prior interest, ensuring higher conversion rates compared to broader campaigns. Targeting advertising in India capitalises on user engagement, proving to be a cost-effective and efficient method for businesses aiming to engage a receptive audience and drive sales.
""While television delivers the highest advertising reach for brands, it doesn’t offer sharper targeting. With our targeted ad delivery, we can now split a TV spot into multiple beams with each beam carrying messages to distinctive audience cohorts, as required by the advertisers,” said Nagpal.

Broadcasting Bill may lead to regulatory issues: IBDF President K Madhavan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/broadcasting-bill-may-lead-to-regulatory-issues-disney-star-chief/articleshow/105883956.cms,11-12-2023,"K. Madhavan
, who is also the chief of
Disney Star
, was recently re-elected as the president of the Indian Broadcasting & Digital Foundation (
IBDF
) for the third time. In an interview with
ET
's Javed Farooqui, Madhavan expressed concerns about the draft Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill (BSRB) put out by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB) for public consultation and its impact on creative freedom. He also feels that both pay-TV and OTT will continue to co-exist as they complement each other. Excerpts:
You have been re-elected as IBDF president for the third time. What will be your key priorities going forward?
As IBDF, we have made significant progress over the last couple of years by partnering with regulators and policymakers to create a more conducive environment for the M&E industry. In our interactions with the MIB and regulators, we have highlighted the need for light touch regulation, especially in the context of the content self-regulatory framework, market-driven pricing and forbearance on distribution framework, a
National Broadcasting Policy
(NBP), and developing India as a global content and tech hub.
We have also highlighted the need to recognize, protect, and uphold the primacy of intellectual property rights protection in content-driven industries and sector-specific copyright enforcement measures. As an industry, our priorities are to facilitate industry stakeholders to grow the M&E sector to $100 billion by the year 2030.
Last year, we played a pivotal role in the notification of New Tariff Order (NTO) 3.0, and we have furthered the cause of the industry by highlighting concerns on key issues including spectrum auction for 5G deployment in C Band and concerns around convergence of the broadcasting sector with telecom.

We have put in place a robust system of self-regulation of broadcast and digital content, and I remain confident of moving to an environment of regulatory forbearance with light touch regulation that will allow participants in the M&E industry to adapt and evolve more nimbly.
What are your views on the Broadcast Services Regulation Bill and its impact on the M&E sector?
As you are already aware, it’s been only a few weeks since the bill was put up for public consultation and we are in the process of reviewing its contents. The Bill as released by MIB for public consultation, needs a serious relook and we have requested some time to revert with our comments. In July, the MIB had requested TRAI to give its recommendations on a NBP, that would define the vision, mission, and policy principles for the broadcasting industry. IBDF is of the view that a new policy should be designed that is flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of situations and allows for innovation and creativity to grow the industry.
By consolidating various guidelines and rules for TV, Radio, and OTT, the bill is attempting to force-fit these services, especially the video streaming services provided by OTT, into a linear broadcasting framework. This could result in structural issues in their regulation.
For instance, the Bill defines “broadcasting” as a “one-to-many” transmission and includes OTT platforms, which use one-to-one transmissions. Additionally, the Bill categorizes “OTT broadcasting service operators” as “broadcasting network operators” (BNOs), whereas it is the telecom and internet service providers that operate the networks, unlike linear broadcasting where DPOs operate and manage the network.
Television is a medium where viewers consume content as per a prescribed schedule. OTT services are pull-based, with consumers making informed choices about the time and type of content they want to watch. Bringing OTT under the same regulatory framework will undermine this distinctive feature of OTT.
Also, the Bill by adding the additional requirement of Content Evaluation Committees and government oversight through a Broadcast Advisory Council will not only curb creative freedom on OTT but will end up micro-managing content creation and programming in both TV and OTT. This should be looked at through the existing industry self-regulatory bodies like BCCC and DMCRC which have been in existence for almost a decade and have played a pivotal role in regulating content without hampering creative freedom.
You met PM Modi in July. What were the key issues that you discussed with him?
One of the key issues that was discussed with the Prime Minister was the need to introduce a national policy on media and entertainment for the enhancement of the broadcasting industry which would allow for more efficient functioning and monitoring of the industry, benefitting both industry participants as well as regulatory bodies. The Prime Minister was very laudatory of the role that the industry has played in raising the profile of local sports like Kabaddi in the country and was keen that we develop India as a sporting nation, going much beyond just cricket.
The M&E sector is undergoing considerable transformation because of the convergence of technology, telecom, and media. How will convergence affect the industry?
Technology has proven to be a huge disruptor, not just in the M&E industry, but across every industry, the end beneficiary being the consumer. However, within the media & entertainment industry, we need to view this in context. We have two significant mediums – TV and OTT – that while largely serving similar audiences, are very different. TV is a push-based medium that is based on appointment viewing while OTT is a pull-based medium that allows the viewer to watch the content of their choice at the time of their choice and convenience. The draft Broadcast Services Regulation Bill 2023 has suggested that these mediums be brought under a single regulatory framework, but we are not in favour of this approach.
Broadcast sector profitability has come under stress due to a subdued ad market and sluggish growth in subscription revenue. How do you see FY24 and FY25 panning out for the sector as a whole?
The broadcast sector has no doubt faced some challenges since the last quarter of the calendar year 2022, fuelled in large part by global macroeconomic factors such as inflationary pressures and the disruption of global supply chains due to certain geopolitical events. From an advertisement revenue standpoint as well, we saw some of the traditional advertisers such as the start-up eco-system, automobile companies, and more recently, online betting platforms stay away from TV advertising and while that did create a temporary vacuum, we are seeing a gradual revival. During the current festive season, we’ve seen early signs of revival compared to last year and expect that this will hold up in the months ahead.
Nearly a third of Indian households do not yet have a television set and as income and aspiration levels grow, we expect these households to gradually come into the Pay TV universe. India is expected to grow 6.3% in FY24 – the fastest-growing major economy in the world – the financial markets are at all-time highs which is reflective of the hugely positive sentiment regarding the prospects of the Indian economy, and we expect that the M&E industry is going to be a natural beneficiary of this broad-based growth. We remain bullish about the broadcast sector in the near to medium term.
The pay-TV subscriber base has been on the decline in the last few years. Where do the pay-TV numbers stand today, and have the industry's efforts to stem the decline made any impact?
It is true that as we came out of the Covid period, there was some moderation in the Pay TV universe. However, in the current financial year, we’ve seen a 6 million increase in the number of Pay TV connections to reach a total of 173 million households as per BARC data. So, while there have been reports suggesting that the emergence of OTT has hurt the Pay TV universe, BARC data suggests otherwise. That tells you that TV continues to remain a very strong viewing medium in India, quite unlike developed markets where Pay TV households have been on the decline. This is the only market where TV and digital are growing and the two are complementing each other, especially in the content space. Of course, it is important to bear in mind that broadcasters continue to grapple with the serious issue of under-reporting of Pay TV data by distributors. Content piracy is another serious issue that is standing in the way of the Pay TV industry.
Did the price hike last year impact the overall pay-TV base?
The price hike has not had any adverse impact on the user base. It has grown, which reflects the continued strength of TV as a medium, underpinned by the compelling and engaging content that broadcasters have been serving to their audiences. It has also helped increase the subscription revenues of distributors and broadcasters after a four-year hiatus. This in turn allows us to make more meaningful investments in content and technology. Let us not forget that content costs have escalated severalfold during this period, especially the rights cost for sports and movies.
Where do you see the M&E sector in the next few years?
The M&E industry is presently at Rs 2.1 trillion and is poised to grow to a size of INR2.8trn by the year 2025 – a CAGR of 10.5%. However, the aspiration is for the media & entertainment industry to grow to a size of Rs 8 trillion ($100 billion) by the year 2030, aided by a supportive policy regime. We see secular growth for both TV and Digital over the next few years, with Digital growing at a faster pace than TV. The M&E sector plays a critical role in job creation, both, by way of direct and indirect job creation, and has significant headroom for growth considering that ad revenue presently makes up less than 0.5% of the country’s GDP as opposed to greater than 1% in most developed markets. India has huge potential in establishing itself as an international content and talent hub given the cutting-edge technology it already deploys in the production and post-production of content as well as the superior tech talent that the country has. In the years ahead, the M&E industry is going to play an even more significant role in enhancing India’s soft power on the world stage through powerful storytelling that profiles the country’s rich and diverse culture and heritage.
Despite the sector's common concerns, television channels and distributors remain at odds. Why is this the case?
We’re not at loggerheads of any sort with distributors. Post-NTO, there has been a huge decline in the number of disputes between broadcasters and distributors. We strongly believe that all stakeholders, including distributors, should work together for the betterment of the industry. On a working level, there could be minor disagreements that are being addressed on an ongoing basis. The regulator, TRAI, is also playing a major role in resolving some of the issues like audit of distribution platforms.
While big broadcasters have pulled out GECs offering re-run programming from DD Free Dish, the platform continues to grow at pay-TV's expense. Will there be a rethink of putting channels back on DD Free Dish, or will you continue to keep GECs off DD Free Dish?
Let us understand that these are two different platforms. Pay TV is not in any sort of competition with Free Dish. We see Free Dish as being complementary to Pay TV. Most of the content on Free Dish channels is re-purposed Pay TV content.
Per capita income in India is increasing steadily, and over the last eight years has increased by over 35% to just under Rs 1 lakh. As household incomes increase and aspiration levels of people in semi-urban and rural areas grow, we expect to see a migration of the user base from Free Dish to Pay TV. Further, I would like to draw your attention to the BARC data which suggests that Free Dish households have seen a decline.
When do you expect the broadcast sector to get infrastructure status?
Gaining infrastructure status has been a long pending demand of the industry and we would welcome being accorded this status as it would allow for larger capital outlays to build on an already robust broadcast and digital eco-system.

Removal of safe harbour provisions will harm small firms the most: Google Executive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/removal-of-safe-harbour-provisions-will-harm-small-firms-the-most-google-executive/articleshow/105792146.cms,06-12-2023,"NEW DELHI: The complete removal of
safe harbour
provisions that give
social media
and internet intermediaries protection from third-party content will harm smaller firms the most and they can become very hesitant about innovating new products and services, a senior
Google
executive told ET.
""A framework that has a safe harbour from being responsible for all the content that's travelling over your systems is a cornerstone to ensuring innovation and investment in those technologies. If a company is liable for everything that is going across their system, they can be very hesitant about growing products and services to facilitate content,"" the vice president of government affairs and public policy at Google,
Markham Cho Erickson
said.
Though the idea behind safe harbour as a safety mechanism for social media and other internet intermediaries against third-party content ""is a good principle"", it should not be an excuse for companies to avoid being regulated by the government or from the roles and responsibilities intermediaries have to protect against inappropriate or unlawful or harmful third party content, he said.
""The trend is to not do away with the concept that only people developing bad content should be responsible for the bad content, but that companies that are the fiduciaries have responsibilities. The government should have some way of verifying that those responsibilities (of social media intermediaries) are being executed,"" Erickson said, adding that he looked forward to discussion with the government on these regulations as and when they are included in the Digital India Act.
The government has proposed to replace the 23-year-old Information Technology Act of 2000 with a new legislation which is more suited to the changed face of the internet.

ET had earlier reported the new bill is likely to do away with the blanket immunity that has so far been provided to social media and other internet-based intermediaries against third-party content.
Erickson, who is on an India visit, also said that all regulations around artificial intelligence globally will have to be interoperable with each other and that though the technology is likely to disrupt some of the jobs as they stand today, it will also make all the jobs much more efficient.
India, which is going to be a global leader in
AI technology
development and be an ""important and necessary voice"" in the global dialogue on the policy front should also think about globally interoperable rules.
""What is going to be exciting is India is not going to say we are just going to take the European approach or the UK approach. There is going to be an Indian approach (to AI regulation). That will help enrich the global conversation,"" Erickson said.

FanCode looks to double its paid subscriber base in 2024: Co-founder Yannick Colaco,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/fancode-looks-to-double-its-paid-subscriber-base-in-2024-top-executive/articleshow/105736073.cms,06-12-2023,"Dream Sports-owned sports streaming platform
FanCode
, which claims having 100 million users, is looking to double its paid subscriber base in 2024, a top company executive said.
""Our user base grew by over five times in the last three years, and we expect our subscriber base to grow over 2x in 2024 vs. 2023,"" said
Yannick Colaco
, co-founder of FanCode, which received $50 million in funding from
Dream Sports
in 2021.
In recent times, FanCode has partnered with content aggregators like Prime Video Channels, Airtel XStream and Watcho to reach new audiences and acquire more paid subscribers.
Launched in April 2019, FanCode's revenue model is built around subscription. However, it also allows limited targeted advertising, which helps brands connect with premium-paying audiences.
""Our business model is predicated on a strong subscription model that leverages this D2C relationship and is supported with contextual advertising,"" Colaco said.
Live Events
He noted that the free streaming strategy adopted by JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar is good for the sports content ecosystem as it will expand the market.
According to Colaco, India has over 600 million sports fans, of whom 136 million are avid fans who consume some sport multiple times a week.
FanCode is looking to attract avid sports fans to its platform and offer content that is relevant to them. Apart from cricket and football, the platform also live streams kabaddi, volleyball, basketball and boxing.
""We want to help the sports ecosystem grow. This is part of the Dream Sports vision and is something we continue to strive for every day at FanCode,"" Colaco said while noting that sports fandom in India is still at a nascent stage.
In line with its strategy to tap into different sporting communities, FanCode streamed over 20,000 matches in 17 different sports, which is higher than the 5,000 matches across nine sports last year.
""We want to be able to get more users across different sports. Next year, we are going to have cricket, football and a whole lot of other sports throughout the year,"" he said.
FanCode's content acquisition strategy is dictated by data and analytics, and it works on different models with official sporting bodies, including revenue share and licence fees.
""As we grow our user base and consumption, we can use that data to continuously improve our decision-making in acquiring more content relevant to our users,"" Colaco said.
FanCode is also betting on the sports merchandise business in India. It works with eight IPL teams and runs online megastores for Kolkata Knight Riders, Punjab Kings and Rajasthan Royals.
It also has a two-year partnership with the International Cricket Council (ICC) and a licence to sell merchandise for global football teams such as Paris Saint-Germain, FC Barcelona and Man City.
""The problem we were trying to solve in launching the sports merchandise business was similar. We found that avid sports fans did not have access to fan gear for sports brands that they loved,"" he said.

JioCinema switches to displaying cumulative views for live sports,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/jiocinema-switches-to-displaying-cumulative-views-for-live-sports/articleshow/105664423.cms,01-12-2023,"Mumbai: Viacom18-owned streaming platform
JioCinema
has switched to displaying the number of
cumulative views
for all live sporting events, including cricket, instead of peak concurrent viewers, which has been the norm till now. The platform started displaying cumulative
views
for a live match beginning with the
India vs Australia ODI series
that took place before the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023. The cumulative views for India's first and second T20 matches against Australia were 213 million and 220 million, respectively, people close to the matter said.
They said the platform is most likely to display cumulative views for the upcoming Indian
Premier
League matches as well, instead of peak concurrency that shows the highest number of viewers during a
live stream
. While JioCinema has not made any official statement on the change in display metrics, according to people in the know, the platform has told
advertisers and media
agencies that cumulative views are a more transparent and reliable measurement of viewer
engagement
.
""Views better represent the total engagement for each event, ensuring a transparent and standard data point for our audience and advertisers alike,"" the company has told certain advertisers, according to one of the people. Viacom18 didn't provide a comment until press time on Friday.
Media experts say that cumulative views are already the accepted currency for both YouTube and Meta. The billing for a digital video ad is also done based on impressions served, they add.
""Both cumulative views and peak concurrency are relevant metrics. However, advertisers are more concerned about the reach of their campaign than the tournament reach,"" said Essence Mediacom South Asia chief executive Navin Khemka.

, chairman of the
Indian Premier League
(
IPL
), said the cash-rich league's
media rights
value may reach a staggering $50 billion in the next 20 years.
“If I have to see how it has gone over the last 15 years and if I have to go by estimates going forward, we are expecting media rights to go somewhere close to USD 50 billion by around 2043,"" Dhumal said at RCB Innovation Lab’s Leaders Meet India in Bengaluru. ""Now that cricket is becoming part of the Olympics and with the Women's Premier League taking it to a different level for women's cricket, I see a lot of hope and light at the end of the tunnel. Because of the way it has been happening for the last 15 years, it is only going to get better,” he said.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had set up a
rivalry outside the ground starting IPL
2023 between Disney Star and Mukesh Ambani's flagship OTT platform JioCinema after it split the TV and digital rights of IPL from 2023-2027 to eventually garner a whopping Rs 48,390 crore in total.
Disney Star bagged the TV rights for Rs 23,575 crore and Reliance-backed Viacom18 got digital rights for Rs 23,758 crore.
Dhumal noted that the media rights value for IPL positions it as the world's second-largest sporting entity, following the National Football League (NFL). NFL, the American sporting, had secured a massive $110 billion media agreement spanning 11 years, commencing from last year.

Discussing IPL's pivotal role in shaping India's global image, Dhumal said, IPL's fanbase spans the globe, providing spectators with glimpses of India's diverse culture and heritage.
Matches are held nationwide, from the North to the South, East to West, showcasing India's rich diversity of states, cultures, and languages.
""IPL is the most-watched cricket league in the world. Personally, I feel IPL is the best Make in India brand we can think of post-Independence.

Bob Iger
said on Wednesday he would ""definitely"" step down when his current contract ends in 2026 and that the ABC broadcast network was not for sale.
In a wide-ranging interview at the New York Times Dealbook Conference,
Iger
also said he was ""bullish"" on the prospects for
Shanghai Disneyland
and he expected the company would expand the theme park ""relatively soon.""
Iger, 72, returned to Disney as CEO in November 2022, less than a year after he retired, to revamp the media company after the board ousted his hand-picked successor, Bob Chapek. Iger had planned to stay for two years but agreed to extend his stay through 2026.
Disney's board is undertaking a ""robust"" search for a successor, Iger said, adding that he was ""definitely going to step down"" at the end of his current contract.
After Iger spoke, Disney's board announced it had appointed
Live Events
Morgan Stanley
CEO James P. Gorman and Jeremy Darroch, former group chief executive of Sky, as new directors starting early next year.
Gorman will serve on the succession planning committee, the board said in a statement, and Darroch on the audit committee. Current director Francis deSouza will not stand for re-election at Disney's next annual meeting, the statement said.
Since his return, Iger has restructured the company and streamlined operations to make the business more cost effective. It is on track to exceed the $5 billion in cost savings it promised investors in February.
Disney's ABC unit is not up for sale, Iger said, as the company deals with a decline in linear television with viewers' shift toward streaming. Iger had said earlier this year that networks such as ABC may not be ""core"" to Disney going forward.
In the movie business, Iger said the company had made too many sequels and had made a ""mistake"" by asking Marvel Studios to provide so many series for the Disney+ streaming service.
""Quantity, in our case, limited quality and Marvel suffered greatly from it,"" Iger said.
Iger acknowledged that the issues facing Disney were ""much more challenging than I expected,"" but added: ""I'm not daunted by it. It's just a lot more work.""
He also addressed Disney's decision last week to pause advertising on social media platform X after owner Elon Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory.
Disney felt the association with X following Musk's move ""was not a positive one for us,"" Iger said, adding that units such as ABC News and ESPN were permitted to use the platform to communicate even though advertising was halted.
Shares of Disney closed nearly unchanged at $92.44 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Working towards completing merger deal with Sony: ZEEL,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/working-towards-completing-merger-deal-with-sony-zeel/articleshow/105602339.cms,30-11-2023,"Mumbai:
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
has said it is working towards completing its planned merger deal with Culver Max Entertainment, the India media unit of
Sony
Group Corporation.
""We wish to reiterate that the company is continuing to work towards a successful closure of the proposed merger as per the Composite Scheme of Arrangement approved by the Hon'ble NCLT, Mumbai Bench,"" the company said in a response to stock exchanges.
ZEEL
has also termed as factually inaccurate a Bloomberg news article that suggested the company's planned merger with the India media division of Sony Group Corporation might not proceed. Bloomberg had reported that Sony is likely to send a letter next week to Zee saying the stipulated demands for the merger couldn't be met due to the dispute between the two companies over who would get the CEO position.
As reported first by ET, Sony wants
Punit Goenka
, who was to serve as the MD and CEO of the merged entity, to step aside till he gets cleared by the Securities Exchange Board of India, which is probing allegations of fund diversion against him and his father, Subhash Chandra.
Sony wants the MD & CEO of its India unit, NP Singh, to take over as the CEO of the merged entity.

Disney said the lower ad revenue from Star's sports business was due to decrease of 38% from fewer impressions, 14% from lower rates, and 7% from an unfavourable foreign exchange impact.
Star's expenses from the sports business dropped 20% to $1.02 billion due to lower costs for cricket programming and a favourable foreign exchange impact.
The decrease in cricket programming costs was attributable to fewer IPL matches and lower average costs per match for IPL and International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 World Cup matches.
The company operates 10 Star-branded sports channels in India in 4 languages. Star has rights to various sports programming, including IPL TV rights, ICC digital rights, and Premier League, among others.
Earlier, it held the rights to all IPL, ICC, and BCCI media rights. It lost IPL digital and BCCI media rights to Viacom18, while it sub-licenced the ICC TV rights to Zee Entertainment. Star has committed close to $5 billion in sports rights investment in the last two years on properties like IPL, ICC, and Cricket Australia.

Broadcasting regulation bill and its impact on content world,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/broadcasting-regulation-bill-and-its-impact-on-content-world/articleshow/105571742.cms,28-11-2023,"The Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill 2023, which has been put up for public consultation by the
ministry of information and broadcasting
(
MIB
), has major ramifications for the broadcasting sector since the government is looking to bring diverse platforms and technologies under a single regulatory framework.
With the government aiming to make India a global content production hub, experts point out that the proposed law could impact the
content creation process
as OTT platforms, like TV channels, will be bound by a programme code. Till now, OTT platforms had the freedom to create the kind of content that they wanted. ET decodes the bill.
What is the Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill 2023?
The Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill, 2023, which seeks to replace the three-decade-old Cable Television Networks Regulation Act of 1995 (CTN Act), seeks to broaden the MIB's regulatory framework by including over-the-top (OTT) and digital news platforms along with TV channels and FM radio besides distribution platforms like cable TV, direct to home (DTH),
Internet Protocol Television
(IPTV), and headend in the sky (HITS).
Currently, the MIB regulates cable TV operators and TV channels through the CTN Act. Additionally, it administers Part III of Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and
Digital Media Ethics Code
) Rules, 2021, which regulates OTT and digital news content. However, the proposed legislation will not cover social media intermediaries as specified under the
Information Technology Act
of 2000.

What is the MIB's rationale for introducing the new bill?
The MIB has said that the broadcasting sector has undergone a sea change because of the advent of new technologies and platforms like DTH, IPTV, and OTT, and hence the regulation should keep pace with the changes in the ecosystem. The ministry has argued that the proposed legislation will provide a consolidated legal framework for the entire broadcasting sector, particularly since there are different rules and regulations for different services and platforms.
What are the implications of the bill for the media and entertainment sectors?
While the MIB believes that the proposed legislation will strengthen the self-regulatory mechanism for ensuring compliance with the programme and advertising codes, the broadcasting industry is worried about the introduction of clauses like self-certification of content by the Content Evaluation Committee (CEC), which they believe will impede the creative freedom of TV broadcasters and OTT players alike.
Stakeholders also claim that by requiring CEC approval before disseminating content, the MIB is establishing a body akin to an internal censor board comprised of external members from diverse fields such as women, child welfare advocates, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and minorities.
OTT platforms fear that the MIB will apply outdated TV regulations to their sector through the programme code. For example, the existing programme code for TV channels prohibits content that ""offends against good taste or decency."" The MIB is expected to prescribe different programme codes for TV, radio, and digital.
The broadcasting sector is also concerned about the provisions relating to the seizure of equipment by government officials of both broadcasting services (TV channels, OTT, digital news) and broadcasting networks (Cable, DTH, IPTV) for violating the proposed act or the rules framed under it.
Will the proposed legislation impact independent journalists and common citizens?
The legislation proposes to bring not just independent journalists but also individuals sharing news and information on digital platforms under the regulatory framework by prescribing that those individuals who broadcast news and current affairs programmes through digital means, excluding publishers of newspapers and replica e-papers of such newspapers, must adhere to the Programme and the Advertisement Code.
The definition of news in the law is identical to the one in IT Rules 2021, and legal experts have described it as ambiguous and broad. News has been defined as newly received or noteworthy audio, visual, or audio-visual programs or live programs, including analysis, about recent events primarily of a socio-political, economic, or cultural nature, or any programs transmitted or retransmitted on a broadcasting network, where the context, purpose, import, and meaning imply so.
However, experts have noted that the Bombay and Madras High Courts had stayed sections 9(1) and 9(3) of the IT Rules 2021, which require news and current affairs platforms to follow the Code of Ethics and establish a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism. Also, the existing programme code under the present CTN Act is already included in the Code of Ethics.

Sony-Zee merger risks collapse ahead of deadline over CEO drama,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-zee-merger-risks-collapse-ahead-of-deadline-over-ceo-drama/articleshow/105552378.cms,28-11-2023,"The fate of the planned merger between Sony Group Corp.’s India unit and
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
. may be known as early as next week, according to people familiar with the matter, as the companies face a looming deadline to resolve their standoff or scuttle a long-awaited deal to create a $10 billion media giant.
Unless the two sides can agree on who’ll lead the merged entity and give the final touches to the merger, Sony is likely to send a letter next week to Zee saying the stipulated demands for the merger couldn’t be met, said the people, who asked not to be named as the information isn’t public. That could be the death knell for the deal since there won’t be enough time to tie all the loose ends by the formal Dec. 21 deadline, the people said.

Zee is insisting that its Chief Executive Officer Punit Goenka
— also its founder’s son — will helm the new entity, as agreed in the pact signed in 2021, while Sony is wary of his appointment given a regulatory probe against Goenka, the people added. This has created an eleventh-hour tussle in the two-year-old merger plan that has already seen a fair share of drama and delays.
A Zee representative, without commenting on the leadership issue, said in an emailed response that the company was “actively engaged” toward the timely completion of all prerequisites for the deal. Zee had already completed most of them and was in touch with Sony “on a regular basis,” he said. Sony’s representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Sony, Zee will conclude merger, won't let top job become a dealbreaker: Experts
The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, alleged in June that the Mumbai-based media house faked the recovery of loans to cover private financing deals by its founder,
Subhash Chandra
. Chandra and his son, Goenka, “abused their position” and siphoned off funds, Sebi said in an interim order.
While Goenka got a reprieve from an appellate authority against the Sebi order — it had barred him from being an executive or director position in a listed company — Sony still views the ongoing probe as an overhanging corporate governance issue, the people said. Local newspaper Mint first reported this impasse.
Who Blinks First
The last-lap tussle is pushing the merger to the brink of collapse unless one of the partners blinks. The Sony-Zee deal sought to create India’s biggest entertainment company with the financial muscle to challenge global powerhouses, including Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., as well as local conglomerates such as
Reliance Industries Ltd
.
Sony will own a 50.86% stake in the merged entity and Goenka’s family will own 3.99% if the deal goes through, with public shareholders in possession of the remaining stake, according to the 2021 agreement. Sony is not considering an extension of the Dec. 21 deadline, the people said.
To be sure, the proposed merger has received almost all regulatory approvals and can still be closed if the two sides expeditiously resolve their issues. They can also request India’s company court for extending the merger deadline.
If closed, the transaction will help expand Sony’s media business in the world’s most populous country, with over 75 television channels and a market share of 37%, ahead of Disney-owned Star’s 24%, according to a note from brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
Consolidation is already heating up in the sector with Reliance, which tried to buy out Zee earlier, in advanced talks to buyout Walt Disney Co.’s India operations, Bloomberg News reported last month.

ZEEL spends ₹176 cr on merger-related expenses,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zeel-spends-176-cr-on-merger-related-expenses/articleshow/105541219.cms,28-11-2023,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises (
ZEEL
), which has signed an agreement to merge its operations with
Culver Max Entertainment
(
Sony Pictures Networks India
), has spent Rs 176.2 crore on merger-related expenses in FY23, the company's regulatory filings show.
In the previous fiscal year, merger-related expenses stood at Rs 7.3 crore. The two companies had signed definitive agreements to merge their businesses in December 2021.
The merger agreement, which has received all the requisite regulatory approvals, is stuck due to Sony's insistence on having its own executive SPNI MD & CEO, NP Singh, as the CEO of the proposed Sony-Zee joint entity since Punit Goenka, who is currently the MD & CEO of ZEEL, is still under investigation from the Securities Exchange Board of India (
Sebi
).
Goenka was slated to be the merged entity's MD & CEO.
The merger agreement has received approvals from stock exchanges, the Competition Commission of India, and the National Company Law Tribunal.

"DTH industry revenue falls 10% to Rs 11,000 crore in FY23",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/dth-industry-revenue-falls-10-to-rs-11000-crore-in-fy23/articleshow/105432390.cms,23-11-2023,"The combined operating revenue of the four private direct-to-home (DTH) companies—Tata Play, Bharti Airtel-owned Bharti Telemedia,
Dish TV
, and Sun Direct—declined nearly 10% to Rs 11,072 crore in FY23, compared to Rs 12,284 crore the previous fiscal year, according to data obtained from the four firms' regulatory filings.
Furthermore, the four DTH companies have incurred a net loss of Rs 2143 crore cumulatively, with
Dish
TV posting the biggest loss of Rs 1684 crore. All four DTH operators recorded losses in FY23, while three of the four DTH operators—aside from Dish TV—reported profits in FY22.
However, Dish TV’s losses in both FY23 and FY22 were due to exceptional items amounting to Rs 1,908 crore in FY23 and Rs 2,654 crore in FY22, the company said in a statement.
It added that the exceptional items were due to the impairment of intangible assets under development, trademarks or brands, property, plant equipment (PPE), and goodwill related to its merger with Videocon D2H and related accounting.
Experts say that the DTH business is under stress due to a decline in the subscriber base and the average revenue per user (ARPU). In FY22 and FY23, the paid DTH operators lost over four million customers.
Live Events
The experts further state that the top end of the DTH subscriber base is switching to over-the-top (OTT), while the bottom end is migrating to DD Free Dish. However, it’s DD Free Dish that has harmed the paid DTH operators more than the OTTs.
""The DTH segment has been losing most of its subscribers to DD Free Dish, while capital challenges hinder investment in new hybrid TV solutions. To thrive, the industry must prioritise investing in and upselling subscribers to HD and hybrid TV subscriptions, expanding ARPU, and retaining high-value customers,” said Mihir Shah, Vice President, Media Partners Asia.
During the Q2 FY24 earnings call,
Bharti Airtel
MD & CEO Gopal Vittal stated that the company's DTH business, although losing 1.69 lakh users during the quarter, had entered September with increasing momentum.
He also stated that the price increase implemented during the quarter was the primary driver of DTH revenue growth.
“Having said that, we continue to gain market share, and this is driven by our focus on quality acquisitions and simplified pricing. Our market-specific strategy to address the challenges of DTH has started to show some green shoots in Maharashtra and Gujarat,” Vittal noted.
The active pay DTH subscriber base stood at 65.25 million as of March 31, according to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) data. While there is no official data on DD Free Dish's customer base, observers say the Prasar Bharati-owned free DTH platform covers 40–50 million TV households.
A Dish TV India spokesperson said that DD Free Dish and OTT have impacted every DTH operator to varying degrees, depending on the strength of each player in individual geographies.
“Dish TV India has acted with agility and has diversified itself into the emerging OTT business as well. The company has been leveraging digital opportunities and is optimistic about ramping up subscriptions from the OTT business in FY24,” the spokesperson added.
DTH operators such as
Tata Play
, Dish TV, and Airtel Digital TV have also responded to OTT platform competition by launching hybrid STBs that offer both linear TV and OTT content, as well as OTT aggregation services that provide consumers with the convenience of single billing and a unified interface.
Tata Play has launched
Tata Play Binge
, while Dish TV and Airtel Digital TV have Watcho and Airtel XStream, respectively.
Dish TV, which has become net debt-free, intends to use the cash flows towards capital expenditure in acquiring new customers. In Q2 FY24, the DTH operator had 1 million gross additions.

Despite a challenging 2023, the Wavemaker chief is projecting the Indian advertising market to grow by 14% in 2024. He also believes that Wavemaker India will outstrip industry growth.
""Globally, Wavemaker has grown, and the broader business has grown over 25% in those same periods. And the bottom line has grown by over a third. So, India is outperforming the global averages, but the global averages are very strong as well,"" he noted.
Jenner said that the Indian market is attractive for global companies like Wavemaker due to its huge population.
He cited the example of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final match between India and Australia, which he said was watched by close to half a billion people on both TV and digital.
""Global streaming platforms like Netflix,
Prime Video
, Hulu, and Paramount+ would die for that type of audience,"" the Wavemaker CEO said.
According to global research firm COMvergence, global media ad spending stood at $401 billion in 2022, with the big six advertising holding groups, including
WPP
, Publicis, Interpublic Group, Dentsu, Omnicom, and Havas, managing $213 billion of that amount.
""WPP represents about a third of every dollar that's invested worldwide, and Wavemaker is probably about a third of the media spends managed by WPP,"" he stated.

India-Australia match: Disney+ Hotstar sees record 59 million concurrent viewers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/india-australia-match-disney-hotstar-sees-record-59-million-concurrent-viewers/articleshow/105336689.cms,20-11-2023,"Disney+ Hotstar set a new peak concurrent user record of 59 million during the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final between India and Australia on Sunday, breaking the previous record of 53 million during the semi-final match between India and New Zealand on November 15.
The platform, which is streaming the tournament for free to all mobile users, has been setting new peak concurrency records during the tournament. Buoyed by the response, the platform will also stream the upcoming Pro Kabaddi League for free to all mobile users.
During the India vs South Africa match on November 5, the platform attracted 44 million peak concurrent users. Prior to that, India's matches against New Zealand and Pakistan had peak concurrent users of 43 million and 35 million, respectively.
Earlier, JioCinema had set a streaming record with the Indian
Premier
League (IPL) 2023 final match between the Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings drawing 32 million concurrent users. JioCinema had streamed the IPL free to all internet users. Media experts have opined that the growth in digital viewership is on account of free streaming coupled with growing smartphone penetration and mobile data usage. While the peak concurrency on digital has seen a surge, Broadcast Audience Research Council (
BARC
) data for the All India 2+ audience suggests that the India vs New Zealand match on October 22 had 80 million peak concurrent viewers on TV across Disney Star channels and Doordarshan.

Formerly known as TV18 Home Shopping Network, Television Home Shopping Network operates TV home shopping channels and an ecommerce marketplace under the brand name HomeShop18.
In 2019, real estate firm
Skyblue Buildwell
acquired a controlling stake in HomeShop18 from Network18, which owned TV18 Home Shopping Network.
The tribunal noted that the approval of the resolution plan must not be construed as a waiver of any statutory obligations of Television Home Shopping Network.
There had been total claims of Rs 397 crore against the company. Of this, claims of Rs 16.56 crore had been admitted. Secured financial creditors had claimed dues of Rs 19.65 crore, while operational creditors (government dues) amounted to about Rs 377 crore.
The process for corporate insolvency resolution was initiated against the company on an application by cable TV distribution company
Siti Networks
, which had claimed dues of Rs 43.68 lakh along with an 18% interest.
Siti's petition was admitted by the NCLT on March 3 this year. Treasure Retail's petition claiming dues of Rs 1.38 crore against the company was also admitted by the tribunal on May 12.
The latest NCLT order came on an application filed by the company’s resolution professional, Darshan Patel, seeking approval for the sole resolution plan submitted by Globlin India and Khandwala Finstock on August 4.
The NCLT has directed Goblin and Khandwala Finstock to approach appropriate forums separately for the reliefs, waivers and concessions/approvals sought in the resolution plan.
The tribunal said claims that were not part of the resolution plan would stand extinguished.

FanCode holds exclusive rights and partnerships with various entities, including ICC Pathways, Cricket West Indies, EFL, CONMEBOL, Volleyball World, and FIBA. Subscribers can tune in to tournaments such as the Carabao Cup, Women’s Big Bash League, FIFA U17 World Cup, Barclays Women’s Super League, AFC Champions League, AFC Cup, and Yuva Kabaddi, among others.
Furthermore, subscribers will also have access to upcoming events like the Super Smash and the England tour of the West Indies scheduled for later in the year.
""The addition of FanCode to Prime Video Channels also allows us to offer a comprehensive bouquet of entertainment, from international and local language content to kids-focused and now live sports,"" said Vivek Srivastava, head – Prime Video Channels, Prime Video, India.
Amazon's partnership with FanCode follows a high-stakes showdown between Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani and Disney Star over media rights for the Indian Premier League last year. This resulted in Disney Star securing television rights while Ambani acquired digital rights for the world's second-wealthiest league. Additionally, Ambani has clinched media rights for all of India's domestic cricket matches, outbidding Sony, which is reportedly days away from closing potential merger with Zee to form a new $10 billion media giant.
In fact, there were reports that India's cricket regulatory body had made efforts to attract global giants Amazon and Alphabet to participate in a media rights auction for its team's matches. Meanwhile, reports also say
Reliance
is ahead in a race to buy Disney Star's India assets, signaling a shift in market dynamics and creating an opportunity for new contenders to vie for sports viewership in the world's most populous country.
There were also reports earlier that Amazon was in talks with Walt Disney Co about picking up a minority stake in the ESPN streaming service being developed by the Disney+ owner.
""FanCode wants to reach every sports fan across the country and this association with Prime Video is a step in that direction,"" said Yannick Colaco, co-founder, FanCode. We are excited to bring our premium content to Prime Video Channels and further increase our reach. The fact that FanCode will be the first sports platform on the service makes the collaboration even more special.""
Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara, said the partnership definitely adds one more player in terms of
sports streaming
, but Amazon will not immediately create an impact as ICC rights, BCCI bilateral series and IPL rights are with Star and Reliance.
However, there is a big gap in non-cricket games and that is where Amazon can cash in on.
""I think what they can do is they are trying to focus on non-cricket sports such as hockey, basketball rugby. It's a very fragmented market beyond cricket,"" Taurani said.

merger
of
Sony
Group Corporation's India media division, Culver Max Entertainment, also known as Sony Pictures Networks India, and Punit Goenka-led
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
Limited (
ZEEL
) to proceed despite disagreements over the position of CEO of the proposed combined company as the contractual drop off date of December 20 approaches closer.
Abhijit Joshi, managing partner of law firm
Veritas
Legal said a scheme, once approved by all the authorities, should typically proceed subject to the conditionalities as per the scheme.
“Typically, there is a lag between the approval from the court or tribunal and the effectiveness of the scheme. The scope of withdrawal will be limited and will depend on conditionalities to its effectiveness under the provisions of the scheme itself,” he explained.
As reported by ET, Sony has requested that Goenka let go of the position of MD and CEO of the merged entity till he gets cleared by
Sebi
, which is probing him for alleged misappropriation of company funds.
While Sony is also looking to appoint its own executive, SPNI MD & CEO NP Singh, as the CEO of the merged entity, Goenka believes that the Securities Appellate Tribunal’s (
SAT
) verdict setting aside the Sebi order banning him from holding the top executive position has cleared the way for him to become the MD and CEO of the Sony-Zee combined entity.

Three Likely Outcomes
While setting aside the Sebi order, the SAT allowed the market watchdog to complete its probe against Goenka and his father Subhash Chandra in eight months and take relevant action as per the legal process.
Though he stated that Sony and Zee had gone too far with the merger to turn back now, lawyer Abhishek Malhotra listed three potential outcomes as the two parties worked out a solution to complete the merger.
He said the first scenario is that both parties decide that the cut-off date to complete the merger is approaching, so it's important to go ahead with the merger with a CEO from Sony until Goenka gets cleared of charges by Sebi.
“While the Sebi probe is on, someone from Sony might become the CEO of the merged entity, and the CFO might be from Zee. They can take this arrangement forward and change it back to the original understanding as soon as Punit gets the clean chit,” Malhotra said.
In an interview with ET in June, ZEEL MD & CEO Punit Goenka stated that the merger's current contractual end date is December 20, 2023. He also claimed that the merger would take place whether he was the CEO or not.
According to Malhotra, the second scenario could be that Punit will nominate someone else from Zee as the CEO of the merged entity.
“In the third scenario, Punit might say that there's no impediment to him being the MD & CEO since there is a stay currently on the Sebi order. He might argue that the Sebi probe could last longer than eight months, so let him be the MD & CEO, and the probe can continue,” he stated.
Sudip Mahapatra, partner at S&R Associates, also believes that Sony and Zee will resolve their differences and implement the merger relatively soon since they will not want to miss out on the opportunity to build a large-scale business at a time when the media & entertainment industry is getting consolidated.
The Sony-Zee merger has received key legal and regulatory approvals to give effect to the merger.
The next step is getting the ministry of information and broadcasting’s (MIB) approval since there is a change in shareholding pattern and filing the NCLT order granting approval to the merger scheme of arrangement with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).
While stating that the SAT has set aside the Sebi order banning Goenka from holding directorship or a top management role, Mahapatra thinks there is a possibility that the matter will reach the Supreme Court since Sebi is mulling a challenge to the SAT verdict before the apex court. Goenka has reportedly filed a caveat before the Supreme Court in anticipation of Sebi's move.
Mohapatra believes that if Goenka is appointed MD and CEO of the merged entity while the matter is still being litigated in the Supreme Court, it will add considerable uncertainty to the overall governance of the company.
“Sony has global stakeholders scrutinising its corporate actions. It may find it hard to justify such an appointment until the matter is fully resolved,” said Mahapatra.
“Given the circumstances, Sony seems to have made a reasonable proposal that its nominee become the CEO. Parties should proceed with this option until the litigation surrounding Goenka is fully resolved.”
Sony and Zee signed a merger agreement in December 2021. The deal was anticipated to conclude in 8-10 months. However, two years down the line, it is yet to be completed due to the cases filed by financial institutions against ZEEL and the Sebi order against the company’s promoters.
Once completed, the merger will lead to the creation of a multibillion-dollar media powerhouse with a leading position in TV, OTT, and content creation. The FY23 financials show that ZEEL and Sony's combined revenue was almost Rs 15,000 crore.
After the merger, Sony would indirectly own 50.86% of the new company, while other ZEEL shareholders would hold a 45.15 percent stake and the ZEEL founders would hold 3.99%. The merged entity will get a fund infusion of $1.5 billion from Sony.

over some differences,” says the marketing professional from Mumbai. Unable to approach Ramu via any other digital platform, her friend finally reached out to her on the Google-owned mobile payments
app
, asking to reconcile. GPay isn’t typically seen as a communication tool so it hadn’t occurred to Ramu to block her friend there as well. She was amused by her friend’s ingenuity and moved by their effort to reconnect.
On another occasion, she used GPay’s
chat
interface to communicate with a fellow passenger she had met on a flight. “I had lost my wallet in the airport and they lent me some cash, which I promptly returned via the app.” Later, she messaged them on GPay to share that the airport authorities had found her wallet. Who would have thought that an app focused on transactions could mend and forge human connections?
Besides using GPay as an unintentional chat app, Ramu also uses Pinterest’s messaging feature to share and discuss images she likes on the visual bookmarking site. “Wherever there is shareable content, having a messaging interface helps to have seamless conversations without leaving the platform,” she says.
WhatsApp is the undisputed leader of messaging apps, with over 535 million monthly active users in India, and more than 2.7 billion worldwide. Lately, though, instead of relying on WhatsApp alone, people are using all kinds of apps that have a chatting interface for some form of communication, even though that’s not the platform’s primary offering. This trend signifies a shift from calling to texting culture, compelling internet platforms and brands to prioritise enhancing their messaging interfaces, all the while raising questions on the future of digital messaging.
WHAT’S UP WITH WHATSAPP?
The shift has happened partly because WhatsApp has stopped being the perfect messaging app it once was. Meta, its parent company, has been pushing businesses to onboard its ad solutions platform, WhatsApp Business, to monetise the app that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg bought for $19 billion in 2014.

In Q1 2023, paid messaging [by businesses] on WhatsApp grew by 40% quarter-on-quarter, Zuckerberg said in an earnings call in April. By June, WhatsApp Business reached 200 million monthly active users worldwide. In India, “businesses send 6 to 60 lakh messages to users in a day,” says an executive at an analytical company that tracks the platform’s business performance. “Some international companies have started sending OTPs (one-time-passwords) on WhatsApp as well, as it costs them one-third the price of sending OTPs via SMSes,” says the executive quoted above who wishes to remain anonymous.
WhatsApp’s usage has fallen. The average time a user spends on it has g one down from 19 hours a month in 2020 to 18.6 in 2021 to 17.3 in 2022, as per global data on Verloop.io, a customer support automation platform, and analytics site datareportal.com. But they do not pin this fall on spamming messages. Verloop attributes it to“mobile usage patterns moderating following the abrupt surge seen during the pandemic”.
The open rate for business messages on WhatsApp has also fallen from 94% to 83% in the last two years, says the anonymous executive at the analytics company. Open rate is the share of recipients who open a message out of the total recipients it is sent to. However, a Meta spokesperson says in an emailed response to ET that the opening rates mentioned are still “well above standards for the industry and would be considered highly successful”. “We continue to see the growth of people engaging with businesses in India. Last earnings, Zuckerberg noted that every week, more than 60% people on WhatsApp in India message a business app account. Daily conversations between people and businesses more than doubled in India since last year,” the spokesperson adds.
Users express certain concerns. “WhatsApp feels like a chaotic blend of various elements, with everyone from your family, friend circle and work life interacting with you via the same app,” says Kashvi Parekh, 21, a community lead at World of Women, a digital membership club for art, tech and culture based on blockchain. “My communication landscape comprises 60%
Instagram
DMs (direct messages),” she adds. “I like that I can sort my conversations into Primary and General categories on Insta.” She even uses the messaging interface of Life360, a live-location sharing app, to keep track of her family’s whereabouts. “It makes it easier to chat by offering prompts like ‘ETA’, ‘What’s up?’, etc.”
HEARTING INSTA DM
Ankit Kumar, 25, a growth consultant from Bengaluru, finds Instagram DMs convenient to keep in touch with people: “I can connect with friends just by sharing memes and reacting to the ones they sent.” He prefers Instagram and Twitter to make new connections as they eliminate the need for phone numbers. “It’s easier to ask for someone’s social media handle,” he adds. Conversations via WhatsApp tend to be more intentional than in ot her apps, says Shaheena Attarwala, a product designer. “On WhatsApp, you need to make that decision to message someone and often there is an awkward start to it. On platforms like Instagram, you can break the ice with people who might not even be in your inner circle by just liking or commenting on their posts.” WhatsApp is a pure-play communication tool, whereas unintentional messaging apps like Instagram add nudges to conversations and help one reconnect organically, she adds.
Further, people expect realtime responses on WhatsApp because work often spills into that inbox. Nikhil Taneja recently updated his WhatsApp status to inform his contacts that he is not very active on the app anymore. “I wrote it because due to work messages and spam, I was missing out on some of my friends’ messages there. People feel entitled to your time on WhatsApp and label you as rude if you don’t reply as soon as you have seen the message. I believe we should have the power to choose when we reply,” says Taneja, cofounder of Yuvaa, a platform for youth. He has made Insta his main chat app as asynchronous communication is the expected norm there.
“On Instagram, the role of DMs has evolved,” a Meta spokesperson tells ET on email. “While it continues to be a space for transparent, honest and direct communication, it is also now a space for larger friends’ groups, and for connecting with brands.”
Earlier this year, Instagram introduced ‘Quiet mode,’ which disables notifications and notifies senders that the recipient hasn’t been informed about their DM. The app also enables you to send messages without notifying friends late at night or when they are busy, by adding “@silent” in the message. In July, Instagram’s head, Adam
Mosseri, said on the 20VC podcast that teens favour DMs over stories and the feed. In response, he redirected resources to develop messaging tools, even transitioning the Instagram Stories team to focus on DMs.
PLATFORM PUSH
X, formerly Twitter, has added multiple reaction emojis and the ability to reply to specific messages within an ongoing chat in DMs even as it has restricted the ability of non-premium users to DM anyone. Instagram DMs offer playback speed controls for voice notes. Instagram and WhatsApp both allow disappearing messages. WhatsApp is also reportedly working on launching a feature called Alternate Profile’ that will allow users to separate their personal and professional avatars on the app.
“While social media platforms are working harder towards making their chat experiences superior to the competition, the rest of the companies are trying to leverage their own offerings as a feature through chat,” says Prasanna Venkatesh, director of design at a consumer internet company in Bengaluru. “Companies are realising the value of conversational experiences in the digital world.”
Now, customer care issues for certain food delivery, telecom and ecommerce apps, as well as booking confirmation for certain hyperlocal services are all accomplished through messaging interfaces. Certain airlines also handle booking changes by redirecting to a messaging app to take the transaction forward.
“Previously, these functions were reserved for customer care executives that people would call. Making these processes message-led is also cost-effective for brands,” says Abhishek Gupta, chief customer officer at CleverTap, a customer engagement platform. Gupta adds that if an app’s messaging interface has a limited use case like restricting it to riders and drivers in the case of cab-hailing services, it will limit the feature's usefulness. “To thrive, apps need to become super apps, which means they have to attract users for both transactions and connections.”
Building a smooth chat experience is challenging although the messaging infrastructure is available on an open-source network. A study by a software developer, Andriy Utkin, shows that Facebook Messenger still uses 5x-6x more power than WhatsApp on Android devices. The study, not without its fair share of criticisms, was widely discussed on Hacker News, a Y Combinator news website.
There are surveillance concerns, too. “If it’s not a core messaging app, it may not be obligated to ensure the privacy of your chats,” says Prateek Waghre, policy director at Internet Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for free and open internet. “If the chatting interface does not have end-to-end encryption, it means your c h a t s are open to decryption,” he adds.
Going forward, Attarwala and Venkatesh envision chat apps to become AI-led, and more visual than textual.
Now, the rise of unintentional messaging apps seems convenient. Most of them don’t require phone numbers to commence a chat. “But this will get quite complicated in future,” says Himanshu Khanna, founder of Openvy.com, a platform for people to chat and create open communities. For one, no one maintains a folder for these chats, he says. WhatsApp is still probably the only messaging app with an in-built search feature. “Soon, recalling chats across platforms will become challenging.”
Khanna also highlights that, globally, the internet consumer has moved on from social media and entered the era of “social habitats” where, instead of being active consumers of content around people in our social circle, they “coexist in digital spheres”. This is bound to get overwhelming. “Soon, whoever solves for segmenting and unifying these chats will have an edge over other players,” he adds. Anyone wants to build a UPI for chats?

"I&B Ministry proposes to bring OTT, digital news under new legislation",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ib-ministry-proposes-to-bring-ott-digital-news-under-new-legislation/articleshow/105133353.cms,11-11-2023,"The information and broadcasting ministry has solicited public comments on the
Broadcasting Services
(Regulation) Bill, 2023, which, once enacted, will replace the three-decade-old Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995 (CTN Act).
ET first reported on the ministry's plans to introduce the bill.
The bill, which is divided into six chapters, 48 sections and three schedules, aims to expedite regulatory processes, broaden its scope to include over-the-top (OTT) and
digital news
platforms, and incorporate modern definitions and provisions for emerging technologies.
While the CTN Act of 1995 applies to TV broadcasters and cable TV operators such as multi-system operators and local cable operators, the proposed law will include content platforms such as TV channels, FM radio and OTT, as well as distributors such as cable TV, direct-to-home (
DTH
), headend in the sky (HITS) and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV).
According to the draft bill, OTT broadcasting services will not include a social media intermediary or a user of such an intermediary, as specified in provisions under the
Information Technology Act
of 2000.
Live Events
The draft bill also states that barring Prasar Bharati and Sansad TV, the central and state governments, local governing bodies, public authorities and political parties are not eligible for registration as broadcasters or broadcasting network operators.
It also says these entities will have to cease operations or transfer their operations to eligible individuals, even if they are providing broadcasting services or operating a broadcasting network under authorisation from the central government. This clause will impact the Tamil Nadu and
Andhra Pradesh
governments which own and operate services such as
Arasu Cable TV Corporation
and
Andhra Pradesh State FiberNet
.
The ministry said the idea behind introducing the draft is to replace the current fragmented regulatory framework with a
comprehensive law
and to consolidate numerous broadcasting services under a single legislative framework.
The ministry has asked stakeholders and the general public to provide feedback on the proposed legislation within 30 days.
The ministry intends to establish
self-regulation
through content evaluation committees and a broadcast advisory council. It also aims to provide programme and advertisement codes for various broadcasting network providers, as well as accessible measures for people with disabilities and statutory penalties.
The proposed bill includes statutory consequences for operators and broadcasters, such as advisory, warning, censure and monetary fines. Only serious offences will result in jail time or penalties.
Monetary penalties and fines are proportional to an entity's financial capacity, taking investment and turnover into account.
The bill also includes provisions for infrastructure sharing among broadcasting network operators and the carriage of platform services.
Besides, it streamlines the Right of Way section to manage relocation and alterations more rapidly and introduces a structured dispute resolution procedure.

ICC CWC: First 34 matches reached 330 million audiences on Disney Star channels,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/icc-cwc-first-34-matches-reached-430-million-audiences-on-disney-star-channels/articleshow/105115012.cms,10-11-2023,"The audience reach of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 on
Disney Star channels
has declined 6% to 330 million compared to the previous edition of the tournament in 2019, as per Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC)
India
data.
However, the live broadcast of the tournament on both Disney Star and Doordarshan was watched by 429 million viewers until match 34 on November 3, as per data shared by the broadcaster. Matches aired on Doordarshan are available to free-to-air (FTA) audiences.
Quoting BARC data, Disney Star said total watch time for live broadcasts has risen by 10% to 243.6 billion minutes compared to 2019. The average time spent by viewers has also gone up by 18% to 568 minutes per viewer in 2023, from 482 minutes in 2019.
Disney Star noted that all the matches involving
Team India
have registered peak concurrency of more than 50 million on television, with India vs. New Zealand attaining the highest peak concurrency for the tournament at 80 million.
Commenting on the drop in TV viewership, a top official with a leading media buying agency said there has been a drastic change in the media landscape in the last four years due to the implementation of the new tariff order (NTO) in 2019 coupled with the rise of DD Free Dish and video streaming.

Post the implementation of NTO, there has been a churn in the pay-TV ecosystem with the lower end of the TV subscribers moving to DD Free Dish and the upper end migrating to streaming.
On digital, Disney+ Hotstar saw peak concurrent viewership of 44 million, 43 million, and 35 million for India's matches against South Africa, New Zealand, and Pakistan, respectively. Every top concurrent viewership figure is a record in and of itself.
The average television rating (TVR), a combination of reach and time spent, has declined 11% to 1.76
TVR
for the All India, 2+ audience.
In the core male 15+ TG for all India markets, the cumulative reach is down 11% to 134 million, while the TVR has fallen 8% to 2.25.
Between TV and digital, Disney Star is expected to earn ad revenues between Rs 2000 crore to Rs 2500 crore.
According to media buyers, Disney+ Hotstar is anticipated to contribute significantly to the entire ad revenue pool due to the increase in digital viewership, even if
Star Sports
is expected to deliver a higher proportion due to the high-ticket sizes of the sponsorship deals.

One of the key elements of the merger agreement is Goenka's appointment to the role of MD & CEO of the combined business. This has, however, led to disagreements between the two parties.
Even though Goenka has been granted a reprieve by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), Sony is worried about the regulatory ramifications of his continuing to be under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which is expected to complete its probe against ZEEL promoters in eight months.
Sony is said to have requested that Goenka make way for its India MD and CEO, N.P. Singh, to ensure that the merger and the subsequent integration between the two companies happen smoothly. However, Goenka has contended that the SAT verdict has cleared the path for him to take over as the chief of the soon-to-form
Sony-Zee
entity.
The Sony-Zee merger has received the approval of the stock exchanges, the Competition Commission of India, and the National Company Law Tribunal.
Meanwhile, ZEEL has recorded a 9% year-on-year growth in net profit at Rs 123 crore for the quarter ended September. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) expanded by 6% to Rs. 333 crore in the quarter.
Revenue jumped 21% to Rs 2,438 crore on the back of strong performances by the film and digital divisions. During the quarter, ZEEL-owned
Zee Studios
released six films, including Gadar-2, which was one of the highest-grossing Hindi films during the quarter.
Advertising revenue during the quarter fell 3% to Rs 979 crore due to a subdued ad market, while subscription revenue rose 8% to Rs 888 crore on the back of increases in TV channel prices and growth in the ZEE5 subscription business.
Total revenue of ZEE5, ZEEL's streaming platform, surged by 59% to Rs 265 crore, while operating loss narrowed by 8.3% to Rs 254 crore.

Disney would like to stay in the Indian market: Bob Iger,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-would-like-to-stay-in-the-indian-market-bob-iger/articleshow/105085814.cms,09-11-2023,"Walt
Disney
CEO Bog Iger has said that the media conglomerate would like to stay in the Indian market even as it is considering options for the
Star India
business, which is also known as
Disney Star
.
""We'd like to stay in that market. But we're also looking to see whether we can, obviously, strengthen our hand and improve the bottom line,"" Iger said in response to a question about the company's India business during the Q4 2023 earnings call.
While stating that Disney is considering various options for the India business, which comprises 77 TV channels and one streaming platform, Disney+ Hotstar, Iger added that the company has an opportunity to strengthen its hand in the market.
""We're considering our options there. We have an opportunity to strengthen our hand. It is now maybe the most populous country in the world, or maybe just still second to China and about to pass them,"" he noted.
Disney has held talks with multiple parties, including
Reliance Industries
, for the sale of its Indian assets. Media analysts say if the proposed transaction between Disney and Reliance, which owns Viacom18, goes through, it will lead to the creation of a media goliath with an estimated Rs 25,000 crore in topline.

Iger said that the company's linear business in India does quite well and throws up a lot of cash. ""But we know that other parts of that business are challenged for us and for others. And we are looking, I'll call it expensively,"" he said.
Star India's entertainment segment is profitable, while the sports and streaming segments are losing money.
During the quarter ending September 30, Disney+ Hotstar's paid subscriber base fell 7% QoQ or 2.8 million to 37.6 million. The total subscriber loss now stands at 23.8 million between October 2022 to September 2023 due to the loss of the Indian Premier League (IPL) digital rights and the non-renewal of the HBO content deal.
The platform's average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $0.59 to $0.70 due to a lower mix of wholesale subscribers and higher advertising revenue.
The company's sports business in India under
Star Sports
saw its operating profit shrink 29% YoY to $12 million while revenue fell 21% YoY to $92 million. As reported earlier, the India sports business reported an operating loss of $444 million for the nine-month period ending July 1. It earned $637 million in revenue during the period under review.
For the fiscal ended September, Walt Disney's operating profit rose 6% to $12.8 billion while revenue increased 7% to $88.8 billion. Revenue from the streaming business, including Disney+ Hotstar, increased 12% to $21.9 billion while operating loss decreased 35% to $2.6 billion.
In addition to the $5.5 billion cost reduction plan announced earlier, Disney said it would cut another $2 billion in expenses, increasing its annualised efficiency target to $7.5 billion.
The company expects total content spend in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $25 billion, which is a decrease of $2 billion versus 2023, as a result of its continued efforts to be more efficient in content spend, in addition to impacts from the strikes and the timing of sports payments.
Walt Disney-owned Star India's consolidated net profit for FY23 has dropped 31% year over year to Rs 1272 crore compared to Rs 1834 crore in the previous fiscal. While the company's operating revenue from TV and digital businesses increased by 6% to Rs 19,857 crore, its total income increased by 9% to Rs 20699 crore.

During the meeting, the industry representatives expressed their views on pressing issues such as royalty distribution, statutory licensing mainly under Section 31(d), single-window licensing, and inclusive representation on the copyright society's board.
While giving a patient hearing to stakeholders from the music industry, Goyal emphasised the need to respect the fair and equitable distribution of royalty as per the terms decided.
Issues related to extension of statutory licensing on the internet were also discussed, which will be revisited after consultation with the stakeholders.
Goyal also touched upon the issue of having equitable representation in copyright societies with an inclusive approach to the representation of women and equal rights for smaller artists.
The copyright societies have been asked to resolve the disputes collectively. There are multiple registered copyright societies that manage and protect the literary and creative work of artists.
It was also discussed at the meeting that the copyright societies will review their articles of association and discuss all such issues in a common forum.
The minister has formed a committee chaired by Anoop Jalota, with representation from all relevant copyright societies to discuss issues related to the creative industry. The committee will submit a report with solutions within 30 days.

Netflix is still growing its subscriber base – here's how a local approach is helping,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/netflix-is-still-growing-its-subscriber-base-heres-how-a-local-approach-is-helping/articleshow/104959365.cms,04-11-2023,"Netflix
had a tough year in 2022. Big rivals such as
Disney
and
Amazon Prime
were circling, and viewers seemed to be rethinking their
streaming
habits amid rising prices in a turbulent global economy. Netflix lost subscribers, and its share value plummeted.
Since then though, the company appears to have enjoyed a very swift reboot.
According to its latest letter to shareholders, it added 8.8 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2023, on top of the 5.9 million it gained in the three months before that. The total number of subscribers worldwide is now 247.2 million.
So how has Netflix managed to turn things around?
One vital element was the crackdown on people sharing accounts across different households. By restricting the use of a single password to family members living in the same household, Netflix has successfully converted some of the password borrowers into bona fide members.

Another key move was resorting to that trusted old means of media revenue – advertising. Netflix's launch of a membership option in which subscribers pay a lower monthly fee to watch content that includes occasional adverts has proven popular. Around 30% of new members now sign up to it – an encouraging rate for Netflix executives who are planning to scale it up.
But as well as these two fairly recent initiatives, what really allows Netflix to thrive in such a competitive market place is its solid understanding of the global nature of the streaming industry, which I describe in my recent book.
The company's international approach is reflected in the fact that more than 70% of its subscribers come from outside of the US. It produces or co-produces shows in more than 50 countries, and has invested heavily in content from countries such as South Korea (USD 2.5 billion (£2.05 billion) in the next four years) and the UK (USD 6 billion since 2020).
This local investment attracts local subscribers, as has been the case with Sintonia in Brazil, Dear Child in Germany and and Class Act in France.
But the regional investment also brings global returns. A recent audience study found that a sizeable number of viewers seek out foreign content on streaming platforms. Some of Netflix's foreign language series have proved to be extremely popular abroad, including
Lupin
(made in France) and Money Heist (Spain).
South Korean drama – including All of Us Are Dead, The Glory and Squid Game – have travelled particularly well, which may explain the extra investment Netflix is making there.
And all of this content is bolstered by US productions and Hollywood films which remain popular across borders. Grant Singer's Reptile and Chloe Domont's Fair Play were in Netflix's top 10 films in 88 and 91 countries respectively in October.
Showtime
On the technical side, it is sometimes claimed that Netflix epitomises a “vertical integration model”, operating across the entire chain of TV content production and distribution. But in reality it is great at outsourcing.
For while Netflix has its own engineers and proprietary technology, including its famed recommendation system and algorithm, the company has designed its entire media delivery on third-party service infrastructure.
Netflix shut its last data centre in 2016. Now everything the platform needs, from data storage to customer information and algorithms runs on Amazon's web services.
Outsourcing media delivery has enabled Netflix to avoid sinking cash in to global infrastructure, and instead focus on its core mission: members' engagement across markets.
The same goes with content production. Netflix “originals” are produced by the platform insofar has it pays for the entirety of the production costs. But the content is actually made by outside film and TV producers.
This entails governing a vast network of suppliers, giving it extraordinary flexibility in a fast moving industry. In contrast, the likes of Disney+ have to rely more heavily on a limited range of production it is directly responsible for making.
If Netflix does have a corporate weakness, it may be that its streaming service is not part of a large enterprise ecosystem. Amazon and Apple for example, sell goods to millions of customers and cleverly entwine different parts of their empires to deliver significant economies of scale.
Despite this, Netflix's approach embraces the challenges and opportunities a global market offers. Its outsourcing model makes it agile and able to pivot rapidly with a business model which enables it to thrive.
The streaming industry – and television at large – is entering a period of adjustment because it needs to close the gap between content investment and revenue generation. Aided by some shrewd decisions and with a truly global outlook, the market leader appears to be in a good position to weather the storm.

Sony wants its own executive as head of merged company instead of Zee's Punit Goenka,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sony-wants-own-executive-as-head-of-merged-company-instead-of-zees-punit-goenka/articleshow/104955267.cms,04-11-2023,"Mumbai:
Zee Entertainment
Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) chief
Punit Goenka
's position as MD and CEO of the proposed Sony-Zee merged entity is on shaky ground as he continues to be under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the alleged diversion of funds from
ZEEL
to promoter entities, people aware of the development told ET.
Sony Group Corp
, especially sensitive to this shadow over the deal given the stringent corporate governance norms in Japan and the US, is said to be pushing for its longstanding India executive, NP Singh, to become the CEO of the merged entity. Goenka is still the subject of a Sebi investigation, despite the recent relief granted by the
Securities Appellate Tribunal
(SAT).
While Goenka has received interim relief from the SAT, the order states that he will have to cooperate with Sebi in the probe. SAT has also said in its order that if any evidence is discovered against Goenka, Sebi may follow the legal process and take relevant action.
The development has significant implications for the merger agreement between ZEEL and Culver Max Entertainment, the Indian media division of Sony Group Corp, since Goenka's nomination as MD and CEO of the merged entity was a necessary condition for the merger.
Tony Vinciquerra, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Ravi Ahuja, chairman of Sony Pictures' Global Television Studios and Corporate Development, and Goenka have held talks to find a way out.

However, the two sides have not made any progress on this thorny issue.
According to a person familiar with the situation, Goenka has made it clear to Sony's brass that he wants to be the MD and CEO of Sony-Zee, particularly after the SAT verdict overturned Sebi's regulatory ban. This had barred him from holding a directorship or a top managerial role in a listed entity, including the proposed Sony-Zee combine.
In June, Sony's subsidiary Sony Pictures Entertainment issued a statement saying that it takes Sebi's order against ZEEL promoters very seriously and will continue to monitor developments that may affect the deal.
""We do not comment on speculation and hence cannot offer a comment,"" a ZEEL spokesperson said. Sony declined to comment.
While Goenka stated earlier that the merger would go through whether he is the CEO or not, particularly since it benefits 96% of stakeholders, sources said he will use the SAT's favourable order to push his case.
""It is imperative that Sony and
Zee
amicably resolve this issue since there is a lot riding on the merger between the two firms,"" said Nitin Menon, managing partner, NV Capital. ""The Sony-Zee merger will not just unlock value for the shareholders of the two companies but also for the media and entertainment ecosystem.""
Merger Delayed
The Sony-Zee merger, which was agreed in December 2021, has taken longer than expected to complete because of the legal and regulatory issues that the promoters of ZEEL are facing.
The merger was to be completed originally in eight to 10 months.

The combined entity will own 115 TV channels (Star India – 77 and Viacom18 – 38) and two strong streaming platforms—Disney+ Hotstar and Jio Cinema—if the deal fructifies. The combined entity will have over 2 lakh hours of content library.
While Walt Disney is in talks with multiple parties, including Reliance, sources indicate that the deal will take some time to materialise given the complexities involved, including the valuation of
Star
India, which is also known as Disney Star.
Disney is looking at multiple options for its India business, including the complete sale of its TV and streaming assets besides a strategic partnership.
Reliance owns a majority stake in Viacom18, which also has Uday Shankar and James Murdoch's Bodhi Tree and Paramount Global as shareholders.

""If the deal between Reliance Industries and Walt Disney goes through, it will lead to consolidation in the industry from four national media players to two strong players, Star-Viacom 18 and Sony-Zee,"" said
Kurate Digital Consulting
Senior Partner Uday Sodhi.
""The media and broadcasting sectors will become a duopoly, which will help these companies ward off the impact of a decline in the pay-TV base,"" he added.
ET Bureau
It’s a step closer to the consolidation of the media sector, which many experts say is imminent now.
Vivek Menon, managing partner at NV Capital, believes that consolidation was bound to happen in the traditional broadcasting space due to the rise of streaming.
""The dizzying growth of various OTT platforms over the last couple of years, especially post-COVID, was a clear indication of consolidation in the linear industry. If Reliance goes ahead with the Disney deal, it would be a case of duopoly, with Star/Viacom18 and Zee/Sony on one side, and smaller regional players on the other side,"" he added.
Reliance-Disney could potentially be one of the biggest deals in the Indian M&E industry, which stood at Rs 2.1 lakh crore in 2022 and is expected to reach a market size of Rs 2.34 lakh crore in 2023 at 11.5% growth, according to the FICCI-EY report.
Star-Viacom18 will enjoy a huge advantage in two of the biggest segments in the Indian M&E market—TV and digital—thanks to their over 40% share—Star (30%+) and Viacom18 (10+%)—of the TV broadcast market and their near dominance of the digital video streaming market (with Disney+ Hotstar & Jio Cinema), eclipsing global giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, who are yet to build scalable streaming businesses in the Indian market.
The deal, if it happens, will also lead to major overlaps between Star India and Viacom18 in certain segments, like Hindi general entertainment, kids, and certain regional markets.
According to Broadcast Audience Research Council data, the combined TV viewership share of Star Plus and Colors hovered between 40% and 50% in the last three months. In the Kannada market, the viewership shares of Colors Kannada and Star Suvarna ranged between 40% and 48%. The combined shares of Star Pravah and Colors Marathi would be upwards of 60%.
Legal experts believe that Star and Viacom18's large market share in certain genres could attract the attention of the competition watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI), which had given conditional approval to the merger deal between Culver Max Entertainment (
Sony
) and
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
(ZEEL).
""The proposed combination between the entities controlling Disney Star and Viacom18, while there is a difference of opinion with regard to the valuation of the proposed transaction, certainly does breach the threshold provided under Section 5 of the Competition Act 2002. In view of the fact that it breaches the threshold prescribed under the Act, the proposed combination will have to be subjected to an approval process by the CCI,"" said TMT Law Practice Managing Partner Abhishek Malhotra.
""In the process of evaluating whether or not to permit such a combination to be consummated, the CCI shall look into the market share of the combined entity and also as to whether or not such a proposed combination, if it were to be allowed, would have an appreciable adverse effect on competition.""
As of today, Sony-Zee is the biggest merger deal in the works in the M&E industry. In that deal too, the CCI ordered Sony-Zee to sell three channels in October 2022 to allay concerns about the merger's possible effects on the competitive landscape.
These included Hindi GEC Big Magic besides Zee Action, and Zee Classic, which are movie channels.
The combined spread of channels will cover multiple lucrative genres and language markets. For example, Star India has a strong presence in Hindi GEC, Hindi movies, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Marathi, and Bengali markets, whereas Viacom18 is a significant player in Hindi GEC, kids, and youth entertainment with a weak presence in regional markets, excluding Kannada.
In terms of top line, the Star-Viacom18 combo with combined revenues of Rs 25,000 crore in FY23, will be much bigger than the Sony-Zee combined entity, which had a topline of close to Rs 15,000 crore in FY23.
The Star-Viacom18 combo will have economies of scale, which will give it an upper hand when it comes to dealing not just with advertisers but also with content distributors like Airtel, Tata Play, Dish TV, and Hathway Digital.
The combined entity will be a strong force in entertainment and sports on both linear and digital, with powerful Hindi general entertainment channels like Star Plus and Colors coupled with a near monopoly in sports through properties like IPL, ICC digital rights, BCCI, Cricket Australia, Cricket South Africa,
Premier League
, LaLiga, and Olympics 2024.
Apart from the benefits on the revenue side, the combination also stands to benefit from lower content production, marketing, and distribution expenses.
""Star-Viacom18 will have a clear advantage as the combined entity will become a behemoth in both the TV and streaming business. The combined entity will enjoy economies of scale, which will allow it to dial up monetization on both the ad and subscription sides. It will also get a big boost in streaming with Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema,"" Sodhi added.

IBDF re-elects Disney Star chief K Madhavan as president for third time,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ibdf-re-elects-disney-star-chief-k-madhavan-as-president-for-third-time/articleshow/104878245.cms,01-11-2023,"The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF) has re-elected
Disney Star
President and Country Manager K Madhavan as its president for the third consecutive time. The IBDF held its 24th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Delhi on October 31, 2023.
Network18 MD Rahul Joshi and India TV chairman Rajat Sharma have been re-elected as vice presidents for Government & Regulatory Affairs and News & Current Affairs, respectively.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
President - Content & International Markets Punit Misra, has been re-elected as the
Treasurer
. Viacom18 CEO of TV and Digital for regional business and Kairali TV MD John Brittas have been co-opted to the IBDF board.
K Madhavan (Disney Star), Punit Misra (Zee), I. Venkat (Eenadu TV), Rajat Sharma (India TV), and Rahul Joshi (Network18) have also been re-elected directors to the IBDF board.
Other directors on the IBDF board include Aroon Purie (
TV Today
), NP Singh (
Sony Pictures
), Nitin Nadkarni (Sony Pictures), Punit Goenka (Zee), R. Mahesh Kumar (
Sun TV
), and Gaurav Banerjee (Disney Star).
Live Events
IBDF also hosted a lunch in honour of I&B Minister Anurag Singh Thakur, with I&B Secretary Apurva Chandra and I&B Joint Secretary (P&A) Vikram Sahay also in attendance.
Addressing the members during the AGM, IBDF President K Madhavan said, “Despite the ongoing geo-political issues like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East due to the Israel-Hamas war and accompanying economic volatility, the Indian economy in general and the media and entertainment industry, in particular, have shown extreme resilience”.
He added, “India has firmly embarked on a digital transformation journey with 868 million broadband users in India, and within a year of launch, 5G services have been rolled out across 97% of Indian cities, resulting in internet speeds going up by three times. Connected TV continues to grow, with 90% of TV sets sold in India being smart TVs. 2023 will be a defining year for the Indian M&E industry, with digital ad revenue expected to surpass ad revenue in traditional media.""
Speaking about the linear TV penetration in the country, Madhavan said, “With 900 channels, linear television continues to enjoy an unparalleled reach of 900 million viewers and is the largest media platform in India. Unlike in other developed markets, there is significant growth potential for linear TV, as one-third of households in India do not have access to television. It will require the collective might of the IBDF members to connect the left-out 100 million households to our fold.”

SEBI may move Supreme Court on SAT relief to Zee's Punit Goenka,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sebi-may-move-supreme-court-on-sat-relief-to-zees-punit-goenka/articleshow/104852099.cms,31-10-2023,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India may move Supreme Court against Securities Appellate Tribunal's recent order that lifted ban on
Zee Entertainment
's CEO
Punit Goenka
from the boardrooms of listed companies for a year.
The capital markets regulator is taking legal views on appeal against SAT order that set aside SEBI's ban on Goenka from holding directorial positions, sources told ET Now. The Zee board may also meet soon for discussing Punit Goenka's role post the SAT order, the sources added.
In an interim order, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in June restrained Essel Group Chairman Subhash Chandra Goenka and Goenka from board seats in any entity formed through the merger or amalgamation of the four Zee group companies. SEBI’s investigations showed that Chandra and Goenka abused their position as directors of Zee Entertainment in 2019 by siphoning off funds for their own benefit.
Lifting the ban on Goenka from holding the top seats in a board was seen a positive development for the Zee-Sony merger. The merger may go through at a faster clip and may not be exposed to any more delays, Karan Taurani of Elara Securities had said.
The SAT relief had paved the way for the completion of the merger between Zee Entertainment and Culver Max Entertainment (Sony Pictures India), creating a $10 billion media and entertainment powerhouse. The merger was announced in 2021 and has received requisite approvals from regulators, yet has been delayed due to legal controversies over loan defaults by a Zee group entity.
Live Events
Japan's Sony Group, of which Sony Pictures is a subsidiary, had informed its shareholders in late September that the merger, which was expected to close by the end of the first half of FY24, might be delayed.

"Zee, Sony merger energised as SAT lifts ban on Punit Goenka",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-sony-merger-energised-as-sat-lifts-ban-of-punit-goenka/articleshow/104838306.cms,31-10-2023,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (
SAT
) on Monday overturned a regulatory ban on
Punit Goenka
, managing director and chief executive of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
, that prevented him from holding a directorship or top managerial role in a listed entity.
SAT's ruling has potentially hastened the Indian media company's proposed merger with the local arm of Japan's
Sony
Group Corp - Culver Max Entertainment (Sony Pictures).
Monday's order, which now supersedes a restrictive ruling by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in August, ensures Goenka will continue to hold leadership positions in
Zee
and, in the future, as a key executive of the merged entity.
The capital markets regulator could challenge the SAT ruling in the Supreme Court.
The process to reinstate Goenka and dissolve the interim committee currently running Zee's operations has been initiated, said people close to development. Goenka and his father, Subhash Chandra, earlier failed to secure any interim relief from SAT against Sebi's order.
Live Events
SAT presiding officer Justice Tarun Agrawala and technical member Meera Swarup, setting aside the Sebi ruling, noted that the regulator has not been able to establish the ""foundational facts"" related to Goenka.
It further said in its ruling that Goenka was restrained from holding directorship and managerial positions ""on a preponderance of probabilities.
Boost for merger
SAT said it was a rejection of ""genuine documents on the ground that they do not prove the transactions beyond a reasonable doubt.""
Sebi passed an interim order on June 12, followed by a confirmatory order on August 14, against Goenka and Subhash Chandra, who is chairman emeritus at Zee, for allegedly diverting money from the company to other promoter entities without board approval.
""The withdrawal of the ban placed by Sebi on Punit Goenka - over his appointment as a key managerial person (KMP) of Zee, and merged or amalgamated entities arising from the Zee and Sony merger - will allow him to be appointed as chairman & managing editor and chief executive, as envisaged under the scheme of the merger,"" said Manmeet Kaur, partner at litigation firm Karanjawala & Co. ""Further, he can take up the role of director or any other KMP.""
However, Sangeeta Jhunjhunwala, partner, Khaitan Legal Associates, said Sebi may challenge the SAT order in the Supreme Court, and intensify ongoing investigations.
The Zee stock, which climbed marginally after the order was announced during market hours, ended flat at Rs 249.3 apiece on the
National Stock Exchange
. Zee now has a market capitalisation just north of Rs 24,000 crore.
Elara Capital media analyst Karan Taurani pointed out that the SAT order will quicken the Sony-Zee merger process. Coupled with a potential deal between Reliance and Disney, the merger could redraw the boundaries of India's media and entertainment industries, he added.
Meanwhile, SAT, while allowing Goenka's appeal, made it clear that any observation made in this order is only prima facie. It also said the ruling will neither influence the investigation nor will it be utilised by either of the parties.
SAT said Sebi has not provided any reason for needing eight months to complete the investigation. Sebi had stated so in its confirmatory order. ""We have seen that on numerous occasions, whenever this tribunal or the superior court has directed Sebi to complete the investigation within a stipulated period, (it has) not been done, and application after application (is) filed by Sebi, seeking time to extend the period of investigation,"" the SAT noted.
Rejecting Sebi's argument for upholding the order, SAT added that Goenka's position as MD and CEO of the merged entity will not have any bearing on the investigation, since Sony Corp will appoint key executives in line with its majority holding in the new business.
Money trail
The Sebi investigation against Zee promoters pertains to November 2019, when three independent directors of the company resigned after raising concerns over several issues, including the alleged appropriation of a Zee fixed deposit of Rs 200 crore by Yes Bank for squaring off the loans of related parties of Essel Group, the promoter entity.
The market watchdog had come to the prima facie conclusion that the Goenkas had allegedly withdrawn funds from Zee and other listed companies of Essel Group, which ultimately benefited the promoter family.
Sebi also established the alleged modus operandi through which Rs 143.90 crore of Rs 200 crore had been transferred from Zee and other listed Essel companies to falsely portray repayment of dues.

The revenue growth can be attributed to the consistent performance of the entertainment business and the highest-ever revenue generated by the company from the Indian
Premier
League (IPL). The company is estimated to have generated Rs 3500 crore in ad revenue from
IPL
2022.
However, for the fiscal year, Star India's ad revenue declined by 4% to ₹11,186 crore. This decline was primarily a result of a subdued ad market, worsened by the cautious approach taken by FMCG advertisers and a decrease in ad spending within the startup ecosystem.
Subscription revenue (both TV and digital) grew 14% to ₹7,001 crore, aided by the presence of strong sports properties. The company's earnings from licensing content rights surged 74% to ₹1,446 crore.
Recently,
Walt Disney
disclosed that its sports business in India reported an operating loss of $444 million (₹3,703 crore) for the nine months ended July 1 on revenue of $637 million (₹5,313 crore).
For the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022, the Indian sports business recorded an operating loss of $237 million (₹1,976 crore) on revenue of $1.2 billion (₹10,009 crore).
Walt Disney follows the October-to-September financial calendar, while Star India follows the April-to-March calendar. Star India's total expenses surged by 16% to ₹18,759 crore, while operating expenses jumped 19% to ₹14,465 crore. Rights and programme costs rose 19% to ₹12,677 crore. License fees paid out increased by 24% to ₹704 crore.
Novi Digital Entertainment, the company's subsidiary, which owns Disney+ Hotstar, has seen a 118% jump in net loss to ₹748 crore, while revenue jumped 35% to ₹4,341 crore. Novi is in the process of merging with its parent company, Star, which holds a 78.07% stake in the company.
The company recognised an exceptional income of ₹219.7 crore during the previous year ended March 31, 2022, on account of the sale of its US business to Walt Disney subsidiary Buena Vista Video on Demand (BVVOD). Star, which had a net worth of ₹17,977 crore in FY23, has already combined Asianet Star Communications into itself after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) gave its approval in January.

Cinepolis India to spend '280 cr on adding 80 screens next year,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/cinepolis-india-to-spend-280-cr-on-adding-80-screens-next-year/articleshow/104736412.cms,26-10-2023,"Mexico-born cinema chain Cinepolis' Indian arm is looking to double its capex to '280 crore in 2024 as it looks to add 80 screens a year to achieve its eventual goal of having 1,000 screens in the country, CEO
Devang Sampat
told ET.
Cinepolis, which entered
India
in 2009, has 432 screens in the country and has been adding 40-50 screens per year. On average, the company spends '3.5 crore on launching a new screen.
""Apart from the 432 screens that we have in the country, we have signed another 600 screens that will become operational at various stages,""
Sampat
said, noting that the cinema exhibition industry's fate is very closely linked to the mall development activity in the country.
""For us, capex is not a constraint, but the infrastructure is. When we entered India in 2009, our original plan was to open 1,000 screens in 10 years,"" he added. Sampat stated that the pace of mall development that has been sluggish hampered the move in the country.

The
Cinepolis India
CEO said the company's growth in 2023 will be driven by record footfalls and an increase in the average ticket price (ATP). The company's regulatory filings show that its operating revenue stood at '367 crore in FY22.
The company earns 55% of its revenue from ticketing, followed by food and beverage (F&B), which contributes 35%, with advertising contributing the remaining 10%.
""The cinema exhibition business will remain stable because people don't go to a multiplex just for a movie but for the experience of watching a movie together with family and friends,"" he noted.
He also believes there is huge potential to grow the F&B revenue stream since multiplexes get enough footfalls every year.
""We don't have to hunt for customers, unlike quick service restaurants (QSRs), because we have 4 crore people coming to our cinemas every year. We just have to offer them what they want,"" he said.

Disney-Reliance Deal: Why Bob Iger should follow Murdoch’s lead and cash out,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-reliance-deal-why-bob-iger-should-follow-murdochs-lead-and-cash-out/articleshow/104711490.cms,26-10-2023,"A new class of competition is disrupting legacy media in the world’s most-populous nation, leading to a second change in the ownership of a popular franchise in four years.
Rupert Murdoch
was the first to see the threat. Now it’s
Bob Iger
’s turn.
The
Walt Disney
Co. boss is nearing a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell his Indian operations, Bloomberg News reported this week. In 2019, Iger was the buyer, and Murdoch the seller. The
Star India
business came to Disney as part of a $71 billion global acquisition of
21st Century Fox
Inc.’s entertainment assets. Even that transaction had a lot to do with India.
Murdoch received a warning shot when an upstart — Facebook Inc. — turned up at a 2017 Indian cricket league auction with a $600 million bid for streaming rights. Star saw off the threat by paying $2.55 billion for television and web for five years, but the writing was on the wall — the internet was coming for sports programming, the crown jewel of appointment viewing. Three months later, the Australian-born media mogul struck a deal with Iger. The transaction closed after about 15 months.
This time, the challenger is not Mark Zuckerberg, but
Mukesh Ambani
. In 2017, the Indian tycoon’s fledgling 4G telco was just starting to disrupt the wireless industry with free voice calls and cheap data. Six years later, he has more than 400 million customers, and a burgeoning consumer empire blurring the lines between carriage, content and commerce. The country’s digital market has exploded, but has also effectively shrunk into a duopoly. Legacy TV doesn’t stand a chance for too long in this altered landscape.
Which is why Iger is offloading the business in his second stint as the Disney chief executive. He’s valuing Star India — or
Disney Star
as it is now called — at $10 billion. Ambani views the assets at between $7 billion and $8 billion, according to Bloomberg News. A successful transaction will be a demonstration of Iger’s promise to take the behemoth closer to its core offerings of theme parks, Hulu and Disney+, and ESPN.

Disney said to near multibillion-dollar India deal with Reliance
For Ambani, too, it will be a critical validation. Foreign participation in Indian TV began in the early 1990s with a satellite transponder leased from the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. Murdoch entered in 1993 by buying Star from Li. Things are going to be different now. Japan’s Sony Group Corp. will still be in the driver’s seat of the country’s largest television network once it closes its long-pending merger with the homegrown
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
But Ambani will likely control a bigger share of consumers’ wallets and advertisers’ budgets.
That’s because a deal with Iger will help bring credibility to three of Ambani’s propositions — digital, retail and consumer finance. Last year, Ambani wrote a $2.7 billion check and snagged the streaming rights for Indian Premier League from Disney, essentially succeeding where Zuckerberg had failed in 2017. He also poached some of the key executives that had helped make Star India, and especially its Hotstar streaming service, a valuable franchise for Murdoch.
Although the Disney+ Hotstar platform in India is currently riding the wave of record World Cup Cricket viewership, the momentum has shifted toward Ambani’s
JioCinema
. All he needs to do now is to translate some of those eyeballs into consumer spending — both in his own stores and at the mom-and-pop shops affiliated with his retail network — and he will have a story for investors. Brands that want to sell nationally won’t be able to succeed unless they go through Ambani, in media as well as distribution.
What’s more, some of these brands — from cheap smartphones and laptops to fuzzy drinks and food — will be Ambani’s own. He will get to advertise them practically for free and drive demand with cheap finance.

Reliance-Disney deal likely to face a valuation hurdle
Jio, together with other Indian carriers, is also lobbying the telecom regulator for a right to charge large internet-traffic generators, such as Netflix Inc., a network-usage fee. That controversial levy will put pure-play content companies at a disadvantage to Ambani’s dominance across multiple, interconnected markets. (In August, Netflix decided to bundle its offering with Jio’s mobile data plans.)
Going forward, the only serious competition the conglomerate may face is from Amazon.com Inc. and the Mumbai-based Tata Group. Neither of them owns a telco, and Tata Group is absent from media, but at least they will compete against Ambani in three out of the five areas: wireless, on-screen entertainment, physical retail, e-commerce and finance.
Like in the mature US market, cable will eventually succumb to cord-cutting in India, too. But traditional TV still has a huge following among the nation’s 1.4 billion people. The real problem lies elsewhere. A media titan with a weakening grasp on cricket — and not much of a chance to make Bollywood work in its favor — doesn’t have a third magic bullet in India. Before buying 21st Century Fox, Disney had acquired a local studio to produce Hindi-language movies. That dream soured in about four years. By contrast, the Star Studios setup it got later from Murdoch is successful, but there may not be any point in holding on to it if Indian creators don’t allow it to profit off their intellectual property. The World Cup cricket rights will expire in 2027.
Iger would be wise to follow Murdoch’s lead and cash out.

MIB cancels registrations of 477 MSOs for failure to furnish information,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/mib-cancels-registrations-of-477-msos-for-failure-to-furnish-information/articleshow/104703664.cms,25-10-2023,"The
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
(MIB) has canceled the registrations of 477
multi-system operators
(MSOs) with immediate effect due to a violation of the provisions of the
Cable TV Networks Regulation Act
1995.
In an order dated October 23, the ministry said that an appeal against this order can be made to MIB Secretary
Apurva Chandra
, provided that such an appeal is made within 30 days of the issue of this order.
The 477 MSOs were already marked non-compliant since they had failed to furnish the information sought by the MIB.
The MIB had sent multiple reminders to the 477 MSOs to furnish information like the details of their subscriber base and set-top box (
STB
) seeding data. Despite repeated reminders, these MSOs had failed to furnish information to the ministry.
Despite being classified as non-compliant, the erring MSOs did not make any references to the MIB for the alteration of their status to compliant. Subsequently, the ministry issued Show Cause Notices (SCNs) to these MSOs, seeking an explanation for the contraventions.

""However, it has been observed that, despite the lapse of the given period, the scheduled MSOs have failed to provide the requisite information or make any reference to this ministry regarding their compliance status,"" the ministry said in its order.
In March, the MIB advised broadcasters not to enter into interconnection agreements with non-compliant MSOs and to notify the non-compliant MSOs with whom they already had interconnection agreements.

Future success of IPL media rights will depend on how they are packaged and segmented: Rajasthan Royals owner Manoj Badale,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/future-success-of-ipl-media-rights-will-depend-on-how-they-are-packaged-and-segmented-rajasthan-royals-owner-manoj-badale/articleshow/104681129.cms,25-10-2023,"Manoj Badale, the founder of Emerging Media, was one of the first supporters of the Indian
Premier
League (IPL) when it was conceived by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Badale thinks the
IPL
has a bright future, but to grow the league, the
BCCI
and the franchises need to elevate the fan experience.
In an interview with The Economic Times' Javed Farooqui, Badale said that the next
media rights
cycle will be very different from what we have seen thus far due to the rapid changes in the media consumption habits of consumers. The founder of Emerging Media thinks that, like American sports leagues, the BCCI should segment and package the
IPL media rights
to maximise value.
Edited excerpts:
Are Rajasthan Royals promoters looking to dilute stakes to a PE equity giant?
Not really! We just get a lot of inbound interest. We are focused on on-field and strong financial performance; the rest will take care of itself. We have not given any mandate to dilute stakes in the franchise. We have no plans to dilute Emerging Media's control of the franchise.
What level of interest has there been in the Rajasthan Royals among investors?

One of the things that have changed perhaps most dramatically in the last three or four years has been how attractive sport has become as an investment class for funds around the world, and we see that in America, Europe, and we're starting to see that in the IPL. Obviously, the first fund that came into the IPL was Redbird Capital through their investment in Rajasthan Royals, and then we saw CVC acquire the Ahmedabad franchise. I don't think there is a major investment fund in the world that isn't looking at sports. India is a hugely popular investment destination. You have the Indian macro story, and you have the sports macro story, and then the IPL is a fantastic fusion of the two.
Has investor interest in IPL grown after the latest media rights deal that was worth over Rs 48,000 crore?
BCCI has done a fantastic job with the previous media rights deals, but what you cannot afford is complacency because there are massive shifts in how we consume content that is going to affect the next media rights deal. In the last media rights deal, everyone focused on the headline number, but what I thought was more interesting was the split between TV and digital, and how that split between TV and digital evolves over time will be interesting. The other thing that you see in the US leagues is how thoughtful they have become about the segmentation of rights. Segmentation, although it's a bit of business jargon, is going to become an increasingly important word as you think about rights maximisation whether it's how the NFL has sold different nights of the week to different broadcasters or whether it's how they've sold different access rights to different digital broadcasters. The future success of
IPL media
rights will depend on how they are packaged and segmented.
Do you think BCCI should use a similar approach for the next IPL media rights sale and is segmenting rights possible in the Indian market given that the media rights split has made it extremely difficult for existing players to monetise?
Sometimes, when we judge the success or otherwise of investments in rights, we take too short a horizon and don't understand the full lifetime economics for both buyers. For Jio, for example, do you judge success purely based on ad income earned or how it fits into their broader broadband strategy? Sports media rights should be valued taking into account both ad revenue and the lifetime value of a new customer for the rights holder. I've been fortunate to be involved in the IPL before its inception and not only has the landscape changed in terms of television versus digital or between Indian broadcasters and global broadcasters, but what you're going to see in the next few years is the landscape changing even further from Indian and global broadcasters to global companies.
For companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, India is such a strategic priority that they can't ignore what the IPL rights can do, not just in terms of ad spend versus the cost of the rights but also in terms of overall brand perception and the overall lifetime value of customers. The one thing that I'm certain of is that while we sit here today with a list of potential bidders, there'll be a company that's not even on that list today, and that company in three years’ time could be bidding for the rights because of the pace of change.
When the IPL started, YouTube was a relatively new phenomenon. You never dreamed of Amazon buying the media rights in 2008, and you never thought about Apple getting into sports. Sometimes we constrain our thinking to the here and now, yet at the same time, we know the world is moving so quickly.
For BCCI, that means thinking about how it packages and segments those rights; it means thinking about how it presents those rights; it means thinking about what other innovations we can make so the way the game is played will enhance those rights. You can only control the inputs, but I'm confident that the outputs will be quite attractive in a few years.
What do you think the BCCI should do to strengthen the IPL even more?
It's our collective responsibility to expand the IPL's reach. I think creating the women's league was a very positive step. We were the first franchise to get involved in women's cricket nine years ago. Women's cricket has huge potential, and we were unfortunate not to be a successful bidder this time, but we are keen on owning a team in the Women’s Premier League, which obviously must make business sense.
It's crucial to consider the game's duration, especially for families with young children. The lengthening of the games and the need to travel home if they end after midnight make it more challenging for families with young children to attend games. My biggest focus would be making the fan experience better, and the structure of the game should be time-friendly. That will allow the game to expand.
Given that the IPL only lasts for 2.5 months out of the year, how are you attempting to connect with the fans all year long?
That is indeed one of the biggest challenges for franchises, which is: how do you create year-round fan engagement when you have a tournament that's two and a half months in duration? What we try to do is really invest in digital content assets. We have extended our reach into two other leagues (SA20 and Caribbean Premier League) to create opportunities for the coaching staff and playing staff to experience life under the Royals banner outside of the IPL, but the truth is, there's a limitation on how much we can engage fans in the non-IPL parts of the season. We have to respect that we are part of a broader ecosystem, and right now, the world is focused on the Cricket World Cup. We don't have a right to own the cricket calendar. We must do what we can within the constraints of the existing window.
How was IPL 2023 for the Rajasthan Royals on key metrics like revenue and fan engagement?
I think financially, it was a success. It was a very frustrating IPL for our team because we underperformed relative to our capabilities. We effectively had two seasons. We had a first half where we had five wins and two losses, and we had a second half where we had two wins and five losses. So, it was frustrating on the field. Off-field, it was fantastic to be back in Jaipur. We have had many historical challenges playing in Jaipur, whether that be battles that the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) is having with the BCCI or whether that's been related to stadium readiness. Nothing, however, compares to the Rajasthan Royals playing in Jaipur. Having said that, we don't benefit from the same infrastructure that the other teams have. We don't have a Wankhede stadium or Eden Gardens kind of stadium in Rajasthan. But it was balanced by our experiment in taking the Rajasthan Royals to Guwahati, which has one of the best stadiums in India. That was hugely successful, and we will hopefully do that again. Hosting matches in Guwahati will help us open new territories for IPL.
How strong is your P&L right now given that the new media rights cycle has started?
Without a doubt, the franchises' financial standing is better than it has ever been, but we shouldn't forget that it took us ten years to turn a profit. In the first ten years, we always kept a very tight ship running. Today, everyone is focused on profitability, but they overlook the ten years of investment that preceded it. If you look at what the first eight franchises did to help the IPL grow, they invested close to a billion dollars in total, which is sometimes forgotten.
What plan do you have to expand the Rajasthan Royals brand?
We are one of the earliest franchises to make an investment in the academies. We want to expand that academic network across India. We are making low-cost education available through the
Royals School of Business
. I think 15 years ago, not many parents would have thought about whether a career in sports was a good option. We want to make an impact on professionalising the sports industry and making sports an attractive profession to build. One of the challenges we have off-field is recruitment. The pool of sports professionals is quite small, and we want to expand that pool.
You mentioned India as a significant international investment destination. You have founded Blenheim Chalcot, a company that has been developing digital technology platforms for 25 years. What strategies is Blenheim Chalcot pursuing in India?
We are investing in India at a more significant rate than we have at any other time in the last 25 years. We now have 700 people in the country. We're continuing to grow that. We're launching health tech applications and fintech applications over the next two to three years.
In the next two to three years, what kind of investments have you planned for India?
We plan to invest tens of millions of dollars in India over the next few years. Over the years, Blenheim Chalcot would have invested north of $50 million into India. Blenheim Chalcot is a venture builder, and we are not a venture investor. We build businesses from scratch, and right now we're building businesses in health tech and fintech. An example would be a business called HemeHealth, which is trying to help individuals take control of their medical records in partnership with employers and insurers to help build a healthier India.
In financial services, we're always looking at marketplaces. Obviously, with the government's decision to automate payments, there's an extraordinary payment infrastructure in the country that allows the building of new financial services players on top of that. We're probably the largest fintech venture builder in the UK, if not Europe, so it'd be nice to bring some of that expertise to India at some point.
For us, generative technology is currently a major focus both in India and internationally. In Mumbai, we are developing a world-class centre for generative technology. Generic technology is one of the most significant technological advancements we have encountered in the past 25 years, if not the most significant. India's technology sector has the best young talent in the entire world.

"Exercise extreme caution on portrayal of SCs, STs: BCCC advisory to entertainment channels",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/exercise-extreme-caution-on-portrayal-of-scs-sts-bccc-advisory-to-entertainment-channels/articleshow/104501879.cms,17-10-2023,"The
Broadcasting Content Complaint Council
(BCCC) on Tuesday asked
entertainment channels
to exercise ""extreme caution"" while portraying the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in television programmes to avoid hurting the sentiments of the members of the two communities. The channels, while depicting the stories of the members of the scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) communities, must ensure that the ""nuance and humanness"" of the stories are communicated ""sensitively"" and that the violence displayed does not lead to ""re-traumatization"" of the communities or victims, the council said in its advisory.
While portraying stories which are based solely on social evils such as untouchability and casteism, the entertainment channels should not engage in ""victimization"" of the people belonging to SC and ST communities, the self regulatory body of non-news entertainment channels said.
It said it understands that many stories possess a moral or ethical dimension requiring portrayal of the ""good"" and the ""evil"", including depiction of characters doing ""evil deeds"".
""However, while doing so, the channel must ensure that it doesn't use language that is unlawful and which might hurt the sentiments of a particular community,"" it added.
The BCCC asks channels to be ""cautious and balanced"" while depicting scenes pertaining to these communities as even an isolated episode scene taken out of context can cause unrest among these communities, the council said.

The channels should ""exercise extreme caution in order to avoid hurting the sentiments of people belonging to the SC and ST communities"", it added.
The BCCC noted that crimes against SCs and STs are ""rampant"" in Indian society and range from physical to verbal and sexual assault.
""Furthermore, although untouchability has been abolished by the
Indian Constitution
, it is still widely practised, leading to severe forms of discrimination against members of these communities,"" the Council said, underlining that television is not only a reflection of society but it also constructs ""social realities"".
""Thus, what must be borne in mind by content creators is that the kind of stories portrayed on television, as fiction or fact, shape societal thinking. They do so by setting ideals for human behaviour across social situations while providing avenues to escape one's reality,"" the Council added.
According to the 2011 census, a total of 16.6 per cent and 8.6 per cent of the Indian population belongs to the SC and ST communities respectively.
""This is no small number. Therefore, attention must be paid to ensure that words of insult and derision towards SC and ST groups are excluded from scripts,"" the advisory, approved by BCCC chairperson Justice Gita Mittal said.
These include words denoting the names of castes used as insults or words used with an intention to degrade a person due to his or her membership to a certain caste group, even if they are shown to be belonging to that caste group as notified by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 and The Constitution (Scheduled Tribe) Order, 1950, the Council added.

No plans to dilute stake in Rajasthan Royals: Manoj Badale,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/no-plans-to-dilute-stake-in-rajasthan-royals-manoj-badale/articleshow/104484090.cms,17-10-2023,"Emerging Media Ventures, the owner of
Indian Premier League
(
IPL
) team
Rajasthan Royals
(RR), has no intention of selling a portion of its controlling stake in the franchise despite interest from private equity and venture capital firms, founder
Manoj Badale
told ET.
""We have not given any mandate to dilute stakes in the franchise. We have no plans to dilute Emerging Media's control of the franchise,"" Badale said, adding that the franchise gets lots of inbound interest from funds globally.
Media reports said in May that New York-headquartered Tiger Global is looking to invest around $40 million in Rajasthan Royals at $650 million valuation.
""We are just focused on on-field and strong financial performance; the rest will take care of itself,"" Badale said.
Emerging Media, an investment vehicle controlled by Badale, owns a 65% stake in Royal Multisport, which owns and operates RR.

In 2021, Red Bird Capital bought a 15% stake in RR for a reported valuation of $250 million. Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Director and CEO of Fox Corporation, has also retained his shareholding in the franchise.
While Badale is tightlipped about RR's valuation, industry sources say that most IPL franchises are eyeing valuations in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.
Global investment bank Houlihan Lokey had earlier this year pegged the IPL's business enterprise value at $15.4 billion.
Badale also said that the franchise will evaluate a public listing of the IPL team after the next cycle of IPL media rights are awarded by the Indian cricket board.
The current five-year media rights cycle will end in 2027. Disney Star and
Viacom
18 have acquired the TV and digital rights, respectively, for a cumulative sum of $6 billion.
""We are too small for a public listing right now. We might look at a public listing post the next media rights,"" he said.
Badale also clarified that RR has no plan to buy a cricket franchise in other leagues. Apart from Rajasthan Royals in India, the company also owns Barbados Royals in the Caribbean
Premier
League and Paarl Royals in the South African T20 league.
""One of the things that has changed dramatically in the last 3–4 years has been how attractive sports have become as an investment class for funds around the world, and now, we are starting to see that happen in the IPL,"" he stated.
Blenheim Chalcot, the UK-based digital venture builder co-founded by Badale and Charles Mindenhall, is also looking to grow its investment in India by venturing into the health tech and fintech space over the next 2 to 3 years.
""Blenheim Chalcot plans to spend tens of millions of dollars in India over the next few years. We have 700 people in the country; we continue to grow that,"" he said.
It is also building a campus in Andheri, which will provide software development, data science, and financial support to Blenheim Chalcot's portfolio companies across Europe and America.
In addition, Blenheim Chalcot is also building a generative technology centre of excellence in Mumbai. ""We are very focused on generative technology in India and globally,"" Badale said.

“Both the companies, Novi Digital and Star India are unlisted entities, hence they will have to face relatively lesser compliance compared to such transactions for listed companies,” said Faiza Dhanani, partner of law firm Cue Legal. “Apart from shareholders’ approval, the companies will have to seek approval from the tax authorities, lenders and sector regulators while the adjudicating authority is still hearing the case.”
The development takes place as Walt Disney searches for strategic buyers for Star India.
Walt Disney has approached
Reliance Industries

How a kids storyteller plans to bridge generations through animated Ramayana series,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/how-a-kids-storyteller-plans-to-bridge-generations-through-animated-ramayana-series/articleshow/104255777.cms,08-10-2023,"Stories are a great way to communicate with kids and give them lifelong lessons about ethics, tradition, leadership, and many more things. It's said that reading your child just one tale every day can teach them 78,000 new words in a year. But in this era of digital reels, getting kids attention is very difficult these days.
Parents always try to find new ways to engage with kids to teach them survival lessons. Storytelling is one way to generate lifelong emotions and memories. A lot of generations still remember special childhood lessons learned from grandparents listening to them talk about the struggles and the divine of Lord
Rama
and
Krishna
in epics like the
Ramayana
and Mahabharata. The epic television series of the Ramayana and
Mahabharata
is still keenly watched by children and elders even today.
Every parent wants their kids to have experiences like these. Keeping this in mind, a children's storyteller company,
Jumbaya
has launched an animated read-along storybook format titled “Ramayana: The Journey of Sita and Rama,” designed for children aged 6–14 years. ""Through this initiative, Jumbaya aims to bring people of different generations together through the magic of stories. We want to integrate technology with tradition to inspire a sense of wonder in young hearts about their rich cultural heritage,"" the company said.
""In the epic Ramayana, there exists a humble tale of a squirrel's contribution to Lord Rama's legendary bridge-building. The squirrel's tiny pebbles filled the gaps between the boulders, fortifying the bridge. Lord Rama, recognizing the squirrel's dedication, blessed it with a stroke, imprinting three distinctive stripes on squirrels. This story serves as a reminder that even the smallest efforts can yield substantial results. The Ramayana, a timeless epic, abounds with such anecdotes of valor and virtue,"" Jumbaya said.
The Ramayana, believed to have been written by Maharishi Valmiki around the 5th century BCE, serves as a narrative teaching the life of Lord Rama, the prince of Ayodhya, to his sons Lav and Kush. Its themes of virtue, duty, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil continue to inspire individuals from diverse backgrounds.

Jumbaya said it believes in the power of reading and aims to cultivate this habit during children's formative years. To achieve this, they use SLS (Same Language Subtitling), which displays spoken words as text on the screen, synchronized with audio. This approach helps children connect sounds with letters, enhancing their vocabulary and engaging their visual and auditory senses.
""The story has been dissected into a narrative of 6–10 minute storybooks,"" Jumbaya added.

. is holding preliminary discussions with potential buyers for its
India
streaming and television business including billionaires
Gautam Adani
and
Kalanithi Maran
, according to people familiar with the matter.
The US entertainment giant’s senior executives have also gauged the interest of private equity funds considering the company is exploring a range of options, which could involve selling part of the Indian operations or a combination of the unit’s assets including sports rights and regional streaming service Disney+
Hotstar
, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.
Asset-sale talks have already been held with
Reliance Industries Ltd.
, controlled by Asia’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani, Bloomberg News reported earlier on.
Disney has been weighing strategic options for its business in India including an outright sale or setting up a joint venture, Bloomberg News reported in July after the unit lost its streaming rights to the Indian Premier League cricket tournament to Viacom18 Media Pvt.
Viacom

A potential acquisition could complement Maran’s broadcasting company,
Sun TV
Network Ltd., while for the
Adani
Group, it could help expand its newly acquired New Delhi Television Ltd., the people said. They added that deliberations are still at a very preliminary stage and any deal may not happen.

Representatives for
Disney
in India declined to comment. Sun TV Network Group Chief financial Officer S L Narayanan said the group doesn’t comment on market rumours or speculation. A spokesperson for Adani also said they wouldn’t comment on market speculation.
The discussions around the sale of Disney’s India unit show how the market dynamics have been disrupted ever since Ambani’s conglomerate scooped up the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League for $2.7 billion and chose to broadcast it for free earlier this year. Ambani scored another win by bagging a multi-year pact to broadcast Warner Bros Discovery Inc.’s HBO and other content that was previously with Disney.
Disney is now using Reliance’s playbook and streaming the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India for free — a move aimed at clawing back some subscribers even if it means sacrificing revenue in the cricket-crazy nation of 1.4 billion people.
Disney, however, is likely getting a boost as marquee global brands line up to tap India’s massive consumer base, with advertising slots being sold at $3,600 a second. Disney Star, which holds the exclusive TV broadcast rights for the event in India, said in a statement Wednesday that it’s partnering with 26 sponsors, including heavyweights like Booking.com BV and liquor company Diageo Plc.
Cricket is by far the most popular sport in the South Asia nation and attracts more than $1.5 billion in sponsorship and media spending every year, according to research from Jefferies LLC, or about 85% of all sports-related spending in the country.
Even as Disney Star has battled sliding subscriber numbers after losing the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League, the media group hasn’t ceded the entire cricket business, securing the television rights through 2027.
Last year, Disney Star agreed to license the TV rights for International Cricket Council men’s matches to
ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
for four years, with Disney+ Hotstar retaining the digital rights.

Temasek in talks with Tata Group to offload 20% stake in Tata Play,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/temasek-in-talks-with-tata-group-to-offload-20-stake-in-tata-play/articleshow/104196002.cms,06-10-2023,"Singapore-based investment firm
Temasek
is in advanced talks with the
Tata Group

to the Indian conglomerate that owns the largest stake in the direct-to-home (DTH) company, people privy to the development told ET.
""There has been a lot of movement in the discussions between the two companies in the past few weeks,"" one of the people said.
The Singapore government-owned company wants to sell its stake at a valuation of over $1 billion, another person said. This is far less than the $2 billion valuation that another stakeholder,
Walt Disney Co
, was eyeing in 2021.
""At one point, the Tata Play shareholders were looking at a valuation of close to $3 billion,"" this person added.

Temasek said it does not comment on market speculation. Tata Group and Tata Play declined to comment.
A media veteran said a valuation of $1 billion for Tata Play will be a massive discount compared to what the company was valued for earlier. ""Temasek has been desperately trying to exit Tata Play, but they have not been able to exit due to differences over valuation and failed attempts at doing a public listing,"" he added.
Temasek first bought a 10% stake in Tata Play, which was earlier known as Tata Sky, for a reported '250 crore in 2007.
Experts say that the DTH business has been under stress due to subscriber churn from pay-DTH to DD Free Dish and over-the-top platforms.
""DD Free Dish is eating into the pay-DTH base in rural and semi-urban areas while OTT is chipping away at the top end of the customer base,"" a media executive said on the condition of anonymity.
""Free cricket streaming by Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema will cause a further dent in their subscriber base,"" the executive added.
The active subscriber base of pay-DTH platforms declined by 1.37 million QoQ to 65.25 million in the quarter ended March, according to a Trai report. Tata Play had 21.3 million subscribers as of end-March.
Tata Play has ventured into the OTT aggregation business to make up for the loss from the DTH market.
Apart from Temasek,
Walt Disney
and
Tata Opportunities Fund
(TOF) are also looking to exit the company. Walt Disney, which got a 30% stake in Tata Play as part of its acquisition of
Star India
, does not identify DTH as its core business.
The Tata Group's stake in the company are through
Tata Sons
(41.49%) TOF-owned
Omega
(7.8%) and
Tata Capital
(0.71%)
Tata Play is once again considering an initial public offering in order to give Disney an exit after multiple failed attempts to go public.
The company's IPO plan was approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India in May. Tata Play was the first Indian company to file confidential documents with Sebi for an IPO last year.
Tata Play recorded a net loss of '105 crore for the fiscal year ended in March 2023, compared with a net profit of '69 crore the year before. Revenue from operations dropped 5.1% to '4,499 crore.

TDSAT refuses to grant interim relief to AIDCF against Star's free cricket streaming,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tdsat-refuses-to-grant-interim-relief-to-aidcf-against-stars-free-cricket-streaming/articleshow/104186513.cms,05-10-2023,"The All India Digital Cable Federation (
AIDCF
), which requested a stay on
Star
India's free cricket streaming on Disney+ Hotstar, has been denied interim relief by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (
TDSAT
).
The next hearing date is December 18, and the TDSAT has instructed AIDCF to submit a rejoinder affidavit by that date or earlier. Earlier, the tribunal had directed Star India to file its reply by October 3.
The tribunal noted that over-the-top (OTT) platforms are not covered under the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (TRAI) regulations. The rejection of interim relief to AIDCF will allow Star to stream the ICC CWC for free on Disney+ Hotstar. It had also streamed the recently concluded Asia Cup for free to mobile users.
""Prima facie, the OTT platform is not a TV channel, nor is the respondent requiring any permission or a license from the Central Government. Moreover, looking at the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the rules framed thereunder for the year 2021, and looking at the provisions of the TRAI Act, 1997, there is no prima facie case with this petitioner,"" TDSAT said in its judgment.
The tribunal noted that the balance of convenience is also not in favor of AIDCF, and no irreparable loss will be caused to its members if the stay, as prayed for, is not granted.

It stated that the AIDCF members can maintain a separate list of consumers who have subscribed to the Star Sports channel, as the same contents are being made available through video streaming on the said OTT platform.
""These details, which the petitioner is maintaining, can always be presented before this tribunal by way of an affidavit before the final hearing of this broad petition, which will be replied to by the respondent. Hence, the interim relief, as prayed for by this petitioner, is hereby rejected,"" it stated.
The AIDCF had urged the TDSAT to direct Star India to stop its free cricket offering on Disney+ Hotstar, claiming that the subscribers of its members like Hathway Digital, DEN Networks, Siti Networks, and GTPL Hathway also want to watch live cricket for free.
Additionally, it had also argued that the broadcaster is favoring one group of viewers over another by charging cable TV subscribers for the same content while giving it away for free to Disney+ Hotstar members.
The same also goes against the TRAI's regulatory framework, which aims to establish a comprehensive environment that ensures transparency, non-discrimination, and subscriber safety, the AIDCF asserted.
Star India has argued before the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) that over-the-top (OTT) and TV distributors, including cable, DTH, and HITS, cannot be compared because they are two distinct businesses subject to different legal regimes.
The media company, which runs a lineup of over 70 channels in addition to the streaming service Disney+ Hotstar, has rejected the All India Digital Cable Federation's (AIDCF) claim that it discriminates against pay-TV subscribers by making the Asia Cup and ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 free to OTT users.
Additionally, Star India argued that it is not the only broadcaster to offer cricket for free to users of its OTT platforms.
Star stated another broadcaster is also providing cricket on a free basis to its OTT users, in a veiled reference to Viacom18, which is providing the Indian cricket team's bilateral matches for free to JioCinema users.
The AIDCF petition is not maintainable because it not only calls for parity with an OTT platform but also attempts to control its content, argues Star.
In June, Disney+ Hotstar stated that both the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023, which starts on October 5, and the just-completed Asia Cup will be free for mobile subscribers. Star India is the owner of the TV and digital rights to these events.
Besides streaming the events on Disney+ Hotstar, Star India is also airing the matches on its paid broadcast network, Star Sports.

It is preferable to distribute content through a partner rather than introduce an over-the-top (OTT) app in the initial stage, said Nitin Menon, managing partner at NV Capital.
""In India, operating an OTT business in capex is heavy and highly competitive in terms of capturing market share; hence, it is better to test the market through distribution partners and then build it from there. Additionally, the market for the English language is currently modest, though there is a huge opportunity to grow organically over the coming decade,"" he said.
""The US market is currently
Paramount'
's main focus area, and they are looking into collaborations in other markets. All legacy media businesses are under stress due to the difficulties their linear TV business is experiencing. They are re-evaluating their global strategy as a result of the pressure on their linear business, particularly since OTT is a capital-intensive industry,"" said media veteran Anuj Gandhi, who is also the Founder of Plug and Play Entertainment.
Paramount+ is the second American streaming app to rethink its India strategy. Earlier, Warner Bros. Discovery had put the India launch of Max, earlier known as HBO Max, on hold.
Subsequently, Warner Bros. Discovery moved its content from Disney+ Hotstar to JioCinema, which is now the home of Warner Bros. and HBO content in India. The multi-year content deal between Warner Bros. and JioCinema entails an annual payout of $20 million.
Last year, Paramount announced that Paramount+ would launch in India in 2023 in partnership with Viacom18.
Speaking at the Credit Suisse Communications Conference in June 2022, Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish said Paramount+ will be bundled with Viacom18's super service while referring to JioCinema, which gained prominence with the free streaming of the FIFA World Cup 2022 and the Indian Premier League 2023.
He also said that launching Paramount+ in partnership with Viacom18 would mean that the company wouldn’t need to invest in local content and marketing.
""We are also going to launch in India. We’re doing it with our JV, Viacom18, which also has Reliance as a partner. Reliance is the most powerful company in India and now has Bodhi Tree involved too. They just got exclusive streaming rights for cricket (IPL digital rights). Now the cricket won't be on Paramount+, but Paramount+ will be bundled with their super service,"" Bakish had said. ""So again, we don't have to invest in local content. We don't have to invest in local marketing. We ride alongside the super service and benefit from the market – very excited about this model.""
As of June, Paramount+ had 61 million subscribers globally. Showtime, Paramount's other streaming platform, had merged with Paramount+.
The Paramount+ content offering includes Hollywood blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible, Bumblebee, and G.I. Joe; CBS TV programmes like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and NCIS; animated series including Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants and Comedy Central's South Park, besides Showtime titles such as Dexter and Ray Donovan, and MTV's cult classic music shows.

World Cup streaming remains free on Hotstar as Disney Star gets a big relief,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/world-cup-streaming-remains-free-on-hotstar-as-disney-star-gets-a-big-win-source-says/articleshow/104178952.cms,05-10-2023,"In a major relief for Disney Star, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal has allowed the broadcaster to go ahead with free streaming of ICC cricket
World Cup
on their OTT platform Disney+
Hotstar
.
In September, the All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF) had urged TDSAT to instruct Star India to discontinue the free cricket streaming on Disney+ Hotstar. They contended that customers serviced by their members also expect to access live cricket content without any charges.
The TDSAT has denied interim relief to the AIDCF seeking an injunction against Disney Star from making available the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 for free on mobile. The TDSAT found that prima facie OTT is not covered by the TRAI Act.
""Prima facie, the OTT platform is not a TV channel, nor is the respondent requiring any permission or a license from the Central Government. Moreover, looking at the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the rules framed thereunder for the year 2021, and looking at the provisions of the TRAI Act, 1997, there is no prima facie case with this petitioner,"" according to TDSAT judgment.
The next hearing date is December 18

Disney Star, the official broadcaster of World Cup 2023 both on TV and digital, had announced that they will stream the marquee tournament for free on mobile devices via their Disney+ Hotstar app.
The federation had lodged a complaint with the TDSAT regarding Walt Disney-owned company's move to provide free access to the recently concluded Asia Cup and the upcoming ICC Men's Cricket World Cup for mobile users through its streaming service.
The tribunal had notified Star India about this complaint and requested a response by October 3. On television, Star India is broadcasting the matches through the paid Star Sports network.
ET had reported that the federation, in its petition, had contended that the broadcaster is discriminating between sets of consumers by charging cable TV subscribers for the same content while offering it free to Disney+ Hotstar users.
It noted that charging for the same content on TV while making it free online goes against the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's regulatory framework, which aims to establish a comprehensive environment that ensures transparency and non-discrimination, and subscriber safety.
Free streaming of key sports on OTTs is becoming a trend in India. JioCinema had live streamed Fifa World CUp last year. Also, Mukesh Ambani-owned JioCinema had offered the Indian Premier League free to all internet users in the country during the summers this year. The platform plans to keep sports free as it looks to scale up its business.

As the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 returns to India after a 12-year hiatus, coinciding with the festive season and the success of the Asia Cup, advertisers are vying for prime spots in anticipation of record-breaking viewership and heightened brand visibility.
Arch cricket rivals India and Pakistan are set to play against each other in the World Cup and these games are usually a big crowd-puller. Media experts had also said earlier that matches involving Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are expected to see a scale equivalent to an India-Pakistan match.
A Disney Star top official had earlier said they are bullish about getting robust sponsorships from most sectors, be it startups or established firms, banking on flexible advertising packages for the recently-concluded marquee Asia Cup and upcoming ICC ODI World Cup, which are likely to get unprecedented reach.

Zee-Sony show runs into overtime; legal glitches behind delay: Experts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-sony-show-runs-into-overtime-legal-glitches-behind-delay-experts/articleshow/104055239.cms,30-09-2023,"Mumbai:
Sony
Group Corp Friday said that there would be a delay of several months in the merger of its local media unit
Sony Pictures Networks
India with
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(
ZEEL
), while adding that both parties would pursue the processes necessary to close the deal that aims to create one of the biggest media companies in Asia's third-largest economy.
""Although the transaction was previously expected to close by the end of the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, based on the latest progress, it is currently expected to close in the months ahead,"" Sony Group said in a statement. ""Sony continues to assess the impact of the transaction on its consolidated financial results.""
Legal procedures may be the primary reason for the delay, experts said. The Tokyo-based conglomerate, which is Japan's fourth-biggest company by market value, didn't give specific reasons behind the delay in closing the transaction. Sony had earlier said it anticipated the merger to be concluded by September this year.
""By the end of the first half of this fiscal year, we are trying to complete the merger with ZEEL,"" Sony Chairman and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida had said in May.
Sony Corp's market capitalisation is $102 billion.
Zee
Entertainment, which has climbed nearly a fourth in the past six months in anticipation of the merger, has a market capitalisation in excess of Rs 25,410 crore (equivalent to about $3 billion). Zee's stock price rose about 4% Friday to Rs 264.10 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Sony's announcement came during the trading hours in Mumbai.

Pending Cases
Legal experts believe that the merger has been delayed due to the ongoing court cases at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and the
Securities Appellate Tribunal
(SAT). ""It seems that the pending challenge to the National Company Law Tribunal order by Axis Finance, alleging that the order is in violation of the market regulator's ruling vis-a-vis Punit Goenka, may be the issue holding back the completion of the transaction,"" said Abhishek Malhotra, Practice Managing Partner, TMT Law.
Despite obtaining all requisite approvals for the merger, the appointment of Zee promoter family's Punit Goenka as MD and CEO of the merged company remains uncertain due to a Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) order that prevents him from heading the combined entity. Goenka has contested this order before SAT, which reserved its order in the matter earlier this week. Elara Capital SVP Karan Taurani said that the merger could be delayed by 4-6 weeks.
""The delay in the merger is primarily because of the conditional precedents that both parties are going through. They are trying to include the financials of MergeCo just beyond July and may be toward the September financials also before they give out a record date for the delisting,"" he added.
$10-Billion Entity
The merger of Sony and Zee will create a $10-billion corporation with presence across media vehicles -- TV, over-the-top (OTT), and content production. As per FY23 financials, the combined revenue of Zee and Sony was approximately ₹14,772 crore, or more than $1.5 billion. In an interview with ET in June, Goenka, who is the MD & CEO of Zee, said that the current contractual drop-off date for the merger is December 20, 2023.
""We can go until December 2023 without it impacting the deal as we have framed it. But if at all it needs to be discussed at some point in time, we will take it up,"" he had said. The merger scheme involving
Sony Pictures
Networks, Zee, and Sony Pictures unit Bangla Entertainment was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal on August 10.
The merger has also received the green light from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the two primary stock exchanges in the country. Once the merger is completed, Sony will indirectly hold 50.86% of the combined company; the founders of Zee will hold 3.99%; and the other Zee shareholders will hold a 45.15% stake.

World Cup cricket matches
were ""extremely popular, especially in the Indian subcontinent"" and rogue websites, which in the past have also indulged in piracy, were very likely to continue the authorised streaming.
""Thus, there is a need to restrain any rogue websites from disseminating and communicating to the public any part of the cricket match events without authorisation or license from the plaintiffs,"" the court said in a recent order.

""Accordingly, defendant Nos.1 to 9 (various rogue websites which are stated to be primarily hosting illegal and pirated content) are restrained by an ad-interim order from communicating, screening, making available or disseminating any part of the ICC World Cup Cricket matches on any electronic or digital platform in any manner whatsoever,"" ordered the court.
If an injunction is not granted at this stage, irreparable harm would be caused to the plaintiffs, the court stated.
It further directed the authorities concerned to block and suspend the websites and clarified that if any further offending websites are discovered, the plaintiff can communicate their details to both Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Electronics and internet service provider for issuance of blocking orders.

Delhi HC issues order prohibiting unauthorised streaming of ICC Cricket World Cup,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/delhi-hc-issues-order-prohibiting-unauthorised-streaming-of-icc-cricket-world-cup/articleshow/104042643.cms,29-09-2023,"The
Delhi High Court
has issued an order prohibiting online platforms from broadcasting and
streaming
the upcoming ICC
Men's Cricket World Cup 2023
without authorization.
This legal action was initiated in response to a lawsuit filed by Star India Pvt Ltd and Novi Digital Entertainment Pvt Ltd, the operator of the Disney+ Hotstar platform. These plaintiffs claim to hold exclusive global media rights, encompassing both television and digital rights, for various ICC events, including the highly anticipated
World Cup
scheduled to take place from October 5 to November 19.
Recognizing the immense popularity of the World Cup cricket matches, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, Justice Prathiba M Singh underscored the risk of rogue websites engaging in unauthorized dissemination of World Cup content. Many such websites have a history of piracy, and they are likely to persist in their unauthorized streaming activities.
In response to these concerns, the court has taken a proactive stance. In a recent order, it stated, ""Thus, there is a need to restrain any rogue websites from disseminating and communicating to the public any part of the cricket match events without authorization or license from the plaintiffs.""
Consequently, the court has issued an ad-interim order restraining various rogue websites (referred to as defendant Nos. 1 to 9), which primarily host illegal and pirated content, from broadcasting, screening, making available, or disseminating any portion of the ICC World Cup Cricket matches on any electronic or digital platform in any manner whatsoever.

"Merger with Zee to take a few more months, Sony says",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/merger-with-zee-to-take-a-few-more-months-sony-says/articleshow/104036170.cms,29-09-2023,"The merger between
Zee Entertainment
and Culver Max Entertainment, formerly known as
Sony
Pictures Networks
India
will likely take a few more months, news agency Reuters quoted Sony as saying on Friday.
Sony has said that the completion of the merger with Zee was previously expected to conclude by the end of September. However, the merger has been embroiled in controversies over the past few months. Various operational and financial creditors had objected to the Zee-Sony merger scheme in the NCLT.
Sony said that the impact on its consolidated earnings from this delay remains unknown.
In December 2021, Zee Entertainment and Sony Pictures agreed to merge their businesses.
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on August 10 gave its approval to the merger of Zee and Sony creating a USD 10 billion media house, the biggest in the country. Both media houses approached the tribunal for sanctioning the merger after obtaining permissions from the National Stock Exchange, BSE and sectoral regulators, such as the Competition Commission of India and the
Securities and Exchange Board of India

Soon after the NCLT gave its nod for the merger, India's markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India barred promoters Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka from holding positions of a director or key managerial personnel in various group companies, including Zee Entertainment, Zee Media, and any other entity formed by merging group companies.
Once all the requisite approvals are through, Zee will be delisted, and the merged company will be relisted as Sony-Zee wherein 100 shares of Zee will enable shareholders to get 85 shares of the merged entity. “We do not expect any change in the deal contours despite the long delay, as NCLT has approved the scheme,” Karan Taurani of Elara Capital told ET.

Mukesh Ambani’s JioCinema to appoint former Google manager Kiran Mani as CEO,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/mukesh-ambanis-jiocinema-to-appoint-former-google-manager-kiran-mani-as-ceo/articleshow/104032887.cms,29-09-2023,"JioCinema
plans to appoint former
Google
general manager
Kiran Mani
chief executive officer, leading the Indian streaming TV service’s effort to broaden its reach among mobile customers, according to people familiar with the move.
Mani formerly ran Google’s Android operations in the Asia Pacific region. He’s going to lead technology development for the service and facilitate partnerships with Hollywood studios, said the people, who asked not be identified discussing internal matters.
The executive, who has already started at the company, was an early investor and adviser to James Murdoch and Uday Shankar’s Bodhi Tree investment firm, according to his Linkedin page. JioCinema’s parent company, Viacom18, is a joint venture of Indian billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
’s
Reliance Industries Ltd.
, Paramount Global and Bodhi Tree. A Reliance Industries representative did not offer any immediate comment.
India, with its 1.4 billion people, has been a fierce battleground for global media companies. Google and its YouTube subsidiary are already popular in the country. Earlier this year, JioCinema offered free streaming of a major cricket tournament in a bid to lure more paying subscribers. The service costs 999 rupees or about $12 annually.
As part of its expansion plans, JioCinema signed new programming deals this year with entertainment giants Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal.

Sponsors line up for World Cup at Disney Star,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sponsors-line-up-for-world-cup-at-disney-star/articleshow/103997992.cms,28-09-2023,"MUMBAI:
Disney Star
, which has set an advertising revenue target of more than Rs 4,000 crore from the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup (CWC) 2023, has signed up multiple sponsors for the tournament which begins on October 5.
The company has engaged PhonePe, Mahindra, Coca-Cola (Charged),
Hindustan Unilever
(Glow and Lovely),
IndusInd Bank
,
Mondelez
and Jindal Panther as broadcast sponsors.
For digital, the sponsors are Mahindra, Booking.com, Hindustan Unilever (
Surf Excel
), Louis Philippe, Kingfisher, Coca-Cola (Thums-Up), Black & White and
MRF
.
The event, which will be played at 10 venues across India, will be telecast on the Star Sports network, besides being streamed free for mobile users on Disney+ Hotstar.
Media experts say the broadcaster could potentially draw revenue of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore from the ICC CWC on both TV and digital since new-age advertisers are missing from the scene and the gaming category has taken a big hit due to the 28% goods and services tax (GST).

The company is believed to have earned Rs 200-220 crore from the recently concluded Asia Cup, against a target of Rs 500-600 crore.
While Disney Star declined to comment, company executives have claimed that many more advertising deals are expected to close in the next few days.
Mindshare South Asia CEO Amin Lakhani said demand for advertising during the World Cup has seen a surge compared to what it was a month and a half ago.
“Depending on the appetite and the budget, clients are opting for sponsorships or customised packages that Disney Star has created,” he said.
EssenceMedia South Asia CEO Navin Khemka said advertisers are strongly considering the ICC CWC since it is happening in India and during the peak festive period. “The demand is not just for India matches but for the entire tournament. Clients should have, ideally, a holistic marketing plan if they want to get the desired results from a property like the ICC CWC,” he said.
Mediabrands India chief investment officer Hema Malik said traditional brands have taken centre stage for the ICC CWC, with brands from categories such as fast-moving consumer goods, auto, paints, banking, beverages and digital payments evincing much more interest. “ICC CWC will draw away a lot of festive ad spend since the tournament is in India. The Indian team's good performance will add to the momentum for the property,"" she said.
As reported by ET earlier, Star Sports has been seeking Rs 120 crore for co-presenting sponsorship and Rs 90 crore for associate sponsorship opportunities for the World Cup. The broadcaster is charging spot buyers Rs 31 lakh per 10-seconds for India and knockout matches.
Disney+ Hotstar priced its co-presenting sponsorship package at Rs 150 crore and Rs 75 crore for “powered by” sponsorship for the World Cup. The target for associate sponsorship is Rs 40 crore.
Advertisers who want to buy ad spots on mobile will have to fork out Rs 15 lakh per 10 seconds for the World Cup, and for Connected TV (CTV), the streamer is asking for Rs 4 lakh per 10 seconds for the World Cup. The cost per mille (CPM) for mid-roll ads is Rs 500 per 10 seconds for the India matches and Rs 230 per 10 seconds for others.

Tata Play steps out of India with a solution that global OTTs need,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/tata-play-steps-out-of-india-with-a-solution-that-global-otts-need/articleshow/103980286.cms,27-09-2023,"In an industry-first move,
Tata Play
has ventured out of India with a white label solution for global OTT aggregators, starting with a project collaboration with Philippines’ leading Pay-Tv provider Cignal TV.
India’s leading content distribution platform today launched the Tata Play Binge PaaS for OTT aggregators across the globe, enabling Tata Play to provide end-to-end development and deployment opportunities.

While the Indian company started with Philippines’ Cignal TV, Nagpal told ET Online that the company is actively engaged in talks with many other players across the world who are keen to take Tata Play's tech solution to evolve into OTT aggregators.
""We are having conversations with many potential aggregators across the world. It is not limited to one continent or one part of the world. Since this is on the cloud you can service Africa, South America, South Asia, Europe, anywhere,"" said Nagpal.
Tata Play Binge has about nearly a million subscribers on it now and there have been huge learnings in terms of technology, in terms of user interface, in terms of experience and everything else, Nagpal said, adding that across the world many players were struggling to find such solution, which Tata Play will now offer.
""Every country is trying the same things. So, we said, since we have the backend already and we have spent the money, time and effort in building the solution, then why not we become the backend for somebody who wants to aggregate anywhere in the world,"" the official said.
While this is a start, Nagpal believes the new tech solution offered by them to the world may take some to be an acceptable way of watching on OTTs.
However, the solution also offers economies of scale to all OTT players that come under one roof and is a win-win for all stakeholders including Tata Play, who gets to charge a fee for the tech solution it is providing.
While there is a general lull in paid TV subscribers, according to various research reports, the OTT market is fast evolving to be a lucrative one with rising user base. Tata's entry into the global market with the PaaS solution thus comes at an opportune time that may help the company add incremental revenues or even get a first-mover advantage.
Also, if aggregation becomes a worldwide phenomenon and more people see the benefits of an aggregated single subscription, single screen, single contact kind of a product, then Tata Play can perhaps benefit if it can capture more markets.

, MD and chief executive, Tata Communications, also said there is still time for 5G enterprise use cases in India to be adopted at scale.
""Currently, around 80% of the enterprise use cases can be executed on 4G LTE networks, and the remaining 20% need 5G. I think the task ahead of us is to convince enterprises to adopt those 80% use cases first, show them the RoI (returns on investment) and then graduate them to adopt 5G,"" he said.
He added that while there are a lot of use cases for 5G enterprise in theory, the device ecosystem on factory and plant locations needs to mature and reach a sizeable amount of 5G compatible devices for there to be meaningful adoption.
Speaking on the company's media and entertainment services (
MES
) business unit, which has grown by 20-25% over the past couple of years, Lakshminarayanan said the Tata Group company will continue investing in building its portfolio to keep the growth momentum.

“The record viewership for India and non-India matches in Asia Cup sets the stage for fandom to touch new highs during ICC CWC 2023 and for previous records to be challenged,” he further said.
Asia Cup 2023 was not just about on-field heroics; it was a complete cricketing experience that brought fans closer to the game they adore. Star Sports went the extra mile to provide viewers with exclusive behind-the-scenes access to Team India, said the company.
The inaugural match of the ICC World Cup 2023 will be played between England and New Zealand on October 5. India will play its first match against Australia on October 8.

Paramount realises $168 million in non-cash gain from Viacom18 stake dilution,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/paramount-realises-168-million-in-non-cash-gain-from-viacom18-stake-dilution/articleshow/103829220.cms,21-09-2023,"Paramount Global
has realised non-cash gain of $168 million for the quarter ended June from dilution of its stake in Indian
media conglomerate
Viacom18, the company said in its quarterly regulatory filing recently.
In April, the company's stake in Viacom18 dropped to 13% from 49% following a strategic transaction that saw Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) owned entities and Uday Shankar and James Murdoch's
Bodhi Tree
Systems investing Rs 15,145 crore in the company.
“Accordingly, we no longer account for it under the equity method,” Paramount said in its filing.
In April, Viacom18 received a cash infusion of Rs 15,145 crore after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the strategic transaction involving RIL, Bodhi Tree Systems, and Paramount Global.
According to the agreement, which also saw Shankar appointed to the board of Viacom18, RIL group entities received 82.2% of the compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) of Viacom18 in exchange for an investment of Rs 10,839 crore and the transfer of Jio Cinema from RIL subsidiary Reliance Storage Ltd to the media company.
Live Events
Bodhi Tree Systems was allotted the remaining 17.8% of the CCPS for its Rs 4,306 crore investment. It had raised funding from INQ Holding LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).
On conversion of the CCPS, RIL group entities had a 60.37% shareholding in Viacom18, while Bodhi Tree Systems' stake stood at 13.08%. TV18 holds a 13.54% stake and Paramount Global 13.01%.
Viacom18 originally began as a 51:49 JV between Network18-owned TV18 and Paramount, which was earlier known as
Viacom
.
During the company’s Q1 2022 earnings call, Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish said the Indian media business is fundamentally attractive, already has scale, and has a bright future.
“We really like Viacom 18. It’s the model we like; it has broad reach television networks, including the market-leading Colors brand, combined with a film business, a Hindi film business; it's both national and regional; and of course, it has streaming assets as well, all underpinned by a strong local content engine,” Bakish had stated.
“The second thing is that our core partner there is Reliance. That’s arguably the strongest and most powerful company in India, and they also own the telecom market leader, Jio. So, we think that’s great. Viacom18 is set up to be an even bigger player in the market, including in streaming,” he had said.
Industry watchers say that Paramount had to dilute its holding in Viacom18 since it could not inject the capital required for the media company's ambitious sports and digital projects.
Subsequently, Bodhi Tree Systems bought an additional 2.89% stake through a secondary transaction in Viacom18 from RIL for Rs 953.23 crore. The latest transaction valued Viacom18 at Rs 32,983 crore.
The stake acquisition followed NBC Universal, which is controlled by Comcast Corporation, and Tikehau Capital, a worldwide alternative asset management, investing $150 million in Bodhi Tree.
Bodhi Tree's holding in Viacom18 has increased to 15.97% following the latest stake buy. In April, the company had a 13.08% stake in Viacom18.

I&B sends cable companies request seeking autonomy in bouquet pricing to Trai,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ib-sends-cable-companies-request-seeking-autonomy-in-bouquet-pricing-to-trai/articleshow/103791445.cms,19-09-2023,"The
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
has requested the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) to include the issue of granting autonomy to TV distributors in bouquet formation by allowing them to break broadcaster bouquets, in its consultation paper that was issued on August 8, people in the know told ET.
The ministry sent a reference to the broadcasting sector regulator, following a request by the
All India Digital Cable Federation
(AIDCF) seeking its intervention in the matter.
The issue has the potential to snowball into a turf war between the government and the regulator, as TV channel pricing falls under Trai's domain.
In a letter to the Trai secretary, the ministry asked the regulator to positively consider the request of the AIDCF, which had filed a submission to the ministry after Trai decided not to include this issue in the consultation paper.
A Trai official told ET that its legal team is studying the ministry letter, and that the regulator will make a decision based on the opinion of the legal team. ""As a regulator, Trai doesn't need to respond to every letter that it receives,"" he added.

Under the Trai's new tariff order (NTO) regime, distributors are not allowed to break broadcaster bouquets and must offer them to consumers without making any changes. This allows broadcasters to create bouquets in such a way that their driver channels get maximum reach.
Prior to the implementation of the NTO, distributors were free to create their own bouquets as the content deals with broadcasters happened on a fixed fee basis.
Under the NTO, broadcasters charge MRP for a la carte channels and bouquets directly from consumers while the distributors act as intermediaries between consumers and the broadcasters.
In its representation to the ministry, the AIDCF, which is the apex body of cable TV service providers, said consumers will have to pay 21% less subscription charges every month if the distributors are allowed to break the broadcast bouquets.
The federation also wrote to Trai on August 17, asking it to publish a comprehensive consultation paper that covers all the important concerns pertaining to the TV distribution sector.

Disney said to be in talks with RIL over future of its India business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-india-sale-talks-said-to-draw-firms-including-reliance/articleshow/103758375.cms,19-09-2023,"The Walt Disney Co is believed to have held talks with
Reliance Industries
(RIL), which also owns a majority stake in Viacom18, at a time when the American media conglomerate is looking at various strategic options for its India business, people aware of the development told ET.
Two topmost leaders in both companies have had a direct discussion recently, said the sources. Bloomberg reported on Monday that Disney has held preliminary talks with potential buyers for its India business, including RIL. Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that the American media conglomerate is considering strategic options for its India business. Star India declined comment.
“As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours. Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis,” an RIL spokesperson said.
“We have made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance with our obligations under Securities Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 and our agreements with the stock exchanges.”
Under chief executive officer Bob Iger, Disney is reportedly considering multiple options for its India business, which include a joint venture (JV) with a strategic partner or an outright sale of Star India's TV channels and Disney+ Hotstar
streaming
platform.

While experts believe that the coming together of Star India and Viacom18 would be a gamechanging move in the Indian media and entertainment (M&E) industry, they add that the decline in the company's digital business, Disney+ Hotstar, due to the loss of Indian Premier League (IPL) digital and India bilateral
cricket
media rights coupled with the massive sports rights liabilities (over $4 billion) could prove to be a dampener in putting together a deal.
Since Star India is a costly asset and there aren't enough companies in the Indian M&E market with the appetite for an acquisition of this scale, experts said it won't be simple for Disney to find a strategic partner or buyer for the company other than RIL.
The M&E market in India is getting consolidated further with Sony Pictures Networks India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd in the process of merging their businesses to create a $10 billion media behemoth. Even as Star India is facing challenges in its digital and sports businesses, the company's TV entertainment business continues to perform well.
The network currently boasts a market share of close to 30% of the broadcast entertainment market.
Star India's net profit for 2021-22 zoomed 74% from the previous year to Rs 1,421 crore, while revenue from operations surged 38% from the previous fiscal to Rs 17,481 crore.
In the nine months to June 2023, Disney+ Hotstar lost close to 21 million subscribers due to the loss of IPL digital rights and the non-renewal of content deals with HBO.
Analysts tracking the OTT sector believe that the loss of India's bilateral cricket media rights will also deal a massive blow to Disney+ Hotstar's subscriber base.
RIL-owned Viacom18, which also has former Star India CEO Uday Shankar and former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch as shareholders, has strengthened its position in the sports business by acquiring digital rights of properties like IPL besides India bi-lateral cricket, Indian Super League (ISL), Cricket South Africa and Olympics 2024 media rights.
Viacom18's expansion in sports has come at the expense of Star India, which earlier owned the TV and digital rights to all the important cricket properties.
The company has also acquired premium Hollywood content from HBO and NBCUniversal. HBO content was earlier streamed on Disney+ Hotstar.
JioCinema, the company's streaming service, has also gained prominence in the Indian video streaming market by offering premium sports and entertainment for free to consumers.

AIDCF moves TDSAT against free cricket streaming by Star India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/aidcf-moves-tdsat-against-free-cricket-streaming-by-star-india/articleshow/103738945.cms,17-09-2023,"The All India Digital Cable Federation (
AIDCF
) has asked the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (
TDSAT
) to order
Star India
to cease Disney+ Hotstar's free cricket stream, arguing that the customers served by its members are also demanding live cricket for free.
The federation has filed a petition before the TDSAT against the Walt Disney-owned company's decision to offer the just-concluded Asia Cup and the upcoming ICC Men's Cricket World Cup for free to mobile users through its streaming platform, Disney+ Hotstar.
The tribunal has issued a notice to Star India and asked it to file a reply by October 3. On TV, Star India is airing the matches on the
Star Sports
network, which is a paid broadcasting platform.
Star India couldn't be reached for comment.
ET was the first to report June 9 that Disney+ Hotstar will offer the Asia Cup and World Cup free to customers. Earlier, JioCinema had offered the Indian Premier League free to all internet users in the country. The platform plans to keep sports free as it looks to scale up its business.

In its petition, the federation has contended that the broadcaster is discriminating between sets of consumers by charging cable TV subscribers for the same content while offering it free to Disney+ Hotstar users.
It noted that charging for the same content on TV while making it free online goes against the
Telecom Regulatory Authority
of India's regulatory framework, which aims to establish a comprehensive environment that ensures transparency and non-discrimination, and subscriber safety.
The federation contended that free streaming will have an adverse impact on the businesses of its members like
GTPL Hathway
,
DEN Networks
,
Siti Networks
, and Hathway Digital as pay TV customers migrate to OTT.
The total paid subscriber base of TV distribution platforms dropped by 5 million to 120 million in 2022, according to the FICCI-EY report. Cable TV witnessed the biggest drop, with its subscriber base dropping by 4 million to 64 million.
The AIDCF also stated that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's Downlinking Guidelines restrict broadcasters from providing their services and content directly to customers except in the manner prescribed therein.
""It is trite law that when a particular act is prescribed under a statute or any policy or guidelines stemming from and arising out of a statute, then such act must be done in the prescribed manner or not at all. Clearly, the respondent (Star India) is attempting to blatantly flout such a mandate, and the actions thus do not confirm the mandatory requirements of their licenses and permissions and the U&D Guidelines, 2022,"" the AIDCF said in its appeal.

(MIB) is planning to come out with the Broadcasting Services Regulation (BSR) Bill 2023, which, once it becomes law, will replace the current Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation who spoke to ET.
While the
CTN Act
1995 primarily regulates the content and operation of cable TV networks, the BSR Bill will have a considerably larger scope as it will govern over-the-top (
OTT
), cable TV, direct-to-home (
DTH
), headend-in-the-sky (HITS), internet protocol television (IPTV), and
radio
.
The MIB became the nodal ministry for OTT content and digital news platforms in 2020.

""Broadcasting Services Regulation will replace the CTN Act of 1995. However, the process will take time as we will have to first put up the draft bill for public consultation. The bill will be made public either in October or November,"" an MIB official said on condition of anonymity.
According to the draft of the bill accessed by ET, a broadcaster has been defined as a person who provides programming services and has been granted registration under Section 5 for uplinking or downlinking of programmes.

OTT has been defined as a broadcasting service that is made available on-demand or live to users in India, where a curated catalogue of programmes is owned by, licensed to, or contracted to be transmitted over the internet or a computer resource that is not a closed network, and where additional hardware such as a set-top box or dongle is required to access content on a non-smart device.
The bill clarifies that the OTT services will not include a social media intermediary as defined in the Information Technology Act 2000.
The bill has three parts, with the first part applying to broadcasters and cable and satellite broadcasting networks. The second and third parts deal with radio and internet broadcasting, respectively.
Every programme or advertisement will have to conform with the
Advertising and Programme Code
, as may be prescribed. Besides, different programme and advertising codes may be prescribed for linear, OTT, and radio broadcasting.
The violation of advertising and programme codes will attract fines ranging from ₹5,000 to ₹10 lakh. The government might also ask TV channels to issue an apology or direct the channel to be taken off-air depending on the nature of the violation.
The bill also prescribes fines and imprisonment for cable TV, DTH, HITS, OTT, radio, broadcasting, and audience measurement service providers who operate without registration. The fine ranges from ₹10,000 to ₹20 lakh, while the imprisonment ranges from two to five years.
To ensure compliance with the advertising and programme codes, the bill prescribes a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism - self-regulation by the platform, a self-regulatory industry body, and a Broadcast Advisory Council having 11 members from government and civil society.
The council will have one eminent independent person with 15 years of experience in media and entertainment, besides five officers drawn from the central government ministries like I&B, Women & Child Development, Home Affairs, External Affairs, and Social Justice & Empowerment. The council will also include five eminent personalities nominated by the central government from multiple fields.
The violation of advertising and programme codes will attract fines ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10 lakh. The government might also ask TV channels to issue an apology or direct the channel to be taken off-air depending on the nature of the violation.
The bill also prescribes fines and imprisonment for cable TV, DTH, HITS, OTT, radio, broadcasting, and audience measurement service providers who operate without registration. The fine ranges from Rs 10,000 to Rs 20 lakh, while the improvement ranges from two to five years.
The government will also have the power to confiscate the equipment of broadcasting networks or services that violate the broadcasting regulation law.

Disney to cut target for Disney+ streaming subscribers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-to-cut-target-for-disney-streaming-subscribers/articleshow/103676314.cms,15-09-2023,"Walt Disney Co
. expects to fall tens of millions of
subscribers
short of its last publicly stated 2024 target for the Disney+
streaming service
, according to people familiar with the matter.
The goal of 215 million to 245 million subscribers was set in August 2022 by then-Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek. In February, returning CEO
Bob Iger
said
Disney
would no longer provide subscriber forecasts, matching a decision at Netflix Inc.
Disney+ has been losing customers to price increases, as well as collapsing demand in India after the company failed to win cricket streaming rights. That’s led management to conclude it will fall short of those earlier numbers, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal targets.
Wall Street’s focus in the past year has shifted from sign-up numbers at online video platforms to profitability, and
Disney
has narrowed its losses in its streaming division by hundreds of millions of dollars in recent quarters.
Bloomberg
Live Events
Price increases have helped. Iger has raised the price of Disney+ since its launch in 2019 as part of an effort to reach profitability in the streaming business as early as next year.
Shares of Disney rose 1.2% to $84.48 at the close in New York. Earlier Thursday, Bloomberg News reported that Nexstar Media Group Inc. and broadcast entrepreneur Byron Allen have separately expressed interest in buying Disney’s ABC network and local TV stations.
The company is still seeking to increase customers to Disney+. A deal announced this week with Charter Communications Inc., the No. 2 US cable provider, will package Disney+ with the Spectrum TV service, adding millions of new customers. Disney will receive a reduced, wholesale price for those subscribers.
In 2020, it set a target for as many as 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024 for Disney+ and the Hotstar product in India, before lowering the target last year.
The company finished its fiscal third quarter with 146.1 million Disney+ subscribers.

SAT
was hearing Zee's plea against Sebi's order baring Zee Entertainment Enterprises'
Punit Goenka
and
Subhash Chandra
from holding any key managerial positions in the company and other organisations for allegedly siphoning off funds of the media firm.
""There is no certainty that these eight months won't be extended. ...past record of Sebi is that they have always extended it (investigation),"" SAT observed after hearing the Securities Exchange Board of India's (Sebi's) counsel Darius Khambata.
Khambata in his argument stated ""...they waive contracts, which ZEEL had with these companies ...that's it. ...they did not mention what are the services they availed, the consideration for the same... nothing. You (Goenka) are in control of these companies and you don't think you should offer an explanation. ...it is your burden to establish it.""
Khambata further stated that the fact that ZEEL saying it will not explain and it doesn't have to explain is critical.
""They are not able to dislodge the interconnection, the proximity of time, the proximity of the amounts and the conduit between the three promoter companies, which clearly show the undisputed facts,"" he added.

ZEEL said that the Sebi order is critical to the Zee-Sony merger, but the shareholders voted for the merger and not for Goenka, he added.
Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Punit Goenka, said that ZEEL admits to the transactions and they were official transactions.
He questioned that if Sebi found it suspicious then why was it kept suspended for eight months.
Singhvi further said, ""Sebi's action is 'punitive not preventive' what is the telling urgency to freeze me... Where is the proof? Why am I being barred at this stage before the investigation is concluded ?""
Today the transactions show no loss to ZEEL nor any gain to Goenka, he said.
He added, Goenka is critical for the merger as
Sony
, a foreign entity, wants support during the transition phase.
""Goenka being in the industry for 10-15 years understands the market,"" he added.
Singhvi also said the Sebi's order is against the public interest considering a merger with Sony, which has been approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
SAT will continue to hear the matter on September 27.
In June, SAT refused to give any interim relief to Chandra and his son Punit Goenka after the market regulator barred them from holding any key managerial position in any listed company.
Following this, Zee Entertainment Enterprises challenged the Sebi order at SAT.
Meanwhile, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in August 10 gave its approval to the merger of Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Culver Max Entertainment (earlier known as Sony Pictures Networks India) creating a USD 10-billion media house, the biggest in the country.

Before the rains disrupted the match today, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul both scored centuries to pile 356 runs for India with the loss of just two wickets.
Perhaps, the excitement that the key contest between India and Pakistan offers is pretty weak against the several rain 'irritations', because the OTT platform managed to score a record concurrency despite several interruptions.
The arch rivals are set to play against each other again in World Cup and these games are usually a big crowd-puller. Media experts had also said earlier that matches involving Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are expected to see a scale equivalent to an India-Pakistan match in the World Cup, which may help Disney+ Hotstar to keep scorers busy counting its viewership on TV and digital platforms.
Disney+ Hotstar is also streaming Asia Cup for free on mobile or handheld devices. They will also stream World Cup on these devices for free.
This also comes at a time when Disney Star is up against Reliance-owned Viacom18, which has emerged as a strong competitor who bagged the digital rights for IPL while the former kept the TV rights. Viacom18's JioCinema also recently won the media rights for all Indian cricket teams' (men and women) home matches.
Disney Star on other hand retains media rights for ICC's matches.

Before that, appearing for World Crest, Senior Counsel Navroz Seervai along with law firm ANB Legal argued that the pledgee has only a 'special interest' in the pledged goods, but YES Bank has repeatedly sought to exercise rights of ownership, including voting rights in respect of the shares, which is contrary to the statutory law and judicial pronouncements.
Countering this, Senior Advocate Darius Khambata and Gathi Prakash of law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, appearing for YES Bank and JC Flowers, argued that voting rights have been expressly conferred on the pledgee, both under the pledge deeds and under the POAs (Powers of Attorney).

"BCCI Media Rights: Viacom18 creates monopoly; wins bid for five years at Rs 5,963 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/bcci-media-rights-viacom18-creates-monopoly-wins-for-cricket-games-for-five-years-at-rs-5963-crore/articleshow/103301856.cms,02-09-2023,"Viacom18, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries has secured exclusive media rights for international and domestic matches by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for a cumulative figure of Rs 5,963 crore for the next five years between September 2023-March 2028, said the company through its statement.
Earlier, BCCI had issued an Invitation to Tender (ITT) after which an e-auction was conducted on August 31, 2023, wherein all eligible bidders were permitted to participate to determine the successful bidder for the Media Rights.
The media rights tender by the governing body was floated for five years (2023-28), covering 88 matches. At Rs 45 crore per match, the overall base price worked out to Rs 3,960 crore.
“Live sports consumption in India has sharply pivoted towards digital, and winning the global digital rights will help us further fuel this ascendancy. Additionally, winning the broadcast rights is an extension of our strategy as we will continue to serve quality and affordable content to all viewers as they continue to migrate from linear TV to digital screens,” Viacom18 Sports CEO, Anil Jayaraj said on the company winning rights for
BCCI games
.
After winning rights, the media house will have rights for tournaments such as International Men’s and Women’s matches, and domestic first-class competitions like the Ranji Trophy, Duleep Trophy, Deodhar Trophy, and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, among others.
Live Events
Viacom18 will expand its current media rights portfolio as it already has tournaments like TATA IPL, TATA WPL, Olympics 2024, SA20, Major League Cricket (MLC), Ultimate Table Tennis (UTT), NBA, Diamond League, World Athletics Championships Budapest 2023, MotoGP, LALIGA, Ligue1, Serie A, BGIS (E-Sports), Abu Dhabi T10, FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, and top BWF events.
In the last bid by BCCI, back in 2018, Star Sports India had outbid Viacom18 and Sony to win media rights, for both television and digital platforms, for Rs 6138.1 crore. The rights were for the period of 2018 to 2023.

PVR Inox's August collections hit a new monthly high,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/pvr-inoxs-august-collections-hit-a-new-monthly-high/articleshow/103294069.cms,02-09-2023,"India's largest cinema exhibition company
PVR Inox
recorded its single biggest box office month of all time in August with a gross box office revenue of ₹532 crore across its theatres in the country, proving cinema continues to be the most popular mode of outdoor entertainment notwithstanding the talks of over-the-top (OTT) platforms taking over the film industry.
The company said August saw the highest-ever monthly admissions of nearly 19 million guests thronging to PVR Inox theatres, driven by the blockbuster performances of 'Gadar 2', 'OMG2', 'Dreamgirl 2' (Hindi), '
Jailer
' (
Tamil
) and the continuing success of July releases like 'Rocky aur Rani ki
Prem Kahani
' (Hindi) and '

PVR Inox said August 15 recorded the highest-ever admissions and box office in a single day, surpassing the previous best figures achieved on August 13.

Viacom18 picks up BCCI media rights for ₹ 5.9kcr,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/viacom18-picks-up-bcci-media-rights-for-5-9kcr/articleshow/103262251.cms,01-09-2023,"Mumbai : Reliance Industries-owned Viacom18 has won the TV and digital rights to the
BCCI
’s international bilateral cricket matches held in India as well as domestic competitions for ₹5,963 crore for a period of five years to 2028.
The bid, however, is lower by ₹175 crore than the ₹6,138 crore
Disney Star
had paid for the previous fiveyear cycle, a sign that the value of bilateral cricket will be under pressure due to declining viewer interest in the Test and ODI formats.
It translates to a payout of ₹67.76 crore per match, about 10% higher than in the previous cycle that had more matches.
BCCI secretary
Jay Shah
said Thursday's e-auction has propelled BCCI into the upper echelons of permatch media rights valuation. “Throughout this process, we have steadfastly upheld the principles of transparency and fairness, ensuring that all stakeholders are treated equitably,” he said.
Sources close to the development said Viacom18 bid ₹3,101 crore for digital rights and ₹2,862 crore for TV rights, with the difference between the two sets of rights being a mere ₹239 crore.

They added that
Sony
Pictures Networks India (SPNI) was the only other bidder in the fray as Disney Star sat out of the e-auction, having already committed $4.5 billion for Indian Premier League (
IPL
) TV rights and
International Cricket Council
(ICC) digital rights.
One of the sources said Sony's bid of ₹5,863 crore was ₹100 crore lower than Viacom18's bid. While the general feeling was that Sony would bid aggressively for TV while Viacom18 would go big on digital, both parties bid aggressively for TV and digital rights.
In a statement, SPNI MD and CEO NP Singh said that the company's disciplined bid was grounded in market forecasts and a long-term growth strategy.
“Disney Star didn't participate in the e-auction as the acquisition of ICC rights for $3 billion has limited its ability to participate in bidding for other properties,” said a veteran media executive.
Media watchers say Disney Star has overpaid for the ICC rights even after accounting for the sub-licensing deal that the company later inked with
Zee Entertainment
for the TV rights.
“What was more surprising is the fact that Viacom18 bid aggressively for both the TV and the digital rights. They have publicly stated that they are focused on digital rights for cricket properties,” the executive added.
Explaining Viacom18's aggressive bidding for TV rights, an industry watcher said that the company has killed two birds with one stone.
The loss of BCCI TV rights will impact Disney Star's subscription revenue, as the company was booking an estimated subscription revenue of ₹2,500 crore from cricket and sports.
With the loss of BCCI rights and the fact that it will not have the ICC TV rights from next year, Disney Star will be over-dependent on the IPL, which takes place for only two months in a year, to mop up subscription revenue from TV distributors like Tata Play and Hathway Digital.
Secondly, Viacom18 has prevented Sony, which is in the process of merging with Zee Entertainment, from strengthening its position in the TV subscription market, as a combination of ICC and BCCI TV rights would have enabled the combined Sony-Zee entity to dial up their TV subscription revenue significantly.
Media Partners Asia VP Mihir Shah said BCCI media rights are vital for media players because they ensure year-round audience engagement and protect against the seasonality of other major tournaments like the IPL and even ICC events, which may not always have prime-time slots.
“Winning TV and digital rights for BCCI allows Viacom18 to offer the best of both mediums in terms of reach and targeting,” he added.
Kurate Digital senior partner Uday Sodhi said the big trend coming out of the sale of the BCCI rights is the steady change in cricket viewing habits among consumers.
“The value of T20 leagues like the IPL is increasing, and the value of Test matches is reducing. This will have a long-term impact on cricket as a game and the finances of the cricket boards. Cricket is changing, and it's showing in the value of the rights that broadcasters are paying for it,” he added.
The BCCI had set a base price of ₹45 crore per match, with the digital rights base price of ₹25 crore per match being more than the TV rights base of ₹20 crore per match. The board had reserved the right to call for a rebid in case the final consolidated bid went below ₹61 crore per match.

Essel Group in talks to sell its assets to pay off debts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/essel-group-in-talks-to-sell-its-assets-to-pay-off-debts/articleshow/103262347.cms,01-09-2023,"Media baron
Subhash Chandra
’s
Essel Group
is in talks with corporate houses, real estate developers, and leading private equity players for the sale of marquee land properties and a few unlisted infrastructure assets to generate ₹1,500 crore that he is supposed to pay American PE firm
JC Flowers
to settle his debt obligations and take back control of assets including direct-to-home (DTH) company
Dish TV
, said multiple banking and ibanking sources aware of the talks.
“The group has enough as sets to liquidate, pay off the settlement amount, get back whatever securities are pledged, and get free Dish TV and
Zee Learn
from JC Flowers. Dish TV's 24% stake would be valued around ₹800-900 crore,” said a banker. “The company is looking to close all transactions by Feb or March 2024.”
JC Flowers inherited a 24% stake in Dish TV from
Yes Bank
, which converted a loan into equity after the DTH company defaulted on a ₹5,400 crore loan. Essel Group promoters own a 15.05% stake in
Zee
Learn. The group is selling off its unlisted infrastructure assets, which are still with the group.
“The group hasn’t been able to unlock the value of those assets in the last 3–4 years, and the time is right for good realisation to get some equity value around those assets,” said an investment banker involved in the deal process.
The final agreement between Dr. Chandra and JC Flowers was signed on August 7th, 2023, and the promoter agreed to settle nearly ₹7,000 crore exposure, including all secured and unsecured debts with the firm.
Live Events
On August 8, Zee Learn informed exchanges that the company had signed a settlement agreement with
JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction
on August 7 to settle its obligations with respect to loans borrowed by certain trusts and entities.
“As per the settlement, the group would provide JC Flowers liquidity from its own sources. The firm has assigned a value to respective securities, whether they are properties, shares, or cash flow-backed assets of Zee Learn and other schools,” said the source privy to discussions.
“As and when the promoter raises the funds on a stage-wise basis, JC Flowers will release the properties and respective loans or even Dish TV shares.
The Essel Group promoter will not raise any loans for this transaction. They are looking to raise money by selling some assets and cleaning the slate, said the banker.
Sources in the banking industry say that the Essel Group promoter has been in settlement talks with almost all lenders since 2019.
The group had even reached out to Yes Bank for settlement in 2021 as well, but it wasn’t well received by the new board of Yes Bank and led to another round of litigation around Dish TV shares, some properties, and a personal letter of comfort given by Dr. Chandra at some point in time, said the source.
""Discussions started picking up pace after March 2023 after JC Flowers formed a new team, "" said the banker. What followed were intense discussions on their fund expectations and Dr. Chandra’s ability to pay,"" said a banker.

BCCI media rights

Reliance
and Sony to win the
BCCI
media rights, for both television and digital platforms, for Rs 6138.1 crore. The rights were for the period of 2018 to 2023.
""Bilateral series have been far and few due to busy calendar and have in the last few years losing context given the sliding viewership,"" a media industry source, who didn't wish to be identified, told ET Online.
Non-availability of marquee Indian players for all matches and the (varied) quality of opposition and mix of formats have not been helping the cause either, the source said.

Disney gambles on free cricket to turn the tables in India's streaming war
""Bilateral events have been a loss-making property for Disney Star,"" another source told ET Online.
Industry experts had earlier expressed views that media companies may have a cautious approach while bidding for BCCI media rights, considering that they have already committed $9 billion towards IPL and ICC rights. Moreoever, the companies are also entangled with other issues including potential mergers, stake rejig or spending hefty amounts to capture larger market share.
Elara Capital had earlier said The Indian cricket board may rake in Rs 6,500 crore to Rs 7,500 crore from selling the separate TV and digital rights for the national side's home games, but the base price this time was 25% lower per match than in the earlier cycle.
Elara Capital's analyst Karan Taurani said overall premiums (vs earlier cycle) for these rights are much lower vs IPL due to lower number of T20 matches, less interest in bilateral matches with a large tournament like IPL garnering interest on home grounds already, lesser number of platforms bidding for the same, and a poor ad environment over the last one year.

""IPL had attracted a premium of 117% on a per match basis vs it’s last cycle price, whereas these rights have come at a premium of mere 13% on a per match basis vs it’s last cycle’s price,"" he said.
Meanwhile, acquisition of BCCI bilateral rights will also enable
JioCinema
to become even bigger in the Indian OTT ecosystem. The platform has an AVOD market share of ~22-24% already in CY23 and after factoring IPL revenue and other content, revenues can scale up further due to these bilateral rights. This in turn will intensify competition in the OTT segment and work negatively for other broadcast-based OTT players such as Sony, Zee, Disney+Hotstar, he said.
Disney Star, that has an array of sports channels both in SD and HD format and offers commentary in regional languages, holds the rights to broadcast and stream matches on TV and on its digital platform for all ICC events. It also has the rights for the Asia Cup till this year. The broadcaster has been traditionally been a favourite choice for sports media rights, given its robust footprint, top technology and years of expertise.
Following the news that Star Sports will not be broadcasting Indian cricket team's home matches for the next five years, fans tweeted about their nostalgic connection with the brand.

The tribunal also scheduled for September 8 the hearing of Goenka's plea, challenging Sebi's confirmatory order barring him from holding any directorship or managerial position in any listed company or their subsidiaries.
Goenka, who is the MD and CEO of Zee, approached the appellate tribunal through law firm Economic Laws Practice. He has submitted that Sebi's order be set aside.
A division bench of Justice Tarun Agarwala and technical member Meera Swarup, while allowing Sebi to file its response, observed that it was not satisfied with the regulator's timeline of eight months to complete the probe against alleged wrongdoings by the Zee promoters.
The bench also referred to the merger deal between Zee and Culver Max Entertainment (Sony) that has received all the requisite approvals, including from the

""The merger has happened with the consensus of the shareholders. There is a public interest involved. If the public says he should be the director, then it does have a bearing,"" the tribunal observed in its oral remarks.
Before this, senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Goenka, argued that
Goenka
was a director since 2010 and no public interest would be prejudiced if he is made a director. ""The merged company has a different paradigm, and there is no chance that he can harm shareholders, and the new entity will be under the control of Sony,"" argued Singhvi.
Sebi is probing allegations that Goenka and his father, Subhash Chandra, had diverted funds from Zee to other Essel Group companies without seeking board approval.
Rohit Jain, managing partner of law firm Singhania & Co, said: ""Till Sebi does not complete its probe against the alleged wrongdoings and comes out with clear findings against Punit Goenka, the order barring him from holding any position in the merged entity seems premature and legally untenable.""
However, Ashish K Singh, managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal, said given the fact that investigation is in advanced stages and a timeline has also been given by Sebi, there are very limited grounds for the appeal to be entertained.

Thompson, who left the Times in 2020 after eight years as that company's president and CEO, is credited with transforming it to a digital-first organization more dependent on paid subscribers than the collapsing advertising market that has doomed many newspapers. The England native was director-general of the BBC from 2004 to 2012.

ZEE Ent vs SEBI: SAT refuses interim relief to Punit Goenka; final order on September 8,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-ent-vs-sebi-sat-refuses-interim-relief-to-punit-goenka-final-order-on-september-8/videoshow/103220319.cms,30-08-2023,,media

Securities Appellate Tribunal
(
SAT
) on Wednesday directed the Securities & Exchange Board of India (
Sebi
) to file its response by September 4 in an appeal filed by
Punit Goenka
, the promoter of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
(
ZEEL
). The tribunal will now hear the matter on September 8.
Goenka, who is the MD and CEO of ZEEL, approached the appellate tribunal through the law firm Economic Laws Practice (ELP) to challenge the capital market regulator’s confirmatory order barring him from holding any directorship or managerial position in any listed company or their subsidiaries.
The ZEEL chief has submitted that the capital market regulator’s order be set aside.
The division bench, comprising Justice Tarun Agarwala and technical member Meera Swarup, while allowing Sebi to file its response by September 4, observed that it is not satisfied with Sebi’s timeline of eight months to complete the probe against the alleged wrongdoings by the ZEEL promoters.
The regulator had said in its order that it would complete the probe against ZEEL promoters within eight months from the order's issuance date.

Senior Advocate Darius Khambata is appearing for the Sebi in the case.
Last week, Goenka moved the SAT against the Sebi's confirmatory order that barred him and his father, Subhash Chandra Goenka, from holding directorships or managerial positions in any listed companies or their subsidiaries.
Earlier, the Goenkas had challenged the market regulator’s interim order dated June 12 before the SAT. However, the tribunal did not give any immediate relief.
This time, only Punit Goenka moved the SAT against the confirmatory order, according to multiple sources involved in the matter.
The development happens at a time when the merger deal between ZEEL and Culver Max Entertainment (Sony) has received all the requisite approvals, including from the
National Company Law Tribunal
, the Competition Commission of India, and the stock exchanges.
Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch's August 14 order prevents Punit Goenka from becoming the MD and CEO of the Sony-Zee combined entity until the regulator concludes its investigation in an alleged fund-diversion case against the father-son duo. They are accused of diverting funds from Zee to other Essel Group companies without seeking board approval.

"SAT refuses interim relief to Zee's Punit Goenka in SEBI case, next hearing on Sept 8",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sat-refuses-interim-relief-to-punit-goenka-in-zee-sebi-case-to-hear-case-on-sept-8/articleshow/103199917.cms,30-08-2023,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (
SAT
) on Wednesday refused to provide an interim relief to
Punit Goenka
, former chief of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
, in
SEBI
case, reported ET NOW.
It has given time to markets regulator, SEBI, till September 4, 2023, to file a reply on the matter. The next hearing has been scheduled for September 8, 2023.
Goenka had moved the SAT against a SEBI order barring him from holding key positions in four
Zee
group firms and in the merged entity of ZEEL and
Sony
Pictures Networks India. The case pertains to a SEBI order alleging that Goenka and his father
Subhash Chandra
, former chairman of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), abused their position as directors or Key Managerial Personnel (KMPs) of a listed company by siphoning off funds for their own benefit.
Goenka had moved SAT challenging SEBI's confirmatory order that was passed on August 14, whereby the regulator restrained the duo from holding the post of director or KMP in at least four Zee group companies as well as in the merged entity of ZEEL and Sony Pictures Networks India, until further directions.
Besides, Goenka was restrained from becoming the managing director of the merged entity.
Live Events
The deal is yet to be complete.
The appellate tribunal has listed the matter for hearing on August 30, an update with the SAT showed.
Passing the confirmatory order in connection with the case of alleged siphoning off funds of ZEEL, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had said investigation by the watchdog in the case ""shall be completed in a time-bound manner and in any event, within a period of eight months"".
In the interim order passed in June this year, Chandra and Goenka were barred from becoming a director or KMP in any listed company but that direction has been modified now.
The interim order was challenged by the two individuals before SAT, which had rejected their pleas.
On August 10, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the merger of ZEEL and Culver Max Entertainment, which is doing business as Sony Pictures Networks India.

Advertisers drive hard bargain with Disney Star on Asia Cup,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/advertisers-drive-hard-bargain-with-disney-star-on-asia-cup/articleshow/103185060.cms,30-08-2023,"Disney Star
has been facing difficulty selling ad slots for the
Asia Cup
as
advertisers
seek more competitive pricing, citing fewer appealing matches. The absence of new-age advertisers and curtailed ad spends by gaming companies against the backdrop of the 28% GST levy by the government are also headwinds.
Established brands, which find the current pricing of cricket's ad inventory prohibitive, are seeking more bang for their buck, forcing Disney Star to slash advertising rates on TV as well as digital.
Media buyers say advertisers are conserving ad budgets since they feel the ICC Cricket World Cup is a better bet due to its scheduling right in the middle of the festive season. Even brands that have invested in the Asia Cup have only committed a smaller outlay, they added.
The six-nation tournament featuring India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Nepal will kick off on Wednesday.
While the company has set an internal target of ₹500-600 crore from both TV and digital, senior media executives said the network has commitments of ₹150-200 crore from advertisers, with digital being slightly ahead of TV.

One of the executives said the company is seeking ₹3-4 lakh per 10 seconds for TV spots and has, so far, sold 30-40% of its inventory. On digital, it has started wooing small and medium businesses to advertise for as low as ₹49 CPMs, he added.
Disney declined to comment on the story.
Reportedly, brands such as Thums Up, Nerolac Paint, Amazon Pay, Jindal Panther, My11Circle,
MRF
, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, and Wild Stone have signed up with Disney Star as advertisers for the Asia Cup.
""Initially, there was inertia among the advertisers regarding the ad rates of Disney Star,"" said Madison Media Alpha and Madison Digital CEO Vishal Chinchankar, while noting that there will still be unsold inventory left since advertisers are weighing their options between the Asia Cup and the ICC World Cup.
Omnicom Media Group
India chief growth officer Anand Chakravarthy said there is more scrutiny among advertisers for properties like the Asia Cup, unlike the IPL.
""The Asia Cup is happening before the festive season, and the format of the tournament also doesn't guarantee sustained viewership across all matches. Clients, therefore, have to pick and choose and be smart about their investments. That is the reason it has been relatively slow advertising because clients are taking a lot more considered decisions before going ahead and investing,"" he added.
Chinchankar added that many of the clients have set aside a sizeable portion of their budgets for the ICC World Cup and some for the Asia Cup. ""There will be a lot of last-minute inventory sales, as a lot hinges on the viewership of the first few games,"" he added.
As reported by ET earlier, Star Sports was seeking outlays of Rs 20–26 crore from sponsors. For spot buyers, the company's asking price was Rs 25 lakh per 10 seconds for India vs. Pakistan as well as the final match. Disney+ Hotstar was eyeing outlays of Rs 12–30 crore, besides a CPM rate of Rs 500 for India matches and Rs 230 for all matches from spot buyers.
Disney Star will air the matches on Star Sports and Star Gold, while Disney+ Hotstar will stream the matches for free to mobile users. On TV, the network hopes to attain a reach of 450 million. By keeping the Asia Cup free on mobile, it hopes to tap into the 450 million-strong smartphone user base.

Disney gambles on free cricket to turn the tables in India's streaming war,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-gambles-on-free-cricket-to-turn-the-tables-in-india-streaming-war/articleshow/103157644.cms,29-08-2023,"Walt
Disney
is attempting to revive the fortunes of its streaming business in India by offering free cricket on smartphones, betting that the strategy will boost
advertising
revenue and offset the impact of a subscriber exodus.
The India streaming operations, which were Disney's biggest last year globally by users, posted a loss of $41.5 million on revenue of $390 million for the year to March 2022, its last disclosed results.
With subscriber exits accelerating and slashing the user base by a third between October last year and July, the Burbank-headquartered entertainment giant's financial performance in the country is only expected to come under more pressure.
Disney's woes are a cautionary tale about the Indian market where expectations about a swelling middle-class are often frustrated by deeply cost-conscious consumers.
The company acquired Indian streaming service Hotstar when it paid $71 billion for some 21st Century Fox global assets in 2019. With the streaming rights of the Indian Premier League (
IPL
), the world's richest cricket league, in the bag, Disney made cricket on Hotstar a paid service in 2020 and was confident about garnering up to 100 million users within years.

But Indian billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
snatched IPL rights away in a $2.9 billion bid last year, and then streamed games for free. Soon, Disney subscribers fled - out of 61 million users in October, roughly 21 million had left by July.
Disney internally recognises it misjudged Indians' willingness to pay - people signed up for Hotstar when it had IPL, but didn't stick around to buy more premium plans to watch other content, two Disney sources told Reuters.
""We were bullish on Indian subscribers' propensity to pay. That's not worked out,"" said one of the sources. ""Free cricket is the only bullet left.""
The company will stream live matches of the Asia Cup from Aug. 30 as well as the World Cup in October-November that users of 600 million smartphones in the cricket-mad nation can watch without paying anything.
The new strategy comes as Disney is also exploring options of finding a joint venture partner or even a sale of its India business.
'HYBRID MODEL'
Disney renewed its rights to show the International Cricket Council's tournaments in India from 2024 to 2027 by paying around $3 billion. It retains digital streaming rights but last year licensed the TV broadcast rights to Indian's
Zee Entertainment
for around $1.5 billion, a source said.
The company has assessed that going back to the free-cricket model on mobile phones and tablets is the strategic pivot needed to shore up revenues. It calls the move a new ""hybrid model"" to drive advertising revenues by raising smartphone viewers, while targeting new subscribers for the Hotstar TV app where cricket will remain under paid plans.
This strategy is about ""how we build a model which will allow us to drive two revenue streams more meaningfully,"" Sajith Sivanandan, head of Disney+ Hotstar, said in an interview, adding Disney was confident its user base will grow in the years ahead.
Making cricket free on mobile will help ""450 million-plus customers to tune in"" over 48 days of the 50-over World Cup that is being hosted by India, compared to 300 million in the last World Cup in 2019, stated a ""Festival of Cricket 2023"" Disney presentation created for advertisers and seen by Reuters.
The company is eyeing a new record of 50 million concurrent viewership during the World Cup, double the 2019 number, the document added. That will also be 56% higher than what Ambani's JioCinema clocked during this year's IPL finals in May.
Sivanandan said the company would target advertisers with budgets as low as 200,000 rupees ($2,421). Another new initiative would be interactive ads connecting watchers to a brand's WhatsApp chat to enable purchases of the products.
The Disney document showed a new deal struck with Coca-Cola for boosting subscriptions. QR codes on an estimated 400 million Coke bottles will offer a Hotstar trial, with Disney hoping 80,000 people will then take paid plans.
LOW AVERAGE REVENUE
There is no guarantee, though, that Disney's strategy pivot will succeed.
Daoud Jackson, a senior analyst specialising in streaming businesses at UK research firm Omdia, said free cricket was not a sure shot winner as companies pay billions of dollars to get streaming rights but commensurate advertising revenue takes many years to materialise.
While India's middle class is massive, the broad user base in the world's most populous country ""narrows sharply"" when it comes to paying users, VC firm Blume Ventures said in April.
In the United States, ad-free Disney+ streaming service subscription rates are set to rise by 27% to $13.99 per month. By contrast in India, Disney+ Hotstar service costs $3.62 a month.
The average revenue per user (ARPU) is very low in India at just $0.59, compared to Disney+ U.S. service's $7.31, according to Disney's latest quarterly earnings report.
Disney's global leadership has put pressure on India to speed up the ""path to profitability"" for Hotstar. CEO Bob Iger's Chief of Staff, Nancy Lee, visited the country earlier this year and questioned the business leaders if streaming operations can be profitable before the end-2024 global target, sources said.
She was told advancing of the target will not be possible.
Still, research firm Media Partners Asia estimated last year India's streaming market will be worth $7 billion by 2027, where Netflix and Amazon.com's Prime Video will also be competing. But it is the rivalry with JioCinema, run by Ambani's broadcast unit Viacom18, that could be the most intense.
As Ambani promoted IPL on his streaming apps around March, he focused on how people can watch matches on the go on smartphones, and do not need a TV. To counter that, Disney at the time rolled out ads saying cricket was best watched on TV - for which it still has IPL rights.
In new ad campaigns last week, Disney changed tack.
""Now watch all matches of the world's biggest tournaments, anywhere, on your mobile, absolutely free,"" it said.

Editors Guild voices concern over Karnataka govt decision to set up fact-check unit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/editors-guild-voices-concern-over-karnataka-govt-decision-to-set-up-fact-check-unit/articleshow/103110416.cms,27-08-2023,"NEW DELHI: The
Editors Guild
of India on Sunday voiced concerns over the decision of the Karnataka government to set up a fact-checking unit to monitor ""
fake news
"" on
social media
platforms.
The Guild insisted that efforts to check such content have to be by independent bodies that are not under the sole purview of the government lest they become tools to clamp down on voices of dissent.
Any such monitoring framework should follow principles of natural justice, including giving prior notice, right to appeal and judicial oversight, the Guild said in a statement here.
It said such fact-checking units should also be set up with due consultation and involvement of all stakeholders, including journalists and media bodies, so that press freedom is not tampered with.
The Guild has already filed a petition in the
Bombay High Court
, challenging the amendments to the IT Rules 2023 that allow the setting up of a 'fact-checking unit' under which the executive will have the sole authority to determine what is fake and the powers to order content take-down.

Zee TV
, a television channel under the ownership of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
, initially debuted in South Africa back in 1996. This move followed the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between India and South Africa, which had been suspended for nearly four decades due to apartheid sanctions.
The Hindi-only channel quickly gained immense popularity among the 1.2 million Indian-origin citizens residing in South Africa. Subscriptions soared significantly after the introduction of English subtitles, demonstrating the appeal of diverse content.
IsiZulu, a member of the Nguni language family, is spoken by approximately 27.3 million South Africans, solidifying its position as the most prevalent and widely used indigenous language in the country.
The introduction of Zee Zonke represents a significant step towards cultural inclusivity and promises to deliver captivating entertainment while fostering cultural exchange and understanding in South Africa.

MIB allows BARC to share raw audience data with broadcasters,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/mib-allows-barc-to-share-raw-audience-data-with-broadcasters/articleshow/102995182.cms,23-08-2023,"The
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
(MIB) has allowed the
Broadcast Audience Research Council
(BARC) to share raw-level audience measurement data with broadcasters.
BARC
had sought MIB's approval to share the raw-level data with the broadcasters. The audience measurement body already shares this data with media agencies and advertisers.
""BARC may share raw level data up to the preceding week, i.e., RLD data of the viewership for the W-1st week when the TRP is being reported for the Wth week, with the broadcasters in a transparent and equitable manner while ensuring that the integrity and confidentiality of the BARC panels are maintained at all times,"" MIB said in a letter to BARC.
It also acknowledged that BARC has scaled up the panel homes by about 85%, from 30,000 to 55,000.
Experts believe that raw-level data will provide TV networks with more detailed insights into the behaviour of viewers.
'Policy Guidelines for Television Rating Agencies in India' prescribe that the data generated by the rating agency be made available to all interested stakeholders in a transparent and equitable manner.

SAT refuses to grant relief to Eros against Sebi order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sat-refuses-to-grant-relief-to-eros-against-sebi-order/articleshow/102955758.cms,23-08-2023,"The
Securities Appellate Tribunal
(
SAT
) has refused to grant any immediate relief to
Eros International Media
, its executive vice chairman
Sunil Lulla
, and CEO
Pradeep Dwivedi
from the
Securities Exchange Board of India
's (SEBI)
interim order
restraining them from buying, selling, or dealing in securities until further orders.
While disposing of the appeals filed by Eros, Lulla, and Dwivedi on Tuesday, the appellate tribunal directed them to file a reply or objection along with a stay vacation application against SEBI's June 22 order within three weeks.
""We do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order at this stage, and we dispose of the appeal, directing the appellants to file a reply or objection along with a stay vacation application to the ad-interim ex-parte order dated June 22, 2023, within three weeks from today,"" the bench of Presiding Officer Justice Tarun Agarwala and Technical Member Meera Swarup said in an order.
""In its recent rulings concerning both
Eros
and Zee, SAT has unambiguously established that a post-decisional hearing is adequate in instances of ex-parte interim orders, provided that the nature of the case justifies such an order. These rulings also emphasize that the burden rests on the noticees to demonstrate that these orders are excessively severe and disproportionate to the alleged infractions,"" said Sumit Agrawal, Partner, Regstreet Law Advisors.
""This is particularly crucial when the interests of investors are at stake. In previous instances, such as the Arshad Warsi case, SAT has delimited the scope of SEBI's orders. However, this was only achievable when the noticees successfully proved the disproportionate nature of SEBI's original order, leading SAT to issue its own directive,"" adds Agrawal, who is also a former SEBI Officer.
Live Events
The SAT has also directed SEBI to appoint a whole-time member (WTM) within a week from the date of filing the reply along with the stay vacation application by Eros, Lulla, and Dwivedi.
Thereafter, the WTM will also have to pass an appropriate order within three weeks after hearing the appellants and considering the material evidence they provide.
The appellate tribunal also made it clear that any observation made by this tribunal is only prima facie and will not be utilized by either of the parties.
""It is a balanced decision as it provides Eros an opportunity to present their stand before SEBI. Directions have been given to decide the objections to the stay order in a time-bound manner. In my view, it is a favourable order for Eros, as they would get another chance to challenge the SEBI order if it is decided against them even after the submission of the objections, said Ashish K. Singh, managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal.
On June 22, SEBI WTM Ashwani Bhatia passed an ex-parte ad interim order restraining Lulla from holding the position of a director or key managerial personnel (KMP) in any listed company, including Eros, its subsidiaries, or any SEBI-registered intermediary until further orders.
Dwivedi was restrained from holding the position of a director or a KMP in any listed company other than Eros.
Lulla, Dwivedi,
Eros International Media
, Eros Worldwide FZ LLC, and Eros Digital were also restrained from buying, selling, or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever until further orders.
SEBI noted that Eros' books of accounts have been overstated and do not present a true and fair picture of the financial health of the company.
The market watchdog had also stated that the transactions between the content advance entities and the trade receivable entities raise the possibility that Eros was circulating funds whereby amounts transferred as content advances were subsequently recognised as revenue by routing them through trade receivable entities.
""This, coupled with the fact the company is still advancing funds to entities that have been potentially involved in siphoning off funds to entities related to the promoters, makes it imperative for SEBI as the market regulator to take action in the interest of the public shareholders of the company,"" SEBI said in its interim order.

Kiran Mani
as the CEO for the digital business, sources privy to the development have told ET.
Currently, Mani is Google's General Manager and MD for Android and
Google Play

As the head of the digital business, Mani will be responsible for spearheading the growth of

, which has disrupted the video streaming market with its free proposition.
Viacom18 declined to comment on the story.
JioCinema is looking to build scale through free streaming of big media properties like the Indian
Premier
League (
IPL
) and Bigg Boss. It is also doubling down on investments in original OTT content.
Live Events
Besides the ad-supported offering, the platform also has a subscription service that includes Hollywood content from content providers like HBO and NBCUniversal.
Of late, Viacom18 has been on a hiring spree as Uday Shankar, who is giving strategic direction to the company, is building a new leadership team.
Kevin Vaz, who oversaw the entertainment division at Disney Star, has joined the company as CEO of TV and digital (regional entertainment).
Another former Disney Star executive, Alok Jain, has joined Viacom18 as President and Head of Colors Hindi and Regional, with an additional mandate to oversee the regional digital content rollout.
Anil Jayaraj, who was the ad sales head of Star Sports, is currently the CEO of Viacom18's sports business. He joined the company in 2021.

Success of Women's World Cup can't hide financial gap with men,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/success-of-womens-world-cup-cant-hide-financial-gap-with-men/articleshow/102892766.cms,21-08-2023,"Just a few years ago, pre-season training for Stoke City's women sometimes included painting the dugout and removing litter from the pitch at a former working men's club in central England.
Now, in line with a global boom in women's football, they are being paid, receive instructions from a full-time coach, enjoy the same multi-million pound training facilities as the men - and no longer moonlight as rubbish collectors.
""In such a short time, we've seen massive changes,"" said 24-year-old midfielder Molly Holder, in her third campaign at Stoke. ""We go early to use the gym, we have access to the physio, 20 minutes in the video analysis room, maybe some darts and food with team mates. We feel part of Stoke.""
That professionalisation has underpinned the success of the ninth
Women's World Cup
, which ended on Sunday with Spain beating England by a single goal in a final that pitted the two European countries with the strongest domestic leagues against each other.
Attracting record crowds and television audiences, the tournament buoyed hopes that the women's game can start to bridge the yawning
financial gap
that exists with the men.

According to consultancy
Deloitte
, the women's teams of the highest revenue-generating clubs in world football accounted for only 0-1% of total club revenues, in the 2021/22 season.
Spain's captain Olga Carmona - the scorer of Sunday's deciding goal - plays for
Real Madrid
, where the women's team generated revenues of 1.4 million euros in the 2021/22 season, according to Deloitte.
That compared with the Real Madrid men's teams revenues of 713.8 million euros in the same season.
TV BLACKOUT
In broadcast rights, the women's game has struggled to compete. The FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, threatened Europe's ""Big 5"" nations with a TV World Cup blackout unless their broadcasters upped their offers.
According to FIFA, broadcasters from Britain, Spain, France,
Germany
and Italy offered only $1 million to $10 million for the right to show World Cup games. That compared with the $100 million to $200 million paid for the men's tournament.
""We had to arm-wrestle some people to take the TV deals,"" said Jill Ellis, the coach who led the United States to back-to-back World Cup triumphs in 2015 and 2019 and who now leads FIFA's technical committee.
The question now is whether the vast audiences that tuned in to the World Cup can lead to larger broadcast rights and sponsorship deals for national sides and the domestic clubs that are needed to sustain interest outside of major tournaments.
""Women's football domestically is still in start-up phase,"" Lisa Parfitt, director of Women in Football and co-founder of sports marketing agency The Space Between, told Reuters of the game in general. ""So it's a matter of investing.""
England's success in Euro 2022, when 17.4 million people tuned in to watch the Lionesses beat Germany in extra time, has shown what can happen when a team's success becomes part of the national conversation. The viewing figures did not include those watching in big fan parks and pubs.
Players like Jill Scott, Chloe Kelly and Ella Toone have built up huge social media followings and signed multiple brand sponsorships, keeping their names and the game in the spotlight.
GAME CHANGER
Kieran Maguire, at the University of
Liverpool
, said the England national side then surpassed expectations by selling out Wembley stadium twice for matches outside major tournaments.
But he said the domestic Women's Super League (WSL) had a tougher challenge as it, like other sports, has to contend with the monster that is the men's
Premier
League, which dominates the media and broadcast schedules as the world's best players line up for the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool.
Still, attendances at the WSL rose by 170% on the year before to an average of 5,222, with a record of 47,367 fans set by Arsenal. The number of women registering to play soccer in general rose by 16%.
The women's game also has something different to offer.
According to Simon Chadwick at the Skema business School in France, major brands have always advertised around the men's game because they know they will reach millions of viewers and make a return on their investment.
But both Chadwick and Carlota Planas, a Spain-based women's' football agent representing several World Cup players, argued that the women's game now offers the values of tenacity, resilience and togetherness, which can appeal to advertisers.
""(The players) have had to fight a lot, overcome many barriers, break many ceilings, to get to where they are,"" Planas told Reuters. ""That dream, that enthusiasm, that we have fought for and achieved, is what excites people and makes them hooked.""
Back in Stoke that determination is on display, both among the newly semi-professional women's team and on myriad pitches in nearby villages where eager parents cheer on their daughters.
""Hopefully, after this World Cup, more and more people are going to wake up on a Sunday and think 'Our local team are playing, let's go and watch them',"" Holder said.

NCLAT to hear IDBI Bank’s plea against Zee Ent in payment dispute case on Aug 31,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/nclat-to-hear-idbi-banks-plea-against-zee-ent-in-payment-dispute-case-on-aug-31/articleshow/102795886.cms,17-08-2023,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
) on Thursday agreed to hear
IDBI Bank
’s plea against
Zee Entertainment
in
payment dispute case
on August 31, 2023.
The private lender has challenged an
NCLT
order, which had on May 19 rejected its plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against the media major.
The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had on May 19, 2023, set aside the bank's plea, seeking insolvency against media major Zee Entertainment, observing that it was barred under Section 10A of the Insolvency &
Bankruptcy
Code (IBC).
In its order, the NCLT bench had said that
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL), which was the corporate guarantor for the loan availed by
Siti Networks
-- the principal Borrower of IDBI Bank -- has committed a default.
However, the default was committed during the timeline specified under section 10A of the IBC.
Live Events
Section 10A mandates no application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) can be filed against any debtor by any financial and operational creditor for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020, for a period of one year.
This was a special provision inserted by the government in IBC to help the companies after the economic activities had resumed post-lockdown in phases.
The NCLT said Section 10A bars absolutely and forever, the filing of any application under Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Code, for defaults committed on or after March 25, 2020, up to March 25, 2021.
Siti Networks has taken a loan of Rs 150 crore for a
working capital
facility and as per the agreement, it has to maintain a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).
On March 5, 2021, IDBI Bank invoked the guarantee provided by ZEEL and called to pay Rs 61.97 crore with further interest from February 18, 2021. It claimed an amount of Rs 149.60 crore in default.
This was contested by ZEEL contending that its guarantee provides for a limited and restricted liability on the guarantor and cannot be held liable for the entire debt in case of default by the borrower at Siti Bank.

Self-regulation system of TV channels needs strengthening: Supreme Court,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/self-regulation-system-of-tv-channels-needs-strengthening-supreme-court/articleshow/102732581.cms,15-08-2023,"The
Supreme Court
Monday underlined the need to ""strengthen"" the self-regulation mechanism of television channels. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI)
D Y Chandrachud
verbally observed that the ""self-regulatory"" framework of
television channels
needs to be made ""effective"".
The bench said that it would issue guidelines in this regard so that television channels comply with the regulations. Speaking for the bench, the CJI verbally told the counsel for
News Broadcasters Association
(NBA) that unless stringent rules are framed, no TV channel has compulsion to comply with the rules.
The bench also commented that a penalty of '1 lakh that can be imposed on an errant TV channel for violation of guidelines has barely any deterrent effect. The penalty was revised in 2008, the bench was informed.
The CJI orally observed that the NBA needs to give ""bite"" to its regulations to make it more effective. He added that the penalty should be in proportion with the profits earned by the errant channel from the corresponding show. The CJI made it clear that any government interference in this arena would not be appropriate.
The bench lamented that some
TV channels
go into a ""media frenzy"" in a high profile case and proceed on ""presumption of guilt rather than presumption of innocence"" of the individuals allegedly involved in a crime. It added by indulging in such frenzy, the channels end up pre-empting the case's criminal investigation.

The bench clarified that it was not painting all TV channels with the same brush. The CJI said that there are some TV channels which do not exercise restraint. Hence, there is a need to strengthen the self-regulation mechanism.
The court also directed senior counsel
Arvind
Datar, appearing for NBA, to seek suggestions from former SC judges AK Sikri and RV Raveendran on self-regulation of TV channels. The development took place during the resumed hearing of an appeal filed by NBA against a Bombay High Court ruling that contains adverse remarks against NBA for lacking teeth in self-regulation of TV channels.
Issuing notice on the petition, the top court asked the central government to also submit its response.
Appearing on behalf of the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta also commented that the penalty of Rs 1 lakh was hardly any deterrence on a TV channel.
""This court has to consider whether steps taken to frame a self-regulatory mechanism needs to be strengthened with regard to framework and final orders to be passed,"" the bench ordered.

Ormax Media open to explore options to expand biz outside India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ormax-media-open-to-explore-options-to-expand-biz-outside-india/articleshow/102685310.cms,13-08-2023,"Media consulting
firm
Ormax Media
is exploring expansion outside India after having established itself in the domestic market by developing testing, tracking and forecasting-based tools across films, television and streaming segments, said its CEO
Shailesh Kapoor
.
“We are open to exploring options for geographical expansion outside India through collaborations with research companies in markets like
Asia Pacific
, Africa and
Latin America
,” Kapoor said.
Kapoor said the company is interested in markets where media consumption is growing but media analytics have not evolved. “I believe our proprietary tools can be adapted to such markets and fill in a major need gap,” he said.
The Ormax Media CEO said the company had plans to venture outside India before Covid-19, but the pandemic forced it to delay expansion plans. “Our plans were pushed back because of the pandemic, but we hope to take them up again in the coming year or two,” he said.
Almost 70% of the company’s work currently happens in the theatrical and OTT verticals. “In 2015, 60% of our work would have been TV, 25–30% theatrical and 10-15% OTT. Today, theatrical and streaming are each 35%, TV is roughly 25% and the rest is 5%,” said Kapoor.

Having completed 15 years as a homegrown research company, Ormax Media wants to entrench itself deeper in non-Hindi languages, particularly on the box office side.
The research company has products such as
Moviescope
, First Draft,
Streaming Test
and
TrueValue
for testing film, OTT and TV content. “These products are testing content and forecasting what the probability of success will be,"" said Kapoor.
Content testing is a process by which a company tries to gauge if a content property will work with the target audience.
“In a typical year, we test 75–100 pieces of content, with 15-20% of what we test getting produced. We have tested 925 content properties across TV shows, OTT, and films in 15 years,” Kapoor said.
Ormax Media reports, he said, have also become a key consideration for broadcasters and OTT platforms when purchasing movie rights. “In the last three years, our box office accuracy for films we have tested has been 82%,” he said.
Kapoor also sees the company as a third-party service that measures the viewership of OTT shows across platforms.
The audience research firm conducts primary research among audiences in India on a weekly basis to estimate OTT content viewership. The research findings are then projected onto the Indian OTT ecosystem.
“We want to become the third-party viewership estimation service for OTT from an audience understanding point of view,” said Kapoor.
He said the research firm is estimating the size of the OTT market, the content that is working on OTT and the growth in subscribers on ad and subscription-led platforms.

Messi Magic: Apple TV+ witnesses a two-fold surge in subscribers within a month of Messi joining Inter Miami,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/messi-magic-apple-tv-witnesses-a-two-fold-surge-in-subscribers-within-a-month-of-messi-joining-inter-miami/articleshow/102670659.cms,12-08-2023,"Renowned soccer icon
Lionel Messi
's relocation to the United States to play for
Inter Miami
FC has created ripples not just in the soccer world, but also in the realm of entertainment. While soccer might not hold the same popularity as it does in other parts of the world, his presence in
Major League Soccer
(
MLS
) has infused newfound excitement into the league.
Despite soccer's relative novelty in this region,
Messi
's entry has unexpectedly attracted attention towards the Major League Pass offered on
Apple
TV+. The owner of Inter Miami has enthusiastically disclosed that, ever since Messi's arrival, the number of Major League Pass subscribers has seen an impressive twofold surge. He jubilantly shared his thoughts on social media, coining it the ""Messi Effect,"" and underlined that Spanish viewership during Messi's matches has surpassed the 50% mark and continues to soar, indicating a thriving global fan base.
Recent data released by Apple unveiled a remarkable development – the three most-watched matches in the history of
MLS Season Pass
occurred within the week of July 19-26. This notable shift can largely be attributed to the inclusion of soccer superstar Lionel Messi in the league that same week. Prior to Messi's entry, MLS Season Pass had garnered a subscriber count nearing 1 million.
— Jorge__Mas (@Jorge__Mas)
If we are to credit the owner's claims, this figure has nearly doubled, approaching the 2 million mark, ever since Messi's induction into the league. This substantial rise in viewership can be attributed to Messi's undeniable global appeal. As one of the most outstanding players in the history of the sport, his presence has ignited a massive surge in stadium attendance as well.

NCLT
) on Thursday approved the merger scheme between
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
Limited (ZEEL) and Culver Max Entertainment (
Sony
).
The bench in its oral order allowed the application for the merger.
Earlier on July 10, the division bench of judicial member HV Subba Rao and technical member Madhu Sinha reserved its order in the merger scheme between ZEEL and Sony, after hearing all the parties.
Various operational and financial creditors had objected to the Zee-Sony merger scheme in the NCLT. The company has reached a settlement with
IDBI Bank
,
IndusInd Bank
, and the Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS).
“The NCLT's order rightly rejects the misconceived objections to the scheme, which seems to have been filed solely to arm twist the merging entities. The order paves way for the merger, which is beneficial to all the stakeholders, including the shareholders and the creditors. Quite rightly, the order also upholds and safeguards the interests of all genuine stakeholders” said Anuj Tiwari, Partner at ASR & Associates who is advising
Zee
group on merger.

Recently, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) declined to overturn the interim order issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) prohibiting ZEEL Chairman Emeritus Subhash Chandra Goenka and his son
Punit Goenka
from serving as directors or executives of publicly listed firms.
ET Bureau
In December 2021, Sony and ZEEL signed definitive agreements to merge. Sony will indirectly hold a majority of 50.86% of the combined company; the founders of ZEEL will hold 3.99%; and the other ZEEL shareholders will hold a 45.15% stake.
Once ZEEL merges with SPNI, the merged entity will have a cash balance of $1.5 billion at closing, including through an infusion by the current shareholders of SPNI and the promoters (founders) of ZEEL.
The fund infusion will enable the combined company to drive sharper content creation across platforms, strengthen its footprint in the rapidly evolving digital ecosystem, bid for media rights in the fast-growing sports landscape, and pursue other growth opportunities.
On September 22, 2021, Sony signed an exclusive non-Binding Term Sheet With ZEEL. On December 21, 2021, Sony and ZEEL signed definitive agreements to merge. The BSE and NSE approved the merger scheme on July 29, 2022.
On October 5, 2022, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) gave conditional approval to the merger and asked ZEEL to sell three Hindi channels—Big Magic, Zee Action, and Zee Classic—to address possible anti-competition concerns arising out of their proposed mega-merger deal.
On October 14, ZEEL shareholders approved the proposed merger of ZEEL and Bangla Entertainment, an SPNI subsidiary, with and into Culver Max Entertainment.

Former Hotstar executives launch their own new venture Postudio,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/former-hotstar-executives-launch-their-own-new-venture-postudio/articleshow/102594550.cms,10-08-2023,"Harish Prabhu, Former VP of Product and Technology and Founding Member of
Hotstar
, and Dhawal Gusain, Former EVP and Head of Content Ops, Insights, and New Initiatives at Hotstar, have launched a new venture,
Postudio
.
Postudio is disrupting the fast-growing $20 billion video post-production market globally by providing an on-demand, cloud-based end-to-end platform for Post-production.
Today, physical post-production studios are the industry norm. These studios not only require a significant upfront investment in the form of hardware, software licenses, and facilities but also suffer from sub-optimal capacity utilization.
Furthermore, post-production is a very collaborative and iterative process; current workflows based on in-person interactions, calls, or email exchanges are grossly inefficient and also pose content security risks.
Additionally, issues like frequent uploading and downloading of large media assets to and from local machines negatively impact productivity. Lastly, physical studios limit talent supply to areas in the vicinity, which limits flexibility and is also not conducive to remote or hybrid work cultures.

In the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, Disney+ Hotstar's subscriber base saw a reduction of 20.9 million subscribers.
Disney+ Hotstar is available in India and certain other Southeast Asian countries.
""Disney+ Hotstar subscribers declined this quarter as we adjusted our product from one centered around the IPL to one more balanced with other sports and entertainment offerings,"" said Walt Disney Interim CFO Kevin Lansberry.
""I would also note that this business, with its significantly lower ARPU compared to core Disney+, is not a material component of our overall D2C financial results,"" he added.
On being asked about the company's international streaming strategy, Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company is looking at multiple markets around the world with an eye toward prioritizing those that are going to help it turn streaming into a profitable business.
""What that basically means is that there are some markets where we will invest less in local programming but still maintain the service. There are some markets where we may not have a service at all. And there are others that we'll consider, I'll call them, high-potential markets where we'll invest nicely for local programming, marketing, and basically full-service content in those markets,"" he added.
The company's revenue from the international channels business decreased by 20% to $1.2 billion, and operating results decreased to a loss of $87 million from an income of $166 million.
It stated that the decrease in operating results was primarily due to lower
advertising
revenue and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. The decrease in advertising revenue was due to lower rates attributable to Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket programming.

Disney+ Hotstar loses 12.5 million subscribers; CEO sheds light on 'strategic' options for TV business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-hotstar-loses-12-5-million-subscribers-ceo-sheds-light-on-strategic-options-for-tv-business/articleshow/102591418.cms,10-08-2023,"Disney has faced its third consecutive quarter of declining subscribers for its streaming service. The primary factor behind this decline was the loss of 12.5 million paid subscribers from Disney+ Hotstar during the third quarter ending on July 1, 2023. This drop in subscribers is the largest ever recorded since the company began disclosing its paid member count in April 2020.
In response to these losses, CEO Bob Iger of Walt Disney Co. has outlined strategies to enhance profitability for their streaming services. The company plans to implement an October price increase for their ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans.
Additionally, Disney aims to curb password sharing practices, a measure that is expected to be enforced throughout the following year.
The recent quarter revealed a $512 million loss in Disney's streaming division, contributing to a total streaming deficit surpassing $11 billion since the launch of Disney+ in 2019. During the same quarter, Disney+ witnessed a decline of approximately 11.7 million subscribers worldwide, leaving the service with a new total of 146.1 million subscribers.
The decline in subscribers for Disney+ Hotstar was primarily driven by the loss of streaming rights to the significant IPL cricket tournament in India. The paid member base for Disney+ Hotstar plummeted to 40.4 million during the quarter, marking a 24% reduction from the previous quarter's 52.9 million. The service had reached a peak of 61.3 million subscribers in the last quarter of 2022.

Interestingly, the decline in subscribers was concentrated in the lower-priced version of Disney+ available in India. Excluding the Indian market, Disney+ gained 800,000 subscribers, primarily from overseas regions.
Viacom18 secured the streaming rights for the IPL tournament from 2023 to 2027, streaming the entire tournament for free on JioCinema. Subsequently, Viacom18 partnered with
Warner
Bros. Discovery to house HBO, Max Original, and Warner Bros. content on JioCinema, a move that was previously under Disney's purview.
Elara Capita's Analyst Karan Taurani said multiple reasons such as IPL moving away from Hotstar , JioCinema offering wide variety of content free, Disney + Hotstar offering ICC cricket World Cup free and HBO content too moving away, have been responsible for this decline.
""However, we believe the subs loss is now largely bottomed out and may see a stable subscriber base/marginal decline over the near term,"" Taurani said.
While Disney reported a 4% revenue increase for the quarter, the company's net profit shifted from $1.4 billion in the year-earlier quarter to a net loss of $460 million. This loss was attributed to the decrease in customers both domestically and internationally.
To address these challenges, Disney is shifting its focus under Iger's leadership. Rather than pursuing rapid subscriber growth necessitating expensive marketing campaigns, Disney aims to extract more value from its existing Disney+ subscribers. This approach includes raising the monthly fee for ad-free Disney+ access and introducing similar increases for the ad-free Hulu plan, potentially surpassing Netflix's pricing.
The media conglomerate intends to increase the cost of its advertisement-free Disney subscription by $3, equivalent to a roughly 27 percent increment, resulting in a new price of $14. Simultaneously, the ad-free Hulu subscription is projected to undergo a $3 price surge, reaching $18 per month. This adjustment would position the service as pricier than Netflix.
The crackdown on password sharing is slated to commence in 2024, with the possibility of extending beyond that year. Analysts, as cited by AP, have suggested that these measures, including the price hike and measures against password sharing, could play a pivotal role in steering Disney towards a trajectory of sustainable growth.
“Our results this quarter are reflective of what we’ve accomplished through the unprecedented
transformation we’re undertaking at Disney to restructure the company, improve efficiencies, and restore creativity to the center of our business,” Variety quoted Iger.
“In the eight months since my return, these important changes are creating a more cost-effective, coordinated, and streamlined approach to our operations that has put us on track to exceed our initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings as well as improved our direct-to-consumer operating income by roughly $1 billion in just three quarters. While there is still more to do, I’m incredibly confident in Disney’s long-term trajectory because of the work we’ve done, the team we now have in place, and because of Disney’s core foundation of creative excellence and popular brands and franchises.”
Strategic options for TV business
In line with this transformation, Disney is contemplating strategic options for its TV networks portfolio, a recognition of the changing landscape due to cord-cutting trends. The Financial Times said Walt Disney is preparing for a future without traditional television as Iger said on Wednesday that he is considering “strategic options” for the company’s portfolio of TV networks.
Iger underscored that Disney's future growth will be fueled by film studios, theme parks, and streaming services, excluding traditional networks like ABC, where his career began.
“While linear [television] remains highly profitable for Disney today, the trends being fuelled by cord-cutting are unmistakable,” he told investors after the company reported fiscal third-quarter results, FInancial Times reported. “We are thinking expansively and considering a variety of strategic options.”
ESPN, the sports cable network under Disney, is also exploring strategic partnerships while aiming to retain control of the network. Iger acknowledged the shift of premium sports programming to streaming, emphasizing the inevitability of a transition away from linear TV assets. The potential sale of linear TV assets, including ABC, is being considered as Disney adapts to the evolving media landscape.
“He was very clear that the linear TV assets are for sale,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. “He doubled down on the fact that ABC is for sale.”

ESPN strikes $1.5B deal to jump into sports betting with Penn Entertainment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/espn-strikes-1-5b-deal-to-jump-into-sports-betting-with-penn-entertainment/articleshow/102553438.cms,09-08-2023,"You know

the sports media giant. Now brace yourself for
ESPN Bet
, a rebranding of an existing sports-betting app owned by
Penn Entertainment
, which is paying $1.5 billion plus other considerations for exclusive rights to the ESPN name.
The deal, announced Tuesday, could take Walt Disney Co.-owned ESPN into uncharted waters. Disney is fiercely protective of its family-friendly image, not typically associated with the world of sports gambling.
Penn
will operate ESPN Bet, which ESPN has agreed to promote across its online and broadcast platforms in order to generate ""maximum fan awareness"" of the app. ESPN Bet will also have unspecified ""access"" to ESPN talent, the companies said.
Penn's rights to the ESPN brand will initially run for a decade and can be extended for another decade by mutual agreement. In addition to the $1.5 billion licensing deal, which will be paid out over a decade, Penn will also grant ESPN rights worth about $500 million to purchase shares in Penn.
""Penn Entertainment is the perfect partner to build an unmatched user experience for
sports betting
with ESPN Bet,"" ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in a statement.

Disney has wrestled with the issue of adult-oriented entertainment in the past. Until about 15 years ago, its Walt Disney World park in Orlando, Florida, featured a gated late-night area known as Pleasure Island - actually a reference to the 1940 film ""Pinocchio,"" whose characters visited a den of iniquity by that name. Pleasure Island featured bars, music venues and nightclubs in addition to restaurants, shopping and a nightly countdown to ""New Year's Eve"" complete with fireworks.
When attendance waned, Disney closed down the Pleasure Island nightclubs in 2008 and redeveloped the site as a restaurant and shopping district now known as The Landing at Disney Springs.
ESPN added that it will use its platforms ""to educate sports fans on responsible gaming"" - for instance by continuing to cover the sports betting industry with ""journalistic integrity,"" creating a ""responsible gaming"" committee within the company and developing marketing guidelines that ""safeguard"" fans.
Penn also announced that it sold Barstool Sports, an irreverent sports media site, back to its founder Dave Portnoy. Penn took a 36% stake of Barstool Sports in February 2020 for about $163 million and subsequently acquired the remainder of the company for about $388 million in February 2023. Neither Penn nor Portnoy disclosed terms of the divestment deal.
In a video posted on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, Portnoy radiated excitement over the site's regained independence. The regulated gambling industry, he said, ""was probably not the best place for Barstool Sports and the kind of content we make."" Portnoy added that he will ""never"" sell the company. As part of the divestment deal, Penn would be owed 50% of the gross proceeds from any future sale or ""monetization"" of Barstool.

""We expect the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to garner 1.6-1.9x of base price (approximately 32% higher than earlier cycle rights on a like-to-like basis, as the number of matches has come off by 15% vs the earlier cycle), as the current base at Rs 450 million per match is already 25% lower than the last cycle’s price of Rs 600 million,"" Analyst Karan Taurani wrote in the report.
The combined base price of TV and digital stands at Rs 3,960 crore for 88 matches to be played in the next five year cycle of 2023-2028. The TV and digital rights carry base price of Rs 20 crore and Rs 25 crore per match, respectively, Elara noted.
Elara said the BCCI expects at least Rs 60 crore per game at the auction, which translates into a base price of Rs 5,280 crore via the eAuction process.

Indian cricket domestic media rights: Can BCCI breach 1 billion dollar mark with 21 games against Australia and 18 vs England?
The brokerage expects premium to be higher than the base price for digital, as TV rights premium may be in the range of 30-40% over base price whereas digital rights premium could be in the range of 80-90%, which translates into a per match price of Rs 80 crore (TV and digital).
""We believe this pricing is justified as it will give platforms an opportunity to breakeven or turn profitable. India’s ad environment may turn conducive in CY24, led by profitable new age & commerce firms, inflationary pressures cooling off and emergence of Meta, Web 3.0 & 5G,"" Taurani said.
In 2018,
Star Sports
India had outbid
Reliance
and Sony to win the
BCCI media rights
, for both television and digital platforms, for Rs 6138.1 crore. The rights were for the period of 2018 to 2023.
Disney Star
, that has an array of sports channels both in SD and HD format and offers commentary in regional languages, holds the rights to broadcast and stream matches on TV and on its digital platform for all ICC events. It also has the rights for the Asia Cup till this year. The broadcaster has been traditionally been a favourite choice for sports media rights, given its robust footprint, top technology and years of expertise.

In a first, BCCI sets digital base price higher than TV for bilateral matches
The big media companies including Disney Star, Reliance-owned Viacom 18 and perhaps even Sony, which is awaiting a merger with Zee, are likely up on toes to grab the media rights for India's bilateral matches to be played in the country for 2023-2028 period.
While India's games are lucrative assets, this also comes at a time when Disney Star and Reliance Jio have spent a cumulative Rs 48,390 crore for IPL's separate Tv and digital coverage; the first time that BCCI split the rights.
Elara said the sharp growth in IPL media rights price (like-to-like), was due to higher inflation in cricket pricing than other genres (0.8x growth over a five-year period at a CAGR of 12-13%), firms taking part in the bidding process on the digital side, including global OTT giants, and scarcity premium as cricket is an important strategy for any platform to increase scale on digital.
""However, the BCCI is keeping the base price lower at 25% than the price of the past cycle, which indicates likely low demand and wanting to attract interest from platforms. Premium in these media rights could be lower than the earlier cycle, due to 1) fewer platforms bidding, 2) curtailed ad spend of new age & commerce firms, and 3) IPL revenue decline of 20-25% YoY in CY23 (TV and digital),"" it said.

Amazon, Google wooed by India for $750 million cricket rights
Industry experts had earlier expressed views that media companies may have a cautious approach while bidding for BCCI media rights, considering that they have already committed $9 billion towards IPL and ICC rights. Moreoever, the companies are also entangled with other issues including potential mergers, stake rejig or spending hefty amounts to capture larger market share.
Bloomberg last week reported that the BCCI is likely wooing tech hiants Amazon and Google to bid for digital rights. However, industry insiders said the likelihood of the two companies bidding for the India cricket rights is very negligible.
""As far as Amazon is concerned, they didn't even bid for IPL, which is BCCI's biggest property right now,"" a senior executive from one of the broadcasters told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

Tata Play
on Monday said it has started beaming of television
channels
from its dedicated
GSAT-24 satellite
which it has leased from Indian space agency
ISRO
.
GSAT-24
was specifically launched for Tata Play (earlier knows as
TataSky
) in June last year, which will help increase its carrying
capacity
to 900 channels and cover the length and breadth of the country including far-flung places like Andaman Nicobar and Lakshsdweep islands.
After the launch, ISRO took time to place the
satellite
in the desired slot of 36,000 kilometre geosynchronous orbit. The satellite was first tested by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and handed over to Tata Play, which carried out its own tests.
Commenting over the development, MD & CEO Harit Nagpal said this will help Tata Play carry 900 channels, including the regional channels and Gyanwani channels, which would be launched by the government.
""This will help Tata Play to carry 900 channels from the present 600. It will also improve signal reception and channel capacity,"" he said, adding, ""it will become largest satellite bandwidth provider among all DTH platforms.""
This is the third made-in-India satellite which Tata Play is using for its
DTH service
. Now all the new customers would be served from the new one.

Editors Guild voices concern on Press and Registration of Periodicals Bill,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/editors-guild-voices-concern-on-press-and-registration-of-periodicals-bill/articleshow/102478257.cms,06-08-2023,"The
Editors Guild
of India on Sunday voiced deep concerns about certain ""draconian powers"" in the
Press and Registration of Periodicals Bill
that grant government powers to have more intrusive and arbitrary checks into the functioning of newspapers and magazines. In a statement here, the
Guild
demanded that the
Press and Registration of Periodicals
(
PRP
) Bill, which seeks to replace the Press and Registration of Books Act-1867, be referred to
a Parliamentary Select Committee
.
The Guild is concerned about the expansion of powers of the
Press Registrar
, the new restrictions on citizens to bring out periodicals, the continuation of power to enter premises of news publications, the vagueness inherent in many of the provisions, and the ambiguity surrounding power to frame rules that can have adverse implications on press freedom, a statement by the Guild said.
The Guild has already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker
Om Birla
,
Rajya Sabha
Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar, leaders of political parties, as well as Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur highlighting its concerns on the Bill.
""Given the liberal and arbitrary use of UAPA - which is the basis for defining 'terrorist act' and 'unlawful activity'-- as well as other criminal laws, including sedition, against journalists and media organisations to suppress freedom of speech, the Guild is deeply concerned by the introduction of these new provisions and the way they can be misused to deny the right to bring out news publications to persons who are critical of governments,"" it said.
It urged that only the Press Registrar should be the relevant authority for the purpose of this Act and no other government agency should be given any powers with respect to registration of periodicals.

""The law on this issue should be more respectful of freedom of the press and should avoid granting vast powers to regulatory authorities to either interfere or shut down the press at their whims and fancies,"" the Guild said, asserting that the primary emphasis of the Registrar and the PRP remains ""registration"" and not ""regulation"".
The PRP
Bill
was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on August 1 and passed two days later.

Indian cricket domestic media rights: Can BCCI breach 1 billion dollar mark with 21 games against Australia and 18 vs England?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/indian-cricket-domestic-media-rights-can-bcci-breach-1-billion-dollar-mark-with-21-games-against-australia-and-18-vs-england/articleshow/102449420.cms,05-08-2023,"The Indian cricket board is expecting to breach the $1 billion (Rs 8,200 crore approx) mark in its cumulative earnings from selling the separate TV and digital rights for India's 88 home games during the five-year period till March 2028. The highlight of this new cycle will be 21 home games against Australia (five Tests, 6 ODIs and 10 T20Is) along with 18 games against England (10 Tests, 3 ODIs and 5 T20Is) out of the 25 Tests, 27 ODIs and 36 T20Is.
During the last five-year phase (2018-23), the
BCCI
had earned USD 944 million (Rs 6,138 crore approx in 2018 exchange rate) from Star India with a price per international game being Rs 60 crore (digital plus TV).
Unlike last time, the BCCI will invite separate bids for TV and digital rights after a whopping Rs 48,390 crore earning during the IPL media rights auction where Reliance won the digital bid and Star won the TV rights.
The bidding process will once again be conducted through e-auction just like it happened with the IPL media rights as it is considered the most transparent process for best price discovery.
Those who are tracking the developments feel that even digital rights for Indian cricket will skyrocket and the response for TV will be way more tepid in comparison.

""It is difficult to put a number right now as the value of dollar to rupee has also changed from the exchange rate of last time. But don't be surprised if digital rights earns way more than TV,"" a broadcaster involved in this business said.
While there are number of companies who has bought the bid document worth Rs 15 lakh, the three serious bidders for India's (men and women's) home matches are going to be
Disney Star
and Reliance Viacom, while Zee could be a big contender if the merger with Sony is completed before the auction scheduled during the first week of September.
""It is too early to comment but there will be only three serious bidders if Zee-Sony conglomerate joins the bidding war. There are many things one needs to factor in. Two entities -- Reliance and Star -- had gone all out for IPL rights. Star also owns the ICC tournament property. So how much each will stretch is a question,"" a senior executive from one of the broadcasters told PTI on conditions of anonymity.
""As far as Amazon is concerned, they didn't even bid for IPL, which is BCCI's biggest property right now.""
But, considering there is a World Cup happening in three months and in case India doesn't win the championship, the subsequent few months could be bad in terms of advertisement revenue.
""There are 25 home Tests in this cycle. But if you check out last cycle, how many Tests practically went into the fifth day? Most Tests in India end inside three days. The broadcaster will factor that in,"" another broadcaster said.
""Obviously a series against Sri Lanka or Afghanistan won't fetch you the amount that England or Australia will get you. The ad rates per second for a T20 match will be more than most Test matches. So when your company puts in a bid, these things are kept into account.
""Also you need to ensure your current stars play 'x' number of games in that cycle in this day and age of workload. The NDA has a clause,"" he added.

Viacom18
is looking to scale up its tentpole entertainment property
Bigg Boss
to reach 350-400 million audience on both TV and digital for the seventeenth season while aiming to generate Rs 350 crore of revenue.
The media network is pitching Bigg Boss as the second most popular media property after the Indian
Premier
League. ""Bigg Boss is the IPL of entertainment,"" Viacom18 Head of Network Sales Mahesh Shetty told ET.
The network is hopeful of achieving the viewership target since the TV reach last season stood at 174 million and is expected to cross 200 million this year. On digital, the property will be streamed on
JioCinema
, a much stronger platform compared to
Voot
, which is being integrated with the former.
JioCinema had raked in 450 million viewers through free streaming of the IPL 2023.
""We are targeting an audience reach of 350-400 million for Bigg Boss 17 on both TV and digital. The viewership will also grow exponentially on OTT because the show will stream on JioCinema, which is a much bigger platform,"" Shetty stated.

While Shetty is tight-lipped about the ad revenue numbers, the company is believed to have set an internal target of Rs 350 crore since advertisers are expected to up their ad spending during the second half of FY24 due to the festive season.
He expects ad monetisation to be equally strong on both TV and digital.
Bigg Boss 16 garnered Rs 250 crore worth of ad revenue. However, the ad spending during the festive season last year was below expectations due to the challenges faced by FMCG companies, the biggest ad spending category in broadcast entertainment.
Viacom18 has already closed two sponsorship deals and is eyeing 12 sponsors in total. ""Bigg Boss has traction across categories. We are tapping FMCG, personal care, kitchen products, beauty, and auto,"" Shetty said, adding that the property is not over-indexed in one category.
The media company is seeking outlays of Rs 6-45 crore from sponsors. ""We have sponsorship packages for advertisers of different ticket sizes. 65% of the ad inventory is consumed by sponsors, while spot buyers take 35% of the inventory,"" he said.
Bigg Boss' advantage is that it covers the entire festive calendar, from Dussehra to Christmas. ""Brands who partnered with us want to come again, and new brands are also keen to associate. There is a very strong demand for Bigg Boss because it's a tried and tested property,"" he stated.
The fact that the property's viewership witnessed growth last year on both TV and digital will also help it get premium rates from clients.
""Last year, we delivered 174 million viewers on TV. On Social, we had a reach of 15 billion across all platforms, while engagement stood at 200 million. Bigg Boss is not just about TV, it's also about OTT and social media,"" Shetty said.
Bigg Boss 16's average rating was 2 TVR, while the finale rated 3.9
TVR
due to the programming tweaks made by the Viacom18 content team.
""Last year was a reboot year for Bigg Boss. While the core remained the same, the show became more fast-paced, and there was uncertainty to keep the viewer's interest alive every day,"" he stated.
Bigg Boss' rating usually spikes during the weekends while remaining flat during the weekdays. ""But last year, our ratings during the weekend and weekdays were the same due to tweaks we made to the show,"" Shetty said.

The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had on May 19, 2023, set aside the bank's plea, seeking insolvency against media major Zee Entertainment, observing that it was barred under Section 10A of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
In its order, the NCLT bench had said that
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL), which was the corporate guarantor for the loan availed by
Siti Networks
-- the principal Borrower of IDBI Bank -- has committed a default.
However, the default was committed during the timeline specified under section 10A of the IBC.
Live Events
Section 10A mandates no application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) can be filed against any debtor by any financial and operational creditor for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020, for a period of one year.
This was a special provision inserted by the government in IBC to help the companies after the economic activities had resumed post-lockdown in phases.
The NCLT said Section 10A bars absolutely and forever, the filing of any application under Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Code, for defaults committed on or after March 25, 2020, up to March 25, 2021.
Siti Networks has taken a loan of Rs 150 crore for a working capital facility and as per the agreement, it has to maintain a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).
On March 5, 2021, IDBI Bank invoked the guarantee provided by ZEEL and called to pay Rs 61.97 crore with further interest from February 18, 2021. It claimed an amount of Rs 149.60 crore in default.
This was contested by ZEEL contending that its guarantee provides for a limited and restricted liability on the guarantor and cannot be held liable for the entire debt in case of default by the borrower at
Siti Bank

Disney Star curates flexible ad packages for Asia Cup and ICC World Cup while it chases unprecedented reach,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-star-curates-flexible-ad-packages-for-asia-cup-and-icc-world-cup-while-it-chases-unprecedented-reach/articleshow/102321206.cms,02-08-2023,"Disney Star
is bullish about getting robust sponsorships from most sectors, be it startups or established firms, banking on flexible advertising packages for the upcoming marquee
Asia Cup
and ICC ODI World Cup events that it forecasts will see unprecedented reach.
""We are making advertising on Disney Star network flexible, we are making it customisable. Our ambition is to make the Asia Cup and the ICC World Cup the biggest-ever on both TV and digital,"" Ajit Varghese, head of network advertising sales at Disney Star, told ET Online. ""We are making sure that every brand in India today who's thinking of advertising in the next three months, whether it's television plan or digital plan, will find a way to use cricket on Disney Star, the go-to destination during the festive season.""
Emphasizing the company's commitment to meeting brand objectives, Varghese explained that advertisers can choose from various flexible packages tailored to their specific needs, accommodating budgets ranging from Rs 10 lakh to as high as Rs 50 crore to Rs 100 crore. These packages may include Asia Cup + World Cup bundles, TV and digital packages, or any other combination that suits an advertiser's preference.
Contrary to the perception that cricket advertising is expensive, Disney Star aims to make it more accessible, as sources said the company is offering entry points with costs as low as 70 cost per thousand (CPM), equivalent to buying advertisements on an user-generated content platform in the country today.
“With no restrictions on minimum outlays, presence on CWC 2023 is a possibility for every brand, irrespective of size and scale.
Star Sports
team can customize an advertiser’s presence in both the events based on the budgets available,” he added.

The economy & markets
Disney Star is also seeing a revival in advertisements after macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. The company is bullish that improving economic conditions, as also evident in GST collections and inflation stabilisng within the RBI’s comfort band, to add momentum for brands and advertising activity going into the September-to-November period.
""We are still seeing headwinds in the startup space. But we are also seeing some offshoots back in action, which is in the mobility space or in the FinTech space, they are back in action,"" Varghese said.
""We saw a big slowdown in ecommerce earlier, but it is slowly getting back into action now. We are already seeing a lot of positive signs from the auto industry, infrastructure, real estate,"" he added.
While GST Council's decision to levy 28% indirect tax on online gaming has created panic among these companies, which have in recent years emerged as advertisers with big wallets for sports events, Disney Star said they have yet to see a negative impact on marketing spend and it will be too early to comment on it for future trends.
Brands tapping cricket enigma
The spokesperson said there is a category of advertisers who may not have used cricket as a platform to showcase their products. Now, they are keen to explore possibilities of endorsements in the double bonanza of Asia Cup and World Cup.
The network is introducing language feed specific sponsorships for the first time on Asia Cup and World Cup for regional advertisers on the digital platform. They are also offering early bird pricing (powerplay offer) to grab only India+Playoffs presence at no/zero-premiums (vs. full tournament).
In addition to its commitment to deliver value to advertisers, Disney Star is focusing on improving client effectiveness rather than driving down rates or even making pricing a barrier. Varghese clarified that the advertising packages are not designed to compete or lower prices; instead, the company seeks to maximise brand exposure and engagement through strategic placements.
Varghese said their network has seen a robust jump in TV ratings during cricket series over the last year or so and the momentum will accelerate with the double dose of Asia Cup and World Cup that will be happening around and during the festive season in India.
Double Bonanza
Disney Star, which operates Star Sports channels and Disney+ Hotstar, will be broadcasting both the Asia Cup and the 50-overs ICC World Cup mega tournaments.
Asia Cup 2023 is scheduled to be held during September in cricket-crazy India and the Asian nation will also host the ICC Men’s
Cricket World Cup
spanning nearly two months from October 5 to November 19. While the Asia Cup has 13 matches scheduled, the World Cup will see 10 countries fighting for the coveted trophy and there are a total of 48 matches scheduled.
Cricket World Cup in 2019 was one of the most watched tournaments in the history of Indian television with a reach of 552 million viewers. India’s match against Pakistan in the last edition had garnered 244 million viewers on TV, while other matches of the then captain
Virat
Kohli-led team had a viewership of at least 210 million, according to BARC data. In 2019, the World Cup was available to view for free for a select telecom partner and with deeper penetration of India and rapid increase in smartphone users, the digital reach is expected to surpass previous benchmarks.
Experts believe matches involving Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are expected to see a scale equivalent to an India-Pakistan match. Moreover, with growing interest for the game among women, more brands selling products for the female users will also look to feature during the World Cup games this time.
""We will do whatever is required to make sure that the maximum number of people have access to both television and digital,"" Varghese said. ""Now we have the opportunity to become the largest online video platform in India,"" he added.
Media experts believe both the events will see a deluge of viewers amid festive season, while arch rivals Pakistan and India are scheduled to clash in both these tournaments. In fact, the Pakistan cricket team will be visiting India to participate in the once-in-four years World Cup event that is taking place in India after 12 years.
The tournaments also come after the marquee Indian
Premier
League this year set record viewership numbers for both television and digital platforms.
According to industry sources, the network has the potential to reach out to more than 800 million viewers across TV (GEC+ sports) and Disney+ Hotstar (entertainment + sports) over the next three months.
Making the most of the opportunity
The two cricketing events definitely offer Disney Star an opportunity to capitalize given that it is the exclusive broadcasting and streaming partner, unlike for the IPL where BCCI had split the media rights for the first time. Disney Star had picked the TV rights and billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani's JioCinema had the digital rights.
Disney Star has also announced that Asia Cup and World Cup will be streamed without subscription charges on mobile phones and tablets.
For the digital platform, Disney+ Hotstar is providing interactive ad formats tailored to meet each advertiser's specific requirements. These dynamic formats range from live video ads, 3D animation, ads enabling direct whatsapp messaging to user, display and video billboards on CTV. There will be the added option to contextualize ads based on key moments.
ET had earlier reported citing sources that Star Sports is asking for Rs 120 crore for co-presenting sponsorship and Rs 90 crore for associate sponsorship opportunities for the World Cup. The broadcaster is asking spot buyers to pay Rs 31 lakh per 10-seconds for India and knockout matches.
The sports broadcaster aims to secure Rs 26 crore for co-presenting sponsorship and Rs 20 crore for associate sponsorship for the Asia Cup while seeking spot buy rates of Rs 25 lakh per 10 seconds for India vs. Pakistan as well as the final match.

Bollywood actor Suniel Shetty buys minority stake in Panja League,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/bollywood-actor-suniel-shetty-buys-minority-stake-in-panja-league/articleshow/102255396.cms,31-07-2023,"Actor and entrepreneur
Suniel Shetty
has picked up a minority stake in
Pro Panja League
, a professional arm-wrestling tournament launched by celebrity couple Parvin
Dabas
and Preeti Jhangiani through their company Panja Sports.
""I am on board with Pro Panja League as an equity partner at the group level,"" Shetty told ET. “My shareholding will be in the single digits.”
Pro Panja League was founded in 2020. The inaugural season of the tournament, featuring six teams, kicked off on July 28 at the IGI Stadium in New Delhi. The tournament is being telecast on
Sony Sports
channels, while Dream Sports-owned FanCode is live-streaming it.
Shetty, who has invested in multiple startups, said arm wrestling has massive potential in India since it’s an indigenous grassroots sport with a very low entry barrier and is TV-friendly.
""Arm wrestling is truly an Indian sport in which both men and women can participate,"" Shetty said. “The infrastructure required for the sport is very minimal. It is also a TV-friendly sport. It will generate a lot of excitement because the results are guaranteed.”
Live Events
Dabas said Shetty's association with Pro Panja League will be a draw for the public. ""We are marrying sports and entertainment with the Pro Panja League,"" he said.
According to Dabas, Panja Sports will invest Rs 20 crore in the league in the first two years.
The first year will be more about capturing viewers' attention than generating revenue, he said. ""We want to establish the league in the first year. Big-ticket sponsors will come in once the league has enough eyeballs,"" Dabas said.
He also said that Pro Panja League franchise owners will break even in the third or fourth year, since the cash burn is very low. Each franchise owner will have to invest Rs 2.25-2.5 crore every year.
Dabas said the league had already built a strong online community. ""We had 270 million views on our social media channels in the last 10 months,"" he said.
Panja Sports aims to organise standalone tournaments throughout the year to build the sport at the grassroots level.

"Spiderman, Ghostbusters now caught in the web of Hollywood strike as Sony to postpone releases",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/spiderman-ghostbusters-now-caught-in-the-web-of-hollywood-strike-as-sony-to-postpone-releases/articleshow/102223862.cms,29-07-2023,"In the realm of entertainment, Hollywood studios seem to be the 'poor things' now when it comes to releasing their popular movies this year as they scramble to contend with a strike by unionized actors.
According to reports earlier, one of the major studios, Disney, is reevaluating its film release schedule for the remainder of the year. The strike has created uncertainty about the actors' ability to promote the movies, prompting
Disney
to consider potential delays for titles like ""Poor Things,"" ""Next Goal Wins,"" ""Wish,"" and ""Magazine Dreams,"" all originally slated for release this year.
Now,
Sony Pictures
Entertainment has recently decided to postpone the release of two major films: ""Kraven the Hunter"" and a sequel to ""
Ghostbusters
: Afterlife."" This move joins other studios' actions in removing big-budget movies from the 2023 release calendar, causing concern for theaters and disappointing fans.
Sony has also pushed back some of its significant releases planned for 2024, such as ""Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse"" and a new ""Karate Kid"" installment. In an attempt to navigate around the limitations posed by the strike, they have implemented a unique strategy for the film ""Gran Turismo,"" which involves sneak previews before its wide release.
Meanwhile,
Warner
Bros. is contemplating whether to delay the release of ""Dune: Part Two,"" ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,"" and ""The Color Purple,"" all scheduled for the holiday season in 2023.

Looking ahead, the 2024 release calendar appears to be bustling, with Sony announcing a range of exciting films, including ""Madame Web,"" another ""Ghostbusters"" sequel, a ""Bad Boys"" sequel, a ""Venom"" sequel, ""Kraven the Hunter,"" and ""Karate Kid.""
The actors' strike has presented considerable challenges for studios in promoting their upcoming projects. Members of the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild are prohibited from participating in publicity events, premieres, film festivals, and media interviews supporting films from the struck companies. This has raised concerns about a lack of star power available for movie promotion.
SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, is committed to the strike, seeking improved compensation from streaming services and protections related to artificial intelligence and other issues. Despite the studios' eagerness to resolve the situation, no talks have been scheduled.
The strike's impact on the release schedule is becoming evident, with some studios postponing films. For instance, Searchlight Pictures delayed ""Poor Things,"" and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer moved ""Challengers"" due to the actors' ban on publicity activities.
The dwindling fall release schedule poses a challenge for the movie theater industry, which has been slowly recovering from the pandemic's impact. The timely release of major movies is crucial for the success of multiplex chains like AMC and Cinemark. A robust movie lineup attracts audiences, and the lack of movies during the pandemic resulted in theater closures and screen reductions.
Cineworld, which owns the Regal chain, has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy for almost a year, highlighting the industry's fragility. The strike's potential continuation into September could further affect the 2024 release calendar, as several movies scheduled for next year have halted production during the strike. To meet their 2024 release dates, these films need to resume filming soon.

Appoint a new officer to decide on Zee promoters' case: SAT to Sebi,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/appoint-a-new-officer-to-decide-on-zee-promoters-case-sat-to-sebi/articleshow/102181416.cms,28-07-2023,"Mumbai: The
Securities Appellate Tribunal
has directed market watchdog
Sebi
to appoint a new whole-time member or a higher-grade officer to review the objections of Zee promoters
Punit Goenka
and
Subhash Chandra Goenka
against an interim order against them.
The new whole-time member (WTM) will have to fix a date for a hearing within a week from the date of filing of the reply by the Goenkas and pass appropriate orders within two weeks after the hearing, SAT said in its order on Thursday.
The order came on an application filed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on July 24 requesting the appellate tribunal to modify its July 10 order that barred two of its three WTMs - Ashwani Bhatia and Ananth Narayan G - from hearing the Goenkas' objections in order to eliminate any prejudice.
Bhatia had passed the order against the promoters of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL) on June 12, barring them from holding directorship or managerial position in any listed firm or its subsidiaries for alleged siphoning and round-tripping of funds, until further orders. Narayan was part of the settlement proceedings against them.
The other WTM, Ananta Barua is retiring on July 31.
Live Events
Sebi had sought SAT's permission to appoint Narayan or any authorised officer to consider the objections of the Goenkas and pass further orders in the case.
The tribunal has ruled out Narayan. If no WTM is available, then Sebi may appoint any authorised officer higher in grade, rank, or position than the WTM to decide the matter against the Goenkas, it said.
Sumit Agrawal, founder of Regstreet Law Advisors, said the market watchdog has several options to handle the situation, such as appointing an independent committees like in the NSDL case, or escalating matters to the Supreme Court if needed.
""An example of such delegation occurred during the NSDL Roopalben Panchal IPO case, where a committee comprising Mohan Gopal and V Leeladhar was appointed to investigate allegations against NSDL due to potential conflicts arising from the Sebi chairman's past role as the NSDL chairman,"" he said.
Agrawal, who is a former Sebi officer, said the Sebi chairperson's order-passing authority has changed over the last decade and a half. It has become customary to delegate this power to WTMs or other members of the board in certain cases.

SAT modifies order in ZEEL matter; permits Sebi to appoint authorised officer to decide case,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sat-modifies-order-in-zeel-matter-permits-sebi-to-appoint-authorised-officer-to-decide-case/articleshow/102178875.cms,27-07-2023,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Thursday modified its earlier order and allowed
Sebi
to appoint an authorised officer to decide the alleged fund diversion case involving
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
's promoters
Punit Goenka
and
Subhash Chandra
. This was permitted due to a lack of whole-time members (WTM) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
""We direct Sebi to appoint another WTM, and if no WTM is available, then any authorised officer higher in grade or rank or position to the WTM would hear and decide the matter...The person who is appointed shall pass the order within the stipulated period,"" SAT said in its order.
The order came after the capital markets regulator appealed to SAT to modify the appellate tribunal order passed on July 10 that directed it to appoint another WTM other than the WTM who had passed the order on June 12 in the
ZEEL
(Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd) case. This was done to remove bias.
Sebi, in its appeal, stated that there is no WTM at present to hear and decide the matter.
At present, there are three WTMs -- Ananta Barua, Ananth Narayan G and Ashwani Bhatia. Bhatia is the WTM who passed the impugned order. Ananta Barua is going to retire on July 31, 2023, and therefore, is not in a position to hear and pass an appropriate order before his retirement, Sebi said.
Live Events
""Ananth Narayan G could have been appointed to hear the matter, but we find that Ananth Narayan G was also part of the settlement proceedings and, therefore, in terms of paragraph nos 36 of our order dated July 10, 2023, there is a possibility that this WTM would be influenced by the discussion that took placed in the settlement proceedings,"" it added.
In the interim order on June 12, Sebi barred Chandra and Goenka from holding the position of a director or key managerial personnel in any listed company for siphoning off funds of the media firm. Both Chandra and Goenka moved SAT seeking a stay on the Sebi order, citing injustice.

Earlier, SAT had declined to grant a stay on the interim order issued by the
Securities and Exchange
Board of India (Sebi) against Subhash Chandra Goenka, chairman emeritus of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEE), and his son Punit Goenka, who serves as the company's MD and CEO.
In disposing of the appeals, the appellate tribunal had instructed the Goenkas to submit a response, along with an application to vacate the ex parte ad interim order dated June 12, 2023, within a two-week timeframe.
The SAT had also asked the Goenkas to file a reply to the Sebi seeking modification of the June 12 order to remove Pen India's name as a related entity.
The appellate tribunal had directed Sebi to appoint another WTM to consider the objections of the Goenkas. It was observed that the Sebi's order against the father-son duo was influenced by the Shirpur Gold Refinery order dated April 25, 2023, in which the two are not parties. Sebi WTM Ashwani Bhatia had passed the order in both cases.
On June 12, the Sebi passed an interim order restraining the Goenkas from holding the position of a director or a key managerial personnel in any listed company or its subsidiaries until further orders for alleged siphoning and round-tripping of the funds.

Disney considers delaying some 2023 movie releases over strikes,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-considers-delaying-some-2023-movie-releases-over-strikes/articleshow/102094829.cms,25-07-2023,"Walt Disney Co.
is reviewing its schedule of film releases through the rest of the year and may delay some titles because striking actors won’t help promote the pictures, according to people familiar with the matter.
The discussions are at an early stage, but could impact films including Poor Things, Next Goal Wins, Wish and

, which are all slated for release this year. Any changes will depend on the outcome of the review, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.
Some films may be too far along in their marketing to change. Haunted Mansion is scheduled to hit theaters July 28. Last week,
Disney
released a trailer for The
Marvels
, a superhero film that’s likely to be the biggest picture still on the calendar, saying it’s scheduled for Nov. 10.
A spokesperson for Disney declined to comment.
Hollywood
studios face obstacles in promoting upcoming titles. Work stoppages by the
Writers Guild of America
and the Screen Actors Guild bar talent from participating in red carpet premieres, film festivals and press interviews promoting projects from the companies they are striking against. Last week, Variety reported that
Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.
was considering postponing some of its 2023 films, including Dune: Part Two.

Barbenheimer a huge hit with collections over ₹22 cr on day 1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/barbenheimer-a-huge-hit-with-collections-over-22-cr-on-day-1/articleshow/102044080.cms,22-07-2023,"Christopher Nolan's epic biographical thriller
Oppenheimer
and
Greta Gerwig
's fantasy comedy film
Barbie
grossed over ₹22 crore in domestic box office collections on their opening days of release in India.
Oppenheimer, which cost $100 million to make, outperformed Barbie, which cost $150 million, in domestic collections on the first day. Oppenheimer's opening day take was ₹17.5 crore, while Barbie collected ₹5.3 crore, according to figures given by
Warner
Bros Discovery, the distributor of both the films in India.
Both the films were released on July 21 (Friday) amid high expectations from the film fraternity that they would attract audiences back to theatres. The gross domestic box office collection for the first half of 2023 dropped 15% year-on-year to ₹4,868 crore, as per Ormax Media.
Globally, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal's
Universal Pictures
is the distributor for Oppenheimer, while Warner Bros is the distributor for Barbie. In India, Warner Bros is distributing both films since Universal Pictures shut its India operations in 2020.
""We have had a stupendous response to the first weekend bookings of both Oppenheimer and Barbie, both of which have their own unique set of audiences,"" said Gautam Dutta, co-CEO,
PVR Inox
.
Live Events
He also said all IMAX shows for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer on the PVR Inox circuit are sold out. ""We have scheduled shows as early as 3.45 am to accommodate as many shows on IMAX so that Nolan fans do not miss out on the action for the movie shot on IMAX format,"" Dutta said.
The PVR Inox co-CEO added that the multiplex chain's premium screen formats like P[XL] and BIGPIX had above-average occupancies of more than 55%. ""Considering Oppenheimer is also dubbed in Hindi, we are seeing a wider viewership of the movie beyond the metros.""
He said Barbie, which falls in a different genre, has drawn family audiences cut across generations with average occupancies beyond 45%. He added that the movie has been well received in the ICE Immersive format, which features LED panels on each side of the auditorium.
""Both movies are generating huge word-of-mouth customer reviews, and what is extremely encouraging is that they are not choosing to watch either of the two movies but preferring to watch both, which is translating to occupancies beyond 60%,"" he said.

Hoping to cash in on the global ""

It also cut snack prices - which movie goers have often complained about for costing more than the ticket - and is offering unlimited popcorn refills on weekends.
For the opening weekend, some theatres will also run an ""Oppenheimer"" movie marathon, with back-to-back shows over a 24 hour period. Combined advance sales for both movies for Friday to Sunday was 900,000 tickets, the highest for any film outside the Marvel or ""Avatar"" series, said company co-CEO Gautam Dutta.
""There is a tremendous amount of hype ... The combined revenue from 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie' is likely to make a notable proportion for the current quarter,"" Dutta added.

A PVR Inox staff member in Mumbai said several ""Oppenheimer"" shows - including the midnight and 7 a.m. screenings on Friday - were fully booked.
India's online movie ticket booking service BookMyShow said this week 8% those who bought ""Oppenheimer"" tickets also booked to watch ""Barbie"", many on the same day. More than 354,000 tickets for the two films had been sold by July 15, it added.

BBC Player and BBC Kids are available as a package for Rs 599/year, with BBC Kids priced separately at Rs 199/year. Both BBC Player and BBC Kids will be available as add-on subscription services on
Prime Video
Channels.
BBC Studios South Asia VP of Distribution Stanley Fernandes told ET that India is the fifth country where the company is launching BBC Player. Currently, it is available in Singapore, Malaysia, Germany, and Poland.
Fernandes said BBC Player will have a multi-genre content line-up across scripted, non-scripted, travel, and comedy. BBC Kids will provide programming for children aged up to 12 years.
While BBC Player and BBC Kids have been launched as B2B2C services in partnership with Amazon, the company is open to going direct-to-consumer in the Indian market.

""We want to grow our audiences with Prime Video Channels and then branch out. At some point, we would want to go direct-to-consumer. That is part of our global strategy,"" said Fernandes.
He also stated that Prime Video Channels provide the required technology, viewership, and scalability to BBC Player and BBC Kids.
With the launch of BBC Player and BBC Kids on its platform, Prime Video Channels has expanded its content offering to 20 services.
Vivek Srivastava, the India Head of Prime Video Channels, said multiple global streaming services have chosen to launch and expand their reach in India with Prime Video Channels.
""Prime Video Channels has seen exponential growth in India, with people subscribing to Channels of their choice from the length and breadth of the country,"" he added.
Fernandes said BBC Studios has a library of 25,000 hours of content and it also releases 2,500 hours of fresh content annually.
""The launch in India will include the immediate availability of BBC Kids as well as 2,000 hours of the best scripted and unscripted content from BBC Studios,"" he added.
Fernandes explained that launching the two services in collaboration with Prime Video Channels made sense because BBC Studios and Prime Video had been long-term collaborators in the country.
""We have built a good audience base on Prime Video, and the audience that sits on the platform has been accepting of our content,"" he stated.

Just like the first requisition notice, the second one has also been rejected due to numerical and procedural invalidity. The company said the decision was taken after advice from independent and eminent experts.
""The board of
Dish TV
reviewed the notice requesting an EGM from a group of minority shareholders. After careful consideration, they considered the notice invalid due to its incompleteness, leading to its rejection,"" said Dish TV India CFO

The rejection of the requisition notice drew criticism from the

Rashmi Aggarwal

""The rejection by the company of the requisition notice is arbitrary, illegal, and against the rules and provisions of the

""The original of the said 52 IRNs formed part of the requisition notice of May 15, 2023, which requisition was not accepted by the Board in totality, for reasons set out in our earlier intimation of June 01, 2023,"" it added.
""Consequently and based on aforesaid opinion, the Board has concluded that the abovementioned 52 IRNs cannot be considered valid for the purposes of the requisition received on June 29, 2023, since the requisition of May 15, 2023, was invalidated in totality,"" the company contended.
In view of the invalidity, Dish TV said that the collective shareholding of the valid IRNs forming part of the requisition received on June 29, 2023, does not fulfill the requirement of holding at least 10% of the share capital of the Company for calling an EGM, as prescribed under Section 100 of the Companies Act, 2013.
""Therefore, the Board has decided that the EGM cannot be called due to numerical and procedural invalidity,"" it stated.
The company said that the details of the company's response are being communicated to the advocates representing the members.
""The Company shall also be advising the said advocates that in case the members intend to send a fresh requisition notice, they may do so in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013,"" it noted.

India's entertainment & media industry revenues to reach $73.6 bn by 2027: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/indias-entertainment-media-industry-revenues-to-reach-73-6-bn-by-2027-report/articleshow/101863251.cms,18-07-2023,"The country's entertainment and media industry is expected to see a growth of 9.7 per cent annually in revenues to reach $73.6 billion by 2027, according to a
PwC report
. Evolving consumer preferences, increased internet access and emerging technologies are fast reshaping the Entertainment and Media (E&M) industry, PwC said on Tuesday in a report titled 'Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2023-2027', the 24th annual analysis and forecast of E&M spending by consumers and advertisers across 53 territories in 13 sectors.
For the industry, it said 2022 marked an important inflection point. The total global E&M revenue of $2.32 trillion witnessed a sharp decline from a 10.6 per cent growth rate in 2021 to 5.4 per cent in 2022. This sluggish E&M growth comes on the back of a decline in consumer spending.
For some key sectors, the surge in uptake and revenues experienced during Covid-19 ran out of steam, for example, podcasts, which were among the industry's major success stories in the pandemic, fell by an estimated 80 per cent in 2022.
The global slowdown was further pronounced in advertising, as the internet advertising segment -- by far the single largest contributor to overall advertising revenues -- saw sluggish growth in 2022, the report said.
In India, though, the picture is more promising. E&M revenue in the country witnessed a 15.9 per cent growth to USD 46,207 million in 2022 as compared to 2021.

""In fact, the Indian market is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.7 per cent in the forecast period to reach USD 73,560 million in 2027,"" PwC said.
Powered by over-the-top (
OTT
) platforms, the gaming sector, traditional TV, internet and out-of-home (
OOH
) advertising and the use of the metaverse, India's E&M industry is expected to grow exponentially.
With multidisciplinary cultural spaces being set up in different metros, a rise in in-person events will also provide considerable room for growth as advertisers are keen to access India's diverse demography and large live audiences.
The report said the launch of commercial 5G services in India in 2022 is an important factor shaping the E&M industry capex in 2023.
With new launches from international players and increasing 'pay-lite' options, OTT revenue surged in India to reach USD 1.8 billion in 2022 -- over six times the revenue in 2018 and a 25.1 per cent increase from USD 1.4 billion in 2021, it said.
In India, the report added, the market will continue to grow at an impressive rate of 14.3 per cent, yielding a revenue of USD 3.5 billion in 2027.
Manpreet Singh Ahuja, Chief Digital Officer and Leader of Technology, Media & Telecom at PwC India, said: ""As the adoption of emerging technologies such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning) and the metaverse increase, the range of use cases will broaden, leading to a significant disruption in the media industry. We anticipate that Media & Entertainment enterprises will invest heavily in the transformative ideas of the future to maintain relevance with their audiences.""
Rajib Basu, Partner & Leader - Entertainment & Media at PwC India, said that the Indian Media and Entertainment outlook for the next few years will show an exciting pace of growth. We have a good view of how the industry has reset itself after the pandemic.
""Increased mobile penetration and the use of digital technologies are poised to disrupt existing channels and create new possibilities in the years ahead for the sector.
""It is increasingly becoming important for traditional media and entertainment businesses to adopt the right strategies for growth as they face competition from digitally powered businesses,"" Basu said.
According to the report, India bucked the global trends again this year and has emerged as the fastest-growing newspaper market, with both print and digital segments registering a CAGR of 3.212 per cent.
Stressing that deals will continue to be a means of gaining scale, it noted that in February 2023, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) conditionally approved the USD 10 billion merger between two large media conglomerates, paving the way for the creation of one of India's largest conglomerates spanning television channels, digital platforms and content production.
The report further said that there is a huge long-term potential for the OTT and connected TV (CTV) market in India, courtesy the size and diversity of the country's population. OTT video will continue to get its boost from regional play.
""While the global growth rate for the OTT segment is 8.4 per cent, India is way ahead with a CAGR of 14.32 per cent,"" it said.
On gaming and e-sports, it said India is poised to be one of the fastest-growing markets (currently it is Saudi Arabia) in the world for e-sports with market revenue forecast to grow from USD 7.6 million in 2021 to USD 21 million in 2027.
The report also said among its other uses, generative AI will enable brands to reach across the country's many languages and regions with generic templates that can be adapted and customised to different geographies with local messaging.

The interim committee will function under the supervision of ZEEL's Board and will seek its guidance on all matters about the company, he said.
Touching on the matter of the proposed merger with Sony, he told the employees that it has reached at a very important juncture although the Mumbai Bench of the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT) reserved its order pertaining to the approval.
In his letter, Goenka reminded the employees that the merger has already been cleared by the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), and National Stock Exchange (NSE), besides the shareholders of the company, a person aware of the development said.
He asserted that the problems Goenka is facing at a promoter family level are for him to deal with and should never be the problem of the company and informed the employees that he is taking the next steps in accordance with the law while asking them to focus on their work and not on negativity.
Goenka also reiterated that the merger with Sony is in the interest of all stakeholders of the company and its completion has been his top priority.
ZEEL board has formed an ""interim committee"" to run day-to-day operations on July 14.
""The Board of ZEEL in a meeting conducted on July 14, 2023, evaluated and discussed all the necessary steps, in light of the interim order passed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the subsequent judgement by Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT),"" a ZEEL spokesperson said.
""Since the order restricts Punit Goenka from holding the position as director or key managerial position in a listed company, the Board of the Company has constituted an Interim Committee of senior executives to ensure smooth operations of the Company.""
The interim committee will be under the supervision of the Board and will seek its guidance on all matters pertaining to the company.
The Board continues to have immense faith in the value-building leadership skills showcased by Punit Goenka and will monitor the progress of the matter. The Board also remains confident that the company will deliver robust growth consistently and generate higher value for all shareholders, the spokesperson said.
Market regulator Sebi took action against Chandra and Goenka on June 12 for allegedly siphoning off funds of ZEEL. Following this, they challenged the Sebi order at SAT.
In its interim order, Sebi noted that Chandra and Goenka alienated the assets of ZEEL and other listed companies of
Essel Group
for the benefit of associate entities, which are owned and controlled by them.
In 2021, ZEEL announced that it will merge with Culver Max Entertainment (earlier known as Sony Pictures Networks India).

Last week, the Security Appellate Tribunal refused to vacate the regulator's decision, saying it did not find any illegality or irrationality in

It directed SEBI to pass a final order by the middle of next month and asked Chandra and Goenka to defend themselves before the regulator.
The ruling comes as ZEE and an India unit of Japan's Sony Group are closing in on a merger announced in 2021 to form a $10-billion TV enterprise, with Goenka set to become the merged entity's managing director and CEO.

As per the company's financial data sourced by Tofler, Endemol India doubled its net profit to Rs 82 crore in FY22 while revenue from operations jumped 72% to Rs 426 crore.
Endemol Shine India is among the few content studios in the country that has built scale due to ownership of IP rights. Most content companies have not been able to build scalable businesses since they don't have the IP, which is owned by broadcasters and streaming companies.
Another source said Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India will continue to operate separately even though there will be back-end integration between the two firms.
In recent years, Banijay Asia has achieved great success with hit scripted adaptations like The Night Manager, Call My Agent Bollywood, Hostages, and Fall, as well as successful original productions like Dahan, Matsya Kaand, Undekhi, and Tribhanga.
The content studio has exciting upcoming shows in the pipeline, including Indian adaptations of The Good Wife, Monk, House, and Suits. Additionally, Banijay is at the forefront of non-scripted programming with blockbuster titles such as The Kapil Sharma Show, MTV Roadies, The Voice, The Big Picture, Into The Wild with Bear Grylls, and Case Toh Banta Hai.
Meanwhile, since 2005, Endemol Shine India has established itself as a leading producer in multiple regions with popular shows like Bigg Boss. They have also successfully adapted international formats like Fear Factor, MasterChef, and Deal or No Deal for the Indian audience.
With a strong market presence, Banijay achieved €3.2 billion in revenues and €472 million in EBITDA in 2022. The company has an extensive network of 130 production companies operating in 21 territories, offering a diverse and innovative multi-genre catalogue of programming.
According to a Ficci-EY 2023 report on the Indian media and entertainment sector, total content released across media platforms aggregated 165k hours in 2022, an increase of 3% over 2021.
At 96%, television continued to contribute the most to the creation of content. While OTT content gained 18% over 2021, film content more than doubled in 2022.
Following its exit from Endemol Shine India, CA Media remains invested in the video streaming service YuppTV, artist management and content production company OML, digital celebrity network Fluence, and character entertainment company Graphic India.

"A star returns, but mounting problems keep the shine off Disney",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/a-star-returns-but-mounting-problems-keep-the-shine-off-disney/articleshow/101806115.cms,17-07-2023,"Disney
is in crisis - its share price is less than half the March 2021 peak even as US indices hit record highs - and some fingers are pointing at what one analyst refers to as the ""
India
mess"".
In his second inning, Bob Iger, 72 - who was brought back as Disney CEO eight months ago and has agreed to stay till 2026-end - has struggled to turn around the entertainment giant as its streaming business rakes up losses while legacy TV networks struggle against new-age entertainment.
On July 13, Iger in an interview told a business channel at The Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley that the
Walt Disney Company
is reconsidering its approach to traditional TV business and may consider selling a part of it, including ABC and FX networks.
A day before Iger's interview, the WSJ had written about Disney exploring strategic options for its India business.

A few analysts tracking the firm believe that selling the India business would be good for the media giant's top line, bottom line, and organisational focus.
Analyst Michael Nathanson of Moffett Nathanson wrote in a note, ""We believe fixing Disney's India mess would be a great start to improving long-term cash flow and profitability."" Some even speculated that funds from such a deal might be used to finance the acquisition of the remaining stake in streaming service Hulu from Comcast.
A high-profile Disney delegation visited India during the recently concluded IPL to take stock of operations, triggering speculation about imminent India exit.
ET Online
Is the India business really weighing down Disney's global performance?
In fiscal 2022,
Star
India generated $2.13 billion (or Rs 17,481 crore) revenue, accounting for merely 2.6% of Walt Disney's total $82.7 billion top line. The company's net profit of $173 million (Rs 1,421 crore) represented a mere 5.5% of the media and entertainment conglomerate's net profit of $3.1 billion.
Star India's financials are for April to March period while Disney globally follows October to September calendar.
ET Online
Clearly, if just the financial performance is considered, it is too small to matter. In the second quarter ended March, Disney's dominant linear networks business reported a decline in revenue to $6.6 billion from $7.1 billion a year earlier - which yielded a lower operating income of $1.8 billion, down sharply from $2.8 billion a year earlier. Streaming services, or direct-to-consumer business - Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu - continues to bleed, reporting $659 million in losses on a $5.51-billion revenue.
ET Online
Content sales and licencing incurred losses of $50 million, mainly due to underperforming TV SVOD distribution, partially offset by the success of 'Avatar: The Way of Water' in theatres. However, parks and experiences segment performed well, reporting revenues of $6.76 billion and an operating income of $1.68 billion.
""Linear business is facing the heat in the US and cord cutting has become the norm,"" said Vivek Menon, managing partner of NV Capital, a media and entertainment debt fund. ""Somewhere, Disney also feels that there is no point in investing in the traditional business. Their focus is on streaming and that's where they will devote their investments.""
Disney recently announced a significant restructuring initiative aimed at reducing expenses by $5.5 billion. Of this amount, $3 billion will be achieved through cuts in non-sports content while the remaining portion will come from other non-content costs. It plans to lay off about 7,000 employees.
Clearly, Disney's problems seem more at home.
That said, on a stand-alone basis, the India business is not without issues and is in a bit of a spot.
Cricket woes but profitable TV
Disney's India business includes Disney+Hotstar streaming service and Star India TV network, which it acquired from 21st Century Fox in 2019. It also has a 30% ownership in Tata Play (Tata Sky earlier).
Back in the day, Disney was gung-ho about the scale that the India business could achieve, riding a heady mix of entertainment and sports franchises built by Star India. Incidentally, Iger, too, was bullish about Star India at the time of the acquisition of Fox assets in 2017. In 2020, the company publicly stated that it expected Disney+Hotstar to contribute 70-100 million to Disney+'s global subscriber base by 2024.
Ironically, according to analysts, cricket, which was instrumental in the company's growth in India, is now the Achilles' heel, taking up substantial investments.
ET Online
Under the leadership of former chairman Uday Shankar, Star India spent over Rs 40,000 crore between 2012 and 2017 on acquiring cricket rights. This included two cycles of BCCI media rights for Rs 3,851 crore (2012-2018) and Rs 6,138 crore (2018-2023), ICC media rights for Rs 12,000 crore (2014-2023), and IPL media rights for Rs 16,147 crore (2018-2022). Additionally, Star India acquired the rights to the Asia Cup, Cricket Australia, and the England Cricket Board (ECB) during this period.
After K Madhavan took charge of the Disney's Star India business following Shankar's exit in April 2021, the company has committed upwards of $6 billion (close to Rs 50,000 crore) for properties like IPL, ICC and Cricket Australia.
The returns on these cricket investments are a matter of concern after Viacom 18 outbid Star for digital broadcasting rights for IPL, which had a telling impact.
Between October 2022 and April 2023, Disney+Hotstar's subscribers dropped by 8.4 million following the loss of IPL rights. As of April 1, Disney+ had a paid subscriber base of 157.8 million, of which Disney+Hotstar comprised 52.9 million. In IPL 2023, Disney Star saw its revenue decline by almost half year on year to roughly Rs 1,800-2,000 crore. Given that Disney paid Rs 23,575 crore for IPL TV rights from 2023-27, every year they have to generate upwards of Rs 4,500 crore between advertising and subscription revenue to avoid a loss on this account.
Disney Star has sub-licensed the ICC TV rights to
Zee Entertainment
's for $1.5 billion (Rs 12,000 crore). However, the sub-licescing deal hinges on Zee's proposed merger with Sony Pictures Networks India. If the merger deal fails to go through, the entire $3-billion liability of the ICC media rights will have to be borne by Star.
On the other hand, Star India's entertainment business is immensely profitable, generating substantial cash flow annually. The network operates a diverse range of almost 60 channels. Star India holds a commanding 34% market share across entertainment and sports. On an individual basis, the company boasts an impressive 31% viewership share in the entertainment segment.
ET Online
Outlook
Iger will need both time and funds to turn around the Disney business, and a potential India business sale could help generate funds. But, experts ET spoke with said selling India business won't make strategic sense for Disney.
""It makes sense for Disney to stick it out in India and turn around the company,"" said Kunal Dasgupta, former CEO of Sony's broadcast business in India. ""The media sector is now going through a tough cycle, but things will improve going forward."" Also, Dasgupta said, given the exorbitant valuations, Disney will find it difficult to find a buyer in India. ""In any case, because streaming is the future, the majority of media firms and investors globally are interested in it,"" he said.
According to Nathanson, Disney has two apparent options for its India business. Firstly, they could turn to the newlvy established joint venture led by their former executive (Uday Shankar), and form an even stronger partnership that would de-consolidate India's results and place the asset in more capable and strategic hands.
""We believe there is also a likelihood of Viacom 18 (73% owned by RIL/TV18, 11% TV ad market share), the third largest broadcaster after Zee/Sony and Disney, becoming a strategic partner with Disney India as the former is aggressively seeking to make inroads in media segment,"" said Karan Taurani, senior vice president, Elara Capital.
Alternatively, Disney could explore a potential partnership with Sony, which already has a significant presence in India. Disney in India has also been on the lookout for a buyer for its 30% stake in Tata Play.
Menon said Disney might not exit India because every media company is bullish about this market.

""Based on the votes cast by the members, the special resolution pertaining to reappointment of Alicia Yi as an independent director of the company for a second term of 3 years has failed to receive a requisite number of votes in favour,"" ZEEL said in a late-night regulatory filing on Thursday.
Hence, she vacates the office of independent director with effect from July 13, 2023, it added.
""The board shall take necessary steps for complying with the requirement of the Companies Act, 2013 and Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 for the purpose of having the optimum composition of Board of Directors of the company,"" it said further.
Alicia Yi is Vice Chairman, Consumer Market for Korn Ferry, based in Singapore.

In 2021, ZEEL announced that it will merge with
Culver Max Entertainment
(earlier known as
Sony Pictures Networks
India).
It has received approval from stakeholders and creditors and fair trade regulator CCI.
However, it is yet to receive the final go-ahead from the

""Our appetite for investing in building Prime Video into the default destination remains intact, which should only be possible if we continue to see customers from across the length and breadth of the country joining the platform,""
Sreeram
said.
The Prime Video India chief also said content, distribution, and product are the key growth pillars on which the platform stands.
Speaking about the key content trends, Sreeram said there is a massive expansion of the linguistic palette as 60% of Prime Video customers consume content in four or more languages. He added that half of the viewership for Prime Video’s shows and movies comes from outside their home states.
Not only is Indian content breaking local language barriers, it is also travelling outside India, with a quarter of the total viewership of Prime Video’s Indian original shows happening outside the country among the diaspora and non-diaspora audiences.
Sreeram said Prime Video India’s original crime thriller series ‘Farzi’ is a case in point, as it ranked No. 2 on IMDB among the most popular shows launched globally in 2023. IMDB is owned by Amazon.
He also said international content is finding audiences in India, with 75% of Prime Video viewers watching international shows and movies. Furthermore, 25% of the consumption of international content happens in Indian languages.
Sreeram said Prime Video has also expanded the content selection for its members by launching an aggregation service, Prime Video Channels, in 2021 with eight partners, which has since grown to 18 partners.
""Cumulatively, these 18 partners bring 26,000 hours of additional content selection across shows and movies. Prime Video Channels have also served as the launch pad for some of our channel partners like Stingray, AMC+ and Acorn TV,"" he added.
He said Prime Video’s movie rental service, which boasts a library of over 4,000 movies, has seen customers from 95% of the pin codes rent a movie. ""Almost 90% of our movie rental library is rented at least once every month,"" Sreeram said.

"Higher ad spends, falling newsprint cost to improve print revenues, profitability in FY24: Crisil",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/higher-ad-spends-falling-newsprint-cost-to-improve-print-revenues-profitability-in-fy24-crisil/articleshow/101661656.cms,07-09-2023,"Print
media
revenue is anticipated to increase 13–15% to Rs 30,000 crore this fiscal year due to higher spending on advertising by corporations in key sectors and an increase in government ad spending in light of the forthcoming state and parliamentary elections, according to a
Crisil
report.
The
profitability
of the print media sector will increase by 1,000 basis points (bps) to 14.5% this fiscal year as a result of rising topline and falling
newsprint
prices. The growth predictions are based on an analysis of Crisil-rated print media companies, which generate more than 40% of the industry's revenue.
The sector's revenue plummeted by 40% in FY21 due to the pandemic. However, FY22 and FY23 saw it bounce back by 25% and 15%, respectively, as pent-up demand released by the economic recovery boosted ad spend.
Print publications generate 70% of their revenue from advertising, with subscriptions making up the remaining 30%, according to Crisil.
Crisil Ratings Director Naveen Vaidyanathan said the steadfast domestic demand for fast-moving consumer goods, retail, clothing, and fashion jewelry, the launches of new automobiles, the rising preference for higher education, online shopping, and growing real estate sales bodes well for the print media sector.

He added that these industries, which account for around two-thirds of print media's ad revenue growth, will maintain the current trend. He stated that higher ad spending by the government, which contributes a fifth of the sector’s ad pie, in the wake of the upcoming elections will also push growth.
""We expect ad revenue to grow 15–17%, almost reaching the pre-pandemic level this fiscal,"" Vaidyanathan said.
According to Crisil, the continued recovery shows the popularity of print media in India. It benefits from affordable cover pricing, easy home delivery, the capacity to deliver authentic and unique content, and ingrained reading habits.
It stated that a significant share of readers continues to prefer physical newspapers, as reflected in the 8–10% growth in subscription revenue in each of the past two fiscal years. This fiscal year, subscription revenue is expected to grow by 5–7%, largely led by moderate revisions in cover prices.
English newspapers, which have been feeling the heat of digital competition more than the vernacular ones, have started monetising premium digital content, which is seeing good traction, the rating agency stated.
It pointed out that subscription growth has a bearing on the profitability of print media companies because of the increased requirement for newsprint, the key raw material for the production of newspapers.
More than half of India's newsprint requirements are imported. Russia, which is a major supplier of newsprint, has been at war with Ukraine since late February 2022. Newsprint prices increased in the previous fiscal year as freight charges increased due to logistical bottlenecks caused by the conflict's escalation.
“The Crisil report provides a fair outlook for the industry in the upcoming months, which will definitely have a positive impact on business. We have already seen buoyant volume growth in categories like Consumer Durables, Education, Travel, Tourism, and Government, which is further expected to grow with state and general elections planned. We look forward to double-digit growth and improved profitability in this fiscal,"" said BCCL CEO - Publishing Sivakumar Sundaram.
Crisil Ratings Team Leader Rounak Agarwal stated that the steep surge in newsprint prices sheared 850 bps off the operating margins of print media companies to 4.5% last fiscal year even though revenue increased.
""However, newsprint prices have come down in recent months—correcting as much as 15-20% from the peak last fiscal year—owing to modest global demand and the easing of supply chain issues. This, along with revenue growth, should shore up margins by 1,000 bps to 14.5% this fiscal on a low base from last fiscal. Over the medium term, margins should remain healthy but below the steady-state margins of >20% seen in the past,"" he added.

The association's second requisition notice has the backing of 12.7% of the shareholders, compared with 10.15% earlier, said Rahul Hingmire, the association's spokesperson. ""We have 92 shareholders holding around 23.38 crore shares of Dish TV. Earlier, we had the support of 77 shareholders. More and more shareholders are joining us,"" he said.
Hingmire also said that the association doesn't agree with Dish TV's position on rejecting the first requisition notice. ""We have made it clear that Dish TV's interpretation of the requisition notice is incorrect from a legal standpoint,"" he said.
In their requisition notice, the shareholders have also raised concerns over how the management has been rejecting legitimate requests for holding an EGM. It also highlighted other corporate governance problems, such as the failure to disclose
AGM
results in a timely manner.
The shareholders have also raised concerns about Dish TV's financial performance in the last few years. Dish TV had earlier stated that it would become a debt-free company soon.

Broadcasters eye BCCI meeting outcome on billion-dollar media rights for Indian cricket team's bilaterals,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/broadcasters-eye-bcci-meeting-outcome-on-billion-dollar-media-rights-for-indian-cricket-teams-bilaterals/articleshow/101566086.cms,07-07-2023,"India's big media companies including Disney Star, Reliance-owned Viacom 18 and others are up on toes as the
Board of Control for Cricket in India
will hold a key meet today to likely decide on over-a-billion dollar worth media rights, among other issues.
BCCI
, the world's richest cricket board, will hold an Apex Council Meeting today and may decide on the distribution of the media rights for India's bilaterals for possibly the next four years. Disney Star held the rights till March, and thus India does not have a broadcaster for their bilateral games played here.
""The tender will be coming out soon. We’re planning to close the media rights process by August end,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah had said earlier this week.
Officials from a top media company and a potential bidder said the tender is not out yet.
Industry experts had told ET that the media rights of BCCI could generate more than Rs 10,000 crore, or $1.2 billion at the current exchange rate, while Disney Star, Sony-Zee, Viacom 18, and smaller media players are expected to invest more than $11 billion on marquee cricket properties during the 2023–2027 cycle, officials and analysts said.

In 2018,
Star Sports
India had outbid
Reliance
and Sony to win the
BCCI media rights
, for both television and digital platforms, for Rs 6138.1 crore. The rights were for the period of 2018 to 2023.
Disney Star, that has an array of sports channels both in SD and HD format and offers commentary in regional languages, holds the rights to broadcast and stream matches on TV and on its digital platform for all ICC events. It also has the rights for the Asia Cup till this year.
However, for the first time this year the BCCI had split the TV and digital rights of IPL from 2023-2027 to eventually garner a whopping Rs 48,390 crore in total from Disney Star and Mukesh Ambani's flagship OTT platform JioCinema.
Disney Star bagged the TV rights for Rs 23,575 crore and Reliance-backed Viacom18 got digital rights for Rs 23,758 crore.
Industry experts are of the view that media companies may have a cautious approach while bidding for BCCI media rights, considering that they have already committed $9 billion towards IPL and ICC rights.
While sources had said earlier that BCCI will repeat this money-spinning split move, a key hurdle for the board however was to decide on they will package the rights for India's future bilaterals.
ET had reported earlier that BCCI will unbundle television broadcasting and digital rights for India’s future bilateral series. Some industry experts had said the property will be valued in excess of Rs 15,000 crore, or nearly $2 billion, for the next four- or five-year bloc.
However, a source told ET Online that the mix of the formats (Tests, ODIs & T20Is) in the future fixture will determine the valuation. BCCI is also said to be still working on if they will opt for e-auction or other modes. BCCI may also separate the rights of men's and women's rights following the launch of Women's
Premier
League that saw some commercial value.
Jay Shah had earlier confirmed that the sale of media rights will begin in July, and the tender will be floated sometime this month.
BCCI was reportedly also waiting for the conclusion of the ZEE-Sony merger before opening the bids for its media rights, but a Sebi order has now thrown a spanner in the wheels of the merger that will create a $10 billion media giant.

"Zee Entertainment, IndusInd settle payments issue, NCLAT disposes of appeal",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-entertainment-indusind-settle-payments-issue-nclat-disposes-of-appeal/articleshow/101451320.cms,03-07-2023,"Zee
Entertainment and
IndusInd Bank
on Monday announced that all the due payments have been settled between the two entities, as per media reports. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
) has disposed of the appeal.
The two companies had informed NCLAT that they have reached a settlement in relation to their payment dispute, paving way for the Sony deal, in March 2023.
IndusInd Bank had approached the bankruptcy court in February, seeking to start insolvency proceedings against Zee, a move which could have threatened the merger by stopping all transactions, including asset transfers.
IndusInd Bank, in its plea, claimed a default of Rs 83.08 crore against the media and entertainment firm promoted by Subhash Chandra.
In December 2021, Sony and Zee signed a merger deal to combine their linear networks, digital assets, production operations, and program libraries. However, the deal has been delayed due to reasons including a legal battle with lenders over loan defaults by a Zee group entity.

The Sebi, on June 12, had restrained both, Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka, from holding any directorship or key managerial positions in listed entities on account of alleged fund diversion in an ex-parte interim order. This ban was challenged by Chandra, Goenka. However, SAT on June 27 had reserved its order on the petitions filed by the two individuals challenging Sebi's interim order.
Goenka, in an exclusive interview with the Economic Times, had asserted that the merger between ZEE Entertainment and Sony will go through. ""The ZEE-Sony merger holds immense significance, regardless of my position as CEO. The resulting entity will be under Sony's control, and they have chosen to retain me as a promoter, MD, and CEO,"" he had said.
The NCLAT, an appeals court, had halted the insolvency proceedings against the media company last month.
A lawyer representing Zee told NCLAT that the Sony deal had received all necessary approvals but would be stalled because of the initiation of corporate insolvency proceedings.
The merger, which has been in the making longer than the timelines originally indicated by Zee, had been approved by Zee’s shareholders and India’s antitrust regulator.

Reliance Broadcast Network Ltd
(RBNL). Though
Zee Media Corporation Ltd
(
ZMCL
), earlier known as

, has not specified any reason in a notice to bourses but said it will not participate in the resolution plan of RBNL.
""We would like to inform you that the Company has withdrawn its EOI filed with the CIRP on June 27, 2023, and accordingly the Company shall not be participating in the resolution plan of RBNL,"" the company said.
Earlier on May 5, the board of ZMCL had granted the approval to the company to submit EOI with the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Professional ('CIRP') of RBNL.
Earlier this year in February, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) had directed to initiate CIRP against RBNL, which operates the Big FM radio network.
The NCLT order came over a petition filed by

SAT reserves order in Zee promoters' plea against Sebi,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sat-reserves-order-in-zee-promoters-plea-against-sebi/articleshow/101318839.cms,28-06-2023,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (
SAT
) on Tuesday reserved its order in applications filed by
Subhash Chandra
and his son Punit Goenka challenging the capital market regulator's interim order that restrained them from holding directorship or key managerial positions in listed entities.
The bench presided over by judicial member
Tarun Agarwala
and technical member
Meera Swarup
reserved the order after hearing all arguments.
The father-son duo approached SAT on June 13, challenging an interim order passed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on June 12.
Appearing for Sebi, senior counsel Darius
Khambata
argued that the regulator has found a series of transactions that took place where related parties were involved, and such transactions are undisputed. ""We gave them 21 days to come to us and explain, but they came here, and they are saying they are not here on merit but on the process,"" Khambata said. ""The appellants, instead of rushing to the appellate tribunal, could have come to Sebi to present their case when the time was given to them.""
Goenka's counsel, senior advocate Janak
Dwarkadas
, contended that Sebi has no evidence other than bank statements. He also stated that the market regulator's conclusion that the fund repayments by
Essel Group
entities to ZEEL are mere book entries and bogus is without any basis.

Chandra and Goenka argued Sebi did not issue a show-cause notice to them before passing the order. They also argued Sebi did not follow the principles of natural justice while issuing the order.

""All entities through which Sebi alleges round-tripping, have genuine business relations with Zee,"" the counsel further added.
Earlier, in its reply to SAT, Sebi had alleged that Chandra and Goenka have diverted public funds to private entities, which calls for urgent action.
""In the instant case, we have a situation before us where the Chairman Emeritus and the Managing Director and CEO of this large listed company are involved in a myriad of different schemes and transactions through which vast amounts of public money belonging to listed companies are diverted to private entities owned and controlled by these persons,"" Sebi said in its affidavit to SAT.
ZEE-Sony Merger
The merger between ZEE Entertainment and the Indian unit of Japan's Sony will go through, ""whether or not"" he is the CEO of the merged company, Punit Goenka told the Economic Times in an interview.
The India markets regulator has imposed a one-year ban on Zee Entertainment's Chairman Subhash Chandra and CEO Goenka for being actively involved in diverting company funds to the group's related entities, raising questions on the future of the Zee-Sony merger.
Goenka was set to become the merged entity's managing director and CEO, leading a $10 billion TV enterprise.
""The ZEE-Sony merger holds immense significance, regardless of my position as CEO. The resulting entity will be under Sony's control, and they have chosen to retain me as a promoter, MD, and CEO,"" Goenka told the Economic Times.
The comments come after Sony said on Wednesday it took the Securities and Exchange Board of India's ban on Chandra and Goenka ""seriously"" and will monitor developments that may affect the deal, which was announced in 2021.

IDBI Trusteeship
Services' petition seeking Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) proceedings against
Essel Group
entity
Cyquator Media Services
for default in payment.
In its petition against Cyquator Media,
IDBI
Trusteeship had invoked the provisions of Section 7 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code read with Rule 4 of Insolvency & Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 for resolution of financial debt worth ₹599 crore.
In their order, the NCLT bench of Technical Member Anuradha Sanjay Bhatia and Judicial Member Kuldip Kumar Kareer noted that the contentions raised on behalf of IDBI Trusteeship are devoid of any force or substance.
""We are of the considered view that in this case, the default took place in the month of June 2020 which is clearly covered under the period excluded under Section 10A of the Code. That being so, the instant Petition cannot be maintained being barred by Section 10A of the Code and is, therefore, dismissed,"" the order reads.
As per the provisions of Section 10A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, no application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process can be filed in respect of a default that has occurred on or after 25th March 2020 till 24th September 2020.

Section 10A was introduced in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown, on March 25, 2020.
NCLT said that the default took place when Cyquator didn't make the payment even after the guarantee was invoked by IDBI Trusteeship vide notice dated June 12, 2020. IDBI counsel had argued that the date of default should be considered as May 13, 2022.
Cyquator Media
was represented by Advocate Nausher Kohli.
The bench, however, clarified that this order will not prevent IBDI Trusteeship from recovering dues from Cyquator before any other competent forum/court of law.
""Nothing observed herein before should be construed to mean that the debt in question has extinguished,"" the order stated.
In 2015, Essel Infra Projects issued 425 rated, unlisted, redeemable, non-convertible debentures in 2 Series, each debenture having a face value of ₹1 crore, aggregating to ₹425 crore on a private placement basis. The date of maturity of the NCDs was May 22, 2020.

Zee's plea against Sebi order: SAT adjourns hearing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zees-plea-against-sebi-order-sat-adjourns-hearing/articleshow/101288104.cms,26-06-2023,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (
SAT
) on Monday adjourned the hearing on Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra and
ZEE
managing director and CEO Punit Goenka's plea to Tuesday.
The Securities & Exchange Board of India (
Sebi
) argued its action was not based on any prejudice towards Chandra and Goenka, but a necessary step against the promoters of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
to protect investors and other stakeholders.
The appellate tribunal is hearing a plea filed by Chandra and Goenka challenging Sebi's interim order barring future directorship and top executive roles in listed entities for the two.
Before Sebi's argument, Somasekhar Sundaresan, appearing for Chandra, argued that there is no mention of Subhash Chandra as a noticee in the famous order of SGRL, on which basis this order was passed.
In April, Sebi issued an interim order-cum-show-cause notice against SGRL, its erstwhile chairman Amit Goenka, promoter Jayneer Infrapower, and Multiventures for allegedly siphoning off funds from the company and violating other rules.

The counsel for Chandra further argued that he was the chairman emeritus, which is an honorary position. ""Such positions are honorary positions and the concept of this position is not alien to corporate India,"" argued counsel for Chandra. ""It is more like Vanprasthashram where the idea is to give such person honour for the lifelong service to the group or the company.""
The bench presided by judicial member Tarun Agarwala and a technical member Meera Swarup, while adjourning the matter to Tuesday, directed that were to be no further filing in the matter.
Meanwhile, in a separate development, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) informed the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the scheme of merger with Sony can go ahead regardless of Sebi's order.
Senior Counsel Janak Dwarkadas, while appearing for the company, told the tribunal that the merger scheme can go ahead whether Goenka remains on the board or not, since the lenders and many other stakeholders have approved the scheme.
The NCLT bench led by judicial member HV Subba Rao and technical member Madhu Sinha has adjourned the hearing for the merger scheme to July 6.
In December 2021, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) and ZEEL signed definitive agreements to merge. Sony will indirectly hold a majority of 50.86% of the combined company, the promoters of ZEEL will hold 3.99%, and other ZEEL shareholders will hold a 45.15% stake.
The Sony-Zee merger has received approvals from BSE, NSE and Competition Commission of India (CCI). Sony expects the merger to conclude by September this year.

The counsel said
Zee Entertainment
Enterprises wanted a stay on the Sebi order.
""All entities through which Sebi alleges round-tripping, have genuine business relations with Zee,"" the counsel further added.
Earlier, in its reply to SAT Sebi had alleged that Chandra and Goenka had diverted public funds to private entities, which calls for urgent action.
""In the instant case, we have a situation before us where the Chairman Emeritus and the Managing Director and CEO of this large listed company are involved in a myriad of different schemes and transactions through which vast amounts of public money belonging to listed companies are diverted to private entities owned and controlled by these persons,"" Sebi said affidavit to SAT.

View: Sony merger plan for Zee turns into farce. Time to walk,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/view-sony-merger-plan-for-zee-turns-into-farce-time-to-walk/articleshow/101128560.cms,20-06-2023,"Sony Group Corp. thought it had a strong script to woo audiences in the world’s most-populous nation, but the merger that was going to make it the leader of India’s television entertainment market was doomed from the start. By pursuing it for almost two years, the Japanese company has become an unwitting actor in a farce. It should cut its losses and walk.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India alleged last week that
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
., the Mumbai-based media house Sony wants to combine with, had faked the recovery of loans owed by its founder Subhash Chandra’s private entities. He and his son Punit Goenka had siphoned off funds “for their own benefit,” the
SEBI
said, barring them from executive or directorial positions in listed firms. Chandra and Goenka, Zee’s chief executive, have appealed the order on the grounds that the regulator didn’t hear their side of the story. The SEBI has doubled down by filing a 197-page reply.
The legal drama creates a fresh problem for Sony. Although it was supposed to control the larger empire, and infuse an additional $1.4 billion of cash, Goenka was to run the show. This is how Chandra, the 72-year-old Indian media mogul, had structured the 2021 transaction so as to retain some sway over Zee, India’s oldest non-state television network.
Chandra had come to that sorry pass because of his wrong-way leveraged bets in unrelated industries like infrastructure, an error he acknowledged in early 2019. But a plan to repay debt by selling half of the family’s stake in
Zee
to a strategic partner failed to kick off. Two years later, a large US investor began a campaign to oust his son as director. At the time, Sony, which competes with Zee in offering a similar fare of Bollywood-style entertainment and sports, was kind to come to the rescue of its rival. Not only was it agreeable to letting Goenka continue as CEO, Sony was also giving the family an option to raise its near-depleted stake to 20% and throwing in extra shares as a non-compete fee.
The television market in India is large, but its best days are in the rear-view mirror. So although the Zee network reaches 750 million people, or six times Japan’s population, every week, its market share of 16.6% is stagnant. The more promising horse in the stable is ZEE5, the streaming service. It has 114 million monthly active users, and posted a 35% jump in sales in the financial year that ended in March. The overall revenue for the company, however, didn’t grow. With programming costs on the rise and advertising in a slump, Ebitda crashed by 38%.

Too much has changed in India in the past two years for Sony to still want the merger on the same terms — or want it at all.
Last June, Viacom18 Media Pvt., a joint venture between Mukesh Ambani’s
Reliance Industries Ltd
. and Paramount Global, spent $2.7 billion to win an exclusive, five-year live-streaming deal for Indian
Premier
League cricket matches. Ambani decided to show this year’s tournament for free, and then went on to sign a pact with
Warner
Bros Discovery Inc. to stream the latter’s exclusive content in India, including the popular series, Succession. Ambani’s petrochemicals-heavy group, which is pivoting toward consumer businesses like telecom, retail, digital content and e-commerce, has already become a formidable media player.
If the deal with Sony falls through, Zee would rue not having sold to Ambani shortly before the hastily cobbled bailout by Sony. Back then, Atlanta-based Invesco Developing Markets Fund was trying to use its then-18% stake in Zee to get CEO Goenka to discuss a potential transaction with Reliance. Those talks went nowhere because a complete exit for the Chandra family would have been an almost certain outcome — Ambani and Manoj Modi, his consigliere, wouldn’t have been as generous to the father-son duo as Sony has turned out to be.
Investors have already lost their enthusiasm.
Zee shares
are down 50% from their high following the September 2021 merger announcement. If the Japanese side sours on the deal now, creditors will most likely make fresh attempts to drag the Indian media house into bankruptcy. Although one such request was turned down by the insolvency tribunal just last month, the SEBI’s interim order has altered the landscape. Sony gets nothing by waiting for regulators’ allegations to do the rounds of the securities appellate tribunal and possibly India’s Supreme Court.
The troubled company had about $100 million of cash in March, but it’s sitting on nearly $1 billion worth of inventory, including movie and music rights and advances. That content and loyal audiences — Zee Music has 134 million YouTube subscribers — are lucrative enough to set off a bidding war for its assets. In trying to preempt such a contest with Ambani, Sony has wasted nearly two years. It’s time to end the farce.

Securities Appellate Tribunal adjourns ZEEL promoters' plea to June 26,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/securities-appellate-tribunal-adjourns-zeel-promoters-plea-to-june-26/articleshow/101114294.cms,19-06-2023,"The
Securities Appellate Tribunal
(SAT) will hear on June 26 the plea of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
Chairman emeritus Subhash Chandra and his son and MD Punit Goenka to set aside the Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) interim order barring them from directorships in listed entities.
On June 12, SEBI passed an interim order barring Subhash Chandra and his son Punit Goenka from holding directorships or managerial positions in a listed company. On June 13, Chandra and Goenka challenged the SEBI interim order before the SAT.
Appearing for Goenka, senior counsel Janak Dwarkadas argued that the petitioners have appealed against an ex-parte order, where the capital markets regulator has said that it is ‘curious’ but has not ‘reached any conclusion’.
""Sebi’s argument is that there are layered transactions, but some of the entities that they have mentioned are totally unconnected entities and not even part of the group,"" argued Dwarkadas. ""They have not cared to go to the websites of some of these companies to see what these companies do.""
The counsel for the petitioner further argued that PAN India Ltd. and Pen were mistaken as the same company by the Sebi.

""The company had paid over Rs 71 crore to Pen India Limited for the rights to show the movie RRR,"" argued Dwarkadas.
The tribunal had last week posted the matter for final disposal on June 19.
While hearing the counsels for Chandra, Goenka, and SEBI, the tribunal stated that passing an interim order at this stage would be virtually allowing the appeals.
The bench of Presiding Officer Justice Tarun Agarwala and Technical Member Meera Swarup had asked SEBI to file a reply on or before 2 p.m. on June 17. Rejoinder, if any, was to be filed on or before June 19, 2023.
In its affidavit to the SAT, the SEBI stated that
ZEEL
chairman-emeritus Subhash Chandra and MD Punit Goenka are involved in a myriad of different schemes and transactions through which vast amounts of public money belonging to listed companies are diverted to private entities owned and controlled by these persons.
Last week, ZEEL had also written to Sebi, stating that ""continuous and repetitive"" inquiries into the same cause of action damage the company and shareholders. It added that the inquiries might also have an effect on the company's merger process with
Sony Pictures Networks
India (SPNI).
Sebi has already given its no-objection certificate to the merger scheme between ZEEL and SPNI. As part of the merger deal,
Sony Pictures Entertainment
, the parent company of SPNI, will also infuse $1.57 billion into the merged entity.
In December 2021, SPNI and ZEEL signed definitive agreements to merge their assets. The merger will create a media and broadcasting behemoth worth $10 billion.
As part of the deal, Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) will indirectly hold a majority of 50.86% of the combined company, the promoters of ZEEL will hold 3.99%, and the other ZEEL shareholders will hold a 45.15% stake.
The merger has been approved by BSE and NSE. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has also given conditional approval to the merger. To address possible anti-competition concerns arising out of their proposed mega-merger deal, ZEEL has agreed to sell three Hindi channels: Big Magic, Zed Action, and Zed Classic.

June 16: SAT gives Sebi 48 hours to file a reply to a plea filed by ZEE promoters, challenging the regulator's interim order
June 18: Sebi informs SAT Chandra and Goenka had diverted public funds to private entities, calls for urgent action
June 18: Zee writes to Sebi, says 'continuous and repetitive' investigations can impact merger with Sony
In a letter to the markets regulator SEBI, it said that ""continuous and repetitive"" investigations on the same cause of action creates prejudice for the Company and Shareholders, and can potentially impact the merger process.
In a letter to SEBI, Zee said, ""please note that the said merger is at an advanced stage post receipt approvals from various regulators (including SEBI, Stock Exchanges and CCI etc.) and the scheme is also approved by 99.9 percent of the equity shareholders of ZEEL"".
Zee said it may also be noted that the transactions in the present matter pertain to the year 2019 and a detailed explanation has already been provided to Stock Exchanges and SEBI.
""It is beyond our comprehension as to why the present matter is being re-investigating/re-examining, when the cause of action pertaining to the matter is around 4 years old,"" the company said.
News agency IANS reported that Sony's board of directors is said to be unhappy with developments and is looking at invoking force majeure and material adverse clause in the shareholder agreement in the proposed merger with
Zee Entertainment
in India.
SEBI has given a No Objection Certificate (
NOC
) to the Composite Scheme of Merger in the matter of ZEEL and Sony Pictures Networks India Pvt. Ltd. (Sony), which is one of the largest integrations of industry majors in the media industry and entails an incoming foreign direct investment of $1.7 billion (approx.) into India.

Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation
(
IBDF
) has written to the
department of telecom
(DoT) to reiterate its position that it is not possible to divide the C-band spectrum in the 3700-4200 MHz range between terrestrial 5G carriers and satellite services.
The letter from IBDF secretary general Siddharth Jain to DoT secretary (telecom)
K Rajaraman
dated June 15 follows one from the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) on June 8, asking for information and views from a select group of broadcasters and teleport operators regarding the government's proposal to move Indian broadcasting from the current frequency band of 3700-4200 MHz to 4000-4200 MHz.
Opposing this proposal, IBDF said low-noise blocks (LNBs) of all receivers will get overloaded and weak satellite signals will get obliterated once high-power 5G transmissions start within the current C-Band of 3,700-4,200 MHz. A large number of channels in the 3700-3800 MHz band, including the ones using GSAT satellites such as GSAT-30, will become defunct if the broadcasters are moved to the 4000-4200 MHz band, it said.
ET has seen a copy of the letter. IBDF said the government's plans to offer 300 MHz in the 3700-4200 band to telecom operators will impact over 100 TV channels that use the 3800-4000 MHz frequency range. It also highlighted that the planned migration of over 60 channels to safe bands above 3800 MHz has come to a naught due to a scarcity of capacity.

The apex TV broadcast body noted that issues regarding the use of spectrum up to 3670 MHz have not yet been resolved. It added that there have been sporadic instances of disturbance in broadcast services due to interference from telecom signals. The government has allotted the 3300-3670 MHz band to telecom operators for 5G service rollout.
The broadcasters had earlier sought a 100 MHz guard band between 3600 MHz and 3700 MHz for the smooth functioning of the broadcast services. The government extended the frequency band for 5G services up to 3670 MHz, notwithstanding the industry's request. Broadcasters use the 3700-4200 frequency band for providing satellite broadcasting services.

"ZEE-Sony Merger: Chairman Emeritus, MD of large listed company diverted public money, says SEBI",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-sony-merger-chairman-emeritus-md-of-large-listed-company-diverted-public-money-says-sebi/articleshow/101084866.cms,18-06-2023,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in its reply in the matter of
Zee Enterprises
to Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has pointed out that Chairman Emeritus Subhash Chandra and Managing Director and CEO Punit Goenka of this large listed company have diverted public money to private entities.
""In the instant case, we have a situation before us where the Chairman Emeritus and the Managing Director and CEO of this large listed company are involved in a myriad of different schemes and transactions through which vast amounts of public money belonging to listed companies are diverted to private entities owned and controlled by these persons,"" IANS quoted SEBI as saying in its reply to SAT.
Meanwhile,
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEE) has written also to SEBI that ""continuous and repetitive"" investigations on the same cause of action creates prejudice for the Company and Shareholders, and can potentially impact the merger process.
SEBI has given a No Objection Certificate ('NOC') to the Composite Scheme of Merger in the matter of
ZEEL
and Sony Pictures Networks India Pvt. Ltd. ('Sony'), which is one of the largest integrations of industry majors in the media industry and entails an incoming foreign direct investment of USD 1.7 billion (approx.) into India.
In a letter to SEBI,
Zee
said, ""Please note that the said merger is at an advanced stage post receipt approvals from various regulators (including SEBI, Stock Exchanges and CCI etc.) and the scheme is also approved by 99.9 per cent of the equity shareholders of ZEEL.""

Zee said, ""It may also be noted that the transactions in the present matter pertain to the year 2019 and a detailed explanation has already been provided to Stock Exchanges and SEBI.
""It is beyond our comprehension as to why the present matter is being re-investigating/re-examining, when the cause of action pertaining to the matter is around 4 years old,"" the company said.
""It is submitted that we were never privy to the loan arrangements between Borrower Entities and
Yes bank
or the loan amount involved. There was no privity of contract between the Yes Bank, ZEEL and the Borrowing entities. The misappropriation of ZEEL's FD was the result of the unilateral action of YBL without any action on part of the ZEEL.
""It is submitted that ZEEL happens to itself be a victim of the misappropriation by Yes Bank. Therefore, pursuant to the misappropriation, ZEEL has taken every step to ensure that money is recovered and no loss is cause to the shareholders, thereby acting in the interest of the shareholders,"" the company said.
Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka have moved SAT against the SEBI order barring them from holding director positions or key management personnel in any listed company on allged siphoning of funds from Zee Enterprises.
""The Appellant's conduct is telling in this regard. Not only have there been violations but also the issuance of multiple false disclosures and submission of statements to cover up such wrongdoings. In Shirpur, we have also seen that the promoter group timed its offloading of shares in the open market to avoid bearing the brunt of the fall in the market value of Shirpur's shares. It is ultimately the small retail investors who endured the downfall in share price,"" SEBI added.
ZEEL is one of the top 200 largest listed companies in India today having large number of public shareholders and retail investors and therefore, occupies a prominent position in the Indian securities market.
SEBI said as noted in the impugned order that the Appellants created a facade through sham entries to misrepresent to the investors as well as the regulator that the money had been returned by Seven Related Companies, whereas in reality, it was ZEEL's own funds which rotated through multiple layers to finally end in ZEEL's account. These facts reasonably warrant urgent action on the part of the Respondent to safeguard the management of such companies and protect their investors and other stakeholders.
In fact, if during a preliminary examination, it is found prima facie that the person is indulging in manipulation of the securities market, SEBI is obliged to pass an ex-parte ad interim order to safeguard the interest of investors and protect the integrity of the securities market.
It is undoubtedly evident from the manner in which monies flowed from one promoter company to another that the monies of ZEEL and other listed companies have been used by the promoters to give the false impression that the Seven Related Parties have repaid the amount of Rs 200 crore (appropriated by Yes Bank) to ZEEL.
In fact, an analysis of the transactions evinces that the transfers occurred between the conduit (middlemen) entities on the same date or consecutive days in a sequential fashion and at very quick intervals (within seconds and minutes), indicating that these transactions are not bonafide in nature but that these transfers were only for the purpose of funnelling money to the Seven Related Parties so that they could make
payment
to ZEEL of the amounts appropriated by Yes Bank, SEBI said.

"Reducing C-band spectrum will hurt business, broadcasters tell MIB",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/reducing-c-band-spectrum-will-hurt-business-broadcasters-tell-mib/articleshow/101046697.cms,16-06-2023,"Broadcasters
and teleport operators have told the
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
(
MIB
) that any move to reduce the bandwidth available to C-band communication satellites from 500 MHz to 200 MHz will hurt their business.
Currently, the
C-band spectrum
in the 3700-4200 MHz range is allotted to broadcasting services.
The MIB had last week sought information from broadcasters and teleport operators on whether their current and future assignments can be accommodated within 4000-4200 MHz.
The industry opined that reducing the C-band spectrum will have ramifications for the business of the sector as they will need to make investments in additional teleports because the current network will not be sufficient for accommodating existing and additional
TV channels
in 4000-4200 MHz.
The Department of Telecom (DoT) plans to open the 3700-4200 MHz spectrum band for telecom operators to use for providing 5G/6G services.
Live Events
In their submission to the MIB, the broadcasters and teleport operators have said reducing the bandwidth on C-Band to 200 MHz spectrum (4000-4200 MHz) will lead to a 60% reduction in the capacity for the sector, which translates to 40 transponders. Furthermore, the stakeholders stated that the industry will have to migrate to higher frequencies.
The industry stakeholders also submitted that migrating TV channels using C-band spectrum in the range of 3700–4200 MHZ to 4000–4200 MHz range is not feasible. They also contended that the 4000–4200 MHz spectrum can only support 10 transponders. Therefore, 40 transponders would need another five satellites hypothetically in the 4000-4200 MHz band.
The stakeholders have also claimed that adding more capacity will take at least 10 years and that no satellite operator will build capacity for the smaller size of the C-band spectrum.
Broadband India Forum president T V Ramachandran said the broadcasters and teleport operators are the longstanding legitimate incumbents of this spectrum and have been using it for public broadcasting and entertainment while meeting all their licence obligations and duties.
“A massive 60% reduction in capacity is involved in this band change, which would significantly deteriorate the quality of service to consumers and lead to an increase in cost per channel,” he stated.
The DoT's decision to make C-band spectrum available for telecom services, according to a top executive at a major TV broadcasting business, is being made to appease the telecom lobby without realizing that it will completely destroy the broadcasting industry.
""There is a serious question mark over the future of broadcasting in India, in particular news channels and smaller broadcasters. This will also pave the way for the creation of a vertically integrated entity spread across the telecom and broadcasting sectors, for which at the moment there is a policy and regulatory void to prevent the emergence of such a monopoly,"" the executive added.Furthermore, the broadcasters said, reducing or limiting the C-band spectrum will create congestion as the demand for the 4000-4200 MHz bandwidth will go up.
They suggested that the government use millimeter waves for 5G or any other vacant frequency bands as that would not disturb the broadcast industry.
Recently, the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF) had also requested the government against auctioning spectrum in the C-band (3700 to 4200 MHz) since the same has been allocated for broadcasting services, and opening this band for 5G/6G services will disrupt the TV broadcasting sector due to the likely interference of terrestrial transmissions with the satellite signals.

""At least 90% of the people we hired in the last year are in transformation areas,"" Gupte said, adding that media planning continues to be the core of the agency. He also said GroupM has the lowest attrition rate in the media agency ecosystem, and within that, Wavemaker has the lowest attrition rate.
Wavemaker India, which has 800 employees across five offices, is part of GroupM, the media investment arm of advertising behemoth WPP.
Davies claimed that due to the aggressive compensation packages offered by these businesses, media agencies have been losing talent to tech behemoths like
Meta
, Google, and Amazon.
""Some of that talent has come back because they have very narrow roles in those companies, whereas in agencies you have a lot more latitude to work across various things,"" Davies stated.
He also stated that the agency has set a global target of earning 25% of its revenue from diversified services.
""The media agency business is in good shape. We started the year with a $4.5 billion pipeline, which is all the live pitches we have in the world,"" Davies said.
The ad veteran said India is one of the most important markets for Wavemaker both strategically and commercially due to its demographics and the fact that there is a massive opportunity to build new brands.

The case pertains to Chandra, who was also the chairman of ZEEL during the alleged violation, and Goenka having abused their position as directors or KMPs of a listed company for siphoning off funds for their own benefit.
Sebi had stated that the siphoning of funds appears to be a well-planned scheme since, in some instances, the layering of transactions involved using as many as 13 entities as pass-through entities within a short period of two days only.
On Monday, in a statement, ZEEL Chairman R Gopalan stated that the company's board was ""in the process of reviewing the detailed order, and appropriate legal advice is being sought in order to take the next steps as required"".
""All the appropriate steps will be actioned as necessary, in order to ensure that the interest of the company and all its valuable shareholders is kept at the forefront,"" he said adding, with a singular focus on enhancing the shareholder value year after year, the board has continued to guide the management towards its strategic goals and priorities for the future.
Gopalan also added that the board recognises the significant contribution made by Chandra as the founder of the company and the growth and value generation-centric leadership showcased by Goenka.

Securities and Exchange Board of India
(
SEBI
) order and seeking the appropriate legal counsel before moving forward.
“The Board of Directors of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
. (ZEEL) has noted the interim ex-parte order issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), with respect to Dr.
Subhash Chandra
and Mr.
Punit Goenka
,"" Gopalan said in a statement.
""The Board is currently in the process of reviewing the detailed order, and appropriate legal advice is being sought in order to take the next steps as required,"" he added.
India’s capital market regulator barred
Essel Group
chairman Subhash Chandra Goenka and his son Punit Goenka, the MD, and CEO of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), from holding any directorship or key managerial positions in any listed company in an interim order issued late on Monday.
The SEBI order followed an investigation that found the two had abused their board positions in Zee by “siphoning off funds for their own benefit,” the regulator said. The regulator has directed Zee to place the order before its board within seven days. The
Goenkas
have 21 days to respond to Sebi’s order.
Live Events
Legal experts say that the development could delay Zee’s proposed merger with
Sony Pictures Networks
India (SPNI), now known as Culver Max Entertainment. They also add that the Sebi order also means Goenka may not be able to hold a senior role in the Zee-Sony merged entity.
Gopalan said that the company's board has continued to direct management toward its long-term strategic goals and priorities with a single emphasis on increasing shareholder value every year.
""All the appropriate steps will be actioned as necessary, in order to ensure that the interest of the Company and all its valuable shareholders is kept at the forefront,"" he added.
He also said that the board recognises the significant contribution made by Dr. Subhash Chandra as the founder of the Company and the growth and value generation-centric leadership showcased by Punit Goenka.
""The Board is confident that the Company, will continue to achieve the set goals for the future and most above, create value for all stakeholders,"" he stated.

""Cricket makes perfect sense for us since our target is the male audience over 35 years of age. Cricket continues to have a lot of interest among fans. There is a different following for Test matches,"" said Chandramohan Mehra, Chief Marketing Officer,
Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance
.
Mehra added that the ad rates for WTC differ from client to client. He noted that the advertisers only get invoiced for the inventory that they consume.
""We have collaborated with advertisers from various domains across Star Sports and Disney+ Hotstar to help them achieve their desired business objectives through this marquee event. The response has been overwhelming so far, resulting in the sale of all key features well in advance. We are optimistic about delivering an exhilarating tournament experience to our valued advertisers,"" said Ajit Varghese, Disney Star's head of Network and Ad Sales.

India
as among its key markets, a top executive said.
""For anyone globally,
APAC
is an important region in the long term,"" said Josh Gallagher (in pic), Asia-Pacific chief operating officer of EssenceMediacom that manages advertisement billings of more than $21 billion a year globally. ""Even if North America is important from a volume perspective, APAC will have a role to play in innovation,"" he added.
India is a key market for EssenceMediacom due to the quality of work that is coming out of the country, he said.
""Within APAC, it's not as much around the volume of work as it is around the quality of work and the quality of services that we have in India. Our client base in India is a mix of global and local clients. That's the big benefit in terms of the type of work that we can do here,"" Gallagher said.
While noting that clients are treading cautiously on spending money on advertising due to the global economic uncertainty, he said the silver lining is that the consumers are actively spending money. ""Ad growth across the region will not see a dip,"" he added.

She said India has become a separate line item in the profit and loss accounts of most agencies. She also said the agency has won some category-defining businesses during the last 3-4 months.

"Disney+ Hotstar to stream World Cup, Asia Cup for free to half a billion smartphone users in India",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-hotstar-to-stream-world-cup-asia-cup-for-free-to-half-a-billion-smartphone-users-in-india/articleshow/100868426.cms,09-06-2023,"Disney+ Hotstar on Friday said more than half-a-billion smartphone users in
India
will be able to watch this year's
Asia Cup
and ICC Men’s Cricket
World Cup
for free on the OTT platform.
""The move to lift the paywall for mobile-only viewers of both, the Asia Cup and the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup, is aimed at further democratizing the game of cricket and making it accessible to as many mobile users in India as possible for the duration of the season,"" the company said in a release.
More than 540 million smartphone users across India will have the opportunity to watch the Asia Cup and ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup for free, it added.
Disney+ Hotstar has also enabled free streaming for tablets.
Asia Cup 2023 is scheduled to be held during September in cricket-crazy India and the Asian nation will also host the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup spanning nearly two months from October 5 to November 19. While Asia Cup has 13 matches scheduled, World Cup will see 10 countries fighting for the coveted trophy and there are a total of 48 matches scheduled.

Both the events will see a deluge of viewers, with Asia Cup already garnering interest amid controversy of the Pakistan cricket team visiting India while the once-in-four years event World Cup is the top product for 50-overs ricket matches.
This also comes after marquee Indian
Premier
League this year set record viewership numbers for both television and digital platforms. However, BCCI had split the media rights for
IPL
for the first time, where
Disney Star
picked the TV rights and billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani's
JioCinema
had the digital rights.
JioCinema had streamed the IPL matches for free on the digital platforms.
""Offering the most expensive content, free of cost has caused disruption in the fragmented and price-sensitive India OTT market, as Jio Cinema has been unable to recover more than 35% of its content cost by going pure advertising-based video on demand (AVOD), in line with our expectations,"" said Karan Taurani, senior vice president - research analyst (media, consumer discretionary & internet) at Elara Capital.

'Record 32 million viewers watched IPL final match on the JioCinema app'
Taurani also said the move by Disney+ Hotstar to offer cricket content free to mobile subscribers, if continued over the medium term, may result in higher losses for over-the-top (OTT) platforms and lead to consolidation, as many may be unable to survive with low ARPU and free offerings. ""In our view, this move will negatively impact subscription revenue growth for global/broadcaster led OTT platforms which are SVOD/freemium based respectively,"" he added.
Disney Star had earlier said that IPL has become the first cricket tournament to register over half a billion viewers of the live broadcast on TV.
Making the two upcoming marquee cricketing events stream for free, Disney+ Hotstar hopes to register strong digital viewership in the world's most populous country.
Elara's Taurani said offering premium content free does not augur well, as they believe freemium is the best way ahead for India's OTT market that already deals with challenges like lower ARPU on OTT, high content cost, fragmented OTT market, and dominance of social, search and commerce in the ad market.

Making the Asia Cup and ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup available to a wider audience, we believe, will help us grow the overall eco-system,” said Sajith Sivanandan, Head of Disney+ Hotstar.

Premier
League has allowed both the the broadcaster and streaming partners to garner record viewership on their respective platforms, after the country's cricket board had for the first time split the media rights for the world's second richest league.
Disney Star
, the official television broadcaster of IPL, said an astounding 50.5 crore viewers tuned in to watch the live broadcast of T20 matches on television and the number for total viewers, including coverages around matches and highlights, stood at 53.5 crore.
JioCinema, the official streaming partner, said a record 44.9 crore of total viewers tuned in on the OTT platform for IPL coverage. It said connected TV adoption scaled up rapidly this season, with more than 12.6 crore viewers logging in to
JioCinema
to watch IPL.
The tournament was played in India after three years and the grounds opened their gates for all spectators, who were a big miss in recent Covid-stricken years. The cash-rich tournament has now become a decacorn with a $10.9 billion valuation and is said to be the country’s first unicorn in 2008 at $1.1 billion in valuation at inception, according to an analysis by D&P Advisory. A KPMG survey had reported that the tournament contributed Rs 11.5 billion ($182 million) to the domestic economy in 2021, even when played within confines adhering to Covid protocols.
Disney Star said IPL has become the first cricket tournament to register over half a billion viewers of the live broadcast on TV.

""From last ball nail-biters to high-scoring thrillers, from the addition of the impact player rule to the emergence of future stars, from the last spot on the playoffs being decided in the last league stage match to the tournament winner being decided on the final ball, this edition of IPL has been special in many ways. Countless memories will be etched in cricket history including the fact that is the first time that half a billion viewers tuned in for a Cricket tournament,” said Sanjog Gupta, Head – Sports at Disney Star.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had set up a rivalry outside the ground starting this IPL between Disney Star and Mukesh Ambani's flagship OTT platform JioCinema after it split the TV and digital rights of IPL from 2023-2027 to eventually garner a whopping Rs 48,390 crore in total.
Disney Star bagged the TV rights for Rs 23,575 crore and Reliance-backed Viacom18 got digital rights for Rs 23,758 crore.
Disney Star said it accumulated 4,271 crore minutes of watch time for the live broadcast of the matches and it witnessed a remarkable growth of 32% in match TVR* compared to the last edition, the broadcaster said citing BARC data.
The final match between GT and CSK registered a peak concurrency of 6.41 crores - the highest for
IPL 2023
. Additionally, 47 out of 74 matches registered peak concurrency of more than three crores.
Disney Star broadcasted the
IPL matches
on their
Star Sports
channels in English, Hindi and several regional languages. The broadcaster had also launched new HD
South Indian
language channels for broadcasting IPL and also played up the region-specific themes.
The broadcaster also launched interactive features on TV sets, allowing viewers to watch match highlights at any time, fix cameras on their favorite stars or get real-time subtitles of commentary at the click of a button.
The broadcaster has reached new heights in high-definition (HD) broadcasting, with an incredible 101 million viewers tuning in to the HD broadcast, it said. This number is three times higher compared to last year, demonstrating the growing preference for high-definition sports viewing.
JioCinema, which was streaming IPL for the first time, also offered commentaries in several regional languages, apart from English and implemented interactive features ranging from live quizzes, multi-mode camera to access to all stats of a match at the press of a button.
Backed by Viacom 18, JioCinema streamed IPL on mobiles, tablets, laptops/desktops and Connected TVs. The OTT platform streamed the world's second richest league for free in 4k mode.
For the final match, which MS Dhoni-led Chennai Super Kings won by five wickets in a rain-hit match against the Gujarat Titans, the concurrent viewership on JioCinema recorded 32 million, beating its previous record of 25.7 million viewers for the second qualifier between Gujarat Titans and Mumbai Indians.
The average time spent per viewer per match across the tournament on Connected TVs with JioCinema was 65 minutes, the company said.
The total numbers for television viewing exceeds that of OTT. This is on expected lines given India's muted fast-Internet reach, expensive data and most importantly, lower smartphone penetration compared to TV sets.
Industry reports of EY-FICCI and Affle have confirmed that the smartphone penetration in India is close to 460 million, which is just half of the television penetration in India. Data cost is another major factor that is likely to slow down the interest to watch matches on OTTs.
However, experts opined that Asia’s richest tycoon Mukesh Ambani's OTT platform streaming the IPL this time wasn't aiming to win all viewers. He is keen to plant a dominant position for consumer super-apps while his flagship telecom company attracts customers from Sunil Mittal's Bharti Airtel and financially strained Vodafone Idea.
Ambani is also seen close to listing Jio Platforms on the stock indices.

, the official broadcaster and streaming partner for ICC events, has roped in 28 sponsors for the clash of the titans - India and Australia - in the ICC World Test Championship final match, which is anticipated to garner high viewership.
The
Star Sports
Network has roped in 15 sponsors and Disney+ Hotstar has added 13 sponsors across categories ahead of the battle between the cricket rivals that gets underway from June 7 – 11, the company said. Star Sports has onboarded more than 45 brands for the final match that will crown the best team in test cricket.
Increased interest to put money in the test championship final comes at a time when red-ball cricket has been facing tough blows from the galloping craze for the shorter formats of the game. The test match also comes close on the heels of the Indian
Premier
League that broke several viewership records this year and attracted a big pool of money from sponsors to cash in from the cash-rich league.
In fact, Indians will also watch the game from the same network on both television and digital platforms, after BCCI had split the media rights for IPL between Reliance's Viacom18 and Disney Star.
What's there for sponsors to cash in on?

India Vs Australia WTC Final: Where to watch WTC Final 2023 on TV and online live streaming
While there isn’t a ballpark number for the number of viewers the
WTC final match
is going to attract, Disney Star said their index, which measures the buzz, affinity, recall and awareness around any upcoming event, is tracking significantly higher than all other test series that have been played over the last four years.
The assembling of context, contest and the competitors is something that promises to make the WTC final match an exciting battle where sponsors are betting for high viewership.
Sanjog Gupta, Head of sports – Disney Star, told ET Online that the context of the contest is one where both India and Australia will be engaged in a scheduled five-day battle to create history. Whoever wins the WTC final match will be the first ever team to win all ICC trophies.
Moreover, the India-Australia fight is one of the most revered rivalries for any Indian fan, right from the time when Steve Waugh called India his final frontier to multiple engaging contests which went down to the wire and to India's domination over Australia in winning four of the last five series played between the two teams.

""This rivalry or this contest is one of the most anticipated contests in world cricket,"" he said.
Gupta said the competitors in the match also make it a match to watch out for and expected to garner a lot of interest. Two of the best batters in the world in Steve Smith and
Virat
Kohli are in action and the fierce Aussie fast bowling lineup will go up against the Indian openers in conditions which are supposed to be the truest test of a batsman's capabilities.
The Oval is hosting a game in June for the first time in 140 years, which means that both teams are going to face conditions that they've never faced before, even while they were touring England. ""So it's just been set up to be this epic moment or an event which has obviously got most Indian fans excited about it,"" Gupta said.
New kids to conglomerates, all board the bus
There have been whispers about how the sponsorship game is taking a turn particularly after media rights have been split between linear and connected TVs or OTT platforms.

If there was a myth that linear TV dying when it comes to live sport, then that myth has been busted wide open: Sanjog Gupta
However, the list of advertisers doesn't show any form of bias this time around, as companies, be it startups or legacies and from across domains, have partnered on both broadcast and streaming platforms.
Star Sports’ sponsors include Bajaj Allianz, LAYER'R SHOT, Pokerbaazi,
MRF
, Samco Securities, Jindal Panther Steel,
Ultratech Cement
, DBS Bank, Atomberg Technologies,
Maruti Suzuki
, Charged By Thums Up,
Hero Motocorp
, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Livguard Energy Technologies, Allied Blenders and Distilleries. In addition to the 15 sponsors, Star Sports has also onboarded 40 advertisers and over 45+ brands.
Baazi Games has joined as the co-presenting sponsor and ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund is the co-power sponsor on Disney+ Hotstar. Bajaj Allianz, Scaler,
Policy Bazaar
, Paisa Bazaar, Club Mahindra, Coca Cola, HSBC, Maruti Suzuki, Uber, L’Oreal and
Castrol
have been signed as associate sponsors.
""Typically what we see now is that a new-age company will allot a higher share of ad spend on digital platforms, while companies from FMCG or auto sectors would like to spend more on linear TV. However, it is very advantageous for a brand when they can bundle it on both TV and digital as that ensures reaching out to all types of customers. A Disney Star deal, when they are broadcasting the matches on both platforms, offers that choice,"" said Karan Taurani, senior vice president - research analyst (media, consumer discretionary & internet) at Elara Capital.
Riding the IPL boat into WTC
India is unlikely to have a fatigue impact from overdose of cricket, after months of domestic T20 frenzy, as it is a country where millions believe this sport is a religion for them. Rather, the IPL too has helped carry momentum into the 5-day test match.
Disney Star, which had the TV broadcast right for the over two-month IPL that concluded on May 29 amid massive fan euphoria, had started playing promotional and other videos around the WTC final.
There was a narrative built around to begin with what the squad for the WTC final will be and then what the preparations for the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara or for that matter Virat, the former being in England and the latter playing the IPL, would be like going into the WTC final.
""There is a lot of anticipation that has been built on the back of our coverage in the lead up to the WTC final, which was watched by millions of people as they were watching the IPL,"" Gupta said. ""Also, the WTC final is on Disney+ Hotstar and all Star Sports channels, which means that there is that much more synergy in the efforts to really elevate both the coverage as well as the campaign around the WTC final.""
The expectation is for the world test championship finals to be special when it comes to the aggregation of viewers that it will bring. Gupta said, bilateral cricket on Star has seen significant growth in viewership over the last six months.
The journey started with the Asia Cup, followed by the T20 World Cup and then continued into the bilaterals where Disney Star saw record-breaking viewing figures even for the test matches between India and Australia.
“So, we are hoping some of that momentum, which got carried into the IPL, will continue to carry on into the WTC final,” he said.
The WTC final also has a reserve day only if there is disruption due to weather.

Notwithstanding the over-the-top (OTT) onslaught, Pankaj is confident that the cable TV
business
will continue to grow and generate cash for the company.
He said there are 100 million non-television households that can be brought into the pay-tv ecosystem. He also sees
acquisition
opportunities for the company, as a large part of the cable TV industry is still unorganised.
Going forward, GTPL Hathway intends to converge cable TV, broadband, and OTT services under one umbrella, as the company's pipe can be used to deliver multiple services.
""We have to combine those businesses together, combine those offerings, make it more lucrative for the customer, and increase our services,"" he added.
In December 2022, GTPL Hathway launched an OTT aggregation service, GTPL Genie+, for its customers in partnership with over 15 streaming services.
Pankaj said the Genie+ service has onboarded 12,000 subscribers, including 8,000 from the broadband side and around 4,000 from the cable side.
He also asserted that the company has not seen any impact from
JioCinema
's free Indian
Premier
League (IPL) offering.
In FY23, GTPL Hathway's net profit dipped 43% to Rs 114.5 crore, while
revenue
increased 12% to Rs 2714 crore. The company has 8.95 million cable TV subscribers and 0.92 million broadband customers.

Why line for 'Succession' ended at Telegram,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/why-line-for-succession-ended-at-telegram/articleshow/100752361.cms,05-06-2023,"Last week, millions of viewers around the world came to terms with the end of HBO's widely acclaimed series,
Succession
.
A host of them from India also bid goodbye to
Telegram
, the messenger app that competes with WhatsApp and
Signal
.
How are the two events related, you ask?
Earlier this year, Disney+ Hotstar decided against renewing its programming deal with HBO, so when the fourth - and final - season of Succession began streaming worldwide on March 26, there was no legitimate streaming platform where the Indian audience could watch the latest episodes.
Many fans thus resorted to installing Telegram for the first time to access pirated episodes of the series through the app's user-led channels.

""My Twitter timeline was full of people asking where to watch Succession and most replies hinted at Telegram, so I downloaded the app as it seemed less complicated than looking up sites to download torrents,"" said a 38-year-old content writer from Mumbai, who prefers to stay anonymous for not wanting to publicise the fact that they watch pirated content.
""I did not do a single textual interaction on the app. Every Monday morning, I would ask a friend for the new episode on WhatsApp and they would send a link on Telegram,"" the content writer said. ""Once the season was over, I uninstalled the app because WhatsApp is enough for all my instant messaging needs.""
At 70.48 million downloads in 2022, India is Telegram's largest market, according to data reporting and analytics solutions provider Demand Sage.
SimilarWeb data accessed by ET show that Telegram registered 21.1 million user visits in April, the highest it has gotten in seven months since October 2022.
Links Available
Digital media professionals emphasised that this spike in traffic cannot be directly attributed to Succession, but that demand for the show could have been one of the many contributing factors.
A query sent to Telegram's official press bot on the app did not elicit a response till press time.
In May, JioCinema bought the rights to stream the show in India, along with other HBO titles. Indian viewers could catch the last three episodes of the final season on JioCinema as they aired. However, many still chose to take the Telegram route as it was free of cost, while the platform required them to buy a premium subscription to watch international content.
The
social media
chatter around Telegram in relation to watching Succession in India reinforces an open secret in the tech world: While Telegram markets itself as a fast and ""secure"" messaging app, it has instead gained the reputation of being a safe haven for sharing and consuming pirated content over the years.
""I downloaded the app in 2019 when I heard Game of Thrones' final season had started leaking there first,"" recalled a cloud data architect from Kolkata. ""I had totally forgotten about the app when I changed phones over the years, until earlier this year, when a friend asked for Succession's episodes. I remembered Telegram always has these shows first, or at least quicker and cleaner than many other platforms, so I reinstalled and uninstalled again after the final episode.""
While Succession may have been all the rage among the English-speaking streaming population, in April, links for Tamil movies like Rudhran, Pathu Thala and Ponniyin Selvan 1, were among the top breakout queries related to Telegram on Google, as per Google Trends for the country.
Privacy Feature
""The platform says it doesn't 'process any requests' regarding illegal content that appears in encrypted chats or private groups. This is meant to be a privacy feature, but it enables easy sharing of harmful or illegal content,"" said Rohini Lakshane, a technologist and interdisciplinary researcher.
In the past, Telegram has conducted content strikes to remove pornographic content and
copyright
violations from groups and broadcast channels. ""But it is easy for these groups and channels to come up again,"" said Lakshane. ""The social network-style sharing of links, private group and channel invites (for enormous groups and channels that may have hundreds or thousands of members) also keep the
distribution
going.""
Security concerns notwithstanding, active Telegram users find it useful as they can connect with people without sharing their number and, through a user handle, share large files (up to 2 GB) for free, as well as create large groups with 200,000 members and channels with unlimited subscribers.
In spite of this, ""most people see Telegram as a place where you get web series and movies for free,"" said Parikshit Shah, founder of digital marketing agency Eerlik Media. Shah, 29, who uses the platform's many channels to stay updated on political and financial news, finds this rather ""sad"" because he feels it clouds the more useful features that don't require users to operate in a grey area like piracy.

DTH
) industry has successfully countered subscriber churn by attracting new users, driven by the Indian
Premier
League (
IPL
) T20 cricket tournament, which started on March 31, top industry executives said. The final is to be held on Monday.
Gopal Vittal
, MD and CEO of
Bharti Airtel
, said the DTH business saw strong net additions in April and May. He also stated that the company's strategy of aggregating all video content with broadband has paid rich dividends for the company.
""Cricket, as you know, has an impact on DTH, and if you strip the cricket viewers out of the customer base, which we do now on a very scientific basis, this results in the core business looking strong or looking better,"" Vittal said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on May 17. He said Airtel expects this to play out in the quarter.
The industry has added an estimated 300,000 subscribers because of IPL, experts said.
""The industry has managed to arrest the decline in subscriber base in the last two months, primarily due to IPL,"" said the CEO of a DTH company who didn't want to be identified. ""The industry may have added 300,000 subscribers in the last two months. We have to wait to see if this momentum continues.""

Tariff Hike to Help
Others have made changes in strategy to arrest the decline.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL) MD and CEO Punit Goenka announced on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that the decline in DTH subscription revenue had been halted.
He said the collective decision to withdraw Hindi general entertainment channels from the government-owned DD Free Dish was aimed at preventing pay subscribers from migrating to that platform. This strategic move was implemented to safeguard the broadcaster's subscription base, he said.
""We have managed to arrest the decline in pay-TV revenues, particularly from DTH due to
FTA
(free-to-air) withdrawal,"" he said. ""However, the growth that we expected has yet to come in. We have to look at the decision from the medium to long term rather than from a one-year aspect.""
To be sure, according to the FICCI-EY 2023 report, TV subscription revenue declined for the third year in a row as the pay TV universe saw a decline of five million homes and consumer-end ARPUs (average revenue per user) remained stagnant.
Rating agency Crisil noted recently that the tariff hike undertaken by DTH operators following the implementation of the
Telecom Regulatory Authority
of India's (Trai's) New Tariff Order (
NTO
) 3.0 will lead to a 6-8% growth in their revenue to ₹19,500 crore in fiscal 2024, which is roughly 95% of the pre-pandemic revenue in fiscal 2020.

Indian Premier League
's official broadcaster Disney Star has garnered the highest viewership numbers in the tournament's history for the first 66 matches, according to data from Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India.
A total of 48.2 crore viewers tuned in to the live broadcast of TATA
IPL
2023 for the first 66 matches on the Disney Star Network, the highest ever reach for any edition of IPL surpassing the previous highest registered in 2019, the media giant said citing BARC data.
The network's television viewership ratings also spiked banking on the burgeoning popularity of the cash-rich cricket league that is scheduled to end on May 28. The on-year growth in weekly TVR stands at 43% for week 7. The overall TVR growth is 32% compared to the last edition after 66 games.
Last month, Disney Star said it had taken just 29 matches of this year’s edition of the cricket league to break the TV viewership record set in the whole of the 2022 edition. In 29 matches, the TV viewership hit over 40 crore, while it recorded a growth of nearly 24% in TVR in comparison to the last edition, according to BARC data.
This comes at a time when Disney Star is locked in a tussle this year with Viacom18 that won digital rights for the world's second-richest league. The strategies were crucial to ramp up viewership on TV and on its network, which they call the 'home of sports'.

In fact, it is also not certain if the BCCI will sell the rights for four years (from 2023 to 2027) or for a different tenure, the source added.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
is reportedly in talks with creditors to repay debts and clear the last hurdle to complete merger with Sony Pictures Networks India, which will give India a $10 billion media giant. Sony Corp. Chairman and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida recently said the anticipated merger between Sony and Zee is expected to be completed by the first half of the current fiscal year ending March 31.
BCCI did not respond to the queries.
Sony used to broadcast IPL on its channel from the first edition till 2017, when Star India (now Disney Star) picked up the rights. Sony Sports Network also holds the rights to broadcast games from England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Disney Star holds the rights to broadcast and stream matches on TV and on its digital platform for all ICC events. It also has the rights for the Asia Cup till this year.
In 2018,
Star Sports
India had outbid
Reliance
and Sony to win the
BCCI media rights
, for both television and digital platforms, for Rs 6138.1 crore. The rights were for the period of 2018 to 2023.
The BCCI will want to issue the tender before the Asia Cup scheduled this year, but it will want to ensure that the
Zee Sony merger
has come through before it tenders the rights, a source said.
The 2023 Asia Cup will be hosted by Pakistan and it is scheduled in September.
Another key hurdle at the moment is how BCCI will package the rights, a source said, given that the board may want to reap maximum value following the split distribution of five-year rights for IPL between Reliance and Disney Star who paid a cumulative Rs 48,390 crore at electronic auction to pick the digital and TV rights.
ET had reported earlier that BCCI will unbundle television broadcasting and digital rights for India’s future bilateral series. Some industry experts had said the property will be valued in excess of Rs 15,000 crore, or nearly $2 billion, for the next four- or five-year bloc.
However, a source told ET Online that the mix of the formats (Tests, ODIs & T20Is) in the future fixture will determine the valuation.
BCCI is also said to be still working on if they will opt for e-auction or other modes. BCCI may also separate the rights of men's and women's rights following the launch of Women's
Premier
League that saw some commercial value.
According to media reports, some industry experts are of the view that the BCCI is not sure about reaping high amounts from selling the bilateral rights as broadcasters in the past have not been able to recover the full amount they invested for each match.
As per the ICC’s Future Tours Programme (FTP), the Indian men’s cricket team is slated to play 38 Tests, 42 one-day internationals, and 61 T20 internationals between 2023 and 2027.

About the broadcast business, Gada said TV still has a lot of headroom to grow since there is a large population that lives in TV-dark areas. He said
Prasar Bharati
's free direct-to-home (DTH) platform, DD Free Dish, has the potential to bring new audiences to the TV universe. “DD Free Dish will become an entry point for consumers in TV-dark areas,” he said. “Over a period of time, these consumers will gravitate towards the pay-TV space.""
Digital
, he said, will continue to post strong growth on a higher base. “For us, scalability and the right to win are two key criteria when it comes to expanding the OTT business,” he said.
Gada said OTT will see a similar growth trajectory as TV, where media companies started catering to regional audiences once Hindi audiences were fully addressed.
“Our top line is back to the scale where we were. We reported a profit despite a ?55-cr investment last year,” Shemaroo’s CEO said.

On Thursday, the

""This work reflects long term efforts that will enable even more advances and better use of this technology across everything we do,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said.
The custom accelerator chip will help speed up the recommendation algorithm that powers what people see on Facebook and Instagram. A new data center design is being rolled out specifically for hardware that's best for AI. Meta said it has also finished the second phase of building its AI supercomputer to train large language models, which are technologies similar to those that power ChatGPT.

Connected TV ecosystem gets big boost from free IPL streaming,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/connected-tv-ecosystem-gets-big-boost-from-free-ipl-streaming/articleshow/100333617.cms,18-05-2023,"Viacom18’s decision to offer
Indian Premier League
(
IPL
) streaming free of cost has fuelled the consumption and penetration of
connected TV
(CTV), experts say.
""We are seeing an uptick in the reach of connected TVs this year. At the end of five weeks, CTVs will have over twice the reach of HDTVs. We also made IPL streaming free for all network subscribers this year. The removal of a paywall extended our reach,"" Viacom18 Sports CEO Anil Jayaraj told ET.
Madison World Chairman Sam Balsara said CTV is a great proposition because it gives marketers the brand-building capabilities of television along with the sharper targeting of digital.
""For IPL, CTV was sold based on total coverage; it at least gave you the option of reaching out to a limited audience, arguably with much greater purchasing power. This is a new and important development in this year’s IPL. Until last year, the CTV numbers were very small, but now we have reasonably good numbers for CTV,"" he said.
Affle-owned Mediasmart’s VP India, SEA, and Middle East, Nikhil Kumar, said CTV has gotten a boost from free streaming of the IPL given the fact that cricket is akin to a religion in India and the IPL is one of the most watched sports events in the country.

""It is expected that the streaming of IPL via CTV and OTT platforms like Jio Cinema will lead to a further surge in CTV adoption. The emergence of a new segment of viewers who are tuning in to IPL on Jio Cinemas via their CTVs is likely to be a driving force behind this growth,"" he added.
In a recent interaction with ET, Finecast Global CEO Nicola Lewis said that WPP's specialised media arm is bullish about CTV's growth in India. ""The total number of CTV households is expected to grow from 25 million this year to 45 million by 2025,"" she stated.
Nicola also said 28% of new clients that came into the Finecast ecosystem globally came from India. Finecast, which launched in India last year, helps advertisers capitalise on the popularity of broadcast content across TV and digital landscapes.
Jayaraj said over 40 advertisers across categories like international brands, financial services, e-commerce, and autos are advertising exclusively on CTV.
""From 78 spots (average ad spots per match) in week one, it has reached 94 spots (per match) in week four, which represents a 20 percent growth,"" he stated. JioCinema has priced its CTV ad spots at Rs 6.5 lakh per 10 seconds for the IPL.
Mediasmart’s Kumar said the IPL has the potential to attract new advertisers to the CTV universe, as many advertisers today are already digitally native.
""We are seeing that shorter ads between overs continue to be the norm, with 6-second and 15-second shutter ads ruling the dynamics of advertising on CTV IPL. This is in line with the fact that CTV advertising on live TV gives limited scope to longer ads,"" he noted.

""The Board of Directors of
New Delhi Television
Limited (""the Company""), at its meeting held today, i.e., May 17, 2023, has approved a proposal to seek the permission of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for the launch of nine (9) news channels in different Indian languages in phases,"" NDTV said in the regulatory filing.
The company added that it will inform the stock exchanges of the launch date of the said channels upon receipt of approval from the MIB.
After taking control of NDTV, Adani Group-owned AMG Media Networks' CEO
Sanjay Pugalia
stated that the company would strengthen and invest in the NDTV newsroom to be a multi-faceted multi-media digital platform.
In December 2022, the Adani Group completed the acquisition of a 27.26% stake in NDTV from promoters Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy for Rs 602.2 crore at Rs 342.65 per share.
It owns a 64.71% stake in the TV news company.
Adani Group's entry into NDTV began with the acquisition of a 99.5% stake in RRPR Holding Private Limited (RRPR) by Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Media Networks. The RRPR acquisition gave Adani Group a 29.18% stake in the TV news company.
The acquisition triggered an open offer, with VCPL acquiring an additional 8.27% to take its total shareholding to 37.45%.
According to the FICCI-EY report, news channels comprised 44% of the total channels in India. The report further stated that the news genre garnered 27% of the total ad volumes, which puts it in second place after the general entertainment genre.
In 2022, the report noted that the news channels produced over 36,000 hours of nonnews bulletins like news-linked content, documentaries, or specials.
The Pitch-Madison Advertising Report pegs the TV news ad market size at Rs 2500–3000 crore. The TV news market is highly fragmented with the presence of a long list of channels across languages.

Sports tech: The impact player that teleports humans and gets you hooked to IPL mania on devices,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/sports-tech-the-impact-player-that-teleports-humans-and-gets-you-hooked-to-ipl-mania-on-devices/articleshow/100204390.cms,14-05-2023,"Kids in Indian homes back in the 80s or even early 90s would typically risk a fall from a precarious position on the roof to align the television antenna and secure a glitch-free feed of a sporting event. Those kids, now grown up women or men, can either carry the games in their pockets or view it on giant screens at a pub in the best resolution available today, while the audio is powered by Dolby Atmos.
The evolution in watching sports on any device has happened thanks to broadcasters enabling technology to be a big player in every game. In fact, the love affair of tech and sports in India has deep rooted connection even in the revolution of TVs going from black and white to colour. India was introduced to colour TVs primarily to showcase the 1982 Asian Games.
As for cricket, the most followed sport in India, it has evolved from red ball and green tops to today's magnanimous craze for the $11 billion worth
Indian Premier League
. Alongside what has grown is a cartoon of a sobbing duck when a batter scored a zero to today's features ranging from a hologram technology placing commentators in studios to engrossing fans during live matches.
While the list of ever-evolving tech innovation is already too long, Sanjog Gupta, Head of Sports – Disney Star, said we have just started scratching the surface with regard to the innovations.
Of the fans, by the fans, for the fans
Live Events
""Watching cricket now is like witnessing the evolution of species. The game has transformed from a leisurely-paced pastime to a high-octane spectacle, with new formats, rules, and technologies bringing a whole new dimension to the sport,"" said Hitesh Rajpurohit, a cricket addict and Co-Founder and CEO of Cutting Fillum Entertainment.
Rajpurohit said he vividly recalls how much fun it was to watch cricket on TV with his family and friends as a kid. ""To fix the antenna and get the signal of the station that broadcasts the game in my hamlet was a major accomplishment,"" he said. Today, times have changed and so has viewing cricket. The luxury of watching cricket on a phone, whenever and wherever, or community viewing via large TV screens at public places, is equally thrilling.
Technology now has enabled viewing the game in a manner which is like having your own personal cricket channel, he said.
The demand of or by the fans for constant evolution is perhaps what has driven broadcasters to adopt advanced technology for the fans, among other factors.
Sanjog Gupta said as far as coverage of sports is concerned for Disney Star, there are three driving factors for innovations - a focus on deepening the engagement of fans, understanding fan behaviour to customise offerings, and the constant push for improved efficiency of internal processes, workflows and the production back-end.
The wagon wheel of tech for watching
IPL
2023
Watching the highlights of the first match of the cash-rich tournament and a game today of what has grown to be the world's second richest league will clearly reflect the tech play that has been brought in.
JioCinema, the official streaming partner of IPL, lets fans select camera angles, commentary language, live stats in the app, fan interactions and quizzes among other features. Termed as hype mode, it also allows fans during live matches to rewind an action, see all necessary stats of the match or the tournament points table, play the best angles for key highlights and even set the speed for playback. Mukesh Ambani's flagship OTT platform JioCinema is streaming IPL in 4k resolution and also enables Dolby Atmos audio feature.

Along with the multi-cam setup with Hype feature, JioCinema is offering 16 unique feeds, including an Insiders feed, Hangout feed, Fan feed, and Fantasy feed. One can even switch to watching the game with a 360 degree vision to showcase what the game looks like from the participating teams' dugouts.

Meanwhile, Disney Star, the official broadcaster of IPL, too has roped in Dolby to offer Atmos sound feature while they also offer an ambience only mode. The network along with Dolby has placed more than 40 microphones in each stadium to capture the best sound and offer an immersive experience.
While TVs are no more the so-called stupid boxes, the legacy company has added interactive features in TV itself where fans can watch real-time match highlights, select from a host of regional language commentaries, fix camera on their favourite stars, access stats feed and even let fans switch on subtitles, which is key during community viewing in a public place either amid hullabaloo or roar of the fans.
Disney Star has launched Pro and VIP features for Tata and Airtel's set-top boxes that offers mutiple features from match highlights to stats
Disney Star also has a meta fan interaction feature. In this, powered by 5G, fans could interact with their favorite cricketer from any remote location over the internet with their Meta-Avatar projected in Disney Star's studios. It is also using the Metaverse, which the company described as the next-gen interactive platform for all sports lovers to watch live events – matches, live concerts – with friends and family.

IPL has also invested in augmented reality for fans to get interactive experiences in the form of virtual games. Tech has come far. A VR immersive cricket game feature of Disney Star also delivers mixed reality output, broadcast-like output, and stabilized POV output for advanced analysis of the game.
BTS and the merging illusion with reality
The tech for sports broadcasting has reached a high where commentators or experts are teleported to studios from overseas lands. The studio with its green screen and the vfx then creates a background typically of a glass window overlooking a city or the ground where the game is played.
The hologram technology is near perfect and Twitter was set ablaze when IPL started this year as netizens spoke how they could not figure out Steve Smith was not in the studio of Disney Star during a match.

Don't be surprised if you find out that not even all commentators commenting in the popular English or Hindi language are seated in the studios and teleported to look like they are seated at the venue.
To make the illusion look real, Disney Star has multiple images from across stadiums. The broadcaster also uses spider-cam, the ones used in the ground, for various shows and a tour to the studio too can give you the vibe of the press box at a stadium.
While many of these innovations are born to cater to demands of fans, they are also proponents of optimal resource utilisation.
Disney Star, for example, said the laurels are to be given to broadband connectivity that they have enabled in various stadiums around the country to produce customised coverage of specific feeds for specific regions in the languages of choice, as well as talent of choice.
""So, if we have to produce fully customised feeds for Tamil Nadu or Karnataka, we cannot keep building commentary boxes at the venue because the real estate at the venue is limited and thus the remote production model, which is something that we have been pioneers in starting in 2015, has played a significant role in enabling the creation of this,"" Gupta said.
The remote production model has now become the norm for any marquee cricket event to have multiple feeds catering to different regions across the country.
New kids to legends, adding tech catalyst
To decide on what tech needs to be implemented, Gupta said Disney Star looks at three filters - the insight and the consumer strategy, the scale of deployment and impact possible, and ROI.
However, there are the new kids of the industries, or startups, engaged along with the established players to add the vital tech element in broadcasting the games. The broadcasters too may have their own research and development teams.
Disney Star partners with global tech services providers who already have a ready-made product that can be deployed on broadcast, which is the case with Hawk-Eye. Their second model involves an in-house development model and this is where they have spent significant efforts to even build what they call a Star Lab. They also work with startups like Ink In Caps, who is onboarded as part of the Star Lab collaboration to develop specific solutions. The broadcaster also partners with global tech providers who may have solutions which can be customised and also built further to develop proprietary tools for deployment.
Disney Star has a partnership with Epic Games, which is one of the world's largest gaming software and engine providers, to develop real-time 3D graphics.
The return on investment is however crucial for the sports broadcasters.
""At the end of the day, there is a certain budget that we work with. We have to make sure that the choices we make are genuinely delivering to the objectives we have, but they can also deliver within the budget we have, and have an ROI in terms of the impact that these solutions will have, which validates the choice to make that investment,"" Gupta said.
Gupta said the journey of tech innovation is one that does not have a destination. It is uncertain if there is a finish line to innovations in bringing the sports live for fans on their TVs, digital devices or any medium that may be invented in future.
Nonetheless, the game must be enjoyed to the fullest and every moment must be cherished, for you may not watch MS Dhoni live in action again after this IPL, unless an AI comes cloned or disguised in his avatar on the ground. But, won't that be too plastic?

No more freebies: Ambani's JioCinema to now charge premium subscription for HBO and other content,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/no-more-freebies-ambanis-jiocinema-to-now-charge-premium-subscription-for-hbo-and-other-content/articleshow/100203953.cms,13-05-2023,"India's billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani's flagship OTT platform
JioCinema
has rolled out a Premium subscription service, moving away from offering all content for free in the app.
JioCinema will be charging Rs 999 for a year for the Premium subscription that will let users stream content from studios like HBO and
Warner
Bros.
""We believe the pricing is at the lower end of premium OTT platforms' annual pricing - Hotstar, Amazon, Netflix whose pricing is in the range of Rs 1000-2000 for an annual plan. However, we don’t see a large scale paid subsriber base due to this, as Indian audience is value driven and may not pay this much only for price HBO/Warner Bros content,"" said Karan Taurani, Senior Vice President & research analyst at Elara Capital.
ET Online had reported in April that Reliance-owned JioCinema may likely start charging you for its content after the end of the Indian
Premier
League, even as the official digital streaming partner of the world's richest cricket league continues to offer free streaming of IPL that is breaking several viewership records this year.

OTT share in total movie collection improves in 2022
IPL streaming this year continues to remain free and so does some Bollywood movies including recently added Vikram Vedha.
In late April, Viacom18 had inked a multi-year, multi-million dollar content deal with Warner Bros Discovery, allowing JioCinema to stream HBO, Max Original, and Warner Bros' content in India.
The launch of the subscription model also juxtaposes with the record digital viewership that JioCinema has garnered for IPL, while it had also offered FIFA World Cup last year for free.
In an interview to Bloomberg, Reliance's media and content business President
Jyoti
Deshpande had in April said Viacom18's JioCinema plans to bulk up on content with more than 100 films and TV series to its platform.

Ambani is thus building on the popularity of IPL to push content and finally introduce the pricing strategy for a nation home to 1.4 billion people who are crazy about cricket as well as movies. He also seeks to become a global media and online streaming behemoth, taking on the global giants.
IPL being offered free is actually to gain traction from the masses for JioCinema, but an ad free SVOD model with HBO/Warner Bros content will also help target the premium households, said Taurani.
Experts had opined that Asia’s richest tycoon Ambani's OTT platform streaming the IPL this time wasn't aiming to win all viewers. He is keen to plant a dominant position for consumer super-apps while his flagship telecom company attracts customers from Sunil Mittal's
Bharti Airtel
and financially strained Vodafone Idea.
Ambani is also seen close to listing Jio Platforms on the stock indices.
Under the subscription model, JioCinema will stream shows including Game of Thrones, The Last of Us, House of the Dragon, Fatal Attraction and more. The subscription also will allow viewers to watch movies such as the Harry Potter movie series, Wonder Woman and Batman vs Superman, among others.
The plan will be valid for 12 months and users can watch on any device and up to four devices simultaneously.

Zee Media in race to buy FM radio broadcaster RBNL,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-media-in-race-to-buy-fm-radio-broadcaster-rbnl/articleshow/100139219.cms,10-05-2023,"Zee Media Corporation
Limited (ZMCL) has got board approval to bid for
Reliance
Broadcast Network Limited (
RBNL
), a company that has been put under the corporate insolvency process by the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
).
""The Board of Directors of the Company, vide Resolution passed by circulation on May 5, 2023, have granted the approval to the Company to submit Expression of Interest (‘EOI') with Corporate Insolvency Resolution Professional (‘CIRP’) of Reliance Broadcast Network Limited (‘RBNL’) in relation to the ""Invitation for Expression of Interest for Submission of Resolution Plan for Reliance Broadcast Network Limited"" issued by CIRP appointed in terms of the extant provisions for Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of RBNL,"" Zee Media said in a regulatory filing.
Resolution Professional Rohit Mehra, on behalf of RBNL, has issued an ad seeking expressions of interest from interested entities. The last date for the receipt of the expression of interest is May 14.
The date of issue of the provisional list of prospective resolution applicants is May 24. The last date for the submission of objections to the provisional list is May 29.
RBNL is in the business of
FM radio
broadcasting. It operates radio stations under the Big FM brand in 58 Indian cities.
Live Events
As per the audited financials, the company recorded revenues of Rs 174 crore FY22-23. It has 553 employees, including 441 permanent employees.
On February 24, the NCLT admitted RBNL under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). The Mumbai bench of the NCLT had also appointed Rohit Ramesh Mehra as an insolvency resolution professional.
The NCLT order came on a petition filed by
IDBI
Trusteeship Services Ltd, which had approached the tribunal after the company allegedly failed to repay its dues of over Rs 174 crore.
""We are of the considered view that since the registered office of the corporate debtor (Reliance Broadcast) is in Mumbai, this tribunal has territorial jurisdiction over the present subject matter by virtue of Section 60(1) of the Code,"" observed the bench led by judicial member Kuldip Kumar Kareer and a technical member Anuradha Sanjay Bhatia in its order of February 24.
In 2018, Zee Media called off its deal with RBNL for the purchase of the latter's FM radio business for an enterprise valuation of Rs 1592 crore due to a delay in getting regulatory approvals.
In November 2016, the Essel Group-promoted news network signed a definitive agreement with RBNL to acquire a 49% stake in RBNL's FM radio business, with an option to acquire the balance (51% stake) after the three-year lock-in period.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
Limited (ZEEL) bought the TV broadcasting business of RBNL for a price consideration of Rs 298.4 crore.

Jaishankar referred to Rahul Gandhi's meeting with the Chinese ambassador to India during the Doklam crisis. He attacked the government, suggesting that new territory had been lost to China's salami slicing.
""I know everything in politics is political. I accept that. But I think on certain issues, we have a collective responsibility to at least behave in a way that we do not weaken our (India's) collective position abroad to do what we have seen in the last three years in China,"" Jaishankar said, adding, ""often very misleading narratives are put in.""
Jaishankar also hit out at misleading narratives and misrepresentations, adding, ""We had, for example...a bridge which the Chinese were building on Pangong Tso. Now, the reality was that the particular area first Chinese came in 1959, and then they occupied it in 1962. But that's not the way it was put across. This happened in the case of some of the so-called model villages as well, that they were built on areas which we lost in 62 or before 62. Now, I don't believe you will very rarely hear me say 1962, that shouldn't have happened, or you are wrong, or you are responsible. What has happened has happened. It's our collective, I would say failure or responsibility. I do not necessarily attribute political colouring to it. I would like to see is actually a serious China conversation. I'm prepared to accept that there are different viewpoints on that, but if you reduce it to kind of slanging match, what can I say after that?""

"It's Akashvani now, Prasar Bharati drops references to AIR",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/its-akashvani-now-prasar-bharati-drops-references-to-air/articleshow/99987990.cms,04-05-2023,"Public broadcaster Prasar Bharti has decided to drop references to its
radio
service as 'All India Radio' and substitute it with 'Akashvani', as mentioned in the law. An internal order issued by
Akashvani
Director General Vasudha Gupta on Wednesday seeks ""compliance with immediate effect"" to the statutory provision which had replaced the name of
AIR
(
All India Radio
) to Akashvani.
""This is a very old decision of the government which was not operationalised earlier. We are now operationalising it,"" Gaurav Dwivedi, Chief Executive Officer,
Prasar Bharati
said.
The Prasar Bharati (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990, mentions that 'Akashvani' means the offices, stations and other establishments, by whatever name called, which, immediately before the appointed day, formed part of or were under the Director-General, All India Radio of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
The Prasar Bharati Act came into force on November 15, 1997.
""The aforesaid statutory provision which has replaced the name AIR to the 'Akashvani' may be brought to the notice of all so that names and titles get in tune with the provisions of the Prasar Bharati Act of 1990 passed by the Parliament,"" the internal order said.
Live Events
All India Radio was referred to as 'Akashvani' by renowned poet Rabindranath Tagore in a poem he had written for the inauguration of the Calcutta shortwave service in 1939.
The Prasar Bharati website states that a private radio station named Akashvani Mysore was set up on September 10, 1935.
Akashvani's home service comprises 470 broadcasting centres located across the country and broadcasts in 23 languages and 179 dialects, covering 92 per cent of the country's area and 99.19 per cent of the total population.

IPL viewership spike may draw in more advertisers, say experts
The broadcaster said its offering of value packs, where sports content is also curated with other popular channels, was taken up by people as it provides a complete wholesome entertainment for the entire family.
""Not only that, we were mindful that you would have a new set of customers coming in, so we needed to ensure that we engage with them in a very meaningful and innovative manner,"" Kapoor said.
The broadcaster also launched interactive features on TV sets, allowing viewers to watch match highlights at any time, fix cameras on their favorite stars or get real-time subtitles of commentary at the click of a button.
Disney Star also broadcast some IPL clashes on their free-to-air channel Star Utsav Movies, an “innovative” strategy which the company said attracted new customers.

Just 29 matches in, DisneyStar breaks viewership record set in entire IPL 2022
""There is an audience on Free Dish who did not get to view IPL in the past and this strategy was to give an opportunity for the viewers on Free Dish to sample IPL. BARC estimates the Free Dish viewers to be about 42 million. We built a narrative and a campaign where we encouraged people to move from Free to Pay TV by just paying Rs 19 for Star Sports 1; and this really worked for us,"" Kapoor said.
Last week, Disney Star said it has taken just 29 matches of this year’s edition of the cricket league to break the TV viewership record set in the whole of the 2022 edition. In 29 matches, the TV viewership hit over 40 crore, while it recorded a growth of nearly 24% in television viewership ratings (TVR) in comparison to the last edition, according to BARC data.
However, this comes at a time when Disney Star is in a viewership battle with a digital platform streaming the matches for free.
IPL rivalries on the ground have been a talking point for ages and
Virat
Kohli recently got into a heated argument with his former Indian teammate Gambhir, showcasing the intense nature of the tournament where cricketers are auctioned and they play for franchises representing different Indian cities.
“It is commendable that despite having free digital access, TV remains a popular and competitive medium for sports,” said Utkarsh Sinha, managing director at tech and media advisory firm Bexley Advisors. “Star's record viewership numbers for IPL so far are a strong indicator both of the popularity of IPL and the preference many consumers still have for televisions as a medium for consuming sports content, where the community viewership aspect is meaningful.”
The Board of Control for Cricket in India had set up a rivalry outside the ground starting this IPL between Disney Star and Mukesh Ambani's flagship OTT platform JioCinema after it split the TV and digital rights of IPL from 2023-2027 to eventually garner a whopping Rs 48,390 crore in total.
Disney Star bagged the TV rights for Rs 23,575 crore and Reliance-backed Viacom18 got digital rights for Rs 23,758 crore.
In comparison, Sony had acquired rights by paying Rs 8,200 crore for the first 10 editions of IPL till 2017, and Star had won the rights for the next five years with a bid of Rs 16,347.50 crore.
While the cost of rights surged, Disney Star's master playbook this year also had to take care of pricing amid inflationary times. Disney Star retained the Rs 19 per month fee for Star Sports 1 HD or SD services. Ambani's JioCinema offered streaming for free on digital platforms, which however burns mobile Internet data.
Offering content on HD mode also costs more for the broadcaster, but Disney Star matched the prices with SD to ensure a larger customer base. Disney Star has 77 channels and out of these, close to 40% of channels are in HD.
""We are aware that essentials are becoming expensive for the consumers at large and in this kind of a scenario, we need to be careful with our pricing strategy. Just to quote you an example, in the HSM market, we have taken price increases on packages not more than 10% and that 10% is after a period of four years,"" Kapoor said.
The official said people prefer to watch sports in HD. The company logged a reach of 66 million on HD channel for the first 29 games of IPL, according to BARC data, which is three times the reach from the previous edition.
India has been seeing a spike in demand for regional content as
South Indian
movies keep beating the otherwise dominant Bollywood movies. Now, local language commentary for cricket is certainly what viewers are going for as well.
Star Sports launched new HD South Indian language channels for broadcasting IPL and also played up the region-specific themes. It roped in a vast range of in-house experts like Gundappa Vishwanath, MSK Prasad, K Srikkanth, L Balaji, S Badrinath, Murali Vijay and S Sreesanth among others bringing fans closer to the game.
“This has been a big game changer since fans love watching sports in the language they understand and relate to…This has been a big growth vector for us and we have seen good consumer traction in markets like West Bengal, AP/ Telangana, Maharashtra and Gujarat,” Kapoor said.

Indian M&E sector crossed Rs 2 trillion revenue mark in 2022: FICCI EY report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/indian-me-sector-crossed-rs-2-trillion-revenue-mark-in-2022-ficci-ey-report/articleshow/99959155.cms,03-05-2023,"The Indian Media and Entertainment (M&E) sector grew 20% in 2022 to reach INR2.1 trillion (US$26.2 billion), 10% above its pre-pandemic levels in 2019, according to the FICCI-EY report ‘Windows of opportunity - India’s media & entertainment sector maximizing across segments’ launched today at the FICCI FRAMES 2023 in Powai.
The report added that the M&E sector will grow at a CAGR of 10.5% to reach INR2.8 trillion in 2025.
Digital media has grown significantly, reaching INR571 billion and increasing its contribution to the M&E sector from 16% in 2019 to an astonishing 27% in 2022. It is important to note that the digital segment's share of the entire M&E sector would rise to 50% if data costs were also to be factored in.
Ashish Pherwani, EY India Media & Entertainment Leader, stated, “The Indian M&E consumer base is large but heterogenous, hungry for content but willing to pay only for value, and more than ready to experiment with technology, be it streaming, digital payments, online education, virtual experiences, e-commerce,
social media
, or gaming. The diverse consumer base, coupled with favourable macroeconomic and demographic factors, have translated into a very exciting time for the sector.”
Jyoti
Deshpande, Co-Chairman, FICCI Media and Entertainment Committee, said “It’s an exciting time to be in the M&E business, as we
leverage
the three pillars of the industry - content, commerce, and community, fuelled by technological innovation. The sector is expected to grow 11.5% in 2023 to reach INR 2.34 trillion and further grow at a CAGR of 10.5% to reach INR 2.83 trillion by 2025. Through democratisation of the creator economy and disruption in digital distribution, I dream of an India with infinite storytellers finding infinite platforms to share their stories, engaging with audiences in every language, with India leading the charge across the global entertainment landscape.”
Live Events
Filmed entertainment, live events and Out-of-home media segments together contributed 40% of the M&E sector’s total growth in 2022.
At INR1,049 billion,
advertising
exceeded the INR1 trillion
benchmark
for the first time. In 2022, when India’s nominal GDP grew 15%, advertising recovered 19%. It is now 0.4% of India’s GDP, much lower than developed large markets like the US, Japan, and China, which are all between 0.6% and 1%.
There were over 125 deals in 2022 compared to 118 in 2021, of which 65% were in digital, gaming, and new media segments.
The key contributors to this growth will be digital, online gaming and television (together contributing to 65% of the growth), followed by animation and VFX (11%), live events (8%) and films (8%)
Segmental performance in 2022
Television – Television advertising grew 2% to end 2022 just behind its 2019 levels, on the back of volume growth. Subscription
revenue
continued to fall for the third year in a row, experiencing a 4% de-growth due to a reduction of five million pay TV homes and stagnant consumer-end ARPUs. While linear viewership declined 7% over 2021, 8 to 10 million smart TVs connected to the internet each day, up from around 5 million in 2021.
Digital advertising – Digital advertising grew 30% to reach INR499 billion, or 48% of total advertising revenues. Included in this is advertising by SME and long-tail advertisers of INR180 billion and advertising earned by e-commerce platforms of INR70 billion.
Digital subscription – Digital subscription grew 27% to reach INR72 billion. 99 million paid video subscriptions across almost 45 million Indian households generated INR68 billion. Due to a plethora of free audio options, just 4 to 5 million consumers bought music subscriptions, generating INR2.2 billion while online news subscriptions generated INR1.2 billion.
Print – Advertising revenues grew 13% in 2022 as print remained a “go-to” medium for more affluent and non-metro audiences. Subscription revenues grew 5% on the back of rising cover prices and has stabilized at 15% to 20% below the pre-COVID-19 levels. Digital revenues remain elusive for most newspaper companies.
Film – The segment grew 85% to reach 90% of its 2019 levels as theatres re-opened. Over 1,600 films were released in 2022, theatrical revenues crossed INR100 billion, and fewer films released directly on digital platforms. 335 Indian films were released overseas.
Online gaming – New players, marketing efforts, specialized platforms and brand ambassadors all worked to grow the segment 34% in 2022 to reach INR135 billion. Regulatory clarity improved, and this could lead to more FDI in this segment. There were over 400 million online gamers in India, of which around 90- 100 million played frequently. Real money gaming comprised 77% of segment revenues.
Animation and VFX – As content production resumed, service demand – both domestic and exports – increased, resulting in the segment growing 29% and crossing INR100 billion for the first time
Live events – The fastest growing segment of 2022, organized events grew 129% over a depleted base as weddings, corporate events and activations, government initiatives, and large marquee IP with international participation took place after a gap of almost two years.
OOH – OOH media grew 86% in 2022 and reached 94% of 2019 levels. Capacity utilization improved in 2022, but rates remained challenged. Digital OOH screens increased to around 100,000 and contributed 8% of total segment revenues.
Music – The segment grew by 19% to reach INR22 billion. Film music, which had reduced during the pandemic, returned at scale. 87% of revenues were earned through digital means, though most of it was advertising led, there being around only 4 to 5 million paying subscribers despite streaming reach of over 200 million.
Radio – Radio segment revenues grew 29% in 2022 to INR21 billion but were still just 66% of 2019 revenues. Ad volumes increased by 25% in 2022 as compared to the previous year, though ad rates remained 20% below their 2019 levels. Many radio companies are looking at alternate revenue streams to grow faster.

Vadodara, Kurnool, and Bardhaman witnessed defending champions Gujarat Titans beating Kolkata Knight Riders by seven wickets in the first game of the doubleheader on Saturday, while Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Delhi Capitals by nine runs in the second match.
Fans in Jalgaon, Varanasi, Karnal, and Thoothukudi saw Punjab Kings defeat four-time champions Chennai Super Kings in a thriller by four wickets in the first game on Sunday afternoon, followed by Mumbai Indians beating Rajasthan Royals by six wickets in the 1000th IPL game on Sunday evening.
IPL Fan Park, which is open to all cricket fans, had a wide variety of offerings for people of all ages, including a dedicated family zone, a kids zone, food and beverages, and the JioCinema Experience Zone.
Prime public spots across the seven cities were transformed into entertainment hubs with IPL Fan Parks set up for fans of the game.
Recently, JioCinema roped in Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma, who is also the captain of Mumbai Indians, as its brand ambassador.
In an earlier interaction with ET, Viacom18 Sports CEO Anil Jayaraj stated that the IPL live streaming on JioCinema has attracted new viewers from top metros, Tier 1 and Tier 3 towns, and rural India.
""This is a huge number of new viewers we have recorded, and they come from across top metros, tier 1 and 2 towns, and rural India, which alludes to the fact that the IPL is a real national phenomenon,"" Jayaraj said.
The company, which is offering the IPL free of cost to digital users, is hoping to attract 550 million viewers for the tournament, which kicked off on March 31.
JioCinema has set a new concurrency record for an Indian
Premier
League (IPL) match, with the Chennai Super Kings vs. Rajasthan Royals game clocking 24 million concurrent viewers.

"The timeless value of Sachin Tendulkar: Fandom, dreams & Rs 1,250 crores",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/the-timeless-value-of-sachin-tendulkar-fandom-dreams-rs-1250-crores/articleshow/99728572.cms,24-04-2023,"ANI
It is almost a decade since his retirement from international cricket, but Sachin as a brand remains durable even today
Do you remember watching a curly-haired short kid on live television with a 'Power' bat facing the mighty Pakistan pace trio of Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and backed by legendary leg-spinner Abdul Qadir?
Perhaps no.
Back in the winters of 1989, the broadcaster, Doordarshan, had opted to not telecast two matches in India as they covered the then ongoing Lok Sabha elections.
Thereafter, not only Indians but fans from other nations rued if they missed out on a chance to watch
Sachin Tendulkar
in action. They just couldn't miss watching the master blaster hit the straight drives, the stepping out from the crease to hit a sixer and raise a desert storm in Sharjah or even his quirky bowling that often won matches for India.
For more than two decades since 1989, the 16-year boy became the country's most-loved idol, or even a quasi-mythic God of the game if cricket is to be considered as a religion in today's most populous country.

The man turns 50 today, but the number looks miniscule in front of the runs he scored and for the 100 centuries-feat he achieved as the only cricketer to do so till now in international cricket.
Sachin Tendulkar, jersey number 10, over the years glued citizens to their televisions. Sachin on TV meant empty roads and clusters of people only in front of a TV shop, or loud voices of cheering or disappointments coming out of homes.
His fandom, kids' dreams of becoming another Sachin Tendulkar and the brand value still seem to be a giant sapling awaiting further growth. The unseen halo of Tendulkar is perhaps the brightest, emitting opportunities for brands that got associated with him. He is said to be a brand of a rare type of longevity, which marketed the dreams, hope and aspirations of generations.
It is almost a decade since his retirement from international cricket, but Sachin as a brand remains durable even today when even youngsters of late 2000s have either retired from the game or are about to hang their boots.
""While new icons like Kohli and Dhoni have unparalleled fandom, Sachin continues to be a unique part of people's psyche as the first hero they revered, at a time when India was just beginning its rise on the world stage. This makes him a brand which needs only a tiny stimulus or context to be activated,"" said Sanjog Gupta, Head of Sports – Disney Star.
Fandom & dreams of a billion
""There's an entire generation of cricket fans which grew up watching Sachin on TV. Feelings of pride and diverse emotions attached with those moments are imprinted on India's collective memory, which come rushing back each time stories of Sachin are told and re-told,"" said Gupta.
Sudhir Kumar Chaudhary, an Indian teacher and seen to be one of the biggest fans of the legend visits every match the Indian cricket team plays since 2003. Coming from Muzaffarpur, Bihar, Chaudhary had cycled for 21 days to Mumbai to watch Sachin play in a match. He paints his body with the tricolor of the Indian flag and embeds Tendulkar 10 on his back.
""As a 90s kid, no one has come close to being a godly figure in my life like Sachin Tendulkar. He brought out all emotions in me, be it joy or tears in my eyes,"" said Harendra Ray, a US stock market research analyst. ""Watching him on television whenever, wherever on TV or at the stadium are the best memories of my childhood and teenage years. My television used to be fixed on sports channels, watching him live or even the same highlights over and over.""
After India won the ICC World Cup for a second time in 2011, Sachin's teammates carried him on their shoulders. The man had carried the responsibility of winning cricket matches for India for years, and this was time India carried him on their shoulders.
Rare Diamond: Brand Value
Sachin also emerged to be one of the greatest sports stars for brands. He first featured in an advertisement for Band-aid and was the brand ambassador for the first time for Boost. He told Indian kids his secret - Boost is the secret of my energy.
What Sachin said in his often-mimicked voice was biblical to Indians. When police failed to control a crowd at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, even after a 'lathi-charge' as India was precariously close to losing in a match against Pakistan, it took a Sachin Tendulkar to walk around the ground and calm down the spectators.
""Sachin Tendulkar is still considered an icon and a beloved figure in India, so employing him in marketing campaigns can certainly be a great strategy for marketers who are targeting the Indian market, particularly if the product or service being promoted has a connection to sports or fitness,"" said Abhinav Pramod Pyati, Co-Founder and Business Head at Cutting Fillum Entertainment, a video and advertisement solutions consultancy agency.
Featuring Sachin in ads can help create a positive association between the product or service and the values that he represents, such as determination, excellence, and hard work. This can promote brand loyalty by enabling the brand to emotionally connect with people, Pyati added.
Sachin's brand longevity is such that
Star Sports
is celebrating his 50th birthday today with special programming around the legend's illustrious career. This is even at a time when the nation is gripped with the fever of the cash-rich Indian
Premier
League.
“Sachin is a legend much like Amitabh Bachchan from Bollywood. He has always been extracted in terms of endorsements. Even today he is featured in many endorsements because of what he is. There are people who may charge more, but he is irreplaceable,” said Karan Taurani, senior vice president and media analyst at Elara Capital.
India & Sachin's Breakout
India's economic liberalisation, initiated in 1991, unshackled the growth story for the Asian nation that has now become the world's fifth-largest economy. The breakout for India starting from multinational corporations setting up offices here to reforms in banks, taxes and opportunities for high-paid jobs coincided with the rise of Tendulkar.
The man who turned an adult then was also at the center of the advertising revolution and in came the colour
TVs
.
Sachin started promoting health drinks, soft drinks, car tyres, colour TVs, financial services corporations, foreign sports shoes and even a private telecom network provider. India was seeing a revolution in most of these sectors and Sachin was the face for most.
What was also gaining power in the 90s was the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Cricket administrator Jagmohan Dalmiya and civil servant I.S. Bindra in 1993 won a case against broadcaster Doordarshan to sell the TV rights of cricket matches in the country. In today's times, the rights are sold for thousands of crores of rupees.
Dalmiya also ensured the subcontinent countries get the hosting rights of the iconic 1996 World Cup tournament, forcing the cricketing nations to take note of how BCCI can arrange the cricket's biggest tournament.
Sachin scored most runs in the 1996 World Cup. He scored 527 runs from just seven matches, coming from a ‘stickerless’ bat, or a bat without a brand sticker. Such is the brand influence of the man, that many aspiring cricketers or even gully players removed stickers from their bats.
He had removed the sticker to not be distracted while piling runs in the tournament.
After the tournament, Sachin had signed a bat sponsorship contract with
MRF
.
The 1996 World Cup TV rights was sold to WorldTel, headed by Mark Mascarenhas – who went on to become Tendulkar’s agent. In 1995, 22-year old Tendulkar signed a five-year contract orchestrated by Mascarenhas. Media reports put the value of the deal in a wide range of Rs 30 crores to Rs 50 crores, the biggest agent deal in cricket's history back then. However, what this did is it opened sports marketing avenues for other cricketers.
Over 20 years after Sachin signed a bat logo sponsorship deal with MRF, the tyre maker signed a deal with
Virat
Kohli for over Rs 100 crore for eight years.
Sachin Aaya Re!
(Sachin has come) was a jingle used by a beverage brand. For real, Sachin as brands' golden child, and liberalisation, ad revolution and BCCI, had arrived.
Trusting Sachin forever
Sachin has collaborated with brands including Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Visa and Adidas among several others. However, he never had to collaborate with items seen to be sin goods or unethical. Sachin is personally far from endorsing liquor brands, tobacco or gambling.
He was also untouched by the match fixing scandal of late 90s and early 2000s, making him someone on whom Indians can trust and further building his spotless brand image.
""Having remained far away from controversies throughout and beyond his career, Sachin has a great deal of credibility attached to his name. For this reason, any brand looking to bolster its credibility, trust, and customer acquisition can rely on him as an influencer,"" said Kunal Kishore, founder and director, Value 360 Communications.
Sachin can be the perfect fit for brands across categories, from financial platforms to healthcare brands and automobile companies. As a tech-savvy individual, he can also represent technology brands, Kishore said. Since his mass appeal is unsurpassed, he could also be the ideal choice for any FMCG brand looking to target a large audience, he added.
However, it's worth noting that employing Sachin Tendulkar or any other celebrity for marketing campaigns can be expensive, so it's important for marketers to consider the affordability of this strategy and whether the return on investment justifies the cost, Cutting Fillum's Pyati said.
Additionally, it's important to ensure that the celebrity's values and image align with the brand's values and messaging to avoid any potential backlash or negative publicity. The world remembers Sachin’s famous ad “Boost is the secret of our energy”, but it can be said that “Sachin is still the secret of effective brand strategy”, he said.
Siddharth Raman, Deputy CEO at Sportz Interactive said, as for affordability, it depends on how much brands are willing to invest. The entire aspect of celebrity endorsement is that you need to make it work in your favour and you need to make every rupee invested work harder than what you would generally need to.
India can't bid adieu
""All my friends. Settle down, let me talk, I will get more and more emotional.""
This is how Sachin started his farewell speech in 2012, where he didn’t ask anyone to ‘lend him their ears’. The man's international career spanning 24 years, or spanning the life of a child born to probably starting with his job, came to a halt.
However, his brand value didn't take a plunge.
Valued at Rs 1,000 crore, Sachin had become the richest Indian cricketer in the early 2010s. According to various media reports, his net worth is around Rs 1,250 crores now. He is still the blue-eyed boy for the country and had reportedly earned Rs 50 crores in 2022 from investments and endorsements.
""It's getting a little bit difficult to talk but I will manage,""
Sachin said as he continued his farewell speech trying to control his emotions.
However, from the nook and corners of this nation and even outside the borders, many couldn't control their emotions. The spectators were teary-eyed, voices choking.
But, the voices do not choke any more, when, even after over a decade of his retirement, crowds in large numbers in any stadium still chant -- Sachiiiin - Sachin!
The brand Sachin can't get old.

Disney Star's Kevin Vaz set to join Viacom18 as CEO,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-stars-kevin-vaz-set-to-join-viacom18-as-ceo/articleshow/99643793.cms,20-04-2023,"Kevin Vaz
, the virtual second-in-command in the
Disney Star
ecosystem and the head of its entertainment business, has resigned from the company after a tenure of over 20 years, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Sources have indicated that the experienced TV broadcast executive will join
Viacom18
as its new CEO. It is also learned that major changes to Viacom18's organisational structure are expected to take place in the upcoming months.
Jyoti
Deshpande is currently serving as the CEO of Viacom18, while Anil Jayaraj holds the CEO position for the sports business. Deshpande also serves as the President of the Media Business at
Reliance Industries
and heads Jio Studios.
In 2021, Vaz was promoted to his current position following a reorganisation within the company. Having spent over 20 years at Disney, Vaz has held several significant positions, including CEO of the regional entertainment business and head of ad sales.
Emails sent to Disney Star and Viacom18 remained unanswered till press time.
Live Events
Incidentally, the development comes a few days after Viacom18 completed the process of allotting shares to Reliance Industries group entities and Bodhi Tree Systems following a record Rs 15,000 crore fund infusion into the company.
Former Star India chief Uday Shankar, who has joined the Viacom18 board, is preparing the blueprint to grow the company, which has become a serious contender in the sports business with the acquisition of Indian
Premier
League (IPL) digital rights.
Vaz joins the long list of executives who have quit Star, with some of them joining Viacom18 following Shankar's entry into the company. In 2021,
Star Sports
ad sales head Anil Jayaraj joined Viacom18 as CEO of the sports business. Around the same time, Disney+ Hotstar ad sales head Gulshan Verma quit the company to join JioAds as CEO.
Prateek Garg, former head of corporate development at
Walt Disney
APAC, has joined Shankar's Marigold Park Capital Advisers as MD.
Recently, Disney+ Hotstar chief technology officer (CTO) Akash Saxena joined Viacom18 as the CTO. Piyush Goyal, who was EVP and head of key accounts at Star, has been roped in as COO of IndiaCast, the content monetisation arm of
TV18
and Viacom18.
There are at least 12 senior-level executives, including former CFO Sanjay Jain, former HR head Amita Maheshwari, former legal head Deepak Jacob, and former ad sales head Nitin Bawankule, who have quit in the last two years.
While Jain had retired from the company, Maheshwari joined Kedaara Capital while Jacob and Bawankule joined Dream11 and Amazon Web Services, respectively.
Currently, Viacom18 is the fourth-largest media network in the country in terms of revenue. The company reported Rs 4145.4 crore in revenue during the fiscal year 2021–22.
Disney Star is the biggest network, with a topline of Rs 17,481 crore in fiscal 2022.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
(ZEEL) ended FY22 with revenues of Rs 8430 crore. Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) recorded revenue of Rs 6746.3 crore during the fiscal.
The Indian media and entertainment (M&E) ecosystem has witnessed three big deals in the last five years.
The first major deal in the Indian M&E space was Walt Disney's acquisition of Star India as part of its global acquisition of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets. Star India was reportedly valued at $14–16 billion by Disney.
The biggest media deal in the sector happened when
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
Limited (ZEEL) announced its merger deal with Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI), which will create a TV broadcasting behemoth. The combined revenue of Zee-Sony would be over Rs 15,000 crore.
Bodhi Tree Systems' Rs 4300 crore investment in Viacom18 for an over 13% stake in the company is the third major deal in the space. Bodhi Tree Systems is co-promoted by Shankar along with James Murdoch, his former boss at 21st Century Fox.

Top Walt Disney executives in India to assess media operations,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/top-walt-disney-executives-in-india-to-assess-media-operations/articleshow/99632319.cms,20-04-2023,"Four senior executives from the
Walt Disney Company
have arrived in India to take stock of the entertainment company's local operations, at a time when it is locked in a tough battle with IPL digital rights holder Viacom18 for revenue, people directly aware of the development told ET.
Nancy Lee, chief of staff to
Disney
CEO Robert Iger; Robert Langer, chief financial officer, Disney-ABC Television Group;
Justin Warbrooke
, executive vice president, finance, Disney Media & Entertainment Distribution; and Sean Corrigan, SVP of corporate strategy and business development at Disney, arrived a few days ago and are still in India, company insiders said.
However, executives at the India unit, Disney Star, called it a “routine visit” to assess the Indian market. They said an organisational restructuring of Disney Star is not on the cards.
""Globally, Disney has four key markets apart from its home market of the United States. These include Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Incidentally, India is the only market that is not part of any region,"" one of the people said, noting that India is an extremely important market for the company.
A media executive in the know of the visit said there is something more to it than meets the eye. ""Disney Star has seen a spate of big exits in the recent past. That could be one of the things that are playing on the minds of the leadership in Burbank. Disney has invested billions of dollars in India, not just on buying
Star India
but also on buying expensive cricket rights,"" the executive said on the condition of anonymity.
Live Events
Disney Star refused to comment.
Globally, Walt Disney is in the midst of restructuring its operations following the return of Bob Iger as CEO in November last year. After his return, Iger has set in motion a plan to save $5.5 billion in costs, which involves cutting thousands of jobs primarily from the company's entertainment division globally.
The visit of the executives, coincidentally, comes at a time when the battle for revenue is at its peak in the Indian market with IPL delivering record viewership.
Disney Star, the TV rights owner of IPL, has a task of at least meeting the roughly Rs 3,200 crore of ad revenue it earned last year on TV alone. Viacom18, which has grabbed the digital rights, is mounting a challenge to Disney Star to grab a large chunk of the advertising money that is spent on IPL this year.
Disney spent Rs 23,575 crore to buy IPL Indian sub-continent TV rights for five years while Viacom18 spent Rs 23,758 crore for the digital rights.
Driving Viacom18 is Uday Shankar, a former chief of Walt Disney's India and Asia Pacific operations. Viacom18, which has a presence in the entertainment, sports, and movie businesses across TV and digital, is majority owned by
Reliance Industries
.
Shankar, along with former 21st Century Fox chief James Murdoch, owns over 13% of Viacom18 through a company called Bodhi Tree Systems. Both Shankar and Murdoch have also raised funding from Comcast Corporation to increase their stake in Viacom18.
Disney-owned Star India is the country's largest media company. It posted revenue of Rs 17,481 crore in fiscal 2022. The Indian market is one of the most important for Disney, which recorded $83 billion in revenue in 2022.

Zee starts talks with creditors to close Sony merger,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/zee-starts-talks-with-creditors-to-close-sony-merger/articleshow/99630362.cms,20-04-2023,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
has started settlement talks with its creditors to repay debts and remove the last hurdle in completing a merger with the Sony Group that would create a $10 billion media giant, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Indian television network has offered
IDBI Bank Ltd
., one of the creditors that moved insolvency court, to repay a loan of about 1.49 billion rupees ($18.1 million) in tranches, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public. Zee’s founders are in separate discussions with
Axis Bank Ltd
. and
JC Flowers
& Co.’s asset reconstruction unit to settle dues of 400 million rupees each made to entities controlled by them, they said.
The repayments are crucial for the merger, which will create a media firm with the biggest viewership and pricing power in the country of more than 1.4 billion people.
Sony Pictures Networks India Pvt
. will own a little more than half the shares once the deal is completed and Zee’s founders will hold 3.99% while public shareholders will get the rest.
Several creditors to the company and its founders had been approaching the
bankruptcy
court seeking repayments. Just last month, the company repaid dues of one creditor
IndusInd Bank Ltd
., and the lender will withdraw its objections against the merger, Zee said in a filing.
Spokesperson for
Axis Bank
bank declined to comment, while representatives for Zee, JC Flowers and
IDBI Bank
didn’t respond to emails and phone calls seeking comments.

"IPL viewership is not a zero-sum game in India as there is ample room of growth for all stakeholders, says Star Sports’ Sanjog Gupta",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-viewership-is-not-a-zero-sum-game-in-india-as-there-is-ample-room-of-growth-for-all-stakeholders-says-star-sports-sanjog-gupta/articleshow/99614627.cms,20-04-2023,"The ongoing
Indian Premier League
has set new viewership records in a year where for the first time the media rights were split between two companies.
Sanjog Gupta
, Head of sports – Disney Star
, said while there is room for both television and digital platforms to grow,
TVs
still command the leadership role based on high penetration, engagement and its immersive nature. In an exclusive interaction with
ET Online’s Gourab Das
, the top official also shed light on viewership numbers, growth markets, consumer behaviour, key company strategies and if the media behemoth will again bid for both digital and TV rights in future.
This is the first year that the media rights for
IPL
have been split into two different broadcasters. Do you see it as a point of concern?
Sanjog Gupta:
Firstly, it is what it is. Anything new and anything which is different from the past always causes a certain level of discomfort, but it could potentially also unlock beyond the value that has been unlocked in media rights for BCCI, consumers and for potential advertisers. It could mean more value for the community at large.
However, I think, where things stand today, we would like to believe and I genuinely believe, it is not a zero-sum game. Sport in this country has enough headroom for growth for multiple stakeholders and multiple rights holders to be able to grow. At the end of the day a rising tide lifts all boats.
Given a chance, will Star bid for both TV and digital rights again?

First 10 IPL games had a cumulative reach of 30.7 crore: Disney Star
Sanjog Gupta:
Yes. But the same question you should ask me may be three-to-four years down the line. It is too early for us to have any second thoughts about bidding for those rights, nothing has changed since we participated in the e-auction a few months back. There is no reason for us to revisit a decision that we took few months back. If anything, we are even more confident of our strategy and now are very sure that
IPL on Star
is on a growth trajectory.
How are you pricing your ad slots competitively and what are the extra benefits that you are providing for the advertisers?
Sanjog Gupta:
I am not at liberty to disclose pricing, but the most interesting thing that we have done is to create packages relevant for advertisers with outlays ranging from a crore to hundreds of crores of rupees. This is unlike past times where perhaps the threshold for minimum outlays was too high for advertisers.
The second thing is around solutions, which is that a lot of brands do not just want exposure but they want to be deeply associated with Star Sports. For example, for
Airtel
5G we have come up with a tech innovation which allows fans, digital avatars to be in the studio and engage with commentators.
IPL viewership
this year is setting records. How do you see the viewership of IPL on television in the first week of the tournament? How does it fare compared with the last few seasons?

IPL is a hit, on TV and digital media
Sanjog Gupta:
We are overwhelmed with the response that IPL on Star has been getting and that is the only way of describing the outcome. While we were very focussed on raising the bar on our coverage and were genuinely committed to growing IPL viewership, a secondary consideration for us obviously this year, given the way that the rights were distributed, was to drive consideration specifically for IPL on Star. I think the
fact
that we have grown significantly compared to last year by almost 25% and have equalled records for IPL set in the past gives us a very strong belief that we have been successful in doing both, driving consideration for IPL and emphatically driving consideration for IPL on Star.
Our peak concurrency for the first 10 matches is 5.6 crores or 56 million, that is the highest peak concurrency that any match in the first 10 days or 10 matches of IPL or 8 days of IPL has achieved ever other than those two pandemic years, which were exceptional years. The fact that 31 crore viewers watched the first 10 matches, which equalled the record for most viewers watching the first 10 matches of IPL other than again those two COVID years, also means that the level of anticipation and preference as a destination that we were able to drive was significant enough for people to flock in really large numbers in the first 10 matches of IPL itself.
Is it going according to your plan and expectations?
Sanjog Gupta:
Given that we were starting a new rights cycle, our ambition was to start on a strong growth trajectory, much the same way as our ambition was in 2018 when we acquired IPL for the first time. We were always believers in the fact that IPL has headroom for growth. It has immense headroom for growth on television, which is why we acquired the TV rights. We believe that in this country television will continue to be a mass aggregator of audiences and will continue to drive the intensity of viewership and consumption as demonstrated by the peak concurrency levels, which have been more than 3x that of the peak concurrency in the same period that digital managed to achieve.
Which are the biggest markets driving the growth of viewership on TV?
Sanjog Gupta:
UP has grown significantly on the back of big initiatives including a tie-up with Lucknow Super Giants, signing up KL Rahul as a brand ambassador and a wider recruitment strategy propelled by deeper penetration of Star Sports 1 Hindi. The second market is Gujarat, where we launched the Gujarati feed for the first time last year and tied up with Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja as our brand ambassadors. The third market that has grown is Karnataka and that is largely on the back of
Virat
Kohli's popularity who again happens to be one of our brand ambassadors. Star Sports 1 Kannada now has almost a 70% share of the total viewership in the state.
The fourth state driving the growth is Delhi and that is on the back of enhanced Hindi feed . The fifth market which has seen most significant growth and has contributed to the overall growth the most is AP, Telangana largely on the back of the launch of Star Sports 1 Telugu and our association with actor Nandamuri Balakrishna who galvanised tier II and tier III towns.
It is interesting that a large part of the growth in AP, Telangana is actually coming from outside Hyderabad and that is largely driven by the initiative to market and make Telugu available as widely as possible. The third factor in the AP, Telangana is the entire feed in Telugu has actually been formatted in a game show format.
How does the viewership fare in comparison with the digital? Is television a dying medium?
Sanjog Gupta:
We have genuinely always believed that TV was not even in any state of illness let alone dying. There was a temporary blip in IPL, which was caused due to multiple extraneous factors and not necessarily caused by people's habit or preference for television.
The peak concurrency for TV across the first 10 matches was 5.6 crores or 56 million. The same peak concurrency for the same 10 matches on digital was 1.8 crores or 18 million. We also clocked 6,230 crore minutes of consumption across these 10 matches. We have seen some numbers around views that have been published by the digital platform, which may be about 550 crores for the first 17 matches.
Do you think digital will have a large impact on tv viewership or are they threats to each other?
It does not have to be a zero-sum game. There is enough headroom for growth across TV and digital.
Yes, TV will continue to be the larger aggregator and will also continue to drive deeper engagement. TV continues to be the preferred destination for marquee sports events where large communities come together to experience the same emotion. Especially in tier II, tier III towns it would not have been possible for IPL to be achieving the kind of scale that it manages to achieve without TV’s penetration.
The number of or the frequency with which you engage with the smaller screen is higher but the average session time and the retention of viewers on that smaller screen tends to be much lower. TV continues to deliver higher peaks of concurrency, as well as more volume of content watched and there is deeper engagement in terms of the time spent per viewer, which happens to be 40% to 50% higher than the average time spent by a viewer watching on the digital platforms.
How do you see a change in behavior or habit of consumers probably in the long run?
Sanjog Gupta:
Look, consumer habits are always evolving. So, it would be foolhardy on my part to say that consumer habits do not evolve and which is why it is important for television to evolve with those consumer habits evolving. That is why a big part of the thrust of our coverage has been around how we adapt to the evolution of the consumer. Some measures have to do with highlighting or almost amplifying the virtues of television or the big screen which drive the consideration for it and some have to do with the addition of new features, which make the big screen either more engaging or more interactive or more immersive. We have tried to do both.
What have been your strategies or technology advancements to grab a larger audience share?
Sanjog Gupta:
Our fundamental thinking started with the acknowledgement that the consumer has evolved. We launched Star Sports VIP and Star Sports Pro on Tata Play and Airtel. Real-time highlights are being served which are being updated every over. The second feature was the replay of key moments whenever you choose to watch them. The third feature was for super fans who want real-time stats from the game available at the drop of a hat. The last and final feature was the feature around following your hero. So, you have the option of pressing a button and seeing at any given point of time what your favorite star in that game is doing. We also launched for the first-time live subtitling or captioning of the commentary.
Steve Smith, Jacques Kallis, David Hussey, Paul Collingwood, all of these guys are also joining us virtually as holograms in our studio and engaging with the commentators. The fourth is we partnered with Dolby and made a request to the BCCI to produce the IPL in Dolby Atmos for all our HD viewers to deliver a more stadium-like feel in the coverage..
Apart from these tech ones, what are you doing to augment the viewership reach and are there any plans you are holding up for midway into the season or something that you have not revealed yet?
Sanjog Gupta:
We signed up a galaxy of superstars who we believed were going to bring the IPL alive. Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja - we created the biggest galaxy of superstars.
We planned a big splash where Salman Khan was a part of our Hindi coverage to tell the stories of IPL. Also, we will have Priyanka Chopra soon. The idea behind doing this is to drive consideration for IPL amongst those who either have not sampled IPL till now or do not have deep interest in IPL but are fans of Bollywood. It is the same effort that we made with Ranveer Singh or with Telugu superstar Nandamuri Balakrishna.
A big part of the strategy was also for the first time offering a sampling opportunity of the IPL to free to air viewers. So, we took select games and made them available on our free to air channel with the view that we will be able to convert some of them into subscribers of Star Sports.
Twitter has been talking about Bhojpuri commentary and you have actors who have no relation with the game being commentators during the match. Don't you think there is a fall in the quality of commentary when you are using that ploy?
Sanjog Gupta:
We are not looking to deliver a feed which is anything but a driver of fandom for IPL and its heroes and its narratives. Even when we get Bollywood stars to be a part of our coverage, it is always with the lens that they are super fans of the game.
We believe that at no point the game should be undermined, that is not something that we believe will drive fandom for the game and thus will yield returns in the long term. Yes, the commentary needs to evolve and commentary needs to evolve with the times. But, to turn coverage of the game into something that is looking to elicit laughter is definitely not the route that we believe over a period of time will yield the fandom, the attention and the viewership that will mean business success.
What advice will you give to brands and marketers looking to navigate the TV vs digital media landscape and how can they effectively use both to reach their target audience?
Sanjog Gupta:
The advice that I would give brands and advertisers is to evaluate platforms based on the objectives that you have for your brand. There is also a strong overlap of consumption that happens for fans driven by the convenience of watching on a screen that is mobile and the comfort/quality of experience that television offers. If a brand wants to be omnipresent and wants to speak to the same consumer across multiple touch points, then there is no reason to not evaluate both digital and television for presence.

BCCI waives off Rs 78.90 crore from 2018-2023 media rights deal with Star,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/bcci-waives-off-rs-78-90-crore-from-2018-2023-media-rights-deal-with-star/articleshow/99557676.cms,17-04-2023,"The
BCCI
has decided to ""waive off"" one match from its media rights agreement (MRA) with
Star India
, amounting to Rs 78.90 crore.
The MRA for the 2018-2023 cycle which ended on March 31 had an ""indicative schedule"" of 102 games at a value of Rs 6138.1 crore but the BCCI ended up organising 103 matches in the five-year cycle.
""It has been resolved to waive off (one) match from the scope of
Star
India Private Limited under the BCCI-Star Media Rights Agreement dated 5th April 2018 for BCCI International and Domestic Matches. The total number of matches during the rights period has now been reduced from 103 to 102,"" read a BCCI note.
However, sources close to Star India say as per the MRA signed in 2018, the board was expected to organise 102 matches, so the scenario of waiving off one match fee should not arise.
""The MRA had 102 games and Star will pay for those matches. I don't see an issue here,"" a source told PTI on Monday.

Star had bid different amounts per game for different years in the previous cycle: Rs 46 crore per game for 2018-19, Rs 47 crore per game for 2019-20, Rs 46 crore per game for 2020-21, Rs 77 crore per game for 2021-2022 and Rs 78.90 crore per game for 2022-23.
As per sources, Star had asked for waiver of Rs 139 crore due to the rescheduling of few games after the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.
Considering that the media rights for the 2023-2027 are up for grabs and Star will be expected to bid alongside Viacom 18 and Sony, the BCCI has decided to waive off Rs 78.90 crore from the previous media rights value.
The board will have high expectations for the home season rights after making windfall gains of Rs 48,390 crore from the IPL media rights.

A portion of the funds from NBC Universal's investment in BTS Investment and Bodhi Tree Systems will be used for additional investment in Viacom18.
NBC Universal, which is owned by Comcast, currently has a subsidiary in India named NBC Universal Media Distribution Services Pvt Ltd.
In 2021, the company introduced DreamWorks and E! channels on the Jio TV app. It also operates an ad-free OTT platform called Hayu in India.
Much before it was acquired by Comcast, NBC Universal had acquired a 26% equity stake in
NDTV
for $150 million in 2008. Later, NDTV bought back the stake. NDTV Networks housed the entertainment and lifestyle channels of NDTV.
Comcast has been looking to gain a toehold in the Indian market.
Comcast had reportedly evaluated both
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
and Star India as potential targets at one point.
Comcast, in partnership with private equity heavyweight Blackstone Group and Lupa Systems CEO James Murdoch, had tried to acquire a stake in Zee when the media conglomerate was seeking a strategic investor to sell a portion of its stake to pay off debts owed by its promoters. However, the bid was unsuccessful.
The company was vying for Star India when 21st Century Fox put a large chunk of its entertainment assets on sale. Eventually, Disney walked away with the 21st Century Fox assets, including Star India.
Comcast had to remain content with the acquisition of British media and telecommunications company Sky.
Industry sources said Comcast had looked at assets in the TV distribution space too before it evaluated Zee and Star.
""Initially, it had looked at assets in the cable TV business, but it didn't proceed further due to a lack of last-mile ownership. They also evaluated DTH assets, but that also didn't yield any results,"" a TV broadcast executive aware of the discussions said.
As per a person familiar with the matter, Viacom18 has achieved a valuation of ₹33,000 crore following the injection of funds by Bodhi Tree Systems.

Disney Star gets record TV viewership for IPL in Hindi Speaking Markets,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-star-gets-record-tv-viewership-for-ipl-in-hindi-speaking-markets/articleshow/99510528.cms,15-04-2023,"Cash-rich
Indian Premier League
is shattering records on viewership in this season and this time Disney Star, the official television broadcaster of the cricket tournament, has garnered highest viewership in the history of
IPL
in the so-called Hindi Speaking Markets, or HSM.
A total of 20.4 crore viewers tuned in for the first 10 matches on TV, reflecting a 29.5% increase in comparison to the last edition, the company said in a statement. HSM also clocked a massive 4,380 crore minutes of watch time, 25% increase in comparison to last year, it said.
The significant centers for growth in HSM markets included UP, Bihar, MP, Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Haryana. Moreover, the South markets also witnessed a growth of 21% on year, with AP/Telangana witnessing a 33% consumption growth and Karnataka recording a 30% growth, clocking 680 crore minutes for the first 10 matches, highest ever consumption (other than Covid years) in IPL history.
This comes even as Disney Star is up against business tycoon Mukesh Ambani's OTT JioCinema that is the official digital streaming platform of the multi-franchise cricket league that is almost celebrated as a festival in the cricket-crazy nation of 1.4 billion people.
India has been seeing a spike in demand for regional content as
South Indian
movies keep beating the otherwise dominant Bollywood movies. Now, local language commentary for cricket is certainly what viewers are going for as well.

Rajeev Chandrasekhar
said in a live Twitter session on Friday. During the session on Twitter, the minister stood firm on new rules to notify a fact checker that will identify false or misleading content related to the government on social media platforms.
""When you do an analysis over the last....2-3 years, a large part of the misinformation operations have always been directed against the government,"" Chandrasekhar said.
He cited a Washington Post story, which talks about Khalistani bots and accounts posting fake information about the government.
""Misinformation directed towards the government needed to be addressed. This was a request not just by the users of the internet, but also the intermediaries who now have to comply with Rules...and because it was government information and government facts, it cannot be a fact-checking unit outside the government because they'll never have access to the information,"" Chandrasekhar said.
The new rules have come under sharp criticism from various sections of society.

The
Editors Guild of India
has said that it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the ""draconian"" amendments to the Information Technology Rules that gave the government ""absolute power"" to determine
fake news
.
In a statement, the guild has urged the government to withdraw the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules and hold consultations with media organisations and press bodies, as it had promised earlier.
The guild said as per the rules, the IT Ministry has given itself the power to constitute a ""fact-checking unit"", which will have sweeping powers to determine what is ""fake or false or misleading"", with respect to ""any business of the Central Government"".
Non-profit digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) has said that assigning any unit of the government such arbitrary powers to determine the authenticity of online content bypasses the principles of natural justice, thus making it an unconstitutional exercise.
""The notification of these amended rules cement the chilling effect on the fundamental right to speech and expression, particularly on news publishers, journalists, activists, etc,"" IFF said.
Internet firms like Google, Facebook and Twitter may lose protection under safe harbour if they fail to remove content identified by the government-notified fact-checker as false or misleading information.
Internet and social media platforms, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and internet service providers etc, fall within the ambit of an intermediary.
The safe harbour clause protects intermediaries from legal action on them for any objectionable content posted online by their users.

"James Murdoch's Bodhi Tree slashes planned investment in Reliance JV Viacom18 by 70% to Rs 4,306 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/james-murdochs-bodhi-tree-slashes-planned-investment-in-reliance-jv-viacom18-by-70-to-rs-4306-crore/articleshow/99488129.cms,14-04-2023,"Bodhi Tree
, a joint venture between
James Murdoch
and a former Star India executive, has reduced its planned investment in
Reliance
's broadcast venture
Viacom18
by 70% and will now pump in Rs 4,306 crore ($527.84 million), Viacom18 said late on Thursday.
Billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
's
Reliance Industries
had said in April last year that Qatar Investment Authority-backed Bodhi Tree would spend Rs 13,500 crore out of a planned Rs 15,145 crore investment in the media behemoth that is also backed by
Paramount Global
.
Reliance is now leading the investment with a Rs 10,839 crore infusion.
A source familiar with the matter said the investment amount was reduced due to a broader funding squeeze amid a slowdown in dealmaking.
Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity shrank to the lowest level in more than a decade in the first quarter of 2023, as rising interest rates, high inflation and fears of a recession soured the appetite of companies for dealmaking.

Adani Group brand custodian Aman Kumar Singh resigns from NDTV board,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/adani-group-brand-custodian-aman-kumar-singh-resigns-from-ndtv-board/articleshow/99354537.cms,09-04-2023,"Adani
group's corporate brand custodian and head of corporate affairs Aman Kumar Singh, who is facing a corruption charge in
Chhattisgarh
, has resigned from the board of
NDTV Ltd
due to other preoccupations. In a stock exchange filing,
New Delhi Television Ltd
last week said, ""Aman
Kumar Singh
has tendered his resignation from the position of non-executive director of the company, with effect from close of business hours on April 1, 2023, due to his preoccupation with other engagements"".
Singh, a former
Indian Revenue Service Officer
, was a powerful bureaucrat in the Raman Singh-led BJP government in Chhattisgarh and was the principal secretary to the chief minister.
He resigned from service and joined the Adani group in November 2022 as the Corporate Brand Custodian and Corporate Affairs head. And when Adani took control of NDTV, Singh was one of the directors the Adani group appointed to the board of the news broadcaster.
In February 2020, the economic offences wing (EOW) of Chhattisgarh registered an FIR against Singh and his wife Yasmeen Singh in an alleged disproportionate assets case.
The High Court quashed the FIR, but the Supreme Court last month set aside the HC order, saying it was desirable that the High Courts do not quash corruption case FIRs at the investigation stage, even if it is suspected that the case has been registered by a new government against officers of the previous government.

After the Supreme Court order, Aman Singh appeared before the EOW on March 6. A week later, his plea for anticipatory bail was rejected by an additional district and sessions judge court in Raipur.
Singh is the second nominee of the Adani group to have resigned from the
NDTV board
.
On March 9, NDTV, in a stock exchange filing, stated that Sunil Kumar has resigned as an additional non-executive independent director of the company.
Kumar, a 1979-batch IAS officer, was chief secretary of Chhattisgarh from 2012 to 2014.

Media bodies reject proposal for unified legal framework,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/media-bodies-reject-proposal-for-unified-legal-framework/articleshow/99337538.cms,08-04-2023,"Media bodies have opposed a suggestion by
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
Trai
) to establish a comprehensive legal framework for telecom and broadcasting services in a joint submission to the regulator’s consultation paper.
There is no requirement for a separate comprehensive code to address the convergence between broadcasting and telecommunication services,
Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation
(IBDF),
Internet and Mobile Association of India
(IAMAI),
Digital News Publishers Association
(DNPA),
Association of Radio Operators for India
(AROI), and
All India Digital Cable Federation
(AIDCF) said in their submission.
Trai had launched a consultation paper in January to obtain feedback from stakeholders in telecom and broadcasting sectors on regulating converged digital technologies and services.
IBDF, leading industry body of TV broadcasting in India, has contended that telecom and broadcasting are distinct services and should have separate laws.
Bundling different services like TV, broadband, and voice into one offering does not signify convergence between the services, IBDF stated in its submission. There is no device, service, or carriage convergence between telecom and broadcasting services, it pointed out.

IBDF opined that separate but coordinated frameworks are most appropriate for the Indian context.
According to AROI, Trai should prioritise addressing the issue of vertical integration and prevent telcos from controlling broadcast content and carriage entities. The FM radio body recommended extending the vertical integration rule, which limits DTH operators to a maximum 20% stake in broadcast companies, to telcos as well.
AIDCF, which represents major cable TV distribution firms, said it is too early to establish a comprehensive policy for the two services. It suggested that the regulator first create a common regulatory and licensing framework for all similar service providers before conducting a thorough assessment of a service-specific regulatory and administrative system.
It also noted that the issues related to the convergence of broadcast carriage platforms and telecom services are specific to telcos that are providing mobile communication, fibre, and DTH via a single optical fibre, which is not viable for cable TV companies.
AIDCF also highlighted that there is a technological barrier to converging the two services, as cable TV technology is a one-way service while telecom services use two-way interactive technology.
DNPA, a group of news publishers in India, stated Trai’s consultation paper is based on a flawed understanding of convergence.
A converged regulatory and legal framework could lead to smaller broadcasters and distribution platforms going out of business due to the promotion of gatekeeping practices, it said. DNPA emphasised the need for fair competition and transparent regulation to ensure that all players in the media and telecom industries have equal opportunities.
While pointing out that tech giants Google and Facebook have become a duopoly in the digital advertising market, the association stated that a converged regime will only enable the creation of monopolies by a few cash-rich telecom companies.
IAMAI submitted that there were existing laws governing broadcasting, the internet, and telecom services. It said convergence of some statutes and institutional frameworks relating to the carriage of broadcasting and telecom services already existed.
Further, it noted that Trai is the common regulator for telecom and broadcasting carriage, while the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) is the dispute settlement body for both sectors. Allotment of spectrum to both sets of operators is also approved by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), it said.

"'Overwhelming response', says Disney Star; IPL TV viewership returns to pre-pandemic levels as viewer fatigue wears away",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/overwhelming-response-says-disney-star-ipl-tv-viewership-returns-to-pre-pandemic-levels-as-viewer-fatigue-wears-away/articleshow/99333572.cms,08-04-2023,"The
Indian Premier League
(IPL) has seen a significant increase in TV viewership for its season opener between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings. According to BARC data, the opening fixture clocked a total of 8.7 billion minutes of consumption on TV, which is 47% more than last year and the highest ever, other than
IPL
editions played during the pandemic-induced lockdown.
However, recent reports suggest that the IPL's TV ratings have declined in the past couple of years due to viewer fatigue.
Star Sports
recorded a TVR of 5.6 for the opening fixture in 2022, the lowest in the last six editions.
As viewers returned to their TV screens for the sixth time in three years, they found other distractions when India returned to a more normal way of life after a nearly 21-month lockdown, leading to a decline in TV viewership. The TVR for the opening fixture saw a decline from 2020 (10.36) to 2021 (8.25) and further to 2022 (5.6).
The entertainment industry is not alone in experiencing sharp rises and falls due to the pandemic. The travel and hospitality industry has seen a sharp decline in revenue and demand due to travel restrictions and lockdowns. However, with the easing of restrictions and the return of normalcy, many businesses in this sector have seen a surge in demand.
Similarly, the e-commerce industry has seen a significant increase in demand as more people turned to online shopping during the lockdowns. With the rise in vaccination rates and the gradual return of normalcy, this sector has also seen a decline in demand and now gradually returning to pre-pandemic levels.

However, the recent season opener's TVR of 7.29 indicates that IPL fatigue is now behind us, and the TV viewership in 2023 has returned to a more normal level. This TVR is comparable to 8.0 in 2019 and 7.2 in 2018.
As per the information received, the average time spent per viewer watching IPL on TV in 2023 is the second-highest if one were to exclude the peak Covid-19 years of 2020 and 2021. Time spent per viewer in 2023 was 76 minutes compared to 78 minutes in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, the average time spent per viewer stood at 81 minutes and 79 minutes, respectively.
Sanjog Gupta, Head - Sports, Disney Star, in a statement in response to the opening day viewership said, ""We are humbled with the overwhelming response that #IPLonStar has received from fans across the country. The massive growth in viewing time is a testament to the success of our campaign, focus on building virtues of Star Sports' broadcast, continuing dominance of linear Television as the preferred platform for uninterrupted viewing of live Cricket and most of all, the deep relationship we share with Cricket fans.""
The IPL's TV viewership has returned to pre-pandemic levels after initially dropping due to viewer fatigue. With the recent increase in TV viewership and time spent per viewer, it remains to be seen whether the IPL can sustain this trend throughout the current season.

AIDCF to decide on challenging Kerala HC order against tariff appeal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/cable-operators-plan-to-challenge-kerala-hc-order-against-tariff-appeal/articleshow/99263910.cms,05-04-2023,"The

""We are looking into the possibility of challenging the Kerala HC judgement before the division bench. Our members will meet before taking a final call on this. We will study the order copy to understand the grounds on which our petition was dismissed,"" said a top cable TV official, on condition of anonymity.
On Monday, the single-member bench of Justice Shaji P. Chaly dismissed the AIDCF's writ petition challenging the

""I am of the view that the petitioners (AIDCF) have failed to establish any illegality, arbitrariness, unbridled exercise of power, mala fides or any other legal infirmities of similar nature in the 2022 Regulations and the Tariff Order so as to interfere with the same, exercising the power conferred under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,"" the bench said in a 50-page order.
The HC had reserved its judgement on March 7 after AIDCF, TRAI, and the Indian Broadcasting and

Last month, the AIDCF-aligned MSOs signed interconnection agreements with the broadcasters based on NTO 3.0 after failing to secure interim relief from the HC. The truce was preceded by a week-long standoff between the IBDF and the AIDCF.
Disney Star, Culver Max Entertainment (
Sony
), and
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
Limited (ZEEL) switched off signals of their channels to the MSOs after the latter refused to sign deals based on the amended regulation. The signal blackout impacted millions of cable TV customers across India.
In January, AIDCF filed a writ petition challenging the amendments notified by the TRAI in November 2022 to its tariff order and interconnection regulations. The federation had also sought a stay on the implementation of the amended tariff order, which came into effect on February 1.
Following the notification of NTO 3.0, the broadcasters hiked the prices of their bouquets for Hindi-speaking markets by roughly 10% and by over 20% in the case of regional channel bouquets.
The AIDCF had contended that the price hike was anywhere from 18% to 35% and would lead to subscriber churn. It stated that the pay-TV industry has already lost millions of subscribers in the last three years.
The broadcasters had argued that the price hike was taking place after four years and is nominal in nature compared to the inflation growth.
On November 22, the regulator amended the NTO 2.0 by reinstating the old price cap of Rs 19 per channel and doing away with the ‘twin conditions’ in its amended tariff order.
It also mandated that a broadcaster could offer a maximum discount of 45% on pay-channel bouquets over the sum of the MRPs of all the pay channels in that bouquet.
In its petition, the AIDCF had contended that there was no basis to increase the price cap to Rs 19 when the previous price cap of Rs 12 was upheld by the Bombay High Court.
It also argued that a 45% discount cap for broadcaster bouquets had been prescribed without any effective consultation or justification, though the discount on distributor bouquets had been capped at 15%.
The AIDCF said the revised channel and bouquet pricing announced by the broadcasters after the notification of tariff amendments would lead to 20–40% higher prices for subscribers.
The TRAI, on the other hand, argued that the price cap of Rs 19 was upheld by the Supreme Court. It had also contended that the price cap of Rs 12 cannot be considered a basis to assess the price hike as it was never implemented. It was also noted that the industry has been operating under the Rs 19 price cap since 2019.

Ambani's IPL streaming playbook goes beyond the number fight versus Disney Star,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ambanis-ipl-streaming-playbook-goes-beyond-the-number-fight-versus-disney-star/articleshow/99230331.cms,04-04-2023,"Indian Premier League
, the world's richest cricket league, has begun with usual success, delivering the thrills of an articulated
Virat
Kohli innings or gigantic sixes hit by
MS Dhoni
. This edition of IPL has gone through three rule changes, but the biggest change for the cash-rich tournament is how it is broadcast for the same audience on different platforms by separate companies.
For the first time, two companies - Disney Star and
Mukesh Ambani
's Viacom18, are broadcasting the matches on television and digital platforms, respectively. The companies had spent a bagful of money to pick up the broadcast rights. What they also did was set up a fierce rivalry to either establish the dominance of television viewership or change the habit to adopt OTT as the preferred mode for watching cricket.
Six matches into the IPL, both companies have pat their own backs on how well their viewership is and the reason for them to cheer the numbers. However, the numbers for television viewing exceeds that of OTT. This is on expected lines given India's muted fast-Internet reach, expensive data and most importantly, lower smartphone penetration compared to TV sets.
Inside Jio Cinema's 147 crore video views
Viacom18, a joint venture between
Reliance Industries
and Paramount Global, said JioCinema, the official digital streaming partner of IPL, clocked over 147 crore video views, recording the highest-ever opening weekend for the tournament on digital.

The company said the average time spent per viewer per match touched 57 minutes. The platform attracted over 10 crore new viewers and witnessed 5 crore new app downloads during the weekend.
However, the 147 crore video views do not mean 147 crore viewers.
Karan Taurani, senior vice president and media analyst at Elara Capital, explained that the average time spent is 57 minutes and so in that one hour some users could have logged in and logged out to two-to-four times. On average, a user started and stopped watching the match around three times in a day, or nine times over Friday-to-Sunday.
""This means, if there are 15-to-18 crore viewers and they have logged in and out nine times, you will get the number around 147 crore video views,"" he said.

However, there wasn't a smooth beginning as viewers took to social media platforms to criticise the app for crashing, buffering issues and loss of audio feed for two straight matches, including the the first match of the season between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings.

Premier
League, said it has seen a 47% on-year jump in consumption for the opening match, while its TV rating also spiked 29%.
The broadcaster said it clocked a total of 870 crore minutes of consumption on TV for the opening match between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings on March 31. Fourteen crore viewers tuned in for the live broadcast on the opening day, which included the opening ceremony with 13 crore viewers.
Disney Star said, citing BARC data, it saw a sharp 29% growth in TVR compared to the previous IPL edition. Over 20 crore viewers watched the build-up programming for TATA IPL 2023 even before the tournament began on Friday.
The company had bagged the TV rights for the Indian subcontinent, paying Rs 23,575 crore.
Disney Star's sponsors are Tata Neu, Dream11,
Airtel
, Coca-Cola, Pepsi,
Asian Paints
, Cadbury, Jindal Panther, Parle Biscuits,
Britannia
, RuPay, Kamla Pasand, and
LIC
.
Ambani's playbook vs Star's legacy
Experts opined that Asia’s richest tycoon Mukesh Ambani's OTT platform streaming the IPL this time wasn't aiming to win all viewers. He is keen to plant a dominant position for consumer super-apps while his flagship telecom company attracts customers from Sunil Mittal's
Bharti Airtel
and financially strained Vodafone Idea.
Ambani is also seen close to listing JIo Platforms on the stock indices.
His disruptive playbook of offering free streaming, like during the FIFA World Cup, harps on getting larger advertisers to sign chequebooks or even
Reliance
promoting its own products, particularly the FMCG items where the business kingpin has set eyes to dominate the market.
Ambani is bolstering retail consumer play, while his closest rival Gautam Adani is busy arresting wealth erosion following Hindenburg's allegations.
""Ambani has the funds and the mindset to play the long game and his gambit to telecast IPL free is aimed at changing consumer behaviour over the longer term,"" Swarup Gupta, financial services lead and head, ESG ratings service, at Economist Intelligence Unit, told ET Online.
""This strategy is unlikely to translate into revenues in the short to medium term, whether it is in terms of subscription fees, or advertising revenues, but will certainly boost the popularity of the Jio app. Over the longer run, and if this becomes a yearly phenomenon, it could lead to widespread change in viewer behaviour,"" he added.
On the other hand, Star Sports has set a target to reach 500 million viewers this year through IPL, higher than the roughly 400 million that the network reached in previous editions.
Star Sports is broadcasting IPL on more than 22 channels with over 10 feeds. It also launched Star Sports Pro and VIP for some DTH operators, bringing in digital features to tv sets. The new features offer match highlights, in-depth stats and other digital features within a live match.
Industry reports of EY-FICCI and Affle have confirmed that the smartphone penetration in India is close to 460 million, which is just half of the television penetration in India. Data cost is another major factor that is likely to slow down the interest to watch matches on OTTs.

JioCinema clocked over 147 crore video views in the opening IPL weekend: Viacom18,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/jiocinema-clocked-over-147-crore-video-views-in-the-opening-ipl-weekend-viacom18/articleshow/99205978.cms,03-04-2023,"JioCinema

IPL 2023 Live Streaming: When and where to watch IPL matches live online and on television, check all details here
India's money-spinning IPL razzmatazz is back home with rivalries and more business
Viacom is offering free streaming of IPL 2023 on its OTT JioCinema, after
Reliance
picked the lion's share of IPL broadcasting rights (for 2023-2027) for a total of Rs 23,758 crore.
Disney Star

Earlier, Disney Hotstar used to stream the matches.
IPL has opened the gates of the stadiums for spectators after three years when only a limited number of people were allowed to watch it due to Covid restrictions. More than rivalries of the teams, the IPL this time also stands out to gauge the preference of Indians with regard to on which platform they would want to watch the games - on TV or digital apps. However, Reliance's streaming app crash and other issues isn't the start the company would have hoped for.

The
Indian Premier League
this year promises new rivalries that are not restricted to teams but have crossed over to broadcasters. The money-spinner is also set to earn big bucks for franchises as sponsors pour in sackful of money.
The tournament will be played in India after three years where spectators are allowed as well, who were a big miss in recent Covid-stricken years. Popular celebrities are also expected to adorn the galleries. It could also turn out to be the final IPL season for former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, helping stakeholders play on the sentiment of the mavericks.
IPL also has set three new rules, promising the games to be more pacy and exciting.
The razzmatazz is crazy for the fans and the players, who along with support staff and franchisee members, will be travelling across the country over the next 52 days till May 28 playing a total of 74 matches.

India is seeing inflationary pressure where prices of staple pulses to essential medicines have jumped while the unemployment rate poses a grim picture.
However, the cricket frenzy takes over for a significant part of the population in the urban, small towns and even in most parts of the hinterland, who directly or indirectly dole out cash for IPL in several ways.
Indians will soon be burning increased broadband data or buying cable tv packs to watch the 52-day event, consuming high electricity when the nation's grids are stressed with surging power demand amid scorching summer days. Potential stadium, restaurant or pub visits for live action, fantasy gaming and merchandise purchases, among others, add to the bills.
In
fact
, consumers are exposed to a volume of brands and may go ahead making impulsive purchases. The sponsors therefore are not pouring money for nothing.

Star & Jio: Time to add revenues
ET reported on Friday citing multiple industry executives that the IPL will generate more than Rs 5,000 crore from TV and digital advertising in 2023 based on the deals Disney Star and Viacom 18 have closed so far. These two companies are in a tough competition to generate maximum revenue after they picked up TV and digital rights separately worth billions of rupees.
Reliance
won the lion's share of IPL broadcasting rights (for 2023-2027) for a total of Rs 23,758 crore. Disney Star bagged the TV rights for the Indian subcontinent, paying Rs 23,575 crore.
Disney Star is believed to have closed sponsorship deals worth Rs 2,400 crore and is in negotiations to close another Rs 600 crore of transactions, ET reported citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Viacom18, which has set an ad sales target of Rs 3,700 crore, has closed deals worth Rs 2,700 crore, as per a company executive, who did not want to be named.
Disney Star's sponsors are Tata Neu, Dream11,
Airtel
, Coca-Cola, Pepsi,
Asian Paints
, Cadbury, Jindal Panther, Parle Biscuits,
Britannia
, RuPay, Kamla Pasand, and
LIC
.
Viacom, which will be streaming the event for free on its OTT JioCinema has Dream11 as a co-presenting sponsor. It has also got sponsorships from JioMart, PhonePe, Tata Neu, AJIO, Parle Agro, ET Money,
Castrol
, Haier,
TVS
, Cadbury,
ITC
, Coca-Cola, Kamla Pasand, Puma,
Ultratech Cement
, Kingfisher, Rapido, Amazon, Louis Philippe and Indeed, which recently announced layoffs.
Sponsorship & money deals
The cash-rich tournament has now become a decacorn with a $10.9 billion valuation and is said to be the country’s first unicorn in 2008 at $1.1 billion in valuation at inception, according to an analysis by D&P Advisory. A KPMG survey had reported that the tournament contributed Rs 11.5 billion ($182 million) to the domestic economy in 2021, even when played within confines adhering to Covid protocols.
It is obvious that brands would like to be associated with something so huge. Tata has likely paid around Rs 670 crore for two years of title sponsorship of IPL. However, sponsorships go beyond the ordinary and you have umpire, stumps or even audio and headgear sponsors.
Rajasthan Royals recently roped in UBON to be their audio and headgear sponsor.
""Compared to other sports leagues, including international events, IPL offers more extended periods for sponsorships, which can help brands achieve higher visibility and recall,"" Mandeep Arora, Managing Director, and Spokesperson of UBON, told ET Online.
""The league also offers a versatile range of advertising and branding opportunities, including jersey sponsorships, on-ground advertising, and digital promotions, headgear and audio sponsors, banking sponsors which help brands massively to reach its target audience in their budgets,"" Arora said.
This year small finance banks starting from Equitas to
Ujjivan Small Finance Bank
have also increasingly joined the wagon to put in money as sponsors.
Reliance-owned sports marketing company Rise Worldwide has inked 60 deals worth Rs 400 crore for this season, excluding Mumbai Indians' deals. Meanwhile, ITW Catalyst has stitched over 20 different sponsorship deals for multiple IPL teams.
The appeal of IPL is such that NYSE-listed Herbalife is banking on IPL partnership to help with its ambitious expansion in tier 2 and tier 3 cities in India.
Fantasy sports apps have also surged in recent years and they make a killing from the IPL session.
""IPL is not just India’s biggest sporting event, it's also one of the biggest draws on the global cricket calendar. While IPL does translate into growth for the fantasy sports user base, at the same time, the Fantasy Sports experience also adds substantially to the viewer experience by bringing in interactivity and transforming the passive TV viewer into an engaged enthusiast."" said Joy Bhattacharjya, Director-General at Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports.
To be sure, some former partners of the cricket league, such as Amazon Prime, Byju’s, Unacademy, PhonePe and Swiggy, have decided to stay away from this season to save costs.
Franchises eye big money
IPL team owners cumulatively spent Rs 167 crore in a so-called mini auction of players in December last year. At the mega auction for the 2022 season, the teams had spent a record Rs 551.7 crore to pick cricketers.
The franchises this season are aiming for high monetary gains. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Mumbai Indians is said to have recorded a 20-22% increase in sponsorship revenue for the 2023 edition of IPL, having roped in 11 new sponsors and taking the total sponsor count to 25.
CVC Capital Partners-owned Gujarat Titans, which only began playing last year, will clock 35% on-year growth in revenue from the upcoming edition of the tournament. Gujarat Titans had earned sponsorship revenue worth Rs 65 crore from the previous year's IPL.
Rajasthan Royals is looking to triple its revenue from sponsorship and ticketing in the next four years, CEO Jake Lush McCrum told ET.
According to market estimates, each of the 10 IPL franchises is expected to garner sponsorship revenue between Rs 100 to 120 crore. IPL central revenue pool which includes media rights income and central sponsorship revenue is shared in equal proportion between the BCCI and the franchises.
IPL lives strong
Brendon McCullum's blistering 158 runs for Kolkata Knight Riders in the inaugural match against Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008 had set the stage on fire for IPL. Through the years legends of the game like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly or Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers have led to several fireworks on the ground, helping build the brand.
However, it wasn't always easy for the tournament as match fixing scandals, considered one of the biggest evils of the game, has haunted authorities and team owners on a few occasions. The brand has nonetheless stood strong over these 15-16 years, a time period when favorite cricketers of 90s kids retired and the new generation started adoring the Kohlis, Sharmas or recent Gills.
