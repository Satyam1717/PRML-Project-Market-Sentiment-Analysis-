Tech and telecom companies seek sops for submarine cable infra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/companies-seek-sops-for-submarine-cable-infra/articleshow/119496008.cms,26-03-2025,"Technology and telecom companies are seeking government incentives such as lower licence fees on cable landing stations, declaring subsea cables as critical assets, tax exemptions on cable imports and creation of a separate cable corridor to attract more investments in
submarine cable infrastructure
in India.
Companies such as telecom operator
Bharti Airtel
and social media giant Meta—the owner of WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram—put forward these demands during an industry event on subsea cable infrastructure.
“If we want to spur up investments in subsea, we need to incentivise the sector to go ahead further...can we look at the licence fee on the cable landing stations. We have to declare the cable as a strategic national asset; there should be tax exemption on import of cables etc,” Rahul Vatts, chief regulatory officer at
Bharti Airtel
said at the event.
Scott Cowling, director, network investments at Meta said the sector should not be overregulated if India wants to emerge as a leader in digital infrastructure.
“We create an attractive environment so that companies don't just have to come but they want to come because they know that there is reliability and confidence in the process,” said Cowling.

On Meta’s investments in India, he said the US company has landed three subsea cables to date. It excludes the recently announced Project Waterworth.
“These multi-billion dollar cable systems help in providing greater diversity, reliability and capacity to power India's growing internet ecosystem and economic growth,” he said.
According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the global submarine communication cable market is expected to grow 7.2% compounded annually to $40.58 billion in 2028 from $27.57 billion in 2023. The Indian market—the fastest growing in the Asia Pacific region—is expected to reach $78.6 million by 2030.
Cowling said India has all the opportunities for becoming one of the leading global infrastructure leaders in the coming years with the country already being one of the world’s top five economies with a highly educated and young demographic makeup and is advantageously positioned geographically.
“As for these reasons and many more, Meta is focussed on increasing our investments in India. Project Waterworth is really centered on India...with landing stations on both east and west coast. This is just one tangible example of the future importance that we see in India, and I can assure you, there is much more to come,” Cowling said.
With Meta pushing the paddle on submarine cable investments for building a robust digital infrastructure, Bharti Airtel said the company has been making investments in subsea cables in India for the past 25 years, which it is continuing to expand upon to meet growing demand for data.
Historically, the telecom and tech industries have been at loggerheads in terms of telecom infrastructure investments with the former claiming that it makes most of the investments while the latter is a mere user utilising those investments. Telcos have been seeking a fair share from tech firms to compensate them for their large capital spends on building networks.
“We started the investments not today but 25 years ago where we made the first investment in the international cable business. We built the first private submarine cable connecting India to Singapore using an eight-pair fibre cable system and we have made investments in 11 different cable systems with over $800 million over this time,” said Vatts.
He noted that Airtel has around 400,000 route km of fiber and 10 large data centres, and that the company has invested in 34 large cable systems globally.

Telecom dept rejects Trai views on infra sharing by service providers backed by public fund,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telecom-dept-rejects-trai-views-on-infra-sharing-by-service-providers-backed-by-public-fund/articleshow/119493763.cms,25-03-2025,"New Delhi: The Department of Telecom has rejected
Trai
views on passive infrastructure sharing by service providers supported by public fund, according to a document released by the telecom regulator. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had last year recommended that the Department of Telecom (
DoT
) should explore the feasibility of issuing instructions to such USPs that the USP (universal service provider) shall not refuse to share the passive infrastructure laid under the project with at least two other telecom service providers on a transparent and nondiscriminatory basis.
USPs are the entities that build and provide telecom services in rural and remote areas with support from
Universal Service Obligation Fund
(USOF) which has been renamed as
Digital Bharat Nidhi
.
The Department of Telecom in its communication sent to Trai for seeking clarifications on some of the recommendations over ""telecommunication infrastructure sharing, spectrum sharing and spectrum leasing"" said that this suggestion of the regulator ""May not be accepted"" without elaborating on any reason.
The regulator said that in absence of any supporting justification or rationale provided by DoT for not accepting the recommendation, ""the Authority is constrained to reiterate the Recommendation"".
Trai, however, has relented on DoT suggestion over inter-band spectrum sharing that ""any frequency spectrum should be permitted to be shared under inter-band access spectrum sharing only after a lock-in period of two years from the date of its acquisition"".
Live Events
DoT has expressed concern over the lock-in period of two years proposed by Trai.
Trai realised that if its recommendation is implemented then a telecom operator will not share its existing spectrum if it adds even a small amount of spectrum in the same band for a period of two years.
The regulator accordingly modified the recommendation.
""The access spectrum in any frequency band should be permitted to be shared under inter-band access spectrum sharing if at least 80 per cent of the spectrum holding in the frequency band meets the condition of the lock-in period of two years from the date of its acquisition,"" Trai said.

"Vodafone Idea, Jio, Airtel likely set for relief worth thousands of crores as govt plans SUC waiver",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/vodafone-idea-jio-airtel-likely-set-for-relief-worth-thousands-of-crores-as-govt-plans-suc-waiver/articleshow/119416005.cms,24-03-2025,"The government is set to waive spectrum usage charges (SUC) for airwaves acquired through auctions before September 2021, a move expected to provide telecom companies with relief worth thousands of crores. The decision will help
Vodafone Idea
,
Airtel
, and
Reliance Jio
conserve cash as they expand 5G services and strengthen their networks, an official source told The Times of India.
In June 2022, the government removed SUC for spectrum auctioned after September 15, 2021. However, no decision had been taken regarding airwaves purchased in earlier auctions. Now, the waiver is expected to be extended to pre-2021 spectrum as well.
""The move to waive off SUC for spectrum bought through auctions before 2022 is likely to be approved soon. The plan is to give relief to the telecom companies so that their network expansion work continues strongly,"" the source said.
Officials believe that competitive bidding in previous auctions had already ensured fair pricing, making further taxation through SUC unnecessary. Currently, telecom operators pay SUC at 3-4% of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) and an 8% licence fee, which includes a 5% contribution to the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
""The matter has already been discussed within DoT and relevant ministries, and an announcement on the waiver can come soon,"" the source added.

One of the biggest beneficiaries of the waiver is likely to be
Vodafone Idea
, which is struggling under a debt burden exceeding ₹2 lakh crore. ""It is believed that the company may get a benefit of around ₹8,000 crore,"" the source said.
The waiver comes at a time when
Indian telecom operators
are preparing for the entry of Elon Musk’s Starlink, which is launching a ₹2-lakh-crore venture in the sector. However, while local telecom firms will see their SUC obligations eliminated, Starlink will still be required to pay charges on its spectrum.
""The reason for Starlink and other satellite operators being asked for SUC is that they will get the spectrum on an administrative basis instead of competitive auctions. The thinking is clear that any company getting spectrum through govt allocation at a pre-determined price will need to pay tax on the spectrum,"" the source said.
Meanwhile, Vodafone Idea’s financial troubles persist. CEO Akshaya Moondra recently urged the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to allow the conversion of its upcoming AGR and spectrum purchase dues from the 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016 auctions into government equity. If approved, the government’s stake in Vodafone Idea could rise to 49% from the current 22.6%.

The telecom joint venture between the UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group has also told DoT that it does not have the financial capacity to provide a ₹6,091 crore bank guarantee or make a cash payment of ₹5,493 crore to cover a shortfall from the 2015 spectrum auction. The company has requested the DoT not to take “any coercive action” against it.
Moondra’s appeal follows the government’s decision to put a proposal to waive telcos'
AGR dues
on hold due to a lack of consensus within top government circles. This has dealt a fresh blow to Vodafone Idea, which was hoping for relief on its mounting dues.
With no reprieve on AGR payments, Vodafone Idea faces a sharp rise in regulatory payouts once the moratorium on such payments ends in September.
JM Financial
estimates that the company will have to pay ₹29,100 crore by March 2026. From FY27 onwards, its annual regulatory payments are projected to increase further, reaching an estimated ₹43,000 crore per year until FY31.
At the end of December, Vodafone Idea’s AGR dues stood at ₹70,000 crore, while its cash reserves were at a modest ₹12,090 crore.

Trai starts talks with broadcasters for overhauling regulatory system,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-starts-talks-with-broadcasters-for-overhauling-regulatory-system/articleshow/119175555.cms,22-03-2025,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(TRAI) has initiated discussions with broadcasting industry stakeholders as part of its efforts to overhaul the sector’s regulatory framework, said people directly aware of the matter.
The regulator is preparing a consultation paper aimed at conducting a holistic review of existing regulations, they added.
On Tuesday, TRAI held a meeting with television broadcasters, including representatives from the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation and the News Broadcasters and Digital Association, to discuss key issues that could be addressed in the upcoming consultation process.
The meeting focused on identifying challenges and areas requiring reform within the current regulatory landscape. Stakeholders have been requested to submit their concerns and suggestions by April 5 for consideration in the consultation process.
According to sources familiar with the matter, the consultation paper will lay the foundation for a more balanced regulatory framework. Tuesday’s meeting marks the first in a series of discussions aimed at ensuring inclusivity in the decision-making process, they said.
Live Events
TRAI also plans to engage further with industry representatives to develop policies that align with evolving market dynamics. It is scheduled to meet with distribution platform operators (DPOs) on Wednesday to understand their concerns and gather additional insights.
TRAI appears to be leaning towards deregulating the broadcasting sector to enhance its competitiveness against digital platforms, particularly over-the-top services, sources who attended Tuesday’s meeting said on the condition of anonymity.
Currently, channel pricing, carriage fees and the discounts offered by broadcasters to DPOs are subject to upper limits. The industry has been advocating for the removal of these restrictions to enable broadcasters and DPOs to conduct business more independently.
“Broadcasters pointed out that the industry is currently heavily regulated. If TRAI wants the sector to compete effectively with OTT platforms, the regulatory burden needs to be reduced,” said one of the officials present at the meeting.
During his address at the Ficci FRAMES 2024 event, TRAI chairman AK Lahoti reaffirmed the regulator’s commitment to fostering an orderly and transparent broadcasting industry. He emphasised the need to facilitate the entry of new players and emerging technologies while ensuring that existing businesses do not face undue challenges.
The broadcasting sector is currently undergoing significant upheaval due to rapid technological advancements and shifting consumer preferences. The rise of over-the-top platforms and DD Free Dish has had a profound impact on the pay-TV industry, with the number of subscribers falling to 84 million from 120 million in the last few years.
The broadcasting industry has been demanding a level playing field, arguing that television channels are heavily regulated, while OTT platforms and DD Free Dish face minimal regulatory oversight.

is likely to be subjected to a
spectrum usage charge
(SUC) in India, a levy that had been scrapped for terrestrial network providers such as Reliance Jio,

a few years ago, ToI reported citing sources. If imposed, the tax will increase costs for the Elon Musk-led satellite communications company in India.
The potential charge adds to the challenges Starlink is already facing as it negotiates strict compliance mandates related to internet suspension and interception.
Sources told ToI, Starlink, which is set to receive telecom airwaves through administrative allocation under the new telecom law passed in December 2023, may have to pay around 3% SUC on its adjusted gross revenue from the country.
""Since spectrum will be 'administratively assigned' to satellite operators instead of auction, SUC will be applicable, for which final rates are being worked upon,"" one of the sources said.
This means satcom players will have to pay SUC in addition to the 8% licence fee already applicable to all telecom companies. ""It may even be higher than 3%, though this is still being discussed.""

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is finalising the pricing, tenure, and taxation of satellite spectrum. ""Discussions within Trai are believed to have come to the conclusion that there is a requirement to mandate SUC for satcom players, since they will be allotted spectrum administratively at a pre-determined price,"" the source added.
Trai is expected to submit its recommendations on satcom spectrum allocation soon. These will be reviewed by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), which may seek further clarifications before referring the matter to the inter-ministerial Digital Communications Commission (DCC). Following DCC’s approval, the issue will be placed before the Cabinet.
In June 2022, the government decided to remove SUC for bandwidth auctioned after September 15, 2021, across various frequencies.
Sources said SUC would also apply to other satellite operators, including Eutelsat OneWeb, in which Airtel promoter

"TRAI plans to limit satellite permits to five years, defying Musk's Starlink",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-plans-to-limit-satellite-permits-to-five-years-defying-musks-starlink/articleshow/118968945.cms,13-03-2025,"India's telecom regulator plans to recommend that satellite broadband spectrum be allotted for around five years to assess initial market adoption, defying Elon Musk's Starlink, which is seeking a 20-year permit, said a senior government source.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on key recommendations to the federal government, including a time frame and pricing of satellite spectrum, which will be administratively allotted.
Musk and Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani forged a partnership this week that will allow Starlink devices to be sold in Ambani's
Reliance
stores, giving it large distribution access. They were rivals earlier - Ambani's telco subsidiary had unsuccessfully lobbied New Delhi for months to auction spectrum, and not allot it administratively as Musk wanted.
Starlink has pushed New Delhi to allot spectrum for 20 years to focus on ""affordable pricing and longer-term business plans"", while Reliance sought it for three years, after which it wants India to reassess the market, according to their public submissions.
Another Indian telco,
Bharti Airtel
, has also pushed for a 3-5 year period for the licence. Airtel and Musk have also signed a distribution deal for Starlink, like Ambani's Reliance.
Live Events
TRAI plans to agree to demands for a lower licence time-frame ""of around 5 years and then see how the sector grows,"" said the senior government source, who declined to be named as the decision-making process is confidential.
""This will help understand how the market stabilises, so there's no point going beyond five years,"" said the official.
An industry source familiar with licensing processes said the shorter time-frame will allow New Delhi to revise spectrum prices after five years as the market develops.
TRAI did not respond to Reuters queries. Airtel, Reliance and Starlink also did not immediately respond.
The government source added it will take about a month for the TRAI to finalise its recommendations on the licence time- frame and a per megahertz spectrum pricing, which will then be submitted to India's telecoms ministry for further action.
Musk's deals with Reliance and Airtel are subject to Starlink winning pending regulatory clearances in India, but came weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Musk in Washington, where they discussed issues including space, mobility, technology and innovation.
Ambani has been worried that his telecom company, which spent $19 billion in airwave auctions, risks losing broadband customers to Starlink and potentially even data and voice clients later.
The satellite spectrum pricing ""will be substantially lower"" than traditional telecom licences, which are granted via auction for 20 years, the government official added.
KPMG estimates India’s satellite communication sector will grow more than 10 times in size to touch $25 billion by 2028.

The law simplifies the prevalent licensing regime for telecom service providers by reducing regulatory burdens with an aim to lower entry barriers for new players, start-ups and small-and-medium enterprises.
“The material provisions dealing with authorisations, which have the potential to significantly improve the existing licensing framework, and several disputed areas, remain to be notified,” Arun Prabhu, Partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas said.
The Trai consultation on these, along with attendant recommendations, according to Prabhu, are starting to emerge, and if these recommendations are expeditiously adopted, and rules notified, the process may move towards completion.
On June 21, 2024, the Ministry of Communications, notified Sections 1, 2, 10 to 30, 42 to 44, 46, 47, 50 to 58, 61 and 62 of the Telecommunications Act 2023, making them effective from June 26, 2024.

The mandatory testing and certification of telecommunication equipment scheme was launched in 2019. The primary aim of the scheme was to ensure that any telecom equipment does not degrade performance of existing network, protection of users and that the telecom equipment complies with the relevant national and international regulatory standards.
The scheme was implemented in different phases with different sets of equipment taken into the mandate under each phase. The government has now notified products that will be included in phase 5 of the scheme, including satellite communications equipment.
The nascent satcom industry is set to move to newer heights in coming years with the likes of Eutelsat-OneWeb, Starlink, Jio's joint venture with Luxembourg-based satellite provider SES and Amazon Kuiper, vying to capture the market.
A fierce battle is playing out with Starlink and Amazon Kuiper on one side--who want spectrum allocation without auctions-and private telecom operators on the other. The telcos-Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea--are seeking allocation of airwaves to the highest bidder.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is expected to soon provide details around pricing of satcom spectrum. At stake is a share of the country's space economy that has the potential to hit $44 billion by 2033, and account for about 8% of the global share, from 2% now, according to space regulator IN-SPACe.
Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio-SES combine have already got GMPCS licences besides approvals from IN-SPACe. Starlink and Amazon have got neither so far.

satellite communications
sector as it prepares to decide on a licence and spectrum allocation for
Elon Musk
’s
Starlink
, ToI reported. The companies have called for “comparable”
spectrum pricing
for satellite operators to prevent what they term as “market distortions.”
In a petition to the government, the telecom firms have accused the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) of not addressing the competitive imbalance between satellite and terrestrial spectrum allocation. “Comparable spectrum pricing to terrestrial services should be enforced for competing satellite services in urban/semi-urban/rural areas for retail/enterprise customers,” the representation said. It argues that satellite operators providing similar services must comply with the same pricing, regulatory levies, and fees as terrestrial telecom providers.
The new telecom law passed in December 2023 allows
satellite spectrum
to be assigned administratively for a fee, unlike terrestrial spectrum, which is auctioned. However, the specifics of pricing and allocation are still being worked out by Trai.
Jio and
Airtel
have raised concerns over low-earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations, arguing that their broadband speeds and capacity are comparable to those of terrestrial networks. “Given the oversupply of broadband capacity that these entities are bringing to market, they will distort competition of terrestrial broadband, especially in urban/semi-urban areas serving retail/enterprise customers,” the petition stated.
The telecom firms acknowledged that satellite spectrum should be assigned administratively at lower prices for specific non-competing uses, such as government functions, disaster recovery, cellular backhaul, and sectors like defence, maritime, and aviation. However, they insist that commercial satellite operators should not receive preferential pricing.

Despite industry concerns, the government has remained firm in its decision to assign satellite spectrum without auctions. Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has defended this approach, citing technological differences between terrestrial and satellite-based networks. “As far as terrestrial networks are concerned, you can allocate frequencies exclusively, which can’t be used by others… but satellite spectrum is shared. How do you auction something that’s shared? You can’t,” he said.
Meanwhile, Starlink’s application for a satcom licence remains under review, pending security clearances. Company representatives have been engaging with the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Home Affairs as the process nears its final stages, ToI reported citing sources.

and
Bharti Airtel
are urging the government to create a level-playing field while framing the new
spectrum surrender policy
instead of one that benefits a single telecom operator, said people aware of the details.
India's top two telcos expressed their views during a recent meeting with
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) officials to discuss the proposal of surrendering spectrum acquired before 2022.
While the spectrum surrender policy, if approved, will be applicable to all telcos,
Vodafone Idea
(Vi) stands to benefit the most as it can return a significant quantum of airwaves and reduce its annual instalments.
Jio doesn't have much excess airwaves and has also cleared ahead of time most of its payments for past spectrum purchases. Airtel, though, has some excess airwaves in bands like 2100 MHz in a few circles that can be returned. The Sunil Mittal-led telco too has been making advance payments for most of its previous bandwidth purchases.
""Surrender of spectrum is absolutely the right way forward because you are sitting with a scarce resource and if you are not using it, it should be surrendered and the same can be auctioned. We have been supportive of that,"" said an executive at one of the telcos cited above.

However, the policy should be such that it benefits all the players equally and not one firm, Jio and Airtel executives told DoT officials at the meeting, the people said.
All the telcos obtained spectrum through auctions, paying the same market price but opting for varied payment options. ""Since allowing surrender of spectrum before 2022 auctions would be termed as amending the notice inviting application (NIA), the changes should be done in a way that is fine with all telcos,"" another executive said.
Jio, Airtel and Vi did not respond to queries.
ET reported on February 26 about DoT's plan to consider surrender of spectrum acquired in auctions before 2022. The move will allow Vi to save an estimated around Rs 40,000 crore. The actual savings will, however, depend on the quantum of spectrum the company plans to surrender.
Vi's dues to the government from spectrum purchases amount to ₹1.57 lakh crore, most of it for airwaves acquired before 2022. The telco has 8,030 MHz of spectrum across several bands and says it has the most airwaves per million subscribers in the industry.
The latest proposal is part of measures the government has taken or is considering to underline its intent of ensuring a competitive telecom sector with three healthy competitors-Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea-along with state-run

TRAI proposes broadcast fee overhaul under new authorisation regime,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-proposes-broadcast-fee-overhaul-under-new-authorisation-regime/articleshow/118457754.cms,21-02-2025,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
TRAI
) has recommended reducing authorisation fees and bank guarantees for certain broadcasting distribution services while reiterating its earlier recommendation to phase out direct-to-home (DTH) licence fees by the end of FY27.
These recommendations to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (
MIB
) form part of the consultation process on the Framework for Service Authorisations for the Provision of
Broadcasting Services
under the
Telecommunications Act, 2023
.
As part of this process, the regulator has also proposed transitioning the broadcasting industry from a licencing regime to an authorisation-based system.
Under the current guidelines, licences, permissions, and registrations for various broadcasting services are issued by the MIB under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, covering TV channels, DTH, HITS, and cable TV services.
However, with the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, now repealed and replaced by the Telecommunications Act, 2023, Section 3(1)(a) of the new Act mandates authorisation for broadcasting services, subject to prescribed terms, conditions, and fees.
Live Events
Key recommendations include reducing the DTH authorisation fee to 3% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), with a gradual reduction to zero by the end of FY27.
The authority has also suggested that the MIB consider bringing multi-system operator (MSO) and local cable operator (LCO) registrations under the purview of the Telecommunications Act, 2023. The TRAI noted that the provisions related to registration under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, may be repealed, while content regulation of broadcasting services will continue to be governed by that Act.
The regulator also observed that the question of whether over-the-top (OTT) platforms should be brought under the
authorisation framework
requires further examination through a separate consultation process. During the consultation process, stakeholders reiterated that OTT platforms should be included in the authorisation framework to ensure parity with other broadcasting services.
Additionally, the TRAI has recommended removing the minimum net worth requirement of Rs 100 crore for internet service providers (ISPs) offering IPTV services, aligning it with the provisions of internet service authorisation under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).
For Headend-in-the-Sky (HITS) services, the TRAI has recommended reducing the bank guarantee from the current Rs 40 crore for the initial three years to Rs 5 crore for the entire validity period. Another key recommendation is extending the validity period of authorisations from 10 years to 20 years.
The TRAI has also proposed that the authorisation fee for radio broadcasting should be 4% of AGR for all cities and 2% for the North East, Jammu & Kashmir, and island territories. Currently, the annual fee for radio is either 4% of gross revenue (GR) or 2.5% of the Non-Refundable One-Time Entry Fee (NOTEF), whichever is higher, for all cities. For the North East, Jammu & Kashmir, and island territories, the annual fee was 2% of GR or 1.25% of NOTEF for the first three years, after which it aligned with other cities.
Based on stakeholder feedback, the TRAI has also suggested bringing Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television (FAST) service providers under the authorisation framework through a separate consultation process. The regulator stated that the MIB may consider a distinct authorisation category for FAST channels under television channel distribution services. The TRAI said it would provide detailed conditions for FAST service authorisations once it receives a reference from the MIB.
The migration of existing licensees or permission holders to the new authorisation regime will be voluntary until their current licences or permissions expire. No processing fee or entry fee will be required for migration in the case of broadcasting services. However, the validity period of the new service authorisation will commence from the effective date of migration, regardless of the remaining validity of the existing licence or permission.
The regulator has also recommended that television distribution platforms should strive to adopt interoperable set-top boxes (STBs), enabling consumers to switch service providers without changing their STB. This initiative aims to enhance consumer choice and reduce electronic waste. The Telecommunication Engineering Centre (TEC) will establish and notify standards for interoperable STBs and television sets with built-in STB functionality.
On 25 July 2024, the MIB sent a letter to the TRAI seeking recommendations on the authorisation process for broadcasting services, aligning it with the Telecommunications Act, 2023, and harmonising terms and conditions across various service providers.
The TRAI has recommended that broadcasting service authorisations be granted under Section 3(1)(a) of the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replacing the current practice of issuing licences and permissions under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. The terms and conditions for service authorisations will be notified as rules under Section 56 of the Telecommunications Act, 2023.
To safeguard the interests of service providers, the TRAI has recommended that amendments to service authorisation terms and conditions—except in matters of national security—should require TRAI’s recommendations.
The regulator has also recommended voluntary infrastructure sharing among broadcasting service providers and with telecom service providers or infrastructure providers, wherever technically and commercially feasible.
Finally, the TRAI has proposed making the terms and conditions for radio broadcasting service technology agnostic, facilitating the adoption of digital technology. The MIB should also establish separate programme and advertisement codes for radio broadcasting service providers.

inter-operable set-top boxes
, voluntary sharing of infrastructure among broadcasters and slashing the minimum
net worth
requirement for
IPTV service providers
.
TRAI
, which is also the regulator for the broadcasting sector, released its recommendations on the Framework for Service Authorisations for the provision of
Broadcasting Services
under the Telecommunications Act-2023 which replaced the Telegraph Act, 1885.
The recommendations aim to promote growth and enhance
ease of doing business
in the broadcasting sector, the regulator said.
TRAI said broadcasting service authorisations shall be granted under Section 3(1)(a) of the Telecommunications Act, 2023, in place of the extant practice of issuing license/permission under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.
It has recommended
infrastructure sharing
, on a voluntary basis, among broadcasting service providers as well as with telecom service providers/infrastructure providers, wherever technically and commercially feasible.
""Authorised entities of '
Television Channel Distribution
Services' shall endeavour to adopt interoperable set-top boxes (STBs) to enhance consumer choice and reduce electronic waste,"" the set of recommendations said.
Live Events
It has also suggested preparation and notification of standards for interoperable STBs and television sets with inbuilt STB functionality.
""The minimum net worth requirement of Rs 100 crore for Internet Service Providers to provide IPTV Service is recommended to be removed and the same should be aligned with the provisions contained in the authorisation for Internet Services to be issued by DoT,"" the TRAI said.
It said that terms and conditions for
Radio Broadcasting Service
have been made technology agnostic enabling the adoption of digital technology.
TRAI said service authorisation for 'Terrestrial Radio Service' be delinked from frequency assignment and the auction of spectrum for frequency assignment for Terrestrial Radio Service shall be done separately.
In addition to the broadcasting of radio channel(s), the authorised entities for Terrestrial Radio Service should be allowed to stream the same content through the internet concurrently without any user control.
TRAI also asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to prescribe separate programme code and advertisement code for radio broadcasting service providers.

"To check spam, Trai plans to regulate telemarketers",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/to-check-spam-trai-plans-to-regulate-telemarketers/articleshow/118338124.cms,18-02-2025,"New Delhi: The telecom regulator will soon come out with a consultation paper on prescribing a
regulatory framework for telemarketers
, officials said.
The move may prove crucial for checking pesky calls and messages, which are at the heart of most instances of financial fraud, as the existing regulations to curb spam targeted at telecom operators have had little impact.
The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
's (Trai) plan follows strong criticism by
Reliance Jio
,
Bharti Airtel
and
Vodafone Idea
that argued that main stakeholders like telemarketers and OTT players have been kept out of the ambit of its latest regulations to check spam. Telcos are mere providers of infrastructure but have been burdened with additional compliance and costs, they said.
Trai officials told ET that all issues raised by operators will be analysed and in the consultation paper, and viewpoints of all stakeholders, including telcos, telemarketers and principal entities will be taken into consideration.
Live Events
""We will come out with the consultation paper soon and all the points will be discussed in detail,"" an official said. While the telemarketers and principal entities like banks, financial institutions, etc. will be held accountable, there was no clarity if the over-the-top (OTT) players like WhatsApp and Telegram too-whose platforms are increasingly used for spam resulting in financial fraud-will be covered in the framework.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has already written to Trai to prescribe a regulatory or authorisation framework for telemarketers.
One of the Trai officials cited above said the new consultation paper is being worked upon based on the key concerns raised by telcos recently. ""It is not that their issues won't be factored into. So far, we have come out with some norms to check spam, and more will be done in future, when we come out with the authorization for telemarketers,"" the official said.
Telcos, too, can submit their concerns to Trai, and they will be provided with answers, the person said.
In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day, taking the total to about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.
The regulator has been issuing various directives to telcos to curb spam and phishing. But despite that and the efforts of various government departments, the menace rages unchecked. In its bid to check spam, Trai recently amended the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR).
Holding telecom firms accountable, the regulator has prescribed financial penalties ranging from ₹2 lakh to ₹10 lakh for repeated violations in cases where telecom operators misreport the counts of pesky calls and messages.
These financial penalties will be in addition to the fines imposed on telecom operators against invalid closure of complaints, and not fulfilling their obligations in respect of registration of message headers and content templates.
The amended regulations, however, only cover communications received through telecom networks. Messages and calls through OTT apps such as WhatsApp are not covered. This was a key demand from stakeholders during the open house consultation before the release of the amended regulations.
Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents all three private telcos, on Monday said a more comprehensive approach is required to tackle spams effectively. ""In the current digital landscape, both OTT communication providers and telemarketers have become major stakeholders in messaging, and thus, it would be critical to establish a regulatory framework to ensure accountability from all stakeholders in the ecosystem, including OTT platforms and telemarketers/principal entities,"" COAI director general SP Kochhar said in a statement.
According to the association, both OTT communication providers and telemarketers have become major stakeholders in messaging, and it has become crucial to establish a regulatory framework to ensure accountability from all stakeholders in the ecosystem.
""...further, the second amendment does not bring OTT communication service providers under the ambit of this regulation, nor does it address the UCC issues at its source,"" Kochhar said in the statement.
""It is also concerning that the authority has substantially increased the penalty to be imposed over the TSPs (telecom service providers)... If at all these penalties are required, it should be directed to TM-D or the PEs who are actual originators and beneficiaries of the commercial communications,"" he added.
""Another important aspect was to reduce subjectivity from the regulation as well as compliances, which are based on the relationship between Principal Entities and their consumers, which has not been addressed,"" Kochhar said.

"TRAI recommends bringing teleport operators, IXPs under authorisation regime",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-recommends-bringing-teleport-operators-ixps-under-authorisation-regime/articleshow/118337940.cms,18-02-2025,"New Delhi: The telecom regulator has recommended that new telecom entities such as satellite earth station gateway, or teleport, providers and
internet exchanges
be regulated under the
authorisation regime
that it has already proposed for replacing the licensing regime.
In its recommendations published on Monday, the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
TRAI
) said cloud-hosted networks and
mobile number portability
providers (MNPs) should also be brought under separate authorisation categories.
The regulator said its recommendations are aimed at fostering growth and enhancing
ease of doing business
in the telecom sector.
Notably, content delivery networks and over-the-top players have been kept outside the new regulatory requirement. Telecom companies had been battling hard to bring them under regulation.
Operating ground-station-as-a-service for satcom operations and providing in-building connectivity solutions for terrestrial networks have also been exempt from seeking authorisations, as per the recommendations.
Live Events
This is also the first time that TRAI has suggested to introduce a new category for captive non-public networks for enterprises. In case the telecom department accepts the suggestion, TRAI said it may float a separate consultation paper.
TRAI also underlined the need for introducing authorisation for landing international undersea cables.
The application processing fees for all the said entities have been set at Rs 10,000. In case of MNPs, the authority has suggested an entry fee of Rs 40 lakh, bank guarantee of Rs 50 lakh and an authorisation fee equal to 1% of company’s adjusted gross revenue.
These recommendations come after TRAI held consultations with stakeholders on a proposal to overhaul the existing
telecom licensing regime
and bring in a pan-India single licence or
Unified Services Authorisation
(National) to enable ease of doing business, simplify regulations, cut costs and reduce litigations among other changes.
The simplification as per the Telecommunications Act 2023 marks the first significant change in the licensing regime in 30 years.

"TRAI's pesky call norms: COAI rues higher fines for telcos, flags lack of rules for OTT comms",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trais-pesky-call-norms-coai-rues-higher-fines-for-telcos-flags-lack-of-rules-for-ott-comms/articleshow/118327293.cms,17-02-2025,"COAI on Monday expressed concerns that the sector regulator's new norms to tackle
spam calls
and messages have prescribed substantially increased penalties for telcos, and rued the absence of any regulation for
OTT Communication Services
that, the industry body pointed out, has seen an influx of spam. Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI) contended that while
telecom operators
have taken ample steps to curb spam calls and messages, there has been a significant increase in the quantum of unsolicited communications as well as legitimate commercial communication, that has moved to OTT communication apps, substantially leading to the rise in financial crimes in the country, COAI Director General S P Kochhar said.
COAI said it is also concerning that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
TRAI
) has substantially increased the penalty to be imposed over the telecom service providers.
""COAI had submitted that Financial Disincentives (FDs) on TSPs, being only intermediary in this process, do not serve any purpose and have failed to address the issue in TRAI's all attempts to curb UCC (
Unsolicited Commercial Communication
). Instead, if at all these penalties are required, it should be directed to TM-D or the principal entities who are actual originators and beneficiaries of the commercial communications,"" the association of telcos, said.
COAI aired disappointment that TRAI's amendment of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018 to strengthen consumer protection against Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC), has been issued without addressing all relevant issues.
One of the most important demands of the TSPs was that this amendment should be released only after the delivery telemarketers are brought under regulation to manage unlawful communication.
Live Events
Citing information in public domain that DoT has already sought TRAI's inputs on the authorisation of telemarketers, COAI said it had submitted to the regulator that the only feasible and optimal approach to handling UCC can be by bringing telemarketers under the licensing regime.
Doing so would also establish that the government and the TRAI have legal control over entities responsible for sending such communications, in compliance with TCCCPR-2018, it argued.
Calling for ""a more comprehensive approach"" to tackle the issue effectively, COAI said in the current digital landscape, both OTT communication providers and telemarketers have become major stakeholders in messaging, and thus, it would be critical to establish a regulatory framework to ensure accountability from all stakeholders in the ecosystem, including OTT platforms and telemarketers/principal entities.
COAI expressed concerns that the latest amendments did not bring OTT Communication Service Providers under the ambit of this regulation, nor does it address the UCC issues at its source.
""While the TSPs have taken ample steps to curb spam calls and messages, there has been a significant increase in the quantum of unsolicited communications as well as legitimate commercial communication, that has moved to OTT communication apps, substantially leading to the rise in financial crimes in the country,"" as per COAI.
TRAI, it said, should take into consideration COAI's key submission and bring these entities under the ambit of its regulation, ""as it would make no sense to regulate one section of the traffic (TSPs) while the other section (OTT Communication Services) has no regulations at all"".
Another important aspect is to reduce subjectivity from the regulation as well as compliances, which are based on relationship between principal entities and their consumers, which has not been addressed.
""Since operators have made all the efforts that have considerably reduced their UCC complaints to a very low level, we were of the view that the telecom operators should not be penalised for unwarranted actions of some other subscribers,"" COAI added.
Telecom regulator, last week, intensified its crackdown on pesky calls and messages with new rules that prescribe fines ranging from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh for recurring and repeated instances of violation, in cases where telcos misreport the count of such spams. The regulator has mandated all telecom operators to analyse call and SMS patterns based on parameters such as unusually high call volumes, short call durations, and low incoming-to-outgoing call ratios to flag potential spammers in real-time.
TRAI has given more power to subscribers for filing complaints against pesky callers and spammers. Once the new norms are rolled out, subscribers will get 7 days to report about pesky calls and sms instead of the three days limit at present.
Telecom subscribers will also not need to register under DND (Do Not Disturb) list for making complaints against unregistered pesky callers, means those who call from phone numbers that do not start with prefix like 140 and 160. Consumers even will have the choice to opt out of promotional messages sent by their service providers.

Trai recommends new numbering system for landline users,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-recommends-new-numbering-system-for-landline-users/articleshow/117988903.cms,06-02-2025,"Fixed line users will need to dial an entire
10-digit number
even for local calls if the recommendation of telecom regulator Trai issued on Thursday is accepted by the government. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has recommended a
new numbering system
to end the STD code system for freeing up unused phone numbers. The new number system code would be at a telecom circle or state level.
The regulator has recommended ""migration from the existing SDCA-based (STD number based) numbering scheme to an LSA (licenced service area) based 10-digit closed numbering scheme for fixed-line services"" to effectively mitigate telecom identifier (TI) resource or the phone number constraints in the long run for
fixed-line services
with minimal disruption.
A telecom circle or licenced service area (LSA) generally refers to a state-level area or large metropolitan area.
Trai recommended that to implement the LSA-based 10-digit closed numbering scheme for fixed-line service subscribers will have to dial all fixed-line to fixed-line calls using a prefix of '0', followed by the SDCA (Short Distance Charging Area) or STD code and the subscriber's number.
""Even local calls within the same SDCA are to be dialled using a prefix of '0', followed by the SDCA code and the subscriber number,"" the regulator recommended.
Live Events
According to the recommendation, there should be no change in the existing phone numbers issued to subscribers.
Trai said that the Department of Telecom should give six months to
telecom operators
to implement the new numbering scheme.
For utilising numbers of deactivated, the Trai has recommended that no mobile or fixed-line connections shall be deactivated by the telecom operators until 90 days of the non-usage period expires.
It has suggested that all mobile and fixed-line connections that remain inactive due to non-usage shall be mandatorily deactivated by the TSPs after 365 days post-expiration of 90 days of the nonusage period.
Trai recommended that no mobile or fixed-line connections deactivated due to nonusage shall be reused by the service providers until the expiry of a minimum period of 90 days from the date of deactivation.
In case a a mobile or fixed-line connections has been deactivated/ disconnected for reasons other than non-usage such as surrender or disconnection by the customer or telecom operators then connections shall be reused by the telecom operators only after the expiry of a minimum period of 180 days from the date of deactivation or disconnection.
In the consultation paper, Trai was exploring the option of penalising or charging for allocation of number resources. The regulator in its recommendations has dropped these options.
""No additional charge or financial disincentive on numbering resources have been recommended at this stage,"" Trai recommended.
The regulator has said that the DoT should monitor the annual usage of numbering resources allocated to telecom operators and if required, may withdraw unutilised numbering resources.
Trai has reiterated that the DoT should expeditiously implement the caller name display system that it had recommended in February last year for both the regular telecom networks as well as IP-based calling system that are generally used by businesses for calling to their customers.

While Trai believes the new authorisation regime as recommended by it is much better than the existing licensing system, it will further provide its inputs to the DoT, a second official said.
The telcos had raised concerns over ending the contract system in the new regime, fearing it would lead to uncertainty. The DoT, however, is trying to allay the fears and make the new regime more friendly for all stakeholders.

As of now, the DoT is not looking to force the authorisation regime on telcos through a mandate, but it wants that all the stakeholders should voluntarily migrate to the new system in a time-bound manner.
The DoT believes that the existence of two systems – authorisation and licensing – will create confusion, leaving room for potential litigation.
Officials said the DoT also knows that forcing the telcos through a mandate to adopt the new regime might lead to legal challenges as the tenure of licences can’t be cut short. “The licence is a legal document, and telcos can challenge the DoT in case of cancellation or mandatory migration to the new regime,” the first official said.
The official added that the DoT does not want to force or fight with the industry and that it would rather encourage the players to opt for the new regime at the earliest, based on the benefits.
All telecom firms are currently following the licensing regime and Trai chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti had clarified last year that these firms can continue providing services under the licensing regime if they want to until the validity of their respective licences. However, they won’t be allowed to renew the licence on expiry and must mandatorily opt for the authorisation mechanism.
In the new regime, a company will be authorised to offer services while terms and conditions would be notified separately under the Telecommunications Act. The structure is different from the current regime wherein there is a contract between the DoT and a telecom firm, and all the rules and regulations are part of the contract.
The telcos had expressed unhappiness over the authorisation proposal, fearing that such a move would ring in regulatory uncertainty and undermine investor confidence.
As per the telcos, when an operator gets a licence, all terms and conditions are specified, which allows them to plan their future roadmap. So, even if the government wishes to change certain terms and conditions, it cannot do so unilaterally, and a notice must be given to the telcos first. But this safeguard may be missing in the new regime, and the government may unilaterally change the conditions, operators fear.
The government has tried to allay such apprehensions and assured the companies that proper safeguards will be in place, but it has not agreed to the telcos’ demand of continuing with the contract system.

Budget 2025: Customs duty cut on ethernet switches to boost rural and home Broadband Expansion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/budget-2025-indias-telecom-sector-to-benefit-from-50-cut-in-customs-duty-on-ethernet-switches/articleshow/117824457.cms,01-02-2025,"Home and
rural broadband
rollouts and expansions are likely to get a tad cheaper with the FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s proposal to halve the basic customs duty (BCD) on carrier-grade
Ethernet switches
to 10% in
Budget 2025
, telecom industry executives and sector analysts said.
They added that data centre buildout costs for the likes of
Reliance Jio
, Adani Group, Google and Facebook and Microsoft among others could also see some reduction as carrier-grade Ethernet switches are used in setting up data centres. Such Ethernet switches are used to connect servers in data centres
.
“The reduction in customs duty from 20% to 10% for carrier-grade ethernet switches aims to reduce costs for telecom infrastructure development at the enterprise scale, and this will reduce deployment costs for rural and home broadband,” Vinish Bawa, partner and telecom leader at PwC India said.
Analysts, though, said national rural broadband venture,
BharatNet
, could also be a key beneficiary as its expansion plans in providing last mile connectivity could get cheaper, going forward.
Carrier grade Ethernet switches are, typically, used in providing last mile connectivity for rural and home broadband ventures.
Live Events
The latest Economic Survey for 2024-25, had noted that India’s telecoms infrastructure is being bolstered via the national rural broadband venture, BharatNet.
“As of December 2024, 6.92 lakh km of Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) has been laid, 2.14 lakh gram panchayats (GPs) are service-ready (including 5,032 via satellite, 12.04 lakh FTTH connections have been installed).
Sitharaman said the proposal to halve the BCD on carrier-grade Ethernet switches is to bring it on par with non-carrier grade Ethernet switches.

Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal stays Trai penalties on telcos over spam menace,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telecom-disputes-settlement-appellate-tribunal-stays-trai-penalties-on-telcos-over-spam-menace/articleshow/117753387.cms,31-01-2025,"New Delhi: The Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal (
TDSAT
) has stayed the telecommunications regulator's levy of
financial penalties
totalling more than '141 crore on
Reliance Jio
,
Bharti Airtel
and
Vodafone Idea
for not being able to curb spam.
In its order, the TDSAT restrained the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) from taking any coercive action against the
telecom operators
till the next hearing, scheduled for February 13.
The telcos had challenged Trai's penalties, arguing that the regulator should not have levied the penalties when an anti-spam platform was still in the process of development. The regulator, however, said operators should respect and comply with its orders, including payment of fines.
The three private telcos had individually challenged Trai's penalties, and the petitions were heard together. State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) had not challenged the regulator, despite being levied the highest amount of fine. But in the wake of the TDSAT order, Trai is unlikely to take any action against
BSNL
as well.
The TDSAT, in its order dated January 28, said there have been allegations and counter-allegations from both sides. For instance, the telcos have submitted that at the time when Trai imposed the penalties, the digital consent acquisition (DCA) platform was still being deployed.
Live Events
Trai is said to have acknowledged that there were an initial hitch and teething problems with the implementation of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (TCCCPR) and that the delays in implementation were caused due to Covid as well, the order said. ET has seen a copy of the order.
Telecom firms were not responsible for the delay in implementation of the regulations, including the DCA, the tribunal observed, adding: ""Thus, it is unfair and arbitrary on the part of the respondent to impose financial disincentives on the appellants (telcos) for something which was beyond their control.""
Before challenging Trai's order, the telcos had asked Trai officials to waive of penalties during the Covid period and offered to pay the rest, said an industry executive familiar with the matter. ""But Trai did not agree to their demand.""
While the regulator has been imposing penalties on telcos, it has not realised any money as operators contended that they should not be held accountable for something which they don't control or perpetuate.

Spoofed Calls: Indian government combats phone scams,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/spoofed-calls-indian-government-combats-phone-scams/articleshow/117393620.cms,20-01-2025,"The
Indian government
is fighting back against phone fraud, which has significantly impacted the country. The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) and
telecom companies
implemented the ""International Incoming
Spoofed Calls Prevention
System."" This system initially blocked 70% of spoofed calls, reducing the volume from 1.5 crore (15 million) calls daily to around 5 lakh (500,000).
However, scammers adapted by using virtual private networks (VPNs) to disguise their location, making some Indian calls appear international. The DoT is now working with international long-distance operators and exploring
AI solutions
to address this new challenge. “This is a more complex problem that requires a multi-pronged solution. There is no mathematical formula to block all calls with international numbers so there may be some cost attached,” an official stated.
Authorities are also using other methods to combat phone fraud. A
facial recognition
and AI tool called ASTR has identified 7.8 million
fraudulent SIM cards
registered under different names by the same person. This led to 365 legal cases against 1,900 points of sale violating regulations.
Furthermore, an analysis of 690,000 Indian mobile users roaming in Southeast Asia since July 2024 revealed suspected fraudulent activity. As a result, roughly 200,000 connections and 9,828 handsets were blocked. Information sharing is also being enhanced via the Digital Intelligence Platform, which connects 520 entities, including security agencies, police, banks, telecom companies, and platforms like

""Having digital connectivity alone does not translate into the outcomes rather how technology is made to work for the people is more crucial. Here India has again led in the form of
digital public infrastructure
under the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile) trinity, which has accelerated the process of financial inclusivity,"" he said.
India's digital public infrastructure (DPI) has seen tremendous traction worldwide with as many as 12 countries deploying it, according to a Ministry of External Affairs official.
The official said digital payments enabled through digital connectivity and real-time user identification have reduced the cost of transactions, increased transparency and reduced misappropriation. It has paved the way for a new open architecture and interactive business models such as open network for digital commerce.

DoT gets cabinet nod to refarm 1100 MHz spectrum across bands,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-gets-cabinet-nod-to-refarm-1100-mhz-spectrum-across-bands/articleshow/117309438.cms,17-01-2025,"The Union cabinet on Thursday approved the plan of the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) to refarm or reuse nearly 1100 MHz spectrum across several bands, which could be worth around Rs 5 lakh crore and can be sold in auctions in the next few years.
The
spectrum refarming
exercise has been undertaken to meet the requirements of telecom operators for their 5G, and later 6G, services, said officials aware of the matter,
ET had reported on November 28 edition about the DoT’s plans to refarm the spectrum that is currently being utilised by different ministries and government departments.
The cabinet nod follows approval from the committee of secretaries (CoS), which has already given a go-ahead to the refarming exercise. Last year, the Union cabinet had approved setting up of a CoS to work on spectrum refarming. The panel comprises various departmental secretaries and senior DoT officers. The chairman of the CoS was allowed to take assistance from external experts, if required.
The refarming exercise includes spectrum across 10 bands ranging from 470 MHz to 6 GHz. Spectrum across these bands including mid-band and some portion of 6 GHz is currently being utilised by the ministries of space, defence, information and broadcasting, railways and housing and urban affairs.
Live Events
Mid-band ranges from 1000 MHz (1 GHz)-6000 MHz (6 GHz), with 3500 MHz-6000 MHz best suited for 4G and
5G services
.
The DoT has not given any valuation for the spectrum as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) suggests the pricing. Several bands will be auctioned for the first time, while others were auctioned a few years ago, requiring the need for new price discovery through auction.
Officials estimate the value of the airwaves at about Rs 5 lakh crore based on the winning bids for other bands in previous auctions.
The cabinet decision has cleared the way to auction the upper portion of
6 GHz spectrum
for mobility services. The telecom industry has been seeking the entire 1200 MHz spectrum in the 6 GHz band for 5G and 6G services. As per the industry, it would need about 2,000 MHz in the mid-band range in the next few years. But currently, only 400 MHz is available in the mid-band.
As per the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the available mid-band spectrum in the 6 GHz band (5925-7125 MHz), or 1,200 MHz of spectrum, has immense potential in international mobile telecommunications for commercial success and deployment of 5G and 6G in the future.
However, the DoT has yet to take a call on the entire 6 GHz band. As of now, certain quantum of the upper 6 GHz band will be offered for mobile services. The tech industry has been seeking delicensing of the 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi services.
The DoT, too, believes there is a need to provide more airwaves, especially in mid-band and some premium lower bands, for upgrading 5G technology and introducing 6G, which is expected to be launched by 2030. Most of the spectrum is currently being utilised by legacy users such as the armed forces and the space department, and it may be shifted to other frequencies.

Public Wi-Fi companies back Trai call to cap data rates under PM-WANI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/public-wi-fi-companies-back-trai-call-to-cap-data-rates-under-pm-wani/articleshow/117309221.cms,17-01-2025,"Public Wi-Fi
hotspot providers operating under the
PM-WANI scheme
have backed the
telecom regulator
’s recommendation for a price ceiling, but also called for more incentives to help them boost the proliferation of low-price internet.
The Prime Minister Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI) scheme is envisioned to democratise internet access and create 10 million public Wi-Fi hotspots by 2022, reaching 50 million by 2030. However, the scheme, launched in 2020, has had a muted impact on broadband proliferation, mainly due to resistance from telcos and
internet service providers
(ISPs).
On Wednesday, TRAI proposed capping
broadband connectivity
costs of Wi-Fi service providers or 'public data offices’ (PDOs) at twice the applicable rate for retail home broadband services.
“This will help us in seeking connectivity at nearly Rs 500-600 per month from ISPs instead of being forced to take leased line connections which were 40-80 times
costlier
,” said Vimal Yash Sahwal, a PDO aggregator who runs 100 access points in Uttar Pradesh.
Telecom operators
, however, say that the hitherto-unsuccessful public WiFi initiative is unlikely to succeed despite the move by the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(TRAI). The companies ET spoke with said the mobile
data rates
are already so low that people don’t need to access mobile Internet using these plans.
Live Events
Under the PM-WANI scheme, PDOs are usually housewives, tea sellers, photocopy shop owners and roadside food stalls who offer cheap data vouchers at Rs 5 to Rs 100. An average PDO makes Rs 700-1000 per month and will be able to sustain the business at the new ceiling price.
However, Sahwal said that lowering the price for PDOs alone cannot boost PM-WANI, which continues to have a poor response even after four years of its roll-out.
“The government should look at PM-WANI as a social scheme which needs support through incentives. ISPs (internet service providers) must get relaxation in fees and taxes on revenues earned through providing connectivity to PDOs,” Sahwal said, otherwise market forces will just look it from the lens of a business case. “Just like schemes like BharatNet and PLI, the government must also bring incentives for PDOs who have achieved sizeable scale.”
A telecom policy executive also noted that public Wi-Fi is unlikely to pick pace at a time when mobile data packs offer unlimited consumption at cheap prices.
“Notably, the average data usage per PM-WANI hotspot is lower (200 Mbps) than a FTTH home broadband connection (200-500 Mbps). This is because home users spend hours watching content, whereas public Wi-Fi consumption is transient. Passers-by will not spend hours at a tea stall watching content,” the person said.
Meanwhile, telcos and ISPs fear Wi-Fi providers, supported by big tech companies, can set up a parallel Wi-Fi network without any network and licence fee implications, hurting the business of ISPs and telcos.
“There have been instances when PDOs started installing Wi-Fi at places like shopping malls and made it a business,” a senior ISP executive said. “They had become an unlicensed reseller.”
Kunal Bajaj, CEO and co-founder of network services company CloudExtel, explained that public Wi-Fi hotspots also need fiber penetration, as wireless backhaul technologies like 5G, 4G or even on a microwave, will have low capacity.
“I believe the combination of PM-WANI and BharatNet has the potential to significantly boost broadband penetration and utilisation, especially in rural areas. Wi-Fi devices are a lot cheaper and Wi-Fi as a technology is a lot less expensive, therefore, you would definitely have wider levels of adoption,” Bajaj said.
As of July 22,
2024,
there were only 207,642 Wi-Fi hotspots, 199 PDO aggregators and 111 app providers across India, TRAI data showed.

6-Ghz band
could lead to a radio wave crunch for high-speed
5G services
, a key growth driver for the country's
digital economy
and development of emerging technologies specially artificial intelligence, industry body
COAI
said on Tuesday.
India needs an additional 2 giga hertz of
mid-band spectrum
to meet the international standard of 'IMT-2020' user experience to ensure data rates of 100 megabit per second (mbps) on downlink and 50 mbps on uplink in densely-populated cities, COAI Director General S P Kochhar told PTI, citing global telecom industry GSMA.
""While the government is considering vacating the spectrum in C-band, i.e., 3,670-4,000 MHz for 5G/6G use, it may not be enough to reach the required 2 GHz spectrum for IMT (5G/6G) in mid-band. Therefore, we want to stress on the fact that it is essential that the most optimal allocation of the 1,200 MHz available in the 6 GHz band is done for
mobile communications
in India, to get this critical 2 GHz of spectrum in mid-band,"" Kochhar said.
Wifi service providers have been demanding de-licensing of spectrum in 6 Ghz, which will make the wave useful for providing internet services.
The
Cellular Operators Association of India
(COAI), whose members include
Bharti Airtel
, Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea etc, has opposed delicensing of that spectrum.

""Delicensing of a spectrum which has a commercial value will incur loss to the national exchequer. We reiterate that the demand for delicensing the 6 GHz band for
Wi-Fi 7
technologies is unjustified as Wi-Fi 7 is spectrum-agnostic and therefore, can utilise other spectrum bands to provide better performance,"" Kochhar said.
The government has already de-licensed 605 MHz spectrum in the 5 GHz frequency band.
Kochhar said that the de-licensed radio waves still have not been effectively utilized as 255 MHz of this band remain unutilized.
He further said that wider and seamless mobile network coverage is required for the growth of the digital economy that is playing a pivotal role in job creation and making India globally competitive.
When asked about the practice of delicensing spectrum in 6Ghz band in several countries, Kochhar said that the 6Ghz band has been made free for use only in the regions that already have an extensive optical fibre cable network, whereas India does not have such a density of OFC to a large cross section of the population both in urban and rural areas.
""Moreover, Indian population density is more than all of these countries viz: with a population density of 464 people per square kilometres. India is at multiple times more than other countries like Canada (108x), Norway (32x), Saudi Arabia (29x), Brazil (18x), USA (13x), etc. All these countries have an extensive wireline/OFC infrastructure,"" he said.
The COAI DG said that many nations like US have realised that delicensing of spectrum is an irreversible process and hence any consideration for such a decision should be examined with diligent deliberation and detailed techno-economic analysis in India for assignment of any of the 5G spectrum, including the 6 GHz band is imperative.
Once the mid-band radiowave is exhausted, mobile phone service providers will get frequencies in higher bands in which signals cover less area. The cost of rolling out public telecom services increases in higher frequency ranges.
Kochhar said that the 6 GHz mid-band provides a balance of wide coverage and capacity, which is critical to the rapid and cost-efficient deployments of 5G mobile networks in India and also meets the exponentially increasing data demands, that too at affordable terms.
""This would maximize the economic and societal benefits for achieving the national target of 1 trillion digital economy. Further, it would also help meet the growing demand for 5G services and prepare for future technologies like 6G,"" Kochhar said.

Several states ready for centre's RoW rules for faster installation of mobile towers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/several-states-ready-for-centres-row-rules-for-faster-installation-of-mobile-towers/articleshow/117040415.cms,08-01-2025,"Several states have agreed to adopt the Centre’s right of way (RoW) rules, a development that will allow faster rollout of fibre and installation of mobile towers.
While some states and Union Territories (UTs) including Goa, Chandigarh and Arunachal Pradesh have onboarded the Centre’s
Gati Shakti Sanchar portal
, others such as Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi have expressed their intention to join, said officials.
It comes after a letter from the telecom secretary, Neeraj Mittal, in November last year to all states and UTs in the country to follow the RoW rules notified under the
Telecommunications Act
, specifying that there was no need to go through the adoption process.
Earlier, the RoW rules required adoption from each state and the charges levied by different states used to differ. But the new rules, which came into effect from January 1, have to be uniformly executed by all states, giving a boost to
telecom operators
and infrastructure providers in maintaining and installing telecom towers and laying optical fibre.
While the rules are framed by the Centre, the states have to adopt them, so that there is uniformity across the country. Getting RoW permissions and installing towers have been perennial problems for telcos, particularly in places such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, where there are multiple municipal corporations.

Telecom Right of Way rules must for states from January 1
For instance, in Delhi, NDMC, MCD and Delhi Cantonment Board used to have their own policies and rates pertaining to installation of telecom infra. But now the Delhi government has adopted the new RoW rules, allowing telcos to put up sites and lay fibre at uniform rates.
The new rules are expected to streamline the deployment of
telecom infrastructure
, facilitate faster rollout of 5G networks and be a game changer for the industry, said experts.
According to the
Digital Infrastructure
Providers Association, key highlights of the rules include introduction of a simplified process for obtaining RoW permissions, with clear timelines for public entities to respond to applications. The rules set maximum limits on various charges, ensuring predictability and affordability for telecom providers.
There are special provisions for the installation of small cells on street furniture, facilitating the densification of networks crucial for 5G and beyond.
The new rules also state that there won’t be any fee for establishing a temporary overground network.
The RoW rules will allow licensees to set up temporary overground telegraph infrastructure when their existing underground infrastructure is damaged, and no fees will be charged by the authorities for this.
The move will help restore telegraph services on priority, thus preventing major disruptions in services to the users, say experts.
All applications and communications will be processed through a digital portal, enhancing transparency and efficiency.

DoT seeks Trai clarity on bank guarantee encashment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-seeks-trai-clarity-on-bank-guarantee-encashment/articleshow/116893981.cms,03-01-2025,"New Delhi: The communications ministry has sought clarity from the telecom regulator on which licence clauses can be invoked to encash telcos' bank guarantees (BGs) to recover fines related to spam, or unsolicited communications.
A few months ago, in an unprecedented move, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) urged the government to encash
telecom operators
' BGs to recover penalties imposed for their failure to tackle spam effectively.
The ministry will decide its future action on the matter based on Trai's reply, an official privy to the details told ET. ""Since this is the first time that such a situation has arisen, we have to see how we can proceed on this issue,"" the official said.
Trai is yet to revert to the telecom department (DoT) on the clarification.
Another official said there is no specific clause in the licence on unsolicited commercial communications (UCC) or spam.

The telcos are bound to offer quality of services (QoS) as required by Trai regulations. But QoS is primarily meant to check network parameters, so that mobile consumers get good services and any discrepancy by the telcos in offering services can be challenged by the authorities.
Spam is related to consumer behaviour and there are many stakeholders in the ecosystem, so it's not entirely focused on telcos, the second official said.
While Trai has issued Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR) to check spam, there are no provisions in the licence wherein the DoT can penalise telcos.
""If DoT issues a notice to encash BGs of telcos for not curbing spam, it will certainly be challenged by the telcos as this is not in the rules,"" a third official said.
Since BGs are only encashed when companies are not able to make statutory payments due to financial constraints, such a development could affect the credit profile of telecom firms, experts said.
Trai has been imposing fines on telcos-totalling about ₹141 crore so far-for their failure to curb spam, but it had not realised any sum as operators contend that they should not be held accountable for something which they don't control or perpetuate.
Telcos have been engaged with Trai on the issue and what more can be done to get rid of the menace.
Since telemarketers are an important stakeholder in the entire ecosystem, the DoT has already asked Trai to bring such players in the regulatory fold.
Trai is likely to soon issue a consultation paper on the matter.
Once telemarketers are brought under some regulatory, or authorisation, framework, they can be held accountable for controlling spam along with telecom operators and will be liable to face consequences, experts said.
Currently, these entities are not under any regulations that would hold them responsible for the nuisance of pesky messages and calls, which are also at the heart of numerous instances of financial fraud.
As per current rules, Trai imposes penalties on telcos for
spam messages
and calls on their networks. Telcos have commercial binding agreements with telemarketers and, as per Trai, operators should recover the penalty amount from telemarketers. But the system is not working as telemarketers keep changing operators. Also, telcos can't enforce any conditions on them. Hence, carriers say they are getting penalised for cases where they don't have any control.

spectrum allocation
very soon, an official said on Monday. The government will evaluate recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and thereafter decide on allocating spectrum to satellite communication companies, which will pave the way for satellite-based broadband services in the country.
In response to a question on the recommendation on
satcom spectrum
rules during an event on National Consumer Day, Trai Chairman A K Lahoti said it will be issued ""very soon"".
Trai concluded an open-house discussion on the terms and conditions for the assigning spectrum for certain satellite-based commercial communication services in the second week of November.
Telecom service providers like Reliance Jio and
Bharti Airtel
want spectrum for full mobility across the country should be allocated through auctions only. However, Elon Musk's Starlink and global peers like Amazon's Project Kuiper and other satellite communication companies back an administrative allocation of satcom spectrum.
With battle lines between terrestrial players and satellite aspirants clearly drawn, Trai's marathon open-house discussion stretched for several hours and saw telcos Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel banding together and speaking in unison about the need for a level-playing field as India works out the norms for satcom spectrum.

Jio, which has made a case for the auction of satellite spectrum, on Friday said it is ""not afraid of competition"" but that 'same services same rules' must apply.
The Mukesh Ambani-led firm had approached a retired Supreme Court judge for a legal opinion, which says that Trai's consultation paper on spectrum allocation for satellite communications seems to have completely sidestepped the issue of level-playing field with ground-based telecom networks.
Musk's Starlink and other global peers like Amazon's Project Kuiper back an administrative allocation of satcom spectrum.
During the open house discussion, Parnil Urdhwareshe, Director, Starlink Satellite Communications, said Indian users want satellite broadband services and these ""intelligent consumers"" have the right to choose an operator who will provide them with an affordable, high-quality service.
Starlink prices for any country are readily available on its website, and it is proud of making satellite broadband affordable for users who have so far been unserved, he pointed out.

"Regulating OTTs comes under preview of I&B ministry, concerns of Telecom Service Providers are raised: Jyotiraditya Scindia",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/regulating-otts-comes-under-preview-of-ib-ministry-concerns-of-telecom-service-providers-are-raised-jyotiraditya-scindia/articleshow/116422709.cms,18-12-2024,"New Delhi: Regulating over-the-top (OTT) platforms comes under the purview of the
Information and Broadcasting Ministry
, Union Minister for Communications
Jyotiraditya Scindia
told adding that one of the six advisory groups that he had established, had flagged the issue, highlighting concerns from the perspective of
telecom service providers
(TSPs).
""That is something that, to be very candid, comes under the domain of the Ministry of I&B (information & broadcasting). Having said that, I have six advisory groups that I have set up and this concept has come up as an issue that they would like to discuss from the point of view of the TSPs,"" Scindia said in an interview with ANI.
The debate stems from calls for OTT platforms to share the costs incurred by Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) in delivering content to consumers. While TSPs argue that cost-sharing could support much-needed investments in their network expansion, while critics highlight the potential violation of
net neutrality
principles.
Net neutrality mandates equal treatment of all internet traffic, prohibiting payments from content providers to TSPs. Introducing such payments, critics argue, could allow network operators to prioritize certain platforms, undermining the internet's democratic nature.
Proponents of cost-sharing highlight that the digital economy and telecom landscape have evolved dramatically in recent years. Between 2015 and 2023, India saw an explosive growth in mobile data consumption, with average usage per user jumping from 0.09 GB to 17.36 GB per month.

However, the expansion of network infrastructure, such as the number of mobile towers, has not kept pace with this demand. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to further amplify data consumption, intensifying the need for network upgrades.
It is argued that a blanket approach to net neutrality may no longer be sufficient to address the current challenges. Instead, a nuanced framework could balance the interests of all stakeholders.
For instance, larger OTT platforms with significant revenue streams, such as subscription fees or advertising, could be required to contribute to network costs. However, smaller or less profitable platforms might be exempt to avoid stifling innovation and competition.
At the same time, any framework must address potential contractual disputes between TSPs and OTT platforms, as well as avoid creating monopolistic practices that could harm smaller players.
One proposed solution is extending the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
's (TRAI) interconnection regulations to OTT platforms. This would establish clear rules for how OTTs and TSPs interact, ensuring transparency and fairness while maintaining net neutrality principles related to quality of service.

New chip units to be key cog in India's 6G localisation strategy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/new-chip-units-to-be-key-cog-in-indias-6g-localisation-strategy/articleshow/116397103.cms,17-12-2024,"The government will capitalise on the upcoming semiconductor manufacturing units in Assam and Gujarat to drive local production of sixth-generation network hardware, including advanced chipsets that will be used for running 6G mobile broadband networks.
The move is part of India’s strategy to boost the ‘
Make in India
’ initiative, with an aim to cut dependence on imported telecom network hardware and enhance national security, senior government officials said.
“A critical component of India's 6G strategy is local development and production of advanced chipsets that will enable devices to process and transmit data efficiently…the importance of cutting-edge chipsets cannot be overstated for 6G technology, which promises ultra-high-speed connectivity and low latency,” one of the officials told ET.
The advent of 6G technology is slated to increase the demand for semiconductors, especially since advanced chipsets typically offer superior performance and energy efficiency.
Since the 6G technology product chain will involve a complex network of suppliers, manufacturers and service providers, the government is taking steps to encourage collaborations among the Centre, academia and industry to drive investments across the entire product chain — from raw materials to finished products, the official said.
Live Events
6G wireless broadband technology is slated to arrive globally, including in India, by 2030 and is expected to pave the way for faster artificial intelligence-powered broadband networks with data speeds over 100 times faster than 5G. 6G is also expected to leverage terahertz frequencies, offering significantly wider bandwidths than 5G.
The decision to locally manufacture 6G technology chipsets comes at a time when the government, via initiatives like the Semiconductor Mission, has outlined ambitions to establish a robust local semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem.
The Union Cabinet has already given its clearance to set up multiple semiconductor units, including by Tata Electronics in Dholera (Gujarat), CG Power in Sanand (Gujarat) and Kayes Semiconductor Pvt Ltd (also in Sanand, Gujarat). Another mega semiconductor unit, backed by Tata Semiconductor Assembly & Test Pvt Ltd, is coming up at Morigaon, Assam.
This apart, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is driving multiple 6G-focused R&D projects with a total allocation of Rs 650 crore. These include 111 approved-research proposals, costing roughly Rs 239 crore, for promoting a 6G network ecosystem, and another 19 projects, backed by the Telecom Technology Development Fund, focusing on advancing 5G and paving the way for 6G. Separately, the Department of Science and Technology is funding advanced communication systems focused on 6G.
Senior DoT officials, meanwhile, downplayed recent concerns around India’s challenges in securing large funding for 6G R&D and upgrading existing 4G/5G networks to support 6G wireless broadband technology.
“India's 6G ambitions are not solely defined by budget allocations but by a comprehensive strategy that includes fostering innovation, building infrastructure and developing a skilled workforce,” said a DoT spokesperson.
Another government official said India's approach to 6G development is more strategic, in that, the Centre is adopting a more comprehensive approach to foster a robust end-to-end telecom product ecosystem with a strong emphasis on Make in India.
Global professional services firm Grant Thornton, in a recent report, said India faced significant challenges in pursuing 6G leadership, particularly in infrastructure-readiness and securing adequate funding for R&D.
Industry experts believe the modest Rs 400 crore FY25 budgetary allocation to DoT for telecom R&D may not be adequate to realise the government’s aspirations to have Indian entities own at least 10% of 6G patents globally by 2030.

affirmed the government's commitment to supporting the mobile industry, aiming for at least four to five players to bolster India's digital infrastructure. He addressed the role of satellite communication and new players like Starlink in expanding coverage.
In an interview to ToI,
Scindia
explained the rationale behind government support for the telecom sector, which has included bailouts for struggling companies. “We want a vibrant telecom sector. We want a telecom sector where we don't have a limited number of players… it's very important to have at least four-five players in this industry. Therefore, support to this industry is extremely important. Don't forget that in next decade, this industry is going to become the linchpin of India's rise on world stage.”
The minister also discussed the future of communication technologies. He sees over-the-top (OTT) communication services like WhatsApp and Telegram, along with satellite communication players, as complementary to existing networks, contributing to wider accessibility. Scindia highlighted the government's goal of connecting the remaining unconnected districts and population.
Addressing the debate surrounding regulations for OTT services, particularly regarding interception and law enforcement, Scindia stated the matter is under review by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). He also clarified the government's stance on
spectrum allocation for satellite communication
, emphasizing administrative allocation over auctions due to the shared nature of higher satellite frequencies. Scindia noted, ""If you look across the world, there is not a single country today where satellite spectrum is auctioned.” The pricing of this spectrum will be determined by TRAI.
Regarding the entry of new satellite players like Starlink, the minister confirmed India's open-door policy. Any company meeting the licensing requirements will be granted access, following established procedures. “India is open to everyone. Everyone, who comes here and applies for a licence and fulfils all norms, will be granted one.”

Trai issues 'definition' of overseas SMS traffic,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-issues-definition-of-overseas-sms-traffic/articleshow/116184523.cms,11-12-2024,"MUMBAI: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) has set a clear definition of ""
international traffic
"" as SMSes either originating or terminating from computer servers and applications from outside India.
Trai's introduction of the definition of international SMSes under the unified licence has put an end to a decade long debate between telecom operators and multinational corporations (MNCs). Until now, MNCs were processing international transactions from servers outside of India but sending SMSs from domestic systems. India's telcos said this was a way for MNCs to avoid paying almost a 20 times higher cost for delivering messages which were originating overseas.
According to the new definition, ""Any incoming application to person (A2P)
SMS message
shall be treated as an international SMS message, if it cannot be generated, transmitted or received without the use or intervention of any electronic device, computer system or computer application located outside India,"" Trai said in its recommendations released on Tuesday.
Back in August 2022, the
department of telecommunications
(DoT) had written to Trai that under the current unified license agreement, there is no explicit definition of domestic or international SMS.
Trai then released a consultation paper in May 2023, seeking industry views on the subject.
Live Events
The sector regulator had noted that only two components to domestic traffic-intra-circle and inter-circle-were defined under the unified license, and therefore, there was no need for an explicit definition for domestic traffic. But 'international traffic' needed a separate definition. The bone of contention lies in transactional messages sent by multinational companies to their customers because of the price arbitrage.
Telecom companies
charge ?0.13 per SMS for domestic messages versus ?2.3 (or nearly 20 times) for international ones. Therefore, telcos loose substantial revenue if international messages are routed through domestic channels.

TRAI seeks feedback on broadcast audit regulations post open house discussion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-seeks-feedback-on-broadcast-audit-regulations-post-open-house-discussion/articleshow/116126906.cms,09-12-2024,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
TRAI
) has invited stakeholders in the
broadcasting
industry to submit comments by December 10, following an open house discussion (OHD) on 5 December.
The OHD focused on audit-related issues under interconnection regulations and witnessed active participation from
Distribution Platform Operators
(DPOs), the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF), and consumer groups.
DPOs largely agreed that Regulation 15(1), mandating an annual system audit, has effectively reduced disputes. However, there were calls to amend Regulation 15(2), which allows broadcasters to audit DPOs' systems under certain conditions. Some suggested limiting audits to once every two years and eliminating pre-signal audits to streamline processes.
Participants recommended completing audits within nine months of the financial year, with a three-month grace period. Proposals included a 6–18 month gap between audits and the introduction of APIs to enable remote audits by broadcasters.
The IBDF criticised the current DPO-led audit framework as ineffective, citing delayed or incomplete reports that hinder broadcasters from verifying subscriber data. It proposed giving broadcasters the primary right to audit DPOs, ensuring system integrity and relieving smaller operators of financial strain.
Live Events
The Consumer Care Society emphasised the financial strain of audits on smaller DPOs, which could result in broadcasters denying their signals, thereby negatively impacting consumers. They suggested subsidies or monetary support to ensure compliance.
Stakeholders were divided on penalties for non-compliance. While some warned they could stifle growth, others advocated stringent measures, including licence cancellations for persistent violations.
While many supported infrastructure sharing across DTH, IPTV, HITS, and cable TV, the IBDF raised concerns about content security and potential revenue losses. It recommended a cautious approach through regulatory sandboxes and strict compliance safeguards.
TRAI has been urged to maintain a monthly list of non-compliant Multi-System Operators (MSOs) and to establish a balanced framework addressing both broadcaster and DPO concerns. Stakeholder feedback is expected to shape the future of regulatory practices in India's broadcasting sector.

Govt allocation of satellite spectrum not meant to favour any company: Minister,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/govt-allocation-of-satellite-spectrum-not-meant-to-favour-any-company-minister/articleshow/115981621.cms,04-12-2024,"New Delhi: The communications ministry has denied that the decision to administratively allocate
satellite spectrum
was meant to facilitate entry of
Elon Musk
's satellite internet company
Starlink
in India.
""No sir. The Telecommunications Act, 2023 provides for assignment of
spectrum
through administrative process for satellite-based services, listed in first schedule of the Act,"" the minister of state for communications and rural development, Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, said in reply to a question if the decision was made to facilitate Starlink's entry into the Indian market.
To a query around the projected revenue loss arising as a result of not auctioning satellite spectrum, the minister said spectrum assigned administratively is also chargeable, and hence contributes to revenue.
On measures taken by the government to ensure that Starlink is not used by non-state actors or hostile nations against India, the minister said that DoT grants authorisations under unified license for providing satellite-based commercial communication services.

"COAI calls on DOCA to notify rules to rein in spam calls, messages",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/spam-calls-coai-calls-on-doca-to-notify-rules-to-rein-in-ubc-menace/articleshow/115761559.cms,28-11-2024,"Kolkata: India’s top telcos have called on the department of consumer affairs (
DOCA
) to quickly notify guidelines by using its powers under Section 18 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, to expedite stringent action against individuals/entities bombarding ordinary consumers with unsolicited and unwarranted business communications (
UBC
).
This, since telcos believe the present Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation, 2018 (TCCCPR), formulated under the TRAI Act, 1997, is “an incomplete and ineffective solution,” as there are several entities in the ecosystem responsible for UBC that are outside the telecom regulator’s jurisdiction.
“UBC is a violation of consumer rights, and the DOCA guidelines, once issued, will cover all sources of UBC — whether through the telecom service provider channel or the OTT communications channel — and will provide complete protection to consumers at large,” the Cellular Operators Association of India (
COAI
), said in a letter, dated November 26, to Nidhi Khare, secretary, department of consumer affairs. The telecom sector association represents Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi),
The telecom lobby body added that the TCCCPR only imposes obligations on TSPs to address this menace by directing them to disconnect connections of users who are the source of such communication. “This is a reactive approach that does not fix the issue at its root, and so, the system continues to be misused by such users through continued innovative approaches,” COAI director general S P Kochhar said in his letter to Khare.
He added that telcos, accordingly, who are actually non-intrusive intermediaries (and therefore, exempted from liability under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000), are being held responsible for actions of certain users/businesses over whom they have no control. “Such entities also do not fall under the jurisdiction of either DoT or Trai, who can only regulate the telecom licensees.”

In his letter, Kochhar added that UBC is a growing menace as it exposes consumers to potential risks amid increasing instances of sophisticated financial scams. “With advancing digitisation and voice calls transitioning increasingly to OTT communication platforms, which falls outside the regulatory oversight of the telecom ecosystem, it is becoming more difficult to track such calls and block them.”
Accordingly, the COAI believes the present scenario requires an inclusive effort from different ministries and departments, most importantly the DOCA, to intensify efforts to ensure consumer rights are sufficiently protected as the telecom ecosystem is not adequately empowered to deal with such entities outside its domain.
The DoT, though, recently decided to bring telemarketers under regulatory control and fix accountability as part of a concerted bid by authorities to curb pesky messages and calls.
The telecom department, in fact, has sent a reference to Trai, seeking recommendations on the framework for regulating telemarketers through an authorisation mechanism.
Industry experts believe that once telemarketers are brought under some regulatory, or authorisation, framework, they can be held accountable for controlling spam along with telecom operators and will be liable to face consequences. Currently, these entities are not under any regulations that hold them responsible for the nuisance of pesky messages and calls, which are also at the heart of numerous instances of financial fraud.
The COAI, though, said that while Section 28 of the Telecommunication Act, 2023, gives DoT the authority to implement measures aimed at safeguarding users, it does not empower it to take any direct action against individual users, who may misuse telecom resources as the jurisdiction under the Telecom Act is confined only to telecom licensees.

"DoT plans to refarm 1100 MHZ spectrum from various ministries, departments",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-plans-to-refarm-1100-mhz-spectrum-from-various-ministries-departments/articleshow/115744197.cms,28-11-2024,"The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) is working on an ambitious plan to refarm or resuse more than
1100 MHZ spectrum
from various ministries and departments and reallocating it to telecom operators for
5G and 6G services
, a move that could garner over Rs 5 lakh crore for the exchequer, officials told
ET
.
DoT has identified spectrum across 10 bands which will be freed in the coming few years and put up for auction for telecom operators.
“DoT has shared the proposal for consideration to the
committee of secretaries
(CoS) and clarity will emerge in a few months about how much spectrum can be freed for mobility use,” said an official privy to the details.
Spectrum across bands including mid-band and some portion of 6 GHz is currently being utilised by the ministries of space, defence, information and broadcasting, railways and housing and urban affairs.
Live Events
Mid-band ranges from 1000 MHz (1 GHz)-6000 MHz (6 GHz), with 3500 MHz-6000 MHz best suited for 4G and 5G services.
While the telecom department has finalised the bands and quantum that can be refarmed, it has yet to give any valuation as some bands will be auctioned for the first time such as 6 GHz airwaves, while others were auctioned a few years ago, requiring the need for new price discovery through auction.
Officials estimate the value of the airwaves at over Rs5 lakh crore based on the winning bids for other bands in previous auctions.
“Once the CoS (Committee of Secretaries) takes a call, DoT will get the ball rolling for auctioning this spectrum in coming years,” a second official said.
The DoT believes there is a need to provide more airwaves, especially in mid-band and some premium lower bands, for upgrading 5G technology and introducing 6G, which is expected to be launched by 2030. Most of the spectrum is currently being utilised by legacy users such as the armed forces and the space department, which may be shifted to other frequencies.
Earlier this year, the Union cabinet approved setting up of a CoS to work on spectrum refarming. The panel comprises various departmental secretaries and senior DoT officers. Chairman of the CoS was also allowed to take assistance from external experts if required.
Experts believe in the coming few years, spectrum demand in India will accelerate in line with wider adoption of 5G technology. Anticipating this, telcos have sought more
mid-band spectrum
for 5G and 6G uses.
The industry has estimated a requirement of about 2,000 MHz in the mid-band range in the next few years, up from 400 MHz available currently. This has necessitated the need for refarming to ensure spectrum supply.
While the DoT is yet to take a call on the entire 6 GHz band, comprising 1200 MHz spectrum, it decided to use the upper 6 GHz band for mobility use. The World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) last year opened 100 MHz spectrum in 6 GHz band for mobility services worldwide while the upper 6 GHz band has been identified for IMT (mobility services) in Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Indian telcos want the entire 6 GHz band to be reserved for mobility services, while the technology industry wants delicensing of some of the airwaves for Wi-Fi use.

Cabinet clears bank guarantee waiver for spectrum auctioned since 2012,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/cabinet-clears-bank-guarantee-waiver-for-spectrum-auctioned-since-2012/articleshow/115680848.cms,26-11-2024,"The Union Cabinet has approved a proposal to waive off bank guarantee (BG) requirement for securitisation of deferred spectrum instalments for auctions conducted from 2012 onwards.
The move is going to particularly benefit
Vodafone Idea
(Vi), which was bound to submit BGs to the tune of Rs 24,700 crore for the past auctions. In afternoon trade, the telco’s stock was trading up 11.2% at Rs 7.76 on the BSE Tuesday. The Sensex was down 0.3%.
Bharti Airtel
and
Reliance Jio
too will benefit as they also don’t need to submit the BGs, though the impact will be small. Airtel was scheduled to submit BGs to the tune of Rs 2300 crore next year while the amount for Reliance Jio was around Rs 4,000 crore.
The industry welcomed the government move , describing as a ""landmark one' which will significantly help reduce the financial burden on the telecom operators in the country.
""While we are studying the details of the decision and will be able to have a more substantial view of the same, we feel positive that this decision will enhance cash flow, free up capital and enable capital investments in network expansion and technology upgrades, ensuring a stronger and robust rollout of telecom networks in the future,” Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) director general S.P. Kochhar said in a statement Tuesday. COAI represents India's top private telcos Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.

As per the decision, the BG waiver can be considered if the telco agrees to pay an additional three months’ amount along with the annual payment.
The moratorium for
spectrum auction dues
for Vi comes to an end in October 2025 and BGs have to be submitted 13 months before the next due date of payment. Vi was scheduled to submit BGs in tranches for different auctions, starting from September 20, when the telco was required to submit a BG for about Rs 4,300 crore for the 2016 spectrum auction. The telco, however, did not submit the BG. Another BG worth Rs 350 crore was due on November 1, which was also not submitted by the company.
Vi had cited its financial troubles to seek the waiver—a move which, it expects would give banks more headroom for extending credit to the company.
The waiver terms would apply for spectrum auctions of 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2021, subject to the companies agreeing to the terms. As per the telecom reforms of 2021, spectrum auctions conducted in 2022 and 2024 have done away with the requirement for BGs.
In August, the Cellular Operators Association of India, representing all private telcos, too had written to the DoT, seeking to do away with the need of BGs for auctions conducted before 2022.
Vi recently raised Rs 24,000 crore via equity. It now wants to raise a further Rs 25,000 crore via loans and another Rs 10,000 crore in BGs or letters of credit to continue its capital expenditure plans for competing effectively with Airtel and Jio. But banks are cautious due to the telco’s stressed finances and have been seeking more corporate guarantees to extend any credit.
The issue around submission of BGs came up as the DoT in late 2021 returned all the BGs as no instalment was due for 35 months. The September 2021 telecom reforms allowed telcos to avail a four-year moratorium for spectrum and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues.

DoT notifies cybersecurity norms; telcos need to share data on demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-notifies-cybersecurity-norms-telcos-need-to-share-data-on-demand/articleshow/115577196.cms,23-11-2024,"Mumbai: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has notified new cybersecurity rules which empower the government to seek traffic data from service providers.
In addition to text message content, the government can seek any other traffic data for ensuring telecom cybersecurity, according to the rules framed under the new Telecom Act, notified Thursday.
The rules define traffic data as any info generated, transmitted, received or stored in telecom networks, including type, routing, duration or time of a communication.
ET reported last week that telecom executives and legal experts have raised concerns that the new cybersecurity rules give New Delhi sweeping access to potentially privacy-breaching consumer data while increasing compliance burden for service providers who could now be held liable for the misuse of telecom resources by their subscribers.

Trai asks telcos to publish coverage maps on websites,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-asks-telcos-to-publish-coverage-maps-on-websites/articleshow/115565764.cms,22-11-2024,"Kolkata: The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) has called on mobile carriers to publish on their company websites the
geospatial coverage maps
of the geographical areas where they offer wireless voice and broadband services.
The directive is a key element of the sector regulator’s quality of services (QoS) rules for telcos. It is also aimed at empowering mobile users to take informed decisions when choosing a telecom carrier.
“Information on
mobile network coverage
is important from the perspective of QoS. One cannot expect good QoS in a non-coverage area, and availability of a service-wise geospatial coverage map on a service provider’s website will help consumers make informed decisions,” Trai said in an accompanying annexure to its directive to operators, issued Friday.
The regulator has issued a directive, calling on carriers offering wireless access services to publish on their websites “the service-wise (2G/ 3G/ 4G/ 5G) geospatial coverage maps” for geographical areas where wireless voice or wireless broadband service is available for subscription by consumers.
It added that telcos may extend availability of their coverage maps on their mobile apps, both for Android or iOS devices.
Live Events
Further, to ensure compliance, telcos are required to meet the benchmark of QoS parameter, namely, availability of service-wise geospatial coverage map on a service provider’s website for percentage of working cells (benchmark ≥ 99%) with effective from April 1, 2025.
Trai has also called on mobile operators to ensure a “link for the coverage map (with suitable logo)” be provided on the ‘Home’ or landing page of the service provider’s website at a prominent location for single-click navigation to ensure adequate visibility and ease of access.
As per Trai’s directive, mobile operators need to display their network coverage maps based on actual measurement (physical or through network analytics) or using industry standard prediction methodology. “The cell coverage of respective technologies (2G/ 3G/ 4G/ 5G) shall be presented on the coverage map in the prescribed colour scheme, having the minimum prescribed signal strength,” it added.
Trai’s guidelines for publication of these coverage maps provide mobile technology-wise minimum signal strength to be used for showing the outer boundaries of an operator’s network coverage.
Further, Trai has asked mobile operators to provide an updated status of their mobile coverage levels to consumers. It has also mandated that coverage maps be regularly updated by telcos, especially if the mobile coverage level is changed significantly in a Licensed or Authorised Service Area (LSA) network.
Trai has also asked telcos to ensure that mobile users have an option to provide feedback or even challenge network coverage indicated on map or report an issue observed in coverage through a feedback button on the map.

Trai to release spectrum recommendations for satellite broadband by December,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-to-release-spectrum-recommendations-for-satellite-broadband-by-december/articleshow/115461005.cms,20-11-2024,"The Telecom regulatory authority of India (Trai) is likely to come out with its recommendation for spectrum assignment to
satellite broadband
players and the related pricing of those airwaves by December, its chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti said.
""After the open house discussion, we analyse all the comments, counter comments, and industry's submissions. Then take two months to come up... so sometime in December,"" Lahoti told ET on the sidelines of an industry event.
The official further said that the watchdog would examine the submissions made by the stakeholders and international practices, as well as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) rules.
Earlier this month, the telecom regulator conducted an open house discussion with representatives of terrestrial and non-terrestrial network operators on the terms and conditions for the assignment of airwaves for satellite-based commercial communication services.
The incumbent
telecom service providers
such as Reliance Jio and
Bharti Airtel
said that spectrum for communication services must be allocated through the auction process ensuring a level-playing field, while billionaire Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos-owned Amazon's Project Kuiper, and other players, advocated an administrative allocation of frequencies.

The matter has snowballed into a controversy as the two warring sides together with their lobby groups such as the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), and
India Space Association
(Ispa) and Satcom Industry Association (SIA-India) have sent an array of letters to the Indian government and regulator.
Last month, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said that spectrum for satellite services would be ""allocated administratively but at a cost"" following recommendations from the telecom regulator.
Both Starlink and Amazon Kuiper have sought a predictable policy environment, and lower spectrum pricing that could allow them to offer broadband-from-space services in far-flung remote regions, not restricting to urban areas.
Both Elon Musk's Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper are yet to get permits to offer commercial satellite broadband services in the country. Only Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio and Bharti Group-backed OneWeb Eutelsat have the necessary licences.
Orbit Connect India, a joint venture between Mumbai-based Reliance Industries' Jio Platforms and Luxembourg-based SES, aims to provide satellite-based high-speed internet access in India.
Lahoti further said that telecom carriers have been disconnecting and blacklisting spammers actively.
""Consequent to the direction issued on 13th of August, nearly 18 lakh numbers were descripted, and over 800 entities or individuals were blacklisted.""
Curbing unsolicited commercial communication has become one of the top priorities of the sector watchdog, which has also formed a joint committee of regulators (JCoR) in December 2021.
The financial sector regulators along with the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) and ministry of electronics & IT (MeitY) have explored potential collaborative strategies to address and prevent unsolicited commercial communications (UCC) and fraud through voice and data services.
When asked about the rampant fraudulent calls through over-the-top (OTT) messaging platform WhatsApp, Lahoti said that the regulator has already asked MeitY to take appropriate action. ""We have also discussed this (OTT) issue during the joint committee of regulators with the MeitY. JCoR has proved to be an effective forum,"" he said.
Lahoti also said that in order to ensure quality of service (QoS), telecom service providers would be sharing monthly reports based on select parameters, from April 2025 onwards. ""For the critical parameters, we have switched to monthly reporting, and monitoring at a granular level.""

In India, a strong competition is on between telecom companies like
Reliance Jio
and
Bharti Airtel
, and global satellite companies, including Starlink and Amazon. The debate is over how satellite spectrum should be allocated and priced to support satellite-based broadband services.
Indian telecom companies have told the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) that only auctioned satellite spectrum must be used to service urban or ‘retail’ consumers. They argue that Starlink, Amazon, and other global satellite operators are planning to offer satellite broadband in cities, which would directly compete with local telecom companies.

Global satellite operators have junked with the idea of auctioning satellite spectrum, saying it is not the right approach. They argue that satellite spectrum is a shared resource, so it shouldn’t be auctioned. Starlink and Amazon plan to use their low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bring broadband-from-space services to India.
Last week, a heated discussion took place between global satellite companies Starlink and Amazon’s Project Kuiper, and India’s three major telecom operators, according to a report by ET. They discussed how satellite spectrum should be priced and managed.
Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
, and Vodafone Idea argued for equal treatment with examples to support their point. Starlink refuted their demands, even stating that in case 5G mobile spectrum can be shared between telcos, it should be given administratively, or without any auction, ET reported.
Satellite broadband services haven’t started in India yet because the government is still working on rules for pricing and spectrum allocation. TRAI’s recommendations will guide the final decision.

Satellite broadband services are yet to start in India as the government has yet to frame rules on pricing and spectrum allocation. That can happen only after Trai issues its recommendations.
Currently, only Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and a Jio-SES combine have the statutory clearances and permits to start satcom services in India. Applications of Starlink and Amazon Kuiper among others are pending with Indian authorities. US-based Globalstar too is keen to expand its satellite broadband services to India.
During the meeting, Starlink India director Parnil Urdhwareshe argued that the value of spectrum increases when used by several satellite operators, while declining in case of exclusive allocation to operators. At this moment, Reliance Jio’s regulatory head Ravi Gandhi sought to take a sarcastic tone by informing the house that telcos spend lakhs of crores for buying ‘inefficient’ spectrum.
“So, finally, it is decided that the efficient use or efficient spectrum, should be given free of cost, but so-called inefficient use, should be charged on the market price. It’s a statement which is wrong at the face of it,” Gandhi remarked.
The Jio executive highlighted that telcos have to buy spectrum through auctions by paying a hefty price and above that, they have to pay 2-3% spectrum usage charge (SUC), and in case of sharing among themselves, they have to pay an additional 0.5% SUC. But the next generation satellite firms want spectrum free, paying only 0.5 to 1% SUC and offering the same set of services, he said.
“They want to offer services in the same market, use the similar spectrum but want it free of cost, and only pay 0.5 or 1% SUC,” Gandhi said.
On satcom being a nascent market, the telcos highlighted that Starlink is talking about providing high-speed broadband connectivity to all and that it already has about 7000 low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites with the figure poised to touch 35,000 in the coming future.
Echoing the sentiments, Bharti Airtel regulatory head Rahul Vatts said due to recent developments in satcom, there is an urgent need for Trai to ensure a level playing field with terrestrial operators.
“While satcom has been there for 2 to 3 decades but with the advancement in technology, these services are increasingly becoming substitutable to terrestrial services because of higher capacities and better latencies and speeds which are getting comparable to terrestrial networks,” Vatts said.
Vodafone Idea’s Ambika Khurana said the three telcos have been bidding for spectrum for many years. “We understand how the pricing works when we bid and this pricing is linked to market forces, in a very competitive space determined by a monetary value of services, future growth and innovation, existing applications, surrounding use cases, cost of deployment, and maintenance and a lot of competition that exists into that. So, Trai should keep the factors in mind while giving its recommendations,” she said.
Starlink’s Urdhwareshe, however, debunked the telcos’ demands stating that the two sets of services are different and cannot be compared. He said mobile spectrum is more expensive as it is used exclusively and so the opportunity cost should be factored in as it can serve many users per unit kilometre and put to use in several ways. The current valuation of mobile spectrum was defined after years of auctions but the value of satellite spectrum in rupee terms has not been defined as no such data exists in India, he said.
“The value of satellite spectrum must be maximised, not the price. The value is directly equal to the number of users who can benefit from its use. Multiple operators with lots of users maximise that value, and in a proportionate AGR (adjusted gross revenue) formula maximises revenue generated for the government as well,” Urdhwareshe said.
Amazon executives too supported the AGR-based formula for satellite spectrum pricing. The telcos also highlighted coordination issues going forward on the matter and asked the regulator to finalise terms of implementation.
A telecom executive argued that since Starlink’s high bandwidth internet system covers the whole earth, it would possibly deliver more than 90% off all space-based internet traffic next year. “So, 90% of the traffic is by one company, and then we say we are effectively coordinating, because there is only one operator with whom you are coordinating. When multiple constellations come, there would be issues,” he said.
Stressing their points, the telcos also said the Telecommunications Act has included specific satellite services for administrative allocation and the rest should be auctioned. The telcos also countered satcom firms' shared spectrum claim stating that since mobile satellite services (MSS) have to be given through exclusive assignments, the spectrum should be auctioned.
Starlink also dismissed claims about indulging in predatory pricing. “We encourage Trai and all interested participants to simply look at Starlink operations in any of the 113 markets we are live in today; we maintain absolute transparency on Starlink pricing and performance around the world,” Urdhwareshe said. He, however, added the company is proud to make satellite broadband affordable and certain other satellite operators are committed to doing the same.
Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Wednesday said not a single country auctions spectrum for satellite services, and every country (including India) has to follow the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which lays out the policy on assignment of satellite spectrum. This, since India is a member of the ITU, the UN’s specialised global agency for information & communication technologies (ICT) and spectrum management. Musk has termed the comments ‘promising’.
India’s space sector regulator, IN-SPACe estimates that the country’s space economy has the potential to scale $44 billion by 2033, comprising about 8% of the global share from around 2% currently.

Ambani's Reliance lobbies for India satellite spectrum auction in new clash with Musk's Starlink,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/reliance-pushes-again-govt-for-satellite-spectrum-auction/articleshow/115075709.cms,08-11-2024,"BENGALURU: Mukesh Ambani's
Reliance
pressed India's telecom watchdog on Friday to reconsider its plan not to auction satellite spectrum but to simply allocate it, in a fresh clash with Elon Musk's Starlink.
India's telecoms Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia last month said the government would allocate spectrum administratively in line with global trends but a final notification on how spectrum is given out will come after the telecom watchdog TRAI gives its feedback.
Musk's Starlink has expressed interest in launching in India following a successful launch in Africa which left local players bruised by low broadband prices and favours the government's approach to allocating spectrum.
Ravi Gandhi, a top Reliance policy executive, urged the telecom regulator TRAI on Friday, however, to review the decision, noting in an open house discussion hosted by TRAI that the move to allocate spectrum administratively is ""the most discriminatory method of assigning any kind of government resource"".

Trump's victory may give Starlink and Amazon leverage for India satcom push
Billionaire Ambani runs India's biggest telecom company, Reliance Jio. Analysts say a spectrum auction, requiring much more investment, would likely deter foreign rivals.
The TRAI's recommendations, which will be formed over coming weeks, will be critical in deciding the future course of how satellite spectrum is doled out.
Reliance, which has dominated India's telecom sector for years, is concerned that after spending $19 billion in airwave auctions it risks losing broadband customers to Musk, and potentially even data and voice clients later as technology advances, Reuters previously reported.
The methodology of giving out spectrum for satellite services in India has been a topic of contention between the billionaires.
Musk's Starlink, a unit of SpaceX, has 6,400 active satellites orbiting earth to provide low-latency broadband to 4 million customers.
Ambani once gave data for free on his mobile plans, but Musk is no stranger to such tactics.
In Kenya, Musk priced Starlink at $10 per month, versus $120 in United States, with rental plans available for higher hardware cost. Kenya's Safaricom in July complained to local regulators, calling for players like Starlink to be required to partner with mobile networks, and not operate independently.

’s Starlink and
Amazon Kuiper
may get more leverage for their planned satellite internet operations in India with the return of
Donald Trump
as the US President. Trump is well known for his proximity to Musk.
Some of the experts said India’s top telcos Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel may now find it increasingly difficult to coax the Indian government to change its position of allocating satcom airwaves without auctions, a stance backed by Starlink and Jeff Bezos-owned Amazon.
A day after Trump’s win, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia too reiterated that satellite airwaves will not be auctioned but allocated administratively, though, at a cost to be decided by the telecom regulator.
“Given American tech billionaire Musk’s close relationship with US president-elect Trump, and the fact that both Starlink and Amazon are strongly batting for administrative allocation of satellite spectrum in India, the challenges for Jio and Bharti in pushing the government to auction these airwaves will only get bigger in coming days,” a top telecom industry consultant told ET.
More so, since policy makers in India too are inclined towards administrative allocation of satellite spectrum as is the global trend, the executive said.

A fierce battle is currently underway between Jio and Airtel — and global satellite firms — Starlink and Amazon — over the allocation mode of satellite spectrum and its pricing to support broadband-from-space services.
Making a case for equal treatment of telecom and satcom services, India’s biggest telcos have told the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) that only auctioned satellite spectrum must be used to service urban or ‘retail’ consumers as they believe Starlink, Amazon and other global satellite operators plan to offer satellite broadband services in urban areas and directly compete with local telcos.
Starlink, in a recent submission to Trai, has called the telcos' demand “self-serving, at the cost of underserved users”.
Global satellite operators have rejected the telcos’ call for auctioning satellite spectrum, calling it a misleading approach. They have held that since satcom airwaves are a shared resource, they cannot be auctioned. The likes of Starlink and Amazon plan to use their low-earth orbit (LEO) global satellite constellations to launch broadband-from-space services in India.
The telcos, though, are unfazed by the outcome of the US presidential election or Musk’s proximity to Trump. They are counting on the Indian government to finalise a fair satellite spectrum allocation and pricing policy that ensures a level-playing field between telcos and satcom companies.
“No matter who comes to the (US) White House, if India decides to auction satellite spectrum, no foreign government, even the US for that matter, is likely to interfere with that decision…the ball is now in the Indian government’s court,” said a senior executive at a Big 3 telco.
However, for now, the Indian government appears to be backing the stance of the global satellite operators.
Minister Scindia on Wednesday reportedly said that not a single country auctions spectrum for satellite services, and every country (including India) has to follow the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which lays out the policy on assignment of satellite spectrum. This, since India is a member of the ITU, the UN’s specialised global agency for information & communication technologies (ICT) and spectrum management.
Airtel, though, maintains it’s recommending the auctions route only to companies planning to launch satellite internet services in urban markets, and continues to recommend the administrative route of allocation for satellite broadband services in remote, mountainous regions, or some 5% of India.
Satellite broadband services are yet to start in India as the government has not yet finalised the rules on pricing and method of spectrum allocation. That can happen only after Trai issues its recommendations on these matters.
Currently, only Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and a Jio-SES combine have the statutory clearances and permits to start satcom services in India. Applications of Starlink and Amazon Kuiper among others are pending with Indian authorities. US-based Globalstar too is keen to expand its satellite broadband services to India.
India’s space sector regulator, IN-SPACe estimates that the country’s space economy has the potential to hit $44 billion by 2033, and account for about 8% of the global share from around 2% now.

Updated regulation on curbing spam calls likely by Jan: TRAI Chairman,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/updated-regulation-on-curbing-spam-calls-likely-by-jan-trai-chairman/articleshow/114736488.cms,29-10-2024,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) expects to finalise by January, updated and tighter regulations on curbing
spam calls
and messages after holding extensive discussions on its recent consultation paper, Chairman
Anil Kumar Lahoti
has said. Lahoti further said based on a recent reference from Telecom Department,
TRAI
will prepare and float a
consultation paper
on regulatory framework for
telemarketers
.
The TRAI Chief said series of measures taken over the past months by the regulator to combat spam calls and malicious/fraudulent messages is leading to ""significant and perceptible clean up of the system"" but noted that ""more needs to be done"".
""Our consultation paper was floated in August-end...we have already received comments and counter comments on it and now we will be analysing all the views and hold an open house discussions. It will take about three months for regulations to be finalised... so around January, we will come out with updated regulations on curbing spam,"" Lahoti told PTI.
TRAI had, in August, issued consultation paper on 'Review of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018' where the regulator amongst other issues sought stakeholder opinion on whether a higher tariff should be introduced for calls and SMS-es beyond a certain limit, in a graded manner.
The regulator in the consultation paper mooted that telecom subscribers making over 50 calls or sending out even 50 SMS-es a day, along with certain other markers, should be scrutinised as a potential pesky callers.

""To discourage usage of P2P (person-to-person) SMS-es and voice calls by UTMs (unregistered telemarketers), and strengthen the regulatory framework as enunciated in the TCCCPR-2018, a need has been felt to specify tariff for SMS and voice calls per SIM per day beyond a certain limit by persons other than an entity registered under the provisions of TCCCPR-2018,"" the consultation paper said.
At present, mobile operators provide several plans with unlimited calls.
The regulator felt that differential tariffs may make commercial communication using 10-digit numbers unviable for unregistered telemarketers. TRAI had, in fact, noted that despite punitive actions, the unsolicited calls from 10-digit mobile numbers have continued to irritate and harass customers.
TRAI has announced a slew of measures and directives to crackdown on spam and fraudulent calls and messages, over the past months.
The telecom regulator issued directive on August 13, 2024, mandating that any entity found to be making promotional voice calls in violation of regulations would face strict consequences, including disconnection of all telecom resources, blacklisting for up to two years, and a ban on new resource allocation during the blacklisting period.
TRAI in a release issued on Monday said over 800 entities/individuals have been blacklisted, and more than 18 lakh SIP DID/Mobile Numbers/Telecom resources have been disconnected marking a significant step towards cleansing the systems of commercial calls.
Further, in line with TRAI directions of August 20, 2024, access providers have implemented mandatory whitelisting of URLs, APKs, or OTT links in messages with effect from October 1, 2024. This aims to ensure that only safe and approved links can get through the SMS, so consumers are shielded from harmful or fake websites, apps, or other online threats.
With effect from October 1 2024, telemarketing calls starting with the 140xx numbering series have been migrated to the Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain) platform for strict monitoring and control.
As per TRAI, access providers have implemented technical solutions to ensure traceability of entities (senders/principal entities) involved in sending a message to recipients.
""This new system ensures that each person who handles the message, from the sender to the final delivery, is tracked,"" TRAI said in a release on Monday, adding that this involves defining Principal Entity (PE)-Telemarketers (TMs) chain through which messages travel before reaching the access provider.
To provide a transition time for awareness, technical upgrades, and chain declaration, TRAI as per its directive of October 28, 2024 has asked access providers to ensure PE-TM chain declaration by all PEs (principal entities) and telemarketers at the earliest, and the PEs and TMs who default on PE-TM chain binding to be issued a warning by respective access providers on daily basis until November 30, 2024.
""With effect from December 1, 2024, any traffic (messages) where the chain of telemarketers is not defined or does not match with predefined chain shall be rejected,"" TRAI release added.

Broadband push to keep up employment in telecom: TeamLease,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/broadband-push-to-keep-up-employment-in-telecom-teamlease/articleshow/114729330.cms,29-10-2024,"Telecom companies’ push toward
broadband penetration
is driving a surge in new
job opportunities
amid muted growth in the overall telecom sector, recruitment firm
TeamLease Services
said.
“The penetration of wired
broadband
in India currently stands at around 13%, with this figure expected to accelerate as service providers prioritize broadband services over traditional mobility products to attract higher
Average Revenue Per User
(ARPU),” the company said in a statement Tuesday.
The broadband market is expected to witness a 9-10% annual growth over the next few years,
TeamLease
said. The sector is witnessing new job roles in sales, installation, network maintenance, and
customer support
.
Besides, network operations and maintenance teams, including
fiber technicians
, Network Operations Center (NOC) personnel, and customer care professionals, are also seeing an uptick.
The average salary in the broadband sector has increased by 3.18% in the March-August 25’ period compared to the preceding six months. Notably, the number of associates have grown 47.10% over the same period.
Live Events
The broadband industry’s workforce is majorly aged between 18 and 30, with over 67% of associates falling into this age group. Nearly 41.23% of associates hold a bachelor’s degree, while 29.7% have completed their 12th standard, data showed.

Trai extends deadline on traceability mandate to December 1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-extends-deadline-on-traceability-mandate-to-december-1/articleshow/114726478.cms,30-10-2024,"New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) has granted a one-month extension to December 1 to implement the
traceability mandate
for commercial messages, including one-time passwords (OTPs), which is critical to preventing misuse, including spam and phishing.
The regulator’s move came after telcos warned of massive disruptions from November 1, if operators start blocking messages which don’t allow their origin to be traced, saying most telemarketers and business entities like banks are not yet technically prepared for the new rules.
As per the revised deadline, messages not conforming to the traceability mandate will be blocked from December 1, as against the earlier deadline of November 1.
Mobile phone operators had told Trai that messages containing OTPs and other critical activities may not be delivered as telemarketers (TM) and principal entities (PEs) such as banks and other financial institutions were yet to implement the technical solution.
In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day, as per industry data, underscoring the extent of the disruption if messages are blocked or undelivered.

The carriers told the regulator that to ensure minimum disruption and to avoid any inconvenience to consumers, they would send daily reports to telemarketers and PEs to enable them to take corrective measures. Telcos would go live with the blocking mode by December 1.
Acceding to the request from telcos, Trai said in a statement that to provide a transition time for awareness, technical upgrades, and chain declaration, it has directed telcos to ensure PE-TM chain declaration by all entities at the earliest. Those who default on the chain binding should be issued a warning by respective operators on a daily basis until November 30, 2024.
“With effect from December 1, 2024, any traffic (messages) where the chain of telemarketers is not defined or does not match with a pre-defined chain shall be rejected,” Trai said.
This is the second time that the regulator has granted an extension to the industry to implement a mandate relating to curtailing spam. Earlier, the regulator had extended the deadline for whitelisting of messages containing URLs and OTT links etc by a month till October 1, after telcos requested more time to set up the systems. Post the extension, the systems are working fine with most of the PEs and telemarketers coming on board, say officials familiar with the matter.
Whitelisting means entities sending commercial messages must provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers etc., to telcos who will then feed the information to their blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform. If the information matches, the message is passed, otherwise, it is blocked.
Trai has been taking several initiatives to curb misuse of headers and content templates for ensuring a more secure and efficient telecom ecosystem.
As part of Trai’s mandate to curb spam, over 800 entities/individuals have been blacklisted, and more than 18 lakh mobile numbers/telecom resources have been disconnected, which is a significant step towards cleansing the systems of commercial calls.
With effect from October 1, 2024, telemarketing calls starting with the 140xx numbering series have been migrated to the blockchain-based DLT platform for strict monitoring and control.

Protect key frequency bands used for satellite communications: Industry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/protect-key-frequency-bands-used-for-satellite-communications-industry/articleshow/114653001.cms,27-10-2024,"New Delhi: The
satellite-communication industry
has urged the government to protect the key
frequency bands
used by them, particularly the
Ka and Ku bands
, from being allocated to terrestrial services. The Satcom Industry Association of India has also asked the government to reserve the 27.5-28.5 GHz band exclusively for satellite services, instead of transferring it to IMT (International Mobile Telecommunications) for flexible use, in line with global practices.
""Any reduction in
satellite bandwidth
will not only double the gateway requirements but also increase operational costs for
satellite operators
, ultimately affecting end-users. We must prioritise the preservation of these frequency bands for satellite-communication services to avoid unnecessary financial burdens,"" Subba Rao Pavuluri, president,
SIA-India
, said in a statement.
The industry body has also proposed specific frequency ranges in the Ku and Ka bands for the NGSO-based Fixed Satellite Services (FSS).
SIA-India represents major satellite providers, including Inmarsat, Viasat, SES, Intelsat, Telesat, Omnispace, Amazon, AsiaSat and Hughes Communications.
The association has also called for clear guidelines on the authorisation process for instances, such as when a single satellite operator seeks to provide both a gateway earth station and user terminal services.
Live Events
""Establishing these guidelines is essential to ensure a streamlined and efficient framework that supports the growth and reliability of satellite communication services,"" Anil Prakash, director general, SIA-India, said.
The association has also advocated for long-term spectrum assignments and proposed a maximum assignment period of 20 years with renewal rights, as seen in several international regimes.
Such an approach will provide satellite operators with the necessary confidence to invest in their infrastructure and services over an extended timeframe, they have said.
Additionally, SIA-India has also suggested that a single licence should suffice for multiple antennas located at one site to streamline operations.

DoT tweaks procurement policy to promote local 5G gear production,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-tweaks-procurement-policy-to-promote-local-5g-gear-production/articleshow/114556750.cms,24-10-2024,"New Delhi: The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) has incorporated a clause in the latest
public procurement
policy order to ensure preferential treatment to
domestic companies
that achieve scale and capacity of such products to boost manufacturing of locally developed
5G technology
products.
The move will allow local companies to have an edge over their global counterparts in public sector contracts for 5G gear procurement.
""The intent is to give a clear signal to make India a telecom product nation in advanced technologies such as 5G and leading to 6G. As and when local Indian companies get ready to make such products at scale, these will find their way into our MII procurement orders so that they can be sourced from within India,"" telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal told ET.
While issuing the draft guidelines on public procurement with preference to '
Make in India
' rules, the DoT had identified 36 products that must have over 50% local value addition to be eligible for procurement by the central government and its affiliated entities. But 5G products were excluded from the list, on which local players raised concerns.

The DoT has now notified the final rules, incorporating the clause around local 5G products. The government has taken note of the fact that 5G products with
indigenous technology
are currently being tested in the country.
""Table-A (the list of 36 products) shall be reviewed from time to time and addition of 5G products/virtual routers shall be considered based on manufacturing capacity. Domestic manufacturers and their associations are encouraged to pro-actively provide evidence of manufacturing capacity from time to time to DoT to enable inclusion of such products,"" the DoT said in the notification.
As per experts, more than 10 domestic companies like Tejas, Lekha Wireless, VVDN and Galore are looking to make 5G products with some already doing trials utilising
BSNL
spectrum.
Currently, the list of products where the minimum
local content
has to be over 50% include routers, ethernet switches, media gateways, customer premises equipment, GPON equipment, satellite phones and terminals, optical fibre and cable, and telecom batteries.
On certain products, the minimum local content must be 65%. The list will be modified when local firms start large-scale manufacturing of 5G products.
Tightening the norms and pushing Make in India in July, the government had excluded imported items sourced locally from resellers and distributors from the calculation of local content.
Besides, royalties, technical charges paid out of India and supply of repackaged and refurbished goods were excluded from the calculation of local content as per the order issued by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade.
The 36 products identified by DoT have sufficient local capacity and local competition. In public procurement, preference is given to class-I suppliers. In case, the class-I supplier is not able to supply, class-II supplier will be given a chance.
A class-I local supplier means a supplier whose goods and services offered for procurement have at least 50% local content while a class-II supplier has at least 20% local content. All manufacturers making products under production linked incentive scheme for telecom and networking products will be treated as class-II suppliers for the specified products.

TRAI seeks comments from stakeholders on authorisation for telecom and cloud-based networks,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-seeks-comments-from-stakeholders-on-authorisation-for-telecom-and-cloud-based-networks/articleshow/114474649.cms,22-10-2024,"New Delhi: The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) has sought comments from stakeholders regarding the authorisation that would be granted for setting telecommunications, satellite or cloud-hosted
telecommunications networks
.
The 166-page consultation paper, comprising 37 questions, follows a reference from
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) dated July 26, seeking to get recommendations on terms and conditions, including fees or charges, for authorisation to establish, operate, maintain or expand telecommunications network as per the provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 2023.
Subsequently, the DoT sent another letter, requesting the authority to consider an authorisation for
satellite communication
network under section 3(1)(b) of the Telecommunications Act, 2023.
The authority has already given its recommendations for service authorisation and through the latest paper, it will delve upon the network authorisation. The Telecommunications Act provides for different terms and conditions of authorisation for different types of
telecommunication services
and telecommunication networks.
In its reference, DoT said keeping in view the increasing use of non-terrestrial networks including satellite communication networks in provisioning of fixed satellite services, including VSAT services and mobile satellite services, Trai may consider an authorisation for satellite communication network and what should be the terms and conditions for that.
Live Events
With the notification of the Telecommunications Act, the government is replacing the erstwhile licensing regime with
authorisation regime
. There are a few differences between the two regimes.
Under the
Indian Telegraph Act
, the Central Government granted licenses for establishing, maintaining or working a telegraph. On the other hand, the Telecommunications Act, 2023 envisages the grant of authorisations.
“Therefore, one of the effects of the enactment of the Telecommunication Act, 2023 would be that, henceforth, any person, intending to establish, operate, maintain or expand telecommunication network, will have to obtain from the Central Government an authorisation under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 instead of a license under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,” Trai said.
Through the paper, the authority seeks to know if there is a need to merge the scopes of infrastructure provider-I (IP-I) and digital connectivity infrastructure provider (DCIP) authorization (as recommended by Trai in August 2023), into a single authorisation.
It wants to know if there is a need to introduce a new authorisation for establishing, operating, maintaining or expanding in-building solution (IBS) or there is a need to make any changes in the eligibility conditions, area of operation, validity period of authorisation, scope, and terms & conditions of the
Content Delivery Network
(CDN) authorisation.
Stakeholders can send their comments by November 12 and counter comments by November 19.

Mission 4G in green tangle over towers in forest land,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/mission-4g-in-green-tangle-over-towers-in-forest-land/articleshow/114358351.cms,18-10-2024,"New Delhi: The
department of telecommunications
(
DoT
) is learnt to have sought several exemptions from the environment ministry's 4G tower related rulebook to expedite the mission to saturate coverage across remote and uncovered village areas, including in protected forest regions.
ET has learnt that the environment ministry is yet to take a final view on DoT's request for relaxation in some of the six clauses outlined in its guidelines. These clauses ask for the district collector's undertaking and provision of call records of offenders of wild life laws to the environment ministry, among other requirements.
The issue was taken up for consideration in the July 31 and October 9 meetings of the standing committee of the
National Board of Wild Life
, chaired by environment minister
Bhupender Yadav
.
It was agreed at the last meeting that a separate special discussion will be held on the policy considerations involved. The government aims to cover all villages under the '4G Saturation Mission' by the end of 2024.
DoT had written to the environment ministry on April 25, seeking exemptions from the 04.01.2024 'guidelines for submission of proposals regarding 4G connectivity for seeking recommendations of the standing committee of the National Board for Wild Life' (NBWL). The guidelines were drawn up as NBWL is currently faced with a barrage of DoT applications for use of forest land/wild life habitat to erect mobile towers and lay cables.
Live Events
The norms require the user agency to provide an undertaking from the district magistrate indicating non-availability of alternative land, movement plan for installation of the tower facility, undertaking to provide call records of those violating the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, if sought by the deputy conservator of forests and higher authorities to check poaching, and the chief wild life warden's view on the impact of such a tower on wildlife.
DoT, however, has written to the ministry seeking modification/relaxations in most clauses. It has said that the requirement of an undertaking from the district magistrate on unavailability of non-forest land should be done away with as it will result in ""additional delay in overall clearance progress"". It has proposed that such a certification from any other revenue officer - not below the post of sub-divisional magistrate - should be accepted.
DoT has said it is not possible to provide call records, as the environment ministry has stipulated, since this can only be done through statutory provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, besides established protocols.
DoT has said that a ""standard plan"" for movement of vehicles and workforce for erection of telecommunication towers be accepted instead of a new one per case, as not more than three truckloads of equipment are involved in the construction process and little to no movement or personnel deployment is required thereafter.
On the ministry's insistence on solar power usage for operation of mobile towers, DoT has said this will be the primary source, except in places where solar energy or normal electricity connectivity is not feasible, and such sites are less than 1% of the total.
On the requirement of the chief wild life warden's comment on the impact of towers on wild life habitat, DoT has said that most telecom towers are within village areas and occupy no more than 0.02 hectares.
""These are unmanned sites and thus movement at sites is minimal. Thus, it will not impact wild life management. Thus this requirement may be done away with for these projects,"" DoT said.
NBWL had observed in its July 31 meeting: ""While providing connectivity to the people residing within or near the limits of these wild life-rich areas should be taken on priority, the protection and conservation of wild life habitats should also not get affected within such instalments.""
Further, erection of these 40m-high towers often requires building approach roads, laying of optical fibre cables, supply of power gensets.

Trai extends comments deadline for satcom spectrum pricing paper,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-extends-comments-deadline-for-satcom-spectrum-pricing-paper/articleshow/114355213.cms,18-10-2024,"The telecom regulator has granted a week’s extension for submission of stakeholder comments and counter-comments on its discussion paper on the pricing methodology and terms and conditions of allocating
satellite spectrum
— without auctions — to companies seeking to launch satellite broadband services in India.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) has now sought comments and counter-comments by October 25 and November 1 respectively instead of the earlier October 18 and October 25 deadlines following stakeholder requests for more time.
Trai’s discussion paper had sought suggestions on whether satellite spectrum must be charged on a per MHz (or unit) basis, or as a percentage of a satellite player’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR), or via a new formula.
The Trai paper has assumed huge importance, especially since US billionaire Elon Musk wants to compete and offer internet services in India through his Starlink low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, setting the stage for a fierce clash with India’s top telcos, iMukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio and Sunil Mittal-headed
Bharti Airtel
.
India’s top telco, Jio recently wrote to the government, seeking auction of satellite spectrum and reissuance of Trai’s recent consultation paper as it feels the paper does not seek to discuss issues around level-playing field between telcos and satcom companies. But communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia recently said at IMC-2024 that satellite spectrum would be allocated administratively, though at a cost, which would be decided by the telecom regulator.

Accordingly, in the run-up to Trai’s recommendations to the DoT, a high-stakes war of words is underway over the allocation of spectrum to support broadband-from-space services.
Satcom biggies such as Musk-owned Starlink and Amazon Kuiper have sought lower spectrum prices in India, with the Jeff Bezos-owned US major warning that pricey airwaves would force global players to target consumers in the South Asian nation’s urban areas, rather than just remote regions. But any such move to service urban users would instantly pitch them directly against India’s telcos Jio and Airtel.
Starlink has also reiterated its stance that spectrum for satellite services is a shared resource and can’t be auctioned, reiterating a view that has pitched it against India’s largest telco Reliance Jio. Bharti Airtel too has pitched for auction of spectrum if satcom services are delivered to any area, except the remote geographies.

""When AERA determines the tariff for aeronautical services in terms of Section 13(1)(a) of the AERA Act, it is acting as a regulator and an interested party. It is interested not in a personal capacity. Its interest lies in ensuring that the concerns of
public interest
... are duly preserved. Thus, AERA is a necessary party in the appeal against its tariff order before TDSAT and it must be impleaded as a respondent,"" directed the bench.
The top court said the AERA can be impleaded as a respondent in an appeal against its order even if the provisions of the statute do not provide for it.
This power can be read by necessary implication based on the role conferred on the Authority by the statute, it said.

TDSAT in its order had held that AERA lacks authority for imposition of tariffs on services such as ground and cargo handling.
The tribunal had previously held that ground and cargo handling can be classified into ""non-aeronautical services"" under the AERA Act, 2008.
The TDSAT's order had come on January 13, 2023, on a plea filed by
Delhi International Airport Ltd
and Mumbai International Airport Ltd., challenging a communications by AERA on the issue of tariff.
The top court directed its Registry to list the matter before the regular bench for adjudication of the appeals on merits.

Ambani Vs Musk: Reliance lobbies for satellite spectrum auction; Starlink boss says ‘unprecedented’,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/ambani-vs-musk-reliance-lobbies-for-satellite-spectrum-auction-starlink-boss-says-unprecedented/videoshow/114258411.cms,15-10-2024,

boss
Elon Musk
said a move by India to auction
satellite broadband spectrum
, and not allocate it, would be ""unprecedented"", reacting to a Reuters story that rival billionaire
Mukesh Ambani
was lobbying for the auction route.
In what is seen as a battle between the two billionaires, Starlink argues administrative allotment of licences is in line with a global trend, while Ambani's
Reliance
says an auction is needed for a level playing field as foreign players could offer voice and data services and compete with traditional telecom players.

Airtel's Sunil Mittal echoes what Ambani has been asking for satellite companies in India
On Sunday, Reuters reported Ambani's
Reliance
has argued India's telecom regulator has incorrectly concluded that home satellite broadband spectrum should be allocated and not auctioned, without seeking industry feedback, and the consultation process must start afresh.
Reacting to the news, Musk wrote on X that any such decision to auction as Reliance is lobbying for ""would be unprecedented.""
Live Events
""This spectrum was long designated by the ITU as shared spectrum for satellites,"" he wrote late on Monday on X, referring to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized UN agency for digital technology.
India is a member of the ITU and signatory to its treaty that regulates
satellite spectrum
and advocates that allocation must be done ""rationally, efficiently and economically"" as it's a ""limited natural resource.""
Reliance did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. It has previously told Reuters it is ""imperative"" upon the Indian regulator to consult on the methodology of spectrum assignment.
The methodology of giving out spectrum for satellite services in India - a market set to grow 36% a year to reach $1.9 billion by 2030 - has been a contentious issue since last year.
Musk's Starlink and global peers like Amazon's Project Kuiper back an administrative allocation, saying it is a natural resource that should be shared by companies. Ambani, Asia's wealthiest man, is arguing for an auction process.
Reliance's latest lobbying move in India has intensified a face-off with Musk who wants to launch Starlink services in India but has voted for the spectrum allocation route, in which the government simply assigns spectrum to the companies.
An Indian government source told Reuters on Sunday the regulator was following due process of consultation.

Telemarketing entities should be regulated to curb spam: Telcos to Trai,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telemarketing-entities-should-be-regulated-to-curb-spam-telcos-to-trai/articleshow/114138850.cms,12-10-2024,"Telemarketing entities or resellers of SMS services must be brought under government’s licensing regime to hold them accountable for culprits transmitting
spam messages
across the delivery value chain, otherwise “this piecemeal approach” will not yield any positive results,
telecom companies
have argued.
Over 2,80,000 businesses in India send commercial SMSes, which are aggregated by 16,000 telemarketing aggregators. These are then passed on to 15 delivery telemarketers who are connected to every telco to handover entire
commercial SMS
traffic. Thus, telcos do not have visibility of
SMS delivery chain
beyond these 15 senders and therefore, cannot control spam, they argue.
“TM-D is clearly a reseller of services and should be either licensed like VNO or should be authorized by DoT under the upcoming authorization regime under Indian Telecommunication Act 2023,” Reliance Jio said in its submission to an ongoing industry consultation on TCCCP Regulations for preventing spam.
Airtel further added that if such a licensing or authorisation is not possible, then direct connectivity between telecom companies and principal entities (business senders) should be mandated.
Live Events
As per above numbers, such an arrangement can push 16,000 telemarketing entities out of business.
Telcos have once again highlighted that the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(TRAI) is ignoring the “parallel spam market” emerging on
OTT platforms
such as WhatsApp, who are the “chief abettors of fraud by carrying fraud URLs/APKs/CTAs,” Jio said.
“This lack of (uniform) regulation has led to differential treatment for controlling spam between OTT platforms and TSPs,” Airtel said.
On the other hand, to check spam originating from personal numbers, the telecom regulator had asked whether differential tariff for such entities could be a punitive measure to discourage such spammers.
Jio argued that such an “approach is flawed and needs to be revamped towards regulating the real culprit i.e. PE/TM instead of punishing the consumers by differential tariffs.”
Airtel suggested that TRAI can consider measures like shifting costs to initiation attempts rather than termination.
Vodafone Idea supported the Authority’s suggestion but cautioned that the same should be carried out after deeper analysis and careful consideration to prevent larger impact on the genuine consumers.
According to analysis, there were nearly 14 lakh SIMs making between 50-1000 calls per day during the January-March 2024 period, TRAI had said in its consultation paper released in August. Four SIMs were making more than 1000 calls per day! These are likely to be spam callers who disregard TRAI’s norms defined for commercial calling.
Similarly, there were 4 lakh SIMs which were found to send more than 50 SMSes per day. Even though telecom companies have blocked 59k such numbers in calendar years 2022-23, these spammers continue to purchase new SIM cards, TRAI showed.
Among other notable suggestions on the consultation, Truecaller suggested that for spam reporting and complaint handling, TRAI must formally integrate third-party applications into its framework. It also sought that TRAI must clarify the definition of international traffic.

"Jio pushes Trai to revise satcom paper on pricing, include level playing field",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/jio-pushes-trai-to-revise-satcom-paper-on-pricing-include-level-playing-field/articleshow/114007243.cms,07-10-2024,"Reliance Jio
has urged
Trai
to revise the consultation paper on
satellite spectrum pricing
as it feels that the critical aspect of level-playing field between satellite and terrestrial networks has been overlooked by the regulator.
The operator has also questioned the tilt towards
administrative allocation
of satellite spectrum, raising pitch for auction of such airwaves.
In a letter to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Chairman AK Lahoti, Jio said the omission has resulted in the lack of any questions addressing the need to create a
level playing field
between satellite and terrestrial services.
“Consequently, stakeholders will not be able to adequately consider and provide relevant inputs to Trai, thereby undermining the fairness of recommendations and the government’s intent to promote balanced competition,” Trai said in the letter, dated October 4, a copy of which has been seen by ET.
The country’s largest
telecom operator
highlights that the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) reference to Trai sent on July 11, 2024, had asked for the recommendations on the terms and conditions of spectrum assignment, including spectrum pricing, while considering the need for a level playing field with terrestrial access services.
Live Events
“This deviation makes the consultation paper and the consequent recommendations vulnerable to legal challenges, particularly since it fails to address the issue outlined in the DoT’s reference, such as ensuring level playing field,” Jio said in the letter, a copy of which was also sent to Communications Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia. Telecom Secretary Neeraj Mittal and other DoT officials.
Further, the telco has questioned the tilt towards administrative allocation for satellite spectrum, which undermines the Section 4 of the Telecommunications Act, 2023. “Section 4(5)(a) of the Act emphasizes auction as the default method for assigning spectrum for commercial services. As per the Act, all spectrum usages, including those in the First Schedule, should be evaluated against sub-clauses (i),(ii), and (iii) of Section 4(5)(a),” the letter said.
Jio said the absence of a detailed discussion on these provisions in the consultation paper raises concerns about its alignment with the Telecommunications Act, 2023.
“Both auction and administrative assignment methods should remain open for stakeholders’ input, with due consideration given to competitive forces,” the telco said.
Trai on September 27 came out with a consultation paper seeking views on the pricing methodology and terms and conditions of allocating satellite spectrum — without auctions — to companies seeking to launch
satellite broadband services
in the country.
In its reference to Trai, DoT had said it’s “essential to examine whether a level-playing field exists” between terrestrial access service providers and satellite players planning to offer fixed and mobile satellite services in India via low-earth orbit (LEO), medium earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary orbit (GEO) global satellite systems.

Through the CP titled 'Formulating a Digital Radio Broadcast Policy for
Private Radio Broadcasters
', the regulator has also sought comments on the timeframe required for various activities related to the migration of existing FM radio broadcasters to digital radio broadcasting.
Trai has asked the stakeholders to provide written comments on the consultation paper by October 28 and counter comments, if any, by November 11.
The
ministry of information and broadcasting
(
MIB
) had sent a reference dated April 23, 2024 seeking Trai's recommendations on formulating a digital radio broadcast policy for private radio broadcasters.
In its reference, the MIB stated that some existing provisions under FM Phase-III policy may require a relook in order to cater to technology shifts. In 2018, Trai gave its suo-motu recommendations urging the government to come out with a detailed policy framework for digital radio broadcasting in India.

Trai has also asked the stakeholders to suggest whether a single or multiple digital
radio technology
adoption is preferable for the entire country and the challenges therein.
Other key issues for consultation include whether a minimum amount of annual fee should be charged for digital radio broadcasting services.
For FM radio channels that are migrating to digital radio broadcasting, the regulator has asked if the annual fee of 4% of gross revenue only and de-linking it from non-refundable one-time entry fee (NOTEF) should be made applicable.
At present, analogue terrestrial radio broadcast in India is carried out in medium wave (MW) (526-1606KHz), short wave (SW) (6-22 MHz) and VHF-II (88-108 MHz), popularly also known as FM band, spectrum bands.
The regulator noted that digital radio broadcasting has several advantages over analogue radio broadcasting as it is capable of broadcasting three to four channels on a single frequency carrier, while ensuring excellent quality of audio for all the channels. In analogue mode, only one channel broadcasting is possible on a frequency carrier.

Telcos can operate under existing licences till they are valid: Trai,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telcos-can-continue-providing-services-under-current-regime-till-licence-expires-trai/articleshow/113675033.cms,25-09-2024,"New Delhi: Telecom operators can continue providing services under the current licensing regime if they want to, till the validity of their respective licenses, the telecom regulator has said, allaying fears of telcos, which feel any change in contractual agreement would lead to regulatory uncertainty.
The proposed
authorisation mechanism
will kick-in for the existing telcos at the time of renewal of their licenses, assuming the government accepts the recommendations of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
).
“They (telcos) can continue to operate under their existing licenses as long as they are valid. But once the license expires, they will have no other option..But they will only have to pay the renewal fee,” said TRAI chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti, addressing reporters Wednesday.
The telcos want the government to continue with the current practice of a contract between a telco and DoT in laying out terms and conditions as part of the license agreement. However, Trai has proposed an authorisation mechanism, wherein a company can be authorised to offer services while terms and conditions would be notified separately under the Telecommunications Act.
“There have been certain apprehensions from the industry side that the rules can be amended without their knowledge..in the existing licensing regime also the government has the final powers to change the license,” Lahoti said.

Lahoti also said it would soon come out with a consultation paper on satellite spectrum pricing and will also take a revised look at the over-the-top (OTT) regulation paper. The relook at OTT paper would be done based on the notification of the Telecommunications Act.
SB Singh, Principal Advisor at Trai, said the regulator has suggested to the government that whenever there is a substantial change which is required to be done in the new regime, recommendations of Trai should be sought.
The regulator also said it has recommended the government to provide a glide path to financial accounting and reporting, assignment of spectrum and numbering resources at a national level for entities obtaining unified service authorisation.
The telecom regulator, in its recommendations, has suggested a unified authorisation to offer all kinds of telecom services, from mobile and internet to international calls and satellite connectivity.
“If a similar service had to be provided, it would have required 22 licenses for 22 license areas under the current regime, and then you could provide services pan India. Now it is a single authorisation model and all services can be given. There, a thing to be noted is we have included satellite services also,” Singh said.
The advantage for the four large telcos under the proposed model, Singh explained, is that the internal traffic can be routed from anywhere to anywhere based on their own network design, which presently has a lot of restrictions.
Singh said the proposed model allows telecom operators to use third party cloud infrastructure, and share resources among other operators without much restrictions.
The proposed changes, the regulator said, can benefit the public, particularly in the quality of service and competitive tariffs. The changes will make for availability of telecom services in remote areas, and support for emergency services through satellite systems.
For telcos, the simplified authorisation regime allows for easier migration of existing service providers and entry of new players. The proposed model brings an enhanced scope of service, reduced cost, flexibility, lower entry fee and more.

Trai's call to merge satcom licenses to attract top dollars from global investors,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trais-call-to-merge-satcom-licenses-to-attract-top-dollars-from-global-investors/articleshow/113627883.cms,25-09-2024,"Top satellite communication providers are divided on the telecom regulator’s recommendation to merge key satcom service permits into a single authorisation.
Broadband India Forum
(BIF), representing Bharti-backed
Eutelsat OneWeb
, Amazon-Kuiper and Hughes Network Systems, has backed the idea while Satcom Industry Association (SIA) India, which represents Luxembourg’s SES, AsiaSat, Canada’s Telesat and US-based Intelsat among others, is opposed to it.
The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) in recent recommendations to the government mooteda single authorisation for satellite telecommunication services by merging the VSAT and Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite (GMPCS) licences.
BIF said this will enhance the business scope of satellite services, speed up approvals and ring in ease of doing business.
SIA India, however, said “a one-size-fits-all approach” may complicate compliance.
Live Events
“Separate frameworks can facilitate tailored regulations that address the unique technical and security requirements of GMPCS and VSAT services, allowing for more effective oversight,” Anil Prakash, director general of SIA India, told ET.
Maintaining separate frameworks would also ensure the regulations are customised to meet the specific needs of each service, especially since GMPCS and VSAT operate under distinct technical and security parameters, he added.
Apart from single licence, Trai has also called for removing the extant restriction on VSAT operators to provide services to only a closed user group (CUG) under the proposed authorisation framework. “Both VSAT-based FSS (fixed satellite services) and GMPCS service have been included under the scope of satellite-based telecommunication service authorisation,” it said.
At present, satcom companies need a GMPCS permit from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and a host of other regulatory approvals, including landing rights from national space sector regulator Indian National Space Promotion & Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), before launching commercial broadband-from-space services in India.
Satellite players, though, are broadly in agreement that if the government backs Trai and gives satcom companies the permission to operate internet and broadband services under the new satellite services authorisation, it would go a long way in bridging the digital divide in rural India via satellite services.
Both BIF and SIA India believe such a move will ring in regulatory clarity and create a more conducive environment for attracting top dollars from the biggest global satellite constellation operators such as Eutelsat OneWeb, Elon Musk’s Starlink, Amazon-Kuiper, SES and Telesat.
“By establishing a clear regulatory framework, these low-earth orbit (LEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite constellation operators may find greater confidence in navigating the India market, leading to increased investment in infrastructure and services that enhance satellite broadband connectivity across the country,” SIA India’s Prakash said.
BIF president T V Ramachandran, in turn, said permission to provide internet and broadband services through the new satellite service authorisation is also vital for ease of doing business and tapping the huge revenue potential by serving unconnected millions.
“Trai’s recommendations, if accepted by the Centre, can be a genuine gamechanger for the satcom sector in India and help attract billions of dollars of
foreign direct investment
(FDI) from the biggest global names in the satellites space,” Ramachandran said.
Nearly 75% of rural India still does not have access to fast broadband as many locations are without cellular or fibre connectivity. As a result, satellite systems, which can be rolled out at a much faster clip than terrestrial telecom networks in rural and remote regions, are seen as a viable alternative to connect the unconnected.
IN-SPACe recently estimated that the country’s space economy has the potential to hit $44 billion, or about Rs 3.6 lakh crore, by 2033, and account for about 8% of the global market, up from around 2% now.
Broadband-from-space services, though, can be rolled out commercially only after the government allocates satellite spectrum to the companies via the administrative route.
Global biggies such as Kuiper, Starlink and Globalstar – Apple’s satcom services partner – are keen to launch
satellite broadband services
in India’s still nascent satcom market with high growth potential.
At present, only Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Orbit Connect India – a 51:49 joint venture between Reliance Industries’ Jio Platforms (JPL) and Luxembourg’s SES – have GMPCS permits and the required IN-SPACe authorisations to launch satellite broadband services in India.
Satellite sector executives said Trai’s other key suggestion to allow the use of in-country earth stations to offer satcom services in foreign countries – if backed by the government – could prise open new revenue streams for satellite players operating in India and help monetise their substantial investments in satcom ground infrastructure.

Trai tightens quality of service norms,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-tightens-quality-of-service-norms/articleshow/113499621.cms,19-09-2024,"Mumbai: Notwithstanding opposition from
telecom
companies to the new quality of service rules, the regulator has gone ahead and directed them to submit compliance reports with effect from October 1.

Telcos had termed the new service quality rules set by the regulator as stringent and said they would increase their cost and compliance burden.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
TRAI
) had also held a meeting with the service providers on August 21 to discuss the key aspects of the regulations. The last date of submitting the inputs was extended to August 27.
However, “the Authority has observed that the service providers have not submitted their input, by the extended date of submission,” TRAI said in Thursday’s notification.
Last month, TRAI had released tighter quality norms around 4G and 5G networks, increased the financial penalties for not meeting benchmarks and directed telcos to compensate mobile phone users with rent rebates and validity extensions in case mobile service outages continue for more than 24 hours.

On Thursday, the Authority issued the prescribed format for submitting the performance monitoring reports to be followed by wireless and wireline access service providers who shall be reporting to the regulator within 15 days after the end of each quarter.
The new parameters released by TRAI will be used to measure quality of fixed, wireless and broadband services, with an aim to reduce instances of call drops and improve quality of telecommunication services for consumers. The new regulations come into effect from October 1.
To achieve time bound action on quality of service (QoS) related issues, TRAI increased the financial penalty to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 earlier for not meeting the benchmarks. The regulator has also introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations under revised regulations.

Trai recommends overhaul of telecom licensing regime,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-recommends-overhaul-of-telecom-licensing-regime/articleshow/113467447.cms,18-09-2024,"The telecom regulator has proposed a complete overhaul of the licensing regime, suggesting a
unified authorisation
to offer all kinds of
telecom services
from mobile and internet to international calls across the country, and three broad categories of service – main, auxiliary and captive.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) has also suggested one authorisation for
satellite telecommunication
, merging the VSAT and Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite (GMPCS) licences.
As per the proposal, a unified authorisation will enable an entity to offer all kinds of telecom services including mobile, internet, landline, national long distance (NLD), international long distance (ILD), satellite, machine-to-machine (M2M), etc across the country.
The regulator has suggested reducing the entry fee for taking various authorisations and not charging any fee for renewal of the authorisations.
If and when accepted by the government, the authorisation mechanism will replace the current licensing regime.

While Trai has laid out authorisation terms and conditions for telecom operators, satellite players, internet service providers and M2M among others, over-the-top (OTT) has been kept out of the mechanism.
Elaborating on the three service authorisations, Trai said the main service authorisation can be granted in two subcategories – network service operator (NSO) and virtual network operator (VNO).
Auxiliary service authorisation should be given for services like PMRTS, PM-WANI, M2M service, WPAN/ WLAN connectivity service, enterprise communication services, IFMC, data communication service between aircraft and ground stations, etc.
Captive service authorisation is meant for establishment of captive networks like private networks, it said.
The regulator has reworked the existing licensing regime for different services and categories and merged various categories. For instance, the unified service authorisation has been introduced to achieve the objective of ‘One nation - one authorisation’ across services and service areas.
The telecom department (DoT) will now need to consider the recommendations, and accept or reject them, or send them back to the regulator for changes.
If it accepts them, telcos like
Bharti Airtel
,
Reliance Jio
and
Vodafone Idea
will not be required to take multiple authorisations for each service.
Currently, despite taking a pan-India unified license, they have to work circle-wise for different services.
Under the proposed framework, “advantages such as a flexibility to carry its own traffic and interconnect with other authorised entities will be available in the immediate time frame,” Trai said in its over 800-page recommendations. “The authority will review the interconnection framework and make it in line with the above recommendations, wherever required.”
This was a key demand of the telecom industry as currently the accounting happens circle-wise and the players pay the levies circle-wise. Once the system is moved to the national level, the payments will be streamlined.
The regulator has also removed the extant restriction on VSAT operators to provide services to only closed user group (CUG) under the new authorisation framework. “Both VSAT-based FSS (fixed satellite services) and GMPCS service have been included under the scope of satellite-based telecommunication service authorisation,” it said.
Trai has recommended that use of non-terrestrial network (NTN) should be permitted in the scope of access services.
Satellite-based telecommunications service providers will be able to offer both fixed and mobile services. They will also be permitted to make use of the satellite earth station gateways established in India for providing service in foreign countries, after obtaining permission from the Centre.
Similarly, Trai has proposed merging NLD and ILD services in a single authorisation called long-distance service authorisation.
Trai has also recommended reducing the entry fee for taking various authorisations. For instance, the unified service authorisation can be taken for an entry fee of Rs 12 crore as against Rs 15 crore for a pan-India unified licence. It has also recommended elimination of entry fee at the time of renewal of authorisation.
The regulator has also allowed all kinds of infrastructure sharing among the industry players. The authorised entities like telcos, ISPs, etc have been permitted to take telecommunication resources on lease or hire from cloud service providers, which are either empanelled by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
Trai has also proposed creation of a subcategory C authorisation that will allow small firms to offer services in up to four cities.

"PM-WANI rule changes seen to give big boost to Wi-Fi hotspots, create lakhs of micro-entrepreneurs",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/pm-wani-rule-changes-seen-to-give-big-boost-to-wi-fi-hotspots-create-lakhs-of-micro-entrepreneurs/articleshow/113432819.cms,17-09-2024,"New Delhi: The amendments to the
PM-WANI
framework guidelines will encourage more individuals to run
Wi-Fi hotspots
within their local community, thus creating lakhs of micro-entrepreneurs in India, Broadband India Forum (BIF) said Tuesday.
BIF, which represents technology firms like Meta, Google, Amazon,
TCS
etc, also refuted the arguments given by telcos that PM-WANI was redundant, and it can cause revenue loss. “If India were to establish 50 million PM-WANI hotspots, as targeted, telcos could gain an additional Rs 60,000 crore in revenue annually from bandwidth sales in addition to the benefit they will get by having more broadband users, which they might not reach otherwise,” BIF said in a statement.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has amended the guidelines for the Prime Minister
Wi-Fi
Access Network Interface (PM-WANI) allowing roaming between public data office aggregator (PDOA), removing the need for a commercial agreement between a telco and PDO, allowing the PDOs or public data office to use the existing access points for public and private use. Also, the PDOs have been permitted to accept mobile data offload from the telcos, thereby helping ease the congestion on the mobile network.
BIF said these amendments are likely to unlock the potential of PM-WANI for both public Wi-Fi providers and users, making affordable internet accessible to millions.
“The amendments will help unleash the true potential of PM-WANI by providing structural changes through ease of doing business, which shall help in directly addressing the bottlenecks that have hindered the growth of PM-WANI thereby making it a truly transformative force in achieving the goals of Digital India,” TV Ramachandran, President of BIF said.
Live Events
The tech industry association said the barrier of ‘commercial agreement’ at “exorbitant rates” which PDOs were forced to enter into with telecom firms and internet service providers for internet connectivity has been removed.
BIF said commercial agreement was misinterpreted by telcos to enforce PDOs to take only internet leased lines at commercial tariffs. “This resulted in a connection that should have cost a few thousand rupees per annum to PDO for public Wi-Fi being given at Rs 4-Rs 8 lakh per annum in the name of commercial agreement/commercial tariff,” BIF said.

DoT simplifies rules for experimental and demonstration licenses,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-simplifies-rules-for-experimental-and-demonstration-licenses/articleshow/113232556.cms,10-09-2024,"New Delhi: The Department of Telecommunications (
DoT
) has simplified the approval process for issuance of experimental and demonstration licenses with introduction of fixed timelines. Further, companies will be able to get approvals for license-exempt wireless devices on a self-certification basis.
The changes are part of DoT’s efforts to enhance ease of doing business in the telecom sector with an aim to reduce delays and simplify regulatory requirements. The changes have been incorporated based on the recommendations of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
).
As per the latest rules, for experimental licenses (radiating category), the license will be deemed issued after 30 days of application if no decision is conveyed for cases where no inter-ministerial consultation is needed. In cases requiring inter-ministerial consultation, the DoT will seek comments within seven days of receiving a complete application. If no comments are received, a provisional license will be granted after 60 days, which will be converted to a regular license after 90 days, provided there are no adverse comments.
Similarly, for demonstration licenses (radiating category), licenses without inter-ministerial consultation will be deemed granted after 15 days. For those requiring consultation, licenses will be deemed granted after 45 days once comments are sought from relevant authorities.
Other applicable terms and conditions will continue to apply. “If any unfavourable inter-ministerial comments are received during the approval process, the provisional license will be cancelled, and the experiment must be stopped immediately,” DoT said in a statement.
Live Events
In the event of the cancellation of a provisional or regular license, or upon the expiry of the experimental/demonstration period, users must ensure the radio equipment is covered under relevant possession rules, returned to its source, or disposed of in accordance with existing guidelines.
Further, all the applications of equipment type approvals (ETA) for license-exempt wireless devices will now be granted on a self-declaration basis. This self-declaration process is expected to significantly reduce the time and effort required for approvals, benefiting companies looking to deploy wireless equipment in the Indian market, DoT said. The DoT said existing terms and conditions for experimental and demonstration licenses, will remain in effect, except for the updated timelines.
Additionally, ETA holders are reminded to obtain the necessary clearances, such as a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), before importing equipment into India.

telecom sector
forward, Communications Minister
Jyotiraditya Scindia
has identified 5-6 pillars including increased R&D in the sector, excellent quality of service (QoS), PLI in manufacturing, development of locally developed 4G stack etc.
Speaking to ET in an interview, the Minister said the telecom sector is at the cusp of a new revolution. “India, which was a follower in 3G, was marching along in 4G and 5G and today has the ability to lead the world in 6G,”
Scindia
said.
The Minister has identified 5-6 key agenda points to take the sector forward. It includes the 4G saturation across the country. There are close to 20,000-22,000 towers that need to be set up across the unconnected 10,000 villages in India. “That is something I am monitoring on a daily basis,” the Minister said.
Second priority is the 4G stack for BSNL. “What is remarkable is that India is the third or fourth country in the world to have its own 4G technology which means that the core, radio network and data centres are developed in-house,” Scindia said.
The Minister said development of 4G stack has allowed the country to not only take a leap forward in manufacturing but also a reservoir of foreign exchange. Further, Scindia said the government is also considering increasing the incentive for design-led manufacturing in India.
Live Events
“The PLI in telecom is a huge success. There are 42 companies in the scheme, which have invested close to Rs 4,000 crore with production to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore worth of exports,” he said.
Another key agenda for the Minister is to take care of QoS, which he believes should be excellent. Spam calls have to be minimised.
The Minister also said there should be more R&D in telecom and both global as well as Indian firms will be supported to do that.

Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation
(IBDF), Star India and
Viacom18
have challenged the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s regulation that mandates broadcasters to provide channels on
DD Free Dish
for free to private distribution platform operators (DPOs) also.
The matter will next be heard on September 4.
Broadcasters have argued that DD Free Dish can't be equated with other DPOs as it doesn't charge subscription from its consumers, whereas private DPOs collect subscription charges from their subscribers.
Trai
had amended the broadcast tariff regulation and introduced a condition that pay channels that are available on DD Free Dish must be made available to private DPOs on a free-to-air (FTA) basis.
Live Events
DPOs had petitioned Trai that broadcasters were discriminating against them by charging them for the same channels that were available on FTA basis on DD Free Dish.
ET had first reported that TV broadcasters plan to challenge the Trai directive to make pay channels on DD Free Dish free for other distributors.
In its petition, IBDF contended that Trai’s onerous conditions will lead to a drop in the reach of channels as broadcasters will either have to pull out their channels from DD Free Dish or make them FTA to other DPOs and be outside the pay channel bouquets.
Currently, over 15 pay channels across news and entertainment genres are present on DD Free Dish. However, entertainment channels have a nominal price as they air old content.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
TRAI

Terahertz band
(95GHz - 3THz frequency bands) to promote research and development, technology trials, and indoor and outdoor testing by Indian entities.
The telecom regulator has also recommended permitting authorisation and assignment-exempt operations in the 116-123 GHz, 174.8-182 GHz, 185-190 GHz, and 244-246
GHz frequency bands
in India.
Authorisation period should be five years, for a fee of Rs 1,000, Trai said.
These bands would support the introduction of next-generation wireless technologies that could be deployed both indoor and outdoor, and deliver increased capacity and reliability for existing and emerging use cases, Trai said.
Further it recommended opening up the 77-81 GHz frequency range for authorisation and assignment-exempt operations of automotive radar systems in India.

“The
TeraHertz Experimental Authorisation
(THEA), recommended by the Authority, would encourage entrepreneurs and academia to develop innovative new technologies and services in the
TeraHertz
band,” the regulatory body said in its recommendations after a round of consultations and an open-house discussion.
“THEA would help experimenters to evaluate the performance of products in the TeraHertz band in the conception, development and design stages which would, in turn, pave a path to ascertain the technical viability of technologies and services built on the TeraHertz spectrum,” Trai added.
Moreover, Trai said that any Indian entity including academic institutes, research labs, central and state government, public sector units, technology parks, telecom service providers, incubator and original equipment manufacturers are eligible to get authorisation to use the terahertz bands.
The telecom body has also recommended direct sale and marketing of experimental devices designed to operate in the

Plan to display caller name hits tech wall,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/plan-to-display-caller-name-hits-tech-wall/articleshow/112475652.cms,13-08-2024,"The telecom regulator’s ambitious plan to make name display compulsory for incoming calls appears to be stillborn due to tech-related obstacles.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (

) had in February asked telcos to ensure a calling name presentation (CNAP) service on mobile phones, a move aimed at combating spam and scam calls.
But senior executives of mobile phone operators and handset companies said the proposed service is almost impossible to implement nationally as it won’t work on 2G/3G networks unless huge sums are spent on network upgrades. And that is economically unviable, given the low revenue generation from

users.
This means the service cannot be offered to 270-300 million 2G users. In fact, only smartphones that have come into the market after 2021 are likely to support the CNAP feature, they added.
Executives added that even integrating the CNAP feature in 4G-5G smartphones would lead to a longer call-setup time, potentially spoiling customers’ overall call experience.

“Trai appears to have prematurely recommended the CNAP functionality on all mobiles by ignoring ground realities...this technology is not a universal solution, it doesn’t work on 2G/3G networks now and can’t be supported by feature phones either, which means it can only be offered selectively on 4G/5G networks, potentially depriving millions of 2G users across India of this service,” a senior executive of a Big 3 telco told ET.
In February, Trai had called on the government to mandate telcos to implement the
CNAP service
and even push handset OEMs to enable the feature in six months in a bid to reduce customer harassment from unknown/spam callers.
The telecom regulator had suggested that trials be conducted in one licence service area (LSA). Last week, minister of state for communications P Chandra Shekhar told Parliament that necessary steps had been taken by the government to start trials and assessment for implementing the CNAP service by telcos.
“Trials are on, but the regulator has been apprised that CNAP will only work on IP-based networks whereas the older circuit switched (CS) mobile networks are not evolved enough to support it. So in no way will this help entirely curb spam calls or fraud, but will instead be a drain on telco resources as significant costs would need to be incurred towards servers/separate storage of customer data specifically for CNAP,” said the first executive cited.
A second executive of another leading telco added that the CNAP facility would seriously undermine a mobile user’s calling experience if it is offered for calls between different 4G/5G networks. “This is since calls will take much longer to set up as the telco originating the call will need to access the CNAP subscriber database of the telco on whose network the call terminates to offer the caller identity display feature, and this process is unlikely to be smooth,” he added.
At press time, ET’s queries to Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi) remained unanswered. Queries to Trai also did not elicit a response.
Handset industry experts said there is no real urgency to mandate CNAP without taking cognisance of ground realities, especially since there are enough mobile apps that already fulfil the objective of knowing the name of the caller, to make an informed decision about accepting or rejecting a call.
“A major challenge in implementing the CNAP functionality is that feature phones, as in 2G devices, cannot support it. While 4G/5G smartphones will be able to support it, it’s likely to require software updates. This makes it virtually impossible for telecom operators to offer the CNAP facility to all mobile users,” Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), told ET.
Industry executives also cited potential challenges around customer privacy violation if the CNAP service is mandated nationally. According to them, since mobile subscriber data is, typically, confidential information, there would be some mobile users who may be averse to sharing their names. “If a database solution involving a third party is implemented, then there could be a possibility of data leakages due to availability of data with foreign OS/handset makers/application providers, which could trigger customer relationship issues for operators,” said another executive.
Trai, on its part, has suggested that the 140-number series allocated for businesses and telemarketers for making calls to subscribers should also display the name of the calling entity.
It has also called on the telecom department to formulate rules on documentation to be provided by subscriber entities holding bulk connections and business connections for registering their preferred name with telcos.

"New service quality rules tough, will hike cost burden: Telcos",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telcos-concerned-about-trais-new-stringent-quality-norms/articleshow/112263088.cms,05-08-2024,"Telcos
have termed the new service quality rules set by the regulator would increase their cost and compliance burden and plan to raise the issue with telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia soon, executives aware of the details told ET.
The industry, in a separate statement, said no regulator in similar economies have introduced such norms. The telcos stressed that while the rules will entail a cost burden on them, benefits on consumers won’t be great.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) announced new parameters to measure
quality of service
(QoS) for telecommunications on Friday and the rules will come into effect from October 1.
The regulator not only made the rules more stringent but also incorporated provisions that will mandate telcos to compensate consumers in case the network outage is not resolved in a particular time frame. Financial penalties have also been increased, while the reporting around performance has to be done on a monthly basis and at a cell level. Currently, telcos report on a quarterly basis and till a base station level.
“The firms will take up the QoS matter with the minister in their second round of meeting. There are certain things which are not in control of telcos, and the minister will be apprised about the matter holistically,” an executive said.

Trai tightens quality norms around 4G and 5G networks
Another executive said the industry will also engage with Trai in highlighting the pain points. During the meetings with Trai officials, which followed a consultation process on the matter, the industry had pointed out the difficulties in meeting the new parameters, which weren’t accepted by the sectoral watchdog.
“While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with Trai on QoS-related matters,” the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said in its statement. The body represents all the three private
telecom operators
–Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea.
The association said the QoS parameters prescribed in the new regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. “These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers,” said SP Kochhar, director general, COAI.
As per Trai, in case of a network outage in a district for mobile services for more than 24 hours, telcos will need to provide a rebate on rent for postpaid customers and extend the validity of connection for pre-paid customers by equal number of affected days.

Trai's new norms mandate telcos to compensate users for service outages, raise penal amount
For fixed-line services, users will have to be compensated if the fault in their network or service is repaired after three days.
The telcos said while Trai has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. For instance, telcos said they still grapple with right of way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fibre optic cables.
“The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks,” the COAI said.
Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. “TSPs (telecom service providers) have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the quality of services,” the industry body highlighted.

4G
and
5G
networks, increased the financial penalties for not meeting benchmarks and directed telcos to compensate mobile phone users with rent rebates and validity extensions in case mobile service outages continue for more than 24 hours, in a bid to reduce instances of call drops and slow network downtime problems.
To achieve time bound action on quality of service (QoS) related issues, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) Friday increased the financial penalty to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 earlier for not meeting the benchmarks. The regulator has also introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations under revised regulations, which will come into effect from October 1.
For the first time, the Trai notified QoS benchmarks for 5G services as the technology was launched in October 2022 in India.
The new parameters that Trai released will be used to measure quality of fixed, wireless and broadband services to reduce instances of call drops and improve quality of telecommunication services for consumers.
As per Trai, in case of a network outage in a district for mobile services for more than 24 hours, telcos will need to provide a rebate on rent for postpaid customers and extend the validity of connection for pre-paid customers by equal number of affected days,

“To account for the quality aspects arising out of large-scale penetration of new and emerging technologies such as 4G and 5G and high-speed broadband services on fibre, the authority decided to carry out an extensive review of the existing regulations and put forward a comprehensive regulatory framework which encompasses QoS benchmarks for all three services at one place,” Trai said in a statement.
Trai had earlier issued three different regulations for
QoS norms
for basic and cellular services, broadband services, and broadband wireless services. The new regulations will supersede the three regulations.
The three regulations were notified more than a decade ago and technology landscape of telecom networks have changed completely now with converged networks.
To account for that, the Authority has tightened benchmarks for some key parameters like network availability (cumulative downtime and worst affected cells due to downtime), call drop rate, packet drop rate and latency. Certain benchmarks related to packet drop rate, latency, download and upload speed have been changed from average to percentile to have a better understanding.
For insights into network performances at a granular level, Trai has decided to collect performance data against certain parameters like network availability, call drop, voice packet drop rate etc on cell level as against base station level earlier.
The quality of service (QoS) performance of mobile service shall now be monitored on a monthly instead of quarterly basis. However, since the telecom industry was opposing the move to have monthly sharing of data, Trai has given six months to telcos for a smooth transition from the effective date of the regulation.
Similarly various other benchmarks, including related to call drops, packet drop rate, latency parameters for 4G/5G networks etc, will come into effect from six months to two and a half years.
“We understand the limitations of telcos and that is why we have given a glide path of six months to two and a half years to telecom operators for smooth transition and upgradation of their networks,” an official said.
The new rules mandate service providers to display technology (2G/ 3G/ G/ 5G) wise mobile coverage maps on their website for consumers to make informed decisions. The telcos will also have to publish QoS performance against prescribed parameters on their website.
In addition to the requirement for display of mobile coverage maps, new parameters like reporting of significant network outages, jitter, maximum bandwidth utilization between radio and core network during busy hours, and SMS delivery success rate have been introduced.
To achieve time bound action on QoS related issues and early resolution of non-compliant QoS performance in the network, graded financial disincentives, increasing with continued non-compliance, have been introduced for all services.
“This will enable identification of pockets of degraded QoS performance for corrective action by service providers,” Trai said.

"DTH, teleport company expect new policy to lower satellite costs",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dth-teleport-company-expect-new-policy-to-lower-satellite-costs/articleshow/112176364.cms,01-08-2024,"Direct-to-home (DTH) and
teleport operators
are expecting
satellite capacity costs
to fall after the government’s policy of mandating
foreign satellite operators
to set up local units if they want to provide satellite capacity to
Indian companies
from April 2025.
Experts said the move will allow
broadcasting service providers
to ink long-term deals with foreign satellite operators, besides enabling them to sign contracts in Indian rupee (INR) instead of foreign currencies like the US dollar.
Some of the key foreign satellite operators that provide satellite services to TV broadcasters and
DTH operators
in India include SES, AsiaSat, Intelsat, and Measat, among others.
SES
already has an India subsidiary, SES Satellites India.
Foreign satellite companies that don’t have an India subsidiary are expected to incorporate local units in the country, as the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) has stated that only satellites authorised by the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (
IN-SPACe
) can provide space-based communication and broadcast services in India from April 2025.
“We can sign
long-term contracts
till the end of the life of these satellites (typically 5-10 years), whereas ISRO was allowing only leases for 1-2 years at a time,” said
Dish TV India
CEO Manoj Dobhal, adding that longer-term deals will be commercially more lucrative.
Live Events
“It may be possible to sign contracts in INR instead of foreign currencies and avoid escalating prices. In fact, we expect the prices to be competitive with Indian National Satellite System capacity,” he added.
Sanjay Duda, the CEO of Planetcast Media Services, India’s largest teleport operator, said the new policy will enable companies to buy capacity in India directly from the Indian entities of foreign satellite operators.
“As a teleport operator, we will be able to trade in INR, due to which we don't have to do foreign exchange payments, which is a big positive for the industry. We will not have to go through that whole process of seeking permissions for foreign exchange,” he added.
Duda also said the 5% commission paid by DTH operators to NSIL for provisioning of Ku-band transponders will go away. TV broadcasters didn’t have to pay any commission as they could directly lease C-band capacity from foreign satellite companies.
“Previously all capacities were being channelled via NSIL, which in reality was not doing any price negotiations but simply passing the vendor-provided pricing to users and charging a commission of 5%,” he added.
A senior TV broadcasting official said the benefits for TV channels will be smaller compared to DTH operators, who require massive transponder capacities to provide TV channels in multiple genres and languages.
In an advisory dated July 10, the MIB said that foreign satellite operators will need IN-SPACe authorisation through their India units to provide satellite services to their Indian customers. Existing arrangements between foreign satellite operators and their Indian customers can continue till March 31, 2025.
Set up by the Department of Space in 2020, IN-SPACe is an autonomous nodal agency that encourages non-government entities (NGE) to undertake space activities. Previously, the foreign satellite capacity was being channelled through NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), a public sector undertaking under DoS.

Trai recalls 2015 proposal on adjusted gross revenue math,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-recalls-proposal-on-minimum-presumptive-agr/articleshow/112136819.cms,31-07-2024,"New Delhi: The telecom sector regulator has withdrawn its 2015 recommendation that telcos need not pay licence fee and
spectrum charges
on minimum presumptive adjusted gross revenue (
AGR
), a move that may have financial implications for
Reliance Communications
(RCom) and
Aircel
, which are currently in insolvency.
The companies, which are operational like Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea, pay dues on their actual AGR. But non-functional firms like Aircel and RCom are supposed to pay based on
presumptive AGR
, which is 5% of the bid amount of spectrum auction.
Since the government was yet to accept the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
’s 2015 recommendations, both the companies are supposed to have been paying their regulatory dues, either in full or in part. But the move by
Trai
has closed the matter now, dashing any hopes that the two bankrupt carriers may have had of not having to pay these regulatory levies.
“Both the companies, currently in insolvency, have to pay the regulatory dues as required by the licence conditions. There have been instances when the entire dues were not paid and the firms have defaulted, and the amount will add on to the liabilities to these firms,” a government official told ET, asking not to be named.
However, another unnamed official said the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) can’t take any coercive action against the companies till the matter is resolved in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

“The outstanding amount keeps on accumulating and finally, when the resolution happens, the dues will be paid accordingly to all creditors,” the second official said.
Since the companies continue to retain spectrum, which is a sovereign resource, the DoT had challenged the NCLT order, which stated that airwaves, being an intangible asset of the licensee, can be subjected to insolvency proceedings.
In fact, it was because of the introduction of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) 2016 and the ongoing proceedings in case of RCom and Aircel that the DoT had asked Trai to reconsider its AGR recommendations in November 2022, said officials.
The DoT had highlighted to Trai that spectrum has been made part of insolvency proceedings under IBC and spectrum allotted to insolvent companies was lying idle as they hadn’t returned the airwaves to the DoT. Further, these companies pay SUC on the presumptive AGR basis.
Moreover, as per the NCLT order, dues of central government as well as deferred or default payment instalments of spectrum acquisition cost fall within the ambit of operational dues under the IBC, below the financial creditors like banks etc.
The DoT stressed that presumptive AGR provides protection to government for dues emanating from use of spectrum by companies that may go into insolvency i.e government gets SUC payments while a company is undergoing insolvency proceedings.
Reverting to the DoT reference and taking into consideration the points raised by DoT, the authority had said it is of the view that the recommendation that the minimum presumptive AGR for the purpose of LF and SUC should not be made applicable to any licence(s) granted by government for providing telecom services, is not relevant in today’s scenario.
“Hence, the authority withdraws its recommendation no. 3.8 of the Trai’s recommendations on ‘Definition of Revenue Base (AGR) for the Reckoning of License Fee and Spectrum Usage Charges’ dated January 6, 2015,” Trai said in its response to DoT on July 23, 2024. Accordingly, the issues raised in DoT’s back-reference are no longer relevant, the authority added.

The ministry said the draft guidelines aim to address unregistered marketers using private numbers, which remain unregulated despite TRAI's 2018 rules for registered
telemarketers
.
The ministry also stated that while the 'Do Not Disturb' registry has been effective for registered telemarketers, communications from unregistered sources remain unchecked.
The draft guidelines seek to protect consumers from invasive and unauthorised marketing, according to the statement.

"Budget 2024: Upcoming 4G, 5G network roll outs to get costlier with customs duty hike",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/upcoming-4g-5g-network-roll-outs-to-get-costlier-with-customs-duty-hike/articleshow/111959503.cms,24-07-2024,"Upcoming
4G
and
5G
network rollouts are set to get costlier with finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
proposing a 5% increase in the basic customs duty (BCD) of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) to 15% in Budget 2024-25.
This is since nearly 80% of PCBAs — a vital telecom gear input - used in ubiquitous network equipment such as mobile base stations are imported, while the dependence on imported PCBAs used in optical fibre network gear, mobile switching centres (MSCs) and routers too is over 50%, say senior industry executives.
In the immediate term, though, experts expect
Vodafone Idea
(Vi) to face the brunt of the impact as the loss-making telco is yet to roll out 5G networks and is also in the process of ramping up its 4G coverage in priority circles to compete more effectively with bigger rivals Reliance Jio and
Bharti Airtel
.
India’s top two telcos, Jio and Airtel, are unlikely to be impacted in the near-term as they have concluded their countrywide 5G rollouts.
“Network rollout costs will rise by around 4-5% once the higher BCD is passed on to the client as the dependence on imported PCBAs for manufacturing base stations, OFC gear, routers to switches is still pretty high, ranging from 50-80%,” a top executive of a top global networks vendor told ET.

Budget 2024: Local telecom gear manufacturing to get a boost with customs duty hike
At press time, queries to the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents telcos such Airtel, Jio and Vi, went unanswered. Queries to Vi also did not elicit a response.
Homegrown telecom gear makers, though, are upbeat as higher customs duty is slated to give a fillip to local production of PCBAs as it will make imports of this vital network gear input costlier.
The PCBA is arguably amongst the most critical inputs for manufacturing all kinds of telecom network gear, from base stations, routers, OFC gear, switches, exchanges to transmission equipment and customer premises equipment (CPE). It’s essentially the finished board after all sub-components have been soldered and installed on a printed circuit board (PCB).
The likes of contract manufacturers
Dixon Technologies
and Optiemus Electronics, who already locally manufacture bulk of the PCBAs that are used in a range of CPEs such as routers, fixed wireless devices to Android-bashed set-top-boxes, say the BCD move will further boost manufacturing in the country.

“The proposed increase in the basic customs duty for PCBAs will further boost their local production, minimise import dependence, and eventually help create a robust telecom equipment manufacturing ecosystem in India,” said Atul Lall, managing director, Dixon Technologies. Currently, over 70% of the PCBAs used in telecom CPEs are made in India, with the rest imported.
N K Goyal, chairman emeritus, Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (TEMA), said a higher customs duty would “ rightly discourage imports” as India has adequate domestic manufacturing capability/capacity of PCBAs and can be self-reliant.
Local telecom gear makers added that a gradual step-up in local PCBA production is also likely to eventually reduce the final price of telecom network equipment over time once there are adequate economies of scale.

The provisions are part of the
draft adjudication
and
appeal rules
notified under the
Telecommunications Act
. The rules will come into force after 30 days.
As part of the rules, the government has also notified a mechanism whereby any entity can voluntarily disclose the

voluntary undertaking
, no action shall be taken to the extent of non-compliance.
Any entity can submit a voluntary undertaking, even after an inquiry has been initiated by the adjudication officer.
However, if an entity or assignee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of a voluntary undertaking accepted by the adjudicating officer, action can be taken. As per the draft rules, any person aggrieved by an order of the adjudicating officer may appeal to the
designated appeals committee
within a period of 30 days, along with a copy of the order against which the appeal is sought. The appeal shall be accompanied by a fee of Rs 10,000.

The
Central Government
may notify a portal for the digital implementation of these rules, including for submission of complaints, appeals, voluntary undertakings, notices, publications of orders, hearings by virtual mode etc.
The government can appoint one or more adjudication officers, as it may deem fit, who must be Central government employees, and each officer shall have a secretariat to assist in its functioning.
Apart from the adjudication officers, there will be a designated appeals committee, for which Central government employees will be appointed as members. Like the adjudication officers, each committee shall have a secretariat to assist in its functioning.
As per the draft rules, the adjudicating officer shall normally conclude the inquiry within 90 calendar days from the date of issuance of the notice. In certain cases, the period can be extended to 120 days.

Budget 2024: Telecom sector seeks policy reforms and legal clarity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/budget-2024-telecom-sector-budget-expectations-custom-duty-changes-in-budget-telecom-sector-seeks-policy-reforms-and-legal-clarity/articleshow/111854163.cms,19-07-2024,"Union Budget
: With the
Budget 2024
just around the corner, anticipations are rife. In the Interim
Budget
2024-25, the Hon'ble Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, had emphasised that the forthcoming five years are poised to witness unprecedented development to realise the vision of a developed India by 2047. Undoubtedly, technology – steered by the
telecom sector
, shall be a crucial catalyst in this transformative journey.
Telecom Industry's Budget Wishlist
The Telecom Industry is thus hoping for some radical policy reforms to ensure its growth in tandem to the economy.
The Apex Court recently delivered a landmark decision on tax deductibility of variable license fee, reversing over a decade old decision of the Delhi High Court and unsettling an even older Industry practice of claiming the said expenditure as a revenue expenditure. The Apex Count has held that such license fee should be amortised over the tenure of the license. Respecting the ruling of the Apex Court and given that the aforesaid expense is an annual charge payable basis annual revenues, the Industry is hoping that prospectively, such expenses will be allowed as a revenue expense by introduction of a specific amendment in the law.
Budget Clarifications Sought by Industry
Additionally, while the Apex Court has provided that no interest would be charged on the tax liability that may arise as a result of the aforesaid ruling, there may be practical issues/ambiguities in such interest waiver, and hence a specific clarification for waiver of such interest together with penalty, would assist in ensuring that no fresh litigation arises in relation to this issue.

Union Budget: What lies ahead in Budget 2024 for indirect taxes?
Despite retrospective amendment introduced in the year 2012, in the definition of ‘royalty’ to include charges for transmission by satellite, cable, optic fibre, etc., the Courts in India have consistently held that these charges do not take the character of royalty in the hands of the foreign telecom operators, particularly under the applicable tax treaties.
Budget Expectations for Customs Duty
To bring closure of the multiple litigations which are in progress, both for recovery of principal tax, both from the foreign telecom operators and the Indian payer, as also denial of deduction in the hands of the Indian payers, the Industry seeks a clarification to the effect that the amendment is subservient to the tax treaties and shall not be applicable on payments made to foreign telecom operators from countries with whom Indian has signed tax treaties.
From an indirect tax perspective, one of the key asks of the Industry has been waiver of customs duty import of 4G and 5G network equipment. Increased rates of custom duties on telecommunication equipment casts a substantial dent on the cost sheets of the industry players. Though, increasing the custom duties was a step towards Government’s vision to foster ‘Make in India’ initiative, however, the absence of domestic alternative, presently, leaves them with no option but to import this equipment at a higher cost.
Classification disputes are on a rise. Notices have been issued to various telecom equipment suppliers disputing the classification of imported products. The same is due to the ambiguity with respect to classification and exemption available to various parts / products specifically those falling under tariff heading 85176290 and 85176990. As has been the global practice, these tariff headings should be broken down into subheadings to clearly lay down goods included in each subheading. The sector is hoping for requisite clarifications in the Budget 2024 to stop unsolicited disputes on this account.

Industry Hopes from Budget 2024
Recently, the Communications minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia while addressing the media, post holdings meetings with telecom department’s six advisory committees consisting of industry stakeholders, mentioned that the Government has identified the agenda and pain points of the Telecom sector and would dedicatedly work on addressing them. The industry expects some decisive steps being taken in this direction in the Budget 2024.
Success of India’s Telecom PLI scheme has been astounding. With creation of jobs, reduction in imports and increasing exports, the scheme facilitated in making India a global production hub. The industry anticipates the introduction of Telecom 3.0 for both current and prospective applicants. The same is being planned by government to boost exports and incorporate MSMEs into the manufacturing system. Further, such a development is eagerly sought by applicants having reached the upper limits of the existing PLI thresholds, and now desiring incentives for incremental sales.
India's satcom sector companies are also seeking introduction of PLI schemes for space-grade components to incentivise domestic manufacturing. Satcom services are the next big step further connecting the country.
To facilitate ease of doing business and unburden the industry from stringent compliances - centralized audit and investigation under GST for ‘PAN India’ telecom operators, as well as reducing the working capital burden by releasing the blocked credits, has been again a long-standing request. Industry is expecting some proposals in Budget 2024 in this direction.

“We have notified the Act late last month and I commit to you that within 180 days, which is our deadline, we will have each and every rule notified so that all of you can walk down that path with complete confidence with the government by your side,” Scindia said.
Commenting on BSNL, which is rolling out 4G networks based on locally developed technology, Scindia said it would have been very easy for the telco to use technology developed by others. But it chose the hard path to pick up a technology that has been developed in India. “...India must not only be the supplier of services, but we must become the supplier of products.""

The minister further added, “The view should be...we have great pride that India has developed its own 4G stack. We can't wait for our phones to adopt that domestic technology.”
The India Mobile Congress will be organised by the government and telecom industry, represented by the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), from October 15 to18.
Touching upon the ease of doing business in the communications sector, Scindia said the government is now working as a facilitator for the industry. “...the communications ministry is not only committed to a transparent process, but I believe the time has come that the Government has moved from the role of being a regulator to the role of a facilitator, because in your success lies our success and lies our country’s success,” he added.

Govt mulls handing over MTNL operations to BSNL; merger unlikely,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/govt-mulls-handing-over-mtnl-operations-to-bsnl-merger-unlikely/articleshow/111708794.cms,13-07-2024,"New Delhi: The

is considering the option of handing over
operations
of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (
MTNL
) to
BSNL
through an agreement, instead of pursuing a
merger
route, a source privy to the development said. A final call on this is likely to be taken in a month's time.
The source said the option of handing over
debt-laden
MTNL's operations to
Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd
(BSNL) through an agreement is being looked into. The source said that given MTNL's high debt, a merger with BSNL was not a favourable option.
Once the decision is taken, the proposal would be placed before the Committee of Secretaries, and thereafter taken to the Cabinet.
Amid mounting financial woes, MTNL this week informed in a statutory filing that it is unable to make interest
payment
to certain bondholders ""due to insufficient funds"".
""The second semi annual interest with regard to 7.59 per cent MTNL's bond series...is due on July 20, 2024. As per the structured payment mechanism of Tripartite agreement (TPA) signed among MTNL, Department of Telecom and Beacon Trusteeship Ltd, MTNL has to fund the semi-annual interest into the Escrow account with adequate amount 10 days before the due date,"" it said.

In view of the provisions of TPA, it is informed that due to insufficient funds, MTNL could not fund the Escrow account with adequate amount, the corporation said in the BSE filing.
While MTNL offers services in Delhi and Mumbai, BSNL runs all India operations (except Delhi and Mumbai).
Even as private telcos like Reliance Jio and
Bharti Airtel
have scaled their subscriber tally in past months capitalising on Indian users' massive appetite for data and voice services, the customer base of MTNL has been dwindling - from just 4.66 million (wireless and wireline) in January-March 2023 to 4.1 million a year later.
MTNL's losses mounted to Rs 3,267.5 crore in FY24 from Rs 2,915.1 crore in FY23.
Revenue from operations in last fiscal year was Rs 798.56 crore, down 14.6 per cent from a year ago.

Eligibility criteria eased to woo top talent for Trai leadership,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/eligibility-criteria-eased-to-woo-top-talent-for-trai-leadership/articleshow/111560098.cms,08-07-2024,"NEW DELHI: The Central government has relaxed eligibility conditions for appointing chairman and members of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) as it aims to draw top talent for the long-pending
leadership vacancies
.
With the notification of the Telecommunications Act 2023, it will be much easier now for senior government officials, who are not IAS (Indian Administrative Services) officers, to become the chairman or a member at Trai.
Earlier, the conditions were too stringent, which made it difficult to find good candidates for the post of member, leading to the post remaining vacant for long periods, say experts. As per the Trai website, all the posts of members (two full time and two part-time) are still vacant.
Only the chairman and members at the authority are entitled to take decisions, underlining the criticality of the positions.
As per the earlier conditions, to become a member at Trai, a person needed to serve as additional secretary or any equivalent post for not less than three years. But by the time most ITS (
Indian telecom service
) officers or other non-IAS officials reach this stage, they are nearing retirement with only around 6-8 months at the post, making them ineligible. But now the condition to serve a minimum three year as additional secretary or any equivalent post has been removed.

""It will be very good because in the previous clause, several telecom professionals who are either in
BSNL
, Trai,
CDoT
,
TCIL
etc were not able to apply... Now they will get a chance to become a member or chairman of Trai,""
Sudhir Gupta
, former Trai secretary, told ET.
The section 59 (b) of the Telecommunications Act, which has come into effect from July 5, streamlines the hiring for the posts of chairman and member of Trai. It clearly lays out conditions for government employees and private sector professionals to apply for the posts.
While there was no bar on hiring from the private sector earlier also, the conditions were ambiguous, leading to negligible hiring from outside the government machinery. While the members of Trai have been all government servants, the chairman post was largely dominated by IAS officers.
Anil Kumar Lahoti, the current chairman, is the only third non-IAS to be appointed as chairman of the telecom regulator, since its inception in 1997.

TRAI may offer some leeway on service quality rules to telcos,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-may-offer-some-leeway-on-service-quality-rules-to-telcos/articleshow/111522492.cms,06-07-2024,"New Delhi: The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
TRAI
) is likely to relax some of the parameters in the proposed quality of service (
QoS
) rules that have been termed too stringent to meet by the industry. The regulator though has stressed that
telecom
operators must improve service quality, especially on the back of the recent
tariff hikes
.
""The
telcos
have submitted their comments on the draft
regulations
during the consultation process. We are aware of the challenges and the final rules would likely address issues raised by the telcos,"" a senior official said, asking not to be named.
The regulator is likely to issue the final rules in a month or so after taking account of the industry concerns, officials added.
ET Bureau
TRAI in August last year proposed strict performance benchmarks for service providers, seeking to eliminate instances of call drops and setting separate yardsticks for 5G services to help improve the consumer experience.

In the proposed regulations on quality of service for wireless, wireline and broadband services, TRAI had incorporated additional parameters for reporting while seeking data at a granular level on a monthly basis. The guidelines around call drops, coverage, network downtown, latency parameters for broadband services, etc., were made more stringent.
Telcos have cited technical challenges to providing such a large quantum of data, while seeking to continue with the existing regulations on QoS. They have submitted their written comments on the draft regulations and also highlighted their issues in an open house discussion on the matter.
The challenges were again highlighted in a meeting held Thursday between the telcos and Trai officials to find a consensus on the issue. The regulator, though, made it clear that QoS should be improved as consumers should not suffer.
""There is no need to massively overhaul the QoS regulations. There should be a light-touch regulatory framework and QoS can also be analysed based on third-party apps data,"" an executive present during the meeting told ET.
In the latest meeting, the industry stressed that the dropped call rate (DCR) parameter should be technology agnostic and shouldn’t be specific to 2G/3G and 4G/5G, as it can lead to a telco becoming perpetual non-compliant, another industry executives present in the meeting told ET.
The regulator had proposed technology-specific reporting for call drops – one to assess the 2G/3G networks and another for 4G/5G. The parameter to assess the 4G/5G networks was more stringent.
Similarly for broadband services, since the LTE (4G) and 5G networks support low latency, the QoS benchmark for the latency parameter was proposed to be less than 100 milliseconds (ms) from 250 ms, which was prescribed in 2012.
Also, Trai has proposed revising the benchmark of network downtime to a cell level in place of the current base station (BTS) level, to have a granular view of network availability.
However, as per an industry executive, currently customers are served through multiple cells of the same BTS or of different base stations. It does not mean that if a cell is down, the customer is not getting services.
The telcos have also opposed sharing of data on a monthly basis as against quarterly in the current regime.
On submission of data state-wise, the telcos highlighted that it would be difficult because different jurisdictions are involved for different licensed service areas. Further, there will be difficulties in aggregation and coordination of data as it will require a new ID system to be set up that will entail cost and time, another industry executive present at the meeting said.

(Trai) Friday said the amendments to mobile number portability (MNP) regulations to curb
SIM swap

replacement frauds
will come into effect from July 1.
""The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), on 14th March, 2024, issued the
Telecommunication Mobile Number Portability
(Ninth amendment) Regulations, 2024, which will come into force on 1st July, 2024,"" TRAI said.
The regulator had notified the amendment in March 2024, after consulting stakeholders. The amendment adds an additional criterion for rejecting generation of the Unique Porting Code (
UPC
) required to port a SIM card to a different telecom service provider.
""These amendment regulations are aimed at curbing the porting of mobile numbers by way of fraudulent SIM swap/ replacement by unscrupulous elements,"" the regulator said Friday.
Under the amendment, Trai said a UPC shall not be allocated if the request for the UPC has been made before the expiry of seven days from the date of SIM swap/ replacement.

Stakeholders opined to TRAI that rejecting UPC for mobile numbers that recently underwent SIM swap or replacement will prevent porting of mobile connections soon after swap/replacement by fraudsters, common practice after committing a fraudulent call.
""For implementing the additional criterion for rejection of the request for allocation of UPC introduced through these amendment regulations, modifications would have to be carried out in the
telecommunication systems
and processes of access providers and MNP service providers, which will be followed by testing of the scenarios before the pan-India implementation,"" Trai said in its explanatory memo in the March amendment notification.

Trai
) to recommend the terms and conditions for the authorisation mechanism to be followed to regulate the industry, as it looks to abolish the licensing regime.
The
Department of Telecommunications
has asked Trai to share its recommendations preferably in 60 days as it looks to act swiftly on the matter, said officials.
“Trai met the
telecom operators
and internet service providers today (Thursday) to seek their inputs on the authorisation structure. The players can provide their comments by early next week, following which Trai will issue a consultation paper,” an official told ET on condition of anonymity.
The Telecommunications Act
, which came into force on June 26, calls for a simple regulatory framework by abolishing the license regime and replacing it with an authorisation mechanism.
The authorisation mechanism will be applicable to all kinds of telecom services and will include telecom operators,
satellite operators
as well as internet service providers. While Trai will recommend terms and conditions for the authorisation mechanism, modalities around spectrum allocation will be defined separately.

The government has yet to send a reference to Trai regarding the satellite spectrum for seeking pricing and other modalities for administrative allocation of the airwaves.
Certain provisions and sections of the new Act have been notified while the remaining will be implemented in the coming 180 days. “All existing provisions and rules will continue unless repugnant to these sections,” the official said.
“With the new Act already in place, the government has to notify all the rules and regulations within 180 days, otherwise it will have to seek extension from Parliament,” said another official.
There are 11 chapters and 62 sections in the new law, which replaces the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Act, 1933. Statutory rules and regulations need to be framed within six months from the date of notification of a clause. Rules are required for 23 sections and 35 sub-sections – as per Section 56 of the Act. Rules are not required for 39 sections.
The government needs to define related spectrum allotment, including satellite communications, interception of calls and messages as well as collection of biometric data, for which the processes need to be defined.
As per the officials, spectrum allotted administratively for satellite services is meant only for point-to-point connection and not for direct transmission of services to retail consumers. The rules are expected to define the exact conditions for satellite spectrum usage.
Companies such as Eutelsat Oneweb, Elon Musk-owned Starlink, Amazon Kuiper and Reliance Jio’s satcom joint venture with SES are to be given spectrum administratively as part of their global mobile personal communication by satellite services licences.

Know all about the Telecom Act which came into effect on June 26,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/know-all-about-the-telecom-act-which-comes-into-effect-on-june-26/articleshow/111295242.cms,27-06-2024,"The Telecommunications Act 2023
, along with certain provisions, came into force on June 26. The Act that replaces earlier laws governing the sector has been enacted to keep pace with emerging technologies. Several countries including the US, UK and Singapore have updated their legislation to deal with innovation in the telecom sector.
Process To Frame The Act: The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) initiated the process in July 2022 and a draft Bill was put out for consultation in September that year. During the consultation process, 60 ministries, 35 associations, 89 companies including seven telcos and internet service providers, and over 700 other entities responded. The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 18, 2023, and was passed by the Lower House of Parliament on December 20, 2023 and the Rajya Sabha on the following day. It received the assent of the President on December 24, 2023, and has now become the Telecommunications Act, 2023.
Why was a new law required
Nature of telecommunications, its usage and technologies have undergone massive changes. Old definitions and nomenclatures required updating. There were no provisions for the mode of spectrum allocation while provisions for right of way were weak. Poor and complex regulation used to affect ease of doing business and penalties for offences and noncompliance were not effective.

The sale may conclude in a couple of days amid muted bidding and the proceeds could be much lower than during the previous auction in 2022, according to sector experts, when the government netted a record Rs 1.5 lakh crore through an exercise that lasted seven days.
About 10.5 GHz of 5G airwaves in eight bands — 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3.3 GHz and 26 GHz — will be put on sale.
The government may net around Rs 10,000 crore, according to some experts, whereas another section pegged the bids at Rs 20,000-25,000 crore considering the three operators can bid for airwaves worth Rs 52,000 crore based on the earnest money deposited by them.
“The upcoming spectrum auction is expected to be muted as most operators have adequate 5G spectrum. The focus is likely to be on the renewal spectrum in select circles. However, considering that operators can bid for over Rs 52,000 crore basis the EMD (earnest money deposited), the auction could generate Rs 20,000-25,000 crore,” Prashant Singhal, EY Global TMT emerging markets leader, told ET.

“We don’t expect a significant demand from the telecom firms for the spectrum auction. It is going to be a short auction with Airtel and Vodafone Idea renewing their holdings,” said Rohan Dhamija, head (India & Middle East) at Analysys Mason.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are likely to only renew their holdings in specific bands or buy some additional spectrum. Reliance Jio is not facing any renewals, but it may buy some spectrum in 1800 MHz band to strengthen its holding, said analysts.
Analysts expect Bharti Airtel to be the biggest spender in the upcoming sale. The company faces renewals in six circles — Assam, Bihar, J&K, Odisha, UP East and West Bengal. Vodafone Idea is expected to renew its spectrum holdings in West Bengal and UP West.
The telcos may selectively bid for the airwaves, said Purushothaman KG, head of technology transformation and telecom at KPMG India. “Key factors that have a bearing on the decisions include the base price of the band, the interest rates and mode of payment (considering higher interest rates for deferred payments) and strategy to roll out 5G based on the current status of implementation and success of the rollouts,” he said.

Some analysts said that with Jio submitting almost three times the earnest money that of Bharti Airtel and 10 times that of Vodafone Idea, the market leader may try to grab airwaves, especially in those circles where rivals have to renew permits to continue offering seamless services, raising the prospect of some bidding wars.
In the 5G auction in 2022, Bharti Airtel had to renew airwaves in UP (East) but faced a bidding war with both Jio and Vodafone Idea for the 1800 MHz band, which pushed the winning price to 76% higher than the base price. However, apart from select circles, there is not likely to be much interest from the telecom firms this time, said analysts.

"Telecom Act 2023 based on principles of inclusion, growth, responsiveness for developed India",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telecom-act-2023-based-on-principles-of-inclusion-growth-responsiveness-for-developed-india/articleshow/111194835.cms,22-06-2024,"New Delhi: The
Telecommunications Act 2023
, which will be implemented partially from June 26, is based on principles of inclusion, security, growth and responsiveness to achieve the vision of
developed India
, an official statement said on Saturday. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, was passed by Parliament in December 2023. It received the President's assent on December 24, 2023 and was notified the same day.
""Guided by the principles of Samavesh (Inclusion), Suraksha (Security), Vriddhi (Growth), and Tvarit (Responsiveness), the Act aims to achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat (Developed India),"" the statement said.
The rules that will be effective from June 26, will allow the government to take over the control and management of any or all of any telecommunication services or network, in the interest of
national security
, friendly relations with foreign states, or in the event of war.
With these new rules in place, the universal service obligation fund will become
Digital Bharat Nidhi
, which can be used for funding research and development, and pilot projects instead of just supporting the establishment of telecom services in rural areas.
The new rules add a mandate of protecting users from spam and malicious communications.

""The Telecommunications Act, 2023 aims to amend and consolidate the law relating to development, expansion and operation of telecommunication services and telecommunication networks; assignment of spectrum and for matters connected therewith.
""The Telecommunications Act, 2023 also seeks to repeal existing legislative frameworks like Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and Indian Wireless Telegraph Act, 1933 owing to huge technical advancements in the telecom sector and technologies,"" the statement said.
The implementation of these sections paves the way for the enforcement of non-discriminatory and non-exclusive grants of right of way for telecom network roll-out and provides power to the central government to establish common ducts and cable corridors.

Officials told ET that the new Telecommunications Act and these sections have come into force. “All existing provisions and rules continue unless repugnant to these sections,” a top official said.
“The Telecommunications Act 2023 comes into force on 26th June 2024 replacing 150 year old Indian Telegraph Act as per notification,” telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal posted on social messaging platform X. But section 3-9 of the Act relates to powers of authorisation and assignment including that of telecommunication services, telecommunication network or radio equipment and spectrum.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is expected to soon send a reference to the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) for seeking pricing and other modalities for administrative allocation of satellite spectrum. The DoT also has to work on rules for various other provisions.

Centre puts guidelines for curbing pesky call menace in public domain; invites comments,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/centre-puts-guidelines-for-curbing-pesky-call-menace-in-public-domain-invites-comments/articleshow/111140882.cms,21-06-2024,"The Centre has classified
pesky calls
and other modes of unsolicited commercial communication as unfair trade practice in its newly released
guidelines
which seek to check the menace of such communication.
The guidelines, which were released on Thursday, will put accountability on
telemarketers
and their principal entities — such as banks, real estate companies or any other consumer-facing business — while sending promotional or transactional messages or making such calls for customer conversion.
“If a bank engages either directly or indirectly, through an intermediary to make calls to a database of consumers to sell/inform about its various services….the initiator of the call (i.e the intermediary) along with the bank will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines,” the guidelines state.
The proposed guidelines define what comprises a pesky or fraudulent call and list the types of communication to be deemed unsolicited or unwarranted.
The focus of the guidelines is on fixing accountability and ensuring all promotional and transactional communications happen only through the authorised channel

The norms also propose to prohibit communication in violation of the regulator-prescribed number series.
According to estimates, India ranks among the largest markets for SMS phishing, amid a growing mobile user base and low phone tariffs.
Some industry estimates say one of every 12 people is vulnerable every month to phishing. More than 120-150 million
phishing messages
are sent every month, with 60-75 million unique citizens vulnerable to attacks. Roughly 300,000 people get scammed, but only 35,000-45,000 report these incidents.
The Department of
Consumer Affairs
officials has put the guidelines in public domain after discussions with the officials of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), as well as executives from Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
, Vodafone Idea, Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) and industry association COAI.
The Department of Consumer Affairs in February constituted a committee to draft guidelines on the issue of unwarranted and unsolicited commercial communication. The panel discussed the first draft last month.
Operators and telemarketers are already governed as per the current
regulations
concerning pesky communications by DoT and Trai. In addition to that, the new guidelines will look into the aspects such as the legal arrangement between telemarketers and operators with principal entities like banks.
Seeking to put a stop to promotional messages from normal 10-digit mobile numbers, the regulator in 2021 came out with a blockchain-based distributed ledger technologies (DLT) platform for enterprises and telemarketers. It told telcos to enable transmission of promotional messages only through this channel after proper KYC process. Enterprises and telemarketers need to obtain a header and register message templates, and they can send messages only in conformance with these.
Preceding that was the
do not disturb
(DND) system started by Trai, where a user had to request to be included in such a registry.
However, despite all these initiatives, people get numerous and daily spam or promotional messages from unregistered telemarketers. Such messages mainly come from the financial services and real estate sector.

Consumer Affairs Ministry
on Thursday sought
public comments
until July 21 on
draft guidelines
to curb unsolicited and
unwanted business communications
like promotional calls and text messages. The guidelines -- prepared after consultations with stakeholders, including telecom firms and
regulators
-- define ""business communication"" as any communication related to goods or services like promotional and service messages but excludes personal communication.
They will apply to all individuals and entities that make or engage others for such communications or benefit from them, the ministry said in a statement.
The draft guidelines classify any business communication as unsolicited and unwanted if it does not comply with the recipient's consent or registered preferences.
Other conditions that would make a communication unauthorised include using unregistered numbers or SMS headers, calling despite recipients opting out, failing to obtain digital consent, not identifying the caller and purpose, and lacking an opt-out option.
The proposals also bar such communications that violate the telecom regulator Telecom Regulations Authority of India (Trai) rules on commercial messages based on customer preferences.

As per a report in the Times of India, telcos have begun ""limited trials"" in Mumbai and Haryana. Quoting sources, the paper claimed that the operators are planning to add more cities over the coming weeks.
The CNAP (Calling Name Presentation) is being seen as a way to curb spam and fraud calls, which have seen a marked increase in recent times.
""Trials are beginning on limited numbers as we try and assess the feasibility of CNAP, where not only the number but even the name of the caller will be displayed during incoming calls. We will be sharing the results of the trials with
DoT

TRAI had earlier said that the government should issue appropriate instructions for making CNAP available on all mobile phones sold in India after a suitable cut-off date from the date of notification.

The telecom operators, however, had opposed the move, citing technical challenges.
Mukesh Ambani's
Reliance Jio
has said that this should ""not be a mandatory service,"" adding that ""there will be many technical issues like increased load on signalling and possible impact on latency and interconnection-related issues.""
Airtel
said there are ""likely to be techno-commercial challenges"" involved in implementing the measure and added that CNAP would need to adhere to privacy laws. ""Privacy is an important consideration, and the framework is going to have to address the genuine concerns of users who may not be keen to share their details.""
Voda Idea said CNAP should be introduced ""as an optional service"" and should not be mandated upon telcos.

Trai won’t charge users for multiple SIMs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-wont-charge-users-for-multiple-sims/articleshow/110996526.cms,14-06-2024,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
Trai
) has refuted recent media reports, claiming that the regulator planned to charge consumers holding multiple
SIMs
, or mobile connections.
“….some media houses have reported Trai has proposed introducing fees for mobile and landline numbers with an aim to ensure efficient allocation of finite resources. The speculation that Trai intends to impose charges on customers for holding multiple SIMs/numbering resources is unequivocally false,” the sector regulator said, in a clarification Friday on its recent discussion paper on formulating a revised national numbering plan for
telecom services
after factoring in resource constraints.
The telecom regulator added that the media speculation is “unfounded and serves only to mislead the public”.
In its discussion paper, issued June 6, Trai had invited industry views on whether financial disincentives must be slapped on telcos if allocated telecommunications identifier (TI) resources remained unused beyond a certain timeframe.

Trai move to charge for numbers will increase cost for users, telcos say
The TIs are a series of digits, characters and symbols, or a combination of these, used to identify a unique user of landline and mobile services. Trai believes with the advent of
5G networks
, TIs will play a pivotal role in ensuring efficient communications and network management.
In its paper, Trai had invited suggestions on the need for a charging mechanism and possible charges for existing/newly allocated TI resources to ensure efficient usage.
It had noted that telcos often capitalise on market demand by offering vanity or “highly coveted” numbers at premium rates and resort to conducting auctions to maximise revenues from such number allocations.
Also that a significant number of service providers levy charges on subscribers for acquiring these preferred numbers.

It had further said that such practices not only lead to inefficient utilisation of numbering resources but also result in hoarding of numbering resources. “Hence, it may be prudent to consider charging TSPs with a nominal fee against numbering resource allocated.” Trai has said in the paper.
Telcos, though, in response to the regulator’s proposals have cautioned that any move to start collecting fees on sale of numbers would result in the additional costs being passed on to consumers.
However, Trai Friday said it has consistently advocated minimum regulatory intervention and promoted forbearance and self-regulation of market forces. “We unequivocally repudiate and emphatically condemn any spurious conjectures that perpetuate the circulation of misleading information concerning the consultation paper at hand.”
At present, DoT is the custodian of TI resources in India and oversees its allocation for both landline and mobile networks in sync with the International Telecommunication Union's global standards.

DoT dials cops to stop network gear theft,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-dials-cops-to-stop-network-gear-theft/articleshow/110562187.cms,30-05-2024,"The Department of Telecommunications (
DoT
) has called on its enforcement units to alert all state police departments across India to clamp down on the rampant theft of critical network gear that has already triggered around Rs 800 crore of losses for
telcos
, disrupted 4G/5G expansions and impacted quality of
mobile coverage
.
In a directive, dated May 27, the department has asked its field enforcement units in all licence service areas (LSAs) to also conduct quarterly reviews of the telecom gear theft situation with national law enforcement agencies. It also wants the matter to be taken up at upcoming state broadband committee meetings.
The DoT directive comes after
Reliance Jio
,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea (Vi) recently sought the government’s intervention, saying they were facing huge losses and heavy additional replenishment costs amid rising incidence of
network gear theft
across India. They had pointed out that expensive active
telecoms infrastructure gear
such as remote radio units (RRUs) and base-band units (BBUs) were being regularly stolen since October 2023.
“The LSAs are requested to conduct regular meetings with
telecom service providers
(TSPs) on the
equipment theft
and sensitise state police regarding the issue,” the DoT said in an internal letter to its field enforcement units, a copy of which was seen by ET.
In its letter, DoT added that telcos had pointed out that such
telecom equipment theft
incidents were higher in some geographies, including Delhi-NCR, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
Live Events
“The TSPs are estimated to have already incurred around Rs 800 crore of losses as well as additional expenses towards replenishing the stolen equipment. But customers are the ones suffering the most as such incidents invariably lead to a decline in the quality of mobile broadband services,” said a senior executive of one of India’s biggest telcos.
He added that network expansions were also impacted, and that due to technical and legal challenges, telcos were unable to recover the stolen gear in most cases, which is why, strict government action is needed.
Back in March 2024, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents Jio, Airtel and Vi, had alerted telecoms secretary Neeraj Mittal that multiple foreign websites were allegedly selling a host of active
telecoms infrastructure
gear online suspected to have been stolen from India’s telco networks.
The COAI, in fact, had then named some of these foreign websites in its letter to Mittal and had called on the government to block them immediately. Some international websites named in COAI’s letter, dated March 14, included eBay, Alibaba, Telefly, Seeker816 and Dorfatrade that were allegedly involved in selling stolen telecom network gear. ET has seen a copy of COAI’s letter.
The telco lobby body had also called for strict action from the authorities, pointing out that theft of active network gear would be covered within the offence of causing damage to telecom infrastructure under the Telecommunications Act, 2023. “The government has already recognised the seriousness of such an offence and classified the same as a cognizable and non-bailable offence under the Act.”

Govt bodies and banks to use 160 and 161 numbering series for service calls: DoT,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/govt-bodies-and-banks-to-use-160-and-161-numbering-series-for-service-calls-dot/articleshow/110504926.cms,28-05-2024,"In an attempt to reduce
pesky calls
, the
telecom department
has allocated
160 and 161 numbering series
for transactional and
service calls
made by businesses for
commercial purposes
.
All central and state government entities shall use 10-digit
phone numbers
telephone numbers in the format of 1600ABCXXX whereas
financial entities
regulated by
RBI
,
SEBI
,
IRDAI
and
PFRDA
shall use 1601ABCXXX, the department of telecommunications (
DoT
) said in a notification late Tuesday.
Previously, only 140 number series were allocated for all kinds of commercial purposes. Post Tuesday’s mandate these will be classified into (140) marketing and (160 and 161) for service calls to easily identify the purpose of the caller.
ET
had written about the upcoming mandate back in March.
The move is complementary to
TRAI
’s (telecom regulatory authority of India) recent recommendations for network operators as well as mobile device makers to enable display of caller’s name, both for personal phone numbers as well as enterprise callers.

The demarcation will largely benefit financial institutions such as bank to alert customers on use cases such as credit card payment reminders. Previously, subscribers had stopped receiving
transactional calls
assuming that a number originating from 140 would be spam.
But the new 160 and 161 series shall also ensure that subscribers do not fall prey to fraudsters dialling from personal SIMs to dupe recipients into believing that they were genuine bank representatives.
As per DoT’s notification, the 1600ABCXXX format shall be followed to allocate phone numbers, where XXX is any range between 000-999, AB shall represent the telecom circle such as Kolkata while C shall represent service provider such as Bharti Airtel.
Any other entity, besides government and financial institutions, who wishes to seek allocation under the said category will need to seek approval from the telecom regulator, the notification said.

GST to be paid by telcos along with instalments towards spectrum charges,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/gst-to-be-paid-by-telcos-along-with-instalments-towards-spectrum-charges/articleshow/110467031.cms,27-05-2024,"New Delhi:
Telecom companies
will have to pay
GST
along with the
instalments
paid towards
spectrum charges
, a senior official said. The Department of
Telecom
(
DoT
) will hold the next round of
spectrum auction
on June 6 for eight
spectrum bands
meant for
mobile phone services
. The base price for the auction has been set at Rs 96,317 crore.
The spectrum will be assigned for 20 years and successful bidders will be allowed to make payments in 20 equal annual instalments in the coming mega auction.
The official said Goods and Services Tax (GST) will have to be paid at 18 per cent by telecom companies along with each instalment.
""The
GST Council
in its next meeting is likely to clarify the procedure for payment of GST by companies winning the bids during the spectrum auction,"" the official told PTI.
The clarification will end confusion among field formations regarding the method for collection of GST in the auction process.

said under the GST law, spectrum payment is covered under licensing services for the right to use other natural resources on which tax is levied at 18 per cent.
""Spectrum charges are payable in a phased manner over a period of time, and thereby tax payment shall also be staggered. The board should issue a clarification in this respect so as to avoid any litigation in this regard,"" Mohan said.

Your phone bill could rise by up to 25% post election,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/your-phone-bill-could-rise-by-up-to-25-post-election/articleshow/110093910.cms,14-05-2024,"MUMBAI: Mobile phone users could see about
25% increase
in their bills after the general election as
telecom companies
prepare for the fourth round of
tariff hikes
in recent years, a move which would give a boost to their
average revenue per user
(
ARPU
).
“We expect a meaningful hike of around 25% by the operators in the near term on the back of a stable competitive environment, their need to improve profitability following heavy
5G investment
, and continued government support,” said a report by brokerage
Axis Capital
.
The report said while the quantum of hike may appear large, it should be manageable for both urban and rural users, especially as
data usage
is sticky. For
urban households
, subscribers spending on telecom would go up from 3.2% of total expenditure to 3.6%, it said, while for rural subscribers spending would increase from 5.2% to 5.9%.
The roughly 25% increase in headline rates would result in a 16% growth in ARPU for telecom operators, Rs 29 for
Bharti Airtel
and Rs 26 for
Jio
, Axis Capital estimated.
Jio reported an ARPU of Rs 181.7 for the quarter to March, while the numbers for
Bharti Airtel
and
Vodafone Idea
(Vi) were Rs 208 and Rs 145 respectively for the October-December 2023 period. Bharti Airtel and Vi have yet to report the March quarter numbers.
Live Events
Operators will look towards monetising capex investments in 5G by undertaking tariff correction of bundled packs, said
Peeyush Vaish
, TMT industry leader,
Deloitte
, South Asia. “We expect a 10-15% increase in ARPUs to add around Rs 100 per subscriber by end of this calendar year, helped by price increase for 4G/5G bundled packs and phasing out of some low-value packs,” he said. “Users had to upgrade to bundled plans when telcos cut down Rs 40-50 singular offerings for voice/data. This pushed up ARPUs from Rs 120 and Rs 200 on average. We expect telcos to add another Rs 100 per user as they may continue to kill base plans.”
Vaish added that consumers are likely to remain sticky. “As long as they experience high speed connectivity, consumers are willing to pay for telecom services,” he said.
Analysts expect Bharti Airtel and Jio to be the largest beneficiaries of the wireless pack price increase.
According to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities, the two telcos increased their ARPU by 58% and 33% respectively, between September 2019 and September 2023, following the past three tariff hikes which saw rates increase 14-102%.
Vi saw a 33% increase in ARPU during this period, while its overall wireless revenue declined by 7%.
“Vi’s consistent subscriber losses have offset the benefits of tariff hikes and upgradation of subscribers from low-value packs. Despite the sharp tariff hikes it has undertaken in all three rounds, Vi’s wireless revenue remains below pre-hike levels (September 2019),” a Mumbai-based brokerage analyst said on condition of anonymity.
The analyst said while he expects Vi to increase its ARPU as it arrests some subscriber churn by strengthening its network, the net impact on revenue may still be limited compared to its rivals.
Vi’s chief executive Akshaya Moondra had previously said that the company will focus on upgrading its 2G subscribers (nearly 42% of its total base) which is causing an overhang on ARPU growth.
“We aim to upgrade this population to 4G since the conversion from low-value packs towards unlimited data plans causes an ARPU improvement of nearly three times,” Moondra said.

) to seek approval and clarity on
satellite communications
, particularly on
data transfer

equipment

used in satellite gateways based in India, said officials privy to the details.
The department is yet to finalise terms and conditions that would be included in awarding satellite communication with the aim of safeguarding security and integrity of the country, the officials told ET.
“The views of NSCS around security parameters are important as satellite communications can’t be barred by physical borders,” said one of the persons cited above. The NSCS is the working body of the National Security Council (NSC), which is chaired by the Prime Minister.
Another person said once NSCS gives its views, the government will frame terms and conditions around security and, if required, inputs from
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) will also be sought.
The person said the government must enact robust measures to prevent misuse of satellite communications, especially by hostile actors.

To safeguard telecom networks, the government had mandated operators to procure equipment only from “trusted sources” effective June 15, 2021. Following the mandate, Chinese firms like
Huawei
and
ZTE
were not allowed to participate in rolling out networks, including 5G in the country.
Since satellite communications are set to become more prevalent in future, the security of networks must be set right, said experts.
DoT is yet to decide on when it intends to allocate satellite spectrum administratively to companies. Apart from finalising modalities around pricing and frequencies to be used for such satellite communications, the department needs clarity on the security parameters.
Telecom Act 2023 notified by the government clearly defines the kind of spectrum that can be given administratively.
However, the Supreme Court registrar had in April declined to accept the government’s plea for allowing administrative allocation of spectrum in some special cases such as for satellite communications. The registrar said the government was seeking a review of the 2012 order in the 2G case “in the guise” of seeking clarifications and said the move was “misconceived”.
However, officials told ET that through the application, the government merely wanted to highlight possible future exceptional circumstances for allocating bandwidth administratively and did not have any intention of seeking a change in the top court’s order of 2012.
The government is moving carefully on the satellite communications issue, wary that the technology is fast evolving and in future, satcom services can also be offered directly to mobile consumers on their handsets.
The satellite communications market in India is at a nascent stage but the potential is substantial, particularly in rural and remote areas. As per an EY-ISpA report, India’s space economy is set to expand to $13 billion by 2025, recording a compound annual growth rate of 6% from nearly $9.6 billion in 2020.

Trai pushes for spectrum sharing among telcos in bid to promote optimum resource utilisation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-pushes-for-spectrum-sharing-among-telcos-in-bid-to-promote-optimum-resource-utilisation/articleshow/109569459.cms,25-04-2024,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
Trai
) has recommended the use of active and
passive infrastructure
sharing among telecom service licensees to promote optimum resource utilisation.
The regulator Wednesday also recommended inter-band
spectrum sharing
between service providers in a licensed service area (LSA), along with suggesting exploring the possibility of allowing service providers to access globally harmonised spectrum bands assigned to government agencies or other non-telecom entities through authorised shared access (ASA) technique-based spectrum-sharing.
The authority also recommended conditions for spectrum sharing, trading and leasing, which has been permitted under the new Telecommunications Act, 2023.
Presently, sharing of
active infrastructure
is limited to antenna, feeder cable, Node B, Radio Access Network (RAN) and transmission system only.
The telecom regulator has now allowed sharing of all active infrastructure elements, including core network elements owned, established and operated by
telecom service providers
(TSPs) with all types of telecom service licensees, as per the scope of their services.
Live Events
However, Trai said sharing of core network elements cannot be done if the number of independent core networks for a particular telecom service is reduced to less than two by such sharing.
As for passive infrastructure, operators can already share elements such as building, tower, electrical equipment including battery and power plant, dark fibre, duct space and right of way.
The recommendations will now need to be approved by the Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the highest decision-making body of the Department of Telecommunications.
Trai said in current and future projects of the ministry’s universal service obligation fund (USOF), universal service providers cannot refuse to share passive infrastructure laid under the project with at least two other carriers.
Although the sharing of active infrastructure laid under projects of USOF should be voluntary and based on mutual agreements, Trai empasised.
Trai has also recommended that inter-band access spectrum sharing between telcos in a service area should be permitted and may be implemented either by way of pooling of spectrum in different frequency bands through common radio networks, or by allowing the partner provider to use the radio access networks of each other operating in a shared frequency band. It has also allowed leasing - not more than 50% of spectrum holding - of spectrum acquired either through auction or trading.
Telcos sharing spectrum are liable to pay a non-refundable sharing fee of 0.5% of the applicable market price of the frequency shared prorated for the period of sharing. This can be paid either through an upfront payment, or annual instalments.
Trai has recommended inter-band spectrum sharing in the sub-1 GHz bands, 1800 MHz and 2100 Hz bands, 2300 Hz, 2500 Hz, and 3300-3670 MHz bands, and 26 GHz and in newly identified bands.
However, the regulator said operators are not allowed to enter inter-band access spectrum sharing with more than one operator in a spectrum band category in each circle, and under the condition that post-sharing, there will be at least two independent wireless networks in the LSA.
Sharing of any frequency should be permitted only after a lock-in period of two years from the date of acquisition through auction or trading, Trai said, adding that the amount received by operators under the sharing agreement should form part of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for levying licence fee and spectrum usage charges.

Govt favours level playing field in telecom amid satcom entry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/govt-favours-level-playing-field-in-telecom-amid-satcom-entry/articleshow/109563232.cms,24-04-2024,"NEW DELHI: The government does not intend to disturb the “level-playing field” in the
telecom sector
, particularly due to
satcom
services for which spectrum will be given administratively to players but at a pricing that is fair to all.
The government will soon write to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) to suggest pricing and other modalities around satellite spectrum, a senior official said Wednesday.
Reiterating that the government has not sought to change the 2012 Supreme Court judgement—which backed auction as the preferred mode of spectrum allocation—the official said the government’s intention to file a plea in the apex court was to let them know about specific cases where the airwaves have to be allocated administratively.
“We had filed a miscellaneous application in the Supreme Court on December 15 explaining what we intend to do, before the Telecom Bill was tabled in the Parliament on December 18,” the official said.
However, there was no prayer to change the verdict or seek any judgement.

“We have said in the application that auction is the best way to allocate spectrum but in certain cases, clearly defined and mentioned in the bill itself, administrative allocation may be required. It was more like informing the court,” the official added.
The official stressed that Parliament has framed the law, and it was not necessary to approach the top court but just to be transparent, the apex court has been informed.
“Once the Parliament has decided something, the matter is closed unless someone challenges the law, when the matter is opened again,” the official added.
To a query around satellite spectrum, the official said the main concern among the stakeholders was that it would disturb the level-playing field. “We have categorically said that Trai will do a very clear, open consultation process and come up with a pricing or mechanism, which will be transparent and fair to all.”
Allocation of satellite spectrum will be done after Trai gives pricing and other modalities for the spectrum.
The reason there has been a delay in sending the reference to Trai by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is a technical issue.
As per the Trai Act, if there was an old reference on a particular matter, either that has to be cancelled or disagreed by the government before the new process can commence. DoT had earlier asked Trai to submit recommendations on satellite spectrum, but with the passing of the Telecom Act, the issue became infructuous. Now Trai has returned the earlier reference, allowing the new process to commence.
“They have returned, which means the old consultation is over. Now the new consultation has to start. We are working on finalising our reference to Trai that should go out in a few weeks,” the official said.
The government may also take inputs from the industry as to what should be written in the reference.
Though the terms of reference have not been finalised, the government basically wants to know what frequencies should be used, pricing and from a security point of view, what terms and conditions should be there.

The Trai is therefore seeking comments on what quantum of these airwaves should be put to auction, for what validity period and in which service areas.
It has also sought comments on
spectrum pricing
, block size, minimum bid quantity and other metrics related to the auctioning.
Trai has also asked for views on whether there could be any challenges in sharing of 37.5-40 GHz and 42.5-43.5 GHz spectrum frequency ranges between IMT and Satellite Gateway links.

Bharti Airtel rejects Jio view on commercial usage of allocated satcom spectrum,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/bharti-airtel-rejects-jio-view-on-commercial-usage-of-allocated-satcom-spectrum/articleshow/109014230.cms,04-04-2024,"Reliance Jio, India’s telecom market leader, and the
Bharti Group
are on course for a fierce battle over using
spectrum allocated
administratively, or without auctions, for
satellite-based
fixed wireless access (FWA) services.
Bharti-backed
Eutelsat OneWeb
has rejected billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio’s contention that administratively allocated satellite
spectrum
can’t be used for offering commercial
FWA services
merely since it is a 5G use case.
Eutelsat also feels 5G-based FWA and satellite-based FWA are distinct services with different business models and there is no justification in Jio pushing the government to ensure only satellite-based FWA services are offered through auctioned spectrum.
“Jio is unnecessarily trying to confuse matters by comparing apples with oranges. It’s a clear fact that 5G-based FWA services will be directly offered by telcos to millions of retail users across India whereas satellite-based services will only be offered in the country’s remote, unconnected regions, primarily to enterprises, defence forces, government health centres and for disaster management operations via a B2B model,” a senior Eutelsat OneWeb executive said.
Eutelsat OneWeb, in fact, asserts that it is not in competition with Jio as it will not be directly offering satellite-based FWA services to retail users.

To be sure,
Bharti
Group-backed telecom operator
Bharti Airtel
, along with Jio, have started offering 5G FWA services to retail users in the country, mainly in areas where laying fibre is a challenge.
Top executives of Eutelsat OneWeb countered Jio after the latter recently urged the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) not to allow use of satellite spectrum allocated administratively for commercial services like FWA on grounds of it being a 5G use case, arguing that such satellite-based FWA services must only be offered through auctioned airwaves.
Further, Jio said in case the government decides to allow FWA for satellite players, then the amounts paid by telcos for buying such spectrum in past auctions must be refunded to ensure a level-playing field.
“Given that 5G-based FWA is a B2C broadband service offered to retail customers and that the satellite-based service will predominantly be meant for a much smaller customer base, mostly in the B2B domain in remote areas that are unconnected, the logic of refund as called out in the submission by Jio doesn't hold good,” said the Eutelsat OneWeb executive cited earlier.
The stakes are huge for both companies.
Eutelsat OneWeb, which recently received demo or `trial’ satellite spectrum via the administrative route from DoT, is looking to pull ahead of Elon Musk's Starlink and Jio in an increasingly competitive space to become the first global satellite operator to offer broadband-from-space services in India.
Eutelsat’s aim is to roll out satellite broadband in India’s rural and remote regions underserved by terrestrial networks. The company has been allocated demo satellite airwaves in both the `Ka’ and `Ku’ bands for 90 days via the administrative route at a nominal application fee.
But Jio, which like Eutelsat OneWeb, also has a GMPCS (global mobile personal communications by satellite services) permit, is in no mood to give the
satcom
company an easy ride in India’s still nascent broadband-from-space market with high growth potential. This, even as the government readies to finalise modalities around administrative allocation of commercial satellite spectrum and determine its pricing based on the sector regulator’s recommendations.
ET’s queries to Jio remained unanswered till press time.
India’s Telecommunications Act, 2023, has already given legislative backing to allocation of satellite spectrum via the administrative or the ‘non-auctions route’.
Telcos globally including Airtel and Jio are counting on 5G-based FWA services to break the 5G monetisation logjam and open new revenue streams. Management consulting firm Analysys Mason estimates monthly average revenue per user (ARPUs) from 5G FWA business to be at least three times more (about Rs 600) than 5G mobile ARPUs.
Eutelsat OneWeb executives say the company is already offering commercial satellite-based FWA services via its B2B model in remote, unconnected regions of North America (including Canada), Europe and South Africa as is the global practice. According to the company, satcoms can act as a complementary service to terrestrial communications in bridging digital inclusion gap and in servicing specific use cases of non-retail customers.
India’s space regulator IN-SPACe estimates the country’s space economy to have the potential to touch $44 billion by 2033, and account for about 8% of the global share from about 2% currently.

DoT asks Telcos to deactivate USSD-based call forwarding service from April,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-asks-telcos-to-deactivate-ussd-based-call-forwarding-service-from-april/articleshow/108905753.cms,30-03-2024,"The Department of Telecommunications (

telecom operators
to deactivate
USSD

""It has been decided by the competent authority that all
licensees
shall discontinue the existing
USSD-based call forwarding
services with effect from 15.04.2024 till further notice,"" DoT said in a recent notice.
This follows growing reports of fraudsters convincing mobile phone users to activate call forwarding to other phone numbers through the USSD service, so as to be able to steal confidential information, such as one-time password (OTP).
""All existing subscribers who have activated USSD-based call forwarding service may be asked to reactivate call forwarding services through alternative methods to ensure that such services are not activated without their notice,"" it said.
Mobile users avail of the USSD service by dialling codes on their keypads. It is often used for checking prepaid balance or the IMEI (international mobile equipment identity) number.

Telecom regulator releases recommendations for embedded SIMs in IoT devices,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telecom-regulator-releases-recommendations-for-embedded-sims-in-iot-devices/articleshow/108685186.cms,21-03-2024,"The
telecom regulator
has released recommendations for
embedded SIMs
in
IoT devices
, mandating conversion to
local service providers
within six months, among others, in a bid to increase the scope of
5G applications
in various sectors.
The recommendations by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
TRAI
) released Thursday are meant to address issues in regulating the
IoT
landscape that includes the likes of smart meters, agricultural sensors and more, that is growing in the face of increasing digitisation of the economy.
“Implementation of these Recommendations by the Government will promote orderly growth in the M2M eSIM segment of the telecom sector in India and will stimulate the development of a homegrown M2M eSIM ecosystem in the country, thus enabling the growth of modern M2M communication,” TRAI said.
The recommendations will now be examined by the telecom department who will decide on implementing them. TRAI’s suggestions are aimed at streamlining the regulatory landscape of machine-to-machine (M2M) embedded SIM (eSIM) in India, wherein the regulatory body has recommended on
security through proper KYC
, and a framework for profile switching for eSIMs and swapping of SM-SR (Subscription Manager Secure Routing).
TRAI also recommended the Telecom Engineering Center (TEC) to examine possiblity of devising a standard process for device-to-device transfer of profiles on consumer eSIMs.
Live Events
TRAI has recommended mandatory conversion of all eSIMs in an imported device running on international roaming to communication profiles of Indian telecom service providers (TSPs) within six months from the date of activation or on change of ownership of the device.
TRAI said SM-SR sites, which delivers encrypted operator credentials to SIMs can only be managed by unified access service license holders and its derivatives, adding that equipment makers and M2M service providers will have the flexibility of choosing where to install the local profile, whether through the existing (foreign) SM-SR or in India.
The body also said that such migration of communication profiles should be completed within three months from the date of receipt of formal request from the OEM.

Govt introduces spectrum regulatory sandbox for testing telecom equipment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/govt-introduces-spectrum-regulatory-sandbox-for-testing-telecom-equipment/articleshow/108402373.cms,11-03-2024,"New Delhi: The government has notified guidelines on a
spectrum regulatory sandbox
allowing entities including educational institutions, telcos and network manufacturers to test their equipment by paying a notional amount and doing registration.
As per Communications Minister
Ashwini Vaishnaw
, through the sandbox, the Department of Telecommunications (
DoT
) will be giving easy permissions to test new equipment that requires use of spectrum.
“Let’s say, a college design a new equipment which requires spectrum to be used for testing. Instead of coming to DoT for a license and a number of license conditions and a series of other requirements, can we create a very simple construct in which the college simply logs in through a portal and everything that needs to be done is done by paying a token amount of Rs 1000,” Vaishnaw said.
He added that was the thought process of designing the regulatory sandbox.
The sandbox or wireless test zones will enable hassle-free and flexible environment for R&D and technology trials. It will also help development of use cases in the present and next generation telecom technologies.

The test zones have been characterised in two categories. Under first category, experiment can be done in all the vacant frequency bands and can be established on campuses situated in urban or populated areas while in the other category, test zones can be established only in uninhabited remote areas.
The entities that can test the equipment include academia, R&D labs, telecom service providers, equipment manufacturers, central and state government departments etc.
Speaking on the occasion, the Minister also announced the launch of
India Mobile Congress
(IMC) 2024 from October 15. Along with the IMC, India will be hosting World Telecommunication Standardisation Assembly (WTSA 2024) from October 15-24.
This is going to be the eighth edition of India’s flagship telecom event.
This year’s event will put a major focus on Artificial Intelligence, Quantum technology and Circular Economy along with spotlight on 6G, 5G use-case showcase, cloud & edge computing, IoT, semiconductors, cybersecurity, green tech, satcom and electronics manufacturing.
The IMC 2024 and ITU Conferences are expected to witness around 8,000 plus CXOs and industry delegates, 150,000 plus attendees, 350+ exhibitors, 400+ speakers, 80+ sessions.

"Separate number series for marketing, service calls soon to curb spam",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/separate-number-series-for-marketing-service-calls-soon-to-curb-spam/articleshow/108308116.cms,07-03-2024,"In an attempt to reduce pesky calls, the
telecom regulator
shall soon issue a mandate to demarcate separate numbering series for transactional versus
marketing calls
made by businesses for
commercial purposes
.
Currently, only 140 number series are allocated for all kinds of commercial purposes. These could in future be classified into (140) marketing and (160 or 161) for
service calls
to easily identify the purpose of the caller. The move is complementary to
Trai
's (
telecom regulatory authority of India
) recent recommendations for network operators as well as mobile device makers to enable display of caller's name, both for personal phone numbers as well as enterprise callers.
""The DoT has approved our recommendation to allocate separate series which have been tested for both purposes...Trai shall soon issue a direction in this regard,"" a senior Trai official told ET.
He added that voice calls have lately become a larger spam channel as compared to SMSes after the implementation of the blockchain-based filtering system by telcos. ""While SMS complaints have come down to just 30,000 per month, reports against unwanted calls through 10-digit personal numbers have gone upto a few lakhs.""
This is largely because, even though the 140-numbering series is reserved for commercial purposes, subscribers have stopped receiving them assuming that a number originating from 140 would be spam. Enterprises, therefore, started using personal numbers.

""Even banks were unable to fulfil transaction verification calls because subscribers would simply ignore 140 numbers. They had to ultimately resort to other private unregistered SIMs,"" the Trai official said.
It became a menace because fraudsters using personal SIMs could now dupe recipients into believing that they were genuine bank representatives. ""That's why a clear demarcation for service calls was required.""
The regulator shall announce a distinct range (likely 160 or 161), so that recipients can easily identify a transactional call without confusion with a marketing call, which shall continue to originate from 140 series as registered currently.
As per TRAI data, there are 305,587 entities registered for sending commercial SMSes and calls. However, the universe is much larger as several entities use 10-digit P2P numbers to make telemarketing calls.
""Given that getting private connections is so easy, with up to 10 SIM cards permissible per national ID, businesses refrain from taking the official route for making marketing calls,"" an executive at a communications startup said.
He added that price wars and the race among telcos to gain subscribers has led to ruthless disregard for the KYC (know-your-customer) procedure mandated for selling SIM cards.
The government is taking several steps in the spam war. Besides the calling name display feature, the DoT last month launched two portals - 'Chakshu' and the DIP (Digital Intelligence Platform).

The advisory says that when you offer an AI product, you have to be careful not to give half-developed products which are subject to hallucination or putting out things which are inaccurate,"" S Krishnan, Secretary, MeitY, told ET.
The official said that the social media companies must remove such ""deepfakes"" posts from their platforms as soon as it comes to one's notice.
Further, Krishnan said deep fakes are a misrepresentation, and any such abuse, according to him, is already covered under the IT Act and Rules.
Rule 2(1)(w) of the IT Rules 2021 define a “social media intermediary” as an intermediary, primarily or solely enables online interaction between two or more users and allows them to create, upload, share, disseminate, modify or access information using its services.

Deepfakes are a manipulation of a person's facial appearance through deep generative methods, backed by AI including imaging and voice rendering techniques.
""A deepfake is nothing but a misrepresentation applying new and better technology. The important thing is to act quickly and see that this misrepresentation is immediately straightened out so that it doesn't spread too fast.""
Following the absence of a regulatory regime worldwide, deepfake or misinformation has become one of nightmares, calling for a responsible use of AI.
In December last year, the ministry issued a similar advisory to social media giants such as Mark Zuckerberg-headed Meta, Elon Musk-owned X and Alphabet's Google asking them to take down deepfakes.
It also instructed intermediaries to ensure compliance with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.
Recently, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
called deepfakes ""one of the biggest threats"" that the Indian system was facing, and added that the menace could cause chaos in society.
Following the upcoming Lok Sabha elections this year, the matter gained much notoriety with concerns centred around social networking platforms channelising higher volumes of deepfakes by malicious actors, misrepresenting public figures or lawmakers to gain political mileage.
Early this month, a deepfake of Indian billionaire and
Reliance Industries
chairman Mukesh Ambani was circulated, using AI voice cloning technology to promote a stock market community.
While regulators and law enforcement agencies are struggling to cope with the rise of AI-generated disinformation, social activists worry that such may pose a threat to civil society.

"Govt likely to treat satellite broadband as  telecom service, allow 100% FDI via automatic route",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/government-may-treat-satellite-broadband-as-telecom-service/articleshow/108245666.cms,06-03-2024,"The government is likely to treat satellite broadband as a telecom service, and accordingly, the likes of Bharti-backed
Eutelsat OneWeb
, Elon Musk’s Starlink, Jeff Bezos-led
Amazon Kuiper
and Canada’s Telesat are set to be eligible for 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) through the automatic route, akin to telecom service providers, top lawyers and senior satellite industry executives said.
Such a move is likely to offer much needed clarity to global investors on the applicable foreign ownership rules, especially to companies planning to launch broadband-from-space services in India, and pave the way for top dollar inflows into India’s satcoms sector, these people added.
But companies involved in manufacturing or operation of satellites or in the generation/dissemination of earth observation/remote sensing satellite data and data products will only qualify for 74% FDI through the automatic route as per the amended FDI rules for the space sector issued by the commerce ministry Tuesday. These companies would need to take the government route to boost foreign ownership to 100%.
“Global satellite-based broadband providers, to the extent that they are only providing broadband services, and not falling within any other activities listed in the (space sector FDI) amendments, should fall under the 100% automatic investment route for telecom,”
Anirudh Rastogi
, managing partner at Ikigai Law, told ET.
Ikigai is a tech-focused law firm that advises some of the world’s biggest satellite service players.

Rastogi added that the latest amendments to the space sector FDI rules apply to manufacture and operation of satellite systems, supply of ground/user segments and earth-observation data products. “Telecom services, even if provided by satellites, are not covered, and should come within the ambit of telecom FDI rules.”
Satellite industry experts, in fact, expect the Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT), the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and the Department of Space (DoS) to shortly clear the air on satellite broadband services coming within the ambit of telecom FDI rules.
“Since there is no direct mention in the amended space sector FDI rules, this seems to imply that `satellite broadband service’, which is in the nature of a high-speed internet service, would most likely come under the ambit of telecom FDI regulations where 100% foreign ownership through the automatic route is permitted. We are waiting for DoT and DoS to clarify this, but if this is indeed the case, it will help India attract big-bang investments from global satellite broadband players, including Eutelsat OneWeb, Starlink, Amazon Kuiper and Canada’s Telesat, amongst others,” said A K Bhatt, director general, Indian Space Association (ISpA), a grouping of space and satellite companies.
Both Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Reliance Jio’s
satcom
venture are striving for a first mover’s advantage over the likes of Starlink, Amazon and the Tatas in the still nascent satcoms market in India that has high growth potential.
Space sector regulator, IN-SPACe, recently estimated India’s space economy has the potential to hit $44 billion by 2033 and account for about 8% of the global share by then, up from around 2% now.
Broadband-from-space services in India will be primarily targeted at populations currently underserved by traditional terrestrial broadband solutions, including in rural and remote areas with limited or zero access to high-speed internet.
Last month, the Cabinet had amended the space sector FDI rules. It had also allowed up to 49% FDI under the automatic route for satellite launch vehicles and up to 100% FDI under automatic route for manufacturing of satellite sector components and sub-systems.

Such preferred name, it said, could be the `trademark name’ registered with the corporate affairs ministry or the `trade name’ registered with the GST Council, or any other such unique name duly registered with the government.
Trai has also called on DoT to formulate guidelines for documents to be provided by subscriber entities holding bulk connections and business connections for registering their ‘preferred name’ with telcos.
The regulator has also suggested that DoT stipulate necessary rules for preventing any misuse of this facility.

Spectrum worth ₹5.45 lakh cr may be freed for 5G-6G,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/spectrum-worth-5-45-lakh-cr-may-be-freed-for-5g-6g/articleshow/107570292.cms,10-02-2024,"New Delhi: The
Department of Telecommunications
(
DoT
) is looking to unlock about ₹5.45 lakh crore worth of
spectrum
for
5G
and
6G
needs through refarming or repurposing of existing frequencies, particularly in the mid-band or 3-6 GHz range, said officials familiar with the matter.
""We are looking to make available additional spectrum for mobile use in the coming five years,"" said one of the officials, who did not wish to be identified.
The DoT believes there is a need to provide more airwaves, especially in mid-band, for upgradation of 5G technology and introduction of 6G, which is expected to be launched by 2030. Most of the spectrum is currently being utilised by domestic legacy users such as defence forces and satellites, which may be shifted to different frequencies.
The Union cabinet on Thursday approved setting up of a committee of secretaries (CoS) to work on refarming of spectrum. The panel will comprise various departmental secretaries and senior officers of the DoT. The chairman of the CoS can also take assistance from external experts if required, officials said.

""The plan is that the CoS shall present its recommendations to the cabinet by the end of this year,"" said a second official. ""As per estimates, a quantum of 1.3 GHz of spectrum could be refarmed from such domestic users. At current reserve prices, it could be worth around ₹5.45 lakh crore,""
The cabinet on Thursday cleared the next round of spectrum sales in which airwaves worth ₹96,317.65 crore will be auctioned. The auction is likely to get a muted response, according to experts, with demand mostly from
Bharti Airtel
and
Vodafone Idea
, who need to buy back airwaves in some circles where their licences are expiring.
User Migration Likely Ahead
However, in the coming few years, the demand for spectrum is set to rise with wider adoption of 5G technology. In anticipation of increased demand, telecom operators have been seeking more mid-band spectrum for 5G and 6G use.
The industry has estimated a requirement of about 2,000 MHz of spectrum in the mid-band range in the next few years, up from 400 MHz available currently. Therefore, refarming is necessary to ensure the supply of spectrum.
""As part of the plan, the current spectrum will be vacated while the existing users will be migrated to alternative frequencies,"" said the first official.
The DoT has taken note of the World Radiocommunication Conference 2023, where several countries identified the 6 GHz band (6.425-7.125 GHz) as a potential band for 6G. However, in India, this band has incumbent satellite users. ""Refarming is required in the band, so that India can be in harmony with international norms,"" said a third official.

Anil Kumar Lahoti
, who said that more stringent regulation and implementation was needed to check the instances of
call drops
.
Lahoti, who assumed charge at the sectoral regulator Tuesday, told reporters that telecom is a sector where new challenges are coming every day from the point of view of regulation, and one must keep pace with time.
Asked about his priorities for the telecom sector, Lahoti said, “Quality of service (QoS), including monitoring of call drops, and facilitating growth of the telecom sector and providing them a level playing field.”
He added that QoS was a prime goal of Trai.
“Call drops are an issue...Trai has been constantly working on it. This is something where more stringent regulation and implementation is required. Whatever is possible should be done,” he said.

Lahoti added that the regulator will also ensure that the recently passed Telecommunications Act is properly implemented.
Trai will also work on improving connectivity inside buildings and how the construction and the telecom industry should work in tandem to provide ubiquitous coverage.
Lahoti has assumed charge after nearly four months since the retirement of PD Vaghela. He is only the third non-IAS officer to assume charge as the top official of the regulator.
Amongst the top most on the agenda of Trai will be to give pricing and other details for administratively allocating spectrum to satcom players – after the telecom department sends a reference - which could be done only when a chairman was in place.
Lahoti has graduated in civil engineering from
Madhav Institute of Technology and
Science, Gwalior and did his Master of Engineering (Structures) from
University of Roorkee
(IIT, Roorkee).
During his more than 36 years of career in railways, he has worked in various capacities over Central, Northern, North Central, Western and
West Central Railways
and in Railway Board.

"Verizon case may be delaying Starlink's satcom licence, too",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/verizon-case-may-be-delaying-starlinks-satcom-licence-too/articleshow/107155134.cms,26-01-2024,"Elon Musk-owned Starlink has US telecom company
Verizon Communications
to partly blame for the delay in securing a licence to offer broadband-from-space services in India, people aware of the details told ET.
Starlink's application is held up over mandatory ownership disclosure rules. The company has said the US privacy laws bar it from revealing full shareholding details of parent SpaceX because it is an unlisted company and instead gave a declaration that none of its shareholders are from countries that share a land border with India.
But the government is now cautious about accepting such declarations because Verizon last year gave one which later proved to be wrong, people cited above said.
While applying for renewing its internet service provider's (ISP) licence last year, Verizon Communications India had ""given a declaration - similar to what Elon Musk-owned Starlink has done now for getting a satellite communication licence - that none of its entities have shareholders from India's neighbouring countries sharing a land border,"" one of them said.
But the government later found out that the US company has some shareholding from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Hong Kong, which is part of China, in its entities, and told Verizon to apply through the government approval route for renewing its ISP licence.

""Even though the shareholding from these countries is less than 1%...still Verizon Communications India was advised to come through the government route, which it has agreed to follow,"" the person said. An ET query sent to Verizon Communications India remained unanswered at the time of going to press on Thursday.
The Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) in 2020 had amended the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy to make prior government approval mandatory for inflows from countries sharing a land border with India through Press Note 3. It mandates foreign companies investing in sectors such as defence and communications to submit complete shareholding details to the government. The companies need to notify the government also in the case of any change in shareholding.
Officials said in the backdrop of the Verizon Communications case, the government has become cautious in taking declarations or undertakings on shareholding for granting a licence.
The Starlink application for the global mobile personal communication by satellite services (GMPCS) licence is thus pending. The department of telecommunications (DoT) is now doubly cautious and has sought DPIIT's advice on whether to accept Starlink's declaration. Bharti Enterprises-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Reliance Jio's satcom venture already have the GMPCS permit to offer satellite broadband services. Jeff Bezos-led Amazon, too, has applied for a licence for its Project Kuiper satellite broadband venture.

"DoT slashes auction target, but revenue receipts to be robust",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-slashes-auction-target-but-revenue-receipts-to-be-robust/articleshow/107092848.cms,24-01-2024,"The Department of Telecommunications (
DoT
) has sharply lowered the
spectrum auction
revenue target for FY24 to a modest Rs 500 crore from Rs 5,000 crore estimated earlier, officials aware of the details told ET.
The department, though, still expects to generate Rs85,000 crore in revenue receipts this fiscal, the officials said.
They added that the upcoming auction, which the DoT is looking to hold in March, will only draw a few bids from
Bharti Airtel
and
Vodafone Idea
(Vi) for renewing their airwaves, and the total sale could fetch around Rs 2,000-Rs 3,000 crore, of the nearly Rs1 lakh crore worth of airwaves that would be up for sale. This would mark a sharp decline from the record Rs 1.5 lakh crore that the government raked in from the last
5G auction
in August 2022.
“While spectrum worth over Rs 97,000 crore will be up for sale, the operators may not bid much as 5G requirements have been fulfilled for the time being. The incumbent telcos would like to renew their existing spectrum holdings,” an official said on condition of anonymity.

Another official said a portion of the total proceeds in the upcoming auction will be generated this fiscal as upfront payment or the first instalment due to which the DoT has kept Rs 500 crore as the revenue receipts from the auction for FY24.
But despite a likely lacklustre auction, the DoT is expected to garner Rs 85,000 crore in revenue receipts for FY24.
“Due to revision of spectrum auction receipts, the overall revenue target from telecom sector for FY24 has been cut to Rs 85,000 crore from nearly Rs 90,000 crore earlier,” said the second official.
As per estimates, the DoT will garner Rs 50,000 crore from license fee and spectrum usage charge (LF/SUC) payments and spectrum instalments from past auctions. Around Rs 22,000 crore will come from adjustment of BSNL adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and Rs 11,000 crore from 4G spectrum for the state-run firm.
The DoT is planning to hold the spectrum sale in March as the permits of Bharti Airtel and Vi will expire in 2024 in some circles. Airtel’s airwave renewals this year are in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands in the circles of J&K, Odisha, Bihar, UP-East, West Bengal and Assam. Vi faces spectrum renewals in West Bengal (900 MHz and 1800 MHz) and UP-West (900 MHz).
In case, the auction is not concluded on time, or the spectrum validity has expired, the telcos will be given three months to continue using the frequencies with a condition that they pay in advance the reserve price of the airwaves for the period.
As per Jefferies, Airtel and Vi merely have to renew airwaves worth around Rs 4,200 crore and Rs 1,950 crore respectively, while market leader Reliance Jio does not have any spectrum renewal slated this year.
The DoT plans to put on sale all unsold spectrum from the last auction, barring the 600 MHz band.
The 600 MHz band remained unsold in the last auction. So far, there is no global harmonisation and identification of this band regarding IMT or mobility services. The DoT wanted to identify 600 MHz for IMT usage (5G services) during the recently concluded World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC) in Dubai, but it did not materialise due to opposition from China.
If the band would have been identified for IMT, it would have given an impetus to the development of the device ecosystem in the band.
When the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) was conducting consultations for 5G auction in 2022, most of the industry had underlined the lack of a devices ecosystem in the band. But since the band has great potential to improve wireless broadband connectivity, particularly in remote and rural areas, it was recommended for 5G.

Telcos push for D2M policy relook to ensure level-playing field,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telcos-push-for-d2m-policy-relook-to-ensure-level-playing-field/articleshow/106873328.cms,15-01-2024,"Telecom operators
have sought a reassessment of the
government
’s draft policy around establishing direct-to-mobile (
D2M
) networks to ensure a level-playing field, and have warned of the possibility of regulatory arbitrage if such a policy is implemented hurriedly.
The government is exploring a proposal for D2M networks that will enable beaming of TV channels on mobiles without a cellular data connection.
Telcos
have been opposing any hasty decision as the technology is still immature.
“It’s crucial to ensure that any D2M service implementation aligns with national legal and technical standards and does not result in regulatory arbitrage in providing the content services on
mobile
handsets,” the Cellular Operators Association of
India
(COAI), which represents Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea , said in a statement Monday.
The telco industry body has called for a re-evaluation of aspects around level-playing field, spectrum allocation,
network integration
and regulatory /cost arbitrage. It added that the spectrum envisaged should be allocated to service providers to provide D2M broadcasts as per market requirements.
The government has earmarked the 526-582 MHz band in the sub-GHz spectrum for D2M networks, which is currently being used by Prasar Bharati.
Live Events
“Building a dedicated D2M network by earmarking spectrum specifically for the broadcasting infrastructure providing competing/complimentary services would lead to breach of level
playing field,” COAI said.
The industry body has also sought clarification on the applicability of the D2M standards for currently available mobile phones, as none support the proposed standard.
The currently debated proposal is based on a proof-of-concept (PoC) undertaken by IIT-Kanpur to establish a roadmap for D2M. The institute had partnered with Saankhya Labs for all the hardware requirements including chipset, radio etc. IIT-Kanpur also released a white paper on the subject along with its recommendations.
To be sure, the government is yet to take a call on the issue as there is little clarity.
ET had reported in its August 5 edition that a proposal for D2M networks was being explored as the government felt there should be convergence for delivering content through broadcast and broadband, particularly with the launch of 5G services. The Telecommunications Engineering Centre (TEC), the DoT’s technical wing, is evaluating the adoption of ATSC 3.0 standard into national standards, which will allow broadcasting of TV channels and content on mobile phones, similar to broadcasting on TV.
As per its submission to TEC, the telcos had earlier highlighted that ATSC 3.0 had not gained much adoption globally. Besides, 3GPP, which globally develops standards for mobile telecommunications, has already included broadcast features in its release 17 for 5G broadcast.
Telcos also believe that all video content in broadcasting is already available on mobile, so TV content on mobile won’t be a big consumer demand driver.
Smartphone makers too have said that since a mobile device is designed for the global market based on 3GPP standards, it will be impossible to have space in the device itself to introduce new telecom generations of services like 5G, 6G, Satellite, etc. if manufacturers need to support legacy technologies indefinitely.

GNIpc is the dollar-value of a country’s final income in a year divided by its population. Accordingly, the lower the tariff as a percentage of GNIpc, the more affordable the services in that country.
Among comparable nations with a GNIpc of less than $10,000, India’s telecom
tariffs
are the second lowest at 1.11% of GNIpc after Brazil’s 0.92%, as per macro data collated by the International Telecom Union (ITU) and the World Bank. Telecom tariffs are much higher in South Africa (3.49% of GNIpc), Thailand (2.92%), the Philippines (2.32%), Indonesia (1.71%), Egypt (1.6%), and Bangladesh (1.4%), data showed.
There is a case for sharp tariff hikes by telcos such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi) in calendar 2024 as both Jio and Airtel are slated to complete pan-India rollouts of their
5G services
shortly, analysts said. Vi’s 5G rollout start, though, is pending as the telco is yet to close its much delayed fundraise.
The last significant sectoral tariff hike had happened back in November 2021 when Jio, Airtel and Vi had increased rates by 19-25%, they pointed out.

“Indian telecom tariffs are the most affordable in the world as per ITU database, which gives us the comfort that the country’s telecom services providers can increase rates by at least 1.5x over the next 4-5 years even as minimum data requirements grow, and still maintain the status of being the most affordable,” ICICI Securities said in a research note analysing ITU and World Bank data.
In absolute terms, India’s telecom services tariff is the lowest in the world at $2 per month while Brazil’s is significantly higher at $6.1 per month, as per ITU data. The absolute monthly telecom tariffs of other key economies such as China ($6.2), Philippines ($6.6), Malaysia ($9.2), US ($43.6), Thailand ($15.8), Mexico ($10) and South Africa ($19) are significantly higher. Even Bangladesh’s absolute telecom services tariff at $2.9 is higher than India, data showed.
Analysts at ICICI Securities said telecom tariffs have historically been inelastic in India, given the surge in overall data subscriber adoption and data consumption despite tariffs of popular mobile plans having risen 2x since July 2017 levels.
ET Bureau
India’s digital adoption (particularly for payments and entertainment) has been relatively high, implying that the functional value of telecom services has increased from just being communication solutions to multiple-purpose utility services, they said.
Analysts, in fact, believe that amid nationwide 5G rollouts, India’s top telcos will need to take tariff hikes soon to maintain their RoCE (return on capital employed) levels, amid a rise in their network operational expenditure (opex) and customer acquisition costs.
“Network opex per sub has inched up over the past few years and is now similar for Airtel and Jio at Rs 66/month, and we expect the rising trend to continue on 5G rollout costs,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report
It also expects telcos’ customer acquisition-driven SG&A (selling, general and administrative) cost increases to continue over the next few years despite some cuts in dealer commissions in FY24.
As per Kotak estimates, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue has increased for all telcos, but has risen the most to 11% for Vi in FY23. By comparison, Airtel and Jio’s have risen to 5.4% and 2%, respectively.

ET Explainer: What's a regulatory sandbox? How it spurs innovation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/et-explainer-whats-a-regulatory-sandbox-how-it-spurs-innovation/articleshow/106301521.cms,26-12-2023,"The Telecommunications Act, 2023, has called for the introduction of regulatory sandboxes (RSs) for testing new communications technologies and driving innovation. Sandboxing is also expected to encourage participation of startups and small & medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in coming up with relevant 5G use cases and going forward in 6G too. Rigorous live testing in a sandboxing environment is also expected to help telcos and tech companies spot glitches before launching new products commercially. But what exactly is a regulatory sandbox? How can it be a harbinger of tech innovation in the telecoms space? Here's an ET Explainer by Kalyan Parbat.
What's a regulatory sandbox?
A regulatory sandbox is a government-backed live testing environment where companies can safely experiment with new, untested telecom and tech products/services for a specific period. During such tests, companies will have access to live data and a limited number of subscribers to assess if the products are reliable and can be deployed at a mass level.
During such pre-launch live testing of products/services before a limited group of people, the government can, typically, relax the regulatory drill that companies would need to meet at a commercial launch of products/services for the wider market.
Why are regulatory sandboxes vital for developing 5G/6G technologies, use cases?
Development of 5G/6G use cases and tech, including AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) requires inter-sectoral and multi-stakeholder collaborations. A regulatory sandbox can provide a platform where telcos, gear makers, app developers, academics, scientists and regulators can work together, test and develop cutting-edge products that can be commercially successful in the mass market. Multiple central ministries, states, municipalities, smart city authorities can also participate in such sandboxing to test reliability and commercial viability of 5G/6G use cases, enterprise apps.
Why are sandboxes vital for tech startups and SMEs?
In a vibrant sandboxing environment, tech startups and SMEs can gain access to mentorship, funds, and technical resources to comprehensively test and develop compelling, commercially viable 5G/6G apps, use cases. This is vital as telecoms is a capital-intensive industry and failure to commercialise a product/service after testing can pose big financial challenges for start-ups/SMEs.

Have regulatory sandboxes been deployed in other sectors in India?
Yes. Regulatory sandboxes are most prevalent in the banking and fintech sectors which deal with reams of sensitive financial data/transactions and the chance of fraud and cyberattacks run high. The RBI and Sebi have already issued guidelines for safe testing of innovative financial products such as mobile banking apps, digital wallets, blockchain based solutions. A controlled sandboxing environment, typically, allows banks to test financial products without risking the security of their internal systems and customers.
How have telcos reacted to the idea of regulatory sandboxes?
Telcos want clarity about government funding via grant/budgetary support in regulatory sandbox (RS) regulations for telecom industry. This is because an RS environment will require live telecom networks/data sets for product testing that will involve costs. Besides, telcos want the regulations to address privacy and security aspects to ensure private information riding on participating telco networks as well as customer interests are not compromised.
Telcos also don't want to be corralled into RS endeavours, and say any involvement must be purely discretionary based on their own commercial interests and use case development needs.

Telecommunications Bill gets President's assent,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telecommunications-bill-gets-presidents-assent/articleshow/106273227.cms,26-12-2023,"New Delhi: The landmark
Telecommunications Bill
, which was passed by
Parliament
recently, has received the President's assent. 'The Telecommunications Act, 2023' is set to overhaul the country's century-old telecom law to make the sector investor-friendly; it prioritises user protection but also extends powers to the government to intercept communications.
While it excludes from its ambit broadcasting, and over-the-top services such as
WhatsApp
and
Telegram
, it cements rules for
spectrum allocation
and provides for a non-auction route for assigning airwaves for satellite-based communication services.
The legislation - which allows the government to temporarily take control of telecom services in the interest of national security - was cleared by the Lok Sabha on December 20, and by Rajya Sabha on December 21.
It supersedes the existing and archaic regulatory framework for the telecommunication sector, based on the Indian Telegraph Act, of 1885, the Wireless Telegraphy Act (1933), and the Telegraph Wires (Unlawful Possession) Act (1950).
""The following Act of Parliament received the assent of the President on the 24th December, 2023 and is hereby published for general information...,"" according to a gazette notification.

The structural reforms envisaged under The Telecommunications Act, 2023 aim to streamline what has so far been a complex licensing system in the telecom sector and instead ushers-in a simple authorisation mechanism.
It replaces over 100 types of licences with authorisation focussed on three aspects -- providing telecommunication services, operating and expanding telecommunication networks and possessing radio equipment.
""It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint and different dates may be appointed for different provisions of this Act and any reference in any such provision to the commencement of this Act shall be construed as a reference to the commencement of that provision,"" it said.
The bill has attempted to tighten noose on pesky callers through various means including by checking misuse of sim. Impersonation and acquisition of SIM fraudulently using someone else's identity proof for telecom services will be punishable with imprisonment for a term up to three years and a fine of up to Rs 50 lakh.
It also lays down similar stringent provisions for phone number spoofing for fraud, and moots an ""digital-by-design"" online grievance redressal mechanism for addressing users' complaints.
Telecom operators have been mandated to capture verifiable biometrics data when they issue a new connection.
The Telecommunications Act gives legislative backing to resolve disputes between consumers and telecoms through an online dispute resolution mechanism established by the centre.
The proceedings carried out by the online dispute resolution mechanism or outcome will not affect the rights of consumers under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.
It also addresses issues of continuity of telecom service which may help in cases where a telecom operator for some legal-commercial or technical reason is unable to provide services.
The Act paves the way for administrative (non-auction) allocation of spectrum for satellite broadband services. It also has provision to take back unutilised spectrum before the expiry of permit to use it.
""The Central Government may, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, after providing a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the assignee concerned, determines that any assigned spectrum has remained unutilised for insufficient reasons for such period as may be prescribed, terminate such assignment, or a part of such assignment, or prescribe further terms and conditions relating to spectrum utilisation,"" the Act says.
However, it does not provide for refund of spectrum price paid by entities for its allocation.
Further, the bill brings in a state government-led dispute resolution structure, where the district magistrate and the district judge will decide right of way issues that are related to permits for telecom network roll out.
Anyone causing damage to the telecommunication network will be liable for compensation for the damage caused and fine which may extend up to Rs 50 lakh.
""Whoever provides telecommunication services or establishes telecommunication network without authorisation under sub-section (1) of section 3, or causes damage to critical telecommunication infrastructure shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine which may extend up to two crore rupees, or with both,"" it said.
The government has brought in procurement of telecom equipment from a trusted source within the new Act, which was earlier being governed through National Security Directive on Telecommunication Sector.
Also, the bill significantly lowers the penalty cap on telecom operators to Rs 5 crore; it was earlier as high as Rs 50 crore in a telecom circle level and Rs 1,100 crore at pan-India level.
To ease the legal dispute process, the bill also has a provision for voluntary disclosure of lapses by a telecom company and to correct the mistake by paying applicable penalties.

"Waiver provisions scrapped, new telecom bill may derail Voda Idea recovery: Experts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/waiver-provisions-scrapped-new-telecom-bill-may-derail-voda-idea-recovery-experts/articleshow/106190866.cms,22-12-2023,"New Delhi: The removal of a provision offering waivers of
licence fees
, penalties, and charges, etc in the
Telecommunications Bill
, 2023 has come as a damper for financially-struggling telecom operator
Vodafone Idea
(
Vi
), as it may make it tough for the company to raise funds, lawyers and analysts said.
The waiver provisions in the original draft contemplated a framework that would have allowed financially stressed firms like Vodafone Idea to be revived with fresh investment with any potential investor also factoring in a waiver of significant statutory dues.
Also read:
Vi hasn’t made much headway in clearing Indus Towers’ dues, says Gopal Vittal, MD, Bharti Airtel
“The proposed powers to waive off or defer payment of fees, penalty and other charges have been removed from the final bill. This would have a negative revenue implication and has likely been removed due to that reason,” Manmeet Kaur, Partner, Karanjawala & Co told ET. “This reduces hope for entities like Vodafone Idea to have any concession with regard to payment of dues.”
A government official said the provisions were removed from the final Bill because it could have given discretionary powers to the government, which could have created problems in future.
Live Events
In the original draft, it was contemplated that such charges could be waived off in certain situations in the interest of consumers, ensuring competition, reliability and continued supply of telecom services, or availability of telecom network or telecom infrastructure in India.
Abhay Chattopadhyay, partner, Economic Laws Practice, said the provisions in the draft Bill had contemplated a framework that would have allowed struggling telcos to be revived with fresh investment with any potential entity being entitled to see waiver of large sums of accumulated debt, allowing them to start afresh.
“Indeed, this appeared to be an attempt to sidestep the rigors of the Supreme Court of India’s judgment in the AGR (adjusted gross revenue) matters. However, the Bill that has been tabled in Parliament does not contain such provisions, and ergo, will make it harder for Vodafone Idea to attract the desperate infusion of funds that they need to revive and compete in the Indian market,” Chattopadhyay said.
Further, the final Bill has removed provisions around insolvency. The draft bill had proposed that a company undergoing insolvency must clear its dues, including licence fees, otherwise the spectrum allocated to the company could be taken back. However, the final bill has done away with the provision.
“This is likely because taking away spectrum, which is the most valuable asset, from a licensee company will hamper the insolvency resolution process. This has been the bone of contention in Aircel and Rcom (
Reliance Communications
) corporate insolvency resolution process wherein Department of Telecommunications has been opposing the resolution process until its dues are cleared,” Kaur said.

Speaking on the Bill on Wednesday, Vaishnaw said user protection is a key reform in this Bill.
Among others, he said this amendment will help in checking fraudulent issuance of SIM cards. Any violation or impersonation will entail three years of imprisonment along with fine.
The Bill provides for the authorization of licencing through a single window.
The telecommunications sector is a key driver of economic and social development and is the gateway to digital services and the security of the country is vitally dependent on safety of telecommunication networks.
Telecom being the gateway, the Bill will further enhance India's digital public infrastructure, Vaishnaw added.
The current legal framework is governed by three laws enacted in 1885, 1933 and 1950.
The bill provides a framework for standards and conformity assessment of telecommunication equipment, telecommunication identifiers, telecommunication network and telecommunication services and provisions for national security, public emergency and public safety.
The bill, which seeks to repeal two British-era laws, was passed soon after the House passed the bills to replace pre-Independence criminal justice laws.
Lok Sabha passed the three bills to replace the Indian Penal Code of 1860, Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) of 1973 and Indian Evidence Act, of 1872.
The Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita 2023, and Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill 2023 will replace the IPC, CrPC and the Evidence Act respectively.
Replying to the debate on the three criminal law bills, Home Minister Amit Shah said that these are in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.
Amit Shah said he is feeling a sense of pride for having the opportunity to change the criminal justice laws after a span of 150 years and pilot the bills in the House.

Leading voices of telecom industry, including
Bharti Airtel
MD and CEO Gopal Vittal, and
Vodafone Idea
CEO
Akshaya Moondra
, lauded various provisions of the Bill, especially those related to security provisions,
right of way
, and simplification of licensing among others.
""I would like to warmly compliment the government for introducing a progressive and forward-looking Telecommunications Bill in Parliament. The Bill suggests groundbreaking reforms by streamlining India's licensing landscape,"" Vittal said.
He said the Bill aims to simplify the current ""convoluted system"" that includes various types of licensing (license, registration, permission), into a ""more cohesive and efficient"" authorisation-based regime.
Telecom Bill 2023 tabled in Lok Sabha, Oppn claims data encryption policy could trigger leaks
Telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, on Dec 18, 2023, introduced the Telecommunications Bill, 2023, in the LS. The new bill has removed over-the-top (OTT) services and apps from the definition of telecommunication services. The government has also proposed administrative allocation of spectrum for satellite services. The bill empowers the government to suspend or prohibit the use of telecom equipment from countries or a person as may be notified in case of national security threat.
""The seminal spectrum reforms initiated in 2021 eliminated SUC for future spectrum assignments and provided the option of moratorium of past spectrum dues and annual spectrum roadmap. These reforms have now gained further momentum under the proposed Telecommunications Bill 2023,"" he said.
The proposed legislation ensures predictability and availability of spectrum covering aspects such as refarming, harmonisation and trading/leasing/sharing. This, he said, will lead to the creation of a robust digital infrastructure and increased penetration of services, benefitting all Indians.
Live Events
The captains of the telecom industry also appreciated the reforms related to Right of Way (RoW).
""The proposed reform on RoW is yet another seminal move that is set to accelerate the rollout of telecom infrastructure, including 5G in the country. The move will provide the necessary enforceability of central RoW rules at the local level,"" Vittal said.
The provisions related to public and private property, common ducts further instill confidence in the industry for faster rollout, he added.
According to him, another pivotal reform involves the restructuring of penalties, as the government simplifies the penalty framework regime under the proposed Bill.
This will be achieved through a tiered system of graded penalties proportionate to the breach.
""The introduction of a voluntary undertaking and an appeal process within the government aims to mitigate litigations thereby promoting more efficient resolution of disputes,"" he said.
Vittal said the government has rightfully retained oversight of telecom networks from a sovereign security perspective, a requirement integral to India's telecom licences over the last two decades.
Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra described the Telecommunications Bill, 2023, as a watershed moment in the telecom reform process and said it reaffirms the the government's commitment to provide Indian telecom with a future-fit framework that helps achieve the growth aspirations of new India.
""The Bill carries several forward-looking provisions that will help deliver the benefits of digital connectivity to all our citizens. We warmly welcome the rationalisation of penalties and the legal enforceability of right of way provisions, a long-standing request of the industry,"" he said.
Security of telecom networks is paramount, and the Bill recognises telecom as critical infrastructure and prescribes punitive consequences for those who damage it, he said.
""By highlighting the duties of users, the Bill puts equal responsibility on consumers to meet the requirements of national security,"" he said.
The government on Monday introduced a new telecom Bill in the Lok Sabha, which seeks to allow the authorities to temporarily take control of telecom services in the interest of national security, provide for a non-auction route for allocation of satellite spectrum and drop OTT in the definition of services.
The Telecommunications Bill, 2023, proposes that the Centre will take temporary possession of telecom networks in case of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety.
The Bill proposes to stop transmission and intercept messages in case of public emergency, in the interest of the public, to prevent incitement for committing offence.
""On the occurrence of any public emergency, including disaster management, or in the interest of public safety, the central government or a state government or any officer specially authorised in this behalf by the central government or a state government, if satisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do, by notification - take temporary possession of any telecommunication service or telecommunication network from an authorised entity,"" the Bill said.
The Bill was introduced in the lower House by Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw amid a din over the Opposition demanding a statement by Home Minister Amit Shah on the Parliament security breach issue.

Telecommunications Bill
2023 is passed in Parliament, a senior government official said.
The new bill has removed OTT services and apps from the definition of telecom services and called for administrative allocation of satellite spectrum, ruling out auctions of such airwaves.
“The

The satellite sector said the new bill will help open the floodgates for billions of dollars in potential foreign direct investment (FDI) into India’s space and
satellite services
sector and also help price satellite broadband services at affordable rates.
“The new telecom bill empowers the government to allocate satellite spectrum via the administrative route as is the global practice and not through auctions…this lends clarity on the government’s position and will definitely enthuse global investors and spur FDI into India’s space/satellite sector and make the services affordable too,” T V Ramachandran, president, Broadband India Forum, which represents global satellite biggies such as Bharti-backed OneWeb, Amazon and Hughes, told ET.

The move will also boost domestic investment and spur innovation in the satellite space by encouraging the 189-odd space sector startups to boldly invest in new technologies, who would otherwise have distanced themselves had the government backed satellite spectrum allotment via auctions, he said.
The Indian Space Association (ISpA), a grouping of space and satellite companies, backed the view saying the decision to allocate satellite spectrum through a “globally harmonized administrative method” would spur growth in the nascent space sector, foster healthy competition and ensure a level playing field for all stakeholders involved.
“By allocating the spectrum by administrative method, India could align itself with international standards, promote global cooperation and also help drive innovation, create opportunities for startups, and strengthen the country's position in the global satellite market,” said Lt. Gen. AK Bhatt (Retd.), director general, ISpA. The government’s move would also drive growth in all “downstream sectors” of space, lending impetus to India’s space economy, Bhatt added.
Space industry regulator, IN-SPACe, recently said India’s space economy has the potential to hit the $44 billion level by 2033, and account for about 8% of global share from around 2% now.
Throughout the Trai’s marathon consultation process earlier this year, the industry was sharply divided on the mode of satellite spectrum allocation. Satellite biggies such as Elon Musk’s Starlink, Amazon, Bharti-backed OneWeb and Canada’s Telesat had strongly backed allotment of satellite spectrum through the administrative route, going up against telecom market leader
Reliance
Jio and Vodafone Idea (Vi) which wanted an auction.
“What’s the point of wasting everyone’s precious time by engaging in a protracted consultation process and seeking stakeholder views, if the outcome is determined even before the Trai consultation was allowed to finish,” said a top executive of a telco that had backed transparent auctions for assignment of satellite spectrum.
Separately, internet companies have welcomed the government’s decision to keep OTT players and apps outside the definition of telecoms.
“The bill is progressive since internet companies have been decisively kept out of the ambit of the final version…we had recommended that the ambit of the bill be limited to the network layer, thereby excluding the application layer,” said the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), which represents nearly 600 internet firms, and start-ups.
The association added that the time-tested distinction between telecom spectrum controlling entities (which are regulated) and spectrum using companies should be maintained as it has been the basis that has allowed innovation and deeper penetration of the internet in India.
India’s top telcos had been at loggerheads with big tech companies with the likes of Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea (Vi) calling on the telecom regulator to push OTT players to contribute to the creation of India’s 5G network infrastructure. They had suggested that this be done by bringing OTT
communication service providers
under the unified license (UL) regime. They had, in fact, called on the regulator to recommend that significant OTT players who generate maximum data traffic contribute to network costs that are now being shouldered entirely by the carriers.
Tech companies, though, had rejected telcos’ claims of OTT players’ free riding over telecoms network infrastructure, claiming on the contrary that the OTT service providers contributed to growth of telco revenues.
The new Telecom Bill has rejected the telcos’ suggestion, which has caused disappointment in telco circles. “Keeping OTT players outside the ambit of telecommunications will only continue to add to the national security risks they pose, especially with a host of commercial communications and messaging rapidly moving to OTT platforms,” said a senior executive of one of India’s top telcos.

The bill is likely to replace three laws: the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933 and the Telegraph Wires (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1950.
As per the Lok Sabha bulletin issued on Saturday, the President, having been informed of the subject matter of the proposed bill, has recommended introduction of the bill in the house under Article 117 (1) of the Constitution.
The government had issued the draft telecom bill in September last year. Among other things, the bill had specified that spectrum can be assigned through an auction or administrative process, depending on the requirements.
The draft also enlarged the definition of telecommunication services, bringing over-the-top (OTT) services such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, satellite-based communication services, internet and broadband services, in-flight and maritime connectivity services, etc, under the ambit of the proposed law. However, after the industry raised concerns, OTTs have been removed from the definition of telecommunications.
Telecom operators have been demanding that OTT players should be regulated as they offer the same set of services.
The original draft bill had made some provisions around Trai, which were later removed from the revised draft after the regulator raised objections.

“The PLI scheme for telecom and networking products was launched in June, 2021…within a short span, it has catalysed production of telecom equipment in India,” Chauhan told Rajya Sabha.
Elaborating on the progress levels of the telecom gear PLI scheme, he said that of the Rs 2,37,807 crore incremental sales committed by applicants, as much as Rs 38,999 crore had already been realised till end-October 2023. The scheme has also generated as many as 15,561 fresh jobs out of the targeted 44,494, he added.
The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) had originally notified the PLI scheme for telecom and networking products two years ago with an outlay of Rs 12,195 crore. Subsequently, it was amended in April 2022 to facilitate design-led manufacturing with an additional incentive rate of 1% over and above existing incentive rates. Some Rs 4,000 crore from the Rs 12,195 crore had been set aside for this.

The
telecom PLI
scheme was extended by a year as most selected companies had failed to achieve the production targets due to Covid-related supply chain disruptions. Under the revised PLI for telecom gear, 42 companies were selected, including 28 micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs).
The scheme offers incentives in the range of 4% to 7% for different categories and years. For MSMEs, a 1% higher incentive is proposed in the first three years.
Telecom products manufactured locally under the PLI scheme are exported to many countries.
To boost local manufacturing of telecom equipment, the government had reportedly tightened rules on customs duty payments by gear importers in a bid to plug leakages. This has lent a fillip to local manufacturing of routers, modems, set-top boxes amongst others.
The Centre has also allowed companies to claim benefits for making 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) equipment. Top telcos such as
Reliance Jio
and
Bharti Airtel
are betting big on FWA to monetise 5G.

DoT revises methodology for levying spectrum charges on captive users,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-revises-methodology-for-levying-spectrum-charges-on-captive-users/articleshow/105942939.cms,13-12-2023,"To promote ease of doing business, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has revised the methodology to levy
spectrum charges
on captive users, rationalising fees paid by such players. As per officials, the DoT will now be charging for spectrum based on area as against the number of devices earlier.
""We have simplified the whole process and introduced the new concept of area-based pan-India captive category. The rates have also been rationalised for most captive users,"" a DoT official told ET.
The move is likely to benefit captive users like
Railways
,
ONGC
,
BHEL
, mining industry etc. The DoT will also give three months grace time for setting up networks by such players and no spectrum charges will be levied for the period.
As per an order issued on December 11, the DoT said, ""A construction period of three months is permitted for the purpose of import of the equipment, site preparedness, deployment, etc. and spectrum charges be levied, after three months period from the 1st day of the month of date of issue of letter of intent (Lol).""
The revised charges will come into effect from April 1 next year. Spectrum charges comprises royalty and licence fee and shall be calculated for terrestrial broadcasting service, land mobile service (up to 375 kHz), maritime mobile service, aeronautical service, radar under radionavigation service and radiolocation service, fixed and mobile service (multi-channels multiplexed) and satellite-based services.

Digital revolution in telecom: India to eliminate physical verification process for SIM cards,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/digital-revolution-in-telecom-india-to-eliminate-physical-verification-process-for-sim-cards/articleshow/105760939.cms,05-12-2023,"In a move that will cheer India’s telcos, the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) is doing away with the costly and time-consuming method of physically verifying customer details before selling mobile connections from January 1, 2024. The move is also aimed to rein in
SIM fraud
.
“Considering various amendment/changes made in the existing
KYC
(Know Your Customer) framework from time to time, it has been decided that the use of paper-based
KYC process
, as envisaged in instructions, dated 09.08.2012, shall be discontinued with effect from 1.1.2024,” DoT said in a notification Tuesday.
Industry
executives said the decision to scrap the paper-based KYC and go digital for mobile user enrollments would cut telcos’ customer acquisition costs and also help the government check
SIM
fraud.
Enrollment of mobile users via the paper-based customer verification system involved filling up of customer acquisition forms (CAFs), pasting photographs as well as annexing proof of identity (Pol) and proof of address (PoA) documents with the form.
Back in August 2023, the DoT had tightened rules around verification needs for customers seeking mobile phone numbers, and for point of sale (PoS) entities appointed by telcos, as part of efforts to curb fraud and phishing. It had then said that it had come to the government’s notice that mobile connections were sometimes obtained by fraudsters in connivance with Point of Sale (PoS) entities, and were being misused to commit cybercrime/fraud.

India caught in the crossfire of Sino-US battle for 6 GHz,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/india-awaits-global-body-call-on-6-ghz-amid-sino-us-battle/articleshow/105664380.cms,02-12-2023,"While the US and
China
are battling it out over 6GHz
spectrum
on the global stage and India has been caught in the crossfire. The ITU World Radiocommunication Conference 2023 (WRC-23), currently in Dubai, will decide if the band will be used for mobility as what India’s telcos want or be delicensed for WiFi as demanded by the tech majors.
While the US, which has delicensed the entire band, is pushing for a resolution in its favour, China, which has allocated the band for 5G/6G mobile use, wants the opposite. India, on its part, has not taken a stand so far, but officials said that on certain occasions the Indian delegation has opposed the Chinese proposal, causing alarm bells to ring among telcos.
Operators point out that if the band is delicensed, there won’t be enough spectrum left in the mid-band for 5G and 6G in future. Further, the telcos point out that a Department of Telecommunications (DoT) committee had earlier recommended that the upper portion of the 6 GHz band (6.425-7.125 GHz) should be used for international mobile telecommunications (IMT) or mobility usage, while a call around lower portion (5.925-6.425 GHz) delicensing can be taken at a later stage.
The DoT committee had also acknowledged the requirement for an additional 2 GHz of spectrum needs for IMT by Indian telcos.
Live Events
However, the technology industry is pressing for delicensing the entire 6 GHz band for WiFi. Tech industry lobby Broadband India Forum (BIF) has written to authorities in India to delicense the band along the lines of countries like the US.
The entire 6 GHz band, between 5.925 GHz and 7.125 GHz, consists of 1200 MHz spectrum. The WRC-23 is to consider identification of the upper 6 GHz band for IMT. At present, the 6 GHz band is partly used for the Indian Space Research Organisation’s satellite operations. The prize 6 GHz offers is huge. It can support Internet speeds of up to 10 Gbps, like 5G speeds, or up to 100 times faster than 4G.
The telecom operators point out that the US market can’t be compared with India as they have a very high level of fibre infrastructure, and the population density is very low. “US mobile operators don’t require a big quantum of mid-band spectrum. But in India, the situation is totally different. Here mobile is the primary source of broadband for most people,” said an executive with one of the telcos.
Though China has much better fibre infrastructure compared to India, they have reserved 6 GHz band for mobile use as it is necessary to serve a large population with 5G/6G services.
Not only that, if the band is delicensed, the Indian exchequer will suffer loss to the tune of Rs 3.8 lakh crore.
Global telecom operators’ body GSMA too has expressed concerns over India’s interventions regarding the 6 GHz spectrum band during the WRC-23 and has requested communications minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to direct the Indian delegation to support the mid-band for IMT.
In a letter to Vaishnaw on November 27, GSMA Director General Mats Granryd said, “We are concerned that India’s interventions on this issue thus far at WRC-23 do not reflect the technical work already done globally to support the use of the band for IMT and could negatively impact progress in expanding mobile capacity.”
GSMA said studies show that India will require more mid-band spectrum to continue its strong start to 5G and WRC-23 is an opportunity for the DoT to take positive steps in that regard.
“The 6 GHz band is the only large contiguous block of mid-band spectrum that can deliver affordable 5G services and provide an opportunity to build a spectrum roadmap going into 2030. It will be very challenging for India to achieve 2 GHz of mid-band spectrum without the 6 GHz band,” the letter said.

"Telcos seek more airwaves for smooth 5G services, 6G rollout",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telcos-seek-more-airwaves-for-smooth-5g-services-6g-rollout/articleshow/105468531.cms,24-11-2023,"The
telecom industry
has urged the government to make available more
airwaves
for smooth delivery of
5G
and
6G
services.
“The telecom industry needs around 2 GHz in mid-band for 5G/6G use by 2030,” SP Kochhar, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), told ET.
The best suited spectrum for 5G and 6G is mid-band, and if the requirement can be met through c-band (3.3-4.2 GHz), which is part of mid-band, it is good, but since a good quantum of spectrum is currently being used by defence and other purposes, and the likelihood of getting the airwaves is bleak, the entire 6 GHz spectrum can be utilised for international mobile telecommunication (IMT) or mobility.
“When it comes to 5G/6G, 6 GHz is most suited, as it has the same characteristics as that of 5G spectrum auctioned last year in the 3.3 GHz band,” Kochhar said.
Airwaves between 1GHz and 6 GHz are termed as mid-band. Currently, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies are delicensed and utilised for WiFi, while identification for 6 GHz is underway. If the band is identified for IMT,
telcos
can buy it in auction for their
5G/6G needs
. But the technology industry wants the band to be delicensed for WiFi usage.

Telecom companies, however, say that if the band or certain quantum of it is delicensed, the telcos will suffer as there won’t be enough spectrum for them to meet their connectivity needs, particularly when 5G matures and 6G is being rolled out.
“With carrier aggregation, the same set of frequencies can be used for 5G/6G,” Kochhar said. “Giving 6 GHz band for IMT will provide a good quantum of airwaves to telcos to meet their needs.”
The available mid-band spectrum in the 6 GHz band (5925-7125 MHz) i.e., 1,200 MHz of spectrum, has immense potential in IMT for commercial success and deployment of 5G and 6G in the future, COAI said.
The demands from both the telecom and tech industry come in the wake of ITU World Radiocommunication Conference 2023 (WRC-23), currently on in Dubai, which may decide on identifying a certain quantum for 6 GHz usage.
The technology industry, however, cites the examples for countries like the US, where the entire 6 GHz has been delicensed for WiFi usage. But Kochhar junked these demands, saying the US and India can’t be compared. In the US, the entire c-band is given for 5G, but that is not the case in India, where a portion in the band is used by the defence forces and broadcasters.

"ET Explainer| LEO, MEO & GEO: The dawn of a new broadband era?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/leo-meo-geo-the-dawn-of-a-new-broadband-era/articleshow/105118359.cms,10-11-2023,"Bharti-backed
OneWeb
recently said it can launch fast broadband services in India using its low earth orbit (
LEO
) satellite constellation as early as end-November.
Reliance
Jio too said it can roll out JioSpaceFiber services using its Luxembourg-based JV partner, SES’s medium earth orbit (
MEO
) satellite constellation within weeks of being allotted the spectrum.
US-based Hughes already offers satcom services in India using geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite systems while Elon Musk’s Starlink is revving up to launch internet-from space services using its
LEO satellites
once it has necessary approvals from the Indian government. But what are LEO, MEO and
GEO
satellite constellations? And what is their role in providing broadband connectivity in remote and inhospitable regions?
Here’s an ET explainer.
Simply put, these are global satellite systems that operate at very different altitudes above the earth’s surface and can be used to provide high-speed broadband in remote and inaccessible regions where it’s a challenge to roll out terrestrial networks (read: landline and mobile networks).
How far are these satellite constellations from earth?
As per International
Telecom
Union (ITU) and Trai data, LEO satellites operate in space, less than 2,000 km above the earth, MEOs operate between 2,000 and 20,000 km above while GEO satellites operate from far greater distances, almost 36,000 km above the earth.

How do the different orbital positions of these satellite systems define their operational scope?
A long-distance GEO satellite can cover a larger area, almost an entire country like India, with a single, wide beam. By contrast, LEO and MEO satellites operate through narrow beams, with roughly 250 km spans, as they orbit much closer to the earth. As a result, many LEOs and MEOs would be required to provide comprehensive satellite broadband coverage across India.
How much do these satellites cost?
LEO and MEO satellites are much smaller in size than GEOs, and hence a lot cheaper. LEO/MEO satellites cost around $45/$100 million apiece while the bigger GEO satellite could cost almost $400 million.
Why all the global buzz around LEO/MEO satellites?
Due to their closer proximity to earth, LEO/MEO satellites are ideal for delivering low latency, fast broadband connectivity in remote locations, maritime broadband and in-flight broadband services. Latency levels are as little as 2-27 milliseconds (ms) in case of broadband connectivity via LEO satellites, while it would be a tad higher for MEOs (27-477 ms) and GEOs (above 477 ms). A millisecond is 1/1,000th of a second.
Broadband connectivity via LEOs offers almost 5G-like data speeds. That's why OneWeb (that recently merged into France’s Eutelsat), Starlink, Amazon’s Project Kuiper and Canada's Telesat have invested top dollars in LEO satellite constellations.
By contrast, GEOs require high-power ground terminals and face signal delays due to higher operating altitudes that can limit two-way communications. But, that said, GEOs are ideal for imagery and direct-to-home satellite broadcasts.
What’s latency?
Latency is a measure of the ‘lag’ (read: response time) that users experience when their computers/smartphones try to access internet servers on a broadband network. Lower latency connections would mean web pages load faster and videos start playing sooner.
What is typically the working life of GEO, MEO and LEO satellite systems?
The working life of a GEO satellite is almost 15-20 years compared to a LEO (5-10 years) and a MEO satellite (10-15 years).
Are LEO/MEO satellite constellations operational in India?
No. All satcom services are now delivered in India only via GEO satellites. But India's new Space Policy 2023 has allowed private LEO and MEO satellite constellation operators to launch fast broadband-from-space services in the country. This will start once DoT allocates satellite spectrum to LEO/MEO constellation operators.

Airtel calls for spectrum swapping policy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/airtel-calls-for-spectrum-swapping-policy/articleshow/104665961.cms,24-10-2023,"New Delhi:
Bharti Airtel
has written to the
telecom department
, seeking a more flexible
spectrum allocation policy
that allows spectrum swapping apart from auction and trading for efficient utilisation of airwaves, officials aware of the matter told ET.
A mobile operator should be allowed to swap airwaves held by it in one band with bandwidth available with the government in other bands, the country’s second largest telco has suggested, they said.
For instance, any telecom carrier should be allowed to switch some portion of its 1,800 MHz spectrum holdings with say the 800/900 MHz spectrum band available with the government, based on its business requirement while being revenue neutral or positive, it said.
Currently, such swapping is not permitted, and telcos can only sell airwaves within the same band to peers by way of trading. The validity of spectrum remains the same in case of trading.
So far, only
Airtel
has expressed a demand for flexible allocation while
Reliance Jio
and
Vodafone Idea
haven’t, officials said.

The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) is analysing the issue, they said.
Queries sent to Airtel remained unanswered at the time of going to press.
Airtel had earlier also written to the government, calling for a flexible
spectrum allocation
policy.
Allowing spectrum swap between different bands would need a policy change as the airwaves are auctioned band wise for a specified period, like for 20 years, one official told ET.
“We have to see if it is legally possible to take back auctioned airwaves before the validity of the spectrum ends,” said the official who requested anonymity.
“If a company wants to sell unused spectrum, it can do so by trading, depending on the demand by others,” the official added.
Airtel in its plea has said that due to various factors, some quantum of airwaves remains unused by a telecom firm, but the same spectrum could be useful for another company.
“So, the companies should be allowed to swap their existing holding of auctioned spectrum in one band with the spectrum available with the government in another band that fits the business strategy of a telco,” Airtel is believed to have written to the government, an official said.
Such a swapping can be done by paying the difference in the value of the airwaves, calculated based on the last auction price, it has suggested. In case the auction determined price is more than one year old, prevailing market rates can be determined by indexing the last auction price with interest rate mentioned in the latest notice inviting application for auction, it said.
“By facilitating the same, better utilisation of spectrum resource can be ensured without any loss to the exchequer,” Airtel said, as per the official cited above.
ITU-APT Foundation of India (IAFI), a non-government telecom industry forum, has also written to telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal, seeking a new policy for spectrum swapping.
“Spectrum is a finite and valuable resource. Spectrum swapping allows mobile service providers to optimise their spectrum holdings, ensuring that the available spectrum is used efficiently,” IAFI president Bharat B Bhatia has said in the letter, a copy of which has been seen by ET.
IAFI has stressed that spectrum auctions are a significant source of revenue for governments. “A well-structured
spectrum swapping policy
can help ensure that spectrum remains in productive use and generates revenue through auctions and fees,” it said.
Further, swapping can prevent spectrum hoarding by encouraging operators to relinquish unused or underutilised frequencies.
It has been highlighted to the government that with evolving mobile technologies, different spectrum bands become more suitable for specific applications. A spectrum swapping policy will allow operators to adapt to changing technology requirements quickly.
For instance, as telcos roll out 5G, they may need to swap or acquire new spectrum bands optimised for this technology.

"DoT decides to auction all unsold airwaves, again",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-decides-to-auction-all-unsold-airwaves-again/articleshow/104477479.cms,17-10-2023,"The telecom department has decided to put all
unsold airwaves
worth about Rs2.65 lakh crore on sale again at the same base prices as last year’s auction and without the addition of new airwave bands. The decision was made after the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) declined to provide a fresh reserve price for
spectrum bands
auctioned in July-August 2022.
The next auction is planned for January as some licenses of
Bharti Airtel
and
Vodafone Idea
are set to expire in February, said an official aware of the matter. This means that no new spectrum bands, including the 37 GHz band, will be auctioned in the next sale as the Trai has not announced any reserve price for these bands.
“We will auction at last year’s prices. In circle/circles which saw appreciation in base price, the auctioned price will be taken as reserve price,” an official said. The bands will be put to auction with the same band plan, block size and associated conditions as that of last year’s sale.
In the last auction, all airwaves – 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300-3670 MHz and 24.25-28.5 GHz bands – were sold at base price. The 1800 MHz band across
India
– expect for UP (East) - was also sold at the starting price. Only the winning price of the 1800 MHz band in UP (East) soared almost 80% over its base price as Bharti Airtel – whose permits expire in 2024 in India’s most populous circle – competed with
Reliance Jio
to protect its business.

Another official said the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) wanted to auction spectrum in the 37 GHz band along with the unsold airwaves but will now be forced to go ahead with a limited sale in the wake of non-availability of reserve price for the new band.
Frequencies in the 37 GHz band, ranging from 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz and 42.5-43.5 GHz, were earmarked by the DoT for auction. But since the spectrum would be sold for the first time, a reserve price needs to be given by Trai.
In a September 1 letter to DoT, the Trai said it won't be offering fresh recommendations on pricing or other modalities on any spectrum band except for the new 37GHz. The sectoral regulator categorically asked the DoT to use the authority’s recommendations given last year for bands ranging from 600 MHz to 26 GHz. It added that the DoT should auction the existing bands without waiting for the authority’s recommendations.
While giving its recommendations for 5G auction last year, Trai had factored in the fact that auctions would be conducted on an annual basis. Based on that, on April 11, 2022, Trai had recommended that for existing bands, a fresh spectrum valuation exercise be conducted once every three years.
For new spectrum bands - to be auctioned for the first time - a reference would be sent to the authority as and when these bands are proposed to be put on sale.
But DoT did not agree to Trai and reiterated that the recommendations are sent every year as due to the fast-changing techno-commercial ecosystem, spectrum valuation at shorter intervals may be desirable. Trai, though, has rejected this assertion.
The DoT now plans to go ahead with the auction on last year’s prices as waiting for recommendations of 37 GHz may not be feasible due to the impending expiry of licenses. Both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have permits expiring in February in some circles such as West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, and Odisha.
Analysts expect the sale is unlikely to see much bidding intensity with only two buyers, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, effectively in the fray, since the third private player, Vodafone Idea is struggling to survive amid cash flow turmoil.

Tired of call drops? Expect better quality service from telcos as Trai seeks to tighten rules,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/tired-of-call-drops-expect-better-quality-service-from-telcos-as-trai-seeks-to-tighten-rules/articleshow/104398603.cms,13-10-2023,"Consumers can look forward to better call and data quality, with the telecom regulator planning to tighten rules. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) is considering levying stiff financial penalties on telecom companies that do not meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements at state and district levels, in a bid to fix greater accountability, officials said.
Although the instances of call drops have reduced from the time telcos started rolling out 5G networks last year, the problem persists. “Still there are problems and that is why we have decided to relook at the present regulatory regime,” a Trai official told ET.
The regulator will finalise a new regime wherein penalties can be levied on telcos for not meeting QoS parameters on state and district levels, he said.
Currently, QoS is measured at the telecom circle level and if a few sites remain down for longer periods also, it does not get captured in the data as it averages out. If the accounting is at a district level, the data will be more granular, and telcos can be penalised in case even a few sites remain down for long.
The draft of the revised QoS regulations is already out and the rules will be notified after a stakeholder consultation. The regulator will also notify the QoS guidelines for 5G services for the first time.

However, the telecom industry is opposing Trai’s plans to measure data at state and district levels as the network is rolled out telecom circle-wise and the software system works accordingly.
The companies feel sharing data state-wise would be difficult because different jurisdictions are involved for different licensed service areas. Further, there will be difficulties in aggregation and coordination of data as it will require a new ID system to be set up that will entail cost and time.
On August 18, the telecom regulator proposed stringent performance benchmarks for service providers as it has been receiving complaints from subscribers over call drops and other network-related issues, especially after the rolling out of 5G services. The new rules are more stringent than those for 2G/3G networks.
In February, the Department of Telecommunications had asked the regulator to come out with updated QoS rules as the current ones have become outdated with advancement of technologies.
Apart from improving QoS, the regulator is working on to check the menace of spam calls and messages. Trai has asked the telcos to put in place a mechanism wherein spam and fraud calls can be curtailed.

6G
, or sixth-generation, networks once this super-high-speed
wireless
broadband technology becomes ready for commercial deployment in
India
, which is expected to be around 2030.
6G is slated to pave the way for fast
broadband
networks powered by
artificial intelligence
, allowing automated infrastructure optimisation. With data speeds potentially hitting 100 Gbps, it is estimated to be almost 100 times faster than 5G mobile broadband. 6G also promises improvements in network connectivity over 5G.

User adds, higher data usage to help telcos in Q2, Airtel may lead in ARPU growth: Analysts
Typical 5G use cases such as smart cities, smart factories, smart farms and robotics are slated to hit the next level in terms of efficiency. Experts say 6G will support all sorts of spectrum bands, including the higher terahertz frequencies, and use smarter antenna systems. Better handling of network interference and improved machine learning skills, in turn, are likely to propel 6G’s blistering speeds and low latency levels of 1 microsecond vs 1 millisecond in 5G.
Live Events
INDIA’S 6G AMBITION
Earlier this year, India kicked off its 6G act when Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a holistic
Bharat 6G
vision document. It says the country has the wherewithal to drive the 6G wave globally and leverage this powerful force multiplier to transform itself into a leading global supplier of advanced, relevant and affordable telecom systems and solutions.
More recently, India pulled off a coup of sorts on the 6G global stage, when the Geneva-based International Telecom Union (ITU) backed the country’s call for ubiquitous coverage/connectivity with 6G. Simply put, it means once the technology arrives in about seven years, network deployments won’t cost a bomb, promising affordable 6G fast broadband connectivity for the masses in data-hungry markets like India, including in rural, remote and sparsely populated regions. The ITU is a UN body that oversees telecom standards development worldwide. It is also the global agency managing spectrum and satellite orbit resources.
“ITU’s decision to accept India’s call for ubiquitous 6G coverage, and the successful integration of 6G ubiquitous connectivity into the IMT2030 (or 6G) framework is in alignment with the PM’s vision of implementing 6G in an affordable and sustainable manner,” said SP Kochhar, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents India’s private telecom operators,
Reliance Jio
, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
ITU’s acceptance also underlines global recognition of India’s 6G vision, positioning the country as an active participant in the evolution of the technology and formulation of international standards, he added.
“It is expected that India further supports the evaluation and final approval of the IMT-2030 Radio Interface Technology, according to the IMT (International Mobile Telecommunications) process,” said an ITU spokesperson, in a written response to ET’s queries.
The ITU, though, feels the development of 6G may be different in various regions of the world, even though the global agency has planned a timeline for final approval by 2030. India’s 6G ambitions got a further impetus after it signed a pact with the US to drive high-end research in the field at the recently concluded G20 Summit. Industry executives expect the memorandum of understanding between Bharat 6G and the US-based Next G Alliance to help India establish a robust 6G intellectual property (IP) framework that can increase the country’s influence in the global 6G standardisation process.
Sector hotshots expect the IndoUS 6G partnership to help boost the creation of 6G patents from India, especially since the country has set a national target of achieving 10 per cent of global 6G patents.
STANDARDISATION TIMELINE
Experts at U S chipmaker Qualcomm, which is at the forefront of the global 6G action, expect all specification work around 6G standards to start by 2025. This is likely to focus on 6G use cases and ways to address (network) architectural evolution and migration. Subsequently, the first 6G standard is slated for completion and ratification by 2028 to support targeted 6G commercial launches by early-2030.
The 3GPP, the global standards body that establishes each generation of mobile technology, will be closely involved in the 6G standardisation exercise. Separately, ITU’s World Radio Communications-2023 conference in Dubai next month will identify new spectrum bands from 7-to-24 GHz to meet future needs of 5G and, eventually, 6G.
The outcome of the conference will determine if a chunk of airwaves in the higher subterahertz band will also be available for 6G services worldwide. Advanced research outcomes, though, will determine whether 6G standards eventually develop support for the sub-THz/THz bands.
LOCAL 6G ACTION
India, with at least 127 patents acquired globally, is already a major contributor in 6G technology development. The country’s natural proficiency in softwarebased configurations, powered by AI, machine learning, deep learning and algorithms are seen as a natural fit, given 6G’s leanings on intelligent software technologies. So, even as India’s top telcos are busy expanding their 5G networks, the buzz around 6G is getting louder by the day.
For instance, Jio Platforms, which houses Reliance Industries’s telecom and digital properties, has already partnered with Finland’s University of Oulu to participate in 6G-related research and standardisation activity. Jio is investing in the initiative through its research unit, Jio Estonia.
Qualcomm is hopeful that 6G services will land in India virtually in sync with the targeted 2030 global launch timelines. “A costsensitive market like India, typically, waits for a new technology to mature, so that devices and network gear become commoditised, but since a lot of local manufacturing is now happening in India, it could lead to an early deployment,” a top executive at the San Diego-based chipmaker told ET.
Qualcomm is collaborating with operators and companies to develop 6G technology that addresses use cases for India, he added.
Nokia too has established a 6G lab at its R&D centre in Bengaluru that aims to position India as a key global contributor to the design, development and implementation of 6G technology. “Nokia’s lab will be a platform for future collaboration for industry and academic stakeholders on 6G and will facilitate the testing of new solutions while establishing their potential for commercialisation,” the Finnish telecom equipment maker said in a statement.
Nokia’s new 6G lab includes a setup to do research on ‘network as a sensor’ technology that enables the network to sense objects, people and movement without the need for on-board sensors. This is since a key objective of 6G and is bringing the digital and physical worlds together, the company said.
Last month, Sweden’s Ericsson has partnered with IIT Madras’s Centre for Responsible AI (CeRAI) to undertake joint research in responsible AI, especially since 6G networks will be autonomously driven by AI algorithms. “Our partnership with CeRAI at IIT Madras is aligned with the Indian government’s vision for the Bharat 6G program,” Magnus Frodigh , global research head at Ericsson, had said.
POTENTIAL DETERRENTS
India’s 6G ride, though, is scarcely expected to be a smooth one. This is since the ongoing slugfest between telecom and tech companies over the allocation mechanism for the coveted 6 GHz spectrum band is all set to erupt on the 6G stage. Telecom operators want the 6 GHz band to be auctioned and used for 5G services now, and 6G in future, while tech companies want it delicensed to boost in-building coverage and ring in affordable broadband services across rural India via WiFi.
“Allocation of the 6 GHz spectrum band is crucial for development of both 5G and 6G in India…licensed use of this band could expedite 5G and 6G deployments, fostering economic growth and digital inclusion,” COAI’s Kochhar said.
The Broadband India Forum (BIF), which counts Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel among its members, counters this view, saying indoor connectivity challenges will only get bigger with the advent of 6G, which would entail quality WiFi technologies offering complementary support to mobile broadband networks.
“To future-proof in-building connectivity in a 6G scenario, one would need access to cutting-edge WiFi-6E and WiFi-7 technologies, which entails delicensing the 6 GHz band, something that has already been recommended by the 6G Spectrum Task Force as a part of the Bharat 6G Vision document,” said BIF president TV Ramachandran.
Reliance Jio, in turn, has flagged challenges around aggregating disparate technologies such as satcoms, broadcast to Internet of Things for ubiquitous 6G connectivity. Satish Jamadagni, Jio’s head for global standards and technology development, reportedly feels standardisation bodies need to scale up to address some of these challenges as ubiquitous connectivity will force them to rethink the way network architectures are designed and developed, going forward.
Another likely deterrent to India’s 6G ambitions is the lack of adequate fibre connectivity. With less than 30 per cent of the country’s telecom towers now linked by fibre, the networks are ill equipped to support 6G data speeds, say industry executives. “Hundred percent fiberisation of towers is absolutely essential for 6G to be successfully operationalised in India,” said BIF’s Ramachandran.

"DoT rejects Voda Idea's objections on license fees worth Rs 3,273 cr for FY2015-17",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-rejects-voda-ideas-objections-on-license-fees-worth-rs-3273-cr-for-fy2015-17/articleshow/104204079.cms,07-10-2023,"The Department of Telecommunications (
DoT
) has disposed-off objections raised by
Vodafone Idea
in respect to licence
fee
demands amounting to Rs 3,273 crore for fiscal years 2015-17, putting the beleaguered company in further financial turmoil.
“DoT vide its communication dated October 4, 2023, has disposed-off the company’s representation and objections in respect of
license
fee demand of Rs 1,749 crore and Rs 1,524 crore respectively (including interest till March 31, 2023) for fiscals 2015-16 and 2016-17,” the company said in a regulatory filing.
Further, the company said DoT has not acted upon so far on its plea to correct the errors in
demands
up to FY 2016-17.
Vodafone
Idea said if it is permissible for DoT to modify the demands for the period covered by the judgment of the Supreme Court, then in that event there are various errors which need to be corrected and which would reduce the demand crystallized by the Supreme Court.
The company said it is studying the communication from DoT to decide next course of action.

The matter relates to adjusted gross revenue (AGR) verdict of the Supreme Court, wherein the apex court had directed older telcos including Vodafone Idea,
Bharti Airtel
etc to pay dues as per calculations of the DoT. An appeal by the telcos for recalculation of dues was rejected by the top court in July 2021. The rejection by the court meant that Vodafone Idea must pay AGR dues amounting to Rs 58,254 crore, of which it has paid Rs 7,854 crore.
Following the rejection, Vodafone Idea filed a review petition in August 2021 seeking directions from the Supreme Court to carry out correction of these errors and the same continues to be pending.
In the review petition, the company had highlighted that even inadvertent errors and additions by DoT to the AGR dues have not been allowed to be corrected. “It is a travesty of justice that the petitioner is restrained from questioning arithmetical errors/omissions, which are going to cost the petitioner approximately Rs 25,000 crore,” the telco said in its review petition.

"Satcom services to go live in India shortly, for demos to start with",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/satcom-services-to-go-live-in-india-shortly-for-demos-to-start-with/articleshow/104186641.cms,05-10-2023,"Satellite communication, commonly called
satcom services
, will soon become a reality in India, starting with live demonstrations during an upcoming event later this month.
The Department of Telecommunications (
DoT
) has given permissions to Bharti-backed
Oneweb
and Reliance
Jio
’s satellite arm to do live demonstrations during an industry event, which will give consumers first-hand experience around
satcom
services.
The two companies, which are holders of global mobile personal communication by satellite services (GMPCS) licenses, have also applied to the DoT to get test
spectrum
for doing trials on a wider scale for satcom services. The test spectrum is usually granted for a period of 90 days, but the timeframe gets extended if required.
Queries sent to Oneweb and Jio Satellite Communications remained unanswered at the time of going to press.
“We are analysing the applications for test spectrum from Jio Satellite and Oneweb,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Another official said the government is likely to give test spectrum to the companies as satcom has immense potential and India wants a leadership role in the segment.
Live Events
The satellite communications market in India is at a nascent stage but the potential is substantial, particularly in rural and remote areas. As per an EY-ISpA report, India’s space economy is set to rise to $13 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 6%.
“With test spectrum, the companies can check their networks as there is still no clarity around spectrum allocation for satcom,” said an executive with one of the
telecom
companies.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is working on finalising its recommendations on satcom spectrum allocation. Officials feel that once a new chairman assumes charge at
Trai
, the recommendations would be sent to DoT.
PD Vaghela retired as Trai chairman on September 30.
Officials told ET that though Trai has finalised auction models for satcom spectrum allocation, it is not yet clear if the regulator will recommend an auction mechanism. Administrative allocation also remains an option and the recommendations will be finalised after analysing the issue thoroughly.
Trai’s decision on satcom spectrum allocation would come amidst an ongoing slugfest between Reliance Jio and satcom firms. While Jio has been pitching for auction of satellite spectrum, Oneweb along with other satcom companies, want it through administrative route.
In its various submissions to government and Trai, Jio has termed satellites as base tower stations (BTSs) in the sky and highlighted about the principle of same-service-same-rules. Vodafone Idea too has been echoing Jio’s views.
The two sides have shared legal opinions with the authorities while pressing their demands. For instance, Jio has shared opinions from two former Supreme Court judges to support its demand of auction, satcom firms through Broadband India Forum had shared former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi’s views, who said auction isn’t the most appropriate and efficient method of resource allocation.
Experts believe that currently satcom services complement telecom services and can help to reach out to far-flung areas to provide connectivity but in future, they can compete as well.

"TRAI seeks stakeholders' views on assigning E-band, V-band spectrum via auctions",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-seeks-stakeholders-views-on-assigning-e-band-v-band-spectrum-via-auctions/articleshow/103997282.cms,27-09-2023,"The telecom regulator has floated a
discussion paper
, seeking stakeholder views on whether E-band (71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz) and V-band (57-64 GHz) spectrum should be assigned via auctions for mobility use and whether the valuation of these airwaves should be benchmarked to the price of 5G millimeter waves (read: 26 GHz band) discovered in the August 2022 sale.
In the paper, issued Wednesday, the regulator has also sought views on the overall scope of services/usage of E & V band spectrum resources as well as the charging mechanism if these are assigned via the administrative route.
Separately, the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
Trai
) has also invited suggestions on whether any plans to assign E & V bands for space-based communications should be pushed back to a later date.
“…auction-determined prices of mmWave bands for 5G, across all 22 licensed service areas is available from the recently concluded 5G auction in August 2022…it can be explored whether these prices can be used as a basis for valuation of E and V bands,” Trai said in its discussion paper issued Wednesday.
Trai has also invited stakeholder views on the quantum of E & V band spectrum needed to meet the needs of telcos for access or `mobility use’. It also wants to know if some of these airwaves are required by telecom firms not directly involved in access services as well as non-telcos for non-commercial/captive use.

Deadlines for comments and counter-comments are October 25 and November 8 respectively.
A slugfest has been going on between telecom and technology firms regarding the allocation mechanism of E and V bands. While operators have been seeking auction of spectrum in both the bands, Broadband India Forum (BIF), which counts Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Cisco etc, as its members, wanted delicensing of these bands, particularly the V band.
Telecom operators are, however, apprehensive that if these bands are given administratively, technology companies may enter the broadband market and utilise the free-of-cost spectrum to provide services to consumers.
Earlier this month, Reliance Jio had applied to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) seeking approvals to widen the use of
E-band spectrum
for mobility use, in addition to backhaul, stressing that with technological advancement, the distinction between the two had vanished.
Last year, DoT had given E-band airwaves to telcos administratively for backhaul use only to smoothen 5G rollouts. Backhaul has to do with connecting the core of a mobile network to nodes and then onto towers, to transmit data, elements that are critical for effective 5G mobile broadband operations.
In its latest discussion paper, Trai said it had received a reference from DoT back in August 2022 to give recommendations on the applicable reserve price, band plan, block size, quantum of spectrum, duration of assignment, scope of services/usages, spectrum cap, payment terms, eligibility conditions, auction methodology and other associated conditions for auction of E and V bands for establishment of terrestrial and/or satellite-based networks.
The telecom department also wanted Trai’s views on the allocation methodology, quantum and pricing of microwave access (MWA) and microwave backbone (MWB) RF carriers in 6/7/ 13/15/18/21 GHz bands for establishment of terrestrial and/or satellite-based networks as well as for non-commercial, captive, isolated use.
In the consultation paper, the regulator has sought feedback on the validity period of E & V band spectrum if these are assigned via auctions. It also wants to know about the need to create a provision for surrendering these airwaves, and the preferred lock-in period in that case.
The regulator has also sought views on the preferred carrier size for spectrum assignments in E & V bands. It also wants feedback on any need to assign spectrum in these bands in a way to ensure that if a telco acquires more than one carrier, all assigned carriers are contiguous.
In the event E & V band spectrum is assigned to telcos via auctions, Trai has sought views on whether operators acquiring such airwaves can be allowed to lease it on a P2P (point-to--point) link basis, to other entities for non-commercial/ captive or isolated use. “What could be the regulatory issues and potential misuse of such a regime,” Trai has questioned in the consultation paper.
Further, the regulator has invited suggestions on the need to prescribe any rollout obligations E & V band airwaves as well as the eligibility rules for such spectrum assignments.
In case of auction-based assignments of E & V band spectrum, Trai wants suggestions on the payment terms and associated conditions relating to upfront payments, moratorium period, number of installments to recover deferred payments and the interest rate for deferred payments and prepayments.
Trai has also sought feedback on whether the current method of levying spectrum fees for E band, MWA/MWB carriers on an AGR basis should serve as the basis for valuation of E & V bands as well as MWA/MWB carriers.

"Trai rebuffs DoT, says will give pricing recos only for 37 GHz band, not others",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-rebuffs-dot-says-will-give-pricing-recos-only-for-37-ghz-band-not-others/articleshow/103987296.cms,27-09-2023,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
Trai
) has told the
Department of Telecommunications
(
DoT
) to refer to its last year’s recommendations on
spectrum auction
for bands ranging from 600 MHz to 26 GHz for
reserve price
and other
modalities
and it will be only giving fresh recommendations for
37 GHz band
, which is a new band to be put on sale for the first time.
The regulator further said DoT may put to auction the spectrum in the existing bands ranging from 600 MHz to 26 GHZ without waiting for the authority’s recommendations for the new bands.
The DoT on August 2 had asked the regulator to furnish recommendations on reserve price, band plan, block size,
quantum
of spectrum to be auctioned and other conditions for sale of airwaves in bands ranging from 600 MHz to 26 GHz. Frequencies in 37 GHz band, ranging from 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz and 42.5-43.5 GHz bands were added for the upcoming sale.
Based on last year’s reserve price, the airwaves of existing bands are worth over Rs 2.5 lakh crore.
Trai has highlighted that in its recommendations dated April 11, 2022, it had factored in the fact that auctions would be conducted on annual basis. Based on that, it was recommended that for existing bands, a fresh spectrum valuation exercise be conducted once every three years.

Trai suggests sops to boost local telecom gear manufacturing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-suggests-sops-to-boost-local-telecom-gear-manufacturing/articleshow/103893106.cms,23-09-2023,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
Trai
) has recommended that the applicable gross revenue of telecom operators be reduced against the indigenous networking and telecommunications equipment (NATE) volumes procured in their respective networks.
In the list of recommendations on ‘Promoting Networking and Telecom Equipment Manufacturing in India’ released by the sector regulator on Saturday, it has also suggested the introduction of local value addition norms in performance linked incentives scheme (PLI scheme), tax relief as part of fiscal incentives, and setting up a dedicated master fund towards to address the relative cost disability faced by the industry, among others.
“It has been recommended that Government should follow a nudge approach and
Telecom Service Providers
(TSPs) should be incentivised to deploy indigenously manufactured equipment by reducing their Applicable Gross Revenues on annual net basis, by an amount equivalent to the aggregate certified value of indigenous NATE deployed in respective telecom networks during a financial year,” Trai said.
It has recommended the establishment of a dedicated master fund – the NATEDF - Networking and Telecommunications Equipment Development fund along the lines of the Electronics Development Fund (EDF).
This fund should provide for venture capital funding in public-private partnership mode to start-ups in need of accelerator support. “For the same, at least 15% of NATEDF's total pool of Rs 10,000 crores should be earmarked as Committed Public fund for Daughter fund(s) for innovation practice,” Trai said.

Trai also said that telecom software should be recognised as a separate category, and suggested setting up a dedicated fund,
Telecom Software Development Fund
. The initial committed corpus for this would be of Rs 1000 crore.
Trai has also suggested the introduction of a new scheme with specific provision to extend financial support to the industry towards procurement of fixed assets, plant & machinery, for new production units or capacity augmentation of the existing units which can be fashioned after the Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS).
“The salient features of the recommended scheme include extending one-time support up to 25% of the overall Capital expenses towards establishment of 'Plant & Machinery' for undertaking domestic production of telecom & networking equipment/components,” Trai said.
Broader Vendor Base
“To ensure that the entire scheme's budget outgo is not cornered by few big NATE manufacturers, it has been recommended that at least one-fourth of the scheme outgo should be to support applicant beneficiaries that are drawn from such MSME entities where eligible planned investment during the entire tenure of the Scheme does not exceed Rs. 50 Crore,” it added.
An enterprise engaged in manufacturing of NATE products and has met export volume of $15 million should be granted Self Ratification benefit under Advanced Authorisation Scheme (AAS) on deemed basis, it added.
“TRAI has recognised semiconductor fabrication as one of the key manufacturing activities in the indigenous manufacturing of electronics products including NATE. TRAI's Recommendations of 2011 had already recommended the establishment of cutting-edge fabrication facility by providing Government's fund support up to 75 %, where equity is capped at 49% and rest as debt,” Trai said.
In a separate circular on 'Improving Telecom Infrastructure in Northeastern States of India', Trai has recommended that state governments of Northeastern (NE) States including Sikkim should be engaged to improve telecom infrastructure in the region.
This includes harmonising respective state policies with the ""The Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules, 2016"", exemption of RoW charges rural, tribal, and hilly regions for a duration of five years, and waiver of the additional 25% 'Tribal Development Charges' being imposed upon telecom operators wherever applicable in the NE states including Sikkim.
Additionally, Trai has recommended that the states in the region provide electricity to telecom sites on priority, and waive or subsidize last mile installation charges for telecom sites.

TRAI recommends measures to boost telecom infra in North Eastern states,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-recommends-measures-to-boost-telecom-infra-in-north-eastern-states/articleshow/103890427.cms,23-09-2023,"TRAI has issued recommendations for bolstering
telecom
infrastructure in North East, suggesting parleys with the state governments to harmonise their respective 'right of way' policies with related Central rules, as well as favouring provision of electricity to telecom sites on priority at utility tariffs. The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(TRAI) noted that while a number of initiatives have been taken by the government to improve telecom connectivity in the northeastern states, there is still a lack of high-speed mobile-based internet and fixed broadband connectivity, mainly due to the inadequate transmission bandwidth (optical fibre, Microwave and satellite).
""The Northeast states continue to grapple with a significant digital divide due to various reasons such as inhospitable terrain conditions, poor availability of power supply, transmission media related limitations, poor return of investment prospects for TSPs, and Right of Way (RoW) related issues,"" the sector regulator said in a release.
The
Northeastern Region
(NER) comprises the states of
Arunachal Pradesh
, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura - together they form part of the East Himalayan region.
The latest recommendations by TRAI assume significance given that while average tele-density of India (as of April 2023) stood at 84.46 per cent, the teledensity in Assam state is 71 per cent and that of
Northeast Licensed Service Area
consisting of six states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura is 79.6 per cent.
The digital divide hampers the region's socio-economic growth, restricts access to essential services and information, and exacerbates the developmental gap between the Northeast and the rest of the country, TRAI noted.

Accordingly, the sector regulator has formulated its recommendations with an aim to enhance telecom infrastructure in the region, bridge the digital divide, unlock economic potential, overcome geographical challenges, foster collaboration, and ensure national security.
These recommendations will greatly strengthen the region's telecom backbone, enabling seamless communication, efficient surveillance, and effective border coordination, as per TRAI.
""Engage with respective state governments of Northeastern (NE) States including Sikkim to...harmonise their respective state RoW policy in line with 'The
Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules
, 2016' and its amendments thereon at the earliest,"" TRAI said in its recommendations to Telecom Department.
TRAI has also called for implementing exemption of Right-of-Way (RoW) charges in rural, tribal and hilly regions for a duration of five years.
""Implement waiver of the additional 25 per cent 'Tribal Development Charges' being imposed upon TSPs (telecom service providers) wherever applicable in the NE states including Sikkim...facilitate creation of enabling provisions in their policy to expedite accord of environmental clearance to TSPs for installing mobile towers and DG sets for tower locations,"" TRAI said.
State Governments there should provide electricity to telecom sites as a priority (within 15 days of connections request) at Utility/Industrial tariff.
Another recommendation is to do with waiving or subsidising last mile installation charges for extending electricity connection to telecom sites in remote and hilly areas.
""Respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) to spell out utility tariffs which should be lower than the Industrial tariff. Telecom Service/Infrastructure Providers should be subjected to such utility tariffs only,"" it said.
TRAI recommended that the Centre should provide budgetary assistance in the form of grant to the states (including those in NER) only for the purpose of assisting certain village-level government institutions in obtaining a
BharatNet
connection, procuring digital communication devices, and covering the monthly usage charges for connectivity.
""The grant should be divided in the proportion of 25:75 wherein the 25 per cent of the grant should be used by these institutions for procuring terminal end digital communication devices and 75 per cent of the grant should be utilised for paying the cost of connectivity and monthly usage charges thereof to BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd),"" it said.

Connected vehicles to boost e-SIM demand by 3 million in 1-1.5 years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/connected-vehicles-to-boost-e-sim-demand-by-3-million-in-1-1-5-years/articleshow/103851099.cms,25-09-2023,"Increased focus of automakers on
connected vehicles
is likely to spur demand for embedded sims (
e-sims
) by as much as 3 million over the next 12-18 months. This, industry experts said, would drive growth in enterprise business for
telecom operators
.
Experts predict the widespread adoption of e-SIMs in automobiles will quadruple the demand for
semiconductor chips
by 2025.
“We believe that the number of OEM (original equipment maker) fitment connected vehicles could increase by around 2-3 million over the next 12-18 months,” a spokesperson for
Bharti Airtel
said, adding that demand for e-sims is led by manufacturers’ focus on launching internet-enabled vehicles with connectivity and smart features at the core of the product offering.
Currently, the e-sim market for telcos is just less than 1% of enterprise revenues of telcos, according to industry estimates. However, with the rollout of 5G enterprise and increased uptake of Internet of Things (IoT), the share is expected to grow multifold over the next few years.
Live Events
Along with e-sims, the growing popularity of connected vehicles will also lead to a further increase in demand for semiconductor chips.
Sunjay Kapur
, chairman,
Sona Comstar
, said both regulations and customer preferences are changing, leading to increasing use of semiconductor chips in vehicles, and opening up more opportunities for component manufacturers.
“Four years back, people were apprehensive the shift to electric will render obsolete the components required for internal combustion engine vehicles. But today, 40% of the vehicle is software and this change has happened so rapidly,” said Kapur.
For instance, as much as 47% of the 50,000-odd customer orders for the facelift of Kia India’s Seltos sport-utility vehicle, launched in July, are for variants equipped with Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), indicating a growing preference for cutting-edge safety and technology features among buyers.
“The integration of technologies will intensify with the evolution of smart cars and 5G technology expansion. 5G will bolster semiconductor usage in vehicles, especially with the rise of 5G Standalone (SA) networks enhancing operations,” said Aditya Joshi, chief executive at OpalForce, a technology, semiconductor, and talent solutions company.
As per industry estimates, demand for semiconductor chips will grow fourfold to $100 billion by 2025, with the advent of IoT and 5G in India. According to the experts, a connected vehicle can have between 1400-3000 chips, clearly indicating that as demand for connected vehicles rises, so will the demand for chips.
Gaurav Gupta, deputy managing director at MG Motor India, agreed the company too has received a strong response to variants equipped with connected and autonomous technologies. ""As much as 50% of our customers refer to ADAS. Customers today are willing to pay for safety and opt for spec-rich variants even at higher price points.""
MG Motor India offers ADAS features in its SUV models--Astor, Hector and Gloster.
While semiconductor chips form a part of the hardware that provides vehicle telematics, e-sims provide integration with the telematics unit and have a longer lifespan as they can withstand harsh environmental variations such as temperature and humidity, thus making them more preferable over physical plug-in sims.
The transmission of telematic data like vehicle diagnostics to computers or mobile devices is facilitated by telecom operators, which is where the likes of Airtel,
Reliance Jio
, and Vodafone Idea can participate. “In the automotive segment, analytics around real time driving patterns and driver behaviour are helping OEMs build capabilities aimed at improving driver and passenger safety,” according to Airtel.
Jio and Vodafone Idea did not respond to requests for comment at press time.
The key to sustained growth in e-sim adoption in the automotive industry would be in ensuring supply chain efficiencies, experts said.
“With the challenge posed by the pandemic, there is a clear gap between demand and supply. Initiatives like lower import tax, single window clearance, and better warehousing will be crucial to sustain momentum,” said Pankaj Sharma, co-founder at Log9 Materials, an Indian nanotechnology company.

"Trai proposes over 50% cut in entry fee for licenses, rejects telcos call to scrap BGs",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-proposes-over-50-cut-in-entry-fee-for-licenses-rejects-telcos-call-to-scrap-bgs/articleshow/103796010.cms,20-09-2023,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
has proposed slashing entry fees for various licences by over 50%, a move aimed at promoting entry of new players in the sector. The authority, however, has proposed to continue with the practice of submitting
bank guarantees
(BG) for various licences, rejecting telcos' calls to scrap them.
All the three private telecom operators wanted the BGs scrapped, so that more working capital could be freed for expansion of mobile broadband networks. The telcos had highlighted to
Trai
that BGs should be discontinued as they don’t serve any purpose in securing government revenues but add imposing costs on them.
The regulator, however, felt that it was important to have some sort of a mechanism to guard against the vagaries of the telecom market. “Having bank guarantees has been such a time-tested mechanism,” Trai said in its recommendations on ‘Rationalization of Entry Fee and Bank Guarantees’ released Tuesday.
But the regulator has proposed to merge financial bank guarantee and performance bank guarantee, a move that will reduce the compliance burden of existing firms. “The merging of bank guarantees will encourage ease of doing business and enable licensees to make investments in the sector thereby ushering the growth in the sector,” Trai said.
When it comes to BGs, Trai took note of the telecom reforms announced in September 2021, wherein the requirement for submitting BGs was reduced by around 80%. Currently, BGs are submitted to the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) and in case the statutory dues like licence fees and spectrum usage charges are not paid on time, the government has the option to encash the BGs to secure payments.

To enhance the ease of doing business, the process for submission of electronic BGs should be adopted, Trai said.
Regarding entry fees, the telecom operators had proposed to continue with the existing structure, saying any reduction may open the sector to non-serious players and hamper healthy competition.
But the regulator felt the entry fees should be rationalised.
“Entry fee may have positive outcomes by deterring non-serious entry. However, entry fee may also act as a constraint by limiting competition. Therefore, it is desirable that the entry fee is set at a level that balances this trade-off,” Trai said.
Therefore, the regulator has recommended reduction in entry fees for various licences and authorisations. It, however, has decided not to change any entry fee for global mobile personal communication by satellite (GMPCS) and
VSAT
authorisations as the segments are expected to expand for the provision of satellite broadband services.
“It is expected that reductions in entry fee will lead to the entry of new service providers in the market, increase investment and enhance competition in the
telecom sector
,” Trai said.
The authority has also recommended no entry fee at the time of renewal of licence. Such a move will ease the financial burden on existing as well as new entrants, and will be beneficial for UL (VNO) licensees especially.
Further, the regulator has recommended no entry fee for M2M, audio conferencing and voice mail service, etc. Entry fee for unified licence (UL) authorisation for access service has been reduced to Rs 50 lakh from Rs 1 crore per telecom circle, while NLD and ILD service has been reduced to Rs 50 lakh from Rs 2.5 crore among others.

TRAI
on Tuesday recommended a cut in the entry fee for
mobile

for existing ones. In a sweeping set of recommendations, the sector regulator has mooted that the entry fee for Unified Licence (UL) in case of access service be halved, which along with suggestions of merging
bank guarantees
and other measures will ""facilitate the orderly growth of the sector"".
The measures will spur investment and growth, and in effect improve the quality of service and enhance consumer welfare, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).
""Entry fee for following UL authorisations should be rationalised...Access service from Rs 1 crore to Rs 50 lakh for each telecom circle/ metro area; from 0.5 crore to 25 lakh for J&K and North east each,"" TRAI release said.
For National and International Long Distance, TRAI has recommended that the said fee be reduced from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 50 lakh, while for Public Mobile Radio Trunking Service (PMRTS), it suggested reduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 20,000 for each telecom circle/metro area.
For internet service providers in the national area, TRAI recommended reduction in entry fee by a third - from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. For ISP category B it recommended reduction from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 50,000 for each telecom circle, and Rs 25000 for Jammu and Kashmir and North-East each.

TRAI has also recommended no entry fee at the time of renewal of licence.
""For Unified License, Financial Bank Guarantee (FBG) and
Performance Bank Guarantee
(
PBG
) should be merged into a single Bank Guarantee for securitizing the dues, to cover the violation of license conditions and to ensure the performance under licence agreement,"" TRAI release said summarizing the recommendations made to Telecom Department.
TRAI recommended the merging of FBG and PBG for
Mobile Number Portability
license, into a single Bank Guarantee, and favoured submission of electronic bank guarantee (eBG) for
ease of doing business
.
""In an environment of rapid technological transformation in the telecommunications sector, in order to facilitate the orderly growth of the telecom sector and Ease of Doing Business, TRAI has made recommendations to the Government for reducing the entry fees across various license authorisations and the merging of bank guarantees,"" TRAI said.
TRAI said the reduction in entry fee is expected to lead to the entry of new service providers in the market, increase investment and enhance competition in telecom sector.
The merging of bank guarantees will encourage ease of doing business and enable licensees to make investments in the sector thereby ushering the growth in the sector.

""The Authority has also recommended no entry fee at the time of renewal of license. Such a move will ease the financial burden on existing, as well as new entrants, and will be beneficial for UL (VNO) licensees especially,"" it explained.
In the telecom licences parlance, Entry Fee is a fixed one-time amount that prospective entrants must pay to enter a market. Entry Fees are typically non-refundable and constitute start-up costs for a firm.
A Bank Guarantee is a type of financial instrument to safeguard the interests of the Government as it ensures that the licensee pays its dues on time and fulfils their obligations as per the terms and conditions prescribed in the license agreement.

Graded import duty structure for telecom components on the cards,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/graded-import-duty-structure-for-telecom-components-on-the-cards/articleshow/103766537.cms,19-09-2023,"India plans to levy graded customs duties on
telecom components
to discourage imports and build a robust domestic
supply chain
as it aims to transform the country into a fully integrated global telecom gear manufacturing hub.
The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) is examining a proposal to impose an initial 10%
import duty
from January and raise it further to 15% by October next year on packaging items, antennae, WiFi switches, plastic/metal housing items, wires/cables, USB ports/connectors, power adaptors and other electrical/mechanical items, among telecom components, said officials aware of the matter. The import duties on these parts and timelines for their implementation are being considered under the government's Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) to drive local production and enhance value addition, the officials said.
The PMP aims to lend more depth to India's telecom gear manufacturing ambitions by initially incentivising local production of low value accessories and eventually high value components. It proposes to achieve this by increasing the basic customs duty on imports of such accessories/components.
ET reported on September 15 that the DoT is mulling bringing the entire gamut of telecom products used in fibre-based home broadband networks under an import licensing regime to boost local manufacturing and cut import dependence, mirroring recent moves on import of IT hardware.

If the proposal is cleared, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) will implement the import licensing regime that will mandate telcos to take relevant permits and seek prior government approval for importing such network gear, said officials.
The telecom industry, though, is resisting the latest plan to slap customs duties on imported components, citing the lack of an immediate local ecosystem in the country, which could throw up supply chain challenges.
""In the immediate absence of a robust local ecosystem for telecom components/parts, imposition of graded import duties on these items under PMP would push up the cost of finished products and increase network deployment costs for carriers such as Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and
Vodafone Idea
,"" a senior industry executive said.

5G
,
6G
,
AI
and

etc,
Trai
has proposed that such organisations should be registered at national level, with presence in multiple states and union territories (UTs).
Currently, such organisations are registered by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) state-wise as part of Registration of Consumer Organisations Regulations, 2013. Trai has now proposed to amend the regulations to register such organisations at a national level.
The regulator believes that consumer organisations can play a supporting role in raising awareness about the benefits accrued out of emerging technologies 5G, 6G, artificial intelligence (AI),
internet of things
(loT), particularly to the marginalised communities, people in rural areas for bridging the digital divide.
These organisations can assist Trai in conducting theme-based events, explaining the use cases of the emerging technologies, educate consumers of different sections such as women, farmers, fisheries, students etc. about their potential benefits, and also propagate cyber hygiene and make consumers aware of data privacy.
Releasing the draft Registration of Consumer Organisations (Amendment) Regulations, 2023 for stakeholders' comments, Trai said it felt a need to register national level consumer organisations, having capability and experience in campaigning and conducting theme-based events by developing awareness material can provide an interface between consumers and authority.

Trai
has reduced audit compliance of
licensed service areas
to once in year from four times earlier but it will cover maximum
tariff offerings
, including related to
international roaming
, according to the new regulations on quality of service.
""Each LSA shall be audited only once in a financial year unlike four times as per old regulations, thereby reducing the audit burden by almost 75 per cent,"" Trai said.
However, while simplifying the audit process, it is also ensured to cover maximum tariff offerings under audit unlike in previous regulation which has the provision for audit of 15 most popular tariff offerings only leaving aside a good number of tariff offerings with less number of subscriptions, the regulator said.
The new regulation shall now cover critical tariff offerings like related to international roaming, even with low subscriber base,"" Trai said.
The new regulations lead to the repealing of amendments issued in 2013 - then known as Quality of Service (Code of Practice for Metering and Billing Accuracy) Regulation, 2006, and its amendments issued on 25th March 2013.

The new regulations also mandate on refund of maximum overcharged amount to customers in a definite time frame and introduce Financial Disincentive (FD) as percentage of total overcharged amount from all similarly placed consumers, if detected during the audit.
Trai said it has also deleted provisions of self-evaluation for auditors, enhancing the time limit to 30 days for providing the raw CDRs to the auditor from 15 days proposed in the draft regulations, graded financial disincentives and modification in retention period for audit records for smooth compliance of regulatory provisions and to facilitate ease of doing business..
Trai mentioned that it has ensured a balance between two key objectives of protecting the interests of the subscribers by ensuring that service providers maintain fairness and transparency in their Metering and Billing System and reducing compliance burden on the service provider to enhance Ease of Doing Business (EODB).

IAMAI and CUTS write to TRAI highlighting concerns on OTT regulation consultation paper,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/iamai-and-cuts-write-to-trai-highlighting-concerns-on-ott-regulation-consultation-paper/articleshow/103256451.cms,31-08-2023,"Two industry bodies have made submissions to the telecom regulator with concerns surrounding its consultation paper on whether to regulate over-the-top (
OTT
) communication services, or apps, especially the matter of revenue sharing with telcos.
On July 7,
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
TRAI
) had kicked off its much-anticipated consultation process on the question of regulating over-the-top (OTT) apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal which pits the app makers and the startup community against telcos.
In its submission to the paper titled ‘Regulatory Mechanism for Over-The-Top (OTT) Communication Services and Selective Banning of OTT Services’, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (
IAMAI
) said that any “collaborative framework” which may result in establishing a revenue-sharing mechanism between OTTs and
telecom service providers
(TSPs) will violate the net neutrality framework notified by the Ministry of Communications in 2018.
It observed that the pending new telecom Bill also floats the idea of bringing OTT services under the ambit of telecom licenses.
""Such demands are based on the erroneous notion that OTT service providers consume bandwidth, and disregard the fact that not OTT players but consumers themselves independently transact and purchase data from TSPs,"" IAMAI said in a statement. ""Moreover, revenue-sharing mechanisms would essentially mean charging twice for the same service as consumers already pay TSPs for the data they consume.""

Further, the industry body said that in any scenario, the amount of data that is consumed – and the resultant ‘pressure’ put on the infrastructure of telecom service providers (TSP) – is directly dependent on the amount of data sold by telecom companies to consumers. It made a case that implementing revenue-sharing mechanisms would also mean adding a cost to accessing free or cheap content, which may eventually be passed onto consumers, thus raising the cost of internet usage.
Consumer Unity & Trust Society (CUTS) also highlighted this point in its submission to TRAI, saying that one of the risks with the proposed cost-sharing framework between OTT players and telcos, is differential pricing for different sets of consumers.
""This can impair consumer choice available to consumers for accessing services they desire,"" it stated. ""There is a substantial risk of increased cost to consumers if OTTs are required to share infrastructure cost, and should they wish to pass on the same, by imposing a usage fee on OTT services. The consumers will face double whammy of paying the TSPs for access to broadband and to the OTT providers for access to content.""
Further, CUTS said that there is a possibility of lower quality of services and increased latency, as well as potential effect of rise in data prices in India, if the proposed framework of regulation of OTT services is implemented. Echoing the sentiment of IAMAI, CUTS said that there is also the risk of internet fragmentation and a threat to net-neutrality while also possibly leading to a chilling effect on investment and entrepreneurship on an emerging sector.
But telcos have for long demanded that communication apps be regulated as they offer similar services without the security and financial obligations attached to a licensee. OTT players have argued they are already regulated under the IT Act and more rules will only stifle innovation.
In its paper, TRAI has listed 14 points. These include the definition of OTTs, OTT communications services, classification of OTT services, aspects of OTT communication services vis-à-vis telecom services. If they need to be regulated, what should be the framework to cover lawful interception, privacy, security, unsolicited commercial communication, licence fees etc., Trai has asked.
TRAI wants to determine if there is a need for a collaborative framework between OTT services and licensed telcos. But if this impacts net neutrality, the regulator had said it wanted to know what measures should be taken to address that. The regulator also sought views about technical solutions to mitigate the challenges that can come with the selective banning of apps.

"Trai seeks views on need to review norms for public, captive mobile radio trunking services",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-seeks-views-on-need-to-review-norms-for-public-captive-mobile-radio-trunking-services/articleshow/103180587.cms,29-08-2023,"The telecom regulator has called for views on the need for a review of the terms and conditions of the license norms for public and captive mobile radio trunking services (
PMRTS
and CMRTS), which are used to operate walkie-talkies.
In the discussion paper titled ‘Review of Terms and Conditions of PMRTS and CMRTS Licenses’, the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
Trai
) asked whether there is a need to review the terms and conditions of PMRTS License and PMRTS Authorization under Unified License and if PMRTS providers should be permitted internet connectivity on static internet protocol (IP) addresses.
The authority also sought comments on whether it is possible to deliver the PMRTS/ CMRTS, which are mission critical in nature, using
4G/5G network
slicing or any other technology.
“If yes, in what manner should the delivery of PMRTS/ CMRTS using 4G/ 5G network slicing be enabled in the license? What should be safeguards to ensure that the quality-of-service for cellular networks is not adversely impacted?” Trai sought to know in the paper released Tuesday.
The paper follows a June 2022 letter by the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) requesting recommendations on the terms and conditions for issue of fresh licenses for CMRTS and PMRTS Services especially with respect to technical conditions and financial aspects, the sector regulator said in a notification Tuesday.
Live Events
The deadline for written comments on the discussion paper is September 26, and for counter comments, it’s October 10.
The sector regulator observed that telecom technology has grown significantly over the past few years and asked if PMRTS providers should be made to keep pace.
“Whether there is a need to mandate PMRTS providers to migrate to spectrally efficient digital technologies in a time-bound manner,” Trai asked industry stakeholders to comment.
It asked for comments on Trai’s existing recommendations on the method allocation of spectrum to PMRTS providers. It also asked if an auction is the preferred method of spectrum allocation, then what should be the eligibility criteria for bidders, spectrum caps, and rollout obligations.
It further asked if the entire available spectrum in the frequency bands identified for PMRTS in National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP) should be put to auction.
It also asked stakeholders to share their views on the extant provisions relating to service area for PMRTS Authorization under Unified License and if it would be appropriate to grant the same for three different categories at national, telecom circle/metro area and secondary switching levels.
Mobile Radio Trunking Service
(MRTS) is a two-way mobile radio service in which users communicate amongst themselves in a designated group (often referred to as ‘talk group’), through a pair of radio frequencies which get assigned out of a common pool of frequencies in a designated frequency band.
In India, MRTS has found a growing prominence in all critical infrastructure sectors such as manufacturing, oil & gas, mining, construction, courier, emergency medical services, utilities, transportation (road, airports, harbours etc.), energy & communication, fire & safety department of public utilities.
“The subscriber base of PMRTS was 64,839 as on 30.06.2023. At present, eight licensed service providers are offering PMRTS services in 11 Licensed Service Areas (LSAs). As per the information provided by DoT, there are 117 CMRTS licensees in the country,” Trai said.

and
Vodafone Idea
(Vi) have called for auctions as the default mechanism for spectrum assignment for broadcast and telecom applications, a suggestion which was opposed by broadcast entities and peer telecom operators.
At an open house discussion hosted by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Wednesday,
Bharti Airtel
reiterated the need for regulation of content tariff across distribution platforms so that the same content is not priced radically different on different platforms.
The topic of the discussion was 'Regulating Converged Digital Technologies and Services - Enabling Convergence of Carriage of Broadcasting and Telecommunication'.
""Auction should be the default mechanism for assignment of spectrum whether it is for telecom or broadcasting so - satellite or terrestrial,"" a representative from Jio said during the three-hour-long discussion held virtually.
Jio said more spectrum should be made available for 5G, and that the service provider should be allowed to decide what to use acquired spectrum for, rather than the regulator pre-deciding which band can be used for what purpose. ""Majority of spectrum bands can be used interchangeably between separate satellite and terrestrial networks,"" the Jio representative said.

Vodafone Idea, in its comments, supported the view that all spectrum should be auctioned. The telco also proposed a common licensing ministry for ease of obtaining permissions in case of convergence. Representatives from broadcasters opposed auctioning of spectrum used for television broadcast, arguing that spectrum used in broadcast is of the space category which is available in abundance.
Industry body Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF), which represents Indian broadcasters, had previously submitted in its written comments to the sector regulator that spectrum management for telecom and broadcast should be kept separate since the two services serve different purposes.
Airtel also said that only terrestrial spectrum should be auctioned. It also stressed on the need to regulate content distribution in the same vein that it is regulated for linear TV. Under the rules set by Trai, distribution platforms cannot deny carriage to any broadcast content, and the pricing of content is also regulated. ""Today the same content is delivered over linear TV (DTH for example) and OTT streaming platforms and the rules and regulations governing the tariffs are different,"" an
Airtel
representative said. ""If this anomaly continues, we are risking exclusionary and discriminatory impact on subscribers.""

DoT gets ready for next round of 5G spectrum sale,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-gets-ready-for-next-round-of-5g-spectrum-sale/articleshow/102955656.cms,22-08-2023,"The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has set the ball rolling for the next round of
5G spectrum auction
, sending a reference to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) seeking reserve price for various bands which could be worth around ₹2.5 lakh crore.
All the unsold airwaves from last year's sale as well as some additional quantum in the 37 GHz band or millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum will be put up on sale, said officials.
""The DoT is planning to put airwaves ranging from 600 MHz to above 37 GHz on sale,"" an official told ET on condition of anonymity.
The DoT has excluded the 6 GHz from the upcoming sale. The telcos and tech industry have been engaged in a fight over the 6 GHz band, with the former batting for the bandwidth to be auctioned while tech companies want it allocated administratively for Wi-Fi. But the DoT so has yet to take a final call on the matter.
Trai will now study the reference from the DoT and come out with a consultation paper on the issue in the coming weeks.
Live Events
The auction, though, is unlikely to see much of a bidding intensity, with only two buyers,
Reliance Jio
and
Bharti Airtel
, effectively in the fray, since the third private player, Vodafone Idea (Vi), is struggling to survive amid cash flow turmoil.
But both Bharti Airtel and Vi have permits expiring in 2024 in some circles such as West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Odisha, which could see some fight. For example, in the 2022 sale, the winning price of UP (East) soared almost 80% over its base price as Bharti Airtel - whose permits expire in 2024 in India's most populous circle - fought with Jio to protect its business.
This is the first time that spectrum in the above 37 GHz bands, also known as mmWave band, will be put up for sale. While mid-band is considered ideal for 5G, mmWave spectrum is also good for rolling out 5G networks. Recently,
Reliance
Jio and Bharti Airtel announced 5G rollouts on mmWave spectrum (26 GHz) bought in last year's sale.
Since the price of GHz spectrum is much less than mid-band, it is ideal for telcos to utilise a combination of both bands to roll out networks. Around 88000 MHz spectrum of the mmWave is available in the country, said officials.
In the last auction, which concluded on August 1, 2022, the government netted a record ₹1,50,173 crore, with bids for 71% of the 72.098 GHz of airwaves put on the block.
The mid-band (3300 MHz) and mmWave band (26 GHz) airwaves were sold at the base prices of ₹317 crore per MHz and ₹6.9 crore per MHz, generating ₹80,590 crore and ₹14,709 crore respectively.
Jio spent the most by buying 5G airwaves worth ₹88,078 crore, followed by
Bharti Airtel
, at ₹43,084 crore. Vodafone Idea spent ₹18,799 crore while newcomer Adani Data Networks bought spectrum for ₹212 crore.

5G services
for the first time as it looks to improve consumer experience.
In a consultation paper on review of quality of service (QoS) standards for access services (wireless and wireline) and broadband (wireless and wireline) services, the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
Trai
) has proposed revising the benchmark of network downtime to a cell level in place of the current base station (BTS) level to have a granular view of network availability.
Similarly for broadband services, since the LTE (4G) and
5G networks
support low latency, the QoS benchmark for the latency parameter has been proposed to be less than 100 milliseconds (ms) from the present 250 ms which was prescribed in year 2012, or before the rollout of 4G networks in the country.
“Trai has been receiving a number of complaints from the subscribers regarding call drops and other network related issues especially after rollout of 5G services,” the regulator said in the paper, released Friday. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), in a February 14 letter to Trai, had also highlighted the need to have QoS regulations reviewed periodically to update the parameters and benchmarks.
The regulator said that on detailed analysis of quarterly QoS performance reports, it has noted that due to the long performance assessment period of a quarter over a licensed service area (LSA), there could be pockets or areas experiencing poor quality of service. But due to the averaging effect, service providers have been meeting the overall QoS benchmark at LSA level.

“Accordingly, to have a closer view of the status of QoS, the draft regulations propose monthly QoS performance reporting at state and UT level in addition to at LSA level,” Trai said.
While coming out with draft regulations, the regulator has sought comments from all stakeholders by September 20. After the consultation process, the regulator will notify the revised rules on service quality.
Further, to simplify the regulatory framework for QoS, Trai is proposed a single regulation dealing with QoS standards for all voice and data services, irrespective of their access medium i.e., for both wireline and wireless services. “Accordingly, the present three regulations are proposed to be merged into a single regulation,” Trai said.
The regulator said an analysis of consumer complaints received by the service providers has also shown an increasing trend which does not indicate improvement in QoS. The total number of consumer complaints registered by the service providers, including basic, broadband and cellular services, have increased to 65.96 million in 2022 from 48.42 million in 2019. Almost 70% of these complaints are related to faults and network issues, Trai said.
It added that it is critical to have a comprehensive approach to achieve the desired level of QoS to deliver expected quality of experience (QoE) by consumers. “Quality of telecom services should not be seen in isolation as it is a sum-total of the quality and provisioning of (a) underlying network resources (b) supporting infrastructure like power backup and backhaul (c) operation & management practices and (d) operation and management manpower,” Trai said.
Therefore, the authority said that it is of the opinion that service providers are required to adopt the ‘QoS-by-Design’ approach to achieve the level of services which is already supported by network technologies and expected by the consumers.

Changes to Right of Way rules to expedite 5G rollout: COAI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/coai-laws-changes-to-right-of-way-rules/articleshow/102833497.cms,19-08-2023,"Telecom industry has lauded the changes in right of way (
RoW
) rules allowing setting up of temporary overground telegraph infrastructure, clarity on street furniture and setting up of small cells etc.
The industry has termed the amended RoW rules as progressive and forward-looking, with a clear focus towards enhancing the 5G ecosystem and expansive digital connectivity for all citizens across India. It, however, feels that the real benefits of these measures would depend upon their effective implementation by local authorities in letter and spirit.
Cellular Operators Association of India (
COAI
), association of all the three private telecom operators –Reliance Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and
Vodafone Idea
–has said the amendments add to the many steps initiated by the government to facilitate ease of doing business in the sector and will support the industry in further enhancing and maintaining the networks in a much speedier manner.
These amendments are in continuation to the earlier amendments made in 2017, 2021 and 2022, for further facilitation of rolling out robust telecom infrastructure in the country.

“We welcome the move by DoT to introduce the new amended RoW rules…It will enable rapid network reinstatement in the event of underground telecom infrastructure damage, expedite 5G rollout by utilizing the state’s existing infrastructure, simplify application procedures for multiple small cell sites and allocate Central government areas for small cell deployment at no cost,” SP Kochhar, Director General, COAI said.
The latest amendment allows licensees to set up temporary overground telegraph infrastructure when their existing underground infrastructure is damaged, and no fees will be charged by the authorities for this temporary setup. This would help restore telegraph services on priority, thus preventing major disruptions in services to the users.
The amendment, COAI said, also adds the much-needed clarity in the regulations itself, on the definition of street furniture, which means post or pole used for electricity, streetlight, traffic light, traffic sign, bus stop, tram stop, taxi stand, public lavatory, memorial, public sculpture, utility pole or any other structure or contrivance of such nature established over the property of an appropriate authority, which will aid in faster rollouts and more efficient network deployments.
As per the revised rules, the appropriate authority shall make provisions allowing the licensee to submit a single application for multiple sites for establishment of small cells. Further, the appropriate central authorities are now allowed to deploy small cells on their buildings and structures without administrative fees, except for charges related to power and fixtures provided by building owners.

'Vodafone Idea's fundraise plans may be hit if govt takes over',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/vodafone-ideas-fundraise-plans-may-be-hit-if-govt-takes-over/articleshow/102812033.cms,17-08-2023,"The prospects of the government taking over 70% ownership of
Vodafone Idea
by converting principal statutory dues into equity could limit the cash-strapped telco's ability to attract much-needed equity funding from third-party investors, analysts said, posing fresh questions on its survival.
Vodafone Idea (Vi) faces more than ₹40,000 crore annual regulatory payouts once its four-year payment moratorium ends in the third quarter of 2025-26.
If the government exercises its option of converting principal into equity, Vi could end up with over 70% government ownership, brokerage
IIFL Securities
said in a note.
""We believe that significant external equity infusion may be unlikely considering the potential significant dilution once the moratorium is lifted,"" it said.
The government is already Vi's largest shareholder with a 33.1% stake after it converted the telco's accrued interest towards adjusted gross revenue (AGR) arrears into equity in February 2023. The telco's cofounders, UK's Vodafone Plc and India's Aditya Birla Group (ABG), jointly own 50.4% in Vi. Of this, Vodafone UK has a stake of 32.3%, while the Indian group has 18.1%.
Live Events
Significant equity infusion and increasing average revenue per user are crucial for the survival of country's third-largest telco that is continuously losing customers to bigger rivals
Reliance
Jio and
Bharti Airtel
.
""We believe a fundraise is critical to improve competitiveness as capex is needed to close coverage gaps in key states that can stall churn,"" said JP Morgan.
Vi's leadership expects the telco to close its much-delayed external equity-linked funding in the coming December quarter, saying talks have gained momentum in the last one month. The company has tied up funding commitments of ₹2,000 crore from one of its promoters, and is confident of raising more debt once the equity funding is in place.
For now, though, analysts warned that Vi could face serious funding shortfalls once the moratorium ends.
Brokerage Emkay Research said Vi needs a steeper tariff hike to pull through even if the government converts dues into equity post moratorium.
""The subsistence of Vi, post FY26, will become increasingly difficult as the company may face funding shortfall of ₹25,000 crore in FY26 and of ₹36,000 crore in FY27, which will require steep tariff hikes of 84% and 122%, respectively, for making payments,"" Emkay said.
It added that even further conversion of instalments into equity (₹17,400 crore per annum approx.) by the government post moratorium will offer little relief to Vi, as it will still face a funding shortfall of ₹13,000 crore in FY26 and ₹18,500 crore in FY27.
""In such an event, Vi will in any case require steep tariff hikes of 44%/63% by FY26/FY27... This will also result in cumulative dilution of 63% to 77% in five years (FY26-30) for Vi's shareholders,"" Emkay said.
Motilal Oswal said Vi's liquidity situation continues to appear bleak, given that there is a scheduled debt repayment of ₹7,000 crore in FY24. The telco's cash and cash equivalents stood at a modest ₹250 crore at June-end.
""Vi's current low Ebitda (₹4,157 crore in Q1FY24) will make it challenging to service debt without an external fund infusion...assuming 12x EV/EBITDA, with a net debt of ₹2.11 lakh-crore, it leaves limited opportunity for equity shareholders,"" Motilal Oswal said.
Goldman Sachs recently estimated that in the absence of meaningful tariff hikes in the near-term, Vi requires $8-10 billion of fresh capital over the next two years to have a comparable mobile broadband network to effectively compete with Airtel and Jio.
Shares of Vi slipped 1.02% to close at ₹7.74 on the BSE on Thursday.

DoT panel's 6 GHz spectrum proposals 'biased': Tech firms,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-panels-6-ghz-spectrum-proposals-biased-tech-firms/articleshow/102780959.cms,17-08-2023,"Technology firms have termed the recommendations of the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) committee on
6 GHz spectrum
as “biased” and said the panel itself was one-sided with it originally comprising only telecom industry associations — COAI and GSMA — with no representation from WiFi bodies.
In a letter to telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw dated August 4, the
Broadband India Forum
(BIF) — an association of tech players including
Amazon
,
Microsoft
,
Meta
and Google etc — said after much prodding, it was included as a member, but the tech industry was still in a minority as WiFi industry bodies WBA and Wi-Fi Alliance were denied entry.
While the entry of the WBA and Wi-Fi Alliance was denied because they were global stakeholders, London-based GSMA was allowed to be a part of it, the BIF said. In addition, the report of the committee talks about spectrum needs of only IMT (or 5G services) and does not mention the bandwidth needs of WiFi6E and WiFi7.
“The summarisation of the committee is completely biased. Para 5.3 of the committee report acknowledges the need for an additional 2 GHz of spectrum needs for IMT, based on some propaganda by GSMA. This is notwithstanding the fact that the committee did not have the mandate to discuss spectrum needs for IMT,” BIF president TV Ramachandran said in the letter.
According to the forum, the spectrum needs from new emerging use cases for WiFi were not given due consideration. “The committee refused to acknowledge that the WiFi community also had presented their spectrum needs requirement of an additional 1200 MHz spectrum in the 6 GHz band,” the letter said.

Earlier, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which has private telcos
Reliance
Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea as its members, had written to DoT, stressing that delicensing the 6 GHz band would lead to a loss to the exchequer as the spectrum has immense commercial potential as well as demand for IMT/mobile use. “Any delicensing of 6 GHz or part thereof will reduce the spectrum for 5G and thereby limit the growth of 5G and 6G, which would be the main drivers of broadband in the country,” it said in a letter to DoT.
At present, the 6 GHz band is partly used for the Indian Space Research Organisation’s satellite operations. The prize 6 GHz offers is huge. It can support Internet speeds of up to 10 Gbps, like 5G speeds, or up to 100 times faster than 4G.
The BIF and COAI letters escalate an ongoing slugfest between telcos and technology companies to corner the 6 GHz spectrum band. Telcos want this band auctioned and fully made available for 5G services now and 6G in future while tech companies want it delicensed to boost affordable broadband penetration across rural India via the WiFi route.
The tech industry feels that with the availability and benefits of superior and standardised WiFi technologies such as WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 in the 6 GHz band, many countries with much smaller requirements than India have delicensed the entire 6 GHz spectrum band for greater broadband proliferation.

The regulator said that the certification process would enable the standardisation of CAS and SMS deployed by DPOs, which would enable access to only subscribed television channels for subscribers.
Experts believe that the CAS and SMS testing and certification are expected to bring more transparency to the broadcasting value chain.
In the TV distribution value chain, CAS and SMS are crucial. CAS enables secure delivery of the TV channels to only the authorised subscribers, while SMS is responsible for the activation and deactivation of set-top boxes (STBs), managing subscriber information, channel information, and billing.
In 2021, Trai published regulations that set forth a framework for the technical compliance of CAS and SMS. Subsequently, the TEC was designated as the testing and certification agency for CAS and SMS used for broadcasting and cable TV services.
TEC has released the test guides and certification procedure and has also accredited two agencies—Salka
Global Technologies
and Altruist Technologies—for testing CAS and SMS.
Trai said that TEC is in the process of accrediting more testing labs to carry out such testing.

It, though, has called on the government to make necessary provisions to ensure such digital connectivity infrastructure provider (DCIP) permit-holders can buy radio equipment, but without any assignment of spectrum.
The sector regulator has also suggested that the proposed DCIP permit must not attract any licence fee. Instead, it has recommended an entry fee of Rs 2 lakh and an application processing fee of Rs 15,000.
“National Digital Communications Policy–2018 has
put
much emphasis on digital infrastructure and services increasingly emerging as key enablers and critical determinants of a country’s growth and well-being, and it’s imperative that new players are encouraged and promoted through conducive a licensing framework for creation of active and passive infrastructure over which any digital service can ride,” the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) said in its 70-page set of recommendations issued Tuesday.
It believes the presence of neutral third-party entities, capable of creating passive as well as some network layer active infrastructure can help in increased sharing, bring down overall infrastructure costs and strengthen services delivery.

The regulator added that since 5G requires massive additions of above and below ground infrastructure in the passive and active categories, there will be a need to create common sharable digital infrastructure, particularly in densely populated urban areas to deliver strong coverage.
Active telecom infrastructure, typically, comprises network electronics such as antennae, feeder cables, transmission systems while mobile towers represent passive telecom infrastructure.
Trai has also suggested that the DCIP permit not be a standalone one but an authorisation within the ambit of a unified licence. It has also recommended that a separate light-touch licence authorisation (under UL) be created for DCIPs.
Among other key recommendations, it has suggested that DCIP licence-holders not be mandated to furnish performance
bank
guarantees (PBGs). Further, it has urged the government to make an amendment in the unified licence to ensure that whenever a UL licensee (read: hirer of service) uses the services of a DCIP permit-holder, their commercial pacts should have stringent terms obligating the DCIPs to ensure license conditions applicable to the `hirer’ around operations and network security are not breached.
Trai said that globally, countries are establishing best practices for formulating regulations and administrative processes in the context of digital connectivity infrastructure development. For instance, in the
European Commission
, it said, a broadband network has been split into three layers -- passive infrastructure, active equipment technology and delivery of services – which depend on each other.
The regulator has also suggested a clause that bars DCIPs from entering into legally binding contractual pacts conferring `indefeasible right of use’ (IRU) of its
DCI
resources to specific eligible entity/entities only as that might lead to exclusion of others.

Jio and Vodafone Idea who were pushing for those airwaves to be auctioned.
The bill itself is believed to have been cleared by the
Cabinet
on Friday, but it’s not clear when it will be tabled in Parliament. The draft bill was issued in September last year and put up for public consultation.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) appears to have had a rethink on regulating communication apps, and now believe the existing definition under the Indian Telegraph Act is good enough and there is no need to specifically put OTT in the new bill.
As per the Telegraph Act, a ""telegraph"" means any appliance, instrument, material or apparatus used or capable of use for transmission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, visual or other electro-magnetic emissions, radio waves or Hertzian waves, galvanic, electric or magnetic means.

Officials said that the current definition covers all kinds of communications happening over a telecom network. “The government is already empowered to regulate the OTT apps as per the Telegraph Act, but it is not exercising its powers. Currently, the intent is not to regulate but if need arises, it can be looked into in future,” said an official on condition of anonymity.
The information and broadcasting ministry had raised concerns on inclusion of broadcasting services as part of telecommunication services in the original draft bill.
Industry bodies such as
Broadband India Forum
(BIF) and Internet and Mobile Association of India too had demanded that content and broadcasting be kept outside the purview of the telecom bill.
On the issue of satellite spectrum, officials said that the wider mandate among the government favoured administrative allocation. However, the DoT will undertake a process of defining the rules and regulations around allotment after meeting the industry and other stakeholders.
The new telecom bill – when it is passed by Parliament – seeks to replace three laws: the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933 and the Telegraph Wires (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1950.
Further, the government has also sorted out issues around possible dilution of the
Telecom Regulatory Authority
of India’s (Trai’s) powers and potential domain overlap with the broadcasting ministry.
Trai is also undertaking a consultation process around regulating OTT communication apps. The recommendations of the regulator will be looked into by the government, officials added.

Trai issues supplementary paper on data communication services involving airlines,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-issues-supplementary-paper-on-data-communication-services-involving-airlines/articleshow/102399876.cms,03-08-2023,"The telecom regulator has issued a supplementary consultation paper on
data communication services
provided by entities other than the Airports Authority of India (AAI) as issues around service license and methodology of spectrum allocation such as auction etc remained untouched in the previous process.
On December 12 last year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) had issued a consultation paper on the matter, asking for suggestions regarding the mechanism of providing spectrum to IT and communication vendors to the Indian aviation industry – Société Internationale de Telecommunications Aeronautiques, (SITA) and Bird Consultancy Services (BCS).
Replying to the paper, all three private mobile operators had said that such spectrum should be brought under the licensing regime. While
Reliance
Jio and
Vodafone Idea
wanted the allocation to be done through an auction,
Bharti Airtel
proposed continuation of the current mechanism of assignment through an administrative basis – or on payment of a fee.
However, Trai has observed that specific inputs have not been received on some of the aspects related to service license for provision of data communication services between aircraft and ground stations, methodology for spectrum assignment, and spectrum charging mechanism.
The authority feels that inputs on these issues will be necessary for a comprehensive analysis of the matter and formulating the recommendations. “Accordingly, the Authority has decided to issue this supplementary consultation paper to seek inputs from stakeholders on such aspects,” the regulator said in a statement Thursday.

In the supplementary consultation paper, Trai wants to know if the data communication services between aircraft and ground stations provided by organizations other than AAI are brought under service licensing regime, what should be the eligibility conditions for obtaining service licence.
Further, in case of auction for spectrum allocation it wanted to know about the eligibility conditions to participate, whether the entire available spectrum in 117.975 - 137 MHz band at each airport/ ground station should be put to auction and what should be the block size. It also wants comments on what should be spectrum cap for each airport, rollout obligations, payment terms etc.
SITA and BCS are the only two companies providing data communication services for aircraft to ground station contact. Voice services for the same are provided by the AAI.
So far, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been assigning frequencies - 131.725 MHz and 136.975 MHz to SITA and 131.825 MHz to BCS – on an administrative basis. However, the DoT, on realising that the frequencies were not used solely for captive purposes, wrote to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in 2014, seeking clarification on permissions granted for the same.
The vendors provide data communication services to all
airlines
to help obtain information from aircrafts such as passenger information, and aircraft engine parameters, through Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting system (ACAR).

ease of doing business
, the
Department of Telecommunications
(
DoT
) has allowed telecom firms to shift or re-deploy their wireless equipment from one service area to another, just by giving an intimation to its wireless planning and coordination (WPC) wing and a formal approval would not be required.
The DoT Wednesday said in a notification that telecom operators can inform the WPC wing online through the
Saral
sanchar portal.
The department added that till the time an online facility is made available, telecom operators can submit the details of shifting through email. The telcos, however, have to give an undertaking that such details will be updated subsequently, as and when online facility is made available by the DoT, the notification said.
“Necessary stock/ records arising out of such transfer shall be required to be maintained/reflected wherever applicable,” the DoT said.
The DoT has been taking various measures to promote ease of doing business. The government has taken various initiatives with regards to ease the burden of regulatory compliances and digitising various records. Saral sanchar has been the portal for getting various approvals related to the telecom sector.

No satellite gateways in urban areas to 'protect' telecom networks: DoT,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/no-satellite-gateways-in-urban-areas-to-protect-telecom-networks-dot/articleshow/102115912.cms,26-07-2023,"New Delhi: The
Department of Telecommunications
(
DoT
) has decided not to allow
satellite
earth station gateways in urban areas, citing interference with mobile networks.
While the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) had recommended that satellite gateways could be set up anywhere within the territorial limits of India, the DoT has rejected that view and decided to incorporate additional provisions related to urban areas in order to preserve the precious terrestrial spectrum used for mobile services.
DoT officials told ET that due to dense mobile networks in urban areas, there would be interference as the beam of satellite and terrestrial signal fell on the same area. That aside, the DoT has accepted all of Trai's recommendations on the matter, they said.
In its recommendations, Trai had said the service area for the satellite earth station gateway (SESG) should be at a national level. But the DoT has decided that new SESG will not be allowed to be established in urban areas. It has also mandated that the keep-off distance for frequency band 25.5 GHz-31 GHz should be 750 metres from the urban area boundary or municipal limits. Further, the DoT believes the SESG may also serve a regional network covering a few states.

""The recommendations of Trai have been accepted in principle. The DoT has added some provisions wherever required, like for setting up gateways,"" an official said on condition of anonymity.
In certain use cases, though, the DoT has said, exemption can be given regarding setting up gateways in urban areas on a case-to-case basis, considering a combination of factors such as transmit power, location and its possible impact on terrestrial operations. The clearance for such cases, the official said, should come from the inter-ministerial committee for satellite network. which includes members from the Indian Space Research Organisation, Telecommunication Engineering Centre, Wireless Planning and Coordination, Network Operations and Control Centre and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
The exempted use cases or applications could include satellite telemetry, tracking and command operations, gateways for thin data services such as IoT and M2M, the official said.
An inter-ministerial panel, the Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the DoT’s highest decision-making body, last week approved Trai’s recommendations on SESG and the additional provisions proposed by the DoT.
As per the proposals, the SESG licence holders should not offer any kind of telecom or broadcasting services to consumers directly. Such entities should offer their services to only licensed firms like telecom operators.
The regulator had also recommended that no spectrum be assigned to SESG holders as they won’t be providing communication services to end-consumers.
The SESG licence should be valid for a period of 20 years from the effective date of the licence, with a provision of renewal for 10 years.
There was a need for a new framework for SESG as the existing regime did not allow such players. The current regime mandates that a licensee should establish its own gateway for providing any kind of satellite-based communication services.

OTT
) platforms, especially communication apps such as
WhatsApp
, Facebook and
Telegram
, in case a need arises, to ensure continuity of essential internet-driven services such as financial transactions, e-healthcare and online education.
""Currently, the authorities are not able to selectively ban WhatsApp, Telegram and others. They are banning the entire internet. The intent now is to continue essential services such as banking, healthcare and online educational services,"" a senior Trai official told ET on condition of anonymity. ""It is not as if OTTs are targeted by bringing in such a regulatory framework.""
Another official said sometimes false messages are exchanged, including in bulk, on communication platforms which can sometimes lead to social unrest and violence. So, the authority has to consider matters of national security while examining the feasibility and mechanism to be followed while dealing with critical situations.
Earlier this month, the sector watchdog released a consultation paper, seeking to explore a framework for selective banning of apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram in a geographical area during emergency situations, instead of a blanket internet ban.

The paper, which also sought views about technical solutions to mitigate the challenges that can come with the selective banning of apps, followed a reference from the Department of Telecommunications, after a suggestion by the parliamentary standing committee on information and technology. The parliamentary panel had suggested that a policy on selective banning of mobile apps could be formulated.
The suggestion, though, has been strongly opposed by lobby groups representing OTT companies, such as the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) and the Internet and Mobile Association of India.
OTT providers argue that they are already regulated under the IT Act 2000, which was amended in 2008, and that additional laws would only hinder innovation. Some have called the proposal on the selective banning ""draconian"" and ""anti-consumer"".

DoT to decide soon on Trai's proposals to set up satellite earth station gateways,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/dot-to-decide-soon-on-trais-proposals-to-set-up-satellite-earth-station-gateways/articleshow/101728681.cms,13-07-2023,"New Delhi: The Department of Telecommunications (
DoT
) is expected to take a decision next week on the recommendations given by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) for setting up
satellite earth station gateways
.
As per officials, the inter-ministerial panel, Digital Communications Commission (DCC), is scheduled to meet next week and take a call on the matter. The regulator in November last year had proposed a separate pan-India license for setting up
satellite earth station
gateways (
SESG
), which should be outside the ambit of unified license.
As per the Trai proposals, the SESG license holders should pay a token Re 1 license fee as they won’t be offering any kind of telecom or broadcasting services to consumers directly. Such entities should offer their services to only licensed firms like telecom operators. The regulator has also recommended that no spectrum should be assigned to SESG holders as they won’t be providing communication services to end-consumers.
The DoT in September 2021 had sought recommendations from Trai on licensing framework for the operation of satellite earth station gateways.
The current regime mandates that a licensee should establish its own gateway for providing any kind of satellite-based communication services. But with the advancement of satellite technologies, new generation satellite like low earth orbit and medium earth orbit (LEO/MEO) getting operational, the current regime won’t be suitable.
Live Events
The LEO and MEO satellites operate through narrow beams as against a single wide beam of conventional satellites. For the new age satellite, there would be a requirement for setting up multiple gateways to control the large number of beams.
“The current licensing conditions may pose a limitation to establish its own gateway for rendering satellite services, thereby resulting in higher capex and opex,” DoT had told Trai. Given the circumstances, DoT felt the need to explore the possibility of a licensing framework for establishing gateway as an independent facility, set up either by a satellite constellation operator or any other entity.
As satcom services are going to become more prevalent in the coming future, the government is framing regulatory policies for the sector.
Bharti Group-backed OneWeb,
Reliance
Jio’s JV with Luxembourg-based SES, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, Elon Musk-owned Starlink, Viasat, and the Tata-Telesat combine are among those readying to enter India’s relatively nascent fast broadband-from-space services segment. As per EY-ISpA report, India's space economy is set to rise to $13 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 6%.
The Trai is also holding a consultation on the key aspect of spectrum allocation for satellite communication. While satcom firms such as Starlink, OneWeb and Amazon want spectrum to be allotted without auctions but are pitted against telcos Jio and Vodafone Idea who want it to be allotted to the highest bidder. Telco peer
Bharti Airtel
though doesn’t want auctions, but its reasons are different from satcom companies.

These frameworks aim to promote regulators' desire for innovation with economic resilience and consumer protection. It is in this backdrop, that the telecom department asked TRAI to provide recommendations on the framework for the regulatory sandbox.
""The authority approaches the issue with the aim to promote creativity and accelerate the uptake of cutting-edge technologies in the field of digital communications,"" TRAI said.
Emerging technologies like
Artificial Intelligence
, the Internet of Things, edge computing, and others are transforming and revolutionising the way in which people connect, interact, and access information.
According to TRAI, there is a need for providing an enabling environment for the development and deployment of novel technologies, services, use cases, and business models to stay up with this dynamic environment.
The regulatory sandbox strategy has gained traction throughout the world as a way to encourage innovation across various industries.
A regulatory sandbox provides a regulated setting where companies and innovators can test their concepts, goods, and services while operating under fluid regulations.
""Regulatory Sandbox will help the startup ecosystem in the telecom industry by giving them access to the real-time network environment and other data so that they may test the reliability of new applications before releasing them on the market,"" TRAI said.
To provide the starting company with a single window for obtaining all clearances, the regulatory sandbox also seeks to encourage cross-sectoral collaboration for carrying out such tests by enlisting the help of other ministries and departments.
The consultation paper discusses some of the regulatory sandbox frameworks that are working in the digital communication sector globally and also details some of the frameworks working within the country in other sectors.
The last date for written comments on the draft sandbox framework is July 17, 2023, and for counter comments August 1, 2023.

Telecom companies want more gear under 'trusted source' to keep China out,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/telecom-companies-want-more-gear-under-trusted-source-to-keep-china-out/articleshow/101171489.cms,22-06-2023,"Telecom industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) wants the ‘trusted source’ approval mandate to be applied to all network elements including connected devices, to ensure a uniform level of security.
Currently, equipment used for non-licensed telecom services does not need to follow the trusted source mandate. But in today’s connected world, any malware or virus in any of the connected devices, which could be a wireless router, sensor or any smart device, can potentially harm the entire telecom network infrastructure of the country, say telecom industry executives.
“A network is as strong as its weakest link and all connected devices are a potential attack vector if not secured,” COAI director-general SP Kochhar told ET. The association represents all private telcos:
Reliance
Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea.
The telecom industry wants equipment like
routers
,
switches
,
sensors
and
smart meters
used in unlicensed communication and services like wifi also be included under the trusted source mandate.
The industry body had earlier also written to the Department of Telecommunications, seeking to enlarge the mandate of trusted source.

To be selected by telecom operators in India, equipment suppliers must get approval as a ‘trusted’ source from the National Security Council Secretariat. The security clearance is part of a directive that came into effect June 15, 2021, under which operators can procure equipment only from trusted sources.
However, no such approval is required if the equipment is used for non-licensed telecom services.
The trusted source mandate was put in place by the government to keep a check from Chinese telecom vendors like Huawei and ZTE. It was aimed at safeguarding the telecom networks after heightened tensions between India and China. Both Chinese vendors have been effectively kept out of 5G rollouts in the country, without banning them outright. While the telecom networks have been secured, equipment from China is currently being used for wifi services, etc.
Meanwhile, the industry association reiterated its demand that 6 GHz spectrum be allocated to telecom operators for 5G services. As per the COAI, 6 GHz provides a balance of wide coverage and capacity, which is critical to rapid and cost-efficient deployments of 5G mobile networks.
“6 GHz is the only-mid band spectrum range where a contiguous bandwidth of the order of 300-400 MHz per telecom operator is possible to make it available for evolving demands towards 2030,” the association said during a presentation to the media Wednesday.
The telecom industry is opposing demands by some technology firms to delicense the 6 GHz band for wifi services. As per COAI, top speed of wifi will remain the same, both in 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands, so there is no value addition. “Currently, the ecosystem does not support the implementation of wifi 6E anytime soon. By the time India develops a compatible ecosystem for wifi 6E, 5G would have attained higher features,” the association said.

Trai seeks views on regulatory sandbox framework to boost telecom tech innovation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-seeks-views-on-regulatory-sandbox-framework-to-boost-telecom-tech-innovation/articleshow/101114669.cms,19-06-2023,"The telecoms regulator has sought suggestions for creating a holistic framework to drive cutting-edge tech innovation in the digital communications space via transparent and safe live testing environments, popularly known as regulatory sandboxes.
In a 48-page discussion paper, issued Monday, the regulator has invited
stakeholder
views on the ideal eligibility criteria for companies to participate in such a sandboxing framework and on ways to encourage participation of startups and small & medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the mega digital tech innovations endeavour. It has also sought suggestions on ways to protect consumer interests in a sandboxing environment, especially from potential data breaches,
fraud
and other
security
risks.
The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) had received a reference from the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) in March 2023 to offer recommendations around creating a regulatory sandbox framework that can be used to encourage innovative technologies, services, use cases and
business
models.
Last year, India's
Draft Telecommunications Bill
, 2022, had proposed a regulatory sandbox for driving tech innovation. The related provisions of the Bill had dealt with allowing companies/startups to use the sandbox to develop and test new technologies and facilitate innovation under a flexible framework.
“The regulatory sandbox (RS) refers to live testing of new products, services, applications in a controlled environment, where regulators/licensors may (or may not) permit certain regulatory/licensing relaxations for the limited purpose of the testing,” Trai said in its discussion paper issued Monday.

The objectives of the sandbox framework, it said, are to spur innovation, protect consumer interests, mitigate risks associated with new tech and business models and also reduce the regulatory burden for SMEs.
“Entities shall be granted certain facilities and flexibility to experiment with telecom products/services/applications in a live environment and on a limited set of real customers for a limited time-frame…these features shall be fortified with safeguards for customer protection and
risk
mitigation.”
Trai has also called for inter-sectoral collaborations to boost tech innovation under the sandbox framework, especially since many 5G/6G use cases would require close coordination with regulators and other stakeholders like municipalities, power
distribution
companies, state and central ministries, airports, ports, metro trains, and smart city authorities amongst others.
It added that the sandbox model can offer a structured avenue to the licensor/regulator to engage with the ecosystem and help them develop an innovation-responsive framework that enables delivery of relevant, low-cost (tech) products.
Trai has invited comments and counter-comments on the discussion paper by July 17 and August 1 respectively.
According to the regulator, designing a sandboxing framework that encourages participation of startups/SMEs is crucial to promote innovation, and some possible enablers could include a simplified applications process, lighter regulatory compliance drill, easier access to resources, as in mentorship and funding to help them develop/test products and services through the sandboxing framework.
On the proposed eligibility criteria, Trai has suggested that any licensed service provider, called a principal applicant, should be eligible for testing in the regulatory sandbox subject to fulfillment of conditions. Other entities, called applicants, who are willing to use sandboxing facilities of licensed service providers must engage with them, it added.
Trai’s discussion paper has also called for well defined governance and oversight mechanisms for the proposed sandbox framework. It has underlined a case for strong monitoring mechanisms, including a well-defined evaluation process as well as rules for companies to exit the sandboxing framework and transit to full regulatory compliance.
Testing new ideas in the digital communications sector, it said, can be very different from tests conducted in other fields as digital communication products/services are often used in complex real-world conditions, which can be difficult to simulate accurately. “Factors such as varying network conditions, different user profiles and diverse use cases make it challenging to test these products and services comprehensively.”
The regulator said that since digital communication is a strategic sector and tightly regulated, its products and services must comply with various rules and regulations before they can be launched commercially. It added that since the sector is very capital-intensive, with high costs involved in developing and deploying new technologies and services, any failure to commercialise the service, post-testing due to regulatory hurdles, can cause significant financial losses for the companies involved.

Biparjoy: War room to ensure tele network not hit by cyclone,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/biparjoy-war-room-to-ensure-tele-network-not-hit-by-cyclone/articleshow/101001180.cms,15-06-2023,"The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) has set up a war room at its headquarters here to ensure
cyclone Biparjoy
that is likely to make landfall in Gujarat on Thursday does not disrupt
telecom connectivity
or to keep the impact minimal.
DoT will get regular updates twice a day about how many sites have been affected and what contingent measures have been taken by
telcos
, officials said.
The telecom operators, on their part, have commenced intra-circle roaming arrangements in the affected areas so as to allow subscribers to make calls and send messages utilising the network of any of the telecom firms, in line with guidelines notified by DoT. Besides sharing infrastructure, telcos will be sending alerts to consumers on a regular basis.
As per the guidelines, telco should open a sufficient number of public calling booths, preferably free of cost, for the general public in affected areas. They should also ensure that in the disaster affected areas, no subscriber shall be denied access to voice/SMS communication due to any commercial consideration, whatsoever, including non-payment/insufficient balance/recharge, etc. and this facility shall continue for at least 15 days.
The rules also mandate telcos to keep, as inventory, certain minimum number of portable base stations and satellite equipment for connectivity to restore mobile services disrupted due to damaged base tower stations.

on Thursday said all principal entities, like banks, financial institutions, and others, need to complete the process of verification of message headers and content templates immediately, as the telecom regulator forged ahead with its drive to crackdown on pesky messages to safeguard consumers. Any delay on part of Principal Entities (PEs) to get the reverification of headers and content templates may result in the blocking of their headers, content templates and messages, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) cautioned.
TRAI said it will review the progress in the next two weeks and may issue suitable directions, if required.
""Therefore, all the PEs should complete the process of verification of Headers and Content Templates immediately,"" TRAI said in a statement.
Entities such as banks, other financial institutions, insurance companies, trading companies, business entities etc. send commercial messages to the telecom subscribers through SMS, and these entities are referred to as Principal Entities (PEs) in TRAI regulations.
As per the regulatory framework, any commercial communication can only take place using registered Headers assigned to the PEs for this purpose. Header refers to an alphanumeric string assigned to PEs under the regulations to send commercial communications.

These commercial entities are required to get content templates registered with the access providers (telcos). Any commercial communication through SMS is subjected to scrubbing against the content template registered by PEs with Access Provider and, if it fails, then those SMSs are not allowed to be delivered to the consumers.
TRAI has observed that some PEs have registered a large number of Headers and Content Templates and, at times, some of these are misused by some telemarketers.
To stop the same, TRAI on February 16, 2023, directed for reverification of all registered Headers and Content Templates on DLT (Distributed ledger technology) platform and block all unverified Headers and Message Templates within 30 and 60 days respectively.
In February 2023, TRAI wrote to
RBI
,
SEBI
,
NHA
and all Central/State Government Departments requesting them to sensitise various institutions and departments, under their ambit, who send bulk SMS, about the action required to be taken at their end to ensure that header and message templates are not misused.
""It has been seen that many PEs have not yet completed the verification of Headers and Content Templates. Due to lack of timely action by PEs, Headers and Content Templates assigned to such PEs remain vulnerable for likely misuse and may result in inconvenience to the public in the form of spam and also financial frauds,"" TRAI said.

"Tech companies hit back at telcos, say operators should compensate apps instead",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/tech-companies-hit-back-at-telcos-say-operators-should-compensate-apps-instead/articleshow/100180805.cms,12-05-2023,"Big
tech companies
and
telcos
are yet again at loggerheads on whether over-the-top (OTT) mobile applications – who generate maximum data internet traffic on telecom networks -- must be asked to pay for 5G network rollout costs in India.
The Broadband India Forum (
BIF
), which counts tech biggies such as
Meta
,
Google
, Amazon,
Microsoft
and Intel amongst its key members, has dialled telecom secretary K Rajaraman, saying such a move would be unfair as the OTTs were not involved at the stage of
spectrum auctions
, selection of bands, bidding for airwaves or in the selection of network infrastructure gear.
“..OTTs had no role while planning the network infrastructure…so, to expect them to post facto pay for the infrastructure which is designed, owned, deployed and controlled/managed by telcos is seemingly unfair,” BIF president T.V. Ramachandran said in a letter, dated May 11, to Rajaraman.
BIF’s letter comes even as India’s top telcos are set to urge the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) to develop a mechanism that compels OTT streaming / communication service providers – who benefit the most from using telecom networks -- to make a contribution towards 5G infrastructure investments, based on a fair share principle.
The telcos, in their upcoming letters to DoT and Trai, will also cite the ongoing global consultations on this subject initiated by the European Commission (EC) and Brazil’s telecoms regulator, Anatel. The EC is the executive arm of the European Union.

Telcos to push DoT, Trai to make OTTs share cost of 5G network infra
However, the BIF, in its latest letter to Rajaraman, has cited the October 2022 observations of European telecoms regulator group, BEREC (Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications) that any direct compensation from large content & application providers (CAPs) could endanger the principle of net neutrality and lead to a competitive distortion putting smaller and medium-sized ISPs at a disadvantage.
Last October, BEREC had also claimed that there was no evidence that operators’ network costs are not already fully covered and paid for in the internet value chain, from CAPs at one end, to the end users at the other.
The BIF has added that since OTTs generate more than 70% of the traffic for telcos, the latter should, on the contrary, share revenue with them. “Telcos owe their infrastructure utilisation to OTTs and should be grateful to them; so it’s logical for them to pay revenue share to OTTs,” the BIF said in its letter to Rajaraman.
The BIF has also countered telcos’ claims of OTTs being the biggest users of telecom networks, contending that it’s not the apps that are pushing traffic inside telco networks but the operators’ customers who are generating this additional traffic as they like using these apps. “Telcos are already charging them (their customers) the applicable data charges for this additional traffic..and since data tariffs are under forbearance, telcos are free to levy appropriate charges for data consumed.”

Telcos, though, are far from convinced. They assert that there is a major global debate underway around fair share, and accordingly, will push the DoT and Trai to take cognizance of the consultations now underway in Europe and Brazil, and similarly explore ways to create a fair share mechanism with the biggest traffic originators to ensure continued investments in next-gen 5G connectivity infrastructure in India. This is since it’s becoming a huge financial struggle for the telcos to shoulder this burden alone.

The telcos are set to draw the government and the sector regulator’s attention to the raging debate underway in the European Union (EU) and Brazil on the need for OTT streaming/communication service providers – who benefit the most from use of telecom networks -- to make a fair contribution for building mobile broadband connectivity infrastructure worth billions of dollars, amid rising costs.
India’s telecom companies will point to the ongoing global consultations initiated by the European Commission (EC) and Brazil’s telecoms regulator, Anatel, and also underline the need for OTTs generating maximum traffic on Indian telecom networks to make a contribution to the required infrastructure investments, based on a fair share principle. More so, since the rollout of 5G networks is slated to drive exponential growth in data traffic and entail even heavier investments in connectivity infrastructure in future.
“Worldwide, there is a big debate going on around fair share, and we hope DoT and Trai will take cognizance of the consultations now underway in Europe and Brazil, and similarly explore ways to create a fair share mechanism with the biggest traffic originators to ensure continued investments in next-gen connectivity infrastructure in India, especially as it’s becoming a huge financial struggle for the telcos to shoulder this burden alone,” a senior executive at one of India’s biggest telcos told ET.
A top executive of another leading telco said all operators in India “were aligned” on the matter, and would be writing to the government and the regulator shortly.

“Electronic communications operators, notably the incumbents, call for the need to establish rules to oblige content & application providers or `digital players’, who generate enormous volumes of traffic, to contribute to the electronic communications network deployment costs,” said the European Commission (EC) its consultation paper, titled `the future of the electronic communications sector and its infrastructure’. The EC is the executive arm of the EU, and the comments deadline on its discussion paper is May 19, 2023.
The EC paper has added that incumbent telcos in Europe believe such contribution would be fair as these digital players would, otherwise, take advantage of high-quality networks without bearing the cost of their rollout.
Brazil’s Anatel too is in the midst of a holistic consultation to address the future regulation of digital platforms and the need for fair share, with June 30, 2023, being the stakeholder comments deadline. Anatel’s paper discusses the pros and cons of implementing a regulation that establishes a remuneration for use of telecom networks.
It also poses questions on impact of new business models and players on the digital ecosystem of telecom networks. Anatel’s consultation also seeks to unravel any evidence that telco networks are struggling to process consumers’ data demand.
Back in 2016, the South Korean government had introduced a `sending party network pays’ model that mandated the sending party – as in the OTT streaming or communication service provider – to pay for internet traffic.
Simply put, the SPNP model assumes that it should always be the sending party network —in this case, the apps — who pays for the IP (internet protocol) packet delivery across the interconnect link between two service providers.
Last November, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) – which represents
Reliance
Jio,
Bharti Airtel
and Vodafone Idea – had said that OTT apps must compensate carriers for rolling out networks as they were the ones that used telco network infrastructure the most. The telecom industry association, in fact, had called on DoT to bring OTTs under a light-touch licensing regime and also clearly define communication services to remove all ambiguity.
But big tech players had strongly countered COAI and asserted that OTTs can’t be brought under the purview of telecommunications. The Broadband India Forum (BIF), which counts tech biggies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel and
TCS
amongst others as its members, had then said that bringing such players under the ambit of the telecommunication service licence implies that the government alone holds the exclusive privileges to decide, build, develop and operate the OTT apps.
“Such a situation is grossly anomalous, highly impractical and will lead to a collapse of the entire app ecosystem and thereby impacting innovation and growth of the economy,” the BIF had said.
Another tech players’ body, Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), had also then demanded that content and broadcasting be kept outside the purview of telecom.
Separately, the BIF had added that if telcos wanted OTTs to pay for network infrastructure, they too must pay OTTs for using the latter’s infrastructure. “The infrastructure for any communication network also includes data centres, under sea cables, content hosting centres, content delivery networks — all of which are built by OTT platforms. If the concept of paying network access charges is to be accepted, the telcos should also pay OTTs for all the above,” BIF had said.
Earlier in February, the IAMAI had also contended that the sending party network pays (SPNP) model would allow telcos to exploit internet businesses by formalising rent seeking.

Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
A bench led by Justice Sanjiv Khanna, while hearing the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) appeal, told additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee that the
DoT
should file ""an affidavit stating on oath"" that Bharti Airtel in terms of the sectoral tribunal's order ""would be liable to pay lower/lesser SUCs in comparison with the new players who were allotted spectrum under the 2016 telecom policy/auction"".
It also asked the DoT to give a chart indicating the revenue difference between the 2010 and 2016 auctions.
The DoT had challenged the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal's December 21, 2021 ruling that quashed a clause in its August 2016 office order related to SUCs for different spectrum bands.
Both Bharti Airtel and Bharti Hexacom had moved the tribunal against the 2016 clause alleging that the DoT had acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in excluding the spectrum in 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands acquired or allocated prior to 2015-2016 for determining the floor amount of
SUC
to be paid by the operators.

Mumbai-based TCS, a part of
Tata group
, will supply 4G equipment for 100,000 sites for a total sum of close to Rs 24500 crore that includes network gear for about Rs 13,000 crores, as well as third-party items and a 10-year annual maintenance contract (AMC).
Last month, telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that BSNL already started deploying 200 towers based on India's telecom stack, as a part of field trials.
Further Vaishnaw said that around August, a rapid rollout of next-generation-based telecom sites has already been planned, and added that the ongoing live testing is based on real customers in a physical environment.
“The 4G equipment deployed by BSNL will be quickly enhanced to 5G, requiring a software upgrade,” the minister earlier said.
In November last year, Mumbai-based TCS and state-run ITI Limited submitted their bids to deploy the BSNL’s next-generation network across four zones countrywide, following the proof of concept (PoC).
ITI has a 20% reservation in network procurement, although the company proposed to use equipment supplied by the TCS-led consortium that includes core network gear from the government-owned Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DoT).
The Tata Group company had proposed to supply core equipment within a year of receiving the purchase order (PO) while the supply of radio equipment is expected to be completed over a period of 18-24 months.
Last year, the indigenous telecom stack setup for BSNL 4G network was tested for 10 million simultaneous phone calls.
The state-controlled telco expects a 20% growth in revenues following the mass availability of 4G-led data services.

The grant of infrastructure status has been a long pending demand of the broadcasting sector.
The authority also recommended that the MIB should specify stage-wise timelines for the process of grant of each licence, registration, and permission in a similar manner as has been done for uplinking and downlinking permission for TV channels.
The ministry should prescribe timelines for additional permissions required during the lifecycle of the licence and the timelines should be incorporated in the respective guidelines as well as the citizen charter/broadcast seva portal, it said.

The authority reiterated that the government should establish a Centre of Excellence or align with a Centre of Excellence established by other ministries/departments to study technical, economic, social, and legal aspects of broadcasting services.
On issues related to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) clearance, Trai said the MIB should issue explicit guidelines, and the process of security clearance of an applicant company, and its key personnel should be made end-to-end online.
The regulator said the MIB may prescribe a standard undertaking to be submitted by each service provider on an annual basis to ensure compliance.
""Such undertaking should certify that either no change in management/ownership control has happened during the year or that the changes in the management/ownership structure have been submitted and requisite permission has been duly received (as applicable),"" it said.
Trai suggested that the online portal should provide an option to broadcasters or teleport operators to make payment of the annual permission fee either for one year or more than one year.
Refund of the annual fee paid in advance by the broadcaster must not be permitted in any case, it said.
The authority stated that the Wireless Planning and Coordination (WPC) wing of the Department of Telecom (DoT) should charge the spectrum royalty fee for temporary uplinking of live events on a pro-rata basis for the actual number of days of the event on the basis of per day charges instead of charging for the entire month. It asked the MIB to take up the matter with WPC.

The telecom watchdog plans to come out with a strategy for a pilot program in about a month's time.
The regulator believes that the menace would reduce significantly once incumbent telcos implement an AI-ML-based software solution together with proper monitoring and audit mechanisms.
The AI-based solution can be deployed into the core telecom network, and analyses if a sender is a spammer, and takes action accordingly.
Last February, Trai issued a direction to prevent the misuse of header and message templates of principal entities and unauthorised messages from telemarketers, and sought to bring them under DLT or distributor leger technology platform for effective monitoring.
Last year, the telecom watchdog had formed a committee of financial regulators-- Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), to address the unauthorised commercial communication on telecom networks.
The initiative is a part of the sector watchdog's move to crackdown on unwanted or spam communication following rampant fraudulent messages being circulated leading to multi-crore financial losses every month.

"IN-SPACe role clarity to help speed up key clearances, but spectrum allotment mode crucial: Satcom industry",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/in-space-role-clarity-to-help-speed-up-key-clearances-but-spectrum-allotment-mode-crucial-satcom-industry/articleshow/99672269.cms,21-04-2023,"Satellite service operators say that clarity around the role of IN-SPACe – a central regulatory body -- in India’s new Space Policy 2023 will speed up key statutory clearances such as commercial landing rights and market access, and, in turn, hasten the roll out of broadband from space services in
India
.
They, though, are counting on the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to quickly provide clarity on the mode of satellite spectrum allocation to drive delivery of affordable satellite broadband services in India.
The allocation mode of satcom airwaves has been a contentious one with satellite players, including Bharti-backed
OneWeb
and US-based Hughes, categorically saying satellite spectrum must be given administratively as has been the global practice.
Reliance
Jio and Vodafone Idea are opposing this.
The government on Thursday unveiled Space Policy 2023, which allows private low-earth
orbit
(
LEO
) and medium-earth orbit (
MEO
) satellite constellation operators to launch fast broadband-from-space services in India.
“The new space policy has definitely created an enabling environment, and with IN-SPACe now mandated to authorise the gamut of space activities, we are confident our authorisations will be fast-tracked, which will allow OneWeb to roll out satellite broadband services in India later this year,” a top company executive told ET.
Live Events
Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal recently said OneWeb is looking to launch high-speed broadband from space services in India by July, a move which may give it the first mover’s advantage in what is still a nascent market.
Besides OneWeb, companies such as Elon Musk’s Starlink, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, Canada’s Telesat with Tata-backed
Nelco
and the Reliance-SES combine, amongst others, are eyeing India’s satellite broadband market. EY estimates India’s space economy to grow to about $13 billion by 2025 from around a $1billion annual revenue opportunity now.
The industry though is awaiting the sector regulator’s recommendations on the specific airwave bands for satcom services as well as the mode of allocation of such airwaves. The DoT will take the final call on the regulator’s recommendations. The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
has floated a consultation paper, seeking views on whether spectrum allotment for space communications should be done via auctions, the administrative route or any other model.
“The industry now awaits clarity on spectrum allocation, which should be via the administrative route, as is done globally, this is vital for delivering satellite broadband services at affordable rates and boosting satcoms penetration in India,” the OneWeb executive added.
Pranav Roach, president of Hughes Network Systems India, backed the view, saying, price discovery via auction can work in case of cellular mobile spectrum which is exclusive. But that won’t work in case of satellite spectrum, which is not exclusive. “Satellite spectrum can’t be assigned on an exclusive basis, and the reason is that satellite spectrum, along with orbital slots, are not exclusive.”
Nelco’s managing director P J Nath, in turn, told ET that satellite spectrum treatment would play a very crucial role in making satellite communication services a major industry in India. “We are banking on the right government policies which support development of all telecommunication industries, be it satcoms or terrestrial, which can be utilised for the benefit to all citizens, irrespective of their geographical location in India.”
ET’s queries to Starlink, Amazon and Reliance Jio went unanswered at press time.
Space sector experts at the Broadband India Forum (BIF) said the new policy would create a level-playing field to non-government entities (NGEs) through INSPACe and also give a fillip to space sector startups.
“It’s encouraging that private or `NGEs’ that bring operations of their space objects using foreign orbital resources, but under a coordinated and registered Indian ITU filling, and in accordance with extant ITU rules and regulations, will be assisted and incentivised by IN-SPACe,” T V Ramachandran, president, BIF, said. The forum counts satellite biggies OneWeb and Hughes and tech majors such as Cisco, Amazon, Google and
Microsoft
among key members.

5G B2B revenues to outpace B2C: Airtel,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/5g-b2b-revenues-to-outpace-b2c-airtel/articleshow/99388329.cms,11-04-2023,"Bharti Airtel

India
's second largest telco, expects that the 5G technology would generate more revenue in the business-to-business (B2B) segment compared to the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment in the coming year or so and is actively engaged with close to 50 companies across multiple industries to co-develop enterprise use cases, a top executive said.
""We have active conversations with close to 50 (companies) across multiple industries to co-develop use cases-from manufacturing to healthcare to banking... in the next year, there is a lot of expectation that 5G will make more money in B2B than B2C,""
Ganesh Lakshminarayanan

He said 5G for enterprises brings a humongous opportunity to digitise the whole back end including factories, warehouses, supply chain, and ports. ""I think 5G will bring a huge opportunity. Every industry is thinking through what problems they could solve through 5G.""
The Sunil Mittal-led telecom operator is targeting a 5G roll out in all urban areas by September 2023, while its bigger rival
Reliance Jio

5G speed to reduce to half if less spectrum allotted in 6GHz band: COAI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/5g-speed-to-reduce-to-half-if-less-spectrum-allotted-in-6ghz-band-coai/articleshow/99384197.cms,10-04-2023,"India
must allocate more spectrum in mid-band like 6GHz for a seamless 5G mobile service in the country, else 5G download speed would be reduced to 50 per cent, when fully deployed, if less spectrum is allocated in the 6GHz band, the Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI) said on Monday.
In a letter to the
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT), the apex operators' body said that mid-band spectrum like 6GHz provides a balance of wide coverage and capacity which is critical to the rapid and cost-efficient deployment of 5G mobile networks in India and also meets the exponentially increasing data demands, that too at affordable terms.
""Shortage of 6GHz spectrum would compel telecom service providers (TSPs) to densify networks to meet IMT-2020 5G performance requirements, leading to 60 per cent higher annual costs. Without densification, 5G download speed would be reduced to 50 per cent if less spectrum is allocated in the 6GHz band,"" said
Lt Gen S.P. Kochhar
, Director General, COAI.
Currently, only 720MHz is available in the mid-band in India.
Further, the government is considering vacating the spectrum from broadcasters or satellite users in C band (3670-4000 Mhz) for 5G/6G use.
Live Events
However, even this spectrum from C band will not be enough to reach the required 2GHz spectrum for international
mobile telecommunications
(IMT) in mid-band.
""It is essential that 1200 MHz available in 6GHz is allocated for mobile communications in India to get this critical 2GHz spectrum in mid-band,"" the COAI said.
India's significantly higher population density (464 persons/sq km), compared to 36 in the US and 25 in
Brazil
, necessitates spectrum loading happens to the tune of 96 per cent (compared to 40-50 per cent in the US or Brazil).
Average population served by each antenna in India is roughly eight times that of these countries, putting a requirement of almost 4-5 MHz of spectrum/person.
""Wi-Fi services in India already have sufficient spectrum in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands (totaling 688 MHz) to meet the demand for Wi-Fi access in the 2025-2030 period. Wi-Fi Aservices have negligible data offload from IMT mobile to Wi-Fi because India is a mobile-first nation with more than 95 per cent of internet users accessing mobile broadband data,"" read the COAI letter.
It recommended that the most optimal allocation for the country in the 6GHz band is to identify the entire 5925-7125 MHz (1200MHz spectrum for IMT applications), as this would maximise the economic and societal benefits for achieving the national target of a $1 trillion digital economy.

Customs duty recast may make telecom gear imports costlier,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/customs-duty-recast-may-make-telecom-gear-imports-costlier/articleshow/99363120.cms,10-04-2023,"The government has tightened rules around custom duty payments by
telecom gear
importers in a bid to plug leakages to the tune of Rs 500-1,000 crore, a move which may increase the cost of equipment such as routers, modems, set top boxes amongst others shipped from overseas.
The government has amended and deleted certain harmonised system (HS) codes in the Customs Tariff Act to plug leakages and clear the air around custom duty payments by importers.
Officials aware of the details said while most telecom products attract 20% customs duty, there are some nil duty items and several in the 10% category.
“In absence of clarity around identification, many telecom products were being imported at lower duty, resulting in an estimated Rs 500-1,000 crore losses for the central exchequer,” an official told ET on condition of anonymity.
He added the government has not made any changes in custom duty rates but provided clarity in identifying products and removed redundant categories.
Live Events
For instance, the Finance Bill 2023 has deleted a couple of non-relevant HS codes in the First Schedule of the Customs Tariff Act. With the deletion, importers can no longer procure products by terming them as subscriber-end equipment and high bit-rate digital subscriber line systems (HDSL). Further, a clear identification has been given for products, which will allow the government to track the kind of gear being imported.
“Earlier, many products were imported under “others” category of the HS codes as no clear identification was there. Now, we have identified the products and can now monitor the kind of equipment being brought into the country,” the official said.
He added that certain importers were getting products like routers by terming them as subscriber-end equipment as it draws nil duty. “There must be some products with nil duty due to WTO obligations, but importers have to pay the right amount of duty and not masquerade dutiable products under the nil category,” said the official.
For instance, India’s import of telecom parts and subscriber equipment under the “others” category with HS code 85176290 stood at Rs 28,565.69 crore worth of products in FY22, as per data available on the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) dashboard.
The government said it was apprised that some technology-related descriptions need to be better understood by all stakeholders for more effective identification of products and equipment covered under the Tariffs Act. After consultations between DoT and the finance ministry, several HS codes were amended in the Finance Bill 2023 and a couple of codes were deleted.
In March, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs issued a circular stating that the identifier code had to be declared in the bill of entry from April 1, 2023 onwards.
“It is decided that, in terms of the Bill of Entry (Electronic Integrated Declaration and Paperless Processing) Regulations 2018, an identification of products/equipment under 85176290 and 85176990 shall be enabled from the beginning, that is, from the time of filing of import declarations itself, bringing certainty, for which an alpha numeric code/identifier will need to be additionally declared in the bill of entry by the importer with effect from April 1,2023,” the circular said. The government has listed various numeric codes for identification purposes.

are likely to report sequential mobile revenue growth in the fourth quarter of FY23, helped by higher data consumption levels and 4G user additions while
Vodafone Idea
(Vi) is set to report a fall, stung by its continuing trend of heavy customer losses, analysts said.
They, though, expect
Jio
to add more subscribers than
Airtel
as the latter is likely to see some churn in the low-value user segment after sharply hiking base prepaid rates in all 22 circles in the fourth quarter.
ICICI Securities
estimates Jio Platforms (

Airtel and Jio have a headstart on the 5G front, having covered over 500 cities and towns. Vi hasn't yet announced a launch timeline.
JPL's Q4 profit after tax is expected to be flattish at ₹4,877 crore due to higher depreciation and amortisation cost, said ICICI Securities. The house expects Bharti Airtel, in turn, to gain from higher profits from its tower JV,
Indus Towers
, estimating its net profit to jump nearly 60% sequentially to ₹2,531.7 crore in the March quarter.
I-Sec, though, estimates Vi's March quarter net loss to widen to almost ₹8,037 crore amid continuing customer losses.
Analysts expect Airtel to report flattish average revenue per user (ARPU) growth in the March quarter at ₹193 due to the two-months impact of increased base prepaid plans nationally coupled with fewer calendar days in the January-March period.
Jio's ARPU too is estimated to rise 0.5% sequentially to ₹179, primarily driven by growth in its fixed broadband user base and enterprise business. Vi's ARPU in the fourth quarter, in turn, is estimated to rise 1% on-quarter to ₹136, partly helped by an estimated 1.5 million additions in its mobile broadband user base.
Motilal Oswal
estimates Jio and Airtel to report 4 million and 7 million customer additions respectively in Q4FY23 largely at the expense of loss-making Vi, which is expected to lose another 3 million customers, underlying its continuing inability to compete with its financially stronger rivals.
Analysts, though, expect all three telcos to report sequential upticks in average mobile data usage (AMDU) per customer in the March quarter, helped by mobile users upgrading to smart devices.
J M Financial estimates Airtel, Jio and Vi's AMDUs per customer to rise sequentially by 1.5%, 0.5% and 1.5% to 20.6 GB, 22.5 GB and 15.3 GB, respectively, in the period.

Officials said the police force and other public safety agencies use a highly reliable and secured communication network for their day-to-day functions including maintaining law and order, responding to emergency and disaster situations etc.
“The entire police communication system as well as that of the paramilitary has to be full proof as it is concerned with national security,” said the official. For instance, a dedicated exclusive network has been set up to connect all the state capitals with the national capital. Such a network has to be built on an exclusive basis as getting spectrum on lease from telecom operators may jeopardise security, officials said.

Firms can now claim PLI sops for 5G FWA gear made locally,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/firms-can-now-claim-pli-sops-for-5g-fwa-gear-made-locally/articleshow/99249375.cms,05-04-2023,"Telecom gear makers can now claim benefits for locally producing
5G
fixed wireless access (FWA) equipment under the production linked incentive (
PLI
) scheme. The move is expected to boost availability of affordable 5G
FWA
equipment as operators roll out 5G networks at a rapid pace across the country.
FWA is a good use case of 5G but currently the prices of the routers are very high, hampering its uptake, say industry experts. Once companies start getting incentives for such equipment under the PLI scheme, prices are likely to come down as various local and global firms will start manufacturing the devices here.
“The PLI scheme includes 5G consumer premise equipment (CPE) such as FWA. Already, one of the PLI participants is manufacturing FWA equipment. There is a great opportunity to raise the broadband coverage and quality of service using FWA, especially in urban settings,” telecom secretary
K Rajaraman
, told ET.
Specifically asked if the companies can claim financial benefits for manufacturing FWA equipment as part of telecom PLI scheme,
Rajaram
said, “Yes, they can apply to get the
product
included in their approved list and claim thereafter.”
Currently, the prices of FWA routers average over $100, making it unviable for telecom operators to install the equipment at consumer prices as the average revenue per user (Arpu) in India is very low.

Telecom firms in the country usually don’t charge separately for equipment like routers as the cost is included in the tariff package. If the prices of FWA equipment come down by over 50%, it will be a viable option to provide high-speed broadband in areas where fibre is not present. Experts feel that the FWA can complement fibre.
“5G has the potential to significantly improve India's fixed broadband penetration through FWA services in urban as well as rural areas. Currently, fixed broadband penetration by households is close to 10%. Considering the high cost of fibre rollout, 5G FWA has the potential to offer a flexible and cost-effective solution to connect sparsely populated areas,” said Prashant Singhal, TMT Emerging Markets Leader, EY.
He added that the higher bandwidth available in households through FWA would help to connect more devices and offer services such as HD content, remote learning, immersive gaming, and telehealth. “5G FWA could help bridge the digital divide in India,” Singhal said.
As per Ericsson, FWA is the largest 5G use case after mobile broadband. Estimated service provider revenues from FWA worldwide are projected to reach $67 billion by 2028. The growth potential from FWA is especially attractive as it leverages mobile broadband assets to a large degree.
Some experts, though, feel FWA may cannibalise other peer technologies like fibre, and has to be utilised in a prudent manner.
“FWA is an important and powerful option for broadband access and deserves support. However, there is a need to ensure that this doesn't come at the expense of other peer technologies and thus distort competitive markets,” said Mahesh Uppal, director at telecom consultancy Com First (India) Pvt Ltd.

TRAI suggests MIB to design a suitable PLI scheme for STB manufacturing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-policy/trai-suggests-mib-to-design-a-suitable-pli-scheme-for-stb-manufacturing/articleshow/99167500.cms,01-04-2023,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(
TRAI
) has proposed that linear set-top boxes (STBs) be included in the
Production Linked Incentive
(
PLI
) scheme, in its recommendations on 'Promoting Local Manufacturing in the Television Broadcasting Sector'.
The government has developed PLI schemes to encourage domestic manufacturing in sunrise and strategic industries.
TRAI said that hybrid STBs are gaining popularity due to the convergence of services in the television broadcasting sector, which is being driven by the growing demand for digital content online.
""Moreover, such boxes contain part of the functionality of a telecom service as well as enable internet access for viewing digital online content, in addition to performing the function of a conventional set-top box. In a recent notification, DoT has included such hybrid or internet set-top boxes in the list of products eligible for the PLI scheme,"" it added.
Distribution platform operators (DPOs) have been pushing for an extension of the PLI scheme to the broadcasting sector to promote the local production of STBs.

In response, TRAI has recommended that periodic reviews be conducted on the availability of indigenous components needed for broadcasting equipment, including chipsets.
The availability of local components should be factored in when determining the localisation levels under the PLI scheme, the regulator added. Furthermore, TRAI suggested that the investment outlay required to receive PLI scheme benefits be reviewed to encourage MSME manufacturing for selected equipment as identified from time to time.
To transform India's broadcasting equipment manufacturing sector from an import-dependent one to a global hub for indigenous manufacturing, TRAI issued a consultation paper on the matter on December 22, 2021, proactively taking action on the issue.
The regulator has also recommended that a Centre of Excellence may be established for broadcast equipment or that existing Telecom Centres of Excellence may be upgraded to focus on broadcast equipment as well.
It said that organisations like the Telecom Export Promotion Council (TEPC) or some similarly placed organisations should be enabled to promote and facilitate exports of locally manufactured broadcast equipment.
The Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC), Department of Telecommunications, should be mandated to test and standardise all broadcast equipment, the TRAI said in its recommendations.
It also suggested that existing R&D centres in the public sector, such as C-DOT, be strengthened and the local R&D ecosystem be developed along with industry participation through the public-private partnership route.
The regulator has also come up with the idea of creating a ‘Technology Development Fund’ to promote R&D and development of local products and technologies for the broadcasting sector.
TRAI also noted that there is a need to define the scope of ‘local manufacturing’ for different equipment categories in the television broadcasting sector in terms of the percentage of locally sourced components and services.
It also recommended that the
Free Trade Agreements
(FTAs) and other such agreements be reviewed with regard to their impact on local manufacturing in the television broadcasting sector.
