Smart metering programme can help discoms generate Rs 4 lakh crore additional revenue: Care Edge,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/smart-metering-programme-can-help-discoms-generate-rs-4-lakh-crore-additional-revenue-care-edge/articleshow/119741566.cms,30-03-2025,"Power distribution companies (discoms) could generate an additional revenue potential of around Rs 4.0 lakh crore over the next seven years by installing smart meters across India,
Care Edge Ratings
said in a report this week.
Should billing and collection efficiencies improve substantially, the financial gains could exceed initial projections, further bolstering the financial health of the power sector, the rating agency asserted.
India's power distribution sector is undergoing a critical transformation with the push towards smart grids. The implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has shown positive results by far.
The installation of smart meters has been progressing, with around 2.0 crore meters installed by January 2025, according to Care Edge.
However, the report anticipates that
smart meter installations
will reach only 25 per cent of the target of 25 crore meters by March 2026, falling short of the government's set goal.
Live Events
""The ambitious target of installing 25 crore smart meters requires a significant investment of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with Rs 95,000 crore in debt and a 25 per cent equity contribution,"" said the report.
The smart metering system has significant potential, as they play a key role in enhancing power sector efficiency through real-time monitoring, reducing
power theft
, and improving demand forecasting.
However, Care Edge asserts that the rollout of the scheme has been slow due to consumer resistance, operational and maintenance challenges, and delayed budgetary support.
As the smart meter rollout gains momentum, timely policy support, financial incentives, and effective collaboration between power distribution companies and technology providers will be essential to install 25 crore smart meters over the next 3-4 years.
""This will be particularly important after the likely miss of the March 2026 target to fully realise the benefits of smart metering and unlock additional revenue,"" said the report.
Smart meter penetration in India, currently at 5-6 per cent, lags behind developed nations like Japan (100 per cent) and the USA (73 per cent), as well as the global average of 43 per cent.
Now, India is making significant strides with its ambitious plan to install 25 crore smart meters over five years, from 2021-22 to 2025-26, presenting a USD 20-25 billion opportunity for the energy sector under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), which was launched in 2017.
""Moving forward, challenges will remain in achieving consistent progress across states and further accelerating delivery while realising the intended sustainability benefits. Although state regulators and the Ministry of Power mandate this transition, discoms must take a proactive role in managing the change, both at the organisational and consumer levels, to ensure a smooth and collaborative implementation,"" Care Edge said.

"India to build five Bharat nuclear reactors with private participation, soon: Govt",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-to-build-five-bharat-nuclear-reactors-with-private-participation-soon-govt/articleshow/119609160.cms,27-03-2025,"New Delhi: Five indigenously-manufactured modular reactors — named
Bharat nuclear reactors
— will be manufactured in the next few years with the help of private participation in the nuclear sector, the government stated in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. The plan to generate 100 Gigawatt by 2047 is functional with a 170% increase in the nuclear energy budget in the last decade.
Replying to supplementary questions during Question Hour in the Upper House, Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Jitendra Singh said the “out of the box” thinking and decision to remove past “taboos” of not involving private players in the nuclear sector have given a huge impetus to the civil nuclear programme in the country. “India’s focus is to manufacture
small modular reactors
with private participation. These are very relevant to India as it has a heterogenous population located in small, densely populated pockets and factories close-by. Hence, small modular reactors of 300 MW, 16 MW and 200 MW are suitable,” Singh said.
He further informed the House that five small breeder reactors will be completed in the coming years and Rs 20,000 crore has been allocated for this. The categories are 200 MW, 55 MW and 10MW reactors.
India is also collaborating with France and the US along with the private players though the thrust is on indigenous manufacturing.
Brij Lal had posed this starred question on the nuclear mission that was announced in the budget this year. Singh described the nuclear mission as a “path-breaking decision” that has been launched with the singular aim of meeting India’s increasing energy requirement and to provide an environmentally-friendly clean source of energy. “100-gigawatt energy target will be achieved by 2047 which will meet 10% of India’s energy requirements at that time,” he said.
Live Events
Singh highlighted the “revolutionary decision” of opening up the nuclear sector to private players. “Till now, nobody had made this demand or suggestion and it was widely believed that the civil nuclear programme should work under a veil of secrecy,” he said.
India aims to become Net Zero by 2070, the minister said, adding that while earlier India was never taken seriously on the nuclear issue, it is in a leadership role today.
Congress leader Jairam Ramesh sought to know where India stands on Phase-II (Plutonium-based) reactors, when the fast breeder reactor in Kalpakkam will be commissioned, and what is the status of the advanced Phase-III thorium-based reactor that was planned? Singh clarified that 200 MW reactors need not be only small modular reactors and the technology involved determines its status. “300 MW is the cut-off laid down by international agencies. Therefore, it is easier to convert them into small modular reactors,” he said.
On the
Kalpakkam nuclear project
, the minister said, “500 MW critical testing has been done while Phase-II is under commission. The hallmark is that it is a pressurised reactor which will pave the way for the third phase that is thorium based.”
Ramesh credited former PM Jawaharlal Nehru with starting India’s nuclear programme with the help of Homi Bhabha’s “scientific vision and determination”. He said Bhabha envisaged a three-phase nuclear programme — the first based on uranium, then plutonium, followed by thorium. India has 25% of the world’s reserves of thorium but it is “a fertile, not a fissile” material. He said India had long ago mastered Phase-I with 200 MW reactors at Kalpakkam, Rawatbhata, Jaitapur and other nuclear plants.

Installed nuclear energy capacity to reach 13 GW by 2029-30: Minister Jitendra Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/installed-nuclear-energy-capacity-to-reach-13-gw-by-2029-30-minister-jitendra-singh/articleshow/119594293.cms,27-03-2025,"The government on Thursday informed the Rajya Sabha that the installed capacity of nuclear energy in the country will reach 13 GW by 2029-30 from present 8.18 GW, and it will further enhance to 22.5 GW once all sanctioned projects are completed by 2032. This was informed by Minister of State of Prime Minister's Office
Jitendra Singh
in the House during the Question Hour.
""In this Budget a nuclear mission has been announced...I'm sure in the times to come, the history would record that this has been one of the most path breaking decisions in the history of independent India. And if one was asked to define in a single sentence, the hallmark of this decision...is the true vindication of Homi Bhabha's dream,"" the minister said while replying queries of the members.
About private players' participation in the nuclear sector, Singh said an important component of the nuclear mission is that India will go in with the public-private participation, in a big way, in the manufacturing of
small modular reactors
, which are particularly relevant to a country like India.
According to Singh, allowing private participation into nuclear sector is expected to gear up a rapid scale-up of nuclear capacity, for which legislative changes are being pursed to facilitate an active participation and partnership of public and private sector in nuclear.
He further said that nuclear energy is expected to cater to a host of end-uses beyond base-load electricity supply to national grid, like captive power and process heat to industry, electricity and/or fresh water (through sea water nuclear desalination) in isolated grids, and clean hydrogen for hard-to-abate sectors.
Live Events
Beyond 2030, Singh said, there are two national goals for the country - 'Energy Independence by 2047' and 'Net Zero by 2070'.
The optimum energy mix for the future needs to leverage all available energy sources to ensure quality and reliable electricity for nation's energy security at a minimum cost to the consumer.
Nuclear as complimentary source to renewable energy has multiple advantages, which adds to grid stability, balancing and reducing the need for energy storage system, which in turn helps in reducing the need for critical minerals required for battery, he said.
The Union Budget 2025-26 outlines a significant push towards nuclear energy as part of India's long-term energy transition strategy. The government has set an ambitious target of 100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047, positioning nuclear energy as a major pillar in India's energy mix.
Recognising nuclear power as a critical component for achieving energy security and sustainability, the government has introduced the
Nuclear Energy Mission
for Viksit Bharat.
The minister informed that a key highlight of the Union Budget 2025-26 is the launch of a Nuclear Energy Mission, which is focused on research and development (R&D) of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The government has allocated Rs 20,000 crore for this initiative.

"Adani starts getting regular payments from Bangladesh, restores power supply",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-starts-getting-regular-payments-from-bangladesh-restores-power-supply/articleshow/119582766.cms,27-03-2025,"Bangladesh said
Indian billionaire
Gautam
Adani
’s power generation unit resumed full electricity supply to the nation, four months after halving the feed over unpaid dues.
“We’re making regular payments to Adani and receiving power as per our requirements,” Rezaul Karim, chairman of
Bangladesh Power Development Board
, said on Thursday. He didn’t specify the quantum of payments and whether past arrears have been cleared.
Data from BPDB shows Adani increased power supply more than two weeks ago.
Adani Power Ltd.
had halved supply from its 1,600 megawatt coal-fired plant in India’s Jharkhand state in November after a series of missed payments by Dhaka, which was battling a foreign exchange crisis amid a turbulent change of regime. Restoration of supply will help Bangladesh avoid blackouts in the sweltering summer months when temperatures can reach 38C (100.4F) or more.
Shares of the company extended gains after the report, climbing as much as 2% in Mumbai. The stock has declined nearly 5% so far this year.
Live Events
The dues, which had at one point crossed $850 million, now stands at $800 million and the same would be cleared in next six months, people familiar with the matter said. The BPDB had also provided guarantees to reassure Adani’s lenders to ease the company’s working capital crunch, they said, requesting not to be named as the information is private.
A representative of the
Adani Group
did not immediately respond to a request for comments.
The restoration of power is a step to help repair business ties between the two nations.

Imported coal-based units could be allowed peak generation beyond April 30,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/imported-coal-based-units-could-be-allowed-peak-generation-beyond-april-30/articleshow/119554378.cms,27-03-2025,"The power ministry has drawn up a multi-pronged strategy to ensure sufficient electricity supply this summer season when the peak demand is expected to reach a new high of 270 gigawatts (GW), people familiar with the matter said.
The ministry has put in place standard measures to maximise generation capacity, like ensure sufficient availability of coal, maximising hydropower, reducing the number of planned maintenance during the season, and optimising imported coal-based plants.
If required, the mandate for imported coal-based power plants to operate at maximum capacity under Section 11 of the Electricity Act may be extended beyond April 30, a senior government official told ET.
A similar mandate to ensure maximum generation capacity could be extended to gas-based power plants for a certain period to deal with under extreme peak demand scenarios, officials said. The government expects peak power demand this summer to go beyond last year's record 250 GW recorded in May as the
India Meteorological Department
(IMD) has projected the March to May hot weather season to have above-normal maximum temperatures over most parts of the country.
Live Events
In case the IMD revises or updates its projections for the summer, the ministry may take a relook at the peak demand expectations, the official said.
The current peak demand is hovering around 226 GW in solar hours.
Capacity availability
India's installed generation capacity of all sources as of February end was 470.5 GW. The country has added 28 GW power capacity so far this financial year. More capacity in thermal power as well as renewables is expected to be added in the next two months, increasing the support to capacity availability.
A major issue in meeting peak demand is in the non-solar hours when a large capacity, now standing at more than 100 GW, is not available.
The gap is met by other sources like hydropower and thermal power, with the latter bearing the major load.
Until storage is added in the system, base load will be needed in peak hours, said one of the officials cited above.

"Delhi HC upholds ruling on NTPC's Rs 1,891 crore dispute with Jindal ITF",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhi-hc-upholds-ruling-on-ntpcs-rs-1891-crore-dispute-with-jindal-itf/articleshow/119544344.cms,26-03-2025,"The division bench of the
Delhi High Court
on Wednesday refused to stay a single-judge order that set aside a 2019
arbitral award
that asked
NTPC
Ltd to pay damages of Rs 1,891 crore to
Jindal ITF
(JITF), the infrastructure arm of Jindal Saw, for alleged wrongful termination of an agreement for transportation of coal to the state-run company’s Farakka thermal power plant in West Bengal.
The Division Bench led by Justice C Hari Shankar while issuing notice to
NTPC
and others also refused to restrain the PSU from invoking the
bank guarantees
furnished by JITF. “We are aware that this order (single judge’s) needs consideration. It’s not possible to restrain invocation of bank guarantee. However, invocation of BG shall remain subject to the final disposal of this appeal,’ the bench said, while posting the matter for final hearing on April 17.
While Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for NTPC, senior counsel Sandeep Sethi and Amit Sibal represented JITF.
JITF had challenged Justice Dinesh Sharma’s January’s judgment that held that the arbitration award suffered from “patent illegality and is violative of public policy and shocks the conscience of the court. Since the award is so perverse, it has to go in totality.”
Sibal argued that the company “will be out of pocket and will have no money for the development work,” thus NTPC should be restrained from invoking BGs.
Live Events
JITF was selected as the preferred bidder and operator for the transportation of coal for the Farakka plant and a tripartite agreement was entered into between NTPC, JITF and Inland Waterways Authority of India for moving coal through National Waterways-I. The agreement also included the construction of the unloading infrastructure and the material handling system by JITF. As per the
coal transportation agreement
, NTPC was to procure the coal from imported coal suppliers and transport the same through the waterways to JITF, which in turn was to unload and transport it to NTPC's plant at not less than 12,000 tonnes per day
However, a dispute arose between the parties, and it was referred to arbitration in 2017.
The arbitral tribunal in January 2019 awarded total damages of Rs 1,891 crore plus taxes to JITF. The award was challenged by NTPC before the single judge bench on various grounds, including gross violation of the Contract Act and citing that a liability of Rs 417 crore was fastened despite the existence of a ‘no damages clause’.
While claiming damages from NTPC for alleged wrongful termination of the tripartite agreement, JITF said the PSU was responsible for the delay of construction of phases I and II of the material handling system, and accordingly, it was entitled to claim damages for loss of revenue. The tribunal had rejected its counterclaims, virtually re-written the terms of the contract and awarded damages to JITF from the wrong date, NTPC argued.

"India must brace for 9-10% power demand surge in 2025 amid rising temperatures, warn experts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-must-brace-for-9-10-power-demand-surge-in-2025-amid-rising-temperatures-warn-experts/articleshow/119477763.cms,25-03-2025,"India should prepare for a nine to 10 per cent growth in peak electricity demand this summer with the country expected to experience more heatwaves, experts have warned. Last year, the all-India peak electricity demand crossed 250 gigawatts (GW) on May 30, which was 6.3 per cent higher than projections. Climate change-induced heat stress is one of the key factors driving electricity demand.
Currently, industries, households and agriculture account for 33 per cent, 28 per cent and 19 per cent of India's total electricity consumption, respectively. Household electricity demand has grown the fastest over the past decade, according to Disha Agarwal, Senior Programme Lead - Renewables at the Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water.
The share of household electricity consumption increased from 22 per cent in 2012-13 to 25 per cent in 2022-23. Much of this rise can be attributed to economic growth and the increasing need for cooling due to rising temperatures, experts say.
In the summer of 2024, room air conditioner sales surged by 40 to 50 per cent year-on-year amid record-breaking temperatures, Agarwal said.
""India must now brace for extended heatwaves and a peak
electricity demand growth
of 9-10 per cent. However, our analysis shows that this peak demand will only last for a short period,"" she added.
Live Events
Agarwal said India's electricity consumption has been growing at about 9 per cent annually since 2020-21, compared to 5 per cent per year in the previous decade. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) had estimated that electricity demand would grow at a rate of 6 per cent per year from 2022 to 2030.
At the ""Global Heat and Cooling Forum"", organised by the Natural Resources Defense Council last week, experts raised concerns about the increasing demand for air conditioning as summer temperatures continue to rise.
Abhas Jha, Practice Manager, Infrastructure Resilience Policy and Finance for South Asia at the World Bank, said that under a moderate emissions scenario, the number of
heatwaves in India
is expected to triple.
""India is set to become the largest market for air conditioners globally. Every 15 seconds, an air conditioner is sold in India. AC penetration in the country is currently around 8 per cent compared to 90 per cent in developed nations,"" he said.
""AC penetration in India is going to increase. The problem is that most of these air conditioners are highly energy-inefficient -- three-star or unstarred, or unbranded ACs that consume a lot of energy. And if we continue on this trajectory, forget 1.5 degrees Celsius, even 2 degrees Celsius is off the table,"" Jha said.
A few years ago, the International Energy Agency projected that energy demand from air conditioners would triple by 2050, equivalent to adding 10 new air conditioners every second for the next 30 years.
""In spite of that rise, two to five billion people will still lack access to air conditioners in 2050,"" said Radhika Khosla, Research Director of the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Oxford.
She said ongoing research has shown that in a world two degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the largest cooling demand, in terms of total population, will come from India, followed by China, Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Philippines, and the US.
Khosla said achieving thermal comfort for everyone without harming the planet is possible.
This will require a strong focus on passive cooling methods, energy efficiency and phasing out harmful refrigerant gases. These measures can reduce cooling-related emissions by 66 per cent, with the remaining reductions coming from decarbonizing the electricity grid, she said.
The Oxford researcher added that thermal comfort is not just about temperature. It also involves humidity, ventilation, radiant temperature, and clothing insulation. ""Solutions go beyond just switching on one technology,"" she said.
India experienced an exceptionally harsh summer last year, recording 536 heatwave days, the highest in 14 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Official data showed that during one of the hottest and longest heat waves, India recorded 41,789 suspected heat stroke cases and 143 heat-related deaths.
This year, the heatwave arrived much earlier than last year. In 2024, Odisha saw its first heatwave on April 5, but in 2025, parts of Konkan and Coastal Karnataka experienced heatwaves as early as February 27-28.
The IMD has forecast above-normal maximum and minimum temperatures across most parts of the country during the summer season which extends from March to May.

Ratings has removed energy infrastructure company
Adani Energy Solutions
(AESL) from its 'Ratings Watch Negative' list and assigned a Negative Outlook, it said in a statement on Monday. The agency cited concerns over ongoing US investigations that could reveal governance weaknesses and affect financial stability. The agency warned that the outcome of the probe could impact the company's credit profile.
It had affirmed the long-term foreign- and local-currency issuer default ratings at 'BBB-'.
""The risks associated with the group's liquidity and funding requirements have moderated,"" Fitch said in a statement, adding that the proceedings and outcome of the US investigations could reveal that the group's corporate governance practices are weaker than it expected, potentially leading to negative rating action in the near to medium term.
Last November, post the US indictment, Fitch Ratings had placed AESL and
Adani
Electricity Mumbai (AEML) on a ""Rating Watch Negative,"" signalling a potential downgrade for their 'BBB-' ratings.
Fitch assessed that the indictment for alleged securities and wire fraud reflects a corporate governance risk for AESL.
Live Events
""A conviction or any indication of weaknesses in
Adani Group
entities' governance practices and internal controls that may come to light as part of the process could put pressure on the ratings.""
Fitch noted that while AESL has managed to secure funding-raising ₹51 billion through onshore and offshore banking facilities-the outcome of the investigation could impact its future access to capital markets.
AESL's medium-term capital expenditure (capex) plans-expected to surge to ₹17,500 crore annually in FY25 and FY26-could also be affected if access to funding weakens, Fitch added.
Meanwhile, AESL's key subsidiary, Adani Electricity Mumbai (AEML), also had its 'BBB-' rating affirmed. Fitch noted that AEML benefits from a cost-plus tariff model, ensuring predictable revenues from electricity transmission and distribution in Mumbai.

president Tariq Hamid Karra on Saturday said that National Hydroelectric Power Corporation is no less than
East India Company
and is draining the resources of the J&K, besides taking undue consultancy charges from the regional entities.
Karra, while speaking on the budget presented by the Omar Abdullah led government in J&K Assembly, also accused the
NHPC
of inappropriately taking Rs 300 crore as consultancy charges over the last ten years from the regional entity.
“A corporate entity which can be considered nothing less than the East India Company…I am talking about NHPC. Post the commissioning of 900 MW Baglihar power project in 2008 which was independently executed and commissioned by state arm JK Power Development Corporation, NHPC came back as Chenab Valley Power Projects (CVPP) - a joint venture between JKSPDC (49% stake), NHPC(49% stake) & PTC (2% stake),” said Karra in the assembly.
The
Congress
leader said that following the abrogation of special status of J&K in 2019, the NHPC bought the 2 percent stake of PTC in 2021 and subsequently made CVPP its subsidiary. “Why even after this joint venture was created, CVPP still pays consultancy charges to NHPC worth Rs 30 crore every year,” Karra asked. The Congress leader said that calculating it over a period of ten years it appears that NHPC has ‘siphoned at least Rs 300 crore’ from J&K via CVPP.
“Why are the posts of JMD & Chairman in CVPP lying vacant while they had to be filled by J&K cadre officers. Why none of these projects is being headed by a State Government Engineer. Why is the cadre employee of CVPP being discriminated in promotion and other matters by NHPC. These issues warrant serious questioning,” said Karra.

The Congress leader also informed that as per the J&K Mining Department, 70 percent of mining blocks auctioned post-2019 went to non-local firms.
“It is being said that the postings at Chenab region are regarded as Dubai postings due to the illegal exploitation of its resources,” said Karra adding, “There are complaints made in the name of even Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi who have managed to rob our State of its precious mineral wealth sapphire and this exploitation is still continuing unabated.”
The Congress leader also said that if the white paper on the ‘fiduciary policies’ of the last seven years, when the J&K was without any elected government, is prepared it wouldn’t be any short of getting called “Drains of Wealth from J&K.” Karra took the reference from Dadabhai Naroji’s ‘Drain of Wealth’ theory in context of British rule in India.

However, the two figures are not comparable, as 2024 was a leap year.
According to official data, power consumption was 127.34 BU in February 2024.
The highest supply in a day (peak power demand met) also rose to 238.14 GW from 222 GW in February 2024.
The peak power demand touched an all-time high of about 250 GW in May 2024. The previous all-time high peak power demand of 243.27 GW was recorded in September 2023.
Last year, the
power ministry
projected a peak power demand of 235 GW during the day and 225 GW during evening hours for May 2024, while 240 GW during daytime and 235 GW in the evening hours for June 2024.

The ministry had also estimated that peak power demand may hit 260 GW in the summer of 2024.
According to government estimates, peak power demand is expected to touch 270 GW in the summer of 2025.
Experts opine that power demand and consumption will increase in March, which is expected to be hotter than usual, due to the use of fans, coolers and air conditioners.
According to the
Indian Meteorological Department
(IMD), India is likely to experience a warmer than usual March, with a good number of heat wave days.
IMD has projected that monthly maximum temperatures for March are likely to be above normal over most parts of the country, except some southernmost parts of Peninsular India.
The prediction for a warmer March comes as the country experienced the warmest February since 1901, with a mean temperature of 22.04 degrees Celsius, which was 1.34 degrees above the normal of 20.70 degrees.
It has also been projected that during the March to May season of 2025, an above-normal number of heatwave days are likely over most parts of the country except over northeast India, extreme north India and southwestern and southern parts of Peninsular India.

KSK Mahanadi lenders to seek nod to claim excess cash,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ksk-mahanadi-lenders-to-seek-nod-to-claim-excess-cash/articleshow/118667702.cms,03-03-2025,"Mumbai: Creditors to the insolvent
KSK Mahanadi Power
are seeking the National Company Law Tribunal's (
NCLT
) approval to distribute the ₹4,300 crore excess cash in the company, as they race to beat the fiscal year-end deadline for logging some recoveries from this exposure. The ₹4,300 crore of surplus cash is currently on the books of the power producer.
JSW Energy
's ₹16,000-crore offer for the 1800 MW plant was approved by the NCLT last month, but the winning bidder has 90 days to complete the payment, meaning creditors do not expect the cash until May. Creditors will hence approach the NCLT to distribute the cash already present in the company before the resolution process is completed. To be sure, an interim distribution has already happened after the Hyderabad bench of the NCLT in August 2024 had given its go-ahead to distribute the surplus funds in the company. About ₹6,223 crore had been distributed to creditors post that order last year.
""It is estimated that about ₹4,300 crore is still lying in the company which can be used to settle lenders' dues. The NCLT has previously given a go-ahead and all the process is in place. We just want to take an okay from the court. Once that comes we expect some interim distribution to take place this month before the end of the fiscal,"" said a person aware of the developments. Resolution professional Sumit Binani, did not reply to an email seeking comment.
In October 2024, JSW Energy emerged as the highest bidder for KSK Mahanadi Power, offering ₹15,985 crore to
financial creditors
beating the likes of Adani Power, Jindal Power, government-owned NTPC, Vedanta Group and Capri Global in a close contest.
JSW's offer means a total recovery for creditors of more than ₹26,500 crore as the company's resolution plan left the ₹10,500 crore cash and receivables from the company for lenders and also offered future upside with a 26% equity stake in the company. The extra cash in the company along with the equity upside means lenders can hope to get all of their ₹29,325 crore admitted claims from the company, a happy ending after more than five years of delay.
Live Events
KSK Mahanadi was admitted to the
insolvency process
in October 2019 following a petition by
Power Finance Corp
(PFC). The company has 1800 MW of thermal power capacity of three units of 600 MW each, operating in Chhattisgarh, utilising domestically sourced coal which are supplied through a railway line connecting to the plant. The rest of the three units of 600 MW each are in various stages of developments with power purchase agreements in place.
Creditors to the company include banks, NBFCs and bad debt aggregators who have bought the debt from banks over the years as lenders have been frustrated by the delays in recovery proceedings from this account. PFC and its subsidiary Rural Electrification Corp (REC) together control 27% of the debt and are the largest primary creditors. Having acquired debt from banks over the years, Aditya Birla ARC controls 33% of the debt. Among banks,
UCO
and
Bank of India
are the larger creditors with about 3.58% of debt.

Adani power plans to develop 30 GW nuclear capacity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-plans-to-develop-30-gw-nuclear-capacity/articleshow/118461064.cms,22-02-2025,"Adani Power
is planning to set up 30 GW of
nuclear power capacity
, said people aware of the development, as the country's largest private sector power producer seeks to replace its entire thermal capacity with nuclear power in the coming years.
As per industry estimates, setting up a 1 GW small modular reactor (SMR) costs around $5 billion. Adding fuel, the cost inflates to as much as $7 billion.
Adani Power
currently has an operating capacity of 17.55 GW, which it aims to increase to 30.67 GW by 2030.
""The plan is to replace the entire thermal capacity with nuclear. The company will close down the thermal plants as and when the PPAs (power purchase agreements) are finished,"" the people said, adding the company will consider partnering with an international company for technology knowhow.
Live Events
Adani Power did not respond to an email query sent on Wednesday.
Last week, Adani Group chairman
Gautam Adani
and senior officials visited the Tarapur Maharashtra Site, which comprises two atomic power stations, to learn about nuclear power technology and operations.
India's nuclear power sector has turned attractive for homegrown private power producers after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed opening the sector to private firms in the budget and announced a ₹20,000 crore
Nuclear Energy Mission
for research in the field, to set up five SMRs by 2033. She added that at least five indigenously developed SMRs will be operational by 2033 as part of the target of 100 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047.
For achieving an active partnership with the private sector towards attaining this goal, the government will take up amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act. A final decision from companies hinges on these amendments.
India aims to nearly triple its nuclear energy capacity from 8 GW currently to 22 GW by 2032 and this plan aligns with its commitment to achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy by 2030.

Power ministry geared to meet demand surge in summer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-ministry-geared-to-meet-demand-surge-in-summer/articleshow/118459943.cms,21-02-2025,"New Delhi: The
power ministry
is expecting a peak demand of 270 GW in the upcoming summer, higher by 20 GW in FY25, for which adequate supply is prepared. The statement from the ministry comes after power minister Manohar Lal met with major stakeholders in the sector on Thursday and Friday.
The ministry also expects a total of 15 GW of thermal capacity to come online in FY26, Lal said. Currently, the thermal capacity is at 246 GW.
Last year, the peak demand came at 250 GW in the summer months against the expected 260 GW, which was met without shortage,
Central Electricity Authority
chairman Ghanshyam Prasad said.
The ministry will take a call on extending the mandate for the operation of imported coal-based and mandating running full capacity of gas-based power plants if required, secretary Pankaj Agarwal informed.
""We are fully geared up to meet the 270 GW peak demand. If required we will surely invoke section 11 [of the Electricity Act, 2003]. We will take a decision when the situation comes,"" Agarwal said.
Live Events
The Indian carbon market is likely to be launched by mid-FY26, Lal said. The ministry may extend the blending proportion of biomass pellets for power plants to 7% from the current 5% from April, the minister added.
Augmenting Transmission
Transmission capacity addition is needed at a faster pace, Lal said, adding that land and right of way have been major hindrances.
While land prices for transmission lines have been increased, a policy for metro cities and urban areas, where the cost of land is higher, could be brought soon.
The minister also reiterated the work on undersea cable grid connectivity with Sri Lanka which is ongoing.
Projects with UAE and Saudi Arabia for undersea cable projects are in the pipeline, Lal said.
Distribution
Strengthening
The distribution companies have been asked to work on improving their financial health. The Revamped
Distribution Sector Scheme

India ready to meet 270 GW of peak power demand this summer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-ready-to-meet-270-gw-of-peak-power-demand-this-summer/articleshow/118455550.cms,21-02-2025,"India is ready to meet up to 270 GW of peak power demand during summer season this year and the government will make it mandatory for thermal plants, especially those using imported coal, to run at full capacity, Union Power Secretary Pankaj Agarwal said on Friday. In 2024, the country was able to meet the peak power demand of 250 GW during summer against the projected demand of 260 GW.
Addressing a press conference here, Agarwal informed that thermal power plants in the country have sufficient coal stocks of 51 million tonnes, which is enough for generating electricity for 21 days.
""If we require we will invoke Section 11 (of Electricity Act) for meeting the demand,"" Agarwal assured.
The Section 11 allows the government to mandate power producers to operate plants in a specified manner in extraordinary circumstances.
Earlier last year, the power ministry had invoked Section 11 and mandated plants using imported coal to run at full capacity to avoid any shortage of power in the country in view of demand projections.

"India considering bailout for indebted power distribution utilities, document says",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-considering-bailout-for-indebted-power-distribution-utilities-document-says/articleshow/118447546.cms,21-02-2025,"India is considering injecting cash into heavily indebted government-owned power distribution utilities, according to a document from the
Ministry of Power
reviewed by Reuters, to ensure the stability of the sector amid surging power demand.
In the document circulated this week, the ministry mentioned the formation of a group of ministers to identify states that urgently need cash for their utilities, design a ""fiscal discipline program to enable them to avoid a
debt trap
"", and suggest measures to bring private investment.
This would be the first time since 2021 that the federal government has injected money to state power utilities, which cost the government $35 billion then.
The Ministry of Power document also recommended privatising the power distribution utilities, mostly run by states and which cannot easily increase tariffs but face rising power-purchase costs, high transmission and distribution losses, and delays in payment from customers.
The distribution companies had accumulated losses of $75 billion as of the fiscal year that ended in March 2023, about 2.4% of the states' gross domestic product, according to a December 19 report by the Reserve Bank of India. There are 65 power distribution companies run by states.
Live Events
""The financial health of distribution companies (DISCOMS) is crucial for sustaining a reliable and uninterrupted electricity supply to consumers,"" the document said.
""DISCOMs face challenges such as inadequate tariff structures, rising power procurement costs, high transmission and distribution losses, and delayed payment collections, which can lead to revenue shortfalls and operational inefficiencies.""
The ministerial group mentioned in the document met for the first time on January 30 and are expected to meet again this month to further discuss a financial package for the utilities, said two government sources who did not want to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
Reuters could not immediately identify the ministers who are part of the panel. The power ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Power sector will need Rs 6.4 lakh crore investment until FY35: Moody's,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-sector-will-need-6-4l-crore-investment-until-fy35-moodys/articleshow/118397432.cms,20-02-2025,"India's power sector will need ₹4.5-6.4 lakh crore of investment until FY35, which is annually 2% of real GDP over the next 10 years, Moody's Ratings said on Wednesday.
The investment is significant and will be funded by the public and private sectors as well as foreign and domestic capital, it said. It will also need ₹6-9 lakh crore annually over fiscal 2026-51, which is 1.5-2.0% of GDP over the tenure of 25 years, as per the ratings agency.
The requirement is more than what China and Australia will be investing over the same period as a proportion of GDP, it said. The private sector will remain very active in India's renewable energy sector, while government-owned companies will also increase their role.
Conventional bank lending and non-bank financial institutions will be the key sources of debt capital for under-construction projects, while debt capital markets will be key to the refinancing of debt for operational projects, it said.
However, access to long-term low-cost capital and foreign capital will be essential to bridge the funding gap, it said. Solar and wind power will dominate new generation capacity additions over the next 20-25 years, with nuclear and hydropower additions being smaller, it added.

India needs massive investment to meet 2070 net-zero target: Moody’s,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-needs-massive-investment-to-meet-2070-net-zero-target-moodys/articleshow/118380117.cms,19-02-2025,"India
will require significant investment, particularly in the power sector, to achieve its 2070 net-zero commitment, according to a report by Moody’s Ratings. The power sector, which accounts for 37% of the country’s
carbon emissions
, will need funding equivalent to 2% of GDP annually over the next decade and between 1.5%-2% of GDP over the next 25 years.
Moody’s estimates that India’s power sector will require investments between ₹4.5 trillion and ₹6.4 trillion ($53 billion-$76 billion) until FY2034-35. Beyond that, annual investments will range from ₹6 trillion to ₹9 trillion through FY2051. These investments will be shared between public and private players, with both domestic and foreign capital playing a crucial role.
India’s economy is projected to grow at an average of 6.5% annually over the next decade, with power demand rising at a similar pace, Moody's said. While India is expected to add 450 GW of renewable capacity during this period, it will not be sufficient to meet rising demand. As a result,
coal-based power generation
capacity is projected to expand by about 35%, increasing from 218 GW to approximately 295 GW by 2034-35.
Solar and wind power will dominate new capacity additions over the next 20-25 years, while nuclear and hydropower will play a smaller role, Moody's said. Installed generation capacity is expected to double by FY2034-35, supporting a 1.7x-1.8x rise in power demand. The share of non-fossil fuel-based electricity is projected to grow to 45%-50% of total output by FY2034-35, up from around 23.5% in FY2023-24.
The private sector is expected to remain highly active in renewable energy, while state-owned enterprises will also expand their role. Conventional bank lending and non-bank financial institutions will provide debt capital for under-construction projects, while both domestic and overseas debt markets will be key to refinancing operational projects. Moody’s believes that access to long-term, low-cost capital and foreign investment will be critical in bridging the funding gap required for India’s energy transition.

JSW Energy to await CCI clearances before acquiring KSK Mahanadi Power following SC ruling,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/jsw-energy-to-await-cci-clearances-before-acquiring-ksk-mahanadi-power-following-sc-ruling/articleshow/118366365.cms,19-02-2025,"JSW Energy
will wait for all regulatory clearances before committing acquisition funds for
KSK Mahanadi Power
and is seeking legal opinion on the subject as it awaits the anti-trust watchdog's nod for its debt resolution roadmap. The
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT) has already given its approval to the JSW bid.
""JSW is likely to wait for all clearances including CCI, before proceeding with payments and is seeking legal opinion to avoid further challenges,"" a source said.
The development comes in the wake of a recent Supreme Court ruling in the resolution of Kolkata-based Hindusthan National Glass & Industries (HNGIL). The Supreme Court, in a majority judgement, ruled AGI Greenpac's resolution plan for the bankrupt container glassmaker was unsustainable owing to its failure to obtain a prior
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) approval.
The top court held that procedural compliance was non-negotiable, reinforcing the necessity of obtaining CCI clearance before the Committee of Creditors (CoC) approval to ensure fair competition and prevent market monopoly.
This ruling is expected to slow down the implementation of resolution plans, including JSW Energy's takeover process, as the company will likely wait for all necessary clearances before proceeding with payments.
Live Events
This judgment will delay JSW Energy's payments of ₹16,000 crore to lenders for its acquisition of KSK Mahanadi Power Co. despite getting NCLT approval.
An email sent to the company spokesperson remained unanswered until press time.
Legal experts have raised concerns that the ruling complicates the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
(IBC) process, as IBC mandates resolution within 330 days, while CCI approvals have no fixed timeline. This could slow fund recovery for creditors and give unsuccessful bidders more room for legal challenges.
Ketan Mukhija, senior Partner at Burgeon Law, said this ruling is likely to lead to greater scrutiny of resolution plans, potentially prolonging timelines as companies navigate complex regulatory requirements, ultimately affecting market dynamics and competition across various sectors.
""This decision reinforces that regulatory compliance is not just a procedural formality but a fundamental aspect of the corporate insolvency resolution process,"" said Mukhija. ""Moving forward, successful resolution applicants must secure CCI clearance alongside financial planning and approval from the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to ensure their resolution plans are both legally sound and viable.""
Jyoti A Singh, founder of law firm AJA Legal, said this judgement (HNGIL) harmoniously aligns with the objectives of the Code (IBC) by preventing situations where a resolution plan, once approved by the CoC, becomes ineffective if the CCI later denies approval for the proposed combination.
""Such a scenario would not only delay the resolution process but also hinder value maximization for stakeholders, which is a key objective of the Code. Mandating prior
CCI approval
under proviso to Section 31 (4) of the Code ensures a fair and transparent process, balancing the interests of competition law and insolvency resolution,"" said Singh. ""Thus, the judgment reinforces the legislative intent of facilitating an efficient resolution process while safeguarding a competitive market environment,"" she adds further.

"Adhunik Power in talks to refinance Rs 1,500 crore debt",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adhunik-power-in-talks-to-refinance-rs-1500-crore-debt/articleshow/118338324.cms,18-02-2025,"Mumbai: Kolkata-based Adhunik Power & Natural Resources (APNRL) is seeking to refinance around ₹1,500 crore of debt borrowed from
Edelweiss
to lower its cost of funds and is in talks with lenders, including
Kotak Alternate Asset Managers
, and global investors. The company initially took on ₹2,800 crore in debt, but following a restructuring, a portion was classified as unsustainable. The refinancing follows the conversion of a part of this unsustainable debt into a separate instrument. Adhunik Power recently recovered ₹780 crore from discoms, helping reduce its liabilities and improve its financial position.
State Bank of India
had sold a ₹3,200-crore loan in 2017 to Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) under a 15:85 structure, with 15% paid in cash and the rest as security receipts (SRs) to be redeemed over five to seven years. The loan is now valued at ₹2,800 crore, with lenders having received ₹420 crore in cash and ₹2,380 crore in SRs. With the debt maturing in June 2025, Adhunik Power is looking to refinance its obligations. ""The company has initiated discussions with lenders, though talks are still in the early stages,"" said a source. ""They will look to lower borrowing costs by up to 4-5%."" A Kotak spokesperson did not immediately respond, while Adhunik could not be reached for comment.
The company is looking to
refinance debt
at around 18%, down from the earlier 22-23% borrowing costs. The 540 MW power plant struggled to sustain its original debt, especially when valuations dropped to ₹2 crore per MW, justifying only ₹1,100 crore in debt. However, with valuations now improving to ₹3-₹3.5 crore per MW, the viable debt level has risen to around ₹1,600 crore.
Adhunik Power operates a 2x270 MW coal-based
thermal power plant
in Padampur, Jharkhand. The first unit was commissioned in December 2012, with power transmitted through a central transmission utility (CTU) substation near the facility.
The company has long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam, West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company, and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation via
PTC India
, alongside a medium-term deal with Haryana Power Purchase Centre. Despite over a decade of operations, Adhunik Power's debt is high relative to its installed capacity. A 2024 Care Ratings report noted its term debt stands at ₹3.16 crore per MW, underscoring its financial strain.

"NTPC plans to spend $62 billion on 30 GW of nuclear power, sources say",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-ntpc-plans-to-spend-62-billion-on-30-gw-of-nuclear-power-sources-say/articleshow/118329510.cms,17-02-2025,"NTPC
is looking to build 30 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear power capacity over the next two decades, three times more than expected, at a cost of $62 billion, three sources said.
The country's top power producer, which mainly runs coal-fired plants, is seeking land for its ambitious plan in a country where local resistance to such projects is high, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter.
NTPC was targeting 10 GW of nuclear capacity but tripled the goal after the government this month announced plans to open up the sector to foreign and private investment, the sources said.
""NTPC plans to lead India's nuclear power plan just as it did in the...thermal sector,"" one of the sources said. ""The identified sites are promising and hold potential for large capacity addition.""
An NTPC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Live Events
India has committed to setting up 500 GW of non-fossil fuel electricity generation capacity by 2030 and wants to have at least 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047.
State-run Nuclear Power Corp of India is currently the sole operator of the country's nearly 8 GW capacity, aiming for an increase to 20 GW by 2032.
NTPC is already building two 2.6 GW plants with Nuclear Power, one in Madhya Pradesh and one in Rajasthan.
It is also in the process of seeking early approvals for land in eight states for detailed studies in 27 locations, said the sources, after public resistance and acquisition issues have hobbled the country's atomic energy ambitions.
The states include Prime Minister Narendra Modi's native Gujarat in the west, Uttar Pradesh in the north, central India's Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in the south.
LAW CHANGES
The sources said the locations could be enough to set up capacity of at least 50 GW.
Private Indian utilities and conglomerates such as
Tata Power
,
Vedanta
,
Reliance Industries
and
Adani Power
have expressed their interest in nuclear power, Reuters has reported.
NTPC's newly created unit NTPC Parmanu Urja Nigam is likely to make the investments in the sector, including through partnerships, the sources said.
A company executive told Reuters last week that NTPC was in talks about the construction of small nuclear reactors with foreign firms, including from Russia and the United States.
The sources said potential partners include France's EDF, and General Electric and Holtec International from the U.S..
EDF said it was prepared to collaborate with Indian industrial partners to develop a small modular reactor project. General Electric and Holtec did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Modi, during visits to France and the U.S. last week, said the government would work with both countries to develop India's nuclear industry.
The Atomic Energy Act of 1962 currently bars private investments in nuclear power plants, while stringent liabilities under the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010, deter foreign fuel and equipment suppliers such as GE and Westinghouse from signing deals.
Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed amending the two Acts, and promised 200 billion rupees ($2.30 billion) for the research and development of SMRs, at least five of which will be operational by 2033.

"Adani to restore full power to Bangladesh in days but differences remain, say sources",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-to-restore-full-power-to-bangladesh-in-days-but-differences-remain-say-sources/articleshow/118254320.cms,14-02-2025,"Adani Power
has agreed to fully restore supply from a 1,600 MW India
power plant
to Bangladesh in a few days after a gap of three months but has rejected Dhaka's request for
discounts and tax benefits
, two sources told Reuters.
Billionaire
Gautam Adani
's company halved supply to Bangladesh on October 31 due to payment delays as the country battled a
foreign exchange shortage
. This led to the shutdown of one of the two equal-sized units of the plant on November 1, followed by Bangladesh's request to keep supplying only half the power, citing low winter demand and as the payment issue bubbled.
Ahead of summer demand and on
Bangladesh Power Development Board
's (BPDB) request, Adani Power has agreed to resume full supplies by next week, said the two sources who had direct knowledge of the matter but declined to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media. The plant in eastern India sells only to Bangladesh.
Adani Power, however, has not agreed to meet several other demands from BPDB, including giving discounts and concessions potentially worth millions of dollars to Bangladesh, said the sources. The two sides had a virtual meeting on Tuesday and more are likely to carry on the discussions.
""They don't want to give up on anything, even $1 million,"" said one of the sources, referring to Adani Power. ""We have not got any concessions. We want a mutual understanding, they are invoking the power purchase agreement.""
Live Events
BPDB Chairperson Md. Rezaul Karim did not respond to questions about the differences. He told Reuters earlier this week that ""now there is no big issue with Adani"" and that full power supply was going to begin, while he tried to step up payments beyond $85 million a month.
An Adani Power spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said in a statement following a Reuters story on Tuesday that ""dispatch of power by a power generator is dependent on the procurers' requirements, which keep changing"".
In December, an Adani source said BPDB owed the company about $900 million, while Karim said at the time the amount was only about $650 million. The pricing dispute revolves around how power tariffs are calculated.
BPDB earlier wrote to Adani Power seeking tax benefits worth millions of dollars and resumption of a discount programme that ran for a year until May.

NCLT okays JSW Energy's buyout of KSK Mahanadi,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nclt-okays-jsw-energys-buyout-of-ksk-mahanadi/articleshow/118224432.cms,14-02-2025,"Mumbai: The Hyderabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Thursday approved Sajjan Jindal-promoted
JSW Energy
's revival plan for KSK Mahanadi Power Company Ltd (KPMCL).
Bankrupt KPMCL has admitted liabilities of more than ₹32,335 crore. JSW Energy's offer is nearly half of that at ₹15,985 crore.
The NCLT bench comprising judicial member Rajeev Bhardwaj and technical member Sanjay Puri, in an oral order, said the approval was subject to the proposal getting clearance from the Competition Commission of India.
The detailed order was not available at the time of filing the story.
JSW Energy declined to comment while KPMCL resolution professional Sumit Binani did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Live Events
KMPCL owns a 3,600 MW thermal power plant in Chhattisgarh, utilising domestically sourced coal. Half of the capacity (600 MW x 3 units) is operational with power purchase agreements for 95% while the remaining units are under construction.
In November 2019, the bankruptcy court admitted the company under the
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process
in an application filed by
Power Finance Corporation
, after the company defaulted on dues of over ₹1,315 crore.
Six bidders had shown interest in acquiring the company through the bankruptcy process. ET on October 28 reported that in the 11th round, JSW Energy remained the sole bidder. The company offered a 26% equity stake to the lenders and another Rs 100 crore to operational creditors to acquire the company.
After the completion of this acquisition, JSW Energy's locked-in thermal generation capacity would go up to 7.5 GW and total locked-in generation capacity to 28.2 GW.

Of the investment requirement, 40% will be made by the state, but the rest will go through
tariff-based competitive bidding
to build the projects, he said. ""Currently, our transmission capacity is 30 GW and that will become almost 60-65 GW capacity in another five years,"" he said.
The state has a renewable energy installed capacity of around 23 GW and is among the top five states with green capacity, which brings a lot of intermittencies as well as congestion in the transmission system. ""Those tenders will be called soon because the capacity needs to be added fast,"" Pandey said. The state is also focusing on '
distributed renewable energy
', which lightens the burden of transmission lines addition, he added.
The state is also focusing on ‘distributed renewable energy’, which lightens the burden of transmission lines addition, he said, adding: “This congestion (in the transmission lines) will go away.”
Karnataka has prepared its resource adequacy plan for the next decade, which is mostly to add renewable energy in the state, based on which the transmission infrastructure augmentation plan has been made, the official said.

Karnataka Power Corporation is working on developing a coal-based power plant in Chhattisgarh and may go for a public-private partnership on it, Pandey said. “We will give some commitment for purchasing the power from this plant and may sell the rest in the market. That structuring is being discussed.”
This plant is the only state government-owned thermal power capacity that it intends to add, Pandey said, adding that the rest of new capacities will likely be from green power.

NTPC in talks with foreign nuclear firms for small reactors,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-ntpc-in-talks-with-foreign-nuclear-firms-for-small-reactors/articleshow/118218746.cms,13-02-2025,"NTPC
is in talks with foreign firms including those from Russia and the U.S. for construction of small nuclear reactors, a top executive said on Thursday.
Talks for these small modular reactors (SMR) - which have simpler designs than traditional large nuclear plants and can be scaled up to meet demand - come days after the country decided to allow private investments in the sector.
""We have spoken to a Russian company that has an operating small modular reactor, and several other firms like U.S.' Holtec International Corp have also approached us,"" said Prasenjit Pal, executive director and head of nuclear wing at NTPC.
Pal did not identify the Russian company and other U.S. companies, while Holtec did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
NTPC has sought government permission to take forward the discussions, Pal said, but added that no country apart from China and Russia has operating SMR systems.
Live Events
The company would start construction of its first nuclear power project of 2.8 gigawatts (GW) at Mahi Banswara in the desert Rajasthan in 3-5 months, Pal said.
India has about 8 GW of nuclear capacity and aims to raise it to 20 GW by 2032 and at least 100 GW by 2047 to cut its carbon footprint.
A change in Indian laws to open its much-guarded nuclear energy sector is going to boost private investments, Sama Bilbao y Leon, director general of World Nuclear Association, told Reuters on the sidelines of the India Energy Week.
Strict liabilities imposed by India under a 2010 law for compensation to nuclear accident victims have hampered implementation of the country's nuclear deal with the U.S., and with it, participation of U.S. power plant makers such as General Electric and Westinghouse.

""Adani Green Energy has conveyed its Board’s decision to respectfully withdraw from further engagement in the RE wind energy project and two transmission projects in Sri Lanka. However, we remain committed to Sri Lanka and are open to future collaboration if the Government of Sri Lanka so desires,"" a spokesperson at Adani Group said.
Last month, the Sri Lankan government said it had started talks with the Adani Group to reduce the cost of electricity from the projects, which were estimated to cost a total of $1 billion.
""It was learnt that another Cabinet-appointed negotiations committee and Project Committee would be constituted to renegotiate the project proposal,"" the company wrote in a letter to the chairman of Sri Lanka’s Board of Investment. A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters.
""This aspect was deliberated at the Board of our company and it was decided that while the company fully respects the sovereign rights of Sri Lanka and its choices, it would respectfully withdraw from the said project,"" the letter, dated February 12, said.
Live Events
Sri Lanka’s Board of Investment declined to comment, and the power ministry secretary was not immediately available. Adani did not respond right away to a request for comment.
Sri Lanka began reviewing Adani Group’s local projects after U.S. authorities in November accused its billionaire founder Gautam Adani and other executives of being part of a scheme to pay bribes to secure Indian power supply contracts.
Adani has denied the allegations.
Under the deal with Sri Lanka, Adani Green was to build two wind power projects in Mannar town and Pooneryn village, both in the northern province of the country.
The Adani Group is also involved in constructing a $700 million terminal project at Sri Lanka’s largest port in Colombo.
Sri Lanka, which faced severe power blackouts and fuel shortages during its economic crisis in 2022, has been working to speed up renewable energy projects to reduce its reliance on expensive imported fuel.

"India wants to embrace nuclear power. To do it, it'll need a lot of time and money",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-wants-to-embrace-nuclear-power-to-do-it-itll-need-a-lot-of-time-and-money/articleshow/118161499.cms,12-02-2025,"India wants more nuclear power, has pledged over $2 billion toward research and will change laws to boost investment to do it.
The pledges were made by India's finance minister earlier this month as part of a plan to expand electricity generation and reduce emissions. Nuclear power is a way to make electricity that doesn't emit planet-warming gases, although it does create radioactive waste. India is one of the world's biggest emitters of planet-heating gases and over 75% of its power is still generated by burning fossil fuels, mostly coal. India wants to install 100 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2047 - enough to power nearly 60 million Indian homes a year.
Energy experts say that for the world to move away from carbon-polluting fuels like coal, oil and gas, sources like nuclear that don't rely on the sun and the wind - which aren't always available - are needed. But some are skeptical about India's ambitions as the country's nuclear sector is still very small, and negative public perceptions about the industry remain.

PM Modi's meeting with Trump to power up India-US ties with nuclear deals? 'Oh, absolutely!'
To grow the sector, Shayak Sengupta, a senior research associate at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, said the new Trump administration's desire to reconfigure trade could be beneficial. India's nuclear growth plan provides ""ample opportunity"" for U.S. exports, as the nuclear power sector there is much more mature, and companies are working on developments in the technology, like smaller and cheaper nuclear reactors. India is also investing in small reactors.

Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
's is set to meet President Trump on Wednesday. The pair are expected to discuss nuclear power, among other topics, according to India's oil minister.
Nuclear power is around three times as expensive as solar energy in India and can take up to six years to install as opposed to similar amounts of solar that usually take less than a year. Newer small modular reactors are cheaper and faster to build, but they also make less electricity.
India has managed to double the amount of nuclear power installed in the country in the last decade, but it still makes up just 3% of its electricity.
Still, ""the first challenge remains convincing the public to let the projects get deployed in their vicinity,"" said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at the climate think-tank, Ember. Local communities have protested at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in southern India and at proposed nuclear sites in the western state of Maharashtra in the last decade, citing security and environmental concerns.
But for investors and governments, ""the level of interest (in nuclear power) now is the highest it's been since the oil crises in the 1970s,"" said Brent Wanner, head of the power sector unit at the International Energy Agency. That's because it's reliable and clean, he said.
The IEA found that 63 nuclear reactors are currently under construction globally, the most since 1990.
Wanner said governments are critical in getting nuclear power projects underway and India's plan ""very positive"" for the nuclear industry.
Even with its eye on nuclear, India shouldn't forget about other sources of energy that don't emit greenhouse gases, said Madhura Joshi, from the climate think tank E3G.
""Solar, other renewables and storage can come up much faster and quicker,"" Joshi said, delivering ""the immediate solutions that are needed.""

Bangladesh's power dues have fallen from their peak of $1 billion in August 2024 to $700 million now, they said.
Since October 31, 2024, Adani has halved its power supply to Bangladesh due to payment delays, caused by the country's foreign exchange shortage.
In December however, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) had conveyed to Adani to halve power supply due to low demand owing to the onset of winter.
Adani Power
did not reply to an emailed query.
""The power dues are down as Bangladesh is making payments of around $85 million per month to Adani Power,"" said an official aware of the development.
Live Events
According to news agency Reuters, BPDB and Adani officials were due to meet virtually Tuesday following another meeting recently to work out various issues between them.
""As per our requirement today, they have planned to synchronise the second unit, but due to the high vibration, it didn't happen,"" BPDB Chairperson Md. Rezaul Karim told Reuters, referring to some technical problems that stopped the unit from restarting on Monday. ""Right now, we are making a payment of $85 million per month. We are trying to pay more, and our intention is to reduce the overdue. Now there is no big issue with Adani,"" he told Reuters.
Adani Power supplies nearly 1600 MW of power to Bangladesh from its coal-fired plant in Godda, Jharkhand. It has two units of nearly 800 MW each.
It had signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with BPDB in 2015 and meets a tenth of Bangladesh's electricity needs. The PPA is backed by the sovereign guarantee of the Government of Bangladesh.
Its Godda power plant is dependent on imported coal and supplies power to Bangladesh with Fuel Cost pass through. Balance 7.1 GW capacity is located closer to mines of which 84% has fuel supply agreement.

"Nuclear power to be part of energy discussions, says Hardeep Singh Puri",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nuclear-power-to-be-part-of-energy-discussions-says-hardeep-singh-puri/articleshow/118150334.cms,11-02-2025,"NEW DELHI:
Nuclear power
will be part of all
energy discussions
as its commercialisation has not happened yet, largely in the Indian context, even though the country signed a treaty with the US, Union Oil Minister
Hardeep Singh Puri
said on Tuesday. This assumes significance in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US later this week where he will meet US President Donald Trump and have discussion on a series of subjects, including energy.
Earlier on Monday during a presser on India Energy Week 2025, which began here on Tuesday, Puri had said, ""I will be surprised if sourcing of energy from the US does not figure in the discussions (of PM and Trump).""
Puri had also stated that with President (Trump) saying he wants to see global energy prices coming down, he wants more and more energy to come to the market. For countries like India it is a positive development, he said.
During ministerial panel discussion at IEW25, Puri stated, ""Nuclear (power) provides an efficient cost-effective thing but you have to go to a particular route and I'm sure that this is going to be a discussion point in major wherever such discussions take place. I see that happening.""
About the commercial expansion of nuclear power, the minister stated, ""We had signed an India-US civilian nuclear energy deal. We had an India-specific IAEA safeguards agreement but somehow the commercial contracting never took place... But now we're talking about
small modular reactors
.""
Live Events
Earlier this month in her Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a Rs 20,000-crore nuclear mission with an aim of developing at least 100GW of nuclear energy by 2047.
She had said that for an active partnership with the private sector to meet this goal, amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act will be taken up, she informed the House.
A
Nuclear Energy Mission
for research & development of Small Modular Reactors (SMR) with an outlay of Rs 20,000 crore will be set up.
At least five indigenously developed SMRs will be operationalised by 2033.
Talking about the Trump administration, Puri recalled that during his last term as India's permanent representative to the United Nations in New York he had the ""great privilege of knowing Trump when he was not the President"".
""I have the privilege of living in the Trump Tower. He used to visit us every year to have the annual get together of the residents of World Trump Tower. I was the minister in waiting when he came here for first official visit. So I have watched the unfolding events with more than a sense of interest,"" he said.
He also pointed out that we live in an interdependent world and 50 per cent of our(India's) GDP is in the external sector.
The new aspect of (US) adminstration is music to my ears when it says that more energy should come in the market, he stated.
More energy means that prices should come down for a country like India, which is both consumer and producer, he said.
There has never been shortage of energy in the world, he said, adding that there is something called energy poverty.
There are 1.18 billion people who are energy poor. There are 750 million who are lacking electricity and 2 billion with clean cooking solutions.
""I think we can solve that problem easily. That problem should be resolve quickly,"" he suggested.

Bombay HC nod to Adani group to cut 209 mangroves for power line construction,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bombay-hc-nod-to-adani-group-to-cut-209-mangroves-for-power-line-construction/articleshow/118144028.cms,11-02-2025,"Mumbai: The
Bombay High Court
has permitted the
Adani group
to cut 209 mangroves for the construction of a high voltage transmission line proposed to increase electricity supply in the city and suburbs, noting it was a project of public importance. The electricity transmission line construction project is critical for Mumbai as the existing capacity of the transmission corridor is not sufficient to carry any further power into the city, a division bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Bharati Dangre said in its order on February 6.
The HC allowed a petition filed by the
Adani Electricity Mumbai Infra Limited
, seeking permission to cut 209 mangroves near Vasai creek for setting up a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) link between two of its transmission substations.
The project involves an 80 kilometre stretch, of which 30 km would be overhead transmission lines and the remaining 50 km would be underground cable in the mangrove area. The HVDC lines would pass through Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts.
As per the petitioner company, only one kilometre of the HVDC passes through mangrove areas.
The bench in its order said a balance must be struck between the need for sustainable development and requirement to maintain the environment.
Live Events
""The HVDC project would enable additional power to be supplied to Mumbai and suburbs and shall meet the ever increasing energy demands of the city,"" the court said.
""Considering the public importance of the proposed project, which shall benefit the electricity consumers in the city of Mumbai and its suburbs and which will lead to a potential growth, we deem it appropriate to confer the desired permission,"" the HC said.
As per a 2018 order of the high court, there exists a ""total freeze"" on the destruction of mangroves across the state and permission has to be sought from the HC each time an authority wishes to fell mangroves for any public project.
The court noted that as per the transmission license, Adani was required to commission the project by March 2025, and has received all necessary statutory permissions to cut the mangroves.

Narendra Modi
prepares to meet
US President Donald Trump
on February 12-13, nuclear energy and bilateral energy
trade
are expected to take center stage. From
small modular reactors
to liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts, the discussions could pave the way for deeper cooperation between the two nations in the energy sector.
India is doubling down on nuclear power as part of its strategy to decarbonize its energy mix. According to Oil and Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, nuclear energy—especially small and modular reactors—will be a key topic in Modi’s discussions with Trump.
“Oh, absolutely! It is on the agenda,” Bloomberg quoted Puri as saying, at the India Energy Week conference.
According to the Bloomberg report, the government has committed billions to nuclear research and is working on policy reforms to attract private investment. However, the sector has long been constrained by regulatory roadblocks, including stringent nuclear liability laws that make operators and equipment suppliers financially responsible for any accidents.
Despite these hurdles,
NTPC Ltd.
, India’s largest power producer, is in early talks with global technology providers to accelerate its nuclear energy expansion. The move comes at a time when nuclear power is enjoying a resurgence worldwide, recognised as a stable, low-carbon energy source capable of providing round-the-clock electricity.
Live Events
Fueling the future
Beyond nuclear power, Modi and Trump are likely to discuss ways to expand
bilateral energy trade
. The US has emerged as a major supplier of crude oil and LNG to India, and both nations are keen on strengthening this partnership.
“I’d be surprised if sourcing of energy from the US does not figure in the talks,” Puri remarked, highlighting Trump’s focus on increasing global energy supplies and stabilising crude oil prices.
Several Indian state-run firms, including
Indian Oil
,
GAIL
, and
Bharat Petroleum
, are in discussions with US suppliers to secure long-term LNG contracts. The priority is clear—while India imports crude from nearly 40 countries, LNG suppliers are more limited. Diversifying its LNG portfolio is critical, especially since a large portion of India’s existing LNG imports from Qatar are linked to crude oil prices.
According to Oil Secretary Pankaj Jain, India is exploring a balanced approach by including both crude-indexed and gas hub-indexed LNG contracts. The goal is to reduce exposure to price volatility and secure reliable energy supplies for the future.
India eyes stakes in US LNG suppliers
Beyond energy imports, Indian firms are also considering strategic investments in US LNG infrastructure. “We are always open to attractive deals… It has to make economic sense,” Jain stated.
State-run GAIL has been actively scouting for equity stakes in US liquefaction terminals but has yet to find the right opportunity. The company already has a long-term agreement to purchase 5.8 million tonnes per year of US LNG, priced against the Henry Hub benchmark.
With the US now the world’s largest oil and gas producer—and the top LNG exporter—the upcoming Modi-Trump talks could further cement India’s position as a key energy partner.

India’s $67 billion infrastructure gap hampers Modi’s gas goals,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-67-billion-infrastructure-gap-hampers-modis-gas-goals/articleshow/118136477.cms,11-02-2025,"A sprawling liquefied natural gas terminal on India’s scenic southern coast stands testament to the country’s efforts to curb its coal addiction — and to its limited success.
Underutilized since it opened just over a decade ago,
Petronet LNG Ltd.
’s Kochi facility is all but silent. Last year, it operated at barely a quarter of its intended capacity, stranded by a lack of pipelines to ship fuel to towns and industrial centers across the region. It’s a story that repeats itself across the world’s most populous nation.
India’s infrastructure shortfalls have a long and complex list of causes, from uncertain returns that deter investors to local residents’ resistance, to high gas prices and an unfavorable tax regime. All have hampered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s desire to embrace gas — and threatened ambitious plans drawn up by producers like Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE, which have invested billions of dollars in new gas supply with an eye on selling more to India.
“The pipeline network has some major missing gaps, which we need to plug,” Anil Kumar Jain, chairman of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, told a New Delhi conference on India’s gas prospects last month. A regulatory panel is working on policies to make pipeline investments more lucrative, he said.
India aims to more than double the share of gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030, but for about a decade the share has remained static at less than half that level — a headache that will be top of the agenda for attendees gathered at India Energy Week in Delhi from Tuesday.
Live Events
Hitting the target would require gas consumption to rise threefold to 600 million standard cubic meters a day, according to Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. It will also require $67 billion of investment into everything from new pipelines to import terminals and last mile connections.
“This is a subject for all of us to contemplate — can India move from 6% to 15%? Can we help to reduce our emissions and march towards net zero if we do not have a vibrant gas market?” Jain said.
Bloomberg
India currently uses roughly half of a nearly 23,573 kilometer-long gas pipeline network. Even that total capacity, though, can transport only about 60% of the volumes the country needs in order to hit its gas consumption target by the end of the decade, Gajendra Singh, a member of the Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board, said this month.
Many of the pipelines are also idle due to a lack of last mile connectivity. Of the nearly 300 retail gas distribution areas auctioned to companies, about a quarter are not connected to the national trunk lines carrying gas from the domestic fields or the import terminals, dampening demand for the fuel.
All of this means that terminals built to receive inbound shipments are struggling. Only one of India’s
LNG
import facilities runs at full capacity — Dahej, in the western state of Gujarat. The six other plants which were online for the whole of last year ran at an average rate of only 29%, according to BloombergNEF data. The global figure is closer to 40%.
Pipe Dreams
State-run
Gail India
Ltd.’s dominance in gas supplies and transport infrastructure is one concern often cited by developers and blamed for delays.
Getting access to land may be an even bigger headache. A pipeline connecting Gujarat and Punjab is now years behind schedule, in part because of access to land. To lay just 69 kilometers, a fraction of the total, developers have had to negotiate with 4,150 landowners across 26 villages, Deputy Petroleum Minister Suresh Gopi told lawmakers in December. Work began in 2011, but only a fifth of the pipeline is complete.
Regulators terminated a separate project in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh as the developer struggled with approvals and land permits. Nearly 96% of the nine key gas pipeline projects under construction in September had missed their target date of completion, government data show.
Landowners are holding back in part over safety fears, after several accidents in recent years. In June 2014, an explosion followed by a fire at Gail’s gas pipeline in Andhra Pradesh killed 21 and injured 18 people. The accident caused damage to nearby houses, tea stalls and coconut trees spread over a radius of 50 meters. In 2023, a pipeline blast in Bengaluru injured at least three people.
Bloomberg
Change will not come swiftly for India’s LNG industry, with imports still struggling to rise above a 2020 peak. While the nation was the world’s fourth-biggest buyer last year, imports for January fell 12% year-over-year after a surge in spot prices made alternatives — like oil products — more attractive.
India’s focus on self-reliance is also holding back government enthusiasm for a fuel it will have to bring in from abroad — and may ultimately put a cap on demand.
“India has significant resources of coal which is much cheaper. Now renewables are much cheaper. On the other hand higher gas use will increase dependence on imported LNG,” said Manas Majumdar, who leads consultancy PwC India’s oil and gas practice. “While gas use will grow, its share will likely rise to about 10% of the pie by 2030. The 15% target has always been an aspiration.”

Bangladesh seeks full power supply restoration from Adani plant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bangladesh-seeks-full-power-supply-restoration-from-adani-plant/articleshow/118133834.cms,11-02-2025,"NEW DELHI - Bangladesh has asked
Adani Power
to fully resume supplies from its 1,600-megawatt plant in India after more than three months of reduced sales, a Bangladesh official said, when supplies were halved due to low winter demand and payment disputes.
Adani, which signed a 25-year contract under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2017, has been supplying power from its $2 billion plant in India's Jharkhand state. The plant, with two units each of 800 megawatts capacity, sells exclusively to Bangladesh.
The Indian company halved supply to Bangladesh on October 31 due to payment delays as the country battled a
foreign exchange shortage
. This led to the shutdown of one unit on November 1, resulting in the plant operating at about 42% capacity.
Subsequently, Bangladesh told
Adani
to keep supplying only half the power.
The state-run
Bangladesh Power Development Board
(BPDB) said it had been paying $85 million a month to Adani to clear outstanding dues and has now told the company to resume supply from the second unit.
Live Events
""As per our requirement today, they have planned to synchronise the second unit, but due to the high vibration, it didn't happen,"" BPDB Chairperson Md. Rezaul Karim told Reuters, referring to some technical problems that stopped the unit from restarting on Monday.
""Right now, we are making a payment of $85 million per month. We are trying to pay more, and our intention is to reduce the overdue. Now there is no big issue with Adani.""
An
Adani Power
spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In December, an Adani source said BPDB owed the company about $900 million, while Karim said at the time the amount was only about $650 million.
The pricing dispute revolves around how power tariffs are calculated, with the 2017 agreement pricing off an average of two indexes. Adani's power costs Bangladesh about 55% more than the average of all Indian power sold to Dhaka, Reuters has reported.
A Bangladesh court has ordered an examination of the contract with Adani by a committee of experts, with results expected this month. This could potentially lead to contract renegotiations.
Last year, Bangladesh's interim government accused Adani of breaching the power-purchase agreement by withholding tax benefits that the Jharkhand plant received from New Delhi, Reuters reported in December citing documents. Bangladesh officials also said they were reviewing the contract.
A spokesperson for Adani told Reuters at the time that it had upheld all contractual obligations with Bangladesh and had no indication Dhaka was reviewing the contract.
Karim has not replied to Reuters' questions on whether the two sides have resolved their differences.
In November, U.S. prosecutors indicted Adani Group founder Gautam Adani and seven other executives for their alleged role in a $265 million bribery scheme in India. Adani Group has called the U.S. allegations ""baseless"".
In September, the Bangladesh government appointed a panel of experts to examine major energy deals signed by Hasina, who fled to New Delhi in August after deadly student-led protests.

Atomic reactors are seeing a resurgence in global support given their ability to produce significant quantities of low-carbon, continuous power, at a time when nations are pursuing net-zero emissions targets. In India, the sector has languished for years, in part due to concerns over safety, but also because of a law that holds both operators and equipment suppliers liable for damages in case of an accident.
NTPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rosatom, and Korea Hydro also did not respond to requests for comment. A GE Vernova representative declined to comment.
Earlier this month, the government said it would amend the liability law, which originally intended to ensure justice for victims of any nuclear disaster, potentially clearing the path for foreign suppliers to sell to India.
NTPC, along with its units and joint ventures, operates 77.4 gigawatt of capacity, about 17% the country’s total. Close to 90% of that is operated on fossil fuels, according to its website.
The company has formed a joint venture with state monopoly

. to develop a 2.8-gigawatt nuclear power project at Mahi Banswara in the state of
Rajasthan
, and expects to begin civil construction at the site in the quarter starting April, the official said.

"Delhi HC overturns Rs 1,891 crore arbitral award against NTPC in coal transport dispute",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhi-hc-overturns-rs-1891-crore-arbitral-award-against-ntpc-in-coal-transport-dispute/articleshow/117890228.cms,03-02-2025,"The
Delhi High Court
has set aside a
2019 arbitral award
that asked
NTPC Ltd
to pay damages of Rs 1891 crore to
Jindal ITF Ltd
(JITF), the infrastructure arm of
Jindal Saw
, for alleged wrongful termination of an agreement for transportation of coal to the PSU’s Farakka thermal power plant in West Bengal.
The court said that the impugned award suffered from “patent illegality and is violative of public policy and shocks the conscience of the Court. Since the award is so perverse, it has to go in totality,” Justice Dinesh Sharma held.
The HC said that the arbitrator’s obligation to resolve the dispute included an obligation to conduct the arbitral proceedings and decide the case with appropriate care and skill.
A memorandum of understanding was executed in 2008 between NTPC and the
Inland Waterways Authority of India
to explore the possibility of using inland waterways as a supplementary mode of transportation of coal for the Farakka plant. In 2011, Inland Waterways released a request for proposal for the selection of an operator for the transportation of coal through waterways.
The proposal also contained a tripartite agreement to be entered for the purposes of the construction of infrastructure at the Farakka plant site, along with a coal transportation agreement.
Live Events
While JITF was selected as the preferred bidder and operator for the transportation of coal through waterways to the plant, a tripartite agreement was entered between NTPC, JITF, and Inland for moving coal through National Waterways-I. The agreement also included the construction of the unloading infrastructure and the material handling system by JITF.
As per the coal transportation agreement, NTPC was to procure the coal from imported coal suppliers and transport the same through the waterways to JITF, which in turn was to unload and transport the coal from these imported coal suppliers to NTPC's plant at not less than 12,000 tonnes per day
However, a dispute arose between the parties and the same was referred to arbitration in 2017.
While claiming damages from NTPC for alleged wrongful termination of the tripartite agreement, JITF said that the PSU was responsible for the delay of construction of phases I and II of the material handling system, and accordingly, it was entitled to claim damages for loss of revenue.
The arbitral tribunal in January 2019 awarded total damages of Rs 1891 crore plus taxes to JITF. The award was challenged by NTPC before the HC on various grounds, including gross violation of the Contract Act and a liability of Rs 417 crore was fastened despite the existence of a ‘no damages clause and the damages were awarded to JITF from the wrong date. The tribunal had rejected its counterclaims and had virtually re-written the terms of the contract, NTPC said.

"After US, Russia & France look for India fusion in small modular reactors",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/after-us-russia-france-look-for-india-fusion-in-small-modular-reactors/articleshow/117865239.cms,02-02-2025,"Russian nuclear firm Rosatom has offered India the expertise to build
small modular reactors
(SMRs), based on its experience of more than six decades in this sector, said people familiar with the matter. The company might explore the possibility of setting up SMRs in coastal areas of India, they said.
Rosatom, one of the world’s leading civil nuclear firms, is currently developing the
Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project
. Russia has extensive experience in SMR technology, having built many operational projects, according to the people. Last year, Rosatom had offered India cooperation in building small tropical nuclear power stations with the possibility of localisation, including transfer of construction items. Currently, it is the only foreign nuclear firm that is involved in building a nuclear power plant in India.
Separately, in 2024, Rosatom signed a contract with Uzbekistan for the construction of an SMR-based plant, involving both Russian technology and local resources.
This can provide India a roadmap for the development of SMRs, according to a Rosatom executive, who did not wish to be identified. Earlier, a US-based firm had also expressed interest in working with India on SMRs. In January, the visit of the then US NSA Jake Sullivan boosted civil nuclear partnership between the two countries.
India and France have also agreed to work on establishing a partnership on low and medium power modular reactors and advanced modular reactors.
Live Events
The two countries will continue their cooperation on the Jules Horowitz Research Reactor for the development of nuclear technologies and will enhance their exchanges. In 2023, French nuclear firm EDF created a new subsidiary, Nuward, to strengthen the development of its Nuward SMR.
On Saturday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her budget speech that a
Nuclear Energy Mission
for research and development of SMRs will be set up with an outlay of ₹20,000 crore. At least five
indigenously developed SMRs
will be operationalised by 2033, she said.
Sitharaman highlighted that the development of at least 100 GW of nuclear energy by 2047 is essential for energy transition efforts. For active partnership with the private sector towards this goal, amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act will be taken up, she said.

India's power consumption growth subdued at 3 pc to 137.49 billion units in Jan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-growth-subdued-at-3-pc-to-137-49-billion-units-in-jan/articleshow/117855721.cms,02-02-2025,"India's power consumption increased by just 2.7 per cent to 137.49 billion units (BU) in January as use of heating appliances like heater and geysers reduced owing to above normal temperatures. According to India Metrological Department (IMD) the country's mean temperature in January was 18.98 degrees Celsius, the third highest for the month since 1901, behind 1958 and 1990.
According to official data, power consumption was 133.94 BU in January 2024.
Similarly, the highest supply in a day (
peak power demand
met) also rose to 237.30 GW from 222.32 GW in January 2024.
The peak power demand touched an all-time high of about 250 GW in May 2024. The previous all-time high peak power demand of 243.27 GW was recorded in September 2023.
Earlier last year, the power ministry projected a peak power demand of 235 GW during the day and 225 GW during evening hours for May 2024 while 240 GW during daytime and 235 GW in the evening hours for June 2024.
Live Events
The ministry had also estimated that peak power demand may hit 260 GW in the summer of 2024.
According to government estimates, peak power demand is expected to touch 270 GW in the summer of 2025.
Experts opine that power demand as well as consumption remained subdued last month mainly due to decrease in use of heating appliances like heaters and geysers amid day and night temperatures remaining above normal levels.
They further said the growth of power demand as well as consumption will be subdued in February also due to rise in mercury levels.
IMD has projected that most parts of India would experience above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall in February, following a warmer and drier January.
The rainfall in February is likely to be below 81 per cent of the long-period average (1971-2020) of 22.7 mm as per IMD forecast.
Most parts of the country are likely to receive below-normal rainfall, except for some areas in west-central, peninsular and northwest India.
Minimum temperatures in February are expected to be above normal in most regions, except in some parts of northwest and peninsular India.
Similarly, maximum temperatures are likely to be normal to above normal in most areas, except in parts of west-central and peninsular India.
India received an average of 4.5 mm of rainfall in January, making it the fourth lowest since 1901 and the third lowest since 2001.

Budget 2025: All for Nuclear Energy Private Limited,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/budget-2025-all-for-nuclear-energy-private-limited/articleshow/117848876.cms,02-02-2025,"Civil
nuclear energy
in India received a much-needed boost with the budget paving the way for greater private participation by proposing changes in the
Atomic Energy Act
and the
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act
to remove the hurdles.
The government said adding atleast 100GW capacity by 2047 was essential, increasing multi-fold from the current 8GW. ""For an active partnership with the private sector towards this goal, amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act will be tak en up,"" finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her budget speech. The move will attract private as well as public sector funding, a nuclear industry executive said, requesting anonymity.
The new technology of
small modular reactors
(SMRs), considered a gamechanger for hard-to-abate sectors, will get asupport of `20,000 crore for research and development. The
Nuclear Energy Mission
will see at least five indigenously developed SMRs by 2033. “It shows a clear policy shift towards nuclear power in the long term for meeting base load as an alternative to fossil fuel-based thermal sources,” said Anujesh Dwivedi, partner, Deloitte India. The move comes weeks after the US removed restrictions on three leading Indian nuclear entities including Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.
“Nuclear power has been recognised for its inevitable role in Viksit Bharat, that is net-zero compliant. However, challenges remain on fuel supply, financing and implementation of the targets,” Anil Kakodkar, former chairman of Atomic Energy Commission, told ET.
Private sector participation
in atomic energy was first infused in the public-private partnership mode in the budget FY25 with the announcement of
Bharat Small Reactors
(BSR).“100GW in 20 years is an average of 5GW of new nuclear annually. To meet this goal, India will need the proven, reliable and cost-effective 220MW BSR,” said Mehul Shah, CEO & founder of Clean Core Thorium Energy.

Union Budget 2025: India to amend atomic energy & nuclear liability laws to boost nuclear energy capacity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/union-budget-2025-india-to-amend-atomic-energy-nuclear-liability-laws-to-boost-nuclear-energy-capacity/articleshow/117817146.cms,01-02-2025,"In a major move to accelerate the nation’s
nuclear energy ambitions
, the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced plans to amend the Atomic Energy Act and the
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act
, while presenting the
Union Budget 2025
.
These amendments are part of a broader strategy to expand India’s nuclear energy capacity to 100 GW by 2047, reinforcing the country’s commitment to
sustainable energy
and climate goals.
""Power sector reforms we will incentivize
electricity distribution reforms
and augmentation of intrastate transmission capacity by states . This will improve financial health and capacity of electricity companies. Additional borrowing of 0.5% of GSDP will be allowed to states contingent on these reforms. Nuclear energy mission for
Viksit Bharat
will be launched. Development of at least 100 gigawatt of nuclear energy by 2047 is essential for our
energy transition efforts
for an active partic partnership with the private sector towards this goal amendments,"" said the Finance Minister.
The Centre has further outlined a Rs. 20,000 crore outlay to establish a dedicated Nuclear Energy Mission focused on the research and development (R&D) of SMRs. The mission will be tasked with driving innovation in nuclear technologies, particularly in the domestic development of these next-generation reactors.
Meanwhile, Karthik Ganesan, Fellow and Director - Strategic Partnerships, CEEW said that this budget provides a shot in the arm for a sector that has not received consistent funding , despite being one of the older nuclear programmes in the world.

""The R&D efforts needed for an indigenous modular reactor are significant and the 2033 timeline for 5 reactors would put it as one of the fastest to market. International collaboration to accelerate the development and learn from what other countries have done would also be a welcome step,"" he said.
The Finance Minister further announced an ambitious target to operationalize at least five indigenously developed Small Modular Reactors by 2033, positioning India as a global leader in the next-generation nuclear technology. These reactors will contribute to achieving the goal of 100 GW of nuclear energy by 2047, ensuring energy security while aligning with India’s environmental objectives under the Paris Agreement
""For research and development of small modular reactors with an outlay of 20,000 crore will be set up. At least 5 indigenously developed small modular reactors will be operationalized by 20 to 33,"" said the now two-time Union Finance Minister.
The focus on nuclear energy comes as part of India's larger effort to transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix.
""Nuclear power, which is clean and essential for base load, is key to India’s energy transition from fossil fuel. Very crucial reforms to immediately focus on small modular rectors and amend law to expand investment from private sector and the liability cap, will go a long way to achieve target of 100 GW by 2047,"" said Debasish Mishra, Partner & Chief growth Officer, Deloitte South Asia.

Can't afford to ditch coal: Economic Survey 2024 hits India’s energy goals with a reality check,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/cant-afford-to-ditch-coal-economic-survey-2024-hits-indias-energy-goals-with-a-reality-check/articleshow/117786446.cms,31-01-2025,"The
Economic Survey 2024
reinforces the crucial role of coal in India’s energy landscape, noting its ongoing importance as a reliable and affordable source of energy for the country’s development.
Despite global shifts toward renewable energy, the Survey argues that coal cannot be neglected in India’s quest for sustainable development due to the country’s unique resource endowments.
India, which possesses approximately 10% of the world’s coal reserves, has a longstanding reliance on this resource for its power generation.

Global trade spats could derail India's 2070 net-zero goals: Economic Survey 2024
The Survey underscores that, unlike many developed economies that are moving toward green energy alternatives, India remains heavily dependent on coal.
Live Events
This reliance is further amplified by the country’s limited natural gas reserves—only 0.7% of the global total. Given these resource constraints, coal remains the most viable energy source to fuel India’s growing economy and meet the increasing demand for electricity.
No rationale for immediate shutdown
The report makes a strong case against the economic rationale of shutting down coal plants without a dependable and scalable alternative in place.
The Economic Survey notes that most of India’s coal-fired power plant capacity additions occurred during the 2010s, signalling that coal infrastructure is still relatively new and underutilised.
Shutting down coal plants prematurely would result in the waste of substantial investments made in the last decade, leaving these assets stranded without viable alternatives in place.
Such a move, the Survey suggests, would not only be economically unsound but would also hinder India's ability to meet its energy needs and development goals.

Economic Survey offers the Singapore solution for India's cities
While the global trend is leaning toward decarbonisation and renewable energy adoption, India's unique energy challenges require a balanced approach. The Survey stresses that, for India, coal continues to be the backbone of the energy system, providing both affordability and reliability.
The Economic Survey 2024 calls for a pragmatic and measured approach to India’s energy transition. While the country works toward a greener future, it must continue to rely on coal as a key energy source to support development, avoid stranded investments, and ensure energy security.
The path to a sustainable energy future, the Survey asserts, requires a careful balance of renewable energy adoption and continued reliance on coal until viable alternatives can be scaled effectively.

should rethink all of its assumptions about future demand.
Across some 200 charts, clean energy expert Nat Bullard lays out a number of other surprising factors impacting

in his annual presentation released online.
Bullard, an advisor and co-founder of energy information platform Halcyon, shows how new information about fast-developing areas like generative AI and diabetes drugs, which can cut food consumption, adds layers of uncertainty to outlooks.
Already the world is facing a complicated path to net zero, according to Bullard, who previously held roles at BloombergNEF — including chief content officer — until 2023.
For instance, it may have been a record year for
renewable energy
in 2024, but coal and gas demand also climbed.

“We are burning more fossil fuel and emitting more CO2 than ever,” he says. “At the same time we are manufacturing and installing more wind, solar, and batteries than ever before. It is a complex moment.”
Here are some of the other highlights.
Data Isn’t Everything
Global electricity demand growth is poised to accelerate over the next few years but only a fraction of that is forecast to go toward fueling AI. In a scenario meant to reflect the current policy landscape, the International Energy Agency showed in an October report that data centers have a limited role in electricity demand growth between 2023 and 2030.
Bloomberg
Yet the sector faces numerous other challenges, Bullard says. The US interconnection queue — the backlog to hook up new generation projects to the grid — expanded 30% between 2022 and 2023, while the typical wait has tripled in less than two decades.
This means newly completed clean energy sources are not coming online fast enough in the US.
AI Has Greater Efficiency Potential
Data centers in the US and Europe are gobbling up electricity and raising concerns about their climate footprint. Virginia, which hosts more than 300 centers, saw the industry account for about a quarter of electricity consumption in 2023, while in Ireland the sector used more electrons than urban households, Bullard’s presentation shows.
Yet this could all change. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek says its open source foundational models need just a fraction of the training hours required by equivalent US versions.
Bullard says the development likely means that a wave of asset infrastructure like power plants and data centers in the US may crest and then recede.
Bloomberg
“We build infrastructure in boom and bust cycles,” he said. “Which, given the DeepSeek news, is one possibility with today's data center construction boom.”
Drugs Can Reduce Oil Demand
Studies have shown that consumers reduced purchases of chips and other savory snacks more than 11% in the six months after starting drugs for diabetes and weight loss, like
Ozempic and Wegovy
. They also bought 7.2% less cheese and 5.8% less meat. The drugs are creating “profound and durable changes not just in how much people eat but the way they eat,” Bullard says.
Bloomberg
If we end up in a world with 10% less craving for fats, sugars and junk calories that are generated from crops like corn or soybeans, Bullard says the question then becomes: Where do those excess calories go?
Biofuels and bioplastics, both made from agricultural products, are two options. This could ultimately lead to a decrease in demand for oil.
Chinese EVs Are Getting Cheaper
China now manufactures almost 40% of the world’s passenger cars, up from just 3.5% in 2000. Cheap EVs from manufacturers like BYD Co. and Geely Automobile Holdings are now flooding developing markets, eating into market share of companies like Toyota Motor Corp., which have been slower to shift away from internal combustion engine models.
Bloomberg
Falling prices of lithium-ion battery packs, which dropped again to $115 per kilowatt hour in 2024, have helped that transition. Almost two-thirds of the nation’s EVs cost less than an equivalent internal combustion engine car in China, data for the first quarter of 2024 shows. Global battery demand surpassed a terawatt-hour for the first time in 2024, yet the deluge of existing and planned production lines means the sector could be oversupplied through at least the end of the decade.
A surplus could have profound implications for newly established trade flows for used EVs, according to Bullard. “If it turns out that there's no market for used
electric vehicles
to be exported from Europe to West Africa, what happens to all the batteries? Are they recycled? Are they reused?”
Larry’s Letter Says Less About ESG
Green finance continues to advance, albeit slowly, with energy transition infrastructure funds under management nearly $1 trillion. But you wouldn’t know that from public Wall Street statements that suggest a wide retreat from green financing. Perhaps no document is more telling than BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink’s annual letter to investors.
Bloomberg
The 2020 letter mentions terms like climate, ESG and sustainability 46 times. But executives changed their tune after Texas and other US states launched attacks and legal action on the investment management company.
“Larry Fink used to talk quite a bit (in fairly short letters) about climate, sustainability, and ESG,” says Bullard. “Now he does not.”

India's lower coal imports mean bad news for power emissions,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-lower-coal-imports-mean-bad-news-for-power-emissions/articleshow/117774442.cms,31-01-2025,"India
lowered imports of thermal coal by over 5.5 million tons in 2024 from the year before, according to data from Kpler, which may seem like good news to climate trackers monitoring trends in the world's second-largest coal consumer.
But total
coal-fired power generation
hit new highs in India last year, so lower imports mean that higher volumes of domestic coal were burned for power instead, and that's bad news for emissions levels.
India's domestically-mined coal is generally of lower quality and can contain over twice as much ash as most imported coal.
That combination means that power plants need to burn greater volumes of Indian coal than imported coal to generate the same amount of power, and can generate more ash and toxic emissions when burning local coal compared to imported coal.
The trend of using more local coal and reducing coal imports looks set to continue as the government aims to become more self reliant in terms of energy supplies and ensure support for the local mining industry, which is a major employer.
Live Events
And that means India's coal use and power emissions look set to keep climbing even as the country also boosts
renewable energy capacity
and faces growing international pressure to curb coal consumption.
NEW HIGHS
India's power producers generated a record 1,221 terawatt hours of (TWh) of coal-fired electricity in January to November of 2024, according to Ember.
That total was 5.1% more than during the same months in 2023, and marks the fourth straight year of coal-fired expansion.
Coal-fired plants accounted for 73.4% of total electricity generation over the first eleven months of 2024, which is slightly down from 2023's record of 74.2% but remains the highest coal share among all large economies.
Emissions for coal-fired generation also climbed to a new record of 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), and were also up by around 5% from 2023.
WIDER USE
India's consumption of coal for power also expanded geographically in 2024, with a growing share of coal use taking place outside the traditional largest coal-burning states .
Chhattisgarh,
Uttar Pradesh
, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - with a combined population of 475 million - are the top coal-burning states in the country, and have historically accounted for roughly half of India's total coal-fired generation.
In January to November 2024, the share of coal-fired output in those four states dropped to around 45% and the lowest in five years, as growth in other states accelerated.
The collective coal-fired output of the top four coal states was around 552 TWh in January to November of 2024, which is up around 2% from the same months in 2023.
All other Indian states generated 669 TWh of coal-fired electricity in the first eleven months of 2024, which was up 8% from 2023 and the highest on record.
States including Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar and West Bengal all lifted coal-fired output to new highs last year, and rely on coal for over 75% of electricity generation.
Each of those states also saw coal-fired power emissions climb to fresh highs in 2024, and are likely to see further rises in both coal generation and pollution as the country steps up use of locally-sourced coal for power.
And with the ash content of local coal typically around 25% or more, per the Observer Research Foundation, compared to around 10% for imported coal, greater coal use will yield higher emissions.
That in turn will further elevate India's total power sector pollution loads, even as the country tries to roll out growing volumes of clean power capacity. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a market analyst for Reuters.

However, fuel supply and spent fuel handling may remain with the Department of Atomic Energy, the official said.
The government is keen to push
nuclear energy generation
in view of the net-zero target and rising demand for greening of products such as steel, cement and methanol. India's expanding data centre sector is also expected to increase demand for electricity and the government wants this to be met by green power.
It may encourage more capacity addition and private participation to give an impetus for its 2047 goal of becoming a developed nation.
India opened the door for private participation in atomic energy with the union budget for FY25 announcing the government's plan to set up
Bharat Small Reactors
(BSR) in public-private partnerships for captive consumption by industries.
Recently, the
Nuclear Power Corporation
of India issued a request for proposal, inviting industries to set up 220 MW of BSRs for their use, which is in process.
State-owned
NTPC Ltd
has tied up with Nuclear Power Corporation in a 51:49 joint venture to develop the 2,800 MW Mahi Banswara nuclear power project in Rajasthan. The company may further invest ₹3-4 lakh crore to add around 20 GW over the next 23 years, ET had reported.
Atomic energy department secretary AK Mohanty, who is also chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, said last year that there were plans to increase the installed nuclear capacity by 100 GW by 2047.

"JSW Energy revises capex to Rs 10,000 crore in FY '25",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/jsw-energy-revises-capex-to-rs-10000-crore-in-fy-25/articleshow/117737863.cms,30-01-2025,"JSW Energy
has revised its capital expenditure (capex) target for FY'25 to Rs 10,000 crore, down from an earlier estimate of Rs 15,000 crore, citing strategic shifts toward inorganic growth through acquisitions. In the first nine months of the fiscal, the steel major had incurred capex spending of Rs 6200 crore, an official said.
""For the first nine months of FY'25, we have spent about Rs 6,200 crore, and we expect to close the year with around Rs 10,000 crore in total capex,""
Pritesh Vinay
, Director of Finance and CFO, JSW Energy, said during the company's Q3 earnings call.
Initially, the company had projected a capex of Rs 15,000 crore for the year. The higher expected investment in organic projects was impacted by sectoral constraints, particularly around connectivity and related challenges, he said.
""In light of this, we have adjusted our approach by focusing more on inorganic growth opportunities, which will help us continue to deliver a steady growth trajectory at a certain compound annual growth rate (CAGR),"" he said.
The current batch of projects that the company are planning to complete are getting completed, the official added.
Live Events
Vinay elaborated that organic growth, which has proven to be more challenging to scale at this stage, will now be supplemented by inorganic initiatives, providing the company more time to better plan and execute long-term strategies.
The company is allocating Rs 13,000-14,000 crore for the 2.4 GW under-construction renewable projects of O2 Power, a Rs 12,468-crore acquisition by JSW completed in December.
""O2 Power's assets are spread across seven resource-rich states, with 2.3 gigawatts of capacity set to be operational by June '25 and an additional 2.4 gigawatts at various stages of development. The additional capex for the 2.4-gigawatt under-construction and pipeline projects is expected to be between Rs 13,000 crore and Rs 14,000 crore,"" stated JSW Energy Joint Managing Director Sharad Mahendra.
As part of its long-term expansion strategy, JSW Energy aims to reach 10 GW capacity by FY'25 and 20 GW by FY'30. The company's current under-construction capacity stands at 7.8 GW, with land and transmission readiness secured for the projects.
""We are on track to reach 10 gigawatts of capacity by the end of FY '25. Our total under-construction capacity stands at 7.8 gigawatts with signed PPAs, and we have 3.9 gigawatts of capacity where we are expecting PPAs to be signed soon, Mahendra informed.
Discussing the company's financing approach, Vinay highlighted that debt remains under control, with a net debt of Rs 26,500 crore as of December 2024 and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.5x.
Speaking about the BESS system, the company said the 1 GWh battery energy storage system (BESS) is currently under regulatory review.
""Because of recent regulatory developments, there might be a slight delay of a few months, but we are confident in the long-term viability of our energy storage projects,"" an official noted.

India may add 8 GW of thermal power capacity in FY25 against 15 GW target,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-may-add-8-gw-of-thermal-power-capacity-in-fy25-against-15-gw-target/articleshow/117610238.cms,27-01-2025,"New Delhi: A delay in the commissioning of projects will likely see the government adding a total of around 8,000 MW thermal power capacity by the end of the financial year against the target of around 15,000 MW, according to people familiar with the matter.
In FY24, India had added around 6 GW of thermal units. So far in the fiscal year, two thermal units with a total capacity of 1,320 MW have been commissioned, that too in December. The rest are expected to be commissioned by March.
The delays have been attributed to issues in land acquisition, balance of plant work, and supply of material, among others.
The government's target is to add 80 GW of thermal power capacity by FY32 besides the renewable energy target of 500 GW to meet its growing electricity demand.
""The under-construction capacity in the thermal segment currently is about 30 GW, with these projects likely to be commissioned in the next 4-5 years. Most of these projects are delayed beyond the scheduled commissioning timeline owing to the execution challenges, including land-related issues,"" Vikram V, Vice President & Co-Group Head - Corporate Ratings,
ICRA
, said. The ratings agency has maintained that coal-based capacity will see 5-6 GW capacity addition in the ongoing fiscal.
Live Events
India's energy requirement has grown over the years. While FY22 saw energy requirements rise 8.2% year-on-year, FY23 saw a growth of 9.7% and FY24 witnessed 7.4%, according to data from the
Central Electricity Authority
(CEA). In FY25, till November, electricity consumption rose 4.4% to 1.15 trillion units.
While India has vowed to have 50% of its cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, it also needs base load, which is likely to come majorly from coal-based and nuclear power sources.
Thermal power still accounts for 52.9% of India's total installed electricity capacity, though it is set to fall to 42.6% by FY27 and 31.6% by FY32, according to CEA. This is largely because of the higher projected capacity addition in clean energy sources.

"Energy sector demands enhanced investment, PLI boost, and tax reform in Union Budget 2025",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/energy-sector-demands-enhanced-investment-pli-boost-and-tax-reform-in-union-budget-2025/articleshow/117553882.cms,25-01-2025,"As the Union Budget 2025-26 is scheduled to be announced on February 1, the leaders in the energy sector are calling on the government to increase investment in renewable energy, support domestic manufacturing, provide financial support and rationalise tax structure.
Market leaders across the energy spectrum are urging the government to prioritize investments in solar, wind, green hydrogen, energy storage solutions, and grid modernization in the upcoming budget.
The common thread among industry leaders is the need for enhanced policy support to reduce India's reliance on imports and bolster domestic manufacturing, innovation, and energy security.
Dr. Amit Paithankar, Whole-Time Director and CEO of Waaree Energies Ltd., pointed out the critical role of domestic manufacturing, stating, ""The potential extension and enhancement of the PLI scheme would further empower domestic players to scale their manufacturing capacities and accelerate progress toward achieving 500 GW renewable power by 2030.""
""We urge the government to encourage this by introducing targeted tax benefits and capital incentives. Increasing export subsidies for the renewable energy sector from 1% to 5% would significantly enhance India's global standing, while providing accelerated depreciation rates for core renewable assets would allow the industry to adapt to the rapid pace of technological advancements,"" he added.
Live Events
As per the government data, India crossed the 200 GW milestone of total installed renewable energy capacity in September 2024. The total installed non-fossil fuel capacity has further increased to 214 GW in November 2024, which is an increase of over 14 percent as compared to the 187.05 GW in the same period last year. Between April and November of 2024 alone, India added nearly 15 GW of renewable energy capacity, almost double the 7.57 GW added during the same period last year.
Ratul Puri, Chairman of Hindustan Power, emphasized the importance of scaling up investments in
clean energy technologies
, particularly solar and wind.
""The Union Budget 2025-26 is a great opportunity to build on this momentum and accelerate India's energy transition. The budget needs to prioritize investments in solar, wind, green hydrogen, energy storage solutions, and smart grid infrastructure,"" he said.
Additionally, Puri advocates for the enhancement of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for solar components to reduce dependence on imports, strengthen the ""Make in India"" initiative, and improve energy self-reliance.
On the storage front, Debi Prasad Dash, President of the India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA), called for a uniform 5 per cent GST on all battery types, aligning them with the lower GST rate on electric vehicles. Dash noted, ""Lithium-ion batteries are taxed at 18 per cent, while other types of batteries such as lead acid, sodium, and flow batteries face a 28 per cent GST. In contrast, electric vehicles enjoy a 5 per cent GST rate.""
For Prashant Mathur, CEO of Saatvik Green Energy, the focus is on financial relief for manufacturers in the solar space. He suggested that a unified GST policy on solar panel manufacturing and installations, along with preferential lending rates, would provide manufacturers with the support needed to scale production and attract investment.
Mathur also called for tax incentives and a reduction in corporate taxes for renewable energy companies to drive growth in advanced technologies and manufacturing.
Naresh Mansukhani, CEO of Juniper Green Energy, called for a reduction in GST on solar panels and wind turbines from the current 12 per cent to 5 per cent to make clean energy solutions more affordable and accelerate their adoption.
""The current Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the delivered cost of renewable energy has increased the tariff for wind energy and solar-wind hybrid projects, impacting the affordability of clean energy solutions. A reduction in the GST rate on solar panels and wind turbines from the current 12% to 5% is crucial,"" he said.
The renewable energy industry also recognizes the challenges posed by intermittency and the need for robust energy storage systems.
Srivatsan Iyer, Global CEO of Hero Future Energies, noted that continued support for financial mechanisms and a favourable regulatory framework would further drive the sector's growth, particularly for energy storage solutions and grid modernization.
""India is making strides in renewable energy; however, scaling to 500 GW by 2030 demands strategic integration of circular economy principles, infrastructure development, and innovation,"" said Anup Garg, Founder and Director of The World of Circular Economy (WOCE).
Garg called for fiscal incentives and infrastructure development to lower green hydrogen production costs and support its large-scale deployment.
Market leaders highlighted that the renewable energy sector's growth trajectory is expected to continue in 2025, provided the right policy support is in place.
Amit Jain, CEO and Country Manager of ENGIE India, highlighted that long-term tax incentives, expedited land acquisition, and streamlined approval mechanisms for large-scale projects will be key to maintaining this momentum.
He added that a clear roadmap for energy storage solutions and grid modernization is essential to ensure scalability and resilience.

'False and misleading': Adani Group rejects reports of power contract cancellation by Sri Lanka,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/false-and-misleading-adani-group-rejects-reports-of-power-contract-cancellation-by-sri-lanka/articleshow/117521215.cms,24-01-2025,"The
Adani Group
on Friday denied reports that its 484 MW wind power projects in Sri Lanka's Mannar and Pooneryn had been cancelled.
""Reports that Adani’s 484 MW wind power projects in Mannar and Pooneryn have been cancelled are false and misleading. We categorically state that the project has not been cancelled,"" said an Adani Group spokesperson.
The statement comes after reports earlier on Friday indicated that the Sri Lankan Cabinet, led by President
Anura Kumara Dissanayake
, had revoked the company’s power purchase agreement.
The Adani Group clarified that the Sri Lankan Cabinet's decision on January 2, 2025, to reevaluate the tariff approved in May 2024 was part of a standard review process. ""The Sri Lankan Cabinet’s decision of 2 Jan 2025 to reevaluate the tariff approved in May 2024 is part of a standard review process, particularly with a new government, to ensure that the terms align with their current priorities and energy policies,"" the spokesperson said.
Earlier reports suggested that the Sri Lankan government had revoked the power purchase agreement following corruption allegations against Adani's founder,
Gautam Adani
. According to sources within Sri Lanka's energy ministry, investigations have been launched into Adani's local projects, partly due to bribery charges filed against Adani in the United States in late 2024.
Live Events
""The government has revoked the power purchase agreement, but the project itself is not cancelled,"" an official told AFP. ""A committee has been established to review the entire project.""
In May 2024, the previous Sri Lankan administration had agreed to purchase electricity from an Adani wind power facility in the northwest region at a rate of US$0.0826 per kilowatt.
However, the agreement faced opposition from activists who argued that smaller renewable energy projects could provide electricity at nearly two-thirds the cost proposed by Adani's plan.
The 484-megawatt wind power plant in Mannar and Pooneryn is also under legal scrutiny due to environmental concerns and is facing a challenge in Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court.
Despite this, an official document obtained by AFP confirmed that the Sri Lankan cabinet had decided to form a panel to ""re-evaluate"" the construction of the plant, while also confirming the withdrawal from the power purchase agreement. Notably, the ruling party had opposed the deal during its time in opposition.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who took office in September 2024, has prioritized combating corruption and recovering assets believed to be hidden abroad.
The decision coincided with charges brought against Gautam Adani in the U.S. in November 2024, accusing him of making bribe payments and concealing transactions from U.S. investors. The Adani Group has strongly denied these allegations, calling them ""baseless.""
The Adani Group, which has a sprawling business empire across coal, airports, cement, and media, has faced mounting controversy in recent years, including accusations of corporate fraud. However, Adani was the first foreign investor to enter Sri Lanka following its severe financial crisis in 2022.
Adani's proposed $442 million wind power project, approved in February 2023, has faced ongoing setbacks, including legal challenges and now the withdrawal of the power purchase agreement. As investigations and the re-evaluation of the project continue, it remains to be seen how these developments will affect the future of Adani’s operations in Sri Lanka.

Adani Group
, Sri Lanka has officially revoked a power purchase agreement with the Indian conglomerate in the wake of corruption allegations, news agencies reported citing sources from the country's energy ministry on January 24.
The island nation's government led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has initiated investigations into the company's local projects following accusations of bribery against billionaire founder
Gautam Adani
in the United States late last year, reports said.
In May 2024, the previous government had entered into an agreement to procure electricity at a rate of US$0.0826 per kilowatt from an Adani wind power facility that has yet to be constructed in the northwest region of the island.
However, a senior official from the energy ministry disclosed that Dissanayake's cabinet opted earlier this month to terminate the agreement.
""The government has revoked the power purchase agreement, but the project itself is not cancelled. A committee has been established to review the entire project,"" news agency AFP quoted an official as saying.

Several activists had previously contested the agreement, arguing that smaller renewable energy initiatives were offering electricity at approximately two-thirds the cost of Adani's proposal.
The planned construction of Adani's 484-megawatt wind power plant in the coastal areas of Mannar and Pooneryn is also facing a separate challenge in the Supreme Court due to environmental concerns.
An official document reviewed by AFP on Friday confirmed that Sri Lanka's cabinet decided this month to form a panel to ""re-evaluate"" the project's construction, while also confirming the withdrawal from the power purchase agreement, which the ruling party had vocally opposed during its time in opposition.
Dissanayake assumed office in September with a commitment to combat corruption and recover Sri Lankan assets believed to be hidden abroad. Adani was charged in the United States on November 19, accused of making bribe payments and concealing these transactions from US investors, according to New York prosecutors. The Adani Group has dismissed these allegations as ""baseless.""
With a diverse business empire encompassing coal, airports, cement, and media, the Adani Group has faced significant turmoil in recent years due to allegations of corporate fraud. Adani was notably the first foreign investor to enter Sri Lanka following a severe financial crisis that struck the island nation in 2022.
His company's proposed $442 million wind power project received approval in February 2023, but has since been impeded by legal challenges.
Adani Group denies
Reports that Adani’s 484 MW wind power projects in Mannar and Pooneryn have been cancelled are false and misleading, the group later responded saying.
""We categorically state that the project has not been cancelled. The Sri Lankan Cabinet’s decision of 2 Jan 2025 to reevaluate the tariff approved in May 2024 is part of a standard review process, particularly with a new government, to ensure that the terms align with their current priorities and energy policies. Adani remains committed to investing $1 billion in Sri Lanka’s green energy sector, driving renewable energy and economic growth,"" said a group spokesperson.

"Adani Energy bags ₹25,000 cr order",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-energy-bags-25000-cr-order/articleshow/117436476.cms,22-01-2025,"Mumbai:
Adani Energy Solutions
on Tuesday said it has won its largest order yet, worth ₹25,000 crore, for the Bhadla-Fatehpur HVDC (
high voltage direct current
) project. With this, the Adani group company's order book stands at ₹54,761 crore.
Adani Energy Solutions Ltd (AESL) will commission the order in about four and a half years, on a build, own, operate and transfer basis. The order will help increase the company's transmission network to 25,778 ckm and 84,186 MVA transformation capacity.
The company won the project under the tariff-based competitive bidding mechanism. The project will evacuate 6 GW of renewable energy from various zones in Rajasthan beyond Bhadla-III to demand centres in northern India and to the national grid.
The announcement, made during market hours, led to a surge in the company's shares. However,
Adani Energy Solutions
shares ended the session 0.3% lower at ₹813.35 apiece on the NSE on Tuesday, in line with the weakness in the broader market.
""By enabling efficient evacuation of renewable energy from some of the most inhospitable regions of the country and connecting them to the national grid, AESL is playing its role in India's decarbonization journey,"" chief executive officer Kandarp Patel was quoted in a company statement.

The Bhadla-Fatehpur project is the third for Adani Energy Solutions after the Mundra-Mahendragarh Project and the Aarey-Kudus Project, which is currently under implementation. Adani Energy Solutions has also acquired 100% stake in Rajasthan Part I Power Transmission Limited, a transmission service provider.

Ltd, India's largest electricity transmission and distribution company, has won two new transmission projects, helping swell its order book to Rs 54,700 crore -- more than three times of the work order it had at the start of current fiscal in April 2024. In October-December 2024 -- the third quarter of the fiscal year April 2024 to March 2025 (FY25), won two new transmission projects worth Rs 28,455 crore in Rajasthan, related to the renewable energy park, Jefferies said in a report.
The orders include the 25,000-crore
Bhadla-Fatehpur HVDC project
, which is AESL's largest order win till date.
These order wins have pushed up the company's market share in TBCB (tariff-based competitive bidding) orders to 24 per cent, from 17 per cent in the second quarter.
AESL's current order book now stands at Rs 54,700 crore, as compared to Rs 17,000 crore in the beginning of the current financial year. This is the highest order book amongst all private sector transmission companies.
During the quarter, the company commissioned one transmission line, adding over 1000 circuit kilometers to its network, which stands at 26,485 cKM and 84,286 MVA of transformation capacity. As of December 2023, these were 20,422 cKM and 54,661 MVA.
Live Events
In distribution, the company supplies power to over 3 million customers in Mumbai metropolitan and Mundra SEZ regions. During the quarter, Mumbai market saw a 3 per cent year-on-year increase in power sale to 2.57 billion units, while the Mundra market saw a 30 per cent rise to 236 million units.
The company has applied for a parallel distribution license in Navi Mumbai, Kutch, and Ghaziabad-Jewar-Bulandshahr area.
""We believe AESL should see 16 per cent revenue CAGR and 62 per cent profit CAGR in FY24-27E, driven by locked-in growth in both transmission and distribution business,"" Jeferries said. ""Rs 27,300 crore projects are targeted to be commissioned by October 2026"".
In smart metering, AESL was the lowest bidder in the cancelled smart metering tender of 8.2 million meters in Tamil Nadu. This order quantity is not part of AESL's existing pipeline of 22.8 million meters.
AESL said it will participate in the rebidding when it comes up.
Jefferies expects AESL to add 4.5 million smart meters by the end FY25 and 10 million by FY26, of which 7 million will come from existing contracts and balance from new wins.
AESL's capital management program prioritizes reducing volatility in interest costs through long-tenure bonds. The company is also refining its debt management strategy to match the life of respective assets at fixed rates as much as possible.
""AESL's management says it believes in minimising volatility in its asset base across parameters: debt is being refinanced and raised to match the life of the respective asset at a fixed rate as far as possible; vendor back-to-back arrangements to limit the impact of commodity price changes; and land studies for faster project commissioning,"" the report said, adding downside risks include inability to maintain interest rate; and market share loss.

India's power sector has investments opportunity of Rs 40 trillion over next decade: Motilal Oswal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-sector-has-investments-opportunity-of-rs-40-trillion-over-next-decade-motilal-oswal/articleshow/117293721.cms,16-01-2025,"Showcasing the exuberant potential, the Indian
power sector
has an investment opportunity of Rs 40 trillion, driven by accelerating demand, upgradation and transition to clean energy over the next decade, according to a report by
Motilal Oswal
.
The report added that ""triple tailwinds"" will make the Indian power sector lucrative for investors.
The power demand in the country is increasing at 7 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) compared to 5 per cent previously; old power infrastructure needs to be upgraded or replaced as the electricity mix changes (more RE all day), and India's goal of 500 GW of
renewable energy
(RE) capacity by 2030.
""India, instead, is a unique case where burgeoning real GDP/per capita growth, technology upgrades and electrification are all strong undercurrents and could continue to drive power demand higher for years to come,"" the report added.
The report highlighted that with a robust Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth outlook for India, the new demand drivers such as electric vehicles, data centres, and electrification of energy demand will propel the power consumption to grow at 7 per cent over the next decade.
Live Events
One-third of power demand growth is expected to belong to electric vehicles and data centres by 2035, which account for a negligible share of power demand in India today.
""We assume data centre capacity in India will compound at 30 per cent over the next decade and assume 60 per cent/20 per cent/20 per cent penetration (in new vehicle sales) for two-wheelers (2Ws), PVs and CVs by the end of this 10-year period,"" the report added.
Going further, the report highlighted the opportunity in renewable generation and transmission over thermal or exchange space.
It stated that the private sector's lukewarm involvement in thermal increases the possibility of execution errors, backing its assertion over renewable energy.
""Lukewarm participation by the private sector in thermal means the risk of execution slippages is higher. We also like the transmission segment, in which
Power Grid
's Rs 2 trillion capex opportunity for the industry may expand. While energy exchanges should benefit from the expansion of generation and transmission infrastructure and the launch of new products, the regulatory risk related to market coupling remains tough to predict,"" the report added.

VVER-1000 reactor vessel
for the sixth power unit of the
Kudankulam NPP
, which is being built in India according to a Russian design, is being transported to the construction site. The equipment weighing 320 tons was manufactured at the Atommash plant (
Rosatom
's Machine-Building Division) and shipped to the customer on the eve of 2025.
Before sending the reactor vessel on a sea voyage, the equipment was delivered by special motor transport to the plant's pier, where it was loaded onto a river vessel, the destination of which was the seaport of Novorossiysk. Then, in the port, the reactor vessel was placed in the hold of a sea vessel for the 6,000-mile journey to India.
Currently, four new power units are being built at the
Kudankulam
NPP according to a Russian design. The station is being designed, constructed and supplied with equipment subdivisions of the Engineering Division of the Rosatom State Corporation. Contracts for the design and supply of equipment were concluded between JSC Atomstroyexport and ICAEL (Atomic Energy Corporation of India). A set of four
steam generators
for the sixth unit of the Kudankulam NPP in India will be shipped in 2025.
WWER series reactors have been proving their reliability and efficiency for several decades – the operation of NPP power units with WWER in Russia and abroad has exceeded 2 thousand reactor-years. Installations of this type have the potential for long-term use. In particular, reactor installations of this type can form the basis of NPPs planned to be built in the Far East.
""Despite the confident position we have achieved in the nuclear world, we are not standing still. We are developing and making our work more perfect both in terms of equipment design, ensuring an unprecedented level of safety, and in terms of the economic efficiency of our products. We are currently developing a
reactor installation
for a nuclear power plant with increased capacity, more modern operational properties, improved technical and economic indicators for use in Russia and abroad,” noted the general designer of OKB “GIDROPRESS” Valery Kryzhanovsky.

OKB ""GIDROPRESS"" is the main designer of reactor installations with WWER, including the most important equipment - the reactor vessel. The company supports the equipment at all stages of the life cycle - from the development of the technical design to the support of the equipment during commissioning and during operation. Atommash is the flagship of domestic mechanical engineering. It produces complex equipment (reactors, steam generators, etc.) for almost all nuclear construction projects - Kursk NPP-2, nuclear power plants being built with Russia's participation in Bangladesh, India, China, and Turkey.

NCLAT dismisses appeal to stay insolvency proceedings against Indrajit Power,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nclat-dismisses-appeal-to-stay-insolvency-proceedings-against-indrajit-power/articleshow/117169053.cms,12-01-2025,"The
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal
(
NCLAT
) has dismissed a plea to stay the
insolvency proceedings
against debt-ridden
thermal power producer
Indrajit Power. The appellate tribunal said ""no error has been committed"" by the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT), while admitting the plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against the Maharashtra-based company on February 1, 2024, filed by
Yes Bank
.
The said order passed by the Mumbai bench of NCLT was challenged by
Rajiv Munjal
, a director from the suspended board of Indrajit Power, before the NCLAT.
However, NCLAT upheld the NCLT order observing that it admitted the insolvency plea after finding debt and default which is not even questioned in the appeal filed by the suspended board.
""The submission of the appellant (director) that he proposes to enter into settlement, itself makes it clear that debt and default are admitted. In view of the aforesaid, we do not see any good grounds to entertain this appeal,"" said a two-member NCLAT bench on January 7, 2025.
Yes Bank, a financial creditor, has claimed a default of Rs 331.41 crore against Indrajit Power, which presently operates an 85 MW coal-based thermal power plant at Wardha,
Maharashtra
. Later, this loan was substituted by
JC Flower Asset Reconstruction
.
Live Events
When the appeal was considered before NCLAT, Munjal submitted that he was taking steps to settle. NCLAT has granted several opportunities. The last opportunities were granted on October 1, 2024, and on November 5, 2024.
Even when the appeal was taken up last week on January 7, 2025, counsel for the appellant submitted that no settlement could be entered. Following this, the appellate tribunal moved ahead and dismissed the appeal.

So far, from anticipated capacity additions so far through the conventional and non-conventional sources, it is likely that the projected peak demand during solar hours may be met comfortably in both the years, but challenges will remain for non-solar peak demand.
Apart from adding capacities in the thermal and nuclear energy space, and use of otherwise idle gas-based power plants, the Centre has been working to push for battery energy storage systems and pumped storage systems for availability during peak hours.
Many of the contracts offered by renewable energy implementing agencies now have a component of storage.
India's
energy storage market
grew 1.7 times in 2024, reaching a total pipeline capacity of 114 GWh of storage-linked projects, according to Debmalya Sen, India Lead -Energy, World Economic Forum (WEF).
Sen said 20 GWh of the pipeline is battery energy storage system (BESS), and 91 GWh is pumped storage projects (PSP).

India's 2024 power output growth is slowest since pandemic,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-2024-power-output-growth-is-slowest-since-pandemic/articleshow/117042619.cms,08-01-2025,"India's electricity generation grew at its slowest pace in 2024 since the COVID-19 pandemic, an analysis of federal grid regulator data showed, hit by a slowdown in the world's fastest growing major economy.
Power output rose 5.8% annually to 1,824.13 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh), an analysis of daily load despatch data from federal grid regulator Grid-India showed.
Growth in power generation averaged 2.3% in the year's second half, nearly a quarter of the first half's rise of 9.6%, the data showed.
The slackening electricity generation was in line with a softening economy, which grew at the slowest pace in nearly two years during the quarter that ended on Sept. 30.
The slowdown has not shown signs of easing significantly, with India's manufacturing activity growing in December at its weakest pace for the year, amid weaker demand.
Live Events
However, analysts expect a pickup in industrial activity and residential power use stemming from adverse weather to drive growth of 6% to 7% in electricity use in 2025.
""Demand has already picked up in December, with mercury levels dropping and increased usage of heating systems,"" said Sooraj Narayan, head of Asia-Pacific power modelling at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
""Combined with increased industrial production activities, we expect the demand growth rate to be higher in 2025.""
Slowing electricity demand growth and a rise in the share of renewables to a record 12.1% of power generation helped the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gas snap a three-year streak of gains in the share of coal.
The polluting fuel's share in India's power mix fell to 74.4% in 2024, from 75% in 2023.
But the year also saw tepid growth in the renewables sector, with growth of 18.4% in total solar output its slowest since India made international commitments to fight climate change in 2015. Annual wind power output fell for the first time since 2020, the data showed.
Output from hydropower, India's second-largest electricity source after coal, rose 4% in 2024, recovering from a plunge of 13.7% in 2023, but its share in total output fell further to 8.6%.
In 2025, analysts expect both the share of coal and renewables to rise at the expense of natural gas-fired power, which rose 17.3% last year.
""We see a declining share of gas in the generation mix this year due to our forecast of higher year-over-year gas prices,"" said Kesher Sumeet, senior LNG analyst at Energy Aspects.

India doesn't need philanthropic subsidies to promote energy access: Rockefeller Foundation Prez,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-doesnt-need-philanthropic-subsidies-to-promote-energy-access-rockefeller-foundation-prez/articleshow/117028605.cms,07-01-2025,"New Delhi: India doesn’t need much project-specific philanthropic subsidy for enhancing
energy access
but would benefit from expertise that can help build demonstration projects to crowd in private capital and induce ecosystem efficiency, the president of the
Rockefeller Foundation
said.
The Rockefeller Foundation-backed
Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet
(GEAPP) is working on multiple projects across the energy value chain with Indian states to drive up efficiency, build capacity, and promote innovation.
“Here I think we see far less need for project-specific philanthropic subsidy,” said Rajiv Shah, President of the Rockefeller Foundation, adding that the projects should be commercially viable as that’s “the only way” to get to the kind of scale India needs for energy access.
GEAPP is focused on leveraging its intellectual capital to help build an effective ecosystem needed to achieve energy access and efficiency goals in India, Saurabh Kumar, Vice President (India), GEAPP. “It’s not about the amount of money. How do you change the ecosystem, that’s important.”
GEAPP has embarked on a project to digitize the entire electricity distribution company in Rajasthan, which involves mapping every asset of the company, Kumar said. The project, targeted to be completed in 8-9 months, can help plug leakage in the system.

The organization is focused on distributed renewable energy, which could help solve India’s peak power deficit problem, Kumar said, adding that the government’s rooftop solar scheme is “gaining a lot of traction”.
GEAPP is also working on promoting EVs and battery energy storage in India, Kumar said.
GEAPP also signed an agreement with International Solar Alliance (ISA) for the latter’s Multi-Donor Trust Fund, which aims to mobilize $100 million to fund high-impact
solar energy projects

SC agrees to examine Adani Power's appeal in Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission case,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sc-agrees-to-examine-adani-powers-appeal-in-punjab-state-electricity-regulatory-commission-case/articleshow/116999150.cms,06-01-2025,"The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine
Adani Power
's appeal challenging the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission’s refusal to grant approval to a 2006 power purchase agreement (PPA) signed between erstwhile
Udupi Power Corp
and a Punjab state discom.
A Bench led by Justice PS Narasimha issued a notice to the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) and Punjab State Power Corp (PSPCL) on
Adani
Power's appeal challenging the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity’s September order that upheld the Commission’s decision to refuse approval.
The agreement was signed between Udupi Power Corp and Punjab State Power Corp for the supply of 101.5 MW of power, which was 10% of the then proposed installed capacity of the 1,015 MW project located in Udupi, Karnataka. Adani Power is the successor in interest of Udupi Power. The generating company having a 600 MW imported coal-based power project in Udupi district supplies power to discoms in Karnataka, Punjab and Gujarat.
The Commission had refused to approve PSPCL’s proposal regarding procurement of 101.5 MW of power from Udupi in terms of the PPA, saying the need to procure power from Udupi on long-term basis is not established and it would not be economically viable propositions for PSPCL to purchase power from Udupi project at the given price determined by the Central Commission particularly when much cheaper power is available in the market.
Adani Power told the SC that the Commission had refused to approve the agreement after 14 years of its signing and having been acted upon by the parties. The regulatory body had earlier regulated power purchase and approved power procurement by Punjab State Power Corp from Udupi power project, thus the power purchase agreement was deemed to be approved, it said.
Live Events
Stating that PSERC was not justified in refusing approval of the 2006 PPA based on information and material given by PSPCL pertaining to 2020, Adani said that investments were made by its generating companies on the strength of PPAs.
“Banks and financial institutions lend money based on PPAs since they are an assured revenue stream for the generator. Here, the investment by Adani with respect to its 1200 MW Udupi TPS was around Rs 6172 crore. The approach of PSERC and APTEL is destructive over the principle of sanctity of statutory contracts (PPA).""
The Aptel judgment, if allowed to be sustained, in the long term, will jeopardize investments and result in regulatory uncertainty in the power sector as it would give a licence to the distribution companies like PSPCL to sit over for more than a decade, and then turn around and abandon its PPAs signed with generators. “This would thwart the legitimate expectation of generators, and run contrary to the principles of promissory estoppel, and regulatory certainty,” the appeal stated.

India eyes private capital for $107 billion grid expansion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-eyes-private-capital-for-107-billion-grid-expansion/articleshow/116987414.cms,06-01-2025,"India is asking states to attract more private capital to accelerate the expansion of its power transmission network, part of a plan to revamp the country’s grid and accommodate more clean power.
States should monetize their transmission assets by transferring ownership to businesses for a period of time, and re-invest the proceeds into new projects, according to a report by the federal government’s
Central Electricity Authority
. Power regulators should design a pricing system that guarantees predictable revenues for investors, it said.
The nation is planning to invest 9.2 trillion rupees ($107 billion) through 2032 to build more transmission lines, as it seeks to nearly triple its clean power capacity by that time. New networks are also needed to haul power from coal plants being set up to meet rising demand.
A third of the investments needs be spent into regional networks, where the grid is mostly controlled by state-run firms.
“Given other social and economic needs, it may not be feasible for governments to continue this high level of public financing of infrastructure,” the report said. “As such, there is a need to increase private investment. Monetization of brown-field assets offers a less risky and more attractive way for private investment.”
Live Events
Predictable cash-flows would be key to attracting private capital, the agency said. That might mean a departure from the prevalent regulations where most intra-state networks see transmission charges revised every five years. Investors would also look for payment security and a pipeline of assets to be privatized, the report said.

Renewable energy capacity additions may exceed 35 GW in 2025,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/renewable-energy-capacity-additions-may-exceed-35-gw-in-2025/articleshow/116876442.cms,02-01-2025,"India’s
renewable energy
(RE) capacity addition could exceed 35 gigawatts (GW) in 2025 on the back of a strong project pipeline, favourable solar photovoltaic module prices, and an increase in wind manufacturing capacity, according to some industry executives.
However, some companies said a faster pace of capacity addition is needed to meet the government’s target of 500 GW of capacity addition by 2030.
Between April and November of the current fiscal, India added almost 15 GW of renewable energy capacity, nearly double the 7.54 GW added in the same period last year.
The capacity addition in 2025, however, could fall short of an average annual addition of over 60 GW needed to stay on track for 500 GW of capacity addition by 2030, according to some renewable energy companies.
""The current pace of renewable energy capacity addition in India, while significant, falls short of the targets needed to meet the ambitious goal of 500 GW by 2030,"" said Sundeep Gupta, vice chairman and managing director of Jakson Group.

Gupta said India has achieved around 203 GW from renewable sources, including hydro energy, and a substantial contribution of about 94 GW from solar energy. ""This means about 300 GW remains to be added in the next five years, necessitating an average annual addition of over 60 GW to stay on track.""
However, with the government promoting development of ultra-mega renewable energy power parks, India targets to produce 40 GW of capacity by 2025-26.
An aggressive tendering strategy, the launch of the ‘PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana’ and the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment rapidly integrating renewable energy into their operations to reduce energy costs and meet sustainability goals will add to the renewable energy capacity addition.
Till October, India had an installed renewable energy capacity of 201.45 GW, crossing the 200 GW mark, achieving more than 46% of its targeted 500 GW of renewable energy generation capacity by 2030.
""With robust pipeline projects and easing supply chain pressures, fiscal 2025 is expected to add 19-21 GW, supported by moderating raw material prices,"" said Gyanesh Chaudhary, CMD, Vikram Solar Limited.
He said India is actively developing its solar manufacturing capabilities and aims to build its presence across all stages of solar manufacturing over the next two to three years. ""India’s strong manufacturing capabilities and reputation as a supplier of high-quality solar products contribute to strengthening its position as a global player,"" Chaudhary said.
In fiscal 2024, India’s cumulative manufacturing capacity reached about 63 GW for solar modules and approximately 13 GW for solar cells.
Crisil MI&A Consulting foresees
solar power
capacity in India reaching 175-180 GW from fiscal years 2025 to 2030, significantly surpassing the 45-50 GW added between fiscal years 2020 and 2024.
Currently, the nameplate annual manufacturing capacity of solar modules within India is around 67 GW and is likely to be over 100 GW in the next couple of years. However, capacity additions are still required in upstream segments, such as polysilicon production and wafer manufacturing, to create a fully integrated domestic supply chain. Additionally, investments in advanced technology, such as bifacial modules and thin-film technologies, will be crucial for India to remain competitive.
In wind energy, India has achieved 47 GW capacity. The year 2025 is set to be game-changing for the sector, with industry projecting 20–30 GW of renewable capacity addition, in which wind will grow by double digits.
""We need to stick to the CEA recommended energy mix of 300:100:100 (that is 300 GW of solar, 100 GW of wind, 100 GW of hydro and other RE sources). Largely, both solar and wind will comprise of 80% of the total mix,"" said Girish Tanti, vice chairman, Suzlon Group, adding that while challenges like delayed power purchase agreements and grid infrastructure remain, the proactive steps taken by both central and state governments give confidence that these hurdles will soon be crossed.

The chief minister said, “We can’t back out of contracts unless concrete proof is available. We will have to pay stiff penalty. No action can be taken until concrete proof is obtained. We need more proof. Concrete action will be taken if charges are confirmed.” Naidu made the remarks while interacting with reporters in Vijaywada on Tuesday evening. This is only the second time that Naidu has spoken after the US bribery charges came to the fore in November. Earlier, Naidu had promised action in the case on November 22 in the state Assembly. He had termed the allegations as “damaging” in his statement and said, “More facts are yet to come to light. The government is also thinking about what steps to take as facts are being unravelled as we speak. We will take stock of the situation, see what needs to be done, and will take action accordingly… If there is wrongdoing, action must be taken. That’s the only way to ensure the same mistake won’t be repeated.”
On Tuesday, Naidu termed the controversy as a “laddoo” moment in a reference to allegations of ghee adulterated with lard used in Tirupati laddoos. “If I had to take action against Jagan on the SECI issue, this is a laddoo opportunity,” said Naidu adding, “It’s a question of credibility of the state government. I don’t indulge in vendetta politics. This is the difference between TDP and YSRCP.”
Naidu’s dilemma over taking action stems from Opposition’s attack on BJP-led NDA government over favouring billionaire
Gautam Adani
. Taking action and cancelling contracts would not only go against coalition dharma but will mean Naidu is joining forces with the Opposition.
The bribery allegations stem from court filings by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which claimed that industrialist Gautam Adani met Jagan Mohan Reddy in August 2021 after Andhra Pradesh did not sign a power supply agreement with the government-run Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). The US Justice Department claimed that an unnamed Andhra Pradesh government official was offered kickbacks to the tune of Rs 1,750 crore, aimed at facilitating state distribution companies to buy solar power from SECI. SECI signed power purchase agreement (PPA) for 4666 MW with Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) and 2333 MW with Azure Power. Later, Azure backed out and this capacity was transferred to AGEL.

Delhi's December peak power demand hits record 5213 MW,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhis-december-peak-power-demand-hits-record-5213-mw/articleshow/116832058.cms,31-12-2024,"New Delhi:
Delhi
's winter power demand on Tuesday morning surged to the highest levels, crossing the 5000 MW mark for the first time in December, according to the State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC).
The power demand clocked 5213 MW at 10:50 am alone on Tuesday, it said.
Forecasts from State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) indicate that Delhi's peak power demand this winter could surpass 6300 MW, setting a new seasonal high.
The plummeting temperatures are driving Delhi's power consumption to new highs, with this winter season showing signs of mirroring the record-breaking power demand witnessed during the summer of 2024, when it peaked at 8656 MW.
The two key power distribution companies, BSES RajdhPower Limited (BRPL) and
BSES Yamuna Power Limited
(BYPL), managed to meet the surging demand in their respective areas.
Live Events
The December figures underscore the growing challenge of managing Delhi's power supply during extreme weather conditions.
Last winter, the peak hit 5816 MW, marking the highest level recorded in the national capital. Within the BRPL and BYPL areas, winter peaks previously hit 2529 MW and 1210 MW, respectively; this winter, they are projected to exceed 2600 MW for BRPL and 1240 MW for BYPL.
In 2022, the December peak demand stood at 4964 MW, demonstrating a steady year-on-year increase.
The officials added that BSES discoms are focusing on strategic power planning, precise demand forecasting, and maintaining a robust distribution network to to deliver reliable power year-round.
These measures are set to ensure consistent power availability for more than 50 lakh consumers covering 2 crore residents in South, West, East and Central Delhi during the coming winter months.
BSES has secured over 2000 MW of renewable energy to maintain a reliable and eco-friendly supply, as per official.
This green power mix includes 840 MW of solar power, 546 MW of hydro power, 500 MW of wind energy, 40 MW of waste-to-energy, and over 180 MW from rooftop solar installations across Delhi's neighbourhoods.
With this varied mix, green energy will provide up to 53 per cent of BSES' peak winter power demand, which is anticipated to surpass 3900 MW.
As per the officials, BSES discoms are leveraging mechanisms like banking, power exchange, and maintaining spinning reserves to ensure consistent power availability.
If demand unexpectedly spikes, BSES is prepared to secure short-term power from the exchange, as per the officials.
Advanced load forecasting will also enhance reliability by ensuring demand is predicted with precision, they stated.
As per the officials, the BSES discoms will bank surplus power with states in need of extra energy during winter to maximise efficiency.
This banked power will flow back to Delhi in the high-demand summer months. BRPL plans to bank up to 210 MW, while BYPL aims to bank up to 575 MW, supporting states like Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Kerala, which reciprocated with power support during Delhi's peak summer months.

Govt asks imported coal-based power plants to run at full capacity till Feb 28,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/govt-asks-imported-coal-based-power-plants-to-run-at-full-capacity-till-feb-28/articleshow/116733730.cms,28-12-2024,"The government has extended the direction for
imported coal-based power plants
to run at full capacity till Feb 28, people aware of the development said. There are 15 imported coal-based power plants including
Tata Power
Co. Ltd’s Coastal Power Gujarat,
Adani Power Mundra
Ltd,
Essar Power
Gujarat, and
JSW Ratnagiri
.
The power ministry's direction for thermal plants using imported coal to operate at full capacity to meet increasing electricity demand ends December 31. The total capacity of these plants is around 17 GW, significant to meet the
peak power demand
, which has been constantly rising and is anticipated to rise further.
The directive comes under Section 11 of the Electricity Act, which provides that the government may, in extraordinary circumstances, ask a power generation company to operate and maintain any station in accordance with its directions.
The latest extension is aimed at ensuring adequate capacity amid continued increase in power demand, a government official said.
The government expects peak power demand at 237 GW in January, 234 GW in February and 240 GW in March, according to an official. The evening and early morning peak, when solar power capacity is not available, is expected to be 215 GW in January, 212 GW in February and 223 GW in March.
Live Events
Since the ICB capacities are needed to meet peak power demand, the government has been working on a solution for bringing their cost down. The ministries of power and coal are deliberating on ways to include domestic coal as part of the fuel which is currently not possible because of the design of the plants and sufficient availability of higher-grade coal in the country.
Rough industry estimates suggest the current energy charge rate, excluding fixed cost, is about Rs 4.1-5.6 per unit for the imported coal-based plants. In the case of domestic coal-based plants, the total tariff, including fixed cost, could range from Rs 2.5 to Rs 5.5 a unit depending on fuel transportation costs.

Citing
Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission
(DERC) orders, Sachdeva told a press conference here the ""PPAC imposed by the three discoms has been reduced by more than 50 percent, and resultantly the consumer bills will be reduced by 20-25 percent"".
The PPAC is added to the electricity bill to compensate for any increase in the cost of power during procurement due to factors like rise in fuel prices, changes in policies among others.
It is calculated as a per cent of the sum of the fixed charge and energy charge (units consumed) in power bills.
The PPAC is levied under the Electricity Act, Rules and APTEL orders. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) allows central gencos like NTPC, NHPC and transcos to make full recovery of their costs on a monthly basis
On the other hand, Delhi discoms are allowed PPAC on a post-facto quarterly basis with the approval of the DERC.
The PPAC is recovered to ensure timely pass through of the adjustment cost charges to the consumer as any delay further burdens the consumer with interest cost, officials said.
Also, without PPAC, discoms will have liquidity stress and won't have money to pay the generation companies, they added.
This charge revision is a huge relief for power consumers of Delhi as the PPAC has been significantly reduced by the DERC, said East Delhi Resident Welfare Association Front president BS Vohra.
The charges kept increasing continuously in the last few years burdening the middle class , he said, expecting further reduction.
In case of BRPL and BYPL the existing PPAC was applicable till 20th December 2024.
In the current PPAC approved by an Order, dated 20.12.2024 passed in case of BRPL and BYPL, the DERC has allowed only the recovery of costs for Q2 of FY 24-25.
In case of TPDDL, the existing PPAC is applicable upto 31st January 2025. Its petition is pending before the DERC which may announce a fresh PPAC in coming weeks.

The government previously said expensive foreign technology and manpower were some of the hurdles in achieving the target. But with cities like New Delhi and Kanpur some of the most polluted in the world, India's government is under pressure to reduce the impact of the sectors' emissions.
Instead of FGDs, government officials have proposed deploying locally made electrostatic precipitators that remove fine particles such as dust and smoke from emissions and are one-fifth of the cost of an FGD system, according to a document from the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Indian government summarising a Nov. 13 meeting between the Office and the ministries of power, coal and the environment.
Representatives of the ministries and Ajay Kumar Sood, the principal scientific adviser to the government who chaired the meeting, did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
Live Events
The document showed several of the attendees agreed Indian power plants would be better off focusing on cutting emissions of tiny particulate matter that can lodge deep in the lungs rather than on sulphur reductions.
""This is due to the predominance of other pollution sources in urban areas and the very low sulphur content of Indian coal coupled with the effective dispersion of (sulphur dioxide) generated from thermal power plants due to the tall stacks and the climactic conditions in India,"" the document cited R. Srikanth, the head of the engineering school at India's National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), as saying.
Srikanth did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The document cited a NIAS study that said Indian coal, which is used to generate 92% of the country's thermal power, has a sulphur content of only 0.5%. The range globally is 0.5% to 5%.
The study said the coal's high ash content was a bigger problem for power plants, and high-efficiency electrostatic precipitators would be better at curbing that pollution.
The document also cited government-backed studies by the NIAS, Indian Institute Of Technology (IIT) Delhi and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute that showed power plants with the FGD systems showed negligible improvement in air quality. A FGD system costs 12 million rupees ($141,000) per megawatt of capacity.
Insisting on FGDs could hamper India's goal of increasing coal-fired capacity by 37% by 2032 to meet surging power demand, it said.
A decision will be made based on further consultations, the document showed. India's government policy think tank, NITI Aayog, earlier this year proposed halting FGD installations.
The document also showed that while the government is working on its decision, the
power ministry
last month asked the environment ministry to extend the deadline for FGD installation by another three years beyond 2026. The original deadline was 2017.
Environmental groups say coal-fired plants account for about 80% of industrial emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides in India, which cause lung disease and acid rain. According to a 2019 Greenpeace report, India was the world's largest emitter of sulphur dioxide, with most coming from coal-fired power plants.
IIT Delhi said in its report that in the longer term, the focus should be on cleaner-energy sources and India should phase out older and less efficient coal-based plants.
""The installation of FGD systems and carbon capture technologies should not be used as a smokescreen to justify the continued power generation from these unsustainable, CO2-intensive sources,"" it said in its report, which was reviewed by Reuters.

Bangladesh owes Tripura Rs 200 crore in unpaid electricity bills,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bangladesh-owes-tripura-rs-200-crore-in-unpaid-electricity-bills/articleshow/116592170.cms,23-12-2024,"Bangladesh owes Tripura Rs 200 crore in electricity dues but no decision has been taken on halting power supply to the neighbouring country yet, Chief Minister Manik Saha said on Monday. Tripura supplies 60-70 megawatts of power to the neighbouring country according to an agreement signed by the Tripura State Electricity Corporation Limited through the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited with the Bangladesh Power Development Board.
""Bangladesh has not paid us about Rs 200 crore for supplying electricity. The outstanding (amount) is increasing every day. We hope that they will clear their dues so that the power supply is not disrupted,"" Saha told PTI here in an interview.
Asked whether the Tripura government would stop the supply of electricity if Dhaka fails to pay the dues, the chief minister said no decision has been taken on it yet.
He said several pieces of machinery at the power generation plant in Tripura were brought through either Bangladeshi territory or Chittagong port. Therefore, out of gratitude,e the Tripura government started supplying power to the country following a pact.
""But I don't know how long we will be able to continue the supply of electricity to Bangladesh if they don't clear the dues,"" he said.
Live Events
Tripura began supplying power to Bangladesh in March 2016. The electricity is produced at the state-owned ONGC Tripura Power Company's (OTPC) gas-based 726 MW generation capacity power plant in southern Tripura's Palatana.
According to reports,
Adani Power
, which exports power to Bangladesh from its 1,600 MW Godda plant in Jharkhand, reduced the supply to 520 MW from around 1,400-1,500 MW in August due to non-payment of USD 800 million by the country.
Asked about the impacts on Tripura due to the reported attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, Saha said there is no major influx from the neighbouring country to his state yet.
""But we are closely monitoring the situation along the border since the border is porous as there are many gaps. However, as of now, there is no major influx from Bangladesh after the present turmoil started in that country in August,"" he said.
Tripura is surrounded by Bangladesh on its north, south and west and the length of its international border is 856 km, which is 84 per cent of its total border.
Commenting on the recent breach of security at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala, the chief minister said he had taken strong action in the case.
""We have arrested several people who were involved in it. We have also taken action against policemen who were responsible for the security of the premises where the breach took place,"" he said.
Saha said after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh, trade has been affected and the import of Bangladeshi goods to Tripura has come down significantly.
He said among the goods that come to Tripura from Bangladesh are cement, stone chips and Hilsa fish. ""Supply has been disrupted. It is their loss,"" he said.
Asked about the communication network with Bangladesh, he said if the railway line is restored between Agartala and Dhaka, it would be immensely beneficial for both the country.
""If Chittagong port is allowed to be used without any disruption, the entire Northeastern states will be significantly benefitted,"" he said.
The direct road distance to Chittagong port from Agartala is around 175 km.
A rail line linking Agartala with Akhaura in Bangladesh was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his then Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina on November 1, 2023.
The project has a length of 5.46 km in India and 6.78 km in Bangladesh.
The cost of the Indian portion was Rs 708.73 crore and funded by the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER).
The cost of the Bangladesh portion was Rs 392.52 crore. The Bangladesh portion is funded by the Ministry of External Affairs India and executed by the Bangladesh Railway.
If the overland transport right is allowed by Bangladesh, the travel time between Agartala and Kolkata is expected to come down from about 30 hours to about 10 hours.
The existing train commute distance between the two cities is 1,581 km and it requires a re-route via Guwahati and Lumding in Assam. This would be curtailed to 460 km, officials said.

"Adani Group to invest Rs 28,000 crore in Bihar for power, cement, food processing projects",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-group-to-invest-rs-28000-crore-in-bihar-for-power-cement-food-processing-projects/articleshow/116493418.cms,20-12-2024,"The Adani Group, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, is set to make significant investments in Bihar, amounting to approximately Rs 28,000 crore, as part of its aggressive expansion strategy.
The conglomerate plans to invest in multiple sectors including energy, cement, food processing, and logistics, aiming to boost both local development and job creation.
Pranav Adani, Director of
Adani Enterprises Ltd
, shared the details of the investment at the
Bihar Business Connect 2024
summit. He highlighted a major project in the energy sector, stating, “We are exploring investment avenues in Bihar's energy sector. Our plan is to invest around Rs 20,000 crore to set up an ultra-super critical thermal power plant.""
Though Adani did not provide specific details about the plant's capacity or location, ultra-supercritical plants typically generate 1,980 megawatts using coal to produce electricity. This investment is expected to help address Bihar's energy deficit, which currently stands at around 1,600 MW, with peak demand exceeding the state's available generation capacity of 6,400 MW. The new plant is also expected to supply power to neighboring states.
The project is anticipated to create substantial job opportunities. ""We expect such a massive project to open up at least 12,000 job vacancies in the pre-commissioning phase and also lead to around 1,500 skilled jobs during the operational phase,"" said Pranav Adani.

In addition to the thermal power plant, the group plans to invest Rs 2,300 crore to expand its presence in sectors like warehousing, logistics, and clean energy. “This investment will not only massively increase our warehousing and handling capacity but also expand our presence in the EV, City Gas Distribution (CGD), and Compressed Biogas (CBG) space, generating an additional 27,000 direct and indirect local job opportunities,” Adani noted.
The company is also eyeing further investment in strategic infrastructure in Bihar, with a potential Rs 1,000 crore to be spent on projects like Gati Shakti Railway Terminals, Inland Container Depots (ICDs), and Industrial Warehousing Parks.
Another significant part of Adani's strategy in Bihar is the development of smart meter manufacturing. ""As Bihar migrates from conventional electric meters to smart meters, we will invest Rs 2,100 crore to manufacture and install over 28 lakh smart meters to automate power-consumption monitoring in five cities—Siwan, Gopalganj, Vaishali, Saran, and Samastipur. This will generate at least 4,000 local jobs in this technology segment,"" said Pranav Adani.
Additionally, the group's cement plants in Bihar will be expanded with a Rs 2,500 crore investment, aiming to increase production capacity to 10 million tonnes per annum.
This multi-sector investment underscores the Adani Group’s commitment to strengthening its footprint in Bihar and contributing to the state’s economic growth through job creation, infrastructure development, and technological advancements.

"SECI defends transfer of 2,333 mw power project from Azure to Adani",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/seci-defends-transfer-of-2333-mw-power-project-from-azure-to-adani/articleshow/116447043.cms,19-12-2024,"New Delhi: Even as the
Chandrababu Naidu
government continues to debate the fate of the controversial solar power deal, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (
SECI
) has defended the ""transfer"" of the
2,333 mw power project
from
Azure to Adani Group
before the apex power regulator, citing Andhra Pradesh's power requirement and unchanged terms and conditions of the contract, ET has learnt.
In a December 7, 2024 submission to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), SECI stated that ""Andhra Pradesh had sought for such supply and SECI could finalise the generation and supply of such quantum by
Adani Group
on the same terms and conditions"".
It underlined that the transfer to Adani Group did not affect ""the essential terms"" on which the regulatory approval was given for the overall Andhra power project by the CERC on April 2, 2022.
""The additional allocation made to Adani Group companies is within the quantum for which e-reverse auction was held and parties were selected, and the quantum of 9,234 mw was approved by the commission,"" SECI added.
It further pointed out that it had ""not deviated from the tariff adopted and approved by the commission"" in the transfer process.
Live Events
In a October 28, 2024 hearing, the CERC sought to know whether the substitution of power developer, from Azure to Adani, on account of the surrender of the 2,333 mw by Azure, was permissible under the tender document issued by SECI.
SECI, in its response to CERC, held that there was ""no prohibition in the guidelines of the bidding documents"" against the process adopted by it and cited Supreme Court orders that upheld the principle, according to it. ""This is consistent with the legal position on competitive bidding process and the powers of the tenderers decided by the Supreme Court,"" in several cases, SECI submitted.
The corporation held that it acted ""within the power of the person initiating the competitive bidding process and inviting bids to allocate power of 2,333 mw to Adani Group upon
Azure Power
not implementing the project"".
SECI stated that the objective of floating the original tender was to ""maximise solar power generation"" and the bidding process culminated in the decision to procure 12,000 mw for the onward supply as per the need of the state utilities. It was, however, faced with an unforeseen situation ""upon Azure Power not implementing the project"".
""When Azure Power did not proceed to implement the project, state of Andhra Pradesh had required the quantum of power of 2,333 mw. SECI thus considered it prudent to allocate the quantum to Adani Group on the same terms and conditions so that Andhra Pradesh will have the availability of full quantum of 7,000 mw power they had intended to procure"", the SECI told CERC.

imported coal
to use cheaper domestic supplies to help reduce electricity costs while lowering the dependence on overseas sources, said people aware of the matter.
India has 15 power plants that use imported coal, including
Tata Power
’s Coastal Power Gujarat,
Adani Power
Mundra Ltd, Essar Power Gujarat, and JSW Ratnagiri.
A reduction in coal imports will enhance energy security as well. The matter was discussed at a meeting between senior officials of the coal and power ministries this week, said the people cited above.
The domestic availability and cost of high-grade coal, the impact on the cost of generation, and the readiness of such plants to change fuel are some of the issues being thrashed out, said one of the persons.
Live Events
More meetings on the subject may be held after detailed studies, the person added.
“Some assessments have been made and more talks are likely to happen on the landed cost of the fuel and the requirement of retrofitting of equipment to suit domestic fuel at these plants,” the person said.
The total imported coal-based capacity is about 17 GW.
Energy charge rate
Rough industry estimates suggest the current energy charge rate, excluding fixed cost, is about `4.1-5.6 per unit for the imported coal-based plants.
In the case of domestic coal-based plants, the total tariff, including fixed cost, could range from `2.5 to `5.5 a unit depending on fuel transportation costs.
The coal ministry has already begun work on its plan to end
thermal coal imports
by FY26.

The minister said after the payment of 29 EMIs by the distribution utilities, including pre-payment of legacy dues by some utilities, the outstanding dues have reduced to Rs 24,684 crore as of December 6, 2024.
The discoms have paid Rs 1,15,263 crore outstanding since June 2022, he added.
In another reply, Naik said that the
Ministry of Power
, in consultation with states, has envisaged a plan to add thermal capacity of a minimum 80,000 MW by 2031-32.
Against this target, 29,200 MW thermal capacity is already under construction while 51,520 MW is at various stages of planning & development, he stated.

India to triple atomic power capacity by 2031,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-to-triple-atomic-power-capacity-by-2031/articleshow/116207405.cms,11-12-2024,"India's atomic power capacity has almost doubled in the past decade from 4,780 megawatts to 8,081 megawatts and it would be tripled by 2031,
Union Minister Jitendra Singh
said on Wednesday. Responding to a question in the Lok Sabha, Singh who holds key portfolios in the Prime Minister's Office, including the Department of Atomic Energy and the Department of Space, emphasised the transformative strides made since 2014.
""When this government came into power, the total power generation capacity was 4,780 megawatts. Today, in 2024, it stands at 8,081 megawatts. This means that the capacity developed in the last 10 years equals what was achieved over the previous 60 years,"" he said.
Singh projected that by 2031-32, the generation capacity would triple, reaching 22,480 megawatts.
The minister attributed this progress not only to technical expertise but to a shift in political will.
""We always had the talent and capacity, but what was missing, perhaps, was the enabling milieu provided by political leadership,"" he said.
Live Events
Responding to questions about power-sharing arrangements and project delays in Tamil Nadu, Singh noted that the formula for electricity distribution had been revised to ensure fairness.
""Currently, 50 per cent of electricity is allocated to the home state, 35 per cent to neighbouring states, and 15 per cent to the national grid. This formula aligns with the federal spirit,"" he said.
Singh acknowledged that one project in Tirunelveli remains on hold, contributing to delays in capacity expansion in the state. However, he highlighted the success of Kundankulam, which now has four operational units, and Kalpakkam, both of which gained momentum post-2014.
Singh also highlighted the peaceful applications of atomic energy, as envisioned by Homi Bhabha.
He noted the role of atomic energy in agriculture, producing 70 mutagenic crop varieties, and healthcare, where isotopes developed through atomic processes are used in cancer treatment.
""India is among the global leaders in leveraging atomic energy for peaceful and innovative purposes,"" he noted.
On India's thorium reserves, Singh said the country possesses 21 per cent of the world's supply.
""Monazite, a beach mineral, is the primary source of thorium. Past issues of pilferage have been addressed, and we are advancing towards utilising this resource,"" he said.
Singh added that the indigenous Bhavini project is experimenting with thorium usage, which will reduce dependence on uranium and other imported materials.

Adani seeks fresh lifeline for troubled East India Power Plant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-seeks-fresh-lifeline-for-troubled-east-india-power-plant/articleshow/116161523.cms,10-12-2024,"Adani Power Ltd
. is seeking fresh concessions from New Delhi for its $2 billion coal-fired plant in eastern India, which is currently struggling with a payments backlog from Bangladesh, the only buyer of its electricity.
In August, India’s power ministry allowed Adani to sell electricity from the plant into India, but its location in a designated special economic zone, or SEZ, is hampering those domestic sales, people familiar with the matter said. Unless the trade ministry grants an exemption, they said, the power produced would be considered imported — and subject to a tax.

As part of that request, the company is also asking to keep a waiver on customs duty applied to the imported coal that it uses to fire the 1.6-gigawatt facility, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are not public.
Without these concessions, the power becomes effectively impossible to sell to India’s price-sensitive consumers.

ALSO READ: Bangladesh asks Adani to reduce power supply citing low demand
The Adani plant, which accounts for about a 10th of Bangladesh’s power consumption, has already racked up as much as $790 million of dues as of the end of September, Adani executives said on an analyst call in October, though some payments from Bangladesh have begun to come through.
“We hope that there will be no further deterioration in terms of the outstandings and, as of now, we don’t think that we need to look at that option, but if required, we can consider it,” Nishit Dave, the company’s head of investor relations, said on the call in response to a question on whether Adani plans to link the plant to the Indian grid. “We will explore options.”
ALSO READ: Govt allows Adani Krishnapatnam Port to import petroleum into India by sea in 'public interest’
The payments owed by Bangladesh — originally the market for electricity from the plant — have accumulated amid efforts to review the power-purchase agreement signed under Dhaka’s previous government, ousted earlier this year following accusations of widespread corruption.
Trouble at the plant adds to ongoing headaches for the Adani Group, whose top officials were indicted by US prosecutors last month over an alleged bribery scheme worth more than $250 million. Adani has denied the US allegations and said it would seek legal recourse to defend itself.
Other companies have already flagged the risk with India’s SEZ regulation. In 2020, when India began finalizing the import taxes on solar cells and modules, more than 60% of its locally-produced modules came from these export promotion zones. After the government said it would levy a 40% import tax on panels and 25% on cells, local firms said this would make their modules costlier in the domestic market and lobbied the government for relief.
Since then, some producers have built capacity in areas outside these clusters.

"Amid solar power row, centre plans to review bidding process",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/amid-solar-power-row-centre-plans-to-review-bidding-process/articleshow/116112632.cms,09-12-2024,"Amid the controversy over the Adani-Azure solar power deal, the Centre is holding deliberations to review and reassess the current bidding approach for renewable energy projects used by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
A possible policy shift - from a Centre-driven bidding process to a state government-led one - is being mulled, ET has learnt.
It is gathered that there is a clear view emerging that the Centre and SECI may shift gears and avoid suo moto initiation of large scale power tenders, as has been the case so far. Instead, bids may be floated only after states indicate their requirement of solar/renewable energy power.
SECI currently takes a 'pro-active' approach, floating tenders for power procurement, buying power from developers at 'discovered' or fixed tariffs, and subsequently selling it to interested state governments and distribution companies (Discoms) through Power Purchase and Supply Agreements (PPAs and PSAs).
However, recent discussions between the power ministry, MNRE and SECI in the aftermath of the Andhra Pradesh solar power project controversy have thrown up suggestions to let RE power projects be driven by state governments instead.

This would help avoid a scenario where inking PSAs later becomes a challenge for SECI as was the case with the 7000MW tender of 2020 which has now landed in courts, both in Andhra Pradesh as well as the US. There is, however, a disadvantage to such an approach - an issue which was red flagged during the meetings.
SECI, the key RE trader in India, currently takes the lead and nudges states on spreading the RE footprint across the country. Since it plays the central intermediary on agreements with the private sector and ensures their payment security, SECI tenders usually draw good participation and hence lower tariffs as well which benefits states.
This Centre-driven approach is also key to India meeting its 500 GW RE target by 2030, as also committed by India in its Nationally Determined Targets (NDCs) at global fora like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
In a scenario where India's RE expansion will not be SECI-driven, attaining the RE goals could become challenging and may eventually cause a slowdown in the sector, besides stifling the growing new industry, it is felt.
Meanwhile, even as the Andhra Pradesh government discusses various options on the contentious 7000 MW power deal with the Adani Group, it is yet to reach out to SECI on the matter.
At its end, ET gathers, SECI has not found evidence of wrongdoing in its own tendering process for the AP project.
Several government insiders, however, admit that the design of the 2020-21 manufacturing linked power tender itself was a faulty one in combining two different objectives in a single bid.
Following the 7000MW experience, SECI made a course correction and did not issue any further major manufacturing-linked tenders. It has since moved to issuing smaller tenders of 1500MW-2000MW, they added.

"YSRCP government rejected AP power officials concerns on high tariff, delays",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/state-govt-rejected-ap-power-officials-concerns-over-tariff/articleshow/116083810.cms,08-12-2024,"Andhra Pradesh Power Coordination Committee
(APPCC), the lead power procurer for state’s power distribution companies, had flagged high tariff and expected delays in 7000 MW solar power project and sought a sweeter deal for the state but these were steamrolled.
A detailed report on procurement of solar power under SECI’s manufacturing-linked solar scheme, sent to Andhra Pradesh energy secretary by APPCC and accessed by ET, shows that concerns were raised before the signing of power supply agreement with Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI). However, these concerns were rejected and state government went ahead with the deal offered. One of the concerns was on tariff of Rs 2.49 per unit offered by
Adani Green Energy Limited
(AGEL) and
Azure Power India Private Limited
(APIPL).
According to the report, APPCC had said, “Since the projects are outside the state, the tariff should be inclusive of basic customs duty as stipulated by the Government of India and trading margin of SECI…” APPCC had also suggested that SECI should re-negotiate tariff of tranches that would come in September 2025 and 2026 as per the prices prevalent then. These suggestions were rejected by the state government.
As the present N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP government is poring over the documents related to the controversial solar power project, it has found that the tariff does not include basic customs duty, GST and transmission losses. The tariff could well turn out to be Rs 3.80 per unit. With solar power prices down, if Andhra Pradesh were to buy power today, it would be between Rs 2.56 and 2.6 per unit (all inclusive).
APPCC had also expected project delays and had suggested that state should not be deprived of the promised power and SECI should supply power from any other project. APPCC had said, “There is every possibility of delays in commissioning of these projects. It is only appropriate that SECI, being a solar power generation incubating agency with a long pipeline, mitigate the delay risks on its PSAs.

Accordingly, in case of delays on any tranche, consider negotiating a condition that SECI substitute that tranche with any PSA entered by it subsequent to that tranche and which becomes operational before the delayed tranche.” However, SECI had raised objections to this saying, “SECI have already concluded 12000 MW binds under manufacturing linked tender. Substitution of any phase is not possible under this tender. However, tariff reduction, if any, imposed on SPDs if any, due to late commissioning shall be passed onto the procurers as per PSA terms.” The project is running into delays. As per the set timelines Andhra Pradesh was supposed to get 3000 MW in September 2024, 3000 in September 2025 and 1000 in September 2026. However, as per a response given to ET’s queries by AGEL now the first tranche will come in April 2025 and that too 1000 MW. If Andhra Pradesh would have insisted on APPCC’s consideration it would have got power from another

CFM Asset Reconstruction Pvt Ltd
has dragged
Vidarbha Industries Power Ltd
(VIPL) to the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT) over unpaid dues of nearly ₹3,800 crore.
CFM ARC filed an insolvency petition under Section 7 of the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
(IBC) in the
Mumbai bench of NCLT
. Admitting the petition, the bench appointed Bimal Kumar Agarwal as the interim resolution professional (IRP) to oversee the insolvency process, including managing VIPL's assets and inviting resolution plans. The RP admitted ₹4,954 crore claims from secured financial creditors.
CFM ARC, being the sole lender, will decide on the fate of VIPL. This would include selling the company to a new buyer, restructuring the debt or liquidating the company.
VIPL, a special purpose vehicle was set up by
Reliance Power
for building a coal-based thermal power plant comprising two units of 300 MW each at Butibori at Nagpur in Maharashtra. The project was awarded after an international bidding process run by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, and it was eventually converted into an independent power project.
The Butibori project has a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Maharashtra for 3085 MW, with potential for expansion.

VIPL defaulted on loans totalling ₹3,872 crore to
Axis Bank
and
State Bank of India
(SBI), leading to classification of its account as a
non-performing asset
in 2019. The plant is shuttered since 2019, according to the NCLT petition.
Both lenders later sold their debts to CFM ARC in 2023 as reported by ET in October 2023.
This September,
Reliance Power
announced that its entire obligation as a guarantor on behalf of VIPL has been settled resulting in the release and discharge of corporate guarantee, undertakings, and all obligations and claims thereunder concerning the outstanding debt of VIPL totalling ₹3872.04 crore. Consequently, the entire 100% shareholding of VIPL were pledged in favour of CFM.

The projected electrical energy requirement and peak electricity demand on all-India basis is estimated as 1908 BU (billion units) and 277 GW, respectively for 2026-27.
The projections were made during a Meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee of Members of Parliament for
Ministry of Power
here last evening.
Union Power Minister Manohar Lal
chaired the meeting.
As per 20th Electric Power Survey (EPS) report published by the
Central Electricity Authority
(CEA), the peak demand and energy requirement is pegged at around 366 GW and 2474 BU by 2031-32, it stated.
Energy Storage capacity is an important aspect in achieving the targets of NEP. Energy storage capacity of 16.13 GW/82.37 GWh with PSP(pumped storage) based storage of 7.45 GW capacity and 47.65 GWh storage and BESS based storage of 8.68 GW/34.72 GWh is required by 2026-27.
The projections of total capacity addition are in line with the target of the country to achieve a non-fossil based installed capacity of 500 GW by 2029-30, it stated.

The ministry said that the total fund requirement for the period 2022-2027 is estimated to be Rs 14,54,188 crore, which also includes the likely expenditure during 2022-27 for advance action for the projects expected to get commissioned during 2027-32, it stated.
The average emission factor is expected to reduce to 0.548 kg CO2/kWh in the year 2026-27 and to 0.430 kg CO2/kWh by the end of 2031-32, it stated.
The share of non-fossil-based capacity is likely to increase to 57.4 per cent by the end of 2026-27 and may further increase to 68.4 per cent by the end of 2031-32 from around 46.5 per cent as on October 2024, it stated.
Members of Parliament provided several suggestions concerning various initiatives and schemes. They commended the plan for its ambitious green energy goals and achievements in electricity generation capacity.
The meeting also included discussions on issues related to storage, renewable energy generation, and compensation for farmers.
He further directed officials to take appropriate actions to incorporate the suggestions made by Members of Parliament and prioritize the welfare of the people.
Emphasizing India's commitment to achieving carbon net-zero, he stated that the focus would remain on non-fossil-based energy sources.
The Union Minister also stressed the importance of enhancing storage capacity to ensure affordable and reliable power for everyone.
He also emphasised that state and central governments need to work in coordination to achieve the targets. Minister of State for Power Shripad Yesso Naik said that India is energy transition as per the NDCs and is on path of achieving SDGs .
He said that the National Electricity Plan (NEP) is a short-term framework of five years while giving a 15-year perspective.
The fourth NEP prepared by Central Electricity Authority includes a review of the period 2017 -22, detailed capacity addition requirement during the years 2022-27 and Perspective Plan projections for the years 2027 -32.
Installed generation capacity as on October 31, 2024 was 454.5 GW comprising of 243.1 GW thermal, 8.2 GW Nuclear, 203.2GW Renewables including large hydro of 46.97 GW.
The peak demand has grown at a CAGR of 16 per cent from 2013-14 to 2023-24 while energy requirement has grown at a rate of 5 per cent during 2013-14 to 2023-24.
The peak not met and energy not supplied is very minimal over last five years and was on account of factors other than lack of generation capacity in the country.

Delhi High Court seeks response from Centre on Tata Power's challenge to Coal ministry order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhi-high-court-seeks-response-from-centre-on-tata-powers-challenge-to-coal-ministry-order/articleshow/115905871.cms,02-12-2024,"The
Delhi High Court
has sought response from the Central government and others on a petition by
Tata Power Company
(TPC) challenging the
coal ministry
’s nominated authority’s order that reduced compensation payable to the company in a matter arising from the deallocation of the
Mandakini Coal Block
in Odisha.
The HC also asked the ministry and others to maintain status quo with regard to the compensation order till December 4, the next date of hearing.
The nominated Authority's in its revised final compensation order had reduced the compensation payable to it, amongst others, for the deallocation of the Mandakini Coal Block at the instance of Karnataka Power Corporation (KPCL), the new allottee of the coal block, and
IFCI Ltd
, a “secured creditor”, according to TPC. It further said that such revision of the final compensation orders of April 2020 and August 2021 is “arbitrary”, “was wholly without jurisdiction” and passed without due application of mind.
Tata Power said the nominated authority, a statutory authority under the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, had reduced the land compensation to be paid to the prior allottees from Rs 182.52 crore to Rs 114.91 crore on the grounds that there was a lack of clarity in the definition of prior allottee.
Challenging the authority's order, TPC told the HC that it along with
Jindal Photo
(JPL) and Monnet Ispat & Energy (MIEL) have been mentioned as the prior allottees of the Mandakini Coal Block. However, the authority had erroneously considered IFCI Ltd as a secured creditor of the prior allottees, it said, adding the authority had erred in awarding Rs 102.47 crore to the lender in its revised compensation order without appreciating that the latter had not challenged the final compensation order and same had attained finality, TPC said.

TPC was one of the prior allottees of the ‘Mandakini Coal Block along with JPL and (MIEL). For the allotment, the prior allottees in March 2008 had formed Mandakini Coal Company Ltd (MCCL) as a special purpose vehicle to operate and manage the coal block. Each of the prior allottees had an equal shareholding of 33.33% in MCCL. While land was acquired by MCCL, no mining lease had been executed for the coal block.
In May 2014, MCCL took a Rs 140 crore term loan IFCI and each prior allottee provided a corporate guarantee to the extent of 1/3rd of the loan amount. Pursuant to the Supreme Court quashing the allotment of coal blocks including the Mandakini in 2014, IFCI called for mandatory pre-payment of the outstanding loan on or before May 2015.
Further, IFCI filed its claim of around Rs 142.92 crore before the nominated authority of the ministry under Section 9 of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Second Ordinance, 2014 (later replaced by the Act, 2015), as a “secured creditor” of MCCL for receiving the compensation for cancellation. It also invoked the corporate guarantees of all the three companies.
As TPC and JPL fully discharged their liabilities, IFCI reduced its claim before the nominated authority to Rs 54.36 crore being the remaining amount payable by MIEL, which subsequently went into insolvency. IFCI then filed its claim before the resolution professional and settled its claim in 2018.
“However, till date, the nominated authority has failed to disburse the compensation to the Petitioner (TPC),” the petition stated. The appeal filed by MCCL, on behalf of the prior allottee seeking enhancement of the compensation before the coal tribunal under the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957 at Talcher is still pending. Neither KPCL nor IFCI filed any plea against the final compensation order till date.

Bangladesh asks Adani to reduce power supply citing low demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bangladesh-halves-power-buying-from-adani-amid-payment-dispute/articleshow/115900004.cms,02-12-2024,"Mumbai: Bangladesh, which owes
Adani Power
$844 million (Rs 7,000 crore) in power dues, has asked the company to nearly halve its electricity supplies due to limited demand during winter.
""Due to low demand owing to the onset of winter, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has conveyed that we need to supply from one unit only,"" a spokesperson for Adani Power told ET in an emailed response to queries, adding that the units are available as per the contract with BPDB.
The spokesperson said also that Adani Power has no indication from the Bangladesh government so far about a potential review of the power purchase agreement.
The company signed the 25-year power purchase deal with BPDB in 2015. Adani Power meets a tenth of Bangladesh's electricity needs.
The company supplies nearly 1600 MW of power to Bangladesh from its coal-fired plant in Godda, Jharkhand. It has two units of nearly 800 MW each.

Of the dues outstandings of $844 million, BPDB paid $91 million and $103 million in October and November, respectively.
""For the power supplied till 31st October and payment received till 30th November, the current outstanding amount is $844 million. November invoice has not been raised yet,"" the Adani Power spokesperson said.
Bangladesh is facing a challenge in generating dollar revenues and using it to pay for imported electricity and oil.
On November 7, BPDB issued a fresh letter of credit (LC) worth $173 million to Adani Power for continuous power supply by the latter. The move came after Adani Power, in October, cut electricity supplies by half, over unpaid dues. Adani Power had sought an additional payment of $15-20 million from BPDB to resume supplies.
""Like any Genco, we remain guided by BPDB's power schedule, and as per that, currently one unit is supplying power, meeting the demand,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the company has not got any indication from the Bangladesh government so far about reviewing the power purchase pact.
""It's a seven-year-old agreement. Also, we remain competitive as compared to other imported coal, gas and oil-based stations, despite protagonists making statements without reference to facts,"" the spokesperson said.
Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani had this September written to Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser to the Bangladesh government, seeking his intervention in the early liquidation of nearly $850 million of receivables to the power producer.
Adani's letter stated that the company had invested $2 billion in building the plant and associated transmission infrastructure and delivered it in a record time of 3.5 years despite being impacted by three waves of Covid-19.

The highest supply in a day (
peak power demand

The peak power demand touched an all-time high of about 250 GW in May this year. The previous all-time high peak power demand of 243.27 GW was recorded in September 2023.
Earlier this year, the
power ministry
projected a peak power demand of 235 GW during the day and 225 GW during evening hours for May while 240 GW during daytime and 235 GW in the evening hours for June.
The ministry had also estimated that peak power demand may hit 260 GW this summer.
Live Events
Noting that November 2024 was the warmest in last four to five years as per official data, the experts opined that power demand as well as consumption showed subdued growth mainly due to slow onset of winters.
They further said that marginal rise in peak power demand in November also shows the effect of warmer-than-normal month, especially in Northern India where consumption of electricity rises due to use of heaters and geysers in winter due to dip in mercury.
However, they said that the demand for power and consumption will continue to be steady in the coming days due to good commercial and industrial activities as well as dip in the temperature.

Adani Power has also pledged to continue supplying electricity to Bangladesh despite escalating payment dues, which the company warns are creating significant operational challenges.
“Bangladesh's dues are of significant concern and rendering plant operations unsustainable,” the representative has said.
Adani Power has been supplying electricity to Bangladesh under a long-term agreement signed in 2017 by Adani and a government entity under now ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Using expensive imported coal, supply from the 1,600 megawatt plant started in 2023 and meets about a tenth of Bangladesh's power consumption.
Adani Power is seeking to recover over $800 million in outstanding dues from Bangladesh. The company has reduced its power supply from 1,400-1,500 MW in early August to 700-750 MW currently.
“We are confident Bangladesh will fulfill their commitments, just as we have diligently upheld our contractual obligations,” the spokesperson added.
Bangladesh’s interim government is investigating the Adani power deal alongside six other contracts to ensure findings are credible for international negotiations and arbitration, according to a government statement cited by Reuters.
Adani charged Bangladesh 14.02 taka per unit for Indian-generated power in the 2022/23 fiscal year, the highest rate compared to an average of 8.77 taka per unit, as per the Bangladesh Power Development Board. While the rate dropped to 12 taka in 2023/24, it remains 27% higher than prices from India’s other private producers and up to 63% more than rates from Indian state-owned plants, Reuters reported.

India to provide powerplant control centre to South African electricity supplier Eskom,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-to-provide-powerplant-control-centre-to-south-african-electricity-supplier-eskom/articleshow/115827336.cms,30-11-2024,"India will provide South African parastatal electricity supplier
Eskom
with a Powerplant Control Room simulator to train locals in Eskom's plans to renew and repurpose its power stations across the country, an official has said. The announcement was made on Friday after representatives of a dozen Indian energy companies met Eskom executives on the sidelines of the Urja Matla Energy Conference.
The conference was hosted by the Indian Consulate General and the Wits Business School.
Harish Kumar, Commercial Representative and Head of Chancery at the Indian Consulate in Johannesburg, said at the meeting that India was ready to help Eskom in renovation and modernisation, equipping them with efficient systems through supercritical and ultra supercritical sets, emission control, and latest technologies in transmission and distribution.
""Also, we would be willing to provide a simulator of Powerplant Control Room to train the local manpower of Eskom in the operation of power plants. This simulator can be housed in Wits Business School, where the National Power Training Institute (NPTI)and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) will train the trainers, which is as per the MoU inked between
NTPC
and Eskom,"" Kumar said.
He added that the housing would be done as soon as Eskom confirmed the required rating of the
Powerplant Simulator
. The consulate earlier helped facilitate an MoU signed between
NTPC
and Eskom.

Radhakrishnan Sarangapani, Executive Director at NTPC, explained what the MoU entails.
""We started negotiations when the original Eskom team visited our plant. When they came back, they also implemented practices and decided that we should carry these practices forward with a framework of an agreement.
""The idea is mutual cooperation and helping South African plants increase their efficiency through the expertise of NTPC. South Africa also has expertise about the equipment they have at their power plants which could also be useful to NTPC also,"" Sarangapani said.
He added that NTPC has a bouquet of services which could definitely be under the terms of this MoU.
The NTCP team visited a plant of Eskom before returning to India to decide on the specific areas of cooperation.
""The elements of the MoU are basically to set up mutual cooperation with the power plants of Eskom in the areas of renovation and modernisation of the plants in terms of services. Also, there will be joint collaboration on renewable energy,"" Eskom CEO Dan Marokane told PTI.
""NTPC and Eskom are both state utilities with vast, big, many years of operational experience. We can learn between the two of us and what we've got to do is collaborate to improve our performances as a utility,"" Marokane said.
He also said that the global shift away from
coal-fired power stations
was also an issue that the two countries would address together.
""Reducing emissions is a responsible thing to do, but we want to explore technologies for allowing us to use coal for longer in a responsible manner. India has also been running coal operations for many years and I think if we come together, we can really make some magic in terms of performance on both sides,"" Marokane said.
Earlier at the conference, NPTI and the Africa Energy Leadership Centre at the Wits Business School agreed to ink an MoU for cooperation to augment skilling of youth in the power sector, focusing on renewable energy, data analytics, transmission and distribution.
Eskom's medium-term plans to involve the communities around the power stations in a variety of
green energy projects
, including agriculture, and producing bricks from the mountains of ash that are waste products at the coal-fired stations.

Adani can bill Andhra Pradesh ₹850 crore more for power at the heart of bribery charges,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/now-solar-power-to-cost-andhra-pradesh-more/articleshow/115819343.cms,30-11-2024,"The power to be supplied to Andhra Pradesh from the Gujarat-based solar power project, which is at the heart of the bribery charges against billionaire Gautam Adani, will not come as cheap as ₹2.49 per kWh. Documents show that a basic customs duty levied on solar panels and solar cells will be passed on to Andhra Pradesh which will push up the power tariff by over 50 paise and mean an additional annual burden of ₹850 crore.
Andhra Pradesh would pay this amount over and above the Rs 2.49 per kWh for 7,000 MW of solar power from
Adani Green Energy Limited
(AGEL) project. This could mean an effective tariff of ₹3.069 per kWh. In 2021,
Andhra Pradesh Power Coordination Committee
(APPCC) chairman had submitted a report to secretary (energy) of the state government on ""Procurement of solar power under SECI's (Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited) manufacturing-linked solar scheme"".
Annexures of the report, exclusively accessed by ET, reveal that the tariff offered does not include the basic custom duty levied on solar panels and solar cells, which became effective from April 2022. The annexure says, ""A basic custom duty will be imposed on this project as it will be commissioned after April 2022 realistically. During discussions held with CMD, APGECL (Andhra Pradesh Green Energy Corporation Limited), the expected impact due to BCD (basic custom duty) is expected to be ₹0.429/kWh... Tariff may increase accordingly. Expected impact due to GST is ₹0.12-0.15/kWh."" If these values (which may vary now) are simply added, this would mean a tariff of ₹3.069 per kWh. If the state were to purchase power now, it can get an all-inclusive tariff of ₹2.50 per kWh. The project has been under scrutiny following US indictment of Adani over alleged bribery charges. The US Justice Department has claimed that an unnamed Andhra official, who was in office from 2019 to June 2024, was offered kickbacks to the tune of ₹1,750 crore, aimed at facilitating state distribution companies to buy solar power from SECI. Former chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday rejected these charges and said the agreements entered into were a step ""towards wealth creation"".
""SECI offered to supply power at ₹2.49 per unit. Also, there is a waiver of the inter-state transmission system (ISTS). The government will save more than 1 lakh crore in the next 25 years in addition to the ISTS waiver of about ₹4,440 crore,"" said Reddy. In 2019, SECI had signed a power purchase agreement with AGEL to supply solar power.
In December 2021, Andhra Pradesh signed a power supply agreement (PSA) with SECI for 7,000 MW of power from AGEL. Till then, the government had not notified a 40% customs duty on import of solar panels. The duty became effective from April 1, 2022. This is why SECI informed the Andhra Pradesh government, which agreed, that this duty will be passed onto the state.

"Azure group cited TDP PILs, SECI termed exit a 'breach'",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/azure-group-cited-tdp-pils-seci-termed-exit-a-breach/articleshow/115818304.cms,02-12-2024,"At the centre of the US indictment of the Adani-Azure Power groups (US subsidiary) is the latter suddenly exiting the
Andhra Pradesh Power project
citing the
public interest litigations
(PILs) filed against it by CPI secretary K Ramakrishna in 2021 and TDP leader Payyavula Keshav in 2022. The US indictment also hints at
Azure group
'secretly influencing' the Solar Energy Corporation of India (
SECI
) for the same.
ET gathers, however, that SECI strongly contested
Azure Power
's PIL argument and shot off nearly half a dozen communication to them to desist from exiting the 2,333 MW power agreement. In a four-page communication to the group on March 18, 2024, SECI underlined that the filing of the December 9, 2021 PIL was ""well communicated"" to them, ""prior to the execution of the PPAs"" (December 16, 2021).
Despite the pendency of the PIL, Azure is learnt to have expressed its ""willingness to proceed with execution of PPAs and Projects"" with AP discoms and had submitted a letter stating the same on December 15, 2021.
SECI noted that at no point had the Andhra HC 'stayed the implementation of the project by Azure Power or by Adani Renewable.Azure Group's December 7, 2022 communication to SECI led to the unravelling of the 2,333 MW project. In the letter, Azure Power sought early termination of the agreement citing the long pendency of the PIL in court, implications of its outcome for the tariff conditionally approved and how the pending litigation caused 'regulatory uncertainty' that made it difficult for it to get
debt finance
from lenders.

SECI Vs Azure
It is learnt that SECI held meetings with Azure group after its December 7, 2022 communication and sent at least half a dozen letters to the group from December 2022 to April 2024, to persuade them not to exit the project. It termed Azure's move as one against 'public interest' and an attempt 'to wriggle out of obligations' of the PPA to boost renewable power.
Azure did not inform SECI of the ongoing US SEC investigations regarding the project at any point during these meetings and exchange of letters, it is gathered. Sources claimed that the terminated 2,333 MW project was later awarded to
Adani Group
to prevent project collapse and delays that would arise in case of cancellation and re-tendering.
With Azure group not budging, on March 18, 2024, SECI wrote to the group agreeing to terminate the PPA at its behest but termed it a 'material breach' of its performance obligation and said that the group was 'liable to compensate for such breach'. Azure Power's decision ""not to implement the project will result in irreparable loss and injury to AP discoms, consumers in Andhra Pradesh and is also against public interest"", the SECI added. It also conveyed that it had the right to take ""appropriate action"" against Azure Power, subject to final outcome of the writ petition in the AP High Court, and all such action will be at the ""cost and risk of Azure Power"". SECI underlined the ""importance of the proposed solar power for the buying entity"" and questioned its decision to surrender the connectivity to POWERGRID/CTUIL for the ISTS.The letter took note of Azure's sudden writ petition on October 16, 2023, in the AP High Court seeking a direction to SECI to allow it to exit the AP project and return 14 performance guarantees worth ₹116.65 crore.
SECI, which filed a counter affidavit on November 18, 2023, noted that the petition was filed by Azure Power at the time when commissioning of power projects of 2333MW capacity was to be progressively undertaken commencing November 2024. ""The purported attempt by Azure Power to wriggle out of obligations of the PPA is defeating the entire purpose"" of entering into
power agreements
to provide renewable power for the Andhra Pradesh government scheme to serve its agricultural consumers, it stated.
Azure's 700 MW Withdrawal Plan
Another letter followed on April 25, 2024, on Azure revealing to its investors plans to withdraw from 700MW of the 4,000MW project inked with SECI in 2020. Taking note of Azure's annual financial statement dated March 31, 2024, SECI wrote of how these mention a group decision to also ""withdraw from the 700MW project which is part of the 4,000 MW manufacturing linked tender"" awarded by SECI to it in 2020.In a January 19, 2023 meeting with SECI, the Azure group maintained that it was still ""willing to set up a 4,000 MW Solar PV project"". SECI noted that such a statement by Azure Power now is 'highly surprising' as it comes ""without any substantial reason and that too post expiry of the original scheduled commissioning date of most of the projects"" covered under PPAs of Package 1.
It cautioned that all these projects were awarded to meet RE requirements of discoms which had a Renewable Purchase Obligation and failure to meet them would have a penal implication for them.

To ensure consistent power availability, BSES distribution companies are leveraging mechanisms like power banking, power exchange, and maintaining spinning reserves.
In case of an unexpected spike in demand, BSES will secure short-term power from the exchange.
Advanced load forecasting will also enhance reliability by ensuring demand is predicted with precision.
Tata Power-Delhi Distribution Ltd expects peak demand to breach the 1,840-MW mark in the areas it serves.
The company has made sufficient arrangements, including long-term power tie-ups, equipment maintenance for low temperatures and foggy conditions, and preventive and condition-based maintenance of electrical installations.
Reliable power supply hinges on accurate demand or load forecasting on multiple time scales, day-ahead, intra-day and medium term from a fortnight to one year outlook.
Key weather factors including temperature, rainfall, cloud cover, wind speed and humidity are integrated, along with variable factors like holidays and unexpected disruptions.

India's lessons in energy security applicable to Africa: Power Minister Khattar,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-lessons-in-energy-security-applicable-to-africa-power-minister-khattar/articleshow/115777176.cms,28-11-2024,"India's lessons in becoming self-sufficient in energy can be useful to other countries, Union Minister for Power Manohar Lal Khattar said on Thursday at the first energy conference here co-hosted by the Consulate General of India and the Wits Business School. Titled the 'Matla-Urja Energy Conference, ('matla' is Sesotho for 'strength' and 'urja' is energy in Hindi), over 200 delegates shared ideas for cooperative efforts in the energy sector.
""This marks a significant milestone as the first country-specific conference undertaken in South Africa, underscoring the strong partnership between India and South Africa,"" Khattar said via video link from India in his opening remarks.
""This conference reflects the growing cooperation between the two countries in the energy sector,"" he said.
""Access to reliable energy is a fundamental aspect of modern life, yet studies report that across Africa, around 600 million people still lack this essential service and access to energy remains a significant issue.
""While each country follows its unique path to achieve energy security, many of the lessons learned by India are broadly applicable. India has made significant progress in the last decade in achieving energy security and transitioning to green energy and lessons learned from this journey are universally relevant and applicable,"" Khattar said.

The minister said he was confident that the energy conference would provide a platform for Indian and South African participants to share knowledge, engage in meaningful discussions, identify areas for collaboration and explore mutual opportunities.
""Indian participants from both the public and private sectors bring valuable experience to the table. The Government of India is fully committed to supporting joint efforts in achieving universal energy access,"" Khattar concluded.
His South African counterpart, Minister of Electricity and Energy Kgosientso Ramokgopa, outlined the steps that had been taken after President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed him to address the massive electricity disruptions that last year saw areas of the country with power for only a few hours a day.
Ramokgopa said South Africa had now experienced 200 days without load-shedding, the longest period in many years after steps were taken to avoid a total blackout.
High Commissioner for India Prabhat Kumar explained how India had also been through a similar situation earlier but had triumphed over it to now being an exporter of power.
""We had blackouts and load-shedding. Only the major cities were exempted, but in the last ten years, we have overcome that. India became a single grid in December 2013. We had a slogan - 'One Nation, One Grid. That means that power can be generated anywhere and transmitted to any part of our country,"" Kumar said, adding that by 2019, every village and every household had electricity.
""With renewable power also now available, India has surplus power to export. It is not only able to meet its own needs but is also able to sell power to neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Nepal. We are also looking at underwater connectivity with Sri Lanka in the long run,"" Kumar said as he detailed India's plans for renewable energy, especially solar power, through partnerships with the private sector.
Turning to the global situation and its impact on India and South Africa, Kumar said oil and gas ""have always been political commodities"".
""This is also apparent in the relations between India and South Africa. We buy coal from (South Africa) in big quantities and we supply refined petroleum in big quantities because we have surpluses of refined petroleum,"" he said.
Kumar said India was looking towards Africa to secure supplies of minerals.
""Companies from India are ready to invest in minerals that are required for the new technologies of renewables like solar panels or wind hydrogen. We have had sessions with the governments (of both South Africa and India) and investors are ready to come to South Africa in this area,"" he said.
Kumar said India has already achieved a situation where 15 per cent of ethanol is blended with petrol, with a target of 20 per cent by next year.
""This not only saves money but also helps farmers and producers of ethanol. Sugar farmers especially are benefiting, and this is a lesson which can be brought to South Africa,"" he said.
The conference was preceded by a day-long academic conference in which leaders from both India and South Africa discussed options for an efficient energy mix, including the envisaged role of oil and gas in Just Energy Transition; energy modelling trends; and skills and capacity development for Just Energy Transition.

Adani Group's clarification on bribery charges:
Adani Group executives haven't been indicted on bribery charges by the US authorities, the conglomerate said on Wednesday, while adding that the action taken by the US authorities has led to ""significant repercussions including... international project cancellations, financial market impact and sudden examination from strategic partners, investors, and the public"".
The clarification on the bribery charge sparked a surge in Adani Group shares.
Adani Green Energy Ltd
said group founder chairman
Gautam Adani
, his nephew Sagar Adani, and senior executive Vneet Jaain have not been charged with violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) over bribery, nor is the civil complaint filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) based on this. Instead, they have been charged on three counts in the criminal indictment-alleged securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and securities fraud, the company said in the Adani Group statement that was issued on Wednesday.
The corruption matter only applies to Azure Power and CDPQ executives, according to the Adani Group.

Additionally, to ensure consistent power availability, BSES discoms are leveraging mechanisms like ""banking,"" ""power exchange,"" and maintaining ""spinning reserves."" If demand unexpectedly spikes, BSES is prepared to secure short-term power from the exchange. Advanced
load forecasting
will also enhance reliability by ensuring demand is predicted with precision.
In an effort to maximise efficiency, BSES discoms will bank surplus power with states in need of extra energy during the winter. This banked power will flow back to Delhi in the high-demand summer months. BRPL plans to bank up to 210 MW, while BYPL aims to bank up to 575 MW, supporting states like Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Kerala, which reciprocated with power support during Delhi's peak summer months.
The reliable power supply hinges on accurate demand (load) forecasting performed on multiple time scales: (i) (i) day-ahead in 96 time slots, (ii) intra-day, and (iii) medium-term (from a fortnight to a one-year outlook). Key weather factors, including temperature, rainfall, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and humidity, are integrated, along with variables like holidays and unexpected disruptions. BSES uses a combination of sophisticated advanced statistical forecasting models using complex algorithms, combined with state-of-the-art and artificial intelligence and machine learning tools for precise load forecasting.
""Domain expertise provided by IMD-POSCO further enhances this system, creating accurate forecasting models that save both time and costs.
This accurate day-ahead, intra-day, and medium-term demand forecasting is vital for optimal and cost-effective planning in ensuring reliable power supply to consumers at an optimal cost. BSES actively leverages the real-time market on the power exchange, which aids in balancing RE power and maintaining grid stability.

An NTPC official had earlier said that the company would not be involved anymore in the 1,400 MW Chutka Madhya Pradesh Atomic Power Project, which was also to be jointly developed with NPCIL.
Green ambitions
The company's targeted 60 GW renewable energy capacity by 2032 is being driven by its newly listed arm NTPC Green Energy Ltd. The target may be well achieved by 2030, the person said, adding the investment for the target for solar and wind projects capacity would be around Rs 3.25 lakh crore. The overall capital expenditure for its green projects till 2029-30 would be around Rs 5 lakh crore.
Of the 60 GW, 19 GW of renewable energy capacity is likely to be in place by 2026-27, at an investment of Rs 1 lakh crore, the person said.

PFC & REC see no impact on loans to Adani projects,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/pfc-rec-see-no-impact-on-loans-to-adani-projects/articleshow/115706662.cms,27-11-2024,"New Delhi: State-owned power sector lenders
Power Finance Corporation Ltd
(PFC) and
REC Ltd
do not see any immediate impact on their exposure to
Adani
Group projects, according to officials.
""Current projects are all ringfenced and 56% of the projects that we have lent to have already been commissioned,"" an official said, asking not to be named.
""Project financing depends on the revenue cash flow of the project so that none of the revenue cash flow is affected. [Adani Group's] payments are on time and loans are secured, so there is no concern,"" a second official said, adding that for loans extended to under-construction projects, Adani Group companies are making timely payments.
The comments track the indictment of Adani Group chairman and founder Gautam Adani and seven others by US authorities on November 21 for allegedly bribing government officials in India to obtain power supply agreements for a renewable energy project.
On extending fresh loans to new Adani projects, the officials said standard processes will be followed by the lenders, which include evaluating cash flow generation and equity investments.
Live Events
Asked about the risk factors for future projects of the conglomerate, the first official said the lenders are awaiting further clarity on the issue of indictment of the Adani officials. PFC declined to comment while
REC
did not respond to ET's email query.
Usually, projects are financed on merit and commercial viability, which are the top parameters for any lending activity, the second official said, adding the approach is applied consistently across all projects irrespective of the borrower profile. Moody's Ratings on Tuesday changed the outlook to 'negative' from 'stable' for Adani Green Energy, Adani Transmission, and Adani Ports.
Lenders have been active in funding green energy projects in India apart from conventional energy and infrastructure segments.
REC's loan disbursement in the first half of this fiscal rose 20% from a year earlier to ₹90,955 crore. Lending for renewable energy and hydro projects surged 93% during the period. PFC saw a 19% rise in disbursement in the same period at ₹66,146 crore.

"Andhra Pradesh mulls next steps on Adani, if power deal can be scrapped",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/andhra-pradesh-mulls-next-steps-on-adani-if-power-deal-can-be-scrapped/articleshow/115680055.cms,26-11-2024,"Andhra Pradesh
is reviewing government files and will explore if it is possible to cancel a power supply contract linked to the
Adani Group
, whose billionaire founder has been indicted in the United States, a top official told Reuters.
U.S. authorities have charged
Gautam Adani
and seven others with agreeing to pay bribes of $265 million to unnamed Indian government officials to obtain solar power-supply contracts in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, between 2021 and 2022.
Most of the alleged bribes - $228 million - were paid to a government official to get Andhra Pradesh's state electricity distribution companies to agree to purchase power, stated the U.S. indictment. Adani has said the allegations are baseless.
Andhra Pradesh's government was ""digging into all the internal files"" from the previous administration, under which the alleged misconduct took place, state Finance Minister Payyavula Keshav told Reuters on Monday.
""We will also examine what can be done next, like is there a possibility to cancel the contract ... state government is looking into this issue closely,"" Keshav said.
Live Events
A spokesperson for the Adani Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
The previous Andhra Pradesh ruling party, YSR Congress Party, last week denied any wrongdoing.
The U.S. indictment document said that following payment of alleged bribes to Indian officials, Andhra Pradesh's electricity distribution companies entered into a power supply agreement to purchase ""approximately seven gigawatts of solar power - by far the largest amount of any Indian state or region.""
The U.S. charges are the biggest setback for billionaire Adani, whose company shares and bonds have fallen sharply since the indictment.
French oil major
TotalEnergies
, which has a 20% stake in Adani Green, halted further investment into the Adani Group on Monday.

""The National Review Committee on Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources has recommended the appointment of a reputed legal and investigation agency to review the major power production agreements signed during the autocratic regime of
Sheikh Hasina
from 2009 to 2024,"" an official statement said.
The statement, issued by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus's office, said the committee was currently reviewing seven major energy and power projects, including the Adani (Godda) BIFPCL 1234.4 MW coal-fired plant, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Power Limited.

The six other agreements include one with a Chinese company that built a 1320 MW coal-fired power plant, while the rest are with Bangladeshi business groups said to be close to the past regime.
According to the statement, the committee gathered ""enormous proof"" warranting the agreements be ""scrapped or reconsidered"" in line with international arbitration laws and procedures. It said the committee needed additional time to further analyse other solicited and unsolicited contracts.
Live Events
""In doing so, we recommend immediate appointment of one or more top-level international legal and investigation agency or agencies to assist the committee,"" the statement said quoting a letter of the committee, headed by retired High Court judge Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury.
India's External Affairs Ministry had earlier said that cooperation in the power and energy sector has become one of the crucial pillars of India-Bangladesh relations.
The Adani Group, however, recently sent a letter to the Bangladesh government over its unpaid USD 800 million power supply bill while Bangladesh's state-run Power Development Board said they had already paid USD 150 million despite its dollar crisis and was expecting to pay the full amount.
Adani's Godda thermal plant was set up exclusively to supply power to Bangladesh but India recently changed a law allowing the Indian company to sell the Godda power in the domestic market sparking speculation if Bangladesh would get dedicated power supply from the plant.
The interim government had earlier formed a committee to examine contracts made under the Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provisions) Act, 2010 (Amended 2021).
The committee was tasked to investigate any allegations of corruption related to the country's electricity and energy production and supply agencies.

Uttarakhand
government is actively exploring the option of tariff-based competitive bidding for its proposed 1,320-MW thermal power plant, the first in the state, in order to rope in private players to develop the project. ""We may go for a tariff-based competitive bidding to involve private players,"" Uttarakhand's secretary for energy & renewable energy, planning and housing R Meenakshi Sundaram told ET.
The state government is looking to get the project commissioned ""quickly"", Sundaram said.
As per the initial proposal, the coal-based plant was to be developed by a joint venture of
Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam
(UJVN) Ltd and
THDC India Ltd
, for which the central government had given an in-principle approval in June. The
Central Electricity Authority
had previously recommended the supply of coal to Uttarakhand for the purpose of generating 1,320 MW of thermal power under the SHAKTI policy. If the state opts for the bidding process, it will have to request the
coal ministry
to consider fuel linkage under a different category, Sundaram said. While the state has a hydro power potential of around 18 GW, the current operational capacity is only around 4 GW. The state's solar power generation potential is low and it has kept a ""modest"" target of 2 GW capacity. ""And now we are in the process of going for at least one thermal power plant. This is because we have to address the issue of base load,"" Sundaram said. The state is also focusing on the potential of its pumped storage projects.
According to a government statement, 1,000 MW of pumped storage projects in Tehri are likely to be commissioned by December. In addition, 444 MW by THDC, 520 MW by
NTPC
and 300 MW by UJVN are under construction.

Kenya cancels power transmission deal with Adani following US bribery charges,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/kenya-cancels-power-transmission-deal-with-adani-following-us-bribery-charges/articleshow/115532088.cms,26-11-2024,"Kenyan President William Ruto said on Thursday he had ordered the cancellation of procurement process to expand the country's main airport, in which the government was considering a proposal by
Adani
Group.
Ruto said he had also directed the cancellation of a more than $700 million deal the energy ministry had signed with a unit of the Adani Group to construct power transmission lines.
""""I have directed agencies within the ministry of transport and within the ministry of energy and petroleum to immediately cancel the ongoing procurement,"" Ruto said in his state of the nation address, attributing the decision to ""new information provided by investigative agencies and partner nations"".
This comes after U.S. prosecutors indicted Adani for conspiring with executives of a former New York-listed company to devise a $265 million scheme to bribe Indian officials and boost their solar energy business.
Adani Group denied the allegations as ""baseless"", while Indian government officials haven't commented so far.
Live Events
Adani Energy Solutions in October signed a 30-year, $736 million public-private partnership deal with the
Kenya
Electrical Transmission Company. A court suspended the contract in the same month.
ALSO READ: Who are the defendants charged in US indictment of Gautam Adani?
What are the main allegations?
U.S. prosecutors charged Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani who is director at Adani Green, and six others with alleged bribery and fraud related to renewable energy projects in India that benefitted the tycoon's company and India's Azure Power, which was listed on the NYSE until late 2023.
ALSO READ: World's biggest solar deal at the centre of Adani's indictment
In 2020, the unsealed indictment from Wednesday shows, executives of Adani Green and Azure ""knowingly and wilfully conspired"" and agreed to ""corruptly"" offer, authorise and pay bribes to government officials in India to ""obtain or retain business advantages"".
Adani and his executives have also been accused of making false and misleading statements to investors and lenders in the United States regarding the company's anti-bribery commitments and practices while raising money from them.
Between 2021 and 2024, Adani raised more than $3 billion in loans and bonds, including from investors in the United States.
""Gautam and Sagar Adani were engaged in the bribery scheme during a September 2021 note offering by Adani Green that raised $750 million, including approximately $175 million from U.S. investors. The Adani Green offering materials included statements about its anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts that were materially false or misleading,"" the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said.
The Adanis earlier this year made misleading statements to the public, the Indian stock exchange and investors despite being made aware of the U.S. investigation in 2023, the prosecutors alleged.

Korba to get NTPC-BHEL's 800 MW hi-tech power plant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/korba-to-get-ntpc-bhels-800-mw-hi-tech-power-plant/articleshow/115499700.cms,21-11-2024,"New Delhi: India's first 800-MW advanced ultra-supercritical (AUSC) technology-based power plant of
NTPC-BHEL
may be set up at Korba in Chhattisgarh where the power generator already operates a 2,600-MW unit.
After much scouting, the companies have selected Korba as the site to develop the high-efficient plant, and feasibility studies have started for the site, people familiar with the development told ET. Initial estimates suggest the plant could cost around ₹15,000 crore, one of the persons told ET. The final cost estimate will be derived after the report.
The government had proposed fiscal support in its budget for the AUSC technology-based power plant, promoting indigenous technology with higher efficiency. A final nod from the power and heavy industries ministries for the site is likely to be given after the feasibility study report, one of the persons said.
BHEL
, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research and
NTPC
have developed the technology making it the first such indigenous technology.
Mails sent to
NTPC
and BHEL remained unanswered till the filing of the report.
AUSC-technology-based thermal power plants will have plant efficiency of 46% against 41-42% of supercritical sets and 38% efficiency of subcritical units, according to the ministry of heavy industries.
Live Events
It will also reduce coal consumption and carbon emissions by about 11% compared to super-critical plants.
As per the government, the technology development was completed in March 2021.
The future demand for energy, requirement of thermal power plants, policy of replacement of existing old plants by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and the ministry of power (MoP) is slated to drive the adoption of AUSC technology.

Delhi Pollution: Coal plants' target miss to add to the deadly smog,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhi-pollution-coal-plants-target-miss-to-add-to-the-deadly-smog/articleshow/115471758.cms,20-11-2024,"Most of India’s coal-burning plants are set to again fall short of a major pollution target, adding to the deadly smog that’s enveloped large parts of the country.
About three-quarters of the coal-fired generators near major cities are set to miss a year-end deadline to install equipment to curb sulfur-dioxide emissions, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public.
If fully implemented, such systems could cut India’s emissions of the pollutant by almost two-thirds, benefiting air quality and public health, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Sulfur dioxide breaks down into sulfates, which can account for almost a third of the particulate mass that forms India’s smog, according to Manoj Kumar, an analyst at the Finland-based research group.
About 20 gigawatts worth of coal plants near cities face the December deadline. Other generators near critically polluted areas must comply by end-2025, and the remainder a year later. The nation first targeted a clean-up of power plant emissions in 2015, and has already delayed compliance targets twice.
The Ministry of Power is preparing to seek a third extension of the deadline, as well as an exemption for plants that have fewer than 10 years to run, according to the people. Less than 10% of the nation’s total 218-gigawatt coal power fleet currently has the
pollution control equipment
installed.
Live Events
The power ministry didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment. The environment ministry, which must approve the extensions, also didn’t respond.
Objections to the steps include the high cost of installation and the need to shut down plants for about a month, which operators say could jeopardize electricity supply. India has battled blackouts in recent years as power demand outpaced supply growth.
The move would be a setback to efforts to combat the smog that’s been blamed for millions of premature deaths and diseases as well as economic losses due to the impact on productivity. Every year, a vast swathe of the country’s densely populated northern plains battles the pollution, which comes from vehicles, construction dust and the burning of crop waste after harvest as well as power plants.
Bloomberg
On Monday, New Delhi’s air quality index, a measure of pollutants, soared to more than 1,700, far exceeding the safe level of 50. Authorities have halted construction work, asked schools to conduct online classes and advised citizens to remain indoors as much as possible.
“We are faced with one of the worst air quality crises in years and this calls for urgent government action to accelerate pollution-control measures,” said Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at New Delhi-based environment advocacy firm EnviroCatalysts. “The environment ministry should pressurize the power ministry to act in the interest of public health, instead of siding with polluters.”

Fuel stock at coal-based plants up 52% this Winter,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/fuel-stock-at-coal-based-plants-up-52-this-winter/articleshow/115427719.cms,19-11-2024,"Domestic
coal-based power plants
have significantly higher coal stocks this winter season compared to last year, driven by better planning, increased coal production and enhanced rake supply, government officials said.
Higher availability of coal has led to sufficient base load capacity in the last few months and will help meet upcoming winter peak demand, they said.
As of November 17, coal stocks at domestic coal-based power plants were 52% higher year on year at around 33 million tonnes. Total coal stock at all power plants, including imported coal, was also 52% up at around 37 million tonnes.
""We are confident of reaching around 50 million tonnes (at power plants) by March end,"" a government official told ET. ""Power plants should aim to stock coal to start the summer season at a comfortable level.""
More production and supply are expected in the second half of the financial year, which will help build up stocks at power units, the official said.
Live Events
Considering the year-on-year increase in coal stock, the government last month decided not to extend an advisory that required plants to import some of their coal requirements. The government had earlier attributed increased coal dispatches to power plants this year to efficient logistical arrangements from coal, railways and power ministries to maintain an efficient supply chain.
The depletion of coal stocks at power plants in the June-September quarter was around 21%, mainly because of a seasonal drop in coal evacuation and transport, and a drop in wind power generation for some time during the period increasing the use of coal-based power.
The depletion slowed thereafter because of better supply and lower power demand. Between October 1 and November 16, the stocks at domestic coal-based plants rose marginally by 300,000 tonnes, according to the data from the National Power Portal.

Manohar Lal Khattar
, jointly inaugurated the first trilateral
power flow transaction
from Nepal to Bangladesh through a virtual event hosted by Nepal's Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation on Friday.
Kahattar, along with Md Fouzul Kabir Khan, adviser of Bangladesh's Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, and Nepali Minister of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation Dipak Khadka, inaugurated the power flow transaction, which had been carried out through the Indian grid.
According to a press statement, the power transaction from Nepal to Bangladesh, through the Indian grid, will export up to 40 MW of power.
The transaction was announced earlier in June 2023, during the visit of the former Prime Minister of Nepal, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, to India from May 31 to June 3.
During the visit, both sides had expressed their commitment towards greater sub-regional cooperation, including in the energy sector, which would lead to increased interlinkages between the economies for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.
Live Events
Following the inauguration, Union Minister Khattar said that the move would benefits all the three countries in the region.
""The power departments of the three countries have entered into an agreement with each other, Regional Cooperation for Power Purchase Sale and Distribution and Transmission, in which Nepal has signed an agreement with Bangladesh for 40 MW hydro power. The Nepal government has used India's transmission grid to send its electricity to Bangladesh... I think this will benefit all three countries,"" Khattar said.
A tripartite power sales agreement between NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, the Nepal Electricity Authority, and the Bangladesh Power Development Board was signed back in October this year in Kathmandu.
The start of this power flow from Nepal to Bangladesh through India is expected to boost sub-regional connectivity in the
power sector

union power ministry
has suggested states to consider listing some of their companies in the power sector on the
stock exchanges
, starting with transmission companies, for investment required in the future, power minister
Manohar Lal
said on Tuesday.
Power installation, transmission, generation and distribution have big projects that require big investments, he said after meeting with state power ministers. ""For such big investments, apart from existing methods to raise the investment amount, companies whose rankings are good can come forward for listing,"" he said.
It is believed that till 2030, an investment of ₹42 lakh crore is to be made in the power sector, he said, adding that currently companies depend on financial institutions and banks for raising funds. Lal said that Gujarat and Haryana have shown interest in listing their utilities on the bourses. ""This [listing] is only possible when the companies can achieve certain parameters and if they are willing to,"" Lal said.
He also said that going forward, the reporting of aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses of power distribution companies could be segregated to analyse the losses separately as they depend on different factors.
So far, such losses have been reported cumulatively. The AT&C losses in FY23 were 15.4%, while the provisional losses reported for FY24 are 17.6%, power secretary Pankaj Agarwal said.

The Indian government in its federal budget this year had proposed to partner with private players to develop small nuclear reactors to increase the amount of electricity from sources that do not produce carbon dioxide emissions.
States should consider setting up nuclear power plants at the sites where coal-based thermal power plants have completed their life,
Manohar Lal
, the country's power minister, told states as per a government statement.
India's stringent nuclear compensation laws have hampered talks with foreign power plant builders such as
General Electric
and
Westinghouse
.
The country, which currently has about 8 gigawatt of nuclear capacity, aims to increase it to 20 GW by 2032.

Bangladesh continues to get a reduced supply even though it has expedited the payment of dues and a Nov. 7 payment deadline by Adani had been lifted, the BPDB official said.
Reuters reported this week that the troubled South Asian country had opened a letter of credit for $170 million for Adani and was accelerating payments.
Adani Power
did not respond to queries from Reuters on the reduction in power supply and details of payments made by Dhaka.
The power supply has been gradually reduced based on demand from Bangladesh as well as keeping payment dues in mind, a source at Adani Power told Reuters.
The Bangladeshi board and Adani Power officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Bangladesh has been struggling to pay its bills due to costly fuel and goods imports since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The political turmoil that led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August has also compounded its troubles.

The move comes after Adani Power cut electricity supplies by half and threatened to stop supplies this week, over unpaid dues of $843 million (over Rs 7,000 crore).
“This is the third LC that the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has provided Adani Power. Bangladesh’s Krishi Bank has given the LC and ICICI Bank is its counterpart in India. The earlier LCs were not in line with the power purchase agreement,” said an official aware of the development.
Adani Power supplies nearly 1,600 MW power to Bangladesh from its coal-fired plant in Godda, Jharkhand. It has two units of nearly 800 MW each.
“Adani Power has additionally demanded a payment of $15-20 million from BPDB failing which the company will not restart the first unit of 800 MW which it shut down last week,” said an official aware of the development.
Adani Power did not respond to an email query.

The company meets 10% of Bangladesh’s electricity needs. The 25- year power purchase agreement (PPA) with BPDB was signed in 2015.
“Payment from BPDB is trickling in as Bangladesh has been granted a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),” said an industry official.
Between July and October, payment due to Adani Power is around $400 million and Bangladesh has paid less than half of it, said the official.
Monthly payments for power supply due to Adani Power amount to around $95-97 million. Bangladesh’s foreign currency reserves fell amid a political turmoil that ousted the Sheikh Hasina government in August. Bangladesh has been facing a challenge in generating dollar revenues and using the same for payment of imported electricity and oil. The interim government, which replaced Sheikh Hasina, has sought an additional $3 billion loan from the IMF in addition to an existing $4.7 billion bailout package.
PAYMENT OF RECEIVABLES
Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani had this September written to Muhammad Yunus, the chief adviser to the Bangladesh government, seeking his intervention in the early liquidation of nearly $850 million of receivables to the power producer.
The company wrote to the BPDB again last month requesting payment of the dues by October 30 and warning that a failure to clear the bills would lead to suspension of power supply by October 31 under the PPA. In addition to Adani Power, SEIL, NTPC Ltd and PTC India Ltd also sell power to Bangladesh.

The Bidder, being a subsidiary of Reliance Power Limited, had met the Financial Qualification Requirements using the strength of its Parent Company.
Upon detailed examination of the matter, it was found logical to conclude that all the commercial and strategic decisions undertaken by the Bidder were fundamentally driven by the Parent Company.
Thus, it became imperative to debar the Parent Company which is Reliance Power Limited from participating in future tenders issued by SECI.

Adani Power did not respond to Reuters queries on the payment deadline.
Bangladesh has been struggling to pay its bills due to costly fuel and goods imports since
Russia
invaded
Ukraine
in 2022. The political turmoil that led to the ouster of former Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina
in August has also compounded its troubles.
""Last month, we cleared $96 million, and this month, a letter of credit has been opened for an additional $170 million,""
Muhammad Fouzul
Kabir Khan, the power and energy adviser in the interim Bangladesh government, told Reuters.
Last month, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Bangladesh was scrutinising its contract with Adani Power, as it was charging Bangladesh a rate nearly 27% higher than those of India's other private producers.
Adani Power Chief Financial Officer Dilip Kumar Jha, in a quarterly earnings conference call last week, said there were no issues related to the power supply to Bangladesh.
""We hope that there will be no further deterioration in terms of the outstanding,"" he said.

India to revamp power demand forecasting for better planning,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-to-revamp-power-demand-forecasting-for-better-planning/articleshow/114930273.cms,04-11-2024,"India is overhauling the way it forecasts
electricity demand
to ensure generation capacity matches what’s needed and the grid remains stable with increasing volumes of
clean energy
.
The government’s Central Electricity Authority, or CEA, is seeking cooperation with weather agencies to access better environmental data and plans more frequent forecasts to account for unexpected events, said Ghanshyam Prasad, the chairperson of the planning body.
“We had been doing detailed demand assessment every five years, which we now plan to do every two years and eventually make it an annual exercise,” he said in an interview at his office in New Delhi.
Changing
power
usage patterns, rising use of intermittent solar and wind energy and increasingly frequent extreme weather events have complicated demand forecasting, requiring systemic reforms. Gauging future demand more precisely has become imperative to prevent supply-demand mismatches, keep costs in check for utilities and prevent blackouts.
Bloomberg
Demand assessments at a national level are based on aggregation from state distribution utilities, since more than 80% of the country’s electricity is traded through them.

But state utilities still follow archaic modeling methods, said Hitesh Chaniyara, partner for climate and energy at PwC India. These power retailers lack historic datasets, weather studies, technology and skilled personnel, often relying on “spreadsheets and gut feeling” to plot future demand, he said.
“That’s not going to work anymore,” Chaniyara said. “We can get national-level demand forecasts right only if state utilities are able to measure their own demand more accurately.”
As
climate change
makes the weather more erratic, access to more granular long and short-term data is now crucial to estimating power demand, CEA’s Prasad said. The planning agency is seeking longer-term climate projections from the India Meteorological Department to upgrade its models.
It is also looking for more location-specific weather data to be recorded multiple times in a day, Parasad said. Renewable energy is influenced by weather variability, and one storm has the potential to take a plant off the grid entirely, a void that must be filled by other sources until it’s put back up.
“We have asked all renewables companies to share the weather data they generate at their plant sites with the IMD, and most have started doing that,” Prasad said. “We are hoping
IMD
can process all that information and give us more granular forecasts.”

Adani Power
may stop supplying power to Bangladesh if that country does not settle its dues by November 7, said people aware of the development.
Unpaid bills totalling around $850 million (Rs 7,200 crore) have forced
Adani Power
Jharkhand Ltd, a subsidiary of Adani Power, to already cut its power supply to Bangladesh by half.
Adani Power had last month written to the
Bangladesh Power
Development Board (BPDB), asking it to clear the dues by October 31, the people said. The BPDB, in turn, provided a letter of credit (LC) of $170 million (Rs 1,500 crore) to ensure payment security, they said.
""The LC received was not in line with the power purchase agreement. Adani may be forced to shut the power supply around November 10,"" said a person aware of the development. Adani Power's Godda power plant in Jharkhand shut down one of its units last week to reduce power supply, the person said. The 1,496 MW plant operates at 700 MW from a single unit.
A shortage of dollars has caused the payment delay, the people said.
Live Events
Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani had this September written to Muhammad Yunus, the chief adviser to the Bangladesh government, seeking his intervention in the early liquidation of $800 million of receivables to the power producer.
Adani's letter stated that the company had invested $2 billion in building the plant and associated transmission infrastructure and delivered it in a record time of 3.5 years despite being impacted by three waves of Covid-19.
""I would like to reiterate our commitment to your country's energy security and infrastructure development,"" Adani wrote, adding that the group was keen to explore opportunities where it could leverage its expertise in infrastructure buildouts. The company wrote to the BPDB again last month, requesting payment of the dues by October 30 and warning that a failure to clear the bills would lead to suspension of power supply by October 31 under the power purchase agreement (PPA).
This September,
PTC India
and SEIL Energy India also wrote to the BPDB seeking to invoke bank guarantees because of non-payment for the power supplied. So far, however, the companies have not invoked the bank guarantees.
SEIL Energy India was owed more than $150 million as of June 30, 2024. Its bank guarantee amounts to ₹285 crore. The company has a PPA for 250 MW with Bangladesh.

Adani Power
Jharkhand Limited (APJL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Power, has stopped half of its power supply to Bangladesh because of outstanding bills of USD 846 million, according to a local media report on Friday. Data from Power Grid Bangladesh PLC showed the Adani plant reduced supply on Thursday night, The Daily Star newspaper said.
Bangladesh reported a shortfall of more than 1,600 megawatts (MW) on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday as the 1,496 MW plant is now producing 700 MW from a single unit, the newspaper reported.
Earlier, the Adani company wrote to the power secretary asking the
Bangladesh Power Development Board
(PDB) to clear its outstanding dues by October 30.
The letter, dated October 27, said that if the bills are not paid, the company shall be constrained to take remedial action under the
Power Purchase Agreement

The company said that the PDB has neither provided a letter of credit (LC) for an amount of USD 170.03 million from
Bangladesh Krishi Bank

The newspaper quoted a PDB official as saying that they had earlier cleared a portion of previous dues, but since July, Adani has been charging more than the previous months.
He said the PDB has been paying around USD 18 million weekly, while the charge is more than USD 22 million.
""This is why the due payments increased again,"" he said, adding that they had submitted last week's payment to Krishi Bank as well, but due to a dollar shortage, the bank failed to open a letter of credit against the payment.
About the additional payment, he said, when the PDB raised a question on the coal pricing in February last year, they signed a supplementary deal that obliged Adani to quote coal prices less than the rates charged by the other coal-fired power plants.
After the tenure of the one-year supplementary deal, Adani has again started charging as per the PPA, the report said.
According to the PPA, coal prices are calculated based on the average price of two coal indices -- the Indonesian coal index and the Australian Newcastle index -- which increases the prices.
Adani said that during the period of suspension of supply, the company reserves its right to recover capacity payments under Section 13.2(1) of the PPA.
Adani has been pressing the interim government to pay the dues since they took charge after the ouster of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
An interim government led by Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus was installed in Bangladesh on August 8.

The peak power demand touched an all-time high of about 250 GW in May this year. The previous all-time high peak power demand of 243.27 GW was recorded in September 2023.
Earlier this year, the power ministry projected a peak power demand of 235 GW during the day and 225 GW during evening hours for May while 240 GW during daytime and 235 GW in the evening hours for June.
The ministry also estimated that peak power demand may hit 260 GW this summer.

Noting that October 2024 was the warmest in many decades as per official data, the experts opined that power demand as well as consumption showed marginal growth mainly due to a higher base effect.
They further added that the decline in peak power demand in October also shows the effect of the onset of winter season, especially in Northern India where consumption of
electricity
rises due to use of cooling appliances like air conditioners and desert coolers.
However, they said that the demand for power and consumption will continue to be steady in the coming days due to good commercial and industrial activities.

India begins to examine curbs on most potent greenhouse gas,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-begins-to-examine-curbs-on-most-potent-greenhouse-gas/articleshow/114763478.cms,30-10-2024,"India’s government and the
power industry
are exploring a possible phase down of what’s considered to be the most
potent greenhouse gas
, although high costs of alternatives stand in the way of a regulation.
Sulfur hexafluoride gas, or SF6, which is used as an insulator in power transmission equipment, has a warming potential that’s 23,500 times that of carbon dioxide. It’s found in circuit breakers and switchgears, the demand for which is surging due to the government’s push for more electrification.
The stable nature that makes SF6 an excellent insulator also aggravates its impacts on the climate. The gas can linger in the atmosphere for more than 1,000 years and has high heat-trapping properties. Fluorinated gases, including SF6, accounted for just 2.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, but their use has increased rapidly over the past three decades, a trend that is now causing global concerns.
“There’s a need to regulate it and a discussion has started,” Ghanshyam Prasad, chair at the government’s
Central Electricity Authority
said in an interview. “We’ll need to do it at some point, but for that to happen, costs of alternative technologies need to become affordable.”
Substitutes would require changes in the design and building of equipment that could end up inflating the cost by two to three times, according to Reshu Madan, chief executive officer for global products and services at
Sterlite Power
.
Live Events
That’s a big red flag for India’s competitive power market, where the government is already concerned with supply constraints increasing the cost of transmission equipment.
Economies of scale can break the impasse, according to Vikram Gandotra, president-elect at Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers’ Association. “Demand needs to be aggregated from utilities,” which in turn will drive down costs, he said.
Meanwhile, new regulations in some parts of the world have thrust manufacturers into action. The EU has passed norms for a staggered phase-out of SF6-containing switchgears starting from 2026, while US states such as California and Massachusetts have also set rules for either ending their use or limiting leakages.
The equipment employing SF6 is designed to be tightly insulated, but leaks can develop throughout its life cycle, from manufacturing and installation to decommissioning, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Significant leakages can occur from aging gear, the agency warned, adding that about 67% of all SF6 emissions in the US in 2022 came from power utilities.

SC seeks response from SKS Power and lenders on Torrent Power's appeal against Sarda Energy's resolution plan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sc-seeks-response-from-sks-power-and-lenders-on-torrent-powers-appeal-against-sarda-energys-resolution-plan/articleshow/114738492.cms,29-10-2024,"The
Supreme Court
had sought response from debt-ridden
SKS Power Generation
(Chhattisgarh) Ltd, its lenders and its resolution professional on an appeal by
Torrent Power
challenging the approval granted to
Sarda Energy and Minerals
resolution plan for takeover of the power generation firm.
A Bench led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud while issuing notice to SKS, its Committee of Creditors and resolution professional Ashish Arjunkumar Rathi and Sarda Energy, the successful resolution applicant, observed that “there is much more than what meets the eye.”
The apex court also noted senior counsel AM Singhvi’s submission on behalf of Torrent that the Sarda’s bid was modified in material respects after the conclusion of the negotiation process. However, the CJI directed that “any further steps which are taken in implementation of the
resolution plan
by the second respondent (Sarda) shall not create any equities in their favour.”
It also posted the matter for further hearing on November 12.
Torrent has told the SC that Sarda had selectively been allowed to revise its commercial offer (by two deviations at the very least) in a “surreptitious and clandestine manner” after the conclusion of the negotiation process and the disclosure of the final bid to all resolution applicants.”

“The selection of the successful resolution applicant by the resolution professional and CoC has been done in complete disregard to the settled principles of fairness, transparency and level playing field,” the Ahmedabad-based company said, adding that discrimination was made towards other resolution applicants as Sarda was given an opportunity in the guise of seeking clarification to pay Rs 240 crore upfront payment, which was not proposed earlier.
Even Sarda was allowed to modify/increase amount of infusion of funds towards replacement margin

Mahagenco
and public sector
NTPC
has emerged as the top bidder to take over the 1,350 MW
Sinnar Thermal Power
plant near Nashik.
Mahagenco's bid of Rs 3,800 crore is above the second-placed
Adani Power
in the initial round of bids. Lenders are evaluating legal and other compliances of the bidders, following which negotiations with individual bidders will start, said people familiar with the process.
""The early bids put the Mahagenco-NTPC partnership at the top. The second-placed bidder is behind as its bid is less than Rs 3,000 crore. But the plans are still at the initial stage and we could see revisions since all parties interested are serious players in this sector,"" said a person familiar with the process. Resolution professional (RP) Rahul Jindal did not reply to an email seeking comment.
Commodities company
Vedanta Group
, Naveen Jindal's Jindal Power, Kolkata-based Orissa Metaliks and Varde Partners' Singapore-based arm VFSI Holdings are among seven companies that have made a formal bid to take over the distressed 1,350 MW Sinnar Thermal Power. Individual bidders could not be contacted.
The Mahagenco-NTPC combine is best placed because it runs the 2,190 MW Koradi
power plant
near Nagpur and can use its existing infrastructure to supply coal and run the plant.
Live Events
The power plant, a subsidiary of
RattanIndia Power
, was initially developed by
Indiabulls Power
and was admitted to insolvency in January following a plea by
Shapoorji Pallonji
& Co for non-payment of dues after constructing a part of the plant. All bidders have submitted an initial resolution plan, including a Rs 10 crore deposit.
BoB Caps, the
investment banking
arm of Bank of Baroda, is the advisor to the committee of creditors (CoC), while Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co is the legal advisor. Trilegal is the legal advisor to the RP.
Power Finance Corp (Rs 6,553 crore) and its subsidiary
REC
(Rs 5,262 crore) are the top two creditors of the company, which owes total dues of Rs 15,909 crore.
Punjab National Bank
,
Axis Bank
,
Canara Bank
,
Bank of India
and Life Insurance Corp are other creditors to the company.
Although only one unit of 270 MW has achieved commercial operations and the remaining four units have worked at full load for only a few hours, this is a rare power producer readily available in India, where building a greenfield project is both time-consuming and expensive. Though the plant is now defunct, it has 1,600 acres around it, which means any company buying it can double its capacity by adding another 1,350 MW.
Right-of-way issues and lack of railway linkage to the plant will have to be factored in by any prospective buyer. Coal has been a major challenge for Sinnar since December 2022, when the South Eastern Coalfields cancelled the
coal supply contract
citing the non-availability of PPA and non-commissioning of the majority of units of the plant. Sinnar's PPA with Mahadiscom was cancelled a few years ago.

According to the power ministry directive, any sum not provided in the tariff orders will not be recognised as revenue or income recoverable from future tariff in the financial statements.
ET Bureau
Live Events
Discom are now seeking clarity regarding the status of existing regulatory assets and how to account for them, said people in the know.
State discoms handle last-mile connectivity, acting as intermediaries between power producers and end consumers. Due to the sensitive nature of business, tariff revisions by discom are governed by
state electricity regulatory commissions
(SERCs).
Traditionally, discom have sought future recoverable after various court orders allowed higher costs that can be passed on to consumers. ""SERCs tend to delay adoption of court orders, leading to creation of regulatory assets that can be recovered from subsequent tariff orders,"" said an official from a discom, adding that accounting of any new regulatory asset will now require approval from state regulator.
""The power ministry's directive is expected to improve the working of regulators as well,"" the official said.
Discoms are expecting about ₹1.53 lakh crore as regulatory assets that they hope to recover from prospective tariff hikes. Discoms in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Delhi have highest regulatory assetssince regulators have disallowed earlier
tariff hikes
to safeguard end consumers.

Transformer steel shortage could impact India's energy ambitions: GTRI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/transformer-steel-shortage-could-impact-indias-energy-ambitions-gtri/articleshow/114688553.cms,28-10-2024,"Shortage of Cold-Rolled Grain-Oriented (CRGO) steel used for making transformers and electric motors could impact India's ambitious
power sector
expansion plans, think tank
GTRI
said on Monday. The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that India's power sector is facing a 30 per cent shortage of
CRGO steel
, essential for electric motors and transformers.
With domestic production meeting only about 10-12 per cent of demand, India relies heavily on imports, it added.
It said the immediate cause of the CRGO steel shortage is import uncertainty caused by the delayed license renewals by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for many foreign suppliers from Japan, South Korea and China.
Many of the licenses are set to expire soon, causing shortages and uncertainty in the power sector, it said, adding that foreign suppliers require BIS certification under a Quality Control Order, which ensures quality but restricts options to a few approved grades and vendors.
The entire BIS process needs an urgent review by independent auditors, the think tank said.

""In the long term, India must prioritise local production, as CRGO is now considered a strategic material, and supply may remain limited. Without action, this shortage could jeopardise India's ambitious energy goals,"" GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava said.
CRGO's grain orientation reduces energy loss, making it essential for transformer cores, which are central to India's power distribution network.
In FY 2024, India, one of the largest consumers of CRGO steel, required 400,000 tonnes. With only 50,000 tonnes produced domestically, it had to import 239.2 thousand tonnes from countries like China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.
After exporting 11.4 thousand tonnes, only 277.8 thousand tonnes were available for local use, leaving a shortfall of 122.2 thousand tonnes, or 30.6 per cent of total demand, it said.
It added that India's CRGO demand is expected to grow by 10-12 per cent annually, driven by the expanding power sector and the goal to integrate 500 GW of
renewable energy
into the grid by 2030.
Srivastava said that the demand will also grow as the Bureau of Energy Efficiency has mandated a star-label upgrade for distribution transformers starting January 1, 2025, pushing the industry to seek higher-grade CRGO steel.
""This CRGO shortage could impact energy and manufacturing targets. This shortage also limits India's transformer and motor exports. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), who need small amounts of this steel, are hit hardest, as prices have soared due to uncertain supplies,"" he added.
To address the CRGO steel shortage, immediate and long-term measures are essential, he said, adding that the BIS should expedite its approval process for CRGO imports to prevent license expirations and ensure a steady supply.
Additionally, BIS should expand the list of approved CRGO grades and suppliers to support smaller manufacturers and MSMEs, who are the most vulnerable to these shortages, he added.
""At the government level, support for domestic production is crucial, and allowing zero-duty imports of raw materials for CRGO production, as seen in countries like China, the US and Germany, could boost local output,"" it said.
Building a CRGO plant would require significant investment of around USD 400-USD 600 million for a facility with an annual capacity of 100,000-150,000 tonnes and could take 3-5 years to complete, with potential government incentives supporting this development, it said.
The Quality Control Order (QCO) for CRGO steel, implemented by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in 2020, mandates that all CRGO steel imported for use in India must meet specific performance standards under BIS certification, it added.

JSW Energy emerges top bidder for KSK Mahanadi Power,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/jsw-energy-emerges-top-bidder-for-ksk-mahanadi-power/articleshow/114664361.cms,28-10-2024,"Mumbai: Sajjan Jindal-promoted
JSW Energy
emerged as the top bidder for
KSK Mahanadi Power
, offering Rs 15,985 crore to financial creditors and outbidding
Adani Power
at an auction that ended on Saturday, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Six companies participated in a two-day intense bidding process. Adani Power opted out of the race after making a final offer of Rs 15,885 crore in the 10th round, people cited above said. JSW Energy, the sole bidder in the 11th round, topped Adani’s bid by Rs 100 crore. JSW and Adani offered 26% equity stake to lenders and another Rs 100 crore to operational creditors.
Financial services firm
Capri Global
, was also in the fray but exited after making a final offer of Rs 15,850 crore in the 10th round, while Naveen Jindal promoted Jindal Power, Anil Agarwal’s
Vedanta
and government-owned power company
NTPC Ltd
were active bidders until the 9th round of the bidding process, people cited above said.
PwC supported the resolution professional (RP), Sumit Binani.
JSW Energy and Adani Power did not respond to ET’s request for comments.
Live Events
The RP has admitted Rs 29,330 crore claims from financial creditors. For lenders, the upfront recovery will be about Rs 26,485 crore or 90% (including JSW’s offer of Rs 15,985 crore and Rs 10,500 crore as cash and undisputed fund receivables). However, if a 26% equity stake is factored, the recovery will be over 100%, a lender said. In August, NCLT allowed the RP to distribute Rs 6,400 crore cash (out of Rs 10,500 crore) in the company.
For JSW Energy, this is the third prominent acquisition in the power sector. In December 2022, it acquired 700 MW Ind Barath Energy (Utkal) for an enterprise value of Rs 1,048 crore and in March 2023, its subsidiary JSW Neo Energy acquired a 1,753-MW renewable energy portfolio from Mytrah Energy at an enterprise value of approximately Rs 10,150 crore. KSK Mahanadi Power has three operational coal-based units of 600 MW each in Chhattisgarh.
Adani had been eyeing KSK Mahanadi Power, promoted by Kishore Sethuraman, for over six years. In late 2018, Adani offered Rs 10,300 crore, but it backed out in February 2019 after the Uttar Pradesh government revised tariffs downward. Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, it has acquired at least three power companies — Avantha Power’s Korba West Power, Coastal Energen and Lanco Amarkantak Power.
JSW Energy and other bidders who participated in the auction process will have to submit a final resolution detailing the structure of payment. The RP will thereafter invite lenders to vote on the resolution plans. For the auction, RP set a reserve price of Rs 12,500 crore, which was anchored on Adani Power’s higher upfront payment offer made in the first round of the bidding process. In that round, Adani had given an all-inclusive offer of Rs 27,000 crore comprising Rs 12,500 crore upfront payment, Rs 10,400 crore cash in the company, Rs 2,000 crore undisputed receivables and Rs 2,000 crore disputed receivables.
The debt resolution of KSK Mahanadi, which was admitted into the National Company Law Tribunal in 2019, is delayed due to a series of litigations. Losing patience, a dozen lenders with Rs 16,165 crore of verified claims among them, separately sold their debts to various asset reconstruction companies (ARC).
As many as six ARCs jointly control 54.4% of verified claims after acquiring loans from multiple banks. Aditya Birla ARC, a 50:50 joint venture between Aditya Birla Capital and Varde Partners, was an early entrant in acquiring debt from lenders such as Axis Bank and SBI. It now holds a critical 34% stake in the thermal power company. Under India’s insolvency process, no resolution can pass until 66% of lenders approve it; effectively, a debt holder with little over 34% can block a resolution.
Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas advised the resolution professional, while Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas advised the committee of creditors.

AI power demand might actually be good for climate,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ai-power-demand-might-actually-be-good-for-climate/articleshow/114598670.cms,26-10-2024,"Big energy companies are making the case that skyrocketing
electricity demand
from data centres - and the need to build more power sources to meet it -- will end up being good for the climate.
Several company executives have plugged the counterintuitive claim over the past month: Cam Hosie, senior vice president of new energy at SLB, the world's biggest oilfield service provider, called the rapid increase in electricity demand the ""greatest blessing"" the
energy transition
could hope for. The sentiment was echoed by Scott Strazik, chief executive officer of GE Vernova. Strazik said the phenomenon would be ""net-decarbonizing.""
But when companies that profit off
fossil fuels
tout the virtues of the transition to
clean energy
, skepticism typically follows. ""We see it as a big threat to
decarbonization
,"" said Laurie Williams, director of the Beyond Coal Campaign at the Sierra Club.
At the heart of the debate is the massive new demand for electricity in the US that's expected to accelerate in the coming years. Demand growth is expected to jump by as much as 15% in some regions over the next five years, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The increase is being driven by the electrification of the economy along with new factories and the rise of power-hungry
data centers
that support artificial intelligence.
Rising power demand has already delayed some coal-plant retirements and sparked a huge plan for the buildout of natural gas-fired plants, which usually have at least a 40-year lifespan.
Live Events
""If they just say they need power as quickly as possible, it's going to lead to further entrenchment of a fossil-fuel grid,"" Williams said. But energy company executives argue that demand gains will actually provide both the pressure and financial incentive necessary to reform the US electric grid.
""It takes it away from being a zero-sum game to being a growth story,"" SLB's Hosie said at a BloombergNEF event in New York in late September during Climate Week NYC. ""Growth equals investment.""
Indeed, while BloombergNEF data show
natural gas
remains the biggest source of electricity generation in the US, much more new solar and wind power are added each year than gas.
Rising power demand will create the opportunity to restructure our entire energy system, said GE Vernova's Strazik. His company is spending money to develop small modular nuclear reactors, carbon capture and hydrogen-burning gas turbines that would be hard to justify without demand growth. ""It gives us an opportunity at scale to accelerate new technology,"" he said in an interview. ""In a flat market you'd have a hard time making those investments.""
Utility executives have made the same point. ""We can have load growth that enables the clean-energy transition,"" PG&E Corp. Chief Executive Officer Patti Poppe said in an interview at the RE+ Conference in Anaheim in September. She added that if the California utility spent up to $1.5 billion to meet an additional gigawatt of data center power demand, the revenue from that new load would cut all customer bills between 1%-2% and free up funds to make the grid more reliable.
And at the same time, tech companies have climate goals to reach net-zero carbon emissions and prefer clean energy for data centers. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have each announced nuclear deals recently that aim to power operations with carbon-free generation.

"Bangladesh will soon receive power from India, project in last stages",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bangladesh-will-soon-receive-power-from-india-project-in-last-stages/articleshow/114595174.cms,25-10-2024,"Bangladesh will soon begin receiving power from the Indian grid, which will be transmitted from Nepal, said Anurag Srivastava, Joint Secretary for North and former spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), during an event in Bengaluru on Friday. He emphasized that India’s revised cross-border electricity policy, which permits neighbouring countries to use its grid, has made a substantial shift in regional cooperation. The countries have signed an agreement for the transmission of 40 megawatts of power from Nepal to Bangladesh through the Indian grid.
“The first such transaction with Bangladesh is in its final stages, with the agreement already signed, this trade is poised to become Nepal’s largest export over the next 5 to 7 years,” Srivastava highlighted. He was speaking on ‘India's Neighbourhood First Policy Operations’ concerning Bhutan and Nepal, at an event organized by Synergia, a Bengaluru-based think tank.
The former MEA spokesperson noted that over the past three years significant progress has been achieved between India and Nepal making the power collaboration “one of the most critical developments in the economic relationship between the two countries.”
Srivastava reiterated that starting from zero megawatts just three years ago, the country has now reached 1,000 megawatts. “With a newly signed agreement, we are well on our way to scaling this up to 10,000 megawatts in the coming years.”
Discussing future plans, he noted that the Indian investments in power generation in the neighbouring country have now reached twice the installed capacity, signalling a robust energy partnership. “We are also enhancing transmission capacity to facilitate the export of this power.”
Live Events
Speaking about trade infrastructure along the 1,751 km Nepal border and the 699 km Bhutan border, Srivastava noted that the Indian government has ramped up efforts to establish “one-stop shops,” which are multimodal connectivity points that have led to a significant boost in trade. “Along the Nepal border, the next set of three Integrated Check Posts (ICPs) is currently under development. For the India-Bhutan border, we are planning the first set of ICPs,” he said.

Bids for KSK Mahanadi Power skyrocket after Adani's offer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bids-for-ksk-mahanadi-power-skyrocket-after-adanis-offer/articleshow/114594723.cms,25-10-2024,"Adani Group
's Rs 12,500 crore bid to acquire
KSK Mahanadi Power
has prompted other bidders to revise their offers upwards, and the final number could be much higher, according to sources. Following the implementation of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) Challenge Mechanism, lenders to the distressed power plant are now hopeful of a full recovery from the
non-performing asset
, an extremely rare feat in IBC proceedings.
Sources within the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework have credited Adani's initial high bid of Rs 12,500 crore, which was 62 per cent or Rs 4,800 crore higher than the second bidder for reigniting interest in KSK Mahanadi.
Six of the original ten bidders, including
NTPC
, have now submitted revised offers close to Adani's bid, demonstrating strong competition and driving up the asset's value. This reflects the IBC's emphasis on value maximisation, industry insiders noted.
Adani's competitive bid, which aggregates to Rs 27,000 crore when combined with KSK Mahanadi's reported cash reserves of Rs 10,000 crore and trade receivables worth Rs 4,000 crore, means the lenders could achieve an unprecedented 92 per cent recovery.
Located in Chhattisgarh, KSK Mahanadi has an installed capacity of 1,800 MW. The project, which had accumulated Rs 29,330 crore in debt, was brought into the
IBC process
in 2019.
Adani Power
's Rs 12,500 crore bid was the highest offer among competing entities, which included industry heavyweights like
JSW Energy
, Jindal Power
Vedanta
, NTPC and
Coal India
. The other bids had previously ranged between Rs 6,500 crore and Rs 7,700 crore, significantly lower than Adani's offer.

Despite Adani's impressive bid, particularly after its recent acquisitions of Lanco Amarkantak (1,920 MW) and Coastal Energen (1,200 MW) through similar IBC processes, the CoC held a Challenge Mechanism to encourage further competition.
This has resulted in more robust bids from the remaining contenders. Adani's bid for KSK Mahanadi illustrates a critical juncture for the IBC, where corporate influence and the potential for value maximisation converge. While some may view this as a troubling concentration of power, others could argue that it is a necessary evolution in the Indian insolvency landscape.

Kenyan court suspends $736 million Adani power line deal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/kenyan-court-suspends-736-million-adani-power-line-deal/articleshow/114590856.cms,25-10-2024,"Kenya
's high court on Friday suspended a $736 million deal between a state utility and India's
Adani Energy Solutions
to build and operate
power infrastructure
including transmission lines.
The
public-private partnership
agreement between state-owned Kenya Electrical Transmission Company (
KETRACO
) and
Adani Energy Solutions
was signed earlier this month.
On Oct. 11 the energy ministry said it would help address persistent
power blackouts
and support economic growth.
The high court said the government could not move ahead with the 30-year agreement with Adani Energy Solutions until the court makes a determination on a case brought by
Law Society of Kenya
challenging the deal.
The law society has argued that the power deal is ""a constitutional sham"" and ""tainted with secrecy"".

The law society also said KETRACO and Adani Energy Solutions did not carry out meaningful public participation around the project, a requirement under Kenya's Public Private Partnerships Act of 2021 which allows private sector development of public projects.
The energy ministry said previously that it had run a competitive bidding process.
A spokesperson for Adani Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Adani Group, founded by Indian billionaire
Gautam Adani
, sparked anger in Kenya recently for another proposed public-private partnership project to lease the country's main airport for 30 years in exchange for expanding it.
The Law Society of Kenya, along with the Kenya Human Rights Commission, has also challenged the proposed airport deal in court, saying it is unaffordable, threatens job losses and does not offer value for money.

Power Trust ups bid for Hiranmaye Energy after Damodar Valley Corp emerges as top bidder,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-trust-ups-bid-for-hiranmaye-energy-after-damodar-valley-corp-emerges-as-top-bidder/articleshow/114572306.cms,25-10-2024,"Mumbai:
Power Trust
, promoter of Kolkata-based
Hiranmaye Energy
, has raised its offer for the
thermal power company
after
Damodar Valley Corporation
(DVC) was declared the top bidder in a recent challenge auction. DVC had offered Rs 1,500 crore, surpassing the Rs 1,300 crore reserve price, making it the highest bidder in terms of net present value for creditors’ recovery.
Power Trust had initially proposed Rs 1,450 crore to settle the dues of
REC
and
Power Finance Corporation
(PFC) within 90 days and promised to handle the remaining creditor payments separately. In a subsequent move, the company raised its offer to Rs 1,600 crore, excluding the cash balance and trade receivables of Hiranmaye Energy on the transfer date, which it said would be released to secured financial creditors.
According to Power Trust’s settlement proposal, despite the opportunity for bidders to revise their offers on October 14, 2024, during negotiations with the Committee of Creditors (CoC), Power Trust claimed it was not given the chance to adjust its bid.
DVC emerged as the winner in the auction that concluded on October 14, offering Rs 1,500 crore, outbidding other contenders including Jindal Power,
Vedanta
, and
CESC
promoted by Sanjiv Goenka. These companies were among eight firms vying to acquire Hiranmaye Energy, which has been undergoing
corporate insolvency
since January after a plea filed by
REC Ltd
at the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT) in Kolkata.
Hiranmaye Energy operates three 150 MW units in Haldia, with two units currently operational. The company also has a 25-year power purchase agreement with the West Bengal government and a
coal supply agreement
with Coal India. It attracted 31 expressions of interest in July, followed by eight resolution plans submitted by the end of August.

Odisha's Department of Energy
, has said that energy grids and
emergency transmission towers
in the districts expected to be affected by
Cyclone Dana
are being monitored.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Cyclone Dana would cross the north Odisha and West Bengal coasts between Puri and Sagar Island during the night of October 24 and early morning of October 25.
""All preparations are going on. Our electricity distribution companies in Baleswar, Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Puri, and Cuttack have alerted their executive engineers and SDPOs and set up a control room. Manpower has been arranged to repair and restore any kind of damage,"" Sharma told ANI.
""Working gangs have been mobilised.
Vulnerable grids
and emergency transmission towers in these districts are being mapped. Our arrangements will be completed as per the SOP in the coming days. We will control the
power supply
on 24-25 October, seeing the intensity of rain and the wind speed,"" he added.
Meanwhile.
Odisha Chief Minister
Mohan Charan Majhi has said that the state government is fully prepared to tackle any situation arising out of Cyclone Dana.
Live Events
""Zero casualties will be ensured. There is no need to panic. The government is fully prepared to tackle the situation,"" Majhi said after a review meeting on the state's cyclone preparedness.
""100% evacuation will be made after identifying vulnerable areas.
NDRF
, ODRAF & Fire Services teams are kept ready. The government is closely monitoring the situation,"" he added.
The Chief Minister said that cyclone shelters will be equipped with all necessities and essential commodities.
""Discussion was also held for early restoration of power and water supply and telephone and road communication. Uninterrupted electricity will be ensured to hospitals. The concerned department has already kept a close watch to prevent hoarding or overcharging of essential commodities,"" the Chief Minister said.
Odisha Deputy Chief Minister Kanak Vardhan Singh Deo said on Monday that multiple departments in the state have been instructed to be on high alert as the IMD has predicted heavy rainfall in the state due to cyclone Dana.
""The Odisha government is in total preparedness in both the energy and agriculture departments, apart from that the revenue department is also totally prepared. We have taken our reviews, the department has issued necessary instructions to the concerned officers and others. Their leaves have been cancelled and they've all been told to be on high alert,"" the Dy CM told ANI.
The Deputy CM further told that Kendrapara, Balasore and Bhadrak will be mainly affected by the cyclone.
""The basic issue is that now even the Meteorological Department is not able to predict and project which way the cyclone is going to go...They are estimating that it may move towards North Odisha. Three districts may mainly be affected, Kendrapara, Balasore and Bhadrak. The rest of the coastal districts like Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Ganjam and others may receive heavy rainfall,"" he said.
Mentioning that advisories have been given to various officers to prepare for evacuation, the deputy CM added, ""Basic advisories have been given to all the agricultural officers and the district collectors and everybody to be prepared to ensure that whatever rainwater comes is quickly evacuated,"" he added.

"L&T outbids BHEL for ₹40,000 cr NTPC tender",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/lt-outbids-bhel-for-40000cr-ntpc-tender/articleshow/114436684.cms,21-10-2024,"New Delhi: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has outbid Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (
BHEL
) for contracts worth over ₹40,000 crore floated by state-owned
NTPC
to set up three coal-fired
power plants
, in an indication of resurgence of private sector interest in the
thermal power
sector.
According to officials aware of the development, L&T outbid BHEL for all these projects. ""L&T has bid ₹43,559.83 crore for setting up these three projects while BHEL's bid stood at ₹45,325.31 crore for them,"" one of the officials cited above told ET.
NTPC's past few tenders had witnessed interest only from state-owned BHEL.
Muted private sector response to these tenders prompted relaxation in some norms. The government also held discussions with the stakeholders on issues that were keeping them away.
In May, the Central
Electricity Authority
(CEA) relaxed pre-qualification requirements allowing companies with experience in erection of 'sub-critical' units to participate in '
supercritical
' ones to encourage competition.
Live Events
The government is keen on thermal capacities coming up quickly even as it focuses on green transition to support the country's growth.
India's present installed thermal
power generation
capacity stands at 217.5 GW. According to power ministry's estimates, the country needs an additional 80 GW installed thermal power capacity by 2031-32. As per the CEA, the capital cost for setting up of new coal-based thermal capacity is estimated at ₹8.34 crore per megawatt (MW) (at 2021-22 price level).
Contract Details
NTPC had invited bids on bulk tender basis for three super thermal power projects (STPPs) in August this year. In all,
NTPC
called bids for 6.4 GW of additional
coal-fired power
generation capacity in this round. These projects were Gadarwara STPP stage-II (in Madhya Pradesh), Telangana STPP stage-II and Nabinagar STPP stage-II (in Bihar) with the scope of work including design, engineering, manufacture, supply, construction, erection, testing and commissioning works for the main plant package based on single point responsibility.

NCLT rejects REC plea against global metal over default date,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nclt-rejects-rec-plea-against-global-metal-over-default-date/articleshow/114403497.cms,20-10-2024,"The bankruptcy tribunal rejected
REC Ltd
's application against Global Metal & Energy Pvt Ltd, saying the default occurred when initiation of
insolvency proceedings
was barred amid the
Covid disruption
and that a lender cannot change the date of default by issuing a fresh notice after the end of the prohibited period.
The ruling is expected to set a precedent for cases where lenders have approached the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) to admit defaulting companies under the
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process
(CIRP) but the date of default was within the period covered under Section 10A of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
The government brought Section 10A in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown, saying that no application for initiation of CIRP should be filed for a default occurring on or after March 25, 2020, for six months or a period not exceeding one year.
ET Bureau
State-run REC had approached the Mumbai bench of the NCLT against Global Metal & Energy after the company defaulted on its dues of about ₹39.57 crore.
The infrastructure financier had sectioned a loan facility of over ₹47 crore to the company in June 2015 for setting up a 10MW wind power project in Maharashtra's Sangli district. The company was unable to repay the loan and was declared a defaulter on March 31, 2020. The lender declared the company a non-performing asset on March 31, 2021.

Counsel Omkar Deosthale, appearing for Global Metal & Energy, argued that REC's application was barred under Section 10A of the Code, since the date of default was March 31, 2020 that fell within the period covered by the provision.
""The date of default occurring within the prohibited period cannot be shifted merely because a notice for payment is issued again after the end of such prohibited period,"" the division bench of judicial member KR Saji Kumar and technical member Sanjiv Dutt observed in its order of October 15.
According to Nisha Kaba, an independent counsel practicing IBC, this ruling will act as a precedent where creditors, by way of clever drafting, attempt to shift the date of default beyond the 10A period.

.
Niti Aayog
, the government's premier think-tank, has held stakeholder consultations in this regard and is likely to recommend this in its final report by month end, officials said.
The Aayog had made such a suggestion in a draft report, after which intensive consultations were carried out before firming up the view, they said.
""There is no advantage in installing FGD in Indian coal-based low sulphur
thermal power plants
. This will only increase power generation cost,"" an official aware of the contents of NITI's draft report told ET.

An environment ministry notification dated September 2022 mandates all coal-fired thermal power plants in the country to comply with SO2 emission norms by December 2026 or shell out a penalty, payable on per unit electricity generated, if they are not compliant beyond the deadline. However, the Aayog is of the view that the government can keep the power generation cost under check by doing away with
FGD units
.
""It is now recommended that placement of new orders for installation of FGD may be stopped,"" the Aayog's draft report said while suggesting that all thermal power plants (TPP) where FGD is already installed should be used for data collection.
The move comes after a study conducted by the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) found that SO2 emissions from Indian coal-based power plants were not adversely impacting ambient air quality.
The CSIR-Neeri study has instead shifted focus to particulate matter (PM), which exceeds emission regulation.
Senior government officials have also flagged huge financial implications of FGD units. ""This data will assess if there is any cost benefit analysis and impact on power tariff,"" the draft report said.
The cost of an FGD system varies from ₹1.25 crore to ₹2.0 crore per megawatt (MW). India's total installed thermal power capacity is expected to be 283 GW by 2030-31.
There are 39 FGD units deployed at 19,430 MW of coal-fired power projects in the country. These FGD units were installed to curb pollution by lowering emission of sulphur dioxide (SO2) from coal-based power plants.

on Thursday said India has made rapid progress building its renewables capacity, but its fast-growing economy and expanding population will drive up carbon-intensive product demand. Moody's expects India to remain one of the fastest growing economies in the world with real GDP growing 7.2 per cent in 2024 and 6.6 per cent in 2025.

The country is likely to sustain similarly high rates of growth over the next decade, it said.
""With a rising population and
industrialization
, this will drive higher energy needs. Increasing household incomes will also bolster demand for energy-intensive products such as automobiles,"" Moody's Ratings said.
India's share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased to 7.5 per cent in 2022, from 6.7 per cent in 2019.
The government's ability to attract private investment and address negative spillovers from decarbonization, including job losses in legacy industries, will determine whether India's credit exposure to carbon transition and social risks rises further, the Moody's report titled Carbon Transition - India said.

India has committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, and some progress has been made toward its 2030 interim decarbonization milestones. But, the country's fast-expanding economy will continue to drive up
GHG emissions
.
India was the world's third-largest GHG emitter as of 2022, but its per capita emissions are still lower than other major economies, highlighting scope for further gains, Moody's said.
Electricity and heating is the highest-emitting sector, while agriculture accounts for 22 per cent of emissions -- double the world average -- partly reflecting methane emissions, with livestock and dairy making significant contributions.
India has expanded its
renewable energy
capacity on the back of strong policy support and private-sector investment. But decarbonization in transportation and the wider economy has been slower. To accelerate the transition, the government is rolling out a compulsory emissions trading mechanism that it plans to formally launch in 2026.
India has high credit exposure to environmental risks, including rising temperature, water stress and pollution.
The country is also highly exposed to social risks, given income inequality, health and safety concerns, and limited access to basic services. Growing climate-related shocks could increasingly impair activity in sectors such as agriculture and informal services, and exacerbate economic and social risks, Moody's said.
Early investment in transition would mitigate these risks, but financing needs will be sizable, it said.
India's private sector bears almost two-thirds of climate mitigation investment currently and is likely to continue to contribute significantly.
The government is unlikely to ramp up spending to close the investment gap given its emphasis on fiscal consolidation, Moody's said.

energy demand growth
than any other country over the next decade due to its large population and rising demand from all sectors, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency. The
World Energy Outlook 2024
report also said that coal will remain a major part of India's energy mix for the next few decades, with the country projected to add about 60 gigawatts of new
coal-fired power capacity
by 2030, even though some older coal plants will retire.
India overtook China in 2023 to become the most populous country in the world, even as its fertility rate dropped below the replacement level.
""The population size and the scale of rising demand from all sectors mean that India is poised to experience more energy demand growth than any other country over the next decade,"" the IEA report said.
According to the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the report said that India is on track to add over 12,000 cars daily to its roads from now until 2035. Built space is expected to increase by over 1 billion square metres annually, which is larger than the total built space in South Africa today.
India's iron and steel production is on track to grow by 70 per cent by 2035, cement output is set to rise by nearly 55 per cent, and the number of air conditioners is projected to increase by more than 4.5 times, resulting in electricity demand from air conditioners exceeding Mexico's total expected electricity consumption by that year.

The total energy demand in India is projected to increase by nearly 35 per cent, and its
electricity generation capacity
is likely to triple to 1,400 GW by 2035.
The IEA said while India is committed to achieving
net zero emissions
by 2070, coal will continue to play a significant role in the energy mix for the next few decades.
India is expected to add about 60 gigawatts of new coal-fired power capacity by 2030, even though some older coal plants will retire. Coal-based electricity generation is projected to increase by over 15 per cent, the report stated.
Coal provided 40 per cent of the energy used in industries like steel, cement, and manufacturing in 2023. By 2035, coal use in industry is expected to grow by 50 per cent, according to the report.
India, the world's second-largest consumer of coal for electricity generation after China, saw the share of coal-fired power generation rise to 75 per cent in 2023-24, up from 71 per cent in 2019-20.
According to the IEA, while coal consumption fell in Europe and the US in 2023, it rose by 8 per cent in India and 5 per cent in China.

"World to move into 'age of electricity' after surplus fossil fuel supplies, IEA says",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/world-to-move-into-age-of-electricity-after-surplus-fossil-fuel-supplies-iea-says/articleshow/114273934.cms,16-10-2024,"The world is on the brink of a new
age of electricity
with fossil fuel demand set to peak by the end of the decade, meaning surplus oil and gas supplies could drive investment into green energy, the
International Energy Agency
said on Wednesday.
But it also flagged a high level of uncertainty as conflicts embroil the oil and gas-producing Middle East and Russia and as countries representing half of global energy demand have elections in 2024.
""In the second half of this decade, the prospect of more ample - or even surplus - supplies of oil and natural gas, depending on how
geopolitical tensions
evolve, would move us into a very different energy world,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release alongside its annual report.
Surplus fossil fuel supplies would likely lead to lower prices and could enable countries to dedicate more resources to clean energy, moving the world into an ""age of electricity,"" Birol said.
In the nearer term, there is also the possibility of reduced supplies should the Middle East conflict disrupt oil flows.

A record high level of clean energy came online globally last year, the IEA said, including more than 560 gigawatts (GW) of
renewable power capacity
. Around $2 trillion is expected to be invested in clean energy in 2024, almost double the amount invested in fossil fuels.
In its scenario based on current government policies,
global oil demand
peaks before 2030 at just less than 102 million barrels/day (mb/d), and then falls back to 2023 levels of 99 mb/d by 2035, largely because of lower demand from the transport sector as electric vehicle use increases.
The report also lays out the likely impact on future oil prices if stricter environmental policies are implemented globally to combat climate change.
In the IEA's current policies scenario, oil prices decline to $75 per barrel in 2050 from $82 per barrel in 2023.
That compares to $25 per barrel in 2050 should government actions fall in line with the goal of cutting energy sector emissions to net zero by then.
Although the report forecasts an increase in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) of 145 billion cubic metres (bcm) between 2023 and 2030, it said this would be outpaced by an increase in export capacity of around 270 bcm over the same period.
""The overhang in LNG capacity looks set to create a very competitive market at least until this is worked off, with prices in key importing regions averaging $6.5-8 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) to 2035,"" the report said.
Asian LNG prices, regarded as an international benchmark are currently around $13 mmBtu.

Imported coal-based power units to run at full steam till Dec 31,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/imported-coal-based-power-units-to-run-at-full-steam-till-dec-31/articleshow/114260624.cms,15-10-2024,"New Delhi: The Centre has extended the direction for imported coal-based
power plants
to run at full capacity till December 31, two senior government officials said. This would ensure adequate capacity amid the continued rise in
power demand
, said a third official.
The power ministry's earlier direction to thermal plants using
imported coal
to operate at full capacity was in force till October 15. Section 11 of the Electricity Act states that the government may, in extraordinary circumstances, ask a power generation company to operate and maintain any station in accordance with its directions. There are 15 such plants in the nation, including
Tata Power
's Coastal Power Gujarat,
Adani Power
Mundra,
Essar Power
Gujarat and
JSW Ratnagiri
.
The power ministry, meanwhile, has not extended the advisory for blending of imported coal for power units, the senior officials said, adding that blending of the fuel will now be on an ""as-required basis"". However, there may be another meeting in mid-November to review the need for blending, one of the persons said.
Both decisions come after an inter-ministerial meeting last week to decide the supply of domestic coal at power plants for the second half of the fiscal.
In June, the government had asked domestic coal-based
thermal power
producers to continue blending imported fuel till October 15, but it reduced the proportion of blending to 4% from 6%.
Coal stocks
at plants, though depleted in the previous quarter, have been close to anticipated levels, as per officials. As on October 14, it was around 34.5 million tonnes (MT), including 3.5 MT at imported coal-based plants and the rest at domestic coal-based units.
Live Events
Coal stock depletion
The depletion of coal stocks at power plants in the last quarter was around 21%, mainly on account of a seasonal drop in coal evacuation and transport and also due to a drop in wind power generation for some time during the period, which increased the use of coal-based power, according to government data and industry executives. However, the depletion of coal stocks in the first quarter, coinciding with high summer demand, was around 7.8%.

""Six resolution plans were received earlier this month and are still being evaluated for compliance under the bankruptcy code. The value of these bids is yet to be ascertained as there could be some to and fro between the resolution professional and creditors,"" said a person aware of the details. All bidders have submitted an initial resolution plan, including a Rs 10 crore deposit.
Separate emails sent to resolution professional Rahul Jindal and all the seven bidders mentioned above did not elicit any response until press time.

Power Finance Corp (Rs 6,553 crore) and its subsidiary Rural Electrification Corp (Rs 5,262 crore) are the top two creditors of the company, which owes total dues of Rs 15,909 crore.
Punjab National Bank
(PNB),
Axis Bank
,
Canara Bank
,
Bank of India
and Life Insurance Corp are other creditors to the company. The plant based in Sinnar special economic zone (SEZ) is nearly 50 km from the city and 4 km from a national highway.
It is a rare power producer readily available in India where building a green field project is both time consuming and costly. Though the plant is now defunct, it has 1,600 acres around it, which means any company buying it can double capacity by adding another 1,350 MW.
However, disputes related to the land, supply of coal and a non-existent power purchase agreement (PPA) could dent valuation for creditors, people familiar with the plant said. ""There are right of way issues and also no railway linkage to the plant. Building a 150 to 200 km rail line will cost hundreds of crores and will have to be factored in by any prospective buyer,"" said a second person aware of the details.
Also, only one unit of 270 MW has achieved commercial operations. The rest of the four units have worked at full load for between three and seven hours only. State-owned MAHAGENCO along with India's largest power producer NTPC could be the dark horses in this bid because the Maharashtra government company runs the 2,190 MW Koradi power plant near Nagpur and can use its existing infrastructure to supply coal and run the plant. MAHAGENCO, with more than 13,000 MW of installed capacity, is the largest state government-owned power producer in India.
Coal has been a major challenge for Sinnar after December 2022, when the South Eastern Coalfields Ltd cancelled the coal supply contract citing non availability of PPA and non commissioning of the majority of units of the plant. Sinnar's PPA with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDC) was cancelled a few years ago.

Central Electricity Authority
Monday.
As per the power ministry, the country's current transmission capacity is about 480,000 circuit km of
transmission lines
.
In the previous plan for five years FY17-FY22, India added 88,865 circuit km of transmission lines and by the end of the period, the total capacity was 460,000 circuit km.
Transmission capacities in the power sector are critical with addition of more generation units and integration of renewable energy. The move comes in the backdrop of the government's big-ticket initiative to ensure 24x7 power for all and increased focus on renewable energy.

Transmission Upgrade
The CEA, which is the planning cell of the power ministry, has divided the projection period into two parts. Between FY27 and FY32, it expects a capacity addition in the transmission sector to the tune of 76,787 circuit km.
In addition, 32,250 MW of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) bi-pole capacity is also planned to be added during the period.
In FY23-27, the projection is for India to add 114,000 circuit km and 1,000 MW of HVDC bi-pole capacity.
At the end of FY27, the expected transmission capacity is likely to be at 570,000 circuit km.
As per the CEA, in FY23, 14,625 circuit km transmission lines were added against the target of 14,581 ckm. In FY24, 14,203 ckm was added against the target of 16,682.
With the projected addition in the decade, the length of transmission lines would reach 648,190 circuit km by the end of FY32. The HVDC bi-pole capacity is likely to increase to 66,750 MW by 2031-32.

bankruptcy resolution
in the power sector involving
Adani Power
's Rs 27,000-crore for the 1,800-MW
KSK Mahanadi
project, the
Supreme Court
on Monday set aside the Telangana High Court’s order that deferred the
insolvency proceedings
against the debt-laden company before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.
A Bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud said that the HC had no jurisdiction to direct deferment of corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of KSK Mahanadi Power (KMP) and also asking for consolidation of insolvency proceedings of the
thermal power
company and its two subsidiaries - KSK Water Infrastructure (KWI) and Raigarh Champa Rail Infrastructure (RCRI).
While allowing the appeal of the
Committee of Creditors
of KSK Mahanadi Power, a public generating company, against the HCs September 10 order, the top court said that it found merit in the lenders’ appeal as the HC had passed the order without issuing notice to the other parties. The HC order had come on a petition filed by the Uttar Pradesh Power Corp (UPPC).
KMP supplies water to the UP power
distribution
company through a pipeline owned by KWI and coal transported through the transportation facility laid down RCRI, which is also undergoing CIRP.
Adani Power has offered the highest bid of Rs 27,000 crore for KSK Mahanadi Power's 1,800-megawatt plant that's undergoing insolvency proceedings. The offer ensures a 92% recovery for the lenders.
Live Events
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for KMP, told the SC that the CIRPs of both KMP and RCRI are at an advanced stage and there cannot be any consolidation of the CIRPs of the three companies at this stage.
The HC order has a grave impact on the resolution of a corporate
debtor
with outstanding debt of Rs 30,000 crore pending since 2019. ""Any delay in resolution will lead to significant loss of public money to the CoC which consists of major financial institutions,"" he argued.
Counsel Pallavi Pratap, appearing for UPPC, contended that the HC had denied any relief to the power distribution company but had directed it to file a plea for clubbing of all the insolvency proceedings before the NCLT.
“The direction as this has a grave impact on the functioning of the Code as well as time bound resolution of a corporate debtor, in one of the oldest pending CIRPs.... the HC did not mention any reasons for granting such an overboard relief to UPPC which shows that the impugned order was passed without any application of mind. This is in flagrant violation of the time bound principle of resolution enshrined under IBC,"" KMP stated in its appeal filed through counsel Sumit Attri.
Other than Adani, KMP had also received plans from Capri Global Holdings,
Coal India
, National Thermal Power Corporation,
Vedanta
, Sajjan Jindal-owned
JSW Energy
, Naveen Jindal-owned Jindal Power and Steel and others.

Bangladesh likely to keep power deal with Adani: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bangladesh-likely-to-keep-power-deal-with-adani-report/articleshow/114138783.cms,11-10-2024,"Bangladesh is likely to set aside
pricing concerns
and retain a
power purchase pact
with India's
Adani Power
, in the face of supply worries and gloomy prospects for a legal challenge, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The new government has set up a panel to gauge whether its predecessor's contracts adequately protected the nation's interests, particularly projects faulted for lack of transparency that were initiated under a special expediting law.
One contract being scrutinised over price concerns is a 2017 deal to buy electricity for 25 years from Adani's $2-billion, 1,600-MW power plant in India's eastern state of Jharkhand that exclusively supplies Bangladesh.
The project meets nearly a tenth of Bangladesh's demand for power, so cancelling the Adani deal outright would be difficult, however, said one of the sources. Both spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter is a sensitive one.
Also, a legal challenge in an international court was likely to fail without strong evidence of wrongdoing, the source added.
Live Events
While an exit may not be possible, the only feasible option could be a mutual agreement to reduce the tariff, the second source said.
Asked for comment on the remarks, Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, the power and energy adviser, or de facto minister in the interim government, said, ""The committee is currently reviewing the matter, and it would be premature to comment.""
The Adani power costs Bangladesh about 12 taka ($0.1008) a unit, an official of the
Bangladesh Power Development Board
said, citing the latest audit report for financial year 2023/24.
That is 27% higher than the rate of India's other private producers and as much as 63% more than Indian state-owned plants, he added.
Under the deal, Bangladesh has been sourcing electricity since April 2023 from Adani, along with about 1,160 MW from other Indian plants.
Adani has had ""no indication"" that Bangladesh is reviewing the agreement, a spokesperson in India said.
""We continue to supply power to Bangladesh despite mounting dues, which are of significant concern and are rendering plant operations unsustainable,"" the spokesperson said.
Dhaka is struggling to clear dues of $800 million to
Adani Power
, among more than $1 billion owed to
Indian power companies
, because of difficulty in accessing dollars to make payment.
""We are in constant dialogue with senior officials of the Bangladesh Power Development Board and the government, who have assured us our dues will be cleared soon,"" the Adani spokesperson added.
Adani Power was confident Dhaka would fulfil its commitments, just as the company had met its contract terms, the spokesperson added, but did not respond to a query on why its rates exceeded those of other suppliers.
Nevertheless, domestic critics, such as the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) of former premier Khaleda Zia, say pricing concerns make a review of the deal necessary.
""The deal with Adani has raised serious concerns about overpricing from the start, and it's a positive step that the government is now reviewing it,"" said senior party leader Zainul Abdin Farroque.
""I hope they make the right decision.""
The interim government led by Nobel laureate
Muhammad Yunus
took power in Bangladesh in August after deadly protests prompted then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to neighbouring India.
It has since scrapped projects such as a floating LNG terminal planned by domestic conglomerate Summit Group, with officials saying more cancellations are possible.

In India, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) will operate 220 MW capacity small nuclear plants for private players who will provide both funding and land for the project, PTI reported recently. The focus initially will be on energy-intensive industries like steel which also need clean energy sources.
Small is beautiful in the new nuclear age
The tech giants are also interested in
small modular reactors
(SMRs), which are more compact and potentially easier to deploy. However, this technology is still in its infancy and lacks regulatory approval, leading companies to seek out existing nuclear power options.
UK-based Rolls-Royce SMR says its SMRs are much cheaper and quicker to get running than standard plants, delivering the kind of
energy security
that many nations are seeking.
SMRs can be factory-built, unlike conventional nuclear reactors that are built on-site. They have a power capacity of up to 300 MWe per unit. Being a mobile and agile technology, SMRs can be set up at locations unsuitable for larger plants. SMRs are seen to be making a significant and meaningful contribution to the
energy transition
phase as part of efforts to deal with the effects of climate change.
India is taking initial steps towards building and deploying SMRs. India aims to deploy 40-50 SMRs, mostly to replace captive thermal power plants, as it aims to achieve the goal of net-zero emissions by 2070. A top industry official has said that the 220-MWe Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) is being redesigned using 3D design platforms with an aim to achieve a high degree of standardisation that would allow easy deployment, even in old thermal power plants used by the steel, aluminium, copper and the cement industries.
The Department of Atomic Energy and Tata Consulting Engineers are redesigning the PHWRs to develop the Bharat Small Modular Reactor.
""We are going to take the old design of the PHWR and then reconfigure and redesign it to be modular, scalable and safety-aligned to post-Fukushima standards,"" Amit Sharma, the managing director and CEO of Tata Consulting Engineers, told PTI in August. Sharma said in the case of SMRs, the plan was to make 40-50 reactors in less than seven to eight years but added that it required a high degree of standardisation, safety and modularity.
Presenting the Union budget in July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that the government would partner with the private sector to set up Bharat Small Reactors and in the research and development of SMRs.
How SMRs can revolutionise India's energy sector
In certain parts of India, the construction of large nuclear power plants (NPPs) is not economically justified, while in others, it is impossible due to territorial features and the lack of power grids. In such cases, SMRs are an excellent option.
India's current installed nuclear power capacity is 6780 MW and it plans to add 21 more atomic power generating units with a total installed capacity of 15,700 MW by 2031.Nuclear power currently comprises 3 per cent of total electricity generation. The government thinks sufficient production and share of atomic energy is essential for ensuring the country's energy security. Current policy targets a three-fold rise in nuclear installed capacity by 2031.
India has set for itself a 500 GW
renewable energy
target by 2030. India has added a record renewable energy capacity of 18.48 GW in 2023-24, which is over 21 per cent higher than 15.27 GW a year ago.
However, industry experts say there is a need to add at least 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for the next six years to meet the ambitious target of 500 GW of renewables by 2030. India's installed renewable energy capacity is 143.64 GW as of March 31, 2024, excluding 47 GW of large hydropower capacity (each plant is more than 25 GW or above). Renewable energy capacity stood at around 190 GW, including large hydro projects, and therefore, India needs to add 310 GW in the next six years or at an average of 50 GW per annum.
In such a scenario, SMRs can revolutionise India's energy sector by not only providing power in far-flung areas but also help meet India its clean energy goals.

Tata Power-DDL issues safety appeal ahead of Dussehra celebrations in Delhi,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/tata-power-ddl-issues-safety-appeal-ahead-of-dussehra-celebrations-in-delhi/articleshow/114088830.cms,09-10-2024,"With Dussehra celebrations just around the corner, the Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (
Tata Power-DDL
) on Wednesday issued a safety appeal to the residents of Delhi, urging them to refrain from
burning effigies
near electrical installations. In a statement, the company highlighted the serious safety risks associated with burning effigies in proximity to electrical installations and overhead power lines, saying such actions could lead to

India's coal-fired monthly power output slips consecutively for the first time since pandemic,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-coal-fired-monthly-power-output-slips-consecutively-for-the-first-time-since-pandemic/articleshow/114068048.cms,09-10-2024,"India's
coal-fired power
output fell for a second straight month in September on an annual basis due to slower growth in electricity use and a surge in
solar generation
, a Reuters review of data from the federal grid regulator showed.
The decline reflects a shift in fuel use patterns in the world's fastest growing major economy and third-largest greenhouse gas emitter. It follows 47 straight months of year-over-year growth in coal use for power generation.
Electricity use in India has been rising since the pandemic due to a surging economy as well as heatwaves. However, higher rainfall during this year's monsoon reduced air-conditioning demand and weighed on
power consumption
, analysts say.
Total power generated from plants running on coal and lignite fell 5.8% annually in September and 4.9% in August, data from state-run Grid-India showed, compared with a 10% growth during the first seven months of the year.
Slowing growth in overall power demand, which grew 1.1% year-over-year during the September quarter compared with a 9.7% increase during the first half of the year, has helped the country reduce coal use.

Heavy September rainfall in the west and north resulted in lower power demand, CRISIL, a unit of ratings agency S&P, said in a recent note.
Meanwhile, higher installations boosted solar power generation up by 26.4% annually in September - the highest rate of growth in 12 months - pushing the share of
renewable energy
in India's electricity output to a record high of 13.9% during the quarter.
Higher rainfall in key states also helped cut the share of coal-fired power during the quarter to the lowest in two years, as it helped hydropower generation grow more than 26% in September from the same month a year ago.
An 18.5% rise in nuclear power generation during the quarter was also among the factors that helped reduce dependence on coal to 67.2% of total generation, the Grid-India data showed.
Lower coal dependence weighed on imports of the fuel, which fell 6.1% in September, the steepest rate of decline in 12 months, data from consultancy Bigmint showed.
Coal production and supply during the September quarter by state-run
Coal India
, the world's largest coal miner which accounts for nearly 80% of the country's domestic output, fell at the fastest rate since the June 2020 quarter, data on its website showed.
Still, industry officials expect economic growth to lift power demand. Fitch analysts expect power demand to grow 8% in 2024, compared with a gain of 6.5% in 2023, mainly driven by industrial growth and overall economic activity.

While power demand rose between 11% and 15% in April-June on account of sweltering heat, July onwards demand has hovered between a fall of 5% year-on-year to a rise of 3.5%.
The coal stock at power plants as on October 4 was around 36 million tonnes, including 3.6 million tonnes at imported coal-based power plants.
The depletion of
coal stocks
in the last quarter was around 21%, which is mainly on account of seasonal drop in coal evacuation and transport and also because of a drop in wind power generation for some time in the period, which increased the use of coal-based power, according to government data and industry officials.
Whereas, the depletion of coal stocks in the first quarter, which also saw high summer demand was around 7.8%.
Former coal secretary Amrit Lal Meena had told ET in August that the ministry was expecting 34 million tonnes of coal stocks at domestic coal-based power plants by September-end. The same was recorded at 32.8 million tonnes as on September 30.

NPCIL to operate small nuclear plants for private players,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/npcil-to-operate-small-nuclear-plants-for-private-players/articleshow/113984689.cms,06-10-2024,"In a first, the
Nuclear Power Corporation of India
(
NPCIL
) will operate 220 MW capacity
small nuclear plants
for private players who will provide both funding and land for the project, a senior government official has said.
A development on this front is likely by this year-end or early 2025, the official told PTI.
""The funding and land for the nuclear plant will be made available by the private player but the plant will be managed by NPCIL,"" the official said.
With the NPCIL, a public sector enterprise under the Department of Atomic Energy, managing and operating the plant, the need to amend the Atomic Energy Act will not arise. Under the Atomic Energy Act, the
nuclear energy
sector is open only for government PSUs, another official said.
These 220 MW reactors will be known as '
Bharat Small Reactors
' for which research is already in progress at the
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
(BARC), the official said.

The
Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor
(PHWR) technology, which India has mastered over a period of time, is likely to be used for building the small reactors, the official said.
With small reactors, the exclusion zone can be brought down to 500 metres, the official said. Currently the exclusion zone varies from 1 to 1.5 kilometres.
The focus initially will be on energy intensive industries like steel.
Many of the private players have their own captive plants and small reactors could in future replace them, the official said.
Presenting the Union Budget in July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the government will partner with the private sector to set up Bharat Small Reactors and in the research and development of
small modular reactors
. She did not elaborate further.
Although foreign players have approached India for building smaller reactors, the estimated price quoted by them is really high, officials pointed out.
The cost per MW for building a small modular reactor in collaboration with foreign players could go to around Rs 100 crore per megawatt. However, with PWHR technology, it can be done at Rs 16 crore per MW, another official said.
More importantly, there are very few small modular reactors that are currently operational in the world.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), there are more than 80 SMR (small modular reactors) designs and concepts globally. Most of them are in various developmental stages and some are claimed as being near-term deployable.
There are currently four SMRs in advanced stages of construction in Argentina, China and Russia, and several existing and newcomer nuclear energy countries are conducting SMR research and development.
The PHWR is a technology India mastered especially after sanctions post the 1974 nuclear tests. It started from 200 MW, ramping it to 220 MW, 540 MW and then to 700 MW.
In 2017, the government gave a nod to start 10 nuclear plants of 700 MW each.
The NPCIL operates 24
nuclear power
plants of which 18 are
Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors
. Of the 18 plants, 14 are of 220 MW capacity, two are 540 MW one is 200 MW capacity, as per the NPCIL.
It operates two 700 MW plants at Kakrapar in Gujarat.
The NPCIL also operates two Boiling Water Reactors with 160 MW each capacity and two 1000 MW Light Water Reactors.
Small Modular Reactors can be factory-built, unlike conventional nuclear reactors that are built on-site. They have a power capacity of up to 300 MW per unit.
Being a mobile and agile technology, SMRs can be set up at locations unsuitable for larger plants.
The SMRs are seen to be making a significant and meaningful contribution to the energy transition phase as part of efforts to deal with the effects of climate change.
The push for nuclear power, which is considered to be a cleaner fuel or non-fossil fuel, comes in the backdrop of India's ambitious net zero goals.
India has installed nuclear power capacity of 7,480 MW, which is expected to increase to 22,480 MW by 2031.

Huge funds, new debt-free status reignite long-lost hopes",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/anil-ambani-led-reliance-groups-rs-17600-crore-fundraise-to-drive-future-growth-plans/articleshow/113982823.cms,06-10-2024,"Two of Anil Ambani-owned Reliance companies could soon be looking at a significant turnaround in their fortunes on a number of recent good news, likely paving the path for the beleaguered former tycoon to find a way to be back in business, reports have said.
Reliance Infrastructure
and
Reliance Power
, part of the troubled businessman's
Reliance Group
, are set to double down on fresh growth strategies after securing Rs 17,600 crore in fundraising and achieving a zero-debt status, news agency PTI reported on October 6 citing company officials.
In recent weeks, the companies raised Rs 4,500 crore through preferential equity shares and an additional Rs 7,100 crore from global investment fund
Varde Partners
. This investment comes in the form of equity-linked foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) with a 10-year maturity and a low 5% interest rate.
Both companies plan to raise another Rs 6,000 crore via qualified institutional placement (QIP), with each targeting Rs 3,000 crore.
According to a senior group official, this strategy will provide essential growth capital. ""Reliance Group's strategy of raising capital through equity or equity-linked long-term bonds will offer the group companies essential growth capital for their expansion plans,"" the official said.
Live Events
The move will potentially allow a total investment outlay of Rs 50,000 crore for future business plans. Both companies aim to boost their net worth to around Rs 25,000 crore.
The fundraising includes Rs 4,500 crore from preferential equity shares, with Rs 1,750 crore invested by promoters and Rs 3,750 crore from four major investors: Fortune Financial & Equities Services, Florintree Innovations LLP, Authum Investment and Infrastructure, and Sanatan Financial Advisory.
Even with a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30, raising over Rs 17,000 crore in equity or equity-linked bonds will provide the group companies with a total investment outlay of Rs 50,000 crore for their future business plans over the next few years, calculations show.
Varde Partners' investment of Rs 7,100 crore in FCCBs is also a crucial part of their funding strategy.
According to PTI's report, the equity-linked FCCBs have a long maturity period of 10 years and a low interest rate of 5 per cent.
Company officials told the news agency that these steps were a clear sign of strong financial support for the growth plans of the two companies in question.

In response to ET’s questions, Novak said, “We are always open to discussing new energy projects with our long–time friends (India) - be it mining projects, processing or marketing and power generation.”
“At the same time, you know that while commercial negotiations are underway, it is premature to disclose their details and plans. Agreements on specific projects will be announced as they are achieved and the transition to practical implementation,” he said.
India is one of Russia’s key partners in the energy sector, he added. “We note the high dynamics of trade turnover. This year, Russia ranks first among oil suppliers to India, updating supply records.”
More than 5,300 participants from 81 countries took part in the forum with the largest delegations from China, Venezuela, Iran, the UAE, and South Africa.
The list of the Russian companies with a presence in India include Uralmash, Gazprom, Rosatom, Silovye Mashiny, and BrahMos Aerospace.

Delhi govt to audit DISCOMs on pension surcharge issue,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhi-govt-to-audit-discoms-on-pension-surcharge-issue/articleshow/113881643.cms,02-10-2024,"Delhi Chief Minister
Atishi
has ordered a special audit of power companies to look into the
pension surcharge
issue, an official statement said on Wednesday. To be conducted by auditors approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the move aims to ensure greater transparency in the pension process of the
Delhi Vidyut Board
(DVB), it said.
The
DISCOMs
charge a pension surcharge of seven per cent from power consumers in their monthly bills. The surcharge is calculated as a percentage of the amount of fixed and energy cost portion of the bill.
Emphasising the government's commitment towards the welfare of pensioners, Atishi stated that the well-being of DVB pensioners was a top priority. The audit is expected to bring accountability and clarity to the funding and distribution of
pension benefits
, ensuring that pensioners receive the support they deserve.
The chief minister has directed the
Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission
(DERC) to conduct a special audit of all
electricity distribution companies
(DISCOMs) in the national capital to safeguard the pension benefits of more than 20,000 pensioners of the DVB and increase transparency, the statement said.
The main objective of this audit is to track funds collected as pension surcharge and ensure that they are being properly utilised for the funding of pensions and related benefits for the retired employees of the DVB, it said.

Through the central public sector undertaking scheme for
renewable energy
, the company has diversified into solar power projects. It is going to soon commission its own solar projects totalling around 1,378 MW with another 1,545 MW in the pipeline to be commissioned in the next 4-5 years.
Of the projects in the pipeline, one is a 300 MW floating solar project in Odisha.
The Cabinet last month approved the power ministry's proposal for central financial assistance to the northeastern states for up to 24% equity stake in hydro power projects to be developed through a joint venture with the Centre. The scheme came with an outlay of ₹4,136 crore to be implemented between FY25 and FY32.
Chaudhary said because of the decision, there will be ease in
land acquisition
and maintaining law and order, among other benefits, because states will have the ownership in the projects.
The government has also recently included the development of railway siding and transmission lines from hydro projects to nearest substation as part of a scheme, unlike earlier when they used to be added to the project cost under a separate cost head, he said.
Insurance issues
Chaudhary said that insurance premiums for hydro power projects have risen in the last couple of years because of the rise in natural calamities. Many of the co-insurers are now hesitating to insure, especially hydro projects or irrigation projects, because of natural calamities, he added.

The ministry also estimated that peak power demand may hit 260 GW this summer.
Experts said the widespread above-normal rainfall in the country reduced the use of cooling appliances like air conditioners and desert coolers.
This led to a decline in power consumption as well as growth in power demand in the country in September, they said.
The demand for power and consumption will continue to be steady in the coming days due to the end of the Monsoon season and more industrial and commercial activities in the country due to festivities, they added.

NCLAT upholds tribunal’s order of Sarda Energy’s acquisition of SKS Power Generation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nclat-upholds-tribunals-order-of-sarda-energys-acquisition-of-sks-power-generation/articleshow/113850472.cms,01-10-2024,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
) has upheld the tribunal’s order to approve the
SKS Power Generation
(Chattisgarh) Ltd’s acquisition by BSE-listed
Sarda Energy
& Minerals Ltd (SEML).
The unsuccessful bidders of SKS Power Generation (Chattisgarh) including
Torrent Power Ltd
,
Jindal Power Ltd
and Vantage Point Asset Management Pte. had approached the appellate tribunal to challenge the lower tribunal’s order.
“We do not find that any sufficient grounds have been made out within the meaning of Section 61(3)(ii) of the
IBC
to interfere with the decision of the adjudicating authority (NCLT) approving the resolution plan of Sarda, in these appeals filed by unsuccessful resolution applicant,” observed the bench preceded by Justice Ashok Bhushan and technical members Barun Mitra and Arun Baroka.
On August 13, Mumbai’s National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the SKS Power Generation (Chattisgarh) Ltd’s acquisition by SEML. SKS Power Generation (Chattisgarh) Ltd has admitted liabilities of over Rs 2,697 crore, while the successful bidder’s resolution plan proposed to pay about Rs 2,000 crore to acquire the company.
Originally, in April 2022, the company was admitted under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in an application filed by its lender Bank of Baroda. Before the tribunal’s approval, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) led by the
State Bank of India
and the
Bank of Baroda
approved the resolution plan with 100% voting in favour of Sarda Energy & Minerals.
Live Events
In this case, Sarda Energy & Minerals was represented by the law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan and Agarwal Law Associates, and the company’s RP and the Committee of Creditors (CoC) were represented by law firm Trilegal and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, respectively.
Subsequently, the unsuccessful bidders approached the appellate tribunal to challenge the NCLT’s order.
The unsuccessful bidders argued through their counsel that the resolution professional (RP) and the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of the company ‘selectively permitted’ the successful resolution applicant (SEML) to modify its commercial offer after the conclusion of the negotiation process on April 19, 2023.
“The case underscores the importance of transparency and adherence to the IBC framework, with the judiciary playing a limited role in interfering with the CoC’s decisions unless material irregularities are evident,” said Akshat Khetan, founder of AU Corporate & Legal Advisory Services. “The outcome reinforces the IBC’s objective to ensure timely resolution and maximize asset value.
SKS Power Generation (Chhattisgarh) set up a coal-based thermal power plant at Binjkote and Durramuda in the Raigarh District of Chhattisgarh. The facility is in high demand because it is a rare working power plant available for sale with 25 years of fuel agreement accompanying a railway line.
The thermal power project consists of 4X300 MW capacity power generating units, utilizing Indian coal as the main fuel. The company is currently in the midst of the execution of Phase II 2X300 MW capacity, according to its website.

India needs more time for transition from coal: Experts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-needs-more-time-for-transition-from-coal-experts/articleshow/113802603.cms,30-09-2024,"New Delhi: As the UK officially shut down its last remaining
coal power plant
on Monday, policy experts said coal will continue to be a part of India's energy mix for the next few decades, given that it is still a developing country with significant energy needs. The UK on Monday closed its last
coal power
plant, becoming the first G7 nation to do so amid calls for a global coal-free energy system by 2040.
The world's first coal power plant opened in London in 1882, and until 2012, coal accounted for 39 per cent of the UK's electricity generation.
Global energy think tank Ember said the closure of the UK's last coal plant means that more than a third of OECD countries are now coal-free, with three-quarters expected to eliminate coal power by 2030, in line with global climate goals aimed at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The International Energy Agency's (IEA) ""Net Zero by 2050"" report recommends that developed countries phase out unabated coal by 2030, while developing countries should aim to do so by 2040 to remain on track for global net-zero emissions by 2050.
The term ""unabated"" in this context refers to electricity production that does not use technologies designed to capture and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

These developments occur as developed countries push developing countries to accelerate the phase-down of unabated coal power.
India, the world's second-largest consumer of coal for electricity generation after China, saw the share of coal-fired power generation rise to 75 per cent in 2023-24 from 71 per cent in 2019-20.
According to the IEA, while coal consumption fell in Europe and the US in 2023, it rose by 8 per cent in India and 5 per cent in China.
That said, India's coal usage for power generation began several decades later than that of developed nations. While the UK's first coal power plant opened in 1882, India established its first major
thermal power
plant, the Hussain Sagar Thermal Power Station in Hyderabad, in 1920.
Policy experts say India is focusing on a long-term energy transition, where coal will continue to be part of the energy mix for the next few decades.
Sunil Dahiya, an independent analyst, said that while coal will not disappear in the near future, India must reduce harmful emissions from the sector by deploying advanced air pollution control technologies and improving efficiency to curb carbon emissions.
According to climate activist Harjeet Singh, India has made remarkable progress in renewable energy, but the intermittent nature of these sources and the lack of scalable battery storage mean that coal still underpins its power supply and industries like steel and cement.
""Yet, the cost of coal goes far beyond emissions -- it destroys ecosystems, displaces communities, and deepens environmental injustice. India must urgently shift away from coal, and the international community must provide the financial and technological support needed for a just transition -- for both people and the planet,"" he said.
Labanya Jena, a sustainable finance specialist at global think tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said achieving 100 per cent renewable energy deployment in India's energy mix quickly poses significant challenges.
""We need to reduce the cost of energy storage, make it easier to acquire land for RE projects, address social challenges associated with green economic transition, and make capital available at a reasonable rate.
However, rapid RE deployment can help India decarbonize its energy system while balancing economic and energy security needs,"" he said.
Montek Singh Ahluwalia, former deputy chairman of the erstwhile Planning Commission, said in a webinar organized by the think tank Centre for Social and Economic Progress last week that India can't cut down coal immediately and it is hypocritical in the West to focus solely on coal while ignoring oil and natural gas.
""However, if we are going to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, we must recognise that we need to phase out thermal power.We should indicate to the world that India's emissions will increase for a while, then peak, and eventually decline. Right now, there's a lot of misunderstanding in the West about India's willingness to reduce emissions,"" he said.
Sunita Narain, the director general of the Centre for Science and Environment, echoed this sentiment, saying that India is currently dependent on coal, as it remains the cheapest form of energy available.
""We need to talk about a different future for coal. We must clean up coal -- not just for climate change but also for local air pollution. We will still need to invest, and that's where the world needs a conversation.""
India has repeatedly emphasised that it is still a developing country with significant energy needs and that coal remains a crucial part of its energy mix because it is a reliable and affordable source of electricity.
It argues that developed countries have historically contributed more to greenhouse gas emissions, having relied on fossil fuels for their economic development. Therefore, developed nations should take the lead in reducing emissions while allowing developing countries more time to transition to cleaner energy sources.
India's Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav had said earlier that the country is committed to meeting the energy needs of its population and ""will also have to rely on coal power until it achieves developed country status"".
He said the nation cannot solely depend on ""importing oil and gas"" to meet its energy demands.

Adani Electricity
Mumbai has entered into a business transfer agreement with its wholly owned subsidiary North Maharashtra Power Limited for carving out ADTPS by way of a slump sale on a going concern basis. Dahanu Power Plant is a 500 MW coal-fired power project located in Maharashtra.
Adani Energy Solutions
(AESL), formerly
Adani Transmission Ltd
, had this July carved out the Dahanu power plant from the company’s books. This carving out, the company had said this July, is done to honor the company's environment, social, and governance (ESG) norms. The move is expected to attract a fresh set of ESG-focused investors.
""This will place AESL closer to its aspiration to be amongst the top 20 global companies in ESG ratings amongst the global utility industry,"" the company had said on July 25. AESL had recorded an exceptional loss of Rs 1,506.02 crore on account of carving out of the Dahanu power plant from the company’s books and in line with IND AS 105, it had said in a press statement.
""AEML has approved the transaction for carving the said power plant to one of the related party...at a transaction price of Rs 815 crore, against the book value of Rs 2,321.02 crore and hence Rs 1506 crore has been charged in the statement of profit and loss as an exceptional item,"" the company had said, adding that the transaction is subject to requisite regulatory approval.
AESL inherited the Dahanu Thermal Power plant as part of its acquisition of the Mumbai distribution business in 2017, from Anil Ambani-led

UPPCL's plea may delay KSK Mahanadi resolution process,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/uppcls-plea-may-delay-ksk-mahanadi-resolution-process/articleshow/113715593.cms,27-09-2024,"Mumbai: In a move that could delay the biggest bankruptcy resolution in the power sector involving
Adani Power
's Rs 27,000-crore offer for the
KSK Mahanadi
project, the Uttar Pradesh power utility has sought the consolidation of insolvency proceedings of the debt-laden thermal power company and its two subsidiaries to ""protect the interests of multiple stakeholders"", an industry source told ET.
The Uttar Pradesh Power Corp (
UPPCL
) filed a writ petition in the
Telangana High Court
on clubbing the resolution processes of the 1,800-MW KSK Mahanadi and its two subsidiaries - KSK Water Infrastructure and Raigarh Champa Rail Infrastructure.
""The high court has deferred the CIRP process on September 20,"" said the source cited above.
PwC
's Resolution Professional (RP) Sumit Binani and the Committee of Creditors (CoC) now plan to appeal the decision before a division bench. If
Adani Power
's resolution plan is approved, lenders stand to recover 92% of their outstanding loans.
""Now, the RP and CoC will go to the appeal court division bench,"" said the source.
Live Events
UPPCL's petition argues that the failure to consolidate the resolution processes of KSK Mahanadi, KSK Water Infrastructure, and Raigarh Champa Rail Infrastructure will not be in the interests of creditors and other stakeholders. UPPCL sought an order from the Telangana High Court to mandate consolidation to ensure a ""fair, transparent, and efficient resolution process"".
Medha Servo Drives
, which offered to pay almost all dues of lenders for Raigarh Champa Rail Infrastructure and KSK Water Infrastructure, the two ancillary companies critical for operating the 1,800 MW plant, has received the highest requisite vote, ET reported on August 24.
Adani Power's Rs 27,000 crore bid for KSK Mahanadi was the highest bid amongst other competing offers from
Capri Global
,
NTPC
,
JSW Energy
,
Vedanta
, and Jindal Steel & Power, among others. The deal is not yet approved by the CoC and with UPPCL's writ petition introducing a potential legal hurdle, the voting of the bids will be delayed further. Lenders have appointed
Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas
law firm while RP Sumit Binani has appointed
Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas
to take legal opinions on bids.
Lenders have filed claims of Rs 29,330 crore against KSK Mahanadi. Some banks, including
SBI
, have sold their debt to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) in order to recover part of their dues as the CIRP process has been delayed for a long time. As a result ARCs now control 54.4% of the verified claims.

Uranium rich Kazakhstan to hold referendum next week on nuclear power plant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/uranium-rich-kazakhstan-to-hold-referendum-next-week-on-nuclear-power-plant/articleshow/113670458.cms,25-09-2024,"Uranium-rich Kazakhstan has the necessary technological capabilities and adequate natural resources to build a
nuclear power plant
, said Gulmira Mursalova, deputy director of the atomic industry department at the Kazakh Energy Ministry.
Kazakhstan will hold a referendum on the construction of a
nuclear power
plant on October 6. According to a survey conducted by the Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies, more than half of surveyed Kazakh citizens are prepared to participate in the upcoming referendum.
Kazakhstan is a key supplier of
uranium
to India.
The country has sufficient uranium reserves and produces finished fuel in the form of fuel pellets. Today, Kazakhstan’s explored uranium reserves total 900,000 tons. Also, Kazakhstan holds high positions in terms of research, reported the Khabar TV channel.
Mursalova said that if a nuclear power plant is built, Kazakhstan will have enough nuclear fuel to cover all its needs.

“We have the right technology to build a nuclear power plant in accordance with French or Chinese technologies. Regarding technologies from South Korea or Russia, for instance, they will be a little bit different and include more lines. We do not have two stages, conversion and enrichment of uranium. However, the President noted in his address last year that it is necessary to deal with this question,” she said.

energy security
. Announced by Union minister Manohar Lal during a press conference in New Delhi, the National
Electricity Plan
2023 to 2032 outlines an ambitious framework to scale India's
transmission network
and capacity to meet a projected peak demand of 458 GW by 2032.
""Our power infrastructure is pivotal to national security and economic stability,"" stated Manohar Lal. ""The new electricity plan is a proactive measure to ensure we are well-prepared to meet future demands and incorporate emerging technologies like
renewable energy
and
green hydrogen
into our grid.""
According to the plan, the transmission network in the country is set to expand from 4.85 lakh circuit kilometers (ckm) in 2024 to 6.48 lakh ckm by 2032, with the transformation capacity projected to rise from 1,251 GVA to 2,342 GVA. The Union Minister detailed that these enhancements are crucial for accommodating the increasing electricity demands and for supporting the integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources into the national grid.
Additionally, the minister announced the approval of 50 GW of
Inter-State Transmission System
(ISTS) capacity designed to evacuate 280 GW of VRE by 2030. ""So far, 42 GW of this capacity has been completed, with 85 GW under construction and 75 GW currently in the bidding phase. The remaining 82 GW will be approved in due course,"" he added.
During the 100-day period, transmission schemes corresponding to 50.9 GW capacity were also approved, totaling an estimated investment of ₹60,676 crore. These schemes will facilitate the evacuation of renewable electricity across several states including Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan, enhancing the national grid's capacity to handle renewable outputs from large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia projects.

India's power sector has potential of Rs 40 trillion investment over next decade: Motilal Oswal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-sector-has-potential-of-rs-40-trillion-investment-over-next-decade-motilal-oswal/articleshow/113625952.cms,24-09-2024,"Power sector in India holds investment opportunities estimated upwards of Rs 40 trillion over the next decade, brokerage
Motilal Oswal
asserted in a report.
Of those estimated Rs 40 trillion investment potential, Rs 34 trillion is expected in capital expenditure and the rest in optionality, with the generation, transmission, and smart metering accounting for an estimated 86 per cent, 10 per cent, and 4 per cent.
The tailwinds driving this ""mammoth"" investment are power demand accelerating at a higher CAGR, upgrading or replacing old power infrastructure as the electricity mix undergoes a shift, and transitioning to cleaner energy sources.
The report said India is a unique case where burgeoning real GDP/per capita growth, technology upgrades and electrification are all strong undercurrents and could continue to drive power demand higher for years to come.
""With a robust GDP growth outlook for India and the emergence of new demand drivers (
electric vehicles
, data centers, electrification of energy demand), we believe power consumption in India can compound at 7 per cent+ over the next decade (currently 8-9 per cent),"" Motilal Oswal said.

By 2035, electric vehicles and data centers are set to drive one-third of
power demand growth
in India, the brokerage report asserted.
Electric vehicles (EVs) and data centers account for a negligible share of power demand in India today. ""Yet, by 2035, we estimate one-third of power demand growth might be attributable to these two sectors,"" the report read.
India's current primary energy and
electricity consumption
trends closely mirror those of China in the early 2000s.
Like China, Motilal Oswal believes power consumption in India is at an inflection point given the expectation for India to grow by 6.5-7 per cent over the next decade, and can comfortably compound at 7-7.5 per cent over the next 10 years versus 5 per cent CAGR in the past two decades.
At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part ""
Panchamrit
"" pledge. They included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India as a whole also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070.

Thermal capacities needed till RE supply matches demand: Power Minister,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/thermal-capacities-needed-till-re-supply-matches-demand-power-minister/articleshow/113608630.cms,23-09-2024,"There is a need to continue with installation of new
thermal capacities
as the supply of green power is not in line with demand, Union Minister Manohar Lal said on Monday. He also said that any call on reducing installation of thermal capacities can only be taken after 2030.
The union
power minister
made the remarks at an event to brief 100-day achievements of the Modi-3.0 government in the national capital.
""Till the supply of
renewable energy
does not matches the demand, it seems necessary to increase the capacity of thermal plant in the country, and reduce its installation gradually. But till 2030-35, We have to take these (thermal projects) ahead,"" Lal said.
The government is looking to set up an additional 80 GW coal-based capacity by 2031-32.
According to Power Secretary Pankaj Agarwal, in 100 days of the present government, 12800 MW or 12.8 GW capacity has been awarded for construction, while 28 GW is under progress.
Live Events
The minister further said that the
National Electricity Plan
2023-32 will be launched in next 15 days.
Roadmap has been prepared to achieve the 425 GW peak demand by 2030 and 458 GW by 2032. Under the new plan, the transmission network will be increased from 4.85 lakh ckm in 2024 to 6.48 lakh ckm by 2032.
The government will also increase transformer capacity to 2342 GVA (gigavolt-ampere) from 1251 GVA, Lal said adding that an investment of Rs 9.15 lakh crore will be needed for these development works.
India has a potential of 184 GW of pumped storage projects (PSPs). Around 4.7 GW have already been installed, 6.47 GW is under construction and 60 GW under process of survey and investigation.

Tata Power-DDL gets patent for transformer life-enhancing device,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/tata-power-ddl-gets-patent-for-transformer-life-enhancing-device/articleshow/113602597.cms,23-09-2024,"Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd on Monday said it has received a
patent
for self-regenerating
transformer breather
for 20 years. The 'Self-Regenerating Breather' is a device protecting a transformer from
moisture ingress
and thus, increases the longevity of
electric transformers
, the company said in a statement.
According to the statement, Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (
Tata Power-DDL
), a leading power utility supplying electricity to over 2 million customers in North Delhi, has been granted the patent for its unique
self-regenerating
transformer breather for a term of 20 years.
The patented technology is also expected to reduce the maintenance man-days for replacement of Silica gel in a transformer's breather to protect it from moisture damage, the statement said.
With the new technology, Silica gel will be required to be checked or replaced only during the transformer maintenance schedule, which is generally once in two years. In contrast, in the conventional design, Silica gel needs to be replaced 4-6 times before a maintenance schedule of 2 years, it said.
Tata Power DDL's Engineering team developed and successfully tested the 'self-regenerating breather' in December 2015, it said.
Live Events
The pilot installation of 20 breathers was done in 2016-17, which showed remarkable results. The company filed for a patent of 'self-regenerating breather' technology in 2016.
The moisture in the air can cause outages and shorten the life of a transformer. The new technology utilises waste heat from the top plate of the transformer to minimise moisture content in the air inlet to the distribution transformer (DT) Breather.
Tata Power-DDL Chief Executive Officer Gajanan S Kale said in the statement, ""This patent is yet another example of our tech edge, which will make our power supply infra ready for difficult weather conditions.""

Adani Energy Solutions valued at $18.5 billion; revenue to grow 20%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-energy-solutions-valued-at-18-5-billion-revenue-to-grow-20/articleshow/113566566.cms,22-09-2024,"Adani Energy Solutions
Ltd, power transmission utility of the Adani group, is valued at USD 18.5 billion at enterprise level and a strong business growth is likely to propel a 29 per cent compounded growth in its pre-tax profits over the next three years, a report said.
AESL
has a diversified portfolio that includes transmission assets, distribution assets, and a
smart metering
business.
""With an enterprise value of USD 18.5 billion, we believe AESL to be a very attractive way to play the rapidly expanding
energy markets
in India,"" global brokerage
Cantor
Fitzgerald said, initiating coverage of the company.
It believes AESL offers growth unlike any other publicly traded utility/energy company across US, Europe, or Asia. ""We forecast total revenue to grow at a CAGR of 20 per cent from FY24 to FY27 and adjusted EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 28.8 per cent.""
This compares to peers growing revenue at low single digits and EBITDA at mid-single digits.
Stating that it is growing meaningfully faster than its peers, the brokerage said it believes AESL is a more diversified business.
Live Events
""We expect its
transmission business
will see strong growth as it completes the nine projects it has recently been awarded over the next 18-24 months (and we expect it to win more contracts over the coming years), its
distribution business
should be able to grow at/near double-digit rates as it continues to add to its regulatory asset base (RAB), and its smart metering business is just about to start generating meaningful revenue/profits as it works through its 22.8 million smart meter backlog (to generate USD 3.2 billion of income), and it could win another 40 million smart meters (which will add another USD 6 billion+ of income),"" it said.
It saw robust growth over the next four years as AESL will continue to outgrow peers for at least the next decade.
This, it said, is a result of India being still underdeveloped relative to more mature markets, and as it develops and uses/needs more electricity, AESL's transmission and distribution businesses will stand to benefit.
""Following a recent capital raise (which was meaningfully oversubscribed by 3x), it is now well-funded to drive growth across all three major segments,"" Cantor said, adding AESL shares currently trade at a 60 per cent discount to peers.
AESL was formed when Adani Enterprises demerged transmission assets into a new entity named Adani Transmissions in 2015. Adani Transmissions then acquired distribution assets from Reliance Infrastructure in 2018 and acquired distribution assets from MPSEZ Utilities in 2021.
It announced it was entering the smart metering industry in 2022 and formed a new cooling solutions business in 2023, which ultimately led the company to rename itself to Adani Energy Solutions, as it now has a much broader portfolio relative to being a pure play transmission/distribution company.
In AESL's most recent fiscal year FY24 (April 2023 to March 2024), its transmission business accounted for 28.4 per cent of revenue and 52.6 per cent of EBITDA, while its distribution business accounted for 71.6 per cent of revenue and 36.3 per cent of EBITDA.
Its business is linked to India needing more electrification infrastructure. India is home to 1.4 billion people and is the most populous country in the world. ""We still believe India as a nation is only just beginning when it comes to energy demand,"" it said.
As more homes connect to the grid, incomes rise and those homes are filled with more products that use electricity (refrigerators, AC, etc.), the demand for electricity will only increase.
To meet this growing demand, India has heavily invested and promoted renewable energy. As more electricity is generated from renewables, infrastructure to transmit and distribute that electricity will only become more important, and that is entirely where AESL lies.

The successful achievement of criticality of RAPP-7, after the smooth operation of KAPS 3&4, the first two 700 MWe PHWRs, demonstrates the maturity achieved by NPCIL in the design, construction and operation of the indigenous reactors.
First criticality marks the completion of the construction phase and commencement of the operation phase of a nuclear power plant.
Various experiments and tests will now be conducted before connecting it to the grid.
Thereafter, the level will be raised in steps to full power, in line with the clearances of the AERB.
The RAPP 7&8 project is being set up in Rawatbhata, where six units with a total capacity of 1,180 MWe are already in operation.
NPCIL currently operates 24 reactors with a total capacity of 8,180 MWe and has eight units (including RAPP-7) with a capacity of 6,800 MWe under construction.
In addition, 10 more reactors with a total capacity of 7,000 MWe are in pre-project phase and are expected to be completed progressively by 2031-32.

News of the potential deal comes after Kenya confirmed the India-listed conglomerate is seeking another 30-year concession to run the nation’s biggest airport. Many Kenyans were angered by that proposal, saying it flouted procurement laws and was shrouded in secrecy to avoid scrutiny.
Transport Secretary Davis Chirchir has told lawmakers that privately initiated proposal is still going through an evaluation process.
Kenya has a financing gap of $5 billion, or about $250 million annually, for power lines and can no longer rely on the National Treasury to fund new links, Mativo said. This year alone, it’s suffered two national outages, he said.

Adani Group says they have not issued any press releases related to Kenya
“We have a grid that has improved, but it’s not where it’s supposed to be,” he said.
Adani’s proposal includes construction of a new 206 kilometer Gilgil-Thika-Malaa-Konza line, another 95 kilometers linking Rongai-Keringet-Chemosit and approximately 98 kilometers for the Menengai-Ol Kalou-Rumuruti conduit.
Adani is looking at an 11.5% cost of debt and a 16% equity internal rate of return. Ketraco, for its part, wants a lower 9.5% cost of debt and 14% IERR, according to Mativo.
In a separate arrangement, a joint venture of Africa50 — an infrastructure investment unit of the African Development Bank - along with state-backed Power Grid Corp of India, have submitted a proposal to build 273 kilometers of power lines in Kenya.

A separate plan by the Kenyan government to lease the country's main international to the Adani Group has sparked anger among Kenyans and also triggered a strike by the country's aviation workers.
The plan involves leasing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to the Adani Group for 30 years, in exchange for $1.85 billion of investment by Adani into the airport's expansion.
Adani's group operates seven airports in India and has often faced criticism from Indian opposition parties for winning favours from ruling governments. Indian officials and the Adani group have denied such accusations.
Kenya is struggling with a high debt load accumulated from years of splurging on infrastructure.
A proposal by the government to hike taxes to generate extra money needed for debt repayments sparked deadly protests this summer and forced the government to rescind the proposal.

Supreme Court allows Adani-Dickey consortium to continue operating Coastal Energen power plant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/supreme-court-allows-adani-dickey-consortium-to-continue-operating-coastal-energen-power-plant/articleshow/113296373.cms,12-09-2024,"The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the consortium of
Adani Power
and
Dickey Alternative Investment Trust
to continue to operate
Coastal Energen
's 1,200 MW-thermal
power plant
till the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
) decided various appeals against the approval granted to the resolution plan for the
debt-laden firm
.
However, the apex court said that the Adani-Dickey consortium, the successful resolution applicant (SRA), would not dismantle the Coastal Energen’s power plant in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, or create any third party rights or create any financial obligations except in the ordinary course of business.
The Bench led by
Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud
said that “prima facie, we are of the view that the September 6 order (of NCLAT) suffers from internal inconsistency. The first part indicates status quo ante has to be restored and the second part shows status quo has to be maintained as on date.”
While observing that prima facie due process was not followed and members of the consortium should not be allowed to make any gains, the NCLAT had on Friday (Sep 6) directed that the erstwhile resolution professional would continue to run Coastal Energen's power plant till September 18, the next date of hearing.
The apex court noted the arguments of the parties that the NCLAT would hear the challenge by Ahmed Burari, the suspended director of Coastal Energen, and Precious Energy Holdings and Mutiara Energy Holdings, the two shareholders of the company on September 18. They had challenged the NCLT’s approval given to Dickey Alternative and Adani Power's resolution plan for the debt-ridden firm.
Live Events
However, the SC clarified that its observations would not affect the final proceedings before the appellate tribunal.
Senior counsel
Mukul Rohatgi
and AM Singhvi, appearing for Adani-Dickey consortium, argued that Adani had the right to run the plant as the committee of creditors had approved their resolution plan on August 31 and accordingly they paid Rs 3,335 crore to 16 banks and took over the possession of the power plant.
During the hearing, the CJI enquired about “the great hurry for NCLAT to disturb the status quo on a Saturday? The CoC has approved them (the consortium) by 97% vote and if they have done it in their commercial wisdom, then what is the issue?”
Senior counsel
Kapil Sibal
, representing the former director of Coastal Energen, contended that Adani was never an eligible bidder as its expression of interest email in its independent capacity was rejected by the lenders. And later Dickey brought back Adani as part of the consortium and this “backdoor entry” can not be permitted under
IBC
.
The consortium in its appeal had told the SC that the Friday’s order did not disclose any reason for “grant of such an extraordinary order,” and had divested it from the operations of the power plant and put it back under the control of the erstwhile resolution professional, thereby restoring the status quo ante and that too at the instance of the erstwhile director of Coastal Energen.

Supreme Court
Wednesday, challenging the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's (
NCLAT
) order asking the companies to maintain a status quo on implementation of the resolution plan for debt-laden
Coastal Energen
.
A bench, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, posted the matter for hearing Thursday after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi sought urgent hearing in the case.
Observing that prima facie due process was not followed and members of the consortium should not be allowed to make any gains, the NCLAT on Friday directed that the erstwhile resolution professional would continue to run Coastal Energen's power plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, until September 18, the next date of hearing. Any money generated in this period would be kept in an escrow account, it ruled.
Challenging the NCLAT's order, the consortium told the SC that Friday's order did not disclose any reason for ""grant of such an extraordinary order,"" although the appellate tribunal was informed about the successful resolution applicant having paid nearly ₹3,335 crore to stakeholders of the debt-laden company post approval of resolution plan by the NCLT, Chennai, on August 30.

Dickey Alternative Investment Trust
and
Adani Power
consortium moved the
Supreme Court
on Wednesday, challenging the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (
NCLAT
) recent directive to maintain the status quo in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) of
Coastal Energen
Private Limited.
The NCLAT, Chennai, issued the status quo order on September 6, in response to an appeal filed against the National Company Law Tribunal’s (
NCLT
) approval of a ₹3,335 crore resolution plan. The plan, submitted by the Dickey Alternative Investment Trust and Adani Power consortium, aimed to revive Coastal Energen, a Tuticorin-based power plant operator.
The appellate tribunal, consisting of Judicial Member Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma and Technical Member Jatindranath Swain, directed the resolution professional, Radhakrishnan Dharmarajan, to continue operating the Coastal Energen plant while maintaining the resolution amount in a separate account until the case is resolved on its merits.
The consortium had already implemented the resolution plan and assumed control of Coastal Energen following the NCLT's approval last month. Under the plan, secured lenders of Coastal Energen were to receive approximately ₹3,330 crore, amounting to 28.52% of the admitted claims totaling around ₹11,677 crore.
The urgency of the appeal before the Supreme Court was underscored by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and senior counsel AM Singhvi, who mentioned the matter for an immediate hearing before a bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud. The Chief Justice has scheduled the hearing for tomorrow, emphasizing the high stakes involved.

The NCLAT has posted the next hearing for September 18, 2024, leaving the consortium's future involvement in Coastal Energen hanging in the balance. The appeal against the NCLT's nod was initiated by Ahmed Buhari, the former director of Coastal Energen, who alleged procedural lapses in selecting the consortium as the successful bidder under the insolvency and bankruptcy process. Coastal Energen was admitted for CIRP by the NCLT in February 2022, following a case filed by the

(
Tata Power-DDL
) and Kyoto-based
Nissin Electric
will start a demonstration project to supply electricity from India's first micro substation with power voltage transformer (PVT) to ensure stable power for areas without a power grid.
Nissin
is a electric equipment company.
""The project is a part of international demonstration project on Japan's Energy Efficiency Technologies, publicly solicited by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO),"" said Tata Power-DDL, a power utility supplying electricity over 2 million customers in North Delhi.
It further said the project aims to supply cost-effective and stable power to remote areas across India that are far from power grid or do not have fully developed grid, but they do have power transmission lines nearby.
Instead of constructing a large network that requires substantial budget and large installation space, a micro substation with PVT can convert high-voltage power directly from transmission lines to low-voltage power suitable for residential consumers.
For this demonstration project, it will be a 100-kVA installation which will be directly stepping down the 3 phase 66 kilo volts to 1 Phase 240 volts power supply.
Live Events
Gajanan S Kale
, chief executive officer of Tata Power-DDL, said the project has the potential to change the matrix of power supply and solve the issues related to power supply in the large remote and rural areas of India.
The approximate area required for the installation will be only 40 square metres, the power utility firm said.
""We, at Nissin Electric, are stepping up efforts to promote SDGs across our business verticals,"" said
Kenji Kobayashi
, managing director, Nissin Electric.
Tata Power-DDL and Nissin Electric signed a project agreement on August 21.
Prior to the start of the project, NEDO signed a letter of intent with
Power Finance Corporation
in January this year regarding a demonstration project to supply power through a micro substation using PVT.

""The lenders have now been severe on us as we continue to meet our commitment to Bangladesh,"" Adani wrote in a letter dated August 27, adding, ""I would request for your kind intervention in early liquidation of $800 million of receivables due from Bangladesh Power Development Board.""
ET has seen a copy of the letter.
""May we request for regular payment of routine bills as we continue with our commitment on supplies and in addition significant tranches be made each month to liquidate outstanding dues,"" Adani said.
ET had on August 27 reported that the Bangladesh Power Development Board owes Adani Power $800 million in power supply dues for a period of eight to nine months.

Adani Power supplies electricity to Bangladesh from its 1.6 GW coal-fired power plant in Godda, Jharkhand through a dedicated transmission corridor. Adani Power began supplying from the Godda plant last June. According to Care Ratings, the plant has a 25-year power purchase agreement with Bangladesh Power Development Board at a remunerative tariff.
As against a monthly receivable of about $90-95 million, the company is being paid around $40-45 million, leading to an accumulation of the receivables, said people with knowledge of the developments.
Adani Power did not respond to an email query.
Adani said in his letter that Adani Power has invested $2 billion in building a state-of-the-art plant and associated transmission infrastructure and delivered it in a record time of 3.5 years despite being impacted by three waves of Covid.
""I would like to reiterate our commitment to your country's energy security and infrastructure development,"" said Adani, adding that the group is keen to explore opportunities where it can leverage its expertise in infrastructure buildouts.
Adani Group through Bangladesh Edible Oil Ltd also operates oil refineries in Rupshi,
Narayanganj
, and Mongla. The group also has an integrated unit at Bogra for rice packaging and rice-bran oil processing.
""We contribute to Bangladesh's food supply through popular edible oil and premium rice brands such as Rupchanda, Meizan, and Fortune,"" said Adani, adding that he appreciates the support and cooperation received from authorities, local communities, and stakeholders in Bangladesh.

Supreme Court seeks response from Adani Power over Rajasthan discoms appeal on 'change in law' benefits,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/supreme-court-seeks-response-from-adani-power-over-rajasthan-discoms-appeal-on-change-in-law-benefits/articleshow/113200260.cms,09-09-2024,"The
Supreme Court
on Monday sought response from
Adani Power
on an appeal by
Rajasthan discoms
against the sectoral tribunal’s April order directing them to pay “huge sum” of Rs 186 crore as benefits due to ‘change in law’ along with carrying costs at LPS rates of their
Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA) with the former.
Alleging that Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (
APTEL
) erroneously allowed a huge margin of profit/ windfall gain in favour of Adani, the four Rajasthan discoms claimed to have paid around Rs 124 crore till July 31, the date of filing the appeal.
A Bench led by Justice MM Sundresh issued notice to
Adani Power
and Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) on an appeal by four state discoms - Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd, Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd, Jodhpur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd and Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (Now Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services).
The discoms told the SC that “the APTEL has erroneously allowed a huge margin of profit or let’s say windfall gain in favour of Adani, despite the fault being attributable to Adani for causing delay in litigation.”
Claiming to have acted in a bonafide manner, the appeal stated that the discoms had paid around Rs 124 crore out of the total amount of Rs 186 crore, in terms of the tribunal’s April 18 judgment and RERC’s June 19 order. “The remaining amount is under process and will be disbursed soon,” it added.
Live Events
In 2009, Adani Power in a competitive bidding process had bagged contract for supply of 1200 MW of power to be generated at Kawai Power Project, Rajasthan, to the discoms to meet the power requirements of the state. The four discoms had entered into a power PPA with Adani Power for supply of 1200 MW aggregate contracted capacity at a levelised tariff of Rs 3.238 per unit. The agreement was also approved by RERC.
In 2017,
Coal India
, through a notification, imposed a levy of evacuation facility charges at Rs 50 per tonne applicable on every coal dispatch, except dispatch through rapid loading arrangement, with effect from December 20, 2017.
Adani had notified Rajasthan Urja Vikas that the Coal India notification constituted a ‘change in law’ event and also filed a petition before the Commission seeking evacuation facility charges along with carrying costs.
While the Commission in 2019 disallowed Adani’s petition, the sectoral tribunal allowed the evacuation facility charges to be paid in favour of Adani Power from the date of notification and also granted relief of carrying cost at late payment surcharge rates of PPA to Adani.

Adani Group
has issued a stark warning to Bangladesh’s new interim government, led by Nobel laureate
Muhammad Yunus
, regarding the mounting backlog of unpaid dues from a significant
power project
. According to a report by the Financial Times,
Bangladesh
has fallen behind on payments by $500 million, with
Adani
labeling the situation as ""unsustainable.""
This payment shortfall has emerged as a critical challenge for Yunus’s administration, which took power last month following the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus’s government has criticized the expensive infrastructure agreements negotiated under Hasina, including the contentious deal with Adani to supply coal power from its 1,600-megawatt Godda plant in India.
Adani Power
, in a statement to the Financial Times, emphasized its ongoing commitment to providing reliable power to Bangladesh despite the growing financial strain. ""We are in constant dialogue with the Bangladesh government and have appraised them of this unsustainable situation where we are meeting not just our supply commitment but also [commitments] to our lenders and suppliers in spite of rising receivables,"" the company said.
The financial liabilities are part of a broader
energy crisis
in Bangladesh, where total power-related debts have reached $3.7 billion. Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, Yunus’s chief energy adviser, told the Financial Times that Bangladesh is overdue on $492 million of its $800 million debt to Adani. The interim government is seeking financial assistance from international lenders, including the World Bank, to stabilize its economy.
Bangladesh has experienced rapid growth in recent years but continues to grapple with chronic energy shortages, exacerbated by declining domestic gas reserves. Critics have pointed out that measures taken by the previous administration, such as bypassing open tendering processes, have contributed to widespread corruption and inefficiencies.

Despite the financial pressures, Adani has asserted that it has no intentions of diverting power supplies away from Bangladesh, underscoring its continued commitment to the deal. ""Currently our Godda plant is not connected to the Indian grid and hence there is no question of looking for any alternate supply market,"" the company said.
The interim government, while seeking to renegotiate terms for better financial efficiency, has also expressed a desire to maintain positive relations with both India and China, emphasizing that future infrastructure deals must be cost-effective and transparent.

India power emissions must peak by 2026 to meet Paris pact,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-power-emissions-must-peak-by-2026-to-meet-paris-pact/articleshow/113122612.cms,06-09-2024,"Emissions from India’s high-polluting power industry must peak by 2026 for the country to hit
net zero
by the middle of the century and align itself with the
Paris Agreement
, according to BloombergNEF, a target that’s unlikely to be met due to the government’s push for the continued use of coal.
The world’s third-biggest emitter needs $12.4 trillion in investment to reach net zero ahead of its official target of 2070, BNEF said in its New Energy Outlook for India published Thursday. That includes funding to accelerate clean energy deployment, large-scale adoption of
electric vehicles
, and scaling up new technologies like carbon capture and
green hydrogen
to decarbonize the coal-dependent economy.
The report comes as India expands
renewables
but remains heavily reliant on coal to meet the power needs of the world’s largest population, prompting calls for it to be more ambitious in weaning itself off the dirtiest fossil fuel to support the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming below 2C (3.6F).
New Delhi has announced a fresh pipeline of coal power projects and pushed old polluting facilities to defer phase-outs until 2030, citing the fuel’s importance for energy security, at least until clean solutions become affordable for round-the-clock supply.
“It seemed evident until a couple of years ago that India’s power sector emissions will peak around 2026, but the government’s fresh push for coal power has delayed that target,” said Sunil Dahiya, a New Delhi-based analyst with
Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air
. “But we still remain hopeful that the emissions will peak before 2030.”

Renewable energy sector to provide momentum to Indian economy: Pralhad Joshi
Bloomberg
Coal accounts for about three-quarters of India’s electricity generation, a share that’s more or less held steady despite more than 100 gigawatts of renewables coming on stream over the past decade. BNEF projects the fuel will remain one of the country’s largest energy sources even as fossil fuels see their share in primary energy demand drop by nearly a third by 2050, from 77% in 2023.
“We don’t feel that coal is going to go away for next 30 to 40 years,” said Debasish Nanda, the director of business development at Coal India Ltd. “That is why we are investing in power plants.”
The nation aims to reach 500 gigawatts of clean power capacity by 2030. That will require annual additions of more than 40 gigawatts from low-carbon sources, triple the average yearly deployments in the past five years, according to Bloomberg calculations based on government data.

Lithium startups bet on high demand in battery-powered future
Federal Road Transport Minister
Nitin Gadkari
warned the country’s growing use of fossil fuels — and its $262 billion import bill — is unsustainable. Speaking at a BNEF summit in New Delhi, he urged vehicle manufacturers to build alternative fuel capacities to help decarbonize the transportation sector, which generates 12% of energy-related emissions, and curb chronic pollution in cities.
BNEF’s annual report assessed two scenarios: an ambitious road map where India hits net zero emissions two decades ahead of its official target; and an ‘economic transition scenario’ where investment decisions lean entirely on cost economics, shutting out expensive technologies like carbon capture and clean hydrogen.
In the less-ambitious scenario, coal use wouldn’t peak until 2038 and its unabated burning would still provide a fifth of power generation by 2050, meaning emissions will remain high through the middle of the century. Electricity generation would only triple from 2023 levels, versus a five-fold rise aided by production of clean hydrogen in the net zero scenario.
“It’s therefore imperative that India ups its climate ambition, comes out with a road map for deep decarbonization of the economy and declares target years to achieve peak emissions from various sectors,” said Shantanu Jaiswal, BNEF’s head of research in India.

To facilitate its expansion plans, the company has secured extensive domestic fuel tie-ups under long- and medium-term contracts, it said in an analyst presentation on Tuesday.
""For fuel assurance, the company has secured new power purchase agreement bids for 6,400 MW linking pre-assigned mines from state allocations. It also has the enhancement of fuel availability and cost control through commercial mining licences at advantageous locations,"" it said in the presentation.
The company has identified a development pipeline of 11.2 GW. It is setting up three projects of 1,600 megawatts each at Raipur, Raigarh and Mirzapur. The Raipur and Raigarh projects are brownfield expansions in Chhattisgarh at the cost of nearly ₹10,000 crore, while the Mirzapur project in UP is a greenfield facility, being built by Adani Power subsidiary Mirzapur Thermal Energy (UP) Pvt Ltd.
The company is likely to spend about ₹14,000 crore on the Mirzapur project, considering the estimated cost of setting up a greenfield thermal power plant is ₹8-9 crore per MW.
Last week, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved a Rs 3,336 crore resolution plan for Coastal Energen, submitted by Dickey Alternative Investment Trust and Adani Power.
Coastal Energen owns and operates a coal-based thermal power plant at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu and has been under financial distress for several years. It has an operational 558 MW power-purchase agreement with the Tamil Nadu state power distributor.

The lower prices so far this month has led to more volume traded compared with last year.
The average daily volume in DAM, which is the segment most traded in the
electricity market
, grew around 19.4% on year to around 152.3 million units in the first 28 days of the month. The peak power demand, too, has plummeted compared to last year. On August 26, the peak demand was around 202 GW whereas on the same day last year, it was at 224 GW.
Price Play
The maximum price that hit the electricity market in DAM so far this month is ₹6.64 a unit, whereas last year the rate reached up to ₹9.36. Real-time market minimum price so far in the month is ₹1.83 a unit compared with ₹3.17 a year back. Maximum price in the segment was ₹ 6.66 per unit against ₹9.96 last year.

With the introduction of this scheme, participation of the State Governments in the hydro development shall be encouraged and risk and responsibilities shall be shared in a more equitable manner. The issues such as land acquisition, rehabilitation & resettlement and local law & order issues would be reduced with state governments becoming stakeholders. This would avoid time and cost over-run of the projects.
Development of hydroelectric projects shall also contribute towards realization of India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of establishing 500 GW

in Godda, Jharkhand, through a dedicated transmission corridor.
SEIL Energy India
is owed about $150 million as on June 30, 2024. It has a
power purchase agreement
for 250 MW with Bangladesh, where an uprising recently forced its Prime Minister to flee to India.
NTPC
, which supplies around 740 MW from three of its plants, is owed nearly $80 million.
PTC India
had been owed about $84.5 million as of March end. Of this, it has got $46 million till August 25, the company said in an emailed response to ET's query. It's currently due $79 million from the neighbouring country. PTC supplies 250 MW of power to the Bangladesh Power Development Board from West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Co.

""Some companies have had issues related to payment, with some of it related to coal purchase as well,"" a government official said.
No supply disruptions
The companies haven't stopped supplies despite the dues, reflecting the strong bond of friendship between the two countries, said the executives cited above.
""But it cannot continue forever as they too are answerable to their stakeholders,"" one of the persons said.
An Adani Power official acknowledged the issue but refused to comment on the dues owed.
""We need a solution soon, else we will find it difficult to continue the supply of power, especially when lenders, suppliers of coal, spares, other commodities, and plant operation-related services need upfront payment,"" said an executive of one of the power companies listed above.
The Godda plant, which was fully commissioned in July 2023, uses imported coal. At the time of commissioning, the company had said the electricity supplied from the plant would have a positive impact on Bangladesh by replacing costly power generated from liquid fuel.
Adani has continued to supply power as per the Bangladesh Power Development Board schedule, said one of the persons cited above.

Sharma said in the case of small modular reactors (SMRs), the plan was to make 40-50 reactors in less than seven to eight years but added that it required a high degree of standardisation, safety and modularity.
Presenting the Union budget last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government would partner with the private sector to set up Bharat Small Reactors and in the research and development of SMRs.

She had said the government would also partner with the private sector for research and development of newer technologies for nuclear energy.
Sharma said engineers would redesign the PHWR using 3D design platforms that were not available 40 years ago when these reactors were first designed.
The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited has till date set up 16 220-MWe PHWRs, two 540-MWe PHWRs and two 700-MWe PHWRs.
Fourteen more PHWRs of 700 MWe capacity each are under various stages of implementation and are expected to be commissioned progressively by 2031-32.
Tata Consulting Engineers has been associated with the Department of Atomic Energy for several decades and has an 85 per cent market share in engineering services in the nuclear sector and is implementing several power projects.
Sharma said the mention of SMRs by the finance minister in her budget speech clearly showed the strong commitment to energy transition.
""To be honest, the only viable long-term solution for net zero is nuclear. I think nuclear is the bet; globally, everybody recognises it,"" he added.
SMRs can be factory-built, unlike conventional nuclear reactors that are built on-site.
They have a power capacity of up to 300 MWe per unit. Being a mobile and agile technology, SMRs can be set up at locations unsuitable for larger plants.
SMRs are seen to be making a significant and meaningful contribution to the energy transition phase as part of efforts to deal with the effects of climate change.

Adani Power, which offered as to how the Fed might proceed after its September gathering '27,000 crore for the parent company, was also in the fray for Raigarh Champa Rail (used to transport coal) and KSK Water.
Vedanta
and Jindal Power were the other companies keen to acquire the ancillary companies.
The efficiency of the power plant will largely depend on the support from these two special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Since the company is under the purview of the bankruptcy court, there exists an agreement between the two SPVs and the power-generating company. However, the contour of the agreement may change when they get new owners, the people cited above said.
Medha Servo and Venkata Chalam Varanasi, the resolution professional of KSK Water and Champa Rail, did not respond to ET's request for comment. The RP admitted '878 crore and '544 crore lender claims, respectively, according to the company's website.
Lenders of KSK Mahanadi Power received ten financial offers. Other bidders include Capri Global Holdings,
Coal India
,
NTPC
, Vedanta,
JSW Energy
, Naveen Jindal-owned Jindal Steel & Power, iLab India Special Fund, Rashmi Metaliks and Sherisha Technologies, as reported by ET on August 3.
Adani Power made the highest offer of '27,000 crore, followed by Capri Global at '25,000 crore and NTPC at Rs 22,200 crore.
The PWC-supported resolution professional, Sumit Binani, has admitted '29,330 crore in claims from financial creditors for the thermal power company, which operates three units of 600 MW each in Chhattisgarh.
As many as six ARCs jointly control 54.4% of verified claims after acquiring loans from multiple banks.

Adani Power has $800 million in unpaid dues from Bangladesh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-has-800-million-in-unpaid-dues-from-bangladesh/articleshow/112736570.cms,23-08-2024,"Billionaire
Gautam Adani
’s power generating unit has raked up unpaid dues of as much as $800 million from Bangladesh, where weeks of violent protests left hundreds dead and forced out the previous administration this month.
The South Asian country owes this sum to
Adani Power
Ltd., part of the Indian mining-to-media conglomerate, for electricity supplied by its coal-fired plant in the
Godda district
of the eastern state of Jharkhand, Bangladesh Bank’s newly-appointed Governor Ahsan H. Mansur told Bloomberg News in an interview.

“If we don’t pay them, they will stop providing electricity,” he said.
While the power producer has no plans of cutting the supply lines as of now, it will come under pressure from lenders and coal suppliers if the payments remain unpaid, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Adani Power will continue to supply power to Bangladesh
Adani Power is in talks with Bangladesh’s interim government to sort out this issue, they added.
An Adani Group representative did not immediately respond to an email seeking a comment on the Bangladesh dues.
Geopolitical Risks
The delayed payments underscore the financial and geopolitical risks Adani Group faces as it steadily expands its global footprint, including in India’s neighboring nations of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal — often in lockstep with Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi

Gautam Adani shared a post on X in 2022 on the commissioning of the Godda power project and lauding the then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s vision for Bangladesh. The plant started commercial operations in April last year.
Besides Adani Power, a handful of other India state-owned firms, including
NTPC Ltd.
and
PTC India Ltd.
, also supply electricity to Bangladesh. There’s no clarity on whether those companies have some unpaid dues as well.
Earlier this month, Bangladesh’s powerful army chief and president helped install an interim government to calm deadly student-led protests that had forced Hasina to flee the country.
But it’s still facing an economic crisis with overall arrears of as much as $2 billion, including dues to airlines that have to be paid immediately, Mansur said.

“The message is that we need money,” Mansur said. “We want to clear all the arrears.”

""... We have already crossed 200 GW (RE capacity addition) and additional 300 GW has to be realised in the next 6 years, of this (300GW) almost 225 GW will be from solar and wind,"" he said.
On capacity addition, he said this plan prioritises the RE zones of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh etc. as there are large chunks of solar potential lands available.
He also talked about plan to install offshore wind farms near Gujarat and Tamil Nadu coast and added that the country is also gearing up to add green hydrogen capacity in a big way especially coastal areas of Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and so on.
""We have large demand that is going to come from EVs and also data centres,"" he pointed out.
Together with the electrification of the economy all these will drive the demand that is going to come up in the near future, he stated.
The whole country, if you see, is connected into a single grid running on single frequency and it is capable of transferring 170 GW power from one end to another even remote regions in Arunachal and Ladakh are connected.
He noted that the government is promoting the storage through PSPs (pumped hydro storage projects) and batteries.
""We aim for 40 GW of BESS (battery energy storage system) and 19 GW PSP capacity in next 6 years and in the budget also an announcement made that a new PSP Policy would come to push PSP projects,"" he stated.
The government has also improved about 4GWh of BESS through VGF (viability gas funding). Beyond this we are creating a policy framework for bringing battery energy storage systems in a short-term in a big way, he added.

The bankrupt power company owes about Rs 14,631 crore to its secured financial creditors. The company’s major secured creditors include Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Axis Bank and Life Insurence Corporation of India.
LAPL has Rs 1,800 crore cash in the company solely on account of operations from the first phase.
Lanco Amarkantak Power was admitted for corporate insolvency proceedings in September 2019, but its resolution was delayed for various reasons. In January 2022, lenders rejected the sole offer of Rs. 3,000 crore from Twin Star Technologies, a company owned by metals maven Anil Agarwal, because it was too low.
Later, when lenders restarted the sale process, apart from Adani Power, Reliance Industries and the PFC-led consortium also showed interest in acquiring the company.
However, Adani and Reliance did not participate in the auction, citing a violation of the sale process, while the PFC-led consortium was the sole bidder offering Rs 3,020 crore.
In January 2023, 95% of lenders by value voted in favour of the PFC-led consortium's plan but the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) did not endorse the plan for several months.
Subsequently, Adani Power gave an unsolicited improved offer of Rs. 3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2, and later, it improved the offer to Rs. 4,101 crore, as reported by ET on December 13.

14 hydropower projects damaged due to flash floods in Himachal since July 25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/14-hydropower-projects-damaged-due-to-flash-floods-in-himachal-since-july-25/articleshow/112718157.cms,22-08-2024,"New Delhi: At least 14 hydroelectric projects in
Himachal Pradesh
have suffered damage due to
flash floods
since July 25, with some being affected multiple times over the past 10 years, according to a new analysis. As damage to hydroelectric projects from flash floods and
cloudbursts
becomes a recurring issue -- impacting both communities and power generation -- experts are calling for disaster risk analyses to be conducted before such projects are undertaken.
They also recommend the preparation of robust disaster management plans, and the installation of early warning systems and flood forecast stations.
According to the analysis by the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers, and People (
SANDRP
), two hydroelectric projects (HEPs) suffered significant damage due to a ""cloudburst-induced flash flood"" in the Palchan area of Kullu district on the intervening night of July 25-26.
Both HEPs -- the 2-megawatt Pinnacle HEP on the Serai river and the 9-MW Beas Kund HEP on the
Beas river
-- are owned and operated by private companies.
""We have lost everything except the powerhouse building,"" Viany Parma, the manager of the Beas Kund project, told SANDRP.
Live Events
Bhim Rawat of SANDRP said that Google Earth imagery shows that the powerhouses of both HEPs were built in active flood zones of the Serai and Beas rivers.
He said between July 29 and August 1, multiple flash floods damaged 12 HEPs in the Kullu and Shimla districts of the state.
Six projects were damaged in the Beas river basin in Kullu district, including the 4-megawatt Jirah HEP, 800-KW Raksat Mini HEP, 5-MW Brahmaganga HEP, 100-MW Malana 2 HEP, and 86-MW Malana 1 HEP.
The flash floods also impacted seven HEPs in the Ghanvi Khad and Samej Khad of the Sutlej river basin in the Rampur tehsil of Shimla district.
These are the 13.5-MW Upper Nanti HEP, 8-MW Kurmi HEP, 14-MW Lower Nanti HEP, 14-MW Sumez HEP, 22.5-MW Ghanvi 1 HEP, 4.5-MW Sechi HEP, and 10-MW Ghanvi II HEP.
A flash flood on July 31-August 1 killed at least eight workers of the Sumez project, according to media reports.
Some of the projects, including the Brahmaganga, Jirah, Beas Kund, Malana II, Upper Nanti, and Sumez HEPs, in both Kullu and Shimla districts have been affected multiple times over the past decade, the analysis showed.
Rawat said that the impact in Shimla is so severe that officials from private HEPs have been unable to reach the project sites to assess the damage.
The flash floods have rendered all 14 HEPs non-operational, leading to significant generation losses.
""The frequency of heatwaves and heavy rains is increasing due to global warming, and it's only going to get worse. We should account for worsening extreme weather events when designing such projects,"" Madhavan Rajeevan, former secretary of the Union Earth Sciences Ministry, told PTI.
Himanshu Thakkar, the coordinator of SANDRP, pointed out that there are no inflow forecast stations or level forecast stations in Himachal Pradesh. As a result, no flood forecasts are made in the state, which are crucial for saving lives and public property.
A Central Water Commission official in Shimla told PTI that there are plans to establish inflow and level forecast stations in the state but did not divulge details.
Thakkar added that the Union Environment Ministry should conduct disaster risk analyses before hydroelectric projects are built.
Independent post-disaster assessments should be conducted after such incidents. Robust disaster management plans should be prepared, and early warning systems should be installed, he said.

"As Sarda Energy deposits ₹1.9kcr for SKS power, deal challenged",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/as-sarda-energy-deposits-1-9kcr-for-sks-power-deal-challenged/articleshow/112691351.cms,22-08-2024,"Within a week of the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT) approving its takeover of
SKS Power Generation Ltd
, winning bidder
Sarda Energy and Minerals
has deposited ₹1,950 crore into an escrow account with
Bank of Baroda
(BoB) - ahead of the 45-day deadline set by lenders.
In a stock exchange filing Tuesday,
Sarda Energy
confirmed the payment, including ₹1,805 crore paid to financial creditors of SKS Power,
State Bank of India
and BoB, as well as additional expenses for the insolvency process. It also includes excess cash in the company to be given to lenders. The NCLT on August 13 approved the transaction, with BoB Capital as the process advisor.
""The transfer was made on earlier this week well ahead of the 45-day timeline provided for in the resolution plan. Sarda has raised a majority of the funds from banks with about 30% from internal accruals,"" said a person familiar with the deal.
Sarda's rush to pay the money comes amid losing bidders
Torrent Power
and Vantage Point Asset Management challenging the NCLT order in the
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal
(NCLAT), with two separate petitions seeking a review of the judgement. Torrent argues that due process was not followed, while Vantage says that their offer was better than Sarda.
Chhattisgarh-based SKS went through an intense takeover battle for over two years as it operates a rare working 600-MW power plant available for sale, with 25 years of fuel agreement accompanying a railway line.

During her visit, Foreign Minister of Nepal also called on the Prime Minister.
The Nepalese foreign minister’s visit comes a week after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri travelled to Kathmandu.
Misri’s meetings saw both sides appreciate the progress made in the power sector in recent years. The two sides, during Misri’s visit, also acknowledged the progress achieved in recent years in terms of connectivity –– physical, digital, energy and human –– which has manifested through steady implementation of infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, Integrated Check Posts, cross-border railways as well as petroleum pipelines.

has moved the appellate tribunal
NCLAT
against the approval of
Sarda Energy
and Mining's resolution plan for the debt-ridden SKS Power Generation. Earlier on August 13, the Mumbai-based bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), while approving Sarda Energy and Mining's (SEML) bid, had rejected applications, including of Torrent Power, to acquire SKS Power Generation.
Torrent Power
had raised objections over the selection process, terming it to be discriminatory, and contended that it has proposed the highest upfront payment. The Torrent group firm also sought a copy of the approved plan, which was rejected by the NCLT.
The order has now been challenged by Torrent Power before the Delhi-based bench of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
Torrent Power's petition is scheduled for hearing on Tuesday before a three-member bench of the NCLAT headed by its Chairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan.
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) was started against SKS Power Generation in April 2022 over the plea of
Bank of Baroda
, which had a total admitted claims of Rs 2,560 crore.

Along with Torrent Power, several other companies like NTPC, Jindal Power, and Singapore-based Vantage Point Asset Management were in the race. However, SEML's resolution plan was voted by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in favour of SKS Power Generation.
According to media reports, SEML's bid of over Rs 2,000 crore covers nearly all dues owed to the financial creditors.
Torrent Power approached the NCLT after the Resolution Professional of SKS Power Generation filed a petition to seek the insolvency tribunal's approval for the SEML's bid.
The Ahmedabad-based company contended before the NCLT that it had submitted the highest upfront cash payment to the creditors of SKS Power Generation after incorporating the observations of the RP and lenders.
The Torrent group firm argued that owing to its highest proposed upfront payment, it ought to have been declared as the successful bidder and not ""the Respondent No 2 (SEML) which, per its contentions, had lower qualitative and quantitative credentials"".
It also alleged that the RP has deviated from the terms of RFRP (Request for Resolution Plan) and the Process Note by allegedly giving additional opportunities to SEML to further improve its resolution plan by allowing modifications in its key commercial terms, the 124-page-long NCLT order mentioned.
Torrent Power also alleged it to be ""discriminatory"" as it was done without providing similar opportunities to other resolution applicants.
The Torrent group firm had requested the NCLT to direct the RP of SKS Power to serve a complete copy of the Plan Approval Application.
It had also asked to defer the pronouncement of orders in the Plan Approval Application filed by RP until the adjudication and disposal of its present plea.
Torrent Power's plea was opposed by Resolution Professional and SEML before the NCLT. The lenders submitted that it has deliberated extensively on the feasibility and viability of the resolution plans submitted by all the resolution applicants, including Torrent Power and has accordingly voted upon SEML.
Moreover, NCLT also declined Torrent Power's plea to hand over a copy of the approved plan citing a judgement from the Supreme Court, which said the Resolution Plan furnished by one or the other Resolution Applicant is a confidential one and it cannot be disclosed to any Competing Resolution Applicant.
""We are thus not inclined to approve the instant application viz... and the same deserves to be dismissed,"" the NCLT had said.
SKS Power Generation has set up a coal-based Thermal Power Plant at Binjkote and Durramuda in Raigarh District, Chhattisgarh. The thermal power project consists of 4X300 MW capacity power generating units.
To date, Phase I of 2X300 MW capacity has been completed and the company is currently in the midst of commencing execution of Phase II 2X300 MW capacity, according to the information available on its website.

""Our
Neighbourhood First policy
and unique people-to-people & cultural connect propels our relationship forward,"" he added.
On her part, Deuba described the talks as ""productive"".
""Had a productive meeting with @DrSJaishankar in New Delhi. We discussed bilateral interests, various aspects of Nepal-India relations, and the exchange of mutual cooperation,"" she said on 'X'.
""I am confident this visit will further strengthen the centuries-old bond between Nepal and India,"" Deuba said.
The Nepalese foreign minister's visit comes a week after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri travelled to Kathmandu.
Nepal is an important neighbour for India in the context of its overall strategic interests in the region, and the leaders of the two countries have often noted the age-old ""Roti Beti"" relationship between the two sides.
The country shares a border of over 1,850 km with five Indian states -- Sikkim, West Bengal, Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh
and Uttarakhand. Land-locked Nepal relies heavily on India for the transportation of goods and services.

Adani Power will continue to supply power to Bangladesh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-will-continue-to-supply-power-to-bangladesh/articleshow/112569726.cms,16-08-2024,"Adani Power
on Friday said it will continue to supply power to
Bangladesh
from its 1,600MW
Jharkhand plant
, set up to supply 100 per cent
electricity
generated from the facility to the neighbouring nation. Earlier this month, the power ministry amended power import/export guidelines to enable electricity supply from plants set up as an export-oriented unit to sell power within India.
The amendment provides that the government may permit connection of such generating station to the Indian grid (inter-state or intra-state grid) to facilitate the sale of power within India 'in case of sustained non-scheduling of full or part capacity or default notice issued by the generator for any default, including delayed payment under the PPA (power purchase agreement)'.
Adani Power's 1,600 MW Godda plant is probably the only plant in the country which has been set up with a commitment of 100 per cent electricity supply to Bangladesh.
In a statement, Adani Power explained the amendment to India's Power Export Guidelines is an industry-enabling universal provision aimed at streamlining power export processes without altering existing arrangements.
""We have been providing uninterrupted power to Bangladesh from our Godda plant. We understand the importance of reliable
power supply
to Bangladesh and are committed to fulfilling contractual obligations as per BPDB's demand schedule and provisions of PPA,"" the company stated.
Live Events
The government's decision to allow the power plant with export commitment to supply electricity within India follows the recent political crisis in Bangladesh.
Besides, India endeavour to be a zero deficit power supply nation amid rising demand though its electricity shortfall is less than a percentage point.
India's power demand touched an all-time high of nearly 250GW in May this year.
The power ministry has projected that peak power demand may hit the 260 GW mark during this summer season.

Adani Power says it is committed to supplying electricity to Bangladesh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-says-it-is-committed-to-supplying-electricity-to-bangladesh/articleshow/112543736.cms,15-08-2024,"Adani Power
said on Thursday it was committed to
supplying
electricity to
Bangladesh
, saying a recent amendment to
power
export
rules
does not affect its existing
contract
.
The amendment by the government facilitates connectivity to the Indian grid but does not impose any obligation on India to buy electricity, Adani Power said in a statement.
""Adani Power is committed to fulfil contractual obligations as per Bangladesh Power Development Board's demand schedule and provisions of the power purchase agreement and would look forward to continuing reciprocal fulfilment,"" Adani Power said.
Adani Power's 1,600 megawatt (MW) Godda plant in Jharkhand state is the only one in India under contract to export 100% of its power to a neighbouring country.
The amendment, which governs generators supplying
electricity
""exclusively to a neighbouring country"", enables Adani to also supply electricity to the domestic market to hedge against political risks in Bangladesh.

An emailed query to the company’s resolution professional (RP) Ashish Rathi remained unanswered till the time of filing the story.
Apart from Nagpur-based SEML, other contenders such as Gujarat-based Torrent Group, Vantage Point Asset Management and Jindal Power had also shown interest in acquiring the company through an insolvency resolution process.
In this case, Sarda Energy & Minerals was represented by the law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan, and the company’s RP and the Committee of Creditors (CoC) were represented by law firm Trilegal and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, respectively. Also, BoB Capital Markets was the process advisor to both the CoC and RP.
SKS Power Generation (Chhattisgarh) set up a coal-based thermal power plant at Binjkote and Durramuda in the Raigarh District of Chhattisgarh. The facility is in high demand because it is a rare working power plant available for sale with 25 years of fuel agreement accompanying a railway line.
The thermal power project consists of 4X300 MW capacity power generating units, utilizing Indian coal as the main fuel. The company is currently in the midst of the execution of Phase II 2X300 MW capacity, according to its website.
Ashish Pyasi, partner of the law firm Aendri Legal, said that on approval of a resolution plan, the stage of implementation and monitoring starts.
“There will be a monitoring committee as mentioned in the plan which will be monitoring the implementation of the plan and entrusted with the duty to ensure that there is no deviation,” said Pyasi. “The applicant will pay and distribution will take place as per the plan and any other conditions as stipulated in the plan will be complied by the successful bidder,” he added.

Coal India removes quantity limit for power producers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/coal-india-removes-quantity-limit-for-power-producers/articleshow/112503855.cms,13-08-2024,"New Delhi
:
Coal India Ltd
has removed the limit on the quantity purchased by
power producers
and allowed supply beyond their
annual contracted volume
.
The company has done away with an earlier provision which allowed coal supplies up to a maximum of 120% of the contracted quantity to
power plants
, it said on Tuesday.
Now, the simplification would benefit the power plants which prefer to lift higher quantities of coal beyond their stipulated contracted quantity, it said.
It said the move focused on increasing its volume sale of the fuel.
The change will apply to the power generators that have signed a
fuel supply agreement
with an enabling clause. The fillip for the
state-owned miner
is that the move would boost supplies at a time when
coal demand
is showing signs of slackening, the company said.

Adani Power
coal-fired
power plant
under contract to sell all its output to
Bangladesh
can now supply the domestic market after an amendment to

's power
export rules
, helping the company hedge against political risks in Bangladesh.
An internal federal power ministry memo, dated Aug. 12 and seen by Reuters, amends 2018 guidelines governing generators supplying electricity ""exclusively to a neighbouring country"". Currently only one plant in India - Adani Power's 1,600 megawatt (MW) Godda plant in eastern Jharkhand state - is under contract to export 100% of its power to a neighbouring country.
The memo says ""the government of India may permit connection of such generating station to the Indian grid to facilitate sale of power within India in case of sustained non-scheduling of full or part capacity"".
The move, which happened nearly a week after longtime Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina
fled Bangladesh amid deadly protests triggered by quotas for government jobs, could also benefit future projects where all output is locked into export contracts.
Bangladesh is battling anarchy and vandalism, with a caretaker government vowing that improving law and order was its top priority.
Live Events
The amendment by the Indian government also allows sale of power to the local grid if there is a delay in payments.
The conglomerate called the plant a ""shining example of India-Bangladesh cooperation"" in July 2023, shortly after its billionaire Chairman Gautam Adani met Hasina following full-load commissioning of the plant.
On Tuesday, an
Adani Group
spokesperson said the amendment would help increase the overall availability of power in India, and ""help cater to the soaring electricity demand across the country.""

Indigenous high-voltage alternating current lines may be deployed to boost transmission infrastructure,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indigenous-high-voltage-alternating-current-lines-may-be-deployed-to-boost-transmission-infrastructure/articleshow/112355764.cms,08-08-2024,"India could deploy indigenous high-voltage 1,200 kV high-voltage alternating current (
HVAC
) transmission lines for a significant expansion and upgradation of its
transmission infrastructure
, people familiar with the development said.
The move comes amid rising
electricity demand
and higher
renewable energy integration
.
While direct current (DC) lines could be technologically more advantageous for long distance, the
high-voltage AC lines
are expected to be cheaper for shorter distances and can be added at a faster pace, they said. So far in India, the maximum capacity at the commercial scale of AC lines is 765 kV. ""We are working on alternatives for transmission lines. We should be able to have a roadmap on going ahead with 1,200 kV HVAC lines soon,"" a government official told ET. The Centre tested a prototype of the technology way back in 2016 with state-run Power Grid Corp operationalising ultra-high voltage 1200 kV National Test Station (NTS) at Bina in Madhya Pradesh in a public-private-partnership mode.
Discussions are on to look at the issues in deploying the technology at the commercial level, the official said. Officials said 1,200 kV high-voltage AC lines would be faster to implement, effective for small distances, and have advantages of being indigenous. The Central Transmission Utility is likely to identify potential corridors where the lines can be deployed. For shorter distance transmission, the HVAC lines will be cost effective and will take about 2-3 years to commission, according to one of the persons.
""Many transmission lines are traversing now, especially in the renewable energy area, where many transmission lines are going toward single load centres. For small distances, if there is a bulk requirement, then this becomes economically viable,"" another official said.

KSK Mahanadi
Power to distribute the
surplus cash
amounting to Rs 6400 crore among lenders. According to people with knowledge of the matter, this is the first time lenders will recover a part of their dues before a resolution is approved by the

Capri Global, in a mailed response, reaffirmed its commitment. ""Our AIF, along with our investors, are committed and would like to acquire this company,"" it said. The AIF that Capri refers to here is the Capri Xponentia Stressed Asset Fund.
'May Receive Almost Entire Dues'
The PWC-supported resolution professional, Sumit Binani, has admitted ₹29,330 crore in claims from financial creditors for the thermal power company, which operates three units of 600 MW each.
For the Adani Group, the actual outgo as per the plan is ₹12,500 crore. This works out to a ₹7-crore bid per MW-the highest offered for any distressed thermal power asset so far. During Thursday's meeting with lenders, Binani disclosed the 10 plans, following which banks decided to seek improved offers from all bidders and subsequently hold an auction among them, people cited above said.
""There is a likelihood that lenders could receive nearly their entire dues after an auction among bidders,"" one lender said.
Adani Group had shown interest in acquiring KSK Mahanadi even before it was admitted for insolvency in October 2019. Late 2018, it had offered ₹10,300 crore, but backed out in February 2019 after the Uttar Pradesh government revised tariffs downward, a banker cited above said. The debt resolution of KSK Mahanadi, admitted into the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) five years ago, is delayed due to a series of litigations. Losing patience, a dozen lenders with about ₹16,165 crore of verified claims among them, separately sold their debts to various asset reconstruction companies (ARC).
As many as six ARCs jointly control 54.4% of verified claims after acquiring loans from multiple banks. Among the lenders,
State Bank of India
, Life Insurance Corporation,
Axis Bank
,
Punjab National Bank
,
Bank of Baroda
,
Indian Overseas Bank
,
Union Bank of India
,
Jammu and Kashmir Bank
,
Indian Bank
,
Federal Bank
,
Central Bank of India
and L&T Finance sold their loans. Among the ARCs, Aditya Birla ARC has the largest share, with 33.38% of the debt, followed by ASREC (India) at 12%.
NCLT had stayed the sale process in June 2022 after a plea from a lender to consolidate the resolution of KSK Mahanadi Power and two of its ancillary companies. These are KSK Water Infrastructure, which supplies water to the plant, and Raigarh Champa Rail, which carries the raw material to the plant.
These companies were separately admitted for corporate insolvency, and lenders wanted a consolidated resolution to maximise recovery, but NCLT rejected the consolidation proposal. Subsequently, lenders appealed against the tribunal's order at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, which, too, stayed the process. Binani invited bids after the stay was lifted.

"NTPC-NPCIL joint venture likely to invest Rs 50,400 cr in 2,800 MW nuclear power plant",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ntpc-npcil-joint-venture-likely-to-invest-rs-50400-cr-in-2800-mw-nuclear-power-plant/articleshow/112232774.cms,03-08-2024,"New Delhi:
NTPC
Ltd and Nuclear Power Corporation of India are likely to
invest
around Rs 50,400 crore for 2,800 MW Mahi-Banswara
nuclear power plant
to be jointly developed by the two state-owned companies.
The power generator expects the tendering process for the nuclear power project to start in the current financial year, people in the know said.
A proposal for transfer of the nuclear units to joint venture Anushakti Vidhyut Nigam Ltd from parent
NPCIL
is likely to go for approval of the Cabinet this month.
However, the company will not be involved anymore in the 1,400 MW Chutka Madhya Pradesh Atomic Power Project, which was also to be jointly developed with NPCIL, the person said.
For the power major, the
Mahi-Banswara
project would be an experience to carry forward its nuclear energy plans on a standalone basis, the person said.
Live Events
Green IPO
The company is also looking to list its green arm in November targeting a 10% dilution of its stake, the person said.
In November,
NTPC
Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) is likely to have a total installed capacity of 4,000 MW, another 8,000 MW under construction, and 8,000 MW more in various stages of development.
NGEL will drive India's largest power producer's ambitious clean energy programmes. The company will have subsidiaries and joint ventures to carry out the projects.
The power generator's subsidiary will be the flagbearer of its aim to add 60 GW renewable energy capacity by 2032. It is also looking to develop pumped hydro storage and green hydrogen and ammonia manufacturing projects.
Coal Procurement
For the first time, NTPC has issued an order to procure coal to the tune of 1 million tonnes from the commercial coal mines. These mines were opened for the private sector in 2020. This tender, which was placed last month, is on fuel transported to plant on 'quantity and quality' basis and the cost is projected to be lower than import, the person added.

Proposed Mirzapur thermal power plant does not involve forest area: Govt,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/proposed-mirzapur-thermal-power-plant-does-not-involve-forest-area-govt/articleshow/112222796.cms,02-08-2024,"The proposed 1600-megawatt
coal-based
ultra supercritical thermal power project (TPP) in Uttar Pradesh's
Mirzapur
does not involve
forest land
but 8.35 hectares forest land would be required outside the project area for a water pipeline and road access, the
government
has told Parliament. The
National Green Tribunal
earlier this week took suo motu notice of a media report which said the parcel of 665 hectares of land in Dadri Khurd in the eastern Uttar Pradesh district, within which the project site falls, is recorded as a 'forest' according to a gazette notification issued in 1952.
However, it is still pending notification under Section 20 of the Indian Forest Forest, 1927.
In response to a question by Trinamool Congress MP Mausam Noor, Union Minister of State for
Environment
Kirti Vardhan Singh said, ""The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is in receipt of proposal from Mirzapur Thermal Energy (UP) Private Limited seeking terms of reference (ToRs) for preparation of environment impact assessment (EIA) report under the provisions of EIA Notification, 2006 as amended for setting up of 2x800 MW coal based ultra super critical thermal power project (TPP) at village Dadri Khurd, Tehsil, Mirzapur Sardar, District Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh. As per the proposal submitted to the ministry, total project area is 365.19 Ha and no forest land is involved.""
""Further, there is an involvement of 8.35 Ha forest land (water pipeline: 5.8162 Ha and approach road: 2.5419 Ha) which falls outside the project area and project proponent has applied vide proposal no. FP/UP/THE/14236/2015 for obtaining Stage-I forest clearance. This proposal was considered by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) and recommended for grant of ToR which incorporates the specific condition related to compliance of Hon'ble National Green Tribunal (NGT) order dated December 21, 2016,"" the minister told the Rajya Sabha.
The EIA/EMP report which is prepared on the basis of ToRs evaluates the environmental impacts of projects including impacts on flora and fauna for which corresponding environmental management plan (EMP) is prepared.

Singh told Rajya Sabha that the use of any forest land must comply with state and central laws, and the state government is responsible for maintaining land records and determining the status of land.
According to the ministry's PARIVESH portal, the central government has so far not given approval for using forest land for this power plant, he said.
The TMC's Noor had asked whether the government was aware that the proposed
thermal power plant
site in Dadri Khurd, Mirzapur, falls within land recorded as 'forest' in a 1952 state government gazette.
Noor also asked as to how the government will protect the area's unique flora and fauna, especially the sloth bear, a species listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, and how the thermal plant proposal is justified, given the 2022 clarification on non-site specific proposals for forest clearances.
Schedule 1 of the Act covers endangered species that require rigorous protection. According to the January 2022 guidelines of the ministry, the utilization of forest area for establishing industries, construction of residential colonies, institutes, disposal of fly ash, rehabilitation of displaced persons, etc. are non-site-specific activities and cannot be considered on forest land as a rule.
""For that matter, no non-site-specific proposal can be entertained for considering approval under the FCA 1980,"" the guidelines read.
The Vindhyan Ecology and Natural History Foundation, a voluntary research group of scientists, experts and lawyers, in a letter to the environment ministry last month said the same site was once proposed for a 1320-MW coal-based thermal power plant by Welspun Energy (UP) Pvt Ltd, ""which was later transferred to the Mirzapur Energy (UP) Pvt. Ltd. owned by the Adani group"".
""The environmental clearance of the said project was set aside by the principal bench of the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi, in Debadityo Sinha v. Union of India (Appeal 79/2014) on December 21, 2016, with a direction to restore the site to its original condition,"" the foundation said.
Their letter said that the Marihan Range of Mirzapur Forest Division, which includes the 665 hectares of land in Dadri Khurd, is part of the proposed 'Sloth Bear Conservation Reserve' and is a crucial habitat for exceptionally rich and threatened wildlife of the savannah and tropical dry deciduous hill forests of the unique Vindhyan-Kaimoor ecosystem.
""This ecosystem includes at least 24 terrestrial animals listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, well documented and recorded. This includes animals like Sloth Bear, Leopard, Bengal Fox, Striped Hyena, Asiatic Wild Cat, Rusty Spotted Cat, Sambar, Chinkara, Blackbuck, Mugger Crocodile, and many other wild animals.
""The range is also a haven for birding, with grassland species like Indian Courser, Yellow-Wattled Lapwing, Sandgrouse, Savannah Nightjar, Indian Nightjar; raptors like Red-headed Vulture, Griffon Vulture, Egyptian Vulture, Indian Eagle Owl, Mottled Wood Owl, Short-eared Owl, Brown Fish Owl, Common Kestrel, Lesser Kestrel, Short-Toed Snake Eagle, and several other species, many of which are endemic, threatened, and migratory,"" the letter read.

Detailed project reports of two hydro pumped storage plants approved in record time: Power ministry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/detailed-project-reports-of-two-hydro-pumped-storage-plants-approved-in-record-time-power-ministry/articleshow/112222793.cms,02-08-2024,"The
power ministry
on Friday said the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has approved the detailed project report of two
hydro pumped storage plants
-- 600 MW Upper Indravati in
Odisha
and 2,000 MW Sharavathy in
Karnataka
-- in record time. To fast-track the concurrence process of hydro PSPs (pumped storage projects) in line with ease of doing business drive of the Government of India, the
CEA
has further revised the guidelines to simplify the process for preparation of DPRs (
detailed project reports
) of PSPs and its concurrence, a ministry statement said.
According to the statement, the 600 MW Upper Indravati in Odisha is being developed by OHPC Ltd (a Odisha government undertaking) and 2,000 MW Sharavathy in Karnataka is being developed by KPCL (a unit of Karnataka government).
CEA has received a number of proposals of hydro PSPs (around 60 GW), under survey and investigation for preparation of DPRs. All the developers are at various stages of preparation of DPR. After preparation of DPRs, these PSPs will be uploaded by the developers on CEA website for concurrence under section 8 of the Electricity Act, 2003.
According to the ministry, the government has prioritized the development of
energy storage systems
, particularly PSPs, to ensure the energy security of the country.
As per the National Electricity Plan (Generation), the installed capacity of energy storage systems including BESS is projected at 74 GW by 2031-32.

Under the revised guidelines for approval of DPRs of PSPs, the developers are allowed to submit the DPR online with completion of first 13 chapters. Some of the chapters have been dispensed with.
Now there is no mandatory requirement of approval of cost and financial chapters. These chapters need to be submitted only for reference and record to meet the requirement of the Act.
For close loop hydro PSP, there is no requirement to submit the alternative location plan for reservoirs.
The guidelines also provide for inclusion of an undertaking from developer stating that the DPR submitted is in line with pre-DPR clearances.
This obviates the requirement of again sending the DPR for reexamination. This is expected to save around 4 to 5 months' time in the concurrence process.
The process for giving excavation permission at the risk and cost of developers has been streamlined so that advance action can be taken by the developers to start the work at the site. This is expected to save around 6 to 8 months' time in execution of the project, the ministry said.
The developers have also been advised to carry out investigations and submit the reports to the appraising agencies on time so that parallel activities can be done by the appraising agencies. This is expected to save around 1 to 2 months' time, it added.

Currently, the company has admitted liabilities of over Rs 567 crore.
Athena Demwe was admitted for insolvency resolution process in 2017 and the CoC even accepted a revival plan submitted by Sikkim Power Investment Corporation. However, when the plan came for the approval of the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT), the resolution professional and lenders said the winning bidder failed to furnish the required bank guarantee.
The tribunal, in April this year, directed the RP and the lenders of Athena Demwe to invite fresh resolution plans while extending the period of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) for 120 more days.
Sikkim Power Investment challenged the order before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
Busava Prabhu Patil, counsel on behalf of Sikkim Power Investment argued that it was always ready and willing to submit the PBG (performance bank guarantee) and has requested an extension of time and the last request was made for the extension of time till June 15, 2024, to deposit, which remained pending consideration, hence the view of the NCLT that there is non-compliance is not correct.
Countering this, NPS Chawla of Aekom Legal, appeared for RP Umesh Garg and argued that despite several reminders and requests, the successful bidder failed to deposit the PBG.
The appellate tribunal on July 26 dismissed the appeal, but granted Sikkim Power Investment two weeks to submit a fresh revival plan that the Athena Demwe RP and CoC may consider along with the other bids.
Under the insolvency process, once the PRAs are declared, the resolution professional shares with them the information memorandum and request for resolution plan (RFRP), and provides them access to the data room (if any), legal experts said.
“Based on this information, the applicants will submit their plans which will be placed before the CoC for its approval,” explained Ashish Pyasi, partner at Aendri Legal.

stood at 140.41 BU, according to official data.
The highest supply in a day (
peak power demand
met) also rose to 226.63GW in July 2024 against 208.95 GW in the year-ago month.
The peak power demand touched an all-time high of 250.20 GW in May this year. The previous all-time high peak power demand of 243.27 GW was recorded in September 2023.
Earlier this year, the power ministry projected a peak power demand of 235 GW during daytime and 225 GW during evening hours for May and 240 GW during daytime and 235 GW during evening hours for June 2024.
The ministry also estimated that peak power demand may hit 260 GW this summer.
Live Events
Experts said with the onset of the
monsoon
in the country, the consumers got relief from the scorching heat and humidity which led to lesser use of cooling appliances like air conditioners and desert coolers.
This led to a decline in power consumption as well as growth in power demand in the country, they pointed out.
However, they opined that the demand for power as well as consumption will be steady in the coming days due to high humidity which makes use of air conditioners inevitable.
According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the monsoon has covered the entire country and widespread rains are likely at various places across India.

"Adani Power to set up 1600 MW greenfield power plant in UP for Rs 14,000 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-to-set-up-1600-mw-greenfield-power-plant-in-up-for-rs-14000-crore/articleshow/112186370.cms,01-08-2024,"Adani Power, India’s top private thermal power producer, is building a 1600 megawatt (2x800 MW) greenfield ultra-supercritical
thermal power plant
at Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh as part of its strategy to double thermal power capacity to about 30 megawatts. The unit is being built by
Adani Power
subsidiary Mirzapur Thermal Energy (UP) Pvt Ltd.
Adani Power
is likely to spend about Rs 14,000 crore in the project, considering the estimated cost of setting up a greenfield thermal power plant is Rs 8-9 crore per MW.
""Adani Power plans to double its thermal power capacity from the present 15.25 GW to 30.67 GW by 2030 and thus planning this greenfield expansion,"" said a person aware of the development. The company is currently expanding its thermal portfolio from 15.25 GW to 16.85 GW.
In 2014, Welspun Group's Welspun Energy UP Pvt Ltd was planning to set up a 1320 MW supercritical coal-based power plant in Mirzapur. However, the company was acquired by Adani Infra in 2019 and renamed Mirzapur Thermal Energy (UP) Pvt Ltd (MTEUPL).
Adani Power acquired MTEUPL from Adani Infra (India) Ltd this June.
Live Events
On June 14, it awarded the manufacture and supply contract of main plant equipment and associated auxiliaries to state-owned
Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd
(BHEL) for Rs 3500 crore.
BHEL
will also oversee the supervision of the erection and commissioning of the plant.
""MTEUPL owns land suitable for setting up a large-scale thermal power plant in the Mirzapur District of Uttar Pradesh, which will provide an opportunity for the company to expand its generation capacity as well as geographic footprint in India in pursuance of its long-term strategy,"" Adani Power said on Wednesday.
The company has also initiated the development of a 1600 MW (2X800 MW) ultra-supercritical thermal power expansion project at its existing 1,370 MW plant at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
""Capacity addition of supercritical, energy efficient thermal plants will continue to grow, with revised capacity addition projections of 80 GW+,"" Adani Power said in an analyst presentation.
India is aiming 50% installed capacity from renewables (500 GW) by 2030 to reduce the emission intensity of GDP by 45%.
On Monday, the government said it is planning an additional 80 GW coal-based power capacity with an investment of Rs 6.67 lakh crore by 2031-32 to meet growing electricity demand in the country.

Interestingly, the report mentioned that during a recent heat wave from May 17 to May 31, 2024, India's power system faced significant stress. Despite having over 140 GW of
renewable energy
(RE) capacity (excluding large hydro), only 8-10 GW of RE generation was available during evening peak periods in early May 2024.
India's power sector is poised for robust growth in the fiscal year 2025, with expectations of a healthy demand surge at approximately 6.0 per cent this fiscal.
The report highlighted the urgent need for policy intervention to avert these shortages. It suggested that deploying storage solutions combined with
solar power
could mitigate the risk. Evening peaking RE would be critical for increasing deployment by states and could work alongside technology-neutral procurement obligations for utilities.
The report also recommended achieving a solar-plus-storage cost target of Rs 3/kWh by 2027, noting that SECI (2024) auctions are already at Rs 3.41/kWh. Additionally, it advised avoiding inefficient thermal investments and focusing on energy arbitrage and ancillary services to ensure a stable power supply.

Budget 2024: Did you miss the 'nuclear option' in the budget?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/budget-2024-did-you-miss-the-nuclear-option-in-the-budget/articleshow/111961798.cms,23-07-2024,"India has found a 'small' solution to its problem of generating more clean energy. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her Budget speech that India will be setting up
Bharat Small Reactors
. After decades of opposition to nuclear energy, small reactors have become a new rage with the emphasis on
clean energy
in recent times.
As the world, gripped with the dark prospect of global warming, races to cut carbon emissions in various ways and desperately tries to produce energy from green and renewable sources such as wind and solar, it remains conflicted about
nuclear power
, an effective alternative to conventional energy from fossil fuels. The challenge of managing the nuclear waste and the possible risk of disasters at nuclear plants have made many countries wary of nuclear power, especially when green activists are forcefully advocating a turn away from it.
Small nuclear reactors
or
SMRs
are a handy option when it comes to clean energy. With up to 300 MW capacity, SMRs are flexible in design and require a smaller footprint. Being mobile and agile technology, SMRs can be factory-built unlike the conventional nuclear reactors that are built onsite.
How SMRs can revolutionise India's energy sector
In certain parts of India, the construction of large nuclear power plants (NPPs) is not economically justified, while in others, it is impossible due to territorial features and the lack of power grids. In such cases, SMRs are an excellent option.
India's current installed nuclear power capacity is 6780 MW and it plans to add 21 more atomic power generating units with a total installed capacity of 15,700 MW by 2031.Nuclear power currently comprises 3 per cent of total electricity generation. The government thinks sufficient production and share of atomic energy is essential for ensuring the country's energy security. Current policy targets a three-fold rise in nuclear installed capacity by 2031.

Budget 2024: Govt to bring in private sector for small nuclear reactors
India has set for itself a 500 GW renewable energy target by 2030. India has added a record renewable energy capacity of 18.48 GW in 2023-24, which is over 21 per cent higher than 15.27 GW a year ago.
However, industry experts say there is a need to add at least 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for the next six years to meet the ambitious target of 500 GW of renewables by 2030. India's installed renewable energy capacity is 143.64 GW as of March 31, 2024, excluding 47 GW of large hydropower capacity (each plant is more than 25 GW or above). Renewable energy capacity stood at around 190 GW, including large hydro projects, and therefore, India needs to add 310 GW in the next six years or at an average of 50 GW per annum.
In such a scenario, SMRs can revolutionise India's energy sector by not only providing power in far-flung areas but also help meet India its clean energy goals.
The business of SMRs
SMRs have been promoted as a cheaper option than legacy reactors, with shortened construction time and less fuel needed to power them, which translates into less nuclear waste. SMR players say their reactors are safer than traditional ones, with some claiming the new technology is not prone to serious incidents leading to irradiation and contamination, shielding them from a core meltdown like the one that occurred in Fukushima in 2011.

In Europe, the search for alternative sources to Russian energy during the war in Ukraine has refocused attention on smaller, easier-to-build nuclear power stations, the SMRs. UK-based Rolls-Royce SMR says its SMRs are much cheaper and quicker to get running than standard plants, delivering the kind of energy security that many nations are seeking.
Even Saudi Arabia is planning to shift from oil to nuclear energy, given its rich store of uranium which it wants to exploit for exports too.

“Advanced Ultra Supercritical projects are more expensive than conventional coal-based projects. A VGF is needed for keeping tariffs from these newer projects in tandem with existing ones so that power purchase agreements with state government-controlled distribution companies can be secured comfortably,” said a senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.
Sector watchers said the new project would cost well upwards of Rs 15,000 crore at completion.
The Centre last week announced VGF for 1 GW of the country's first offshore wind energy projects, which were recently approved for development. Last week the Union cabinet approved VGF of Rs 7,453 crore for the wind project to keep power tariffs below Rs 4.5 per unit, roughly the average cost of electricity supply from the country’s thermal plants.
India currently has 444.77 GW of power generation capacity, of which 243 GW is coal-based.
Performance of thermal power projects is measured in plant efficiency. Higher efficiency means lesser coal consumption and more power output achieved through increasing the temperature and pressure in a boiler. The AUSC technology-based
thermal power plants
will yield a plant efficiency of 46% against about 38% efficiency of subcritical and up to 42% of supercritical sets. This will be in addition to reducing coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by about 11% as compared to the most modern super-critical plants in existence.

carbon capture
utilisation and storage need to be explored to bring down the emissions from the use of coal, as per the Economic Survey 2023-24, which was tabled in Parliament.
""Coal phase-down will be heavily dependent on the import of critical minerals required for
renewable energy
and battery storage unless the country invests in the development of technologies based on domestically available mineral resources and those that enable the reuse, recovery, and recycling of critical minerals,"" it explained.
It further said the adoption of
gasification technology
in India can transform the coal sector and bring down the dependence on import of natural gas, methanol, and ammonia, and will help lower emissions.
Coal, which accounts for 70 per cent of the total electricity generation, is also a critical input in various industries, such as steel, sponge iron, cement, and paper.
""Adopting gasification technology in India can revolutionise the coal sector, reducing reliance on imports of natural gas, methanol, ammonia, and other essential products while reducing emissions,"" the Economic Survey 2023-24 said.

""DVC has always been at the forefront of setting new standards for creating a robust and sustainable power infrastructure,"" added Minister Khattar.
Earlier on Monday, he reviewed the
urban development
schemes and the power sector scenario in
Uttarakhand
.
The central government has set a target of installing 500 Giga watts (GW) of power from non-fossil fuel sources, such as solar, wind etc., by 2030 in which hydroelectric projects including Pump Storage Projects (PSP) play a vital role.
India has a hydro power potential of 133 GW, of which 42 GW (32 per cent) has been developed so far. The potential of PSP is also 133 GW, of which only 4.75 GW (3.6 per cent) has been developed so far. Similarly, Uttarakhand has a potential of 14.5 GW, of which 4 GW has been developed and 5.6 GW is under development.

The interest of the Centre and the two states is almost the same, a source said.
DVC plans to install an additional capacity of nearly 10,000 MW in thermal and green energy, ramping up its total capacity to about 16,700 MW.
This would comprise 3,720 MW of thermal power, 4,000 MW of solar power, and 2,500 MW from a pump storage power plant.
The total capex is estimated to be between Rs 50,000-60,000 crore.
The current installed capacity of DVC is nearly 6700 MW, of which 6540MW is thermal.
The minister during the meeting stressed the need to increase the
renewable energy
share in DVC's total energy portfolio.
Currently, DVC has a meagre green energy portfolio and is implementing a 310 MW solar plant with
NTPC
.
According to sources present at the meeting with the Union minister, DVC raised issues of grade slippages of coal supplies by
Coal India
subsidiaries, which have ramifications on generation cost and power tariff.
""We have also updated certain aspects of the Fuel Supply Agreement of coal to keep pace with demand. We also sought the ministry's help in signing Power Purchase Agreements for the future capacities and recovering legacy dues,"" a source said, declining to be quoted.
DVC has about Rs 300-400 crore in legacy dues out of Rs 1,000 crore with the Jharkhand state government.
DVC officials said the minister was very cooperative and assured the
Corporation
that the operational and financial issues faced by it would be resolved at both the department and government levels for the smooth and effective functioning of the corporation.
The minister also offered full support to DVC for its expansion plans and overall growth so that the Corporation can contribute significantly to the sustainable development of the nation.
Out of the DVC's total nine thermal and hydel power stations, five are in Jharkhand with the rest being located in neighbouring West Bengal.

NCLT admits GVK Power & Infra with dues of Rs 18k cr to insolvency,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nclt-admits-gvk-power-infra-with-dues-of-rs-18k-cr-to-insolvency/articleshow/111791894.cms,17-07-2024,"MUMBAI: The Hyderabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) has initiated corporate insolvency proceedings against GVK Power & Infrastructure (GPIL) in response to a petition by
ICICI Bank
and joined by five other banks seeking recovery of about Rs 18,000 crore of dues from the company.
ICICI Bank had petitioned the court in November 2020 to pursue the recovery of its $1.35 billion lent through its Dubai, Bahrain and Singapore branches along with 3 other lenders. Court documents show GPIL owes more than $2.6 billion in loans and corporate guarantees issued by lenders, mainly from foreign branches.
Besides ICICI, the other creditors to the company, mentioned in the order, are
Bank of Baroda
(Ras Al Khaimah branch),
Bank of India
(London branch),
Canara Bank
(London branch), ICICI Bank (Bahrain, Dubai and OBU branches),
Indian Overseas Bank
(large corporate branch, India) and
Axis Bank
.
In its 82-page order the court said GPIL has acknowledged its liabilities in its annual reports for fiscals 2019, 2020 and 2021 and ICICI filed its petition when the corporate guarantee was invoked and could not repay the liabilities despite repeated assurances. It also dismissed GPIL's contention that the NCLT has no jurisdiction on the issue because the loans were mostly given from foreign branches.

The company's shares lost 5% of its value and ended at Rs 10 apiece on BSE near its lower circuit. The court has appointed
Satish Kumar Gupta
as the interim resolution professional on the recommendation of ICICI. Gupta has earlier experience as the resolution professional of the erstwhile Essar Steel.
Bankers said the admission of the insolvency against the company increases the chances of recovery from the company. ""Though the assets on ground do not match the amount of loans given to the company, there is a possibility of a one-time settlement and also some value in the assets left in the company,"" said a banker aware of the details.
The latest annual report shows that the company has one gas-based and one hydro power project, namely the 464 MW GVK Gautami Power and the 330 MW Alaknanda Hydro Power besides the
GVK Jaipur Expressway
as assets.

Senior counsel K Vivek Reddy, representing ICICI, referenced a
London court
judgment from October of the previous year to support the insolvency proceedings against GVKPIL.
""The first default occurred in February 2017 and remains unresolved. GVKPIL, as the guarantor for the loan taken by GVK Coal, is liable. The London court confirmed this liability, and given GVK's failure to make any payments,
bankruptcy
is the necessary course of action,"" he stated.
In September 2011, ICICI Bank (Dubai, Bahrain, and Singapore branches), along with
Bank of Baroda
(Ras Al Khaimah),
Bank of India
(London and Singapore), and
Canara Bank
(London), sanctioned a term loan facility of Rs 8,356 crore and a letter of credit for Rs 292 crore to GVK Coal for acquiring coal mines in Australia.
Additional term loans of Rs 367 crore were sanctioned by other banks in March 2014 that was later increased to Rs 2,089 crore.
In March 2016, ICICI Bank discovered that
GVK Group
intended to sell its stake in Bangalore International Airport Ltd without lender consent, violating the facility agreements.
The banks filed an injunction application in a London court in April 2016, where GVK undertook not to sell its stake in Bengaluru airport.
Due to continued nonpayment of the loan, the lender banks filed claims before the London court for Rs 5,915 crore under facility agreement-I and Rs 1,236 crore under facility agreement-II.
In November 2020, ICICI Bank invoked its corporate guarantee, demanding Rs 5,000 crore towards principal and interest from GVKPIL.
GVKPIL expressed its inability to honour the payments but committed to repay after negotiating a solution with the Adani Group, requesting the bank to refrain from taking action, according to the order.
However, ICICI Bank proceeded to approach the NCLT in 2022 to initiate insolvency proceedings against GVKPIL. On July 12, the NCLT determined that as of June 13, 2022, GVKPIL was liable for Rs 15,576 crore, comprising Rs 9,463 crore in principal, Rs 6,113 crore in interest, and Rs 1.23 crore in agency fees.

Khattar is on a visit to the state to review the progress of Tehri Hydro Power Complex and various urban development projects in the state.
Expert committees have recommended the implementation of 21 new hydel power projects with a capacity of 2123 MW to be built on the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers and their tributaries, the chief minister said.
He requested Khattar to take positive steps towards their early implementation as only 40 per cent of the state's total hydro power generation capacity is being utilised at present.
The Union minister assured Dhami that a meeting will soon be held with the officials of the Power and Jal Shakti ministries in Delhi in the presence of the chief minister to take a call on the matter.

"Adani Power, NTPC, JSW Energy in the race for Sinnar Thermal",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-ntpc-jsw-energy-in-the-race-for-sinnar-thermal/articleshow/111736617.cms,15-07-2024,"Mumbai: Some of India's largest power producers such as
Adani Power
,
JSW Energy
,
Jindal Power
,
Vedanta Group
,
Torrent Power
and state-owned
NTPC
are among 15 companies that have submitted formal expressions of interest (EOIs) for giving a resolution plan to take over the debt-laden
Sinnar Thermal Power
near Nashik in Maharashtra.
The 1,350 MW power plant, a subsidiary of
RattanIndia Power
, was initially developed by
Indiabulls Power
. It is a rare power producer readily available in India where building a green field project is both time-consuming and costly.
Bidders have till later this month to submit an initial resolution plan, which will include a ₹10 crore deposit, people familiar with the matter said.
""The beauty of this project is that it has a huge amount of 1,600 acres, out of which just 110 acres are yet to be acquired, which means any company buying it can double capacity by adding another 1,350 MW. But coal supply was, and still remains, a problem the prospective buyer will have to deal with,"" said a person familiar with the plant.
Live Events
In December 2022, government-owned
South Eastern Coalfields
cancelled the coal supply contract with Sinnar, citing the non-availability of a power purchase agreement (PPA) and non-commissioning of the majority of units of the plant. Sinnar's PPA with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL) was cancelled a few years ago.
""Coal supply is a major challenge. Also, only one unit of 270 MW has achieved commercial operations. The rest of the four units have worked at full load for between three and seven hours only, so a lot of work needs to be done. There could also be some litigation around the land acquired. On the positive side, the company has good equipment from companies like BHEL, Kirloskar and L&T,"" said the person cited above.
Sinnar was admitted to insolvency after the bankruptcy appellate court vacated a stay to initiate corporate insolvency against the company, ET had reported in January. The plea for recovery had been filed by Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. for non-payment of dues after constructing a part of the plant.
Power Finance Corp (₹6,553 crore) and its subsidiary REC (₹5,262 crore) are the top two creditors of the company, which have total dues of ₹15,909 crore.
Punjab National Bank (PNB), Axis Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India and Life Insurance Corp (LIC) are the other creditors.
The plant, based in Sinnar Special Economic Zone (SEZ), is nearly 50 km from the city and 4 km from a national highway.
Resolution professional Rahul Jindal did not reply to an email seeking comment. Mails sent to
Adani Power
, Jindal Power, Vedanta Group,
Torrent Power
and
NTPC
also did not elicit any response. A JSW Energy spokesperson said the company had no comments to offer.
Maharashtra government-owned MSEB Holding Company, the parent of wholly-owned power production, transmission and distribution arms, could also be among the interested bidders, a second person said. MSEB Holding Co officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
The state's electricity generation company Mahagenco runs the 2,190 MW Koradi power plant near Nagpur. Mahagenco may be interested in the asset as the state may want to keep such a large power asset within its control.
It is the largest state-owned power producer in India with more than 13,000 MW of installed capacity.

Coal India to tweak e-auction norms to ease process,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/coal-india-to-tweak-e-auction-norms-to-ease-process/articleshow/111697680.cms,13-07-2024,"Coal India Ltd
(CIL) is planning to revamp its coal auction and
allocation
methodology under its
electronic window system
. The changes under discussion include capping auction window to three hours, not charging premium for changing bidders' mode of transport to road from rail, allowing a bidder to place a maximum of four bids against each basket against one bid earlier.
A concept note on the same was circulated to
e-auction
bidders on July 11 for feedback, the company said on Friday.
Reserve price in e-auction comes at a premium over notified price. Generally, coal is supplied to consumers at notified prices.
Separately, Coal India has asked all its subsidiary companies, except Northern Coalfields, to up their offered quantity under e-auction to 40% of their respective total production for the second and third quarters of FY25.
The company said it has already taken steps to ease the norms in e-auctions, like lowering the earnest money deposit and ramping up the quantities offered under the auction hammer.

Discoms
) have invested Rs 4,245 crore in infrastructure expansion and network upgrade in
Odisha
over the past 3-4 years, the company said on Friday.
The company operates four Discoms in joint ventures with the government of Odisha -
TP Central Odisha Distribution
(TPCODL), TP Western Odisha Distribution (TPWODL), TP Southern Odisha Distribution (TPSODL), and TP Northern Odisha Distribution Limited (TPNODL), collectively serving a customer base of over 9 million.
Of the total investment, Rs 1,232 crore has been allocated through various government-backed schemes. This includes laying 2,177 circuit kilometres (Ckms) of 33 kilovolt (KV) lines and 19,809 Ckms of 11 KV lines, as well as adding 30,230 distribution transformers to improve the distribution network's reliability across rural and urban areas, the company said.
Additionally, the company has commissioned 166 new primary substations (PSS), with 55 per cent of them being automated. These efforts have led to an average of 23.68 hours of
power supply
per day in urban areas and 21.98 hours in rural areas, exceeding national averages.
Furthermore, the network improvements have contributed to a reduction in Aggregate Transmission and Distribution (AT&C) losses, averaging 17.79 per cent in Odisha during the financial year 2023-24, the company added.

Delhi's electricity bills are on the rise: Here's why you might be paying more,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhis-electricity-bills-are-on-the-rise-heres-why-you-might-be-paying-more/articleshow/111652364.cms,11-07-2024,"Starting in February,
electricity bills
in
Delhi
increased due to a rise in the power purchase adjustment charge (
PPAC
), depending on the discom supplying the power. This change has come into effect from February, impacting consumers’ bills based on their region's designated discom.
""The discoms in the city have revised the PPAC in the range of 6.75 per cent to 8.75 per cent. The power purchase cost is dependent upon the prices of coal and other fuels used by generation companies and these prices recently witnessed a significant increase,"" officials told PTI.
PPAC is a surcharge provided by the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) to cover fluctuations in power purchase costs incurred by the discoms. These costs are generally affected by coal and fuel prices, which have recently seen substantial rises due to increased imports and transportation expenses.
Delhi’s power is distributed by four discoms: BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL), BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL),
Tata Power
Delhi Distribution Limited (Tata Power), and North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC). The specific increase in PPAC varies by discom. For BRPL and Tata Power, the hike is 8.75%, while for BYPL it is 6.15%. Factoring in these increases, the total PPAC now stands at 35.8% for BRPL, 37.8% for BYPL, 37.9% for Tata Power, and 38.8% for NDMC.
As per ToI illustration, a consumer using 600 units of electricity in the BRPL area will see their bill rise from Rs 4523 to Rs 4802. In a BYPL area, the bill will increase from Rs 4667 to Rs 4863. For Tata Power area consumers, the bill goes up from Rs 4588 to Rs 4867, and in the NDMC area, it will rise from Rs 4616 to Rs 4895.

This adjustment has not affected consumers who receive a subsidy for using up to 200 units. Currently, Delhi has around 65 lakh domestic electricity consumers. During winter months, from January to April, about 60 percent of these consumers do not pay for electricity as their consumption remains under 200 units, which is provided free of cost.
Delhi government provides free electricity to consumers using up to 200 units per month. A fifty per cent subsidy is provided to those having monthly consumption of 201 to 400 units.
Officials told ToI that delaying the PPAC increase could further burden consumers since it is a recovery of costs already paid.
""PPAC is a statutory mandate, and the process is very transparent and validated by the regulator. Without PPAC, discoms will have liquidity stress and won't have money to pay the generators,"" they assured.
Despite political contentions, the rise in PPAC ensures discoms sustain financial health to continue supplying uninterrupted electricity to the consumers of Delhi.
The PPAC and Delhi electricity bill
The PPAC is levied as a percentage of the base tariff that includes the fixed cost and energy charges (units consumed) by the consumers.
Power is purchased from Electricity Exchange during summers to meet increased demand to provide 24x7 power, and therefore PPAC might be greater in summers, especially due to heat waves.
The officials tols PTI as per the Ministry of Power (MOP), directions, every state regulatory commission has to place a mechanism for automatic passthrough of fuel and power procurement costs in tariff to ensure the viability of the power sector.
In the case of Delhi, there is no automatic pass through but the discoms levy PPAC only after verification and approval of DERC. It's revised on a quarterly basis, officials said.
BJP vs AAP over Delhi electricity bills
The rise in PPAC became widely known after the BJP conducted a press conference accusing the
AAP
government of increasing electricity bills.
""Delhi govt is continuously looting Delhi through electricity bills. Electricity companies are extorting a hefty amount from the public in the name of PPAC,"" said Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva.
Sachdeva argued that, ""if the govt had purchased electricity from the power grid or surplus states through an agreement before April, then prices would not have increased through May to July."" He accused the Kejriwal government of engaging in politics rather than making a power plan for summer months.
BJP
spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor added, ""the AAP govt has not increased the tariff but quietly allowed a hike in PPAC.""
Party leader Arvinder Singh Lovely criticized, ""despite promises, electricity companies have not been audited in the past 10 years under the Kejriwal govt.""
Delhi power minister Atishi countered BJP’s claims, stating that BJP was ""spreading rumors about rising
electricity prices
in the capital,"" and stated that BJP-ruled states experience the highest electricity costs and frequent power cuts.
""Under CM Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi provides 24/7 electricity at the lowest rates,"" she emphasized.
She clarified that the DERC order specifies the current PPAC will remain unchanged and, according to the Electricity Act of 2003, discoms can increase the PPAC by up to 10 percent during summer to meet higher demand.

"India races to build power plants in region claimed by China, sources say",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-races-to-build-power-plants-in-region-claimed-by-china-sources-say/articleshow/111608764.cms,09-07-2024,"India plans to spend $1 billion to expedite the construction of 12
hydropower stations
in the northeastern Himalayan state of
Arunachal Pradesh
, two government sources said, a move that could raise tensions with
China
that lays claims to the region.
The federal finance ministry under Nirmala Sitharaman recently approved up to 7.5 billion rupees ($89.85 million) in financial assistance to each
hydropower project
in the northeastern region, the sources said.
Under the scheme, about 90 billion rupees will likely be allotted for the 12 hydropower projects in Arunachal Pradesh, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter.
The scheme is likely to support northeastern states and help them finance equity holdings in the projects they host. Having state governments on board generally helps in expediting regulatory clearances, locals rehabilitation and negotiations on sharing
electricity
with the host state.
The plans for the hydropower stations are expected to be announced in the 2024/2025 federal budget that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government will unveil on July 23, the sources said, declining to be named as the information remained confidential.
Live Events
The Indian finance and
power
ministries and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Last August, the government awarded contracts to state-run firms
NHPC
, SJVNL and NEEPCO for the construction of the 11.5-gigawatt-capacity plants entailing an estimated investment of $11 billion, as part of a broader project to develop infrastructure in the border region.
None of the companies responded to a request for comments.
These
power plants
were earlier enlisted with private sector firms, but remained non-starters due to various reasons.
India has built less than 15-gigawatt hydropower plants in the last 20 years, while installations of new coal and other renewable sources of energy were nearly 10 times of the new hydropower projects.
India and China share a 2,500 km (1553.43 mile) largely un-demarcated border, over which they fought a war in 1962.
India says Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country, but China claims it is a part of southern Tibet, and has objected to other Indian infrastructure projects there.
The Indian government is pushing projects in the eastern region following reports that Beijing could construct dams on a section of the Brahmaputra river, known as the Yarlung Tsangbo in China, that flows from Tibet through Arunachal Pradesh.
India is concerned that Chinese projects in the region could trigger flash floods or create water scarcity.
Both countries are working to improve infrastructure along their border regions since clashes in western Himalayas left 20 Indian and at least four Chinese troops dead in 2020.
Last week, India Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Kazakhstan where the two agreed to step up talks to resolve issues along their border.

Turn in weather has slumped demand reflected in the prices in the day-ahead market, an industry official, who did not wish to be identified, said.
Despite maintenance shutdowns, availability of power is sufficient in accordance with the demand, he added.
Lower prices at the exchanges attract more volume trade. Since the prices slumped, volume has ticked up, the person quoted above said.
“We expect prices to remain lower than peak summer in the next two months. We do not expect pan-India high demand because that happens majorly in summer,” the person quoted above said.

landed in Russia for a visit on Monday and Tuesday -- the first time in five years. He’s expected to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin to help re-energize relations between the two countries and likely deliver strategic deals.
Russia and India are likely to agree on a long-term
uranium
supply pact for a nuclear power plant coming online in Tamil Nadu, said senior officials with knowledge of the matter.

The growing support for nuclear as a low-carbon energy source has seen uranium prices more than triple since the end of 2020, and the market could remain tight until 2029 as utilities replenish their inventories, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Cooperation in civilian nuclear sphere doesn’t fall under the US sanction regime on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
“Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant units 1 and 2 have already become operational, and the work is progressing on units 3 and 6,” India’s Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said on Friday. Moscow “remains an important partner for India’s energy security and defense,” he added.
Rosatom had previously supplied nuclear fuel to Kudankulam in 2022 and 2023.
The bulk of India’s uranium output comes from Uranium Corp. of India’s mines in the northern state of Jharkhand, where reserves are fast depleting. Efforts to exploit deposits in other states such as Andhra Pradesh and Meghalaya haven’t met expectations, increasing India’s reliance on imports.
India has spot deals for the procurement of the fuel with nations including Kazakhstan, Russia, France, Uzbekistan and Canada.
The military agreement will facilitate the exchange of fuel and spare parts for Russian warships in the Indian Ocean and Indian vessels in the Arctic — an area that has seen increased activity with new shipping routes opening up as ice caps recede.

Budget: Centre may back states in north-east hydropower play,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/budget-centre-may-back-states-in-north-east-hydropower-play/articleshow/111560107.cms,08-07-2024,"Budget 2024
: Looking to fast-track
hydropower
capacity creation, the upcoming budget could unveil funding support to north-eastern states for purchasing equity in hydropower projects, said people familiar with the matter.
The Centre could support equity participation by state governments in hydropower projects in the northeast at 24% of the total project equity, subject to a cap of Rs 750 crore per project initially, they said. “A new scheme focused on northeast is under consideration,” said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified, adding the move was part of the government’s clean energy focus.
North-eastern states that wish to have a joint venture for such projects are likely to be given financial assistance for their stake, said another person.
The government expects a significant contribution from the hydropower sector for its targets aimed at reducing emissions intensity of GDP by 45% from 2005 levels by 2030 and reaching 50% of installed power capacity from non-fossil-fuel sources.
Hydropower projects of 15 GW are under construction in the country and the capacity is likely to increase to 67 GW by 2031-32 from 42 GW.

Renewable energy is intermittent in nature and requires balancing power for grid stability. Conventional hydropower and pumped storage schemes are the best energy storage technology to integrate renewables in the grid and to stabilise it, according to a report of the parliamentary standing committee on energy.
Identified capacity in Arunachal Pradesh is the highest among states having hydropower potential, the report said.
The Centre is already providing support to states for power reforms, in the form of additional borrowing limits, as well as for capex.

The scheme is likely to be designed in a manner that gives higher interest subvention for more efficiency and energy saving.
Some of such technologies could be automation and control systems for better resource utilization and loss reduction, combustion control systems for boilers, pocket ventilation systems, air-dyeing technology, methane capture technology, among many others.
The allocation for interest subvention is likely to be to the tune of ₹2,000 crore, said an official.
""The scheme could be in phases and in the first phase it could be ₹1,000 crore. Based on the response there could be another tranche. It is being discussed,"" one of the people said.
MSMEs need support to adopt new technologies and once those technologies have got scale, the
financial support
can be withdrawn, another person said. The energy efficient technologies may be linked with certain threshold energy savings. Energy efficiency has been at the forefront of the power as well as renewable energy ministries in the wake of rising consumption in the country.
The proposal to offer financial support to MSMEs and other establishments has been in the works for some time and may finally be taking shape, according to the persons.

What should the budget do
The upcoming budget should focus on several key areas to enhance the power sector. It should provide incentives for energy transition technologies, encouraging the adoption of cleaner and more efficient energy solutions. Additionally, efforts in carbon capture and utilisation should be incentivised to reduce emissions. A significant push for investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure is necessary to improve the efficiency and reliability of power delivery. Furthermore, offering incentives for coal gasification projects can help diversify energy sources and reduce dependence on traditional coal-burning methods.

India asks utilities to order $33 billion in equipment this year to boost coal power output,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-asks-utilities-to-order-33-billion-in-equipment-this-year-to-boost-coal-power-output/articleshow/111456136.cms,03-07-2024,"India
has asked
power
companies to order
equipment
worth $33 billion this year to fast track capacity additions of coal-fired power in the years ahead, as the South Asian nation struggles to meet booming electricity demand, two government officials said.
The unprecedented move by the government, which would result in record tendering in a year for the equipment by major power firms such as state-run
NTPC
and
SJVN
as well as by private companies
Adani Power
and Essar Power, will help add 31 gigawatts (GW) in the next 5-6 years, the sources said.
Normally, the government leaves the tendering timing to the companies themselves.
Expediting equipment orders for new coal-fired plants was discussed at a meeting held by Power Minister Manohar Lal, soon after the formation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal cabinet early last month, the sources said.
The targets are ambitious given the country has ordered equipment for about 2-3 GW capacity annually in prior years, barring last year's orders for 10 GW.

India is rushing to add fresh coal-fired plants as it is barely able to meet high power demand with the existing fleet in non-solar hours.
Post pandemic, the country's power demand scaled new records on the back of the fastest rate of economic growth among major economies and increased instances of heatwaves.
India saw its biggest power shortfall in 14 years in June, and had to race to avoid night time outages by deferring planned plant maintenance, and invoking an emergency clause to mandate companies to run plants based on imported
coal
and power.
State-run Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), which bagged all power equipment contracts in auctions in the last year, is likely to get most of the contracts for the new equipment, the sources said.
Larsen & Toubro, the only other power equipment producer in the market, had not participated in most of last year's bids, they said.
The Power Ministry, BHEL, Adani, NTPC, SJVN and L&T did not immediately respond to emails sent by Reuters. The sources did not want to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media.
""The last large orders for power equipment were placed for about 20 GW around 2009-10 when Chinese companies bagged a major pie,"" one of the sources said.
Policy flip-flops and lack of orders for coal-based plants over the past several years forced other equipment suppliers such as Thermax-Babcock, BGR-Hitachi and South Korea's Doosan to shut their manufacturing units in India.
The country, since 2020, discourages contracts with companies in countries sharing a land border such as China by mandating regulatory approvals.
Since late last year, India has fast tracked coal-fired power plants to meet its power needs, threatening to undermine progress made by the world's No.3 greenhouse gas emitter in weaning its economy off carbon.
In March Reuters reported private Indian firms have expressed interest in building at least 10 GW of coal-fired power capacity over a decade, ending a six-year drought in significant private involvement in the sector.

Peak power demand declines 10% to 206GW as rains hit north India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/peak-power-demand-declines-10-to-206gw-as-rains-hit-north-india/articleshow/111412662.cms,01-07-2024,"Heavy
rain
pounding the northern parts of the country after a spate of
heatwave
brought down the peak
power demand
in the past three days, bringing much relief from record consumption. Peak power demand fell to 206 GW on June 30 from 216-230 GW a week before and the highest ever of 250 GW on May 30.
The
India Meteorological Department
has predicted heavy rainfall in many parts of the country in the next two to five days with no significant change in maximum temperatures during this period. June saw heatwaves across the country, especially in the northern region in the second half. Record high temperatures led to the highest ever demand in the northern region at 89 GW.
The month's total
electricity consumption
was 152.4 billion units, up 9% year-on-year. On a month-on-month basis, the consumption was marginally lower than 156.33 billion units in May because of the onset of monsoon in the southern region in June, according to an industry executive, while the previous month saw high temperatures across the country. The power ministry said that the northern region had been experiencing high demand conditions due to a heatwave since May 17. Nonetheless, the highest ever
peak demand
of 89 GW in the region was successfully met on June 17. About 25-30% of the region's power requirement came from neighbouring regions. Coal stocks at plants have however remained higher than last year since the beginning of 2024-25.
ET Bureau
Stocks at thermal plants totalled 46.7 million tonnes as on June 29, about 32% higher year-on-year.
Coal India Ltd
(CIL) said its supplies in the summer months were higher than last year. ""CIL's supplies to the coal fired plants grew by 4% to 160 million tonnes during Q1,"" the company said.
NTPC
recorded power generation of 113.87 billion units in the quarter to June, an increase of 9.5% year-on-year.

India's power consumption rises nearly 9pc to 152.38 billion units in June,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-rises-nearly-9pc-to-152-38-billion-units-in-june/articleshow/111403844.cms,01-07-2024,"New Delhi: India's
power consumption
rose by nearly 9 per cent to 152.38 billion units (BU) in June compared to the year-ago period mainly due to scorching heat which forced excessive use of cooling appliances like
air conditioners
and desert coolers. In June 2023, the power consumption stood at 140.27 BU, according to official data.
The highest supply in a day (peak power demand met) also rose to 245.41 GW in June 2024 against 223.29 GW in the year-ago month. The peak power demand was recorded at 224.10 GW in June 2023.
The peak power demand touched an all-time high of 250.20GW in May this year. The previous all-time high peak power demand of 243.27 GW was recorded in September 2023.
Earlier this year, the
power ministry
projected a peak power demand of 235 GW during daytime and 225 GW during evening hours for May and 240 GW during daytime and 235 GW during evening hours for June 2024.
The ministry also estimated that peak power demand may hit 260 GW this summer.
Live Events
Experts said the scorching heat and
humidity
in the later part of June due to the arrival of
monsoon
rains in many party of the country forced people to excessively use cooling appliances like air conditioners and desert coolers.
This lead to increase in power consumption as well as growth in power demand in the country, they pointed out.
The demand for power as well as consumption will continue to be steady in coming days due to high humidity which make use air conditioners inevitable, they said.
According to the
Indian Meteorological Department
(
IMD
), the conditions are favourable for further advance of
Southwest Monsoon
into remaining part of Rajasthan, Punjab and
Haryana
during the next 2-3 days.
Monsoon is likely to cover the entire country in the next three days, as per the latest bulletin on Monday.

"Continue blending of 4 per cent imported coal till October 15, government tells power plants",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/continue-blending-of-4-per-cent-imported-coal-till-october-15-government-tells-power-plants/articleshow/111345865.cms,28-06-2024,"New Delhi: The government has asked domestic coal-based
thermal power
producers to continue blending imported fuel until October 15, and reduced proportion of blending to 4 per cent from six per cent to ensure uninterrupted
electricity supply
during summer. The move will ensure adequate supply of dry fuel at
power plants
to meet electricity demand while reducing the use of
imported coal
, according to the
power ministry
.
In order to meet the power demand during the crucial
monsoon months
and to ensure uninterrupted power supply across the country, adequate coal reserves in domestic coal based plants (DCBs) need to be maintained by all the central/state gencos (power generation companies) and IPPs (independent power producers), the Union power ministry said in its latest advisory.
In an earlier direction issued in March 2024, the power ministry had allowed all thermal power plants to blend up to six per cent of imported coal with domestic fuel till June this year.
The ministry has ""decided to extend the advisory dated 04.03.2024 by modifying the blending requirerment to 4 per cent (by weight) till 15.10.2024"", said the fresh advisory dated June 27.
However, the said advisory will not be applicable to domestic coal based (DCB) plants located within a radius of 200 kms from the linked mine/coal source.
Live Events
The power minister on June 13 reviewed the position of coal stocks at DCB plants.
The peak power demand has already touched the highest-ever level of of 250 GW in May 2024.
Although there is a significant improvement in rake loading as well as receipt of domestic coal in the first quarter of FY25 compared to Q1 of FY24, there is still a gap between receipt and consumption of coal at the level of DCB plants of around 1,30,000 tonnes per day. This gap is partly made up with import of coal.
""...due to various logistical issues, the domestic coal supply declines during monsoons. This year also, while the average rake loading in Q1 till date is around 432 rakes per day, Railways have informed about the likely availability of around 403 rakes per day in Q2,"" the ministry said.

Delhi's peak power demand grew 3.8x on hot and humid days in last 12 months: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhis-peak-power-demand-grew-3-8x-on-hot-and-humid-days-in-last-12-months-report/articleshow/111334356.cms,28-06-2024,"NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded a sizable jump in temperature-related
electricity demand
in the last 12 months, with peak demand rising by an average of 711 megawatts (MW) on the hottest and most humid days, according to a new analysis published on Friday. The report by the independent think tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said Delhi's peak
power demand
rose by an average of 506 MW on cold and dry days but only by 188 MW on days when the temperature and humidity were moderate. The analysis used wet-bulb temperature (WBT) as a yardstick.
The wet-bulb temperature (WBT) is the lowest temperature to which a person or object can be cooled solely by the evaporation of water.
""On moderate days (17.5 degrees Celsius WBT), Delhi's peak demand grew by a modest 188 megawatts (MW), but on the hottest and most humid days (using 32.5 degrees Celsius WBT as a criterion), the annual increase was 3.8 times higher at 711 MW,"" the report said.
At the other end of the temperature scale, the increase was smaller on very cold and dry days (7.5 degrees Celsius WBT) but still significant at 506 MW, or 2.7 times higher than the increase on moderate days.
This suggests that Delhi's recent power demand growth can largely be attributed to cooling and heating, with more year-round factors (such as those related to economic growth) playing a far smaller role.

The analysis also revealed a marked increase in the number of very hot and humid days (using 30 degrees Celsius WBT as a threshold).
""There were 24 such hot and humid days in 2022-23, which jumped to 40 days in the 12-month period just completed,"" it said.
WBTs above 35 degrees Celsius have been considered impossible to survive in for more than a few hours.
""Temperature levels which directly threaten human health have been surpassed far more often in this year's
heatwave
. Cooling on such days is no luxury; it is life-saving, and reliably meeting electricity demand is of utmost importance,"" the note's author, Charles Worringham, a guest contributor at IEEFA, said.
Given that heatwaves may soon become the norm, the burden of power generation cannot be borne solely by thermal plants, which are operating closer to full capacity than in recent years. IEEFA suggests that India should ramp up utility-scale solar rather than boost thermal capacity.
Worringham said that moderating the rate of growth in power demand is also an urgent goal. This includes prioritising challenging yet vital programmes at the central and state levels to improve energy efficiency for buildings, as well as encouraging demand-side management initiatives through flexible tariffs and other incentives to curb the growth in peak demand.
A prolonged heatwave drove the national capital's peak power demand to 8,647 MW on June 19, the highest-ever for the city, according to power discom (distribution companies) officials.
Delhi, which has experienced 40 consecutive days of temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius since May 13, recorded around 60 heat-related deaths this year, according to media reports.

India keen to speed up power grid link talks with Sri Lanka,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-keen-to-speed-up-power-grid-link-talks-with-sri-lanka/articleshow/111322763.cms,28-06-2024,"New Delhi:
India
is keen to fast-track longstanding talks with
Sri Lanka
on setting up a
power grid link
between the two neighbours for
electricity trading
, especially
renewable energy
.
The aim is to eventually sign a memorandum of understanding between state-owned
Power Grid Corporation of India
and Sri Lanka's
Ceylon Electricity Board
, said people familiar with the matter. ""Discussion is still going on with the Sri Lankan government on the grid connectivity project,"" an Indian government official said. The grid connectivity project is being planned through both overhead and under-sea cables, a second official added.
Power Grid didn't respond to ET's queries.
The cross-border interconnection plan has been under discussion for nearly two decades, but high project cost has made it unviable. Discussions got a fresh thrust last year amid India's plans to have grid interconnectivity with countries such as Saudi Arabia and UAE. After getting a new direction in the talks last fiscal, the Ceylon Electricity Board assigned a financial analysis study to PwC India for assessing the likely economic benefits of the project to Sri Lanka. PwC's draft report had suggested the link to be financially beneficial, as reported earlier by ET.
The study had suggested a mix of long-term, medium-term, and short-term tie ups for securing power from various available sources. Sri Lanka's power and energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera told ET in February that technical feasibility studies have been done and a joint consultant for investment decisions would be appointed for the grid connectivity project. The renewed focus on power interconnectivity with Sri Lanka gains importance in the backdrop of India's push to forge closer ties with its neighbours.

""Advanced Ultra Supercritical projects are more expensive than conventional coal-based projects. A VGF is needed for keeping tariffs from these newer projects in tandem with existing ones so that power purchase agreements with state government-controlled distribution companies can be secured comfortably,"" said a senior government official, who did not wish to be identified. Sector watchers said the new project would cost well upwards of ₹15,000 crore at completion. The Centre last week announced VGF for 1 GW of the country's first offshore wind energy projects, which were recently approved for development. Last week the Union cabinet approved VGF of ₹7,453 crore for the wind project to keep power tariffs below ₹4.5 per unit, roughly the average cost of electricity supply from the country's
thermal plants
.India currently has 444.77 GW of
power generation capacity
, of which 243 GW is coal-based.
Performance of thermal power projects is measured in plant efficiency. Higher efficiency means lesser coal consumption and more power output achieved through increasing the temperature and pressure in a boiler. The AUSC technology-based thermal power plants will yield a plant efficiency of 46% against about 38% efficiency of subcritical and up to 42% of supercritical sets. This will be in addition to reducing coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by about 11% as compared to the most modern super-critical plants in existence.

'
Higher Standards
in Gear'
Equipment should be rated for higher
ambient temperatures
of above 40 degree Celsius and have insulation materials that can withstand them without degrading, said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner and leader, power and ESG, PwC India. Equipment should also have systems that can monitor conditions for critical parameters like temperature, load and vibration, he added.
India plans to have 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.
The official cited above said the
transmission equipment
industry has moved to higher standards to deal with such temperatures. ""On the transmission side, the geographical temperatures are taken into consideration while designing equipment based on years of data,"" said an official who did not want to be identified.
PwC's Mohapatra said ensuring adequate ventilation in substations and transformer yards would be necessary to overcome high temperature-related issues.
According to a Power Grid Corp of India official, the utility has a robust system that's been designed to work in high temperatures. ""Advance preparations are made for the summer season, when increase in temperature generally results in increase in load,"" the official said. Proactive measures like regular patrolling and deployment of thermovision cameras are in place to detect any rise in temperature as part of several such initiatives, he said.

BSES
, a leading power distribution company in
Delhi
, has unveiled India's largest utility-scale Battery
Energy Storage System
(BESS). This state-of-the-art system guarantees continuous
electricity
supply to residential areas, even in the event of technical faults or grid failures.
The BESS project, currently under construction at BSES Rajdhani's Kilokari substation in south Delhi, is a pioneering initiative in India's energy sector. Once operational, it will serve as an alternative power source during local outages, ensuring uninterrupted electricity supply to the area. BSES
Rajdhani
has obtained approval from the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) to proceed with the project, which is expected to be commissioned within 10-12 months. Following its launch, the project will expand to cover more residential areas, benefiting a larger population.
According to officials, the BESS project is designed to address the challenges posed by extreme variations in electricity demand. It aims to improve
power supply
, reduce network overloading, and enhance
grid stability
. Additionally, it will help lower power procurement costs and facilitate the integration of
renewable energy

The right of way in power transmission is generally a strip of land required for constructing, maintaining and protecting the line. It does not require land acquisition, but it is a state subject.
“This compensation will address the potential
diminution of land value
due to the presence of overhead lines or underground cables within the RoW corridor,” the power ministry said in a notification dated June 14.
The step will help expedite transmission projects and help the government to add lines at a faster pace for upcoming power capacities, including renewables, two industry officials said.
“Even in cases where the compensation for RoW has been settled above circle rates, it has not been able to reach market rates,” an industry official said.
Transmission projects are spread across rural and urban areas, including the country’s vast farmlands.
The diminution of land value because of the transmission project plays a major role in compensation tussles, leading to a delay in projects and hike in costs.
The new guidelines with increased compensation for RoW may prove to be more beneficial as delays cause higher loss, one of the industry officials said.
The norms provide compensation be paid one time and upfront and encourage digital transactions.
However, states can issue their own modified guidelines for determining compensation.

However, it stated that ICRA's outlook for the power distribution segment remains ""Negative"" amid limited tariff hikes and continued loss-making operations.
According to the statement, ICRA projects the all-India thermal PLF level to rise marginally to 70 per cent in FY2025, from 69 per cent in FY2024, led by the growth in electricity demand and limited thermal capacity addition.
The rating agency projects the full-year demand growth for FY2025 at 6 per cent, slightly lower than its expectation for the GDP growth for this fiscal (6.8 per cent).

While this trails the growth of 7.6 per cent reported in FY2024, it remains higher than the historical average seen over the past 10 years.
The healthy growth in electricity demand over the past three years has necessitated a rethink on thermal capacity addition, with the government looking to encourage new thermal power projects, including private sector participation, it stated.
Vikram V, Vice President & Co-Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said in the statement that ICRA expects the generation capacity addition to increase to 30 GW in FY2025 from 25 GW in FY2024, with the overall installed power generation capacity surpassing 470 GW by March 2025.
The thermal segment is expected to add 5.0-5.5 GW capacity in FY2025, with the balance 25 GW contributed by the renewable energy (RE) segment, he added.
While the RE segment would remain the key driver of the generation capacity addition going forward, ICRA expects the thermal segment to witness new project announcements, given the healthy demand growth, he stated.

India's coal-based power demand at all-time high,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-coal-based-power-demand-at-all-time-high/articleshow/111112897.cms,19-06-2024,"India's demand for coal-based power has risen by 7.3% this fiscal year to an all-time high, the government said in a statement on Wednesday.
Peak demand for power in India's hot, arid northern plains hit a record earlier this week, even as the government said it continues to implement measures to meet high energy consumption.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted above-normal temperatures for June in the northwest and central parts of the country, making it one of the longest heatwave spells.
Cumulative coal production stood at 207.48 million tonnes as of June 16, a growth of 9.27% from the same period last year, the government said in a release.
More than 75% of India's power generation was from coal in 2023, while gas-fired plants have accounted for only about 2% in recent years, largely because of the high cost of gas relative to coal.

Multiple-tripping incidents reported in northern region as power demand shoots up to 89.4 GW,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/multiple-tripping-incidents-reported-in-northern-region-as-power-demand-shoots-up-to-89-4-gw/articleshow/111112018.cms,19-06-2024,"New Delhi: Multiple-tripping incidents were reported in the northern region on Monday after power demand shot up to 89.4 gigawatt (GW), leading to a supply gap of 16.5 GW, as per a Northern Regional Load Despatch Centre (NRLDC) report. Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and J&K were the affected states, the report said.
NRLDC is a part of the National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC), which under the Union Ministry of Power, is responsible for scheduling and dispatch of electricity over the inter-regional links.
""At 13:53, northern region demand experienced a reduction in load of the order of 16.5 GW. The incident occurred immediately after the tripping of both bipoles of +/-800 kV HVDC Champa (WR) - Kurukshetra (NR) which was carrying 4,500 MW from the Western Region to the Northern Region. After tripping of the HVDC link, low voltages were observed across the northern region and the above load reduction occurred,"" NRLDC said.
A partial outage of the 765/400kV Aligarh (PGCIL) station occurred due to the reported tripping of five 765 kV lines. Prior to the event, the net import of NR was 15,500 MW and a demand of 89,410 MW was being catered.
Loads were gradually restored considering low voltages and high loading on 765 KV Agra-Gwalior lines. System load was restored to near normal level by 14.30 hours. All the transmission elements which tripped were restored by 16:00 hours.

The previous highest peak power demand of Delhi was 8,302 MW on May 29 this year. Delhi's peak power demand reached 8,000 MW for the first time on May 22, 2024, they said.
The extreme heatwave continues to push the city's power demand northwards, soaring to 8,647 MW at 3:22 pm on Tuesday, according to the State Load Dispatch Centre, Delhi.
The cooling load due to the increased use of
air conditioners
and coolers amid the relentless heat wave has led to a record rise in power demand in the national capital. Since May 22, Delhi's peak power demand has crossed 8,000 MW eight times so far, discom officials said.
""The power demand can be attributed to weather conditions that led residents to use more air conditioning and cooling appliances, pushing electricity consumption. It is estimated that air conditioning can contribute to 30-50 per cent of domestic and commercial power consumption,"" said a discom official.
The national capital on Tuesday recorded a minimum temperature of 33.8 degrees Celsius, six notches above the season's average. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 45 degrees Celsius, weather department officials said.

In Delhi, which is facing a water shortage, the highest daily temperatures have stayed above 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) since May 12 and are forecast to fall below that mark only on June 26.
The ministry said it was able to supply power to the northern parts by importing 25-30% from neighbouring regions and urging all utilities to minimize forced outages of equipment.
This summer has seen a record peak 250GW demand for power throughout the country, with the ministry implementing various measures as the need for air conditioners and other cooling appliances rises.
The IMD expects some respite from the heat from Thursday although the monsoon has delivered a fifth less rain than normal so far this season.
Sweltering heat and policy measures have fuelled a surge in the use of gas-fired power, with power generation doubling in April and May to 8.9 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) compared with the same period last year, according to data from Grid India.

power
ministry has announced it has directed all utilities to ""maintain a high state of alert and minimize forced equipment outages"" due to the increased electricity demand driven by the ongoing heatwave, particularly in the northern region where the monsoon has yet to arrive.
The ministry's statement highlighted that the northern region has faced high electricity demand since May 17, 2024, due to the heatwave. Despite these tough conditions, the highest-ever peak demand of 89 GW in the northern region was successfully met on June 17, 2024.
This was achieved by importing 25-30 percent of the region's power needs from neighboring regions, the ministry noted.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts that heatwave conditions in North-West India will ease starting June 20.
To meet the rising electricity demand and ensure an adequate power supply across the country, the Ministry of Power has taken several steps to handle the record peak demand of 250 GW this
summer
.
Live Events
The ministry projects that peak demand could reach 260 GW during this season.
These measures include directives under Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003, mandating imported coal-based (ICB) plants to continue providing generation support during periods of high demand.
The ministry has directed power generating units to minimize planned maintenance during this period.
Efforts are being made to minimize partial and forced outages to maximize the availability of generation capacity. Plants on long-term outages have been encouraged to revive their units to ensure maximum power generation.
All generating companies (GENCOs) have been advised to keep their plants in good condition to ensure full capacity availability for the optimal operation of various generation sources.
Regarding coal stock maintenance, the ministry stated that adequate coal stocks are being maintained at coal-based thermal stations.
Hydro stations have received guidance to conserve water during hours of high solar output. They are encouraged to maximize power generation when solar energy is less available to ensure a steady power supply around the clock.
Gas-based power plants are being directed to support the grid under Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003. About 860 MW of extra gas-based capacity from non-NTPC sources has also been secured through competitive bidding for the summer season.
Additionally, approximately 5,000 MW of NTPC gas-based capacity has been placed on standby. This capacity is ready to operate immediately if required.
Surplus power from generating stations, when not requisitioned, is to be offered in the market. This is in line with the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022, and any amendments. This allows any buyer to utilize the available power from the market.
States also have the option to arrange power exchanges with other states that have surplus capacity through the PUShP portal.

Adani Electricity cuts power supply of 100 homes in Mumbai. Here's why,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-electricity-cuts-power-supply-of-100-homes-in-mumbai-heres-why/articleshow/111017982.cms,15-06-2024,"Adani Electricity
has disconnected power supply to 100 homes in
Mumbai
's
Chembur
, as per a report in the Times of India.
As per the report, Adani Electricity took the step amid mounting dues from 1100 families which have swelled to whopping Rs 115 crore. The defaulters, the report added, have not paid their dues since last 19 years, since 2005.
After the disconnection, the families in Siddharth Colony, Chembur, demanded restoration on humanitarian grounds.
According to Adani Electricity, these defaulters, among the highest in any colony within their service areas, have not paid their electricity bills since 2005. The amount owed has increased due to interest and penalties.
A similar incident occurred in 2019 when power was disconnected after residents stopped paying their bills. Many believed that their dues would be cleared by developers once the slums and chawls were redeveloped. This led to protests outside the Adani office in Tilak Nagar, including some residents going on a hunger strike. The power was reconnected following intervention by political parties and discussions with Adani and government officials.

An official mentioned that the agreement at the time stated that individual consumers would be responsible for past and future bills. ""Since 2019, of the 3,500 families in the colony, almost 70% have become regular paying consumers. But the remaining continue to take electricity supply without paying. In fact, our survey showed that some of these families have high consumption levels with multiple air-conditioners, televisions, and other appliances,"" he said.
In a statement, Adani Electricity said, ""When residents refuse to pay for electricity, it places an unfair burden on our other customers who regularly pay their bills on time... While we are committed to finding sustainable solutions and supporting the community, residents must understand they cannot evade their responsibility to pay for the electricity they consume.""

Electricity in Punjab to cost more as PSERC hikes power tariff by 10-15 paise per unit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/electricity-in-punjab-to-cost-more-as-pserc-hikes-power-tariff-by-10-15-paise-per-unit/articleshow/111000912.cms,14-06-2024,"Chandigarh: Electricity charges are set to cost more in Punjab with the power regulator PSERC announcing an increase in power tariff by 10 to 15 paise per unit for different categories of consumers. For the domestic category, the hike in power tariff is 10-12 paise a unit while for the industry category, the increase is 15 paise a unit.
The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) on Friday announced a new tariff order which will be effective from June 16 till March 31, 2025.
The PSERC said minimal increase in the charges was made to ensure that the consumers do not feel burdened.
In Punjab, the domestic consumers get 300 units of free electricity per month. However, the electricity consumers using over 300 units per month will have to bear the burden on account of increase in the power tariff.
In the new tariff order, the rates for domestic consumers having load up to 2 Kilo Watt (KW) with 0-100 units slab have been increased from Rs 4.19 a unit to Rs 4.29.

For 101-300 units, the new rate will be Rs 6.76 per unit, an increase of 12 paise a unit.
However, for more than 300 units, the rate of Rs 7.75 per unit has remained unchanged.
For those having a load between 2 KW and 7 KW, the new rates for up to 100 units of consumption will be Rs 4.54 per unit and for 101 to 300 units, the new rate will be Rs 6.76 a unit.
There is no change in electricity rate for the domestic consumers having a load more than 7 KW.
The fixed charges for the domestic consumers were not changed, according to the order.
The electricity rates have not been revised for the non-residential supply category.
For the industry category, the new rate for units having up to 20 Kilo Volt Amperes (KVA) load has been revised upward by 15 paise per unit from Rs 5.67 to Rs 5.82, while from 20 KVA to 100 KVA load, the rate has been increased from Rs 6.10 per unit to Rs 6.25.
Similarly, from 100 KVA to 2,500 KVA load, the electricity charges have been increased by 15 paise a unit.
The fixed charges for the industry have also been increased by Rs 5 per KVA.
The tariff for the farm sector (agriculture pumpset) has been raised from Rs 6.55 per unit to Rs 6.70 a unit.
The farmers in Punjab get free electricity supply.
Power utility Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had sought Aggregate Revenue Requirement (ARR) of Rs 53,360.48 crore projecting that it has a
revenue deficit
of Rs 5,419.82 crore. The PSPCL had requested for an increase in tariff accordingly.
However, the PSERC determined a revenue gap of Rs 654.35 crore after the requisite and thorough prudence check and allowing for previous period dues of Rs 4,072.27 crore.
The Commission determined an additional revenue requirement of Rs 654.35 crore instead of Rs 5,419.82 crore sought by the PSPCL.
The average cost of supply (ACoS) for the financial year 2024-25 works out to be 715.55 paise per kWh (kilowatt hours), which is 1.59 per cent higher than the ACoS of 704.34 paise per kWh as determined in the previous tariff order, resulting in an increase of approximately 11 paise a unit over the average cost of supply of 2023-24.
Accordingly, the ARR determined for 2024-25 will be Rs 44,239.14 crore and the projected net revenue to PSPCL from the announced tariff during financial year 2024-25 will be Rs 48,467.72 crore.

Adani Group
unit that controls a major Australian
coal port
has obtained a private credit loan of about A$500 million ($333 million), according to people familiar with the matter.
The company North Queensland Export Terminal Pty Ltd. got the loan from Farallon Capital Management and King Street Capital Management, said people who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Spokespeople at an Australian
Adani
group company, Farallon and King Street declined to comment.
Australian coal-related companies are increasingly turning to higher interest-rate private loans as banks globally become more reluctant about providing financing to commodity-related companies due to ESG concerns. Sydney-based coal miner Whitehaven Coal Ltd. earlier this year secured a $1.1 billion loan to buy two mines, attracting 17 private credit lenders and only one bank, while a consortium led by Golden Energy and Resources Pte Ltd., controlled by Indonesia’s Widjaja family, has also sounded out direct lenders.
The proceeds of the private loan obtained by Adani’s North Queensland Export Terminal are to be used to refinance existing debt, according to the people. An Adani Group representative also declined to comment.
North Queensland Export Terminal is a part of Bravus Australia, an Adani Group company which runs integrated energy and infrastructure services in Australia. North Queensland Export Terminal acquired a 99-year leasehold operation of the terminal from a Queensland Government entity in June 2011.

Empowering Communities Through a New Cooperative Solar Ownership Structure – “Community Solar”,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/empowering-communities-through-a-new-cooperative-solar-ownership-structure-community-solar/articleshow/110804286.cms,07-06-2024,"In the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, “Community Solar” emerges as a beacon of promise, especially in a country as diverse and energy hungry as India. The concept revolves around shared solar power systems, where multiple individuals or organizations invest in and benefit from a larger solar array, typically located offsite or shared among rooftops.
One of the primary advantages of community solar lies in economies of scale. By pooling resources and investing in a larger system, participants can enjoy lower equipment costs per unit of energy produced. This reduction in costs is pivotal in making solar energy more affordable and accessible to a wider population, including rural communities that often face energy poverty.
Urban areas, despite their limited space and high energy demands, can significantly contribute to the community solar movement. Through rooftop sharing initiatives, urban dwellers can collaborate to install solar panels on their buildings, offsetting their own energy costs while also contributing to the larger grid. This not only promotes sustainability but also fosters a sense of community and collective responsibility towards environmental stewardship.
These advantages and the potential to achieve clean energy equity for multifamily home dwellers have led to tremendous growth in community solar in the USA:
How does a Community Solar Project Work?
A community solar project is a small, shared solar power system where 3-4 households use electricity from one rooftop solar panel. This panel produces about 250 to 400 watts and generates around 1.5 kilowatt-hours of energy per day, enough to meet many household needs. People join these projects by signing contracts and paying fees.
Source: envirocivil.com
There are four main roles in a community solar project:
Host
: Owns the property where the solar panel is installed.
Sponsor
: Manages subscriptions and coordinates with the utility company.
Utility
: Measures the energy produced and distributes it through the electricity grid.
Subscribers
: Individuals, businesses, nonprofits, or local governments that buy a share of the electricity generated.
Sometimes, community solar projects have ""anchor tenants"" - large customers like local businesses, nonprofits, or municipal bodies that use a big portion of the solar power.
India's Push for Community Solar with MNRE
India as a country has witnessed a massive increase in solar deployment over the years, supported by a combination of economic factors and government initiatives.
Community solar could follow a similar trend with the right incentive structures in place.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) plays a key role in fostering community solar in India. Here's how MNRE is propelling this movement:
National Solar Mission (NSM)
: This flagship program aims for large-scale solar power integration. A key component is promoting rooftop solar installations, which can directly contribute to community solar projects. The NSM has set ambitious targets for solar capacity addition, indirectly encouraging community solar as a means to achieve these goals.
Draft Guidelines for Rooftop Solar PV Systems (2019)
: These guidelines by MNRE specifically mention community solar as a viable model for rooftop installations. They outline potential structures for such projects, including Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) managing rooftop solar for member buildings.
Net Metering Policy
: This policy allows prosumers (those who both produce and consume electricity) to sell excess solar power back to the grid. This incentivizes participation in community solar projects, as members can benefit from net metering by collectively generating solar power.
Existing Deployment
While widespread deployment is still evolving, there are some notable examples of community solar projects in India:
Modhera Solar City Project:
This pilot project by MNRE aims for 100% solarization of Modhera town in Gujarat. This could pave the way for similar community-driven solar initiatives in other parts of India.
Community Solar Programs by DISCOMs:
Several Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) are launching community solar programs. These programs allow consumers to subscribe to solar power generated by a shared solar installation.
The Road Ahead
With MNRE's supportive policies and growing pilot projects, community solar in India holds immense potential. Continued efforts are needed to streamline regulations, raise awareness, and develop robust financing models to unlock the full potential of this approach. By empowering communities to embrace solar energy, India can achieve its renewable energy goals while ensuring equitable access to clean power.
“To further leverage community solar for rural electrification, strategic policy interventions are crucial. One effective strategy involves incentivizing urban residents or businesses to invest in community solar projects located in rural areas. Through tax credits, subsidies, or preferential tariffs, the government can encourage wealthier urban populations to fund solar power plants in underserved rural regions. This not only stimulates investment in renewable energy but also enhances energy access and reliability in rural communities. Moreover, promoting decentralized solar power generation through community projects can reduce the need for extensive transmission line buildouts to rural areas. By generating electricity closer to the point of consumption, communities can enjoy more stable power supply, mitigate transmission losses, and alleviate strain on the grid during peak demand periods.”
stated Gautham Ramesh, a Principal Engineer at a renewable energy developer and an expert in solar energy technologies.
In conclusion, community solar holds immense potential in India's energy landscape, offering a pathway to sustainable development, energy equity, and economic growth. By leveraging economies of scale, encouraging urban participation, and implementing supportive policies, India can harness the power of the sun to empower communities, bridge energy disparities between urban and rural areas, and pave the way towards a cleaner, brighter future for all.

had already received interest from 12 prospective resolution applicants. ""Application is without merit and frivolous and dismissed with costs,"" the tribunal said.
The resolution professional (
RP
) of KSK Mahanadi had argued that the change of circumstance-KSK Mahanadi undergoing corporate insolvency resolution process (
CIRP
) on a standalone basis-requires fresh bidding.
In April, the NCLT lifted a stay on the CIRP of KSK Mahanadi, backing the decision of the CoC that had approved KSK Mahanadi's CIRP as a separate entity rather than combining it with other two entities of KSK Mahanadi that are also undergoing CIRP.
Earlier, the
lenders
favoured a collective CIRP, hoping it would fetch them better value for the three entities. The other two entities were KSK Mahanadi Water and Raigarh Champa Rail.

Megha Engineering's counsel contended that RP had failed to provide a reason for fresh bidding and violated rules under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) by not seeking NCLT's nod before inviting a fresh round of bidding.
Further, the counsel pointed out that all prominent power companies such as
Adani Power
,
Jindal Power
and
Vedanta Ltd
have already submitted their bids in the first round.
The tribunal was wary of interfering with the CoC's commercial wisdom unless the CoC's decision was capricious or arbitrary. The second round of bidding has drawn the likes of
Coal India Ltd
and NTPC Ltd to the CIRP of KSK Mahanadi Power.

Scorching heat drives India's gas-fired power use to multi-year highs in May,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/scorching-heat-drives-indias-gas-fired-power-use-to-multi-year-highs-in-may/articleshow/110758197.cms,06-06-2024,"Sweltering heat and policy measures are fuelling a surge in the use of
gas-fired power
in
India
, with imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) forecast to rise sharply over the next two years, industry officials and experts say.
The country's gas-fired
power generation
doubled in April and May to 8.9 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) compared with the same period last year, data from
Grid India
showed, eating into the share of coal-fuelled
electricity
for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic.
More than 75% of India's power generation was from
coal
in 2023, while gas-fired plants have accounted for only about 2% in recent years, largely because of the high cost of gas relative to coal.
In May, coal's share dipped to 74%, compared with 75.2% during the same month last year, while gas's share nearly doubled to 3.1% from 1.6%.
An emergency clause invoked to force operation of idle gas-fired power plants to avoid power cuts during the 43-day federal elections that ended last week also drove gas usage, industry officials said, as power outages have historically been a key electoral issue.
Live Events
""The current growth of Indian
power demand
suggests the rising need for greater availability (of natural gas) and
flexibility
will remain a fixture in coming years,"" said Joachim Moxon, LNG analyst at
ICIS
.
LNG IMPORTS
TO RISE
India's gas-fired power output is expected to grow by 10.5% in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, following 35% growth the prior year.
To meet that demand, LNG imports by the price-sensitive buyer swelled in May to the highest levels since October 2020, data from analytics firms
LSEG
and
Kpler
showed, despite global prices up five-fold from the pandemic-hit lows of 2020.
Demand
for LNG in India, the world's fourth-largest importer of the fuel, is set to increase by 19% in 2024, with imports forecast to reach more than 28 million metric tons in 2025, up from 22.1 million tons in 2023, according to ICIS.
""India's LNG imports will continue to be driven higher by the power sector in at least the next two years,"" said Victor Vanya, director at Indian power analytics firm
EMA Solutions
.
Industry officials and analysts have argued allocating more domestically produced gas could allow gas-fired generation to better compete with coal, but most local gas has gone to other sectors in recent years.
""The insufficient local gas output is increasingly being used to supply the city gas network and fertiliser companies, and power generators will have to import,"" said a senior executive at a large Indian gas exchange who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.
Despite being cheaper, solar and wind are harder to control and forecast than gas, while coal and nuclear power cannot be ramped up or down as quickly in response to sudden demand spurts or dips.
Gas's flexibility and a 2022 federal regulation that provided a policy framework for operating more expensive gas-fired power plants have helped boost the fuel's use, industry officials and experts said.
""Until we have optimal, large-scale battery storage solutions in India, peaking requirements such as ramping up and ramping down quickly will be met by
thermal sources
including natural gas,"" said Sadek Wahba, managing partner at Miami-based private equity firm I Squared Capital, which has invested billions of dollars in natural gas and
renewables
in India.

A total of 10.55 lac RECs (equivalent to 1,055 MU) were traded in the trading sessions held on May 8 and May 29 at a clearing price of Rs 185/REC and Rs 165/REC, respectively.
At Rs 165 per certificate, the REC market recorded an all-time low price in the trading session held on May 29, 2024.
Live Events
These prices provide an opportunity for obligated entities (
Discoms
and captive
power
producers) to meet their renewable purchase obligations and for voluntary customers to meet their sustainability aspirations.
Proactive measures taken by the government and the regulators, including the sale of surplus un-requisitioned power on power exchanges, increased fuel supply and ensuring higher availability of generating units led to an increased sell liquidity on the exchanges, which kept the prices under control on the trading platforms, it explained.
Therefore, it stated that despite the increase in electricity consumption, the market clearing price in the Day Ahead Market during May 2024 was Rs 5.3/unit, lower by more than 20 per cent compared to prices discovered under bilateral contracts.
Notably, it stated that on May 30, 2024, the country witnessed an all-time high peak demand of 250 GW along with the highest ever single-day
energy consumption
of 5,466 MU.

They also said that the power demand peaked at 243 GW in September last year due to unseasonal rains from March 2023 onwards.
It was only due to
high humidity levels
in September that the peak power demand touched a record level of 243 GW, they added.
In March this year, the
India Meteorological Department
(IMD) projected that
India
is likely to experience a warmer summer and more heatwave days this year, with
El Nino conditions
predicted to continue at least until May.
However, experts say that power demand may peak to touch new highs during the remainder of the summer season this year.
According to the IMD, the
Monsoon
has already hit the Kerala coast on May 30 and covered the entire Northeast, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnakata, Goa and Telangana.
Experts said that power demand would peak again in the coming months due to sultry weather conditions after the Monsoon covers the entire season with excessive use of cooling appliances, especially air conditioners.

has come a long way since that infamous 2012
power outage
-- the world's biggest ever on record -- that had drowned large swathes of the country for significant period. It is now taking unprecedented levels of power demands in its stride with unimaginable ease, ToI reported on June 3.
On May 30, India's
power demand
surged to an unprecedented 250 gigawatts (GW), surpassing the projected 235 GW for the month. Despite this spike, the national
transmission network
remained stable with no unscheduled outages reported. Dispatchers at the
national control centre
, responsible for managing
electricity
flow, are now preparing for an anticipated peak demand of 258 GW in the upcoming months.
This is hugely different from the situation witnessed in July 30 and 31, 2012, when India experienced the world's largest
blackout
, ToI's report (by Sanjay Dutta) says. During that crisis, the northern and eastern grids collapsed due to overload, leaving 620 million people, or 9% of the global population at the time, without power for more than 13 hours.
Since then, significant improvements have transformed India’s transmission network into the world's largest
unified grid
. This upgraded system enables Grid-India to maintain equilibrium by redistributing load. Whether it involves thermal, nuclear, hydro, solar, or wind power, electricity can be efficiently transferred from one region to another—and even across borders—ensuring stable distribution for utilities.
TNN
ToI reported quoting Grid-India chairman S R Narasimhan, ""Things don’t get over for us with the day. We have to analyse data on trippings, frequency, voltage, loading of lines or transformers to see they are within limits. We go into any violation to ensure a repeat. We have to be on our toes.""

An ‘energy management system’ continuously monitors the grid around the clock, with data collected at two-minute intervals and every 40 milliseconds using ‘synchrophasors’. Advanced planning involves computer simulations to model worst-case demand-supply scenarios and to verify inter-region transfer limits. This information is utilized for managing the market.
According to Narasimhan, ""With wind and solar, we have a situation where north would (typically) export (power) during daytime when there is high solar and so on. We put out those figures 11 months in advance for trades to happen as long as grid conduct rules and transfer limits are not breached.""
Additionally, week-ahead forecasts are generated based on weather predictions to estimate solar and wind power availability and determine hydro generation patterns, as coal- and gas-based plants must supply the remaining demand.
Meeting peak daytime demand is manageable due to the ample supply of solar power, allowing coal-fired plants to reduce output during the day and increase it at night. Hydro power is typically scheduled during peak hours when prices are high, and gas-fired power is used only if there is still a shortfall.
Narasimhan noted that overdrawal, a major factor in the 2012 grid failure, along with conflicts between national and state load dispatchers, have ""decreased significantly.""
""Overdrawals for short periods (30 minutes to an hour) happen at times in case of sudden loss of resource in a state. But by and large they mobilise alternative resources within this time as they have realised violation of grid code is not good for anyone,"" Narasimhan explained.

Delhi's discoms relying on advanced-technology transformers to ensure uninterrupted power supply,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhis-discoms-relying-on-advanced-technology-transformers-to-ensure-uninterrupted-power-supply/articleshow/110590417.cms,31-05-2024,"The power discoms operating in Delhi are relying on their
advanced-technology transformers
to ensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity, with the
peak demand
ranging around 8,000 MW amid a scorching heatwave in the city. The transformers used by the BSES are designed to operate at 40 degrees above the ambient (area) temperature, said a spokesperson of the company.
""This basically means that the transformers can operate at up to 40 degrees more than the prevalent area temperature. For example, if the area temperature is 48 degrees Celsius, these can operate till 88 degrees Celsius without any external aid,"" he said.
The
BSES discoms
(distribution companies) --
BSES Rajdhani Power Limited
(BRPL) and
BSES Yamuna Power Limited
(BYPL) -- supply electricity to most parts of the city except North Delhi.
""Due to the modern design and technology, there is no need for any external aid like a fan to cool the transformer,"" the BSES spokesperson said.
Transformers getting overheated and burnt due to extreme temperatures leads to
power outages
for hours.

In some extreme cases, if the transformer temperature goes beyond 88 degrees Celsius, an external cooling fan is used to bring the temperature within the permissible limits, the BSES spokesperson said.
The
Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited
(TPDDL) discom that supplies electricity to North Delhi operates 88 grid substations at the 66-KV and 33-KV level with 222 transformers, all remotely monitored and controlled through a central Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, said a spokesperson of the company.
""With the mercury soaring to extremes this summer, maintaining the optimal performance of our power transformers is crucial to ensure their effective functioning,"" she said.
Delhi recorded its highest-ever
peak power demand
of 8,302 megawatt on Wednesday as the city recorded a maximum temperature of 46.8 degrees, the highest in 79 years.
On Thursday, the maximum temperature was 45.6 degrees Celsius and the peak power demand was 8,091 MW at 3:28 pm. The weather department has forecast a maximum temperature of 44 degrees Celsius for Friday.
The TPDDL transformers are meticulously designed for diverse seasons and Delhi's environmental conditions, the spokesperson said.
The transformers are equipped with an ""Oil Natural Air Natural"" (ONAN), ""Oil Natural Air Forced"" (ONAF) cooling system that keeps their temperatures within the permissible limits during summer, she said.
An automatic cooling system activates or deactivates the cooling fans or oil pumps based on the transformers' oil temperature and winding temperature.
Remote monitoring through the
SCADA system
allows keeping a close watch on the oil and winding temperature indicators, she added.
Additionally, there is an arrangement of industrial blowers, strategic load shifting and sharing between transformers to avoid overheating issues.
Online monitoring, including thermos-scanning and ultrasonic testing, also ensures that the transformers are in peak condition even during the most demanding times, the TPDDL spokesperson said.

India's power sector anticipates healthy growth in FY2025; demand seen remaining strong at around 6%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-sector-anticipates-healthy-growth-in-fy2025-demand-seen-remaining-strong-at-around-6/articleshow/110588545.cms,31-05-2024,"India's
power sector
is poised for robust
growth
in the fiscal year 2025, with expectations of a healthy
demand
surge at approximately 6.0 per cent, albeit moderating from the previous fiscal year.
The healthy demand growth continued in the first two months of FY25 at over 10 per cent supported by a favourable base. The report stands validated by the record maximum
power
demand of 250 GW on May 30, as announced by the
Ministry of Power
.
The report says, FY24 witnessed a significant upturn in
electricity
demand, marked by a 7.6 per cent increase on a year-on-year basis, fuelled by a resilient economic activity and weather-related loads.
The nationwide average
thermal plant
load factor (PLF) increased to 69.1 per cent in FY2024, up from 64.2 per cent in FY2023
The total power generation capacity addition improved to 25.4 GW in FY24, up from 16.9 GW in FY23, driven by enhancements in the
renewable energy
and thermal segments, as well as the commissioning of 1.4 GW of nuclear power capacity.
Live Events
According to the
government
, the thermal generation segment played a pivotal role in meeting the escalating demand, reaching an all-time high of 176 GW during non-solar hours.
The growth trajectory extends to the renewable energy (RE) sector, which is anticipated to witness an increase in
installed capacity
, contributing to the overall power generation landscape.
Gross addition in installed power capacity is expected to soar to over 30 GW in FY25, with the RE segment leading the charge, following a commendable performance of 25 GW in FY24.
Tariff hikes
approved for FY25 had been relatively modest, with an average increase of 2.5 per cent, lower than the 3.9 per cent approved for FY24. This subdued increase comes at a time when the subsidy dependence of distribution companies (
Discoms
) on state governments is projected to rise significantly.
It is estimated that this subsidy dependence will reach Rs 1.9 trillion in FY25, up from Rs 1.7 trillion in FY23. This increase is attributed to the rising cost of supply and the introduction of additional subsidy schemes in certain states.
Despite the positive outlook, challenges persist, notably in the distribution segment. Progress in the issuance of tariff orders for state distribution utilities (Discoms) remains sluggish, with only 11 out of 28 states having issued orders as of May 2024.
This delay is partly attributed to ongoing elections. Furthermore, average tariff hikes approved for
FY2025
have been relatively muted, standing at 2.5 per cent, lower than the preceding fiscal year.
The coal import dynamics have also witnessed a shift, with imports by power utilities surging by 18.1 per cent YoY in FY24.
This reversal in trend was influenced by governmental directives to blend imported coal for domestic coal-based projects, reflecting evolving policy interventions aimed at optimizing resource utilization.
The sustainability of these achievements hinges on addressing structural inefficiencies, particularly in high-loss states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh, where aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) loss levels exceed 20 per cent.
Overall, the power sector's ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities underscores the coordinated efforts of stakeholders, including government agencies, power generation companies, and grid operators.
Their steadfast commitment to enhancing generation capacity and implementing policy reforms remains pivotal in meeting the nation's energy demands.
The Ministry of Power reiterated the significance of renewable energy sources, especially solar and wind, in augmenting the power supply during peak hours, highlighting the sector's transition towards a sustainable and diversified energy ecosystem.

India's peak power demand hits a record 250 GW,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-peak-power-demand-hits-a-record-250-gw/articleshow/110573089.cms,31-05-2024,"New Delhi:
India
met a
record
maximum
power demand
of 250
GW
on May 30, led by a combined impact of weather-related loads and growing industrial and residential power consumption in these areas, the
power ministry
said on Thursday.
The non-solar hours demand was at an all time high of 234.3 GW the day before, the government said.
The northern region achieved a record 'demand met', reaching an all-time high of 86.7 GW, while the western region touched 74.8 GW.
Thermal generation
achieves a
peak
of 176 GW, especially during non-solar hours.
A key contributor for the generation was implementation of section 11 of the
Electricity Act
, which facilitated the maximization of generation from imported coal based plants and gas based plants, the
ministry
said.

The RP, Bhuvan Madan backed by
EY India
, had pleaded against a stay of CIRP on grounds that even the Supreme Court has not granted a stay on the process following an appeal by the promoter.
The company has three 150 MW units located in Haldia, Kolkata, but only two are operational, and one is under construction. In 2017, it signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with the West Bengal government and has a coal procurement agreement with Coal India.
BHEL
designed and built the plant.
The RP has admitted verified claims of ₹5,291 crore.
REC
,
Power Finance Corporation
and RBL Bank are among the lenders to the thermal power company. A claim of ₹566 crore from the promoter Power Trust was not admitted, show disclosures made by the RP.
In 2013, REC and PFC jointly provided a ₹1,859 crore loan to Hiranmaye Energy to build a power plant, but the company failed to pay the outstanding amounts under the original terms on March 31, 2018, according to an admission order passed by the NCLT.
According to a July 28, 2023, rating report by Care Ratings, India Power Corporation invested ₹490.5 crore in Hiranmaye Energy in the form of fully compulsorily convertible debentures (FCCD) at a face value of ₹10 each. These FCCDs were transferred to Power Trust at book value in March 2017. Thereafter, the company ceased to be a subsidiary of IPCL on March 31, 2017, and became an associate, the report said.
In 2017-18, IPCL transferred the remaining investment in compulsorily convertible preference shares amounting to ₹306.8 crore to Power Trust.
According to the Care Ratings report, in 2010, the Kanoria family of Kolkata acquired DPSC through its investment company, India Power Corporation (erstwhile IPCL), from Andrew Yule & Co Ltd. In 2013, erstwhile IPCL merged with DPSC, and consequently, DPSC's name was changed to IPCL.

NTPC proposes pooling entire capacity for supply to power distribution companies,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ntpc-proposes-pooling-entire-capacity-for-supply-to-power-distribution-companies/articleshow/110444870.cms,27-05-2024,"State-owned
NTPC
Ltd has written to the
power ministry
proposing
pooling
of its ""entire
capacity
"" for sale of power to distribution companies, according to people aware of the development.
If approved, the proposed move could ease
supply
and operations as the company would be able to sell power to a discom from any station and not restrict it to stage-wise units, people familiar with the matter said.
The power purchase
agreements
(PPAs) with some
discoms
are signed in stages of commissioning and each stage is a separate entity for tariff and scheduling purposes.
As per the company the current arrangement limits operational flexibility and often impacts power availability for discoms in case of forced outages and breakdowns of a station.
""Discoms/states will get a steady supply of power even in the case of shutdown of units......,"" the company said in a letter to the ministry, people familiar with the matter said.

It also becomes difficult to operate when a discom schedules a power station below the technical minimum during off-peak hours. ""The request is for all
stations
to be pooled. It is a proposal the
Central Electricity Authority
is examining,"" one of the persons said. An email sent to
NTPC
did not elicit any response till the time of filing this report.
In a central generation company like NTPC, power is allocated to distribution companies by the government after which a power purchase agreement is signed between them. The Central
Electricity
Authority, the planning and advisory body under the power ministry, has been asked to assess the impact of the move that will bring on the electricity tariff for distribution companies.
If approved, the stations could have a somewhat average capacity charge because states that are paying a lower rate could pay slightly more, while those paying higher may benefit, according to two people. The
ministry of power
had last July rolled out a programme allowing pooling of
tariffs
of thermal power plants whose power purchase agreements had expired.
Currently, the sale of power for such stations is stage-specific because of which declaring capacity availability and scheduling of power daily is done stage-wise. For instance, even though Vindhyachal power plant is a single generating station, it has five stages and the buyers of each are different. According to another source, if the supply of power to distribution companies is made company specific, it could ensure more reliability in power supply to distribution companies. A steady supply, even in case of shutdown of units due to planned and forced outages, could be ensured as a reduction in capacity would be spread over a larger base, the person said.

""Today at 3:42 pm, the peak power demand in Delhi reached 8000 MW. The Delhi government has met this peak demand without imposing a power cut. This is a great achievement for the people of Delhi, because till 2014, there used to be long power cuts even at the peak demand of 5925 MW in summers.
""On the other hand, there are
BJP-ruled states
like UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where there have been power cuts of 10-12 hours in the last 2-3 days. This is the reason why the BJP wants to destroy the
Aam Aadmi Party
. Because our work shows the truth of their failure to the entire country,"" he wrote in Hindi.

The extreme heatwave conditions in the national capital have pushed Delhi's power demand.
This is the fifth day in a row Delhi's peak power demand has crossed the 7,000 MW and broken the previous all-time May high of 7,070 MW, recorded on May 19, 2022.
Discom officials said that
BSES Rajdhani Power Limited
(BRPL),
BSES Yamuna Power Limited
(BYPL) were succepssfully able to meet the peak power demand in their respective areas.
As per the
State Load Dispatch Centre
(
SLDC
), during April 2024, the peak power demand was higher on 83 per cent of the corresponding days compared to April 2023, with a difference of up to 32 per cent, highlighting the impact that weather can have on a city's power consumption patterns.
Power demand can be attributed to weather conditions that led residents to use more air conditioners/ coolers, leading to an increase in
electricity consumption
.
Air conditioning
can contribute to 30-50 per cent of a household's or company's yearly energy expense, according to SLDC.
Delhi's peak power demand during the summers of 2024 may reach up to 8,200 MW, the SLDC data said.
Peak power demand in BRPL's area of South and West Delhi is also expected to reach around 3,680 MW during this year's summer.
On the other hand, in BYPL's area of East and Central Delhi, the peak power demand, is expected to touch around 1,860 MW this year.

Bureau of Energy Efficiency plans norms to make more products energy efficient,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bureau-of-energy-efficiency-plans-norms-to-make-more-products-energy-efficient/articleshow/110312234.cms,22-05-2024,"NEW DELHI: The
Bureau of Energy Efficiency
(BEE) plans to introduce
energy efficiency
norms for a range of additional products such as
electric irons
,
room heaters
,
LED battens
and evaporator coolers, and launch them under the voluntary labelling scheme so that
manufacturers
can mention the energy-saving potential of the appliance for consumers to make an informed buying decision, said director general
Abhay Bakre
.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
The
power ministry
body, which works on improving energy efficiency of electronic products, also plans to revise the energy efficiency levels of ten existing
star-rated products
such as refrigerators, ceiling fans, room ACs and distribution transformers this year to push manufacturers to launch more
energy-efficient products
. Over the next three years, it will make
energy labelling
norms compulsory for products such as LPG stoves, microwave ovens and induction hobs, which are voluntary at present, said Bakre.
According to the BEE's impact assessment report, energy efficiency measures helped save consumers Rs 54,323 crore in 2022-23 alone. ""In 2022-23, the energy efficiency initiatives saved 307 billion units of energy for Indian consumers,"" Bakre said.
In line with the bureau's promotion of energy-efficient products, states are recommending electronics manufacturers and distribution companies to promote buyback and replacement schemes for consumers whereby they can upgrade their old products with more energy-efficient ones.
""The buyback and replacement schemes of the older products with newer more energy-efficient appliances will help to reduce consumer's electricity bills,"" said Bakre. ""This will in turn create more demand for domestic manufacturers and bring down prices.""

Bakre said
discoms
in states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi are running schemes for the adoption of energy-efficient products like air conditioners and fans. The BEE has waived the labelling fee for manufacturers for some high-star-rated appliances to incentivise and encourage the production of more energy-efficient products. Appliances are rated in an energy efficiency rating of one to five stars, whereby a five-star product is the most energy efficient and a one-star the least.
Industry executives said if additional buyback offers for consumers or incentive schemes through discoms are introduced, it will boost demand for three-star to five-star rated electronic products. These products have a premium pricing depending on their star ratings as manufacturers say the input cost is higher to make them more energy efficient.
""We are also moving out from energy efficient home appliances to energy efficiency standards for industrial equipment,"" Bakre said.
The BEE plans to launch energy labelling for single-phase induction motors, municipal pumps, walk-in cold rooms and variable refrigerant flow (VRFs), initially on a voluntary basis for manufacturers.
The body is running a pilot to evaluate the response to QR codes on refrigerators which will give detailed information to consumers on the energy efficiency of the product.

Peak power demand hit 229.6 GW on Saturday,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/peak-power-demand-hit-229-6-gw-on-saturday/articleshow/110281406.cms,21-05-2024,"New Delhi:
As summer heat scorched western and northern regions of India, peak
power demand
reached 229.6 GW in daytime on May 18, typically unheard of on a weekend. Prior to this, the season's high was recorded on May 6 at 233 GW.
After May 6, the peak demand varied between 207 GW and 226 GW. The peak so far in May has, however, been within the government's estimate for the month at 235 GW during the day when
solar energy
is available.
Government data
showed the peak demand was met with no shortfall. Last year, peak demand in May was 221 GW, as temperatures were lower than expected and with sparce
heatwave conditions
. However, the highest peak demand on record was also reported last year at 243 GW in September amid deficit
monsoon rainfall
.
According to the
India Meteorological Department
, heatwave to severe heatwave conditions were observed in parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh-Delhi, and in isolated pockets of Madhya Pradesh on May 18. In several of these regions, the maximum temperatures hovered around 43-46 degree Celsius, or 2-4 degrees above normal. ""The issue is the heatwave is not a one off. It has been prevailing for days which is leading to
high electricity
demand for cooling,"" a government official said.

Heatwave conditions are expected to continue in several parts of the country for the next few days.
The
power ministry
has projected the
peak power
demand in May at 235 GW during the daytime and 225 GW during evening hours. For June, the demand is projected at 240 GW in solar hours and 235 GW in non-solar hours. The government expects the demand to be adequately met during the months, the ministry said in a statement earlier this month.
It reiterated that the pre-emptive steps taken for the
summer months
, the current power generation trend and the anticipated above-normal monsoon in the following months as predicted by the
IMD
, will help ""adequately"" meet the demand.

's peak
power demand
is hovering near the projected 235 GW level in May, following excessive use of
cooling appliances
like air conditioners and desert coolers amid severe heat waves in the country. According to the power ministry data, the
peak
power demand met or the highest supply in the day has already reached 233 GW on May 6 compared to 221.42 GW recorded a year ago.
Earlier in the month, the power ministry estimated that the power demand would peak at 235 GW during the daytime, and 225 GW during evening hours in May; and 240 GW during daytime and 235 GW during evening hours in June 2024.
Last week, the peak power supply touched 229.57 GW on May 18, while it was around 226 GW on May 15, 16 and 17.
The peak supply was 229.77 GW on May 4, and interestingly the highest supply in a day crossed the 221.42 GW, recorded in May last year, on May 2 this year.
The industry experts opined that power demand would increase further due to the increase in the intensity of heat in May, as the
Southwest Monsoon
, which brings relief from the scorching heat in summer, is likely to hit the Kerala coast on June 1 every year.
Live Events
Moreover, the Southwest Monsoon covers almost the entire country and reaches Delhi by the end of June, experts said, adding that therefore, power demand would remain steady and high next month also.
Earlier in March this year, the
India Meteorological Department
(IMD) had projected that India is likely to experience a warmer summer and more heatwave days this year, with
El Nino
conditions predicted to continue at least until May.
From March to May, the above-normal number of heatwave days is likely over most parts of the country, except northeast India, the western Himalayan region, the southwest peninsula and the west coast, it stated.
According to the IMD report on Monday, the maximum temperatures were in the range of 43 to 47 degrees Celsius in most places in Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan and in many parts of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, West Madhya Pradesh; in some parts of East Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.
The
temperature
varied in the range of 40 to 42 degrees Celsius in many parts of Vidharbha, in isolated pockets of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Maharashtra and plans of Uttrakhand and Himachal Pradesh.
The IMD, in its bulletin, said that
heat wave
to severe heat wave conditions is very likely in many/most pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West Rajasthan; in some parts of West Uttar Pradesh, East Rajasthan and Northwest Madhya Pradesh during May 20 to 24.

The weather has a profound impact on power demand. This was visible even during April when compared to the same period in 2023, they said.
In April, Delhi's peak power demand ranged between 3,809 MW and 5,447 MW. In April 2023, the peak power demand ranged between 3,388 MW and 5,422 MW, they added.
""The demand can be attributed to weather conditions that lead residents to use more
air conditioning
and cooling equipment, causing an increase in
electricity consumption
. Air conditioning can contribute to 30-50 per cent of a domestic or commercial establishment,"" the discom officials said.
A
Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited
spokesperson said, ""Tata Power-DDL successfully met a peak power demand of 2,178 MW -- the highest so far in the current season -- in our area of operations today without any network constraint and power outages.""
Peak power demand in
BSES Rajdhani Power Limited
(BRPL) areas of south and west Delhi, which clocked 3,250 MW and 3,389 MW, respectively, during the summers of 2023 and 2022, is expected to reach around 3,680 MW this year, a BSES spokesperson said.
In east and central Delhi -- areas served by the
BSES Yamuna Power Limited
(BYPL) -- the peak power demand, recorded at 1,670 MW and 1,752 MW during the summers of 2023 and 2022, respectively, is expected to touch around 1,860 MW, he said.
The two discoms are geared to ensure a reliable power supply to meet the demand of consumers, he added.
BRPL and BYPL successfully met a peak power demand of 3,274 MW and 1,664 MW, respectively, in their respective areas on Monday, the spokesperson said.

Notably, several areas in the National Capital witness a surge in temperature amid the
summer
season.
Delhi's Safdarjung area, which recorded 43.4 degrees on May 17, recorded 43.6 degrees on May 18.
The Delhi Ridge area witnessed a surge in temperature from 43.2 degrees on May 17 to 45 degrees today.
As per the release, during April 2024, the peak power demand was higher on 83 per cent of the corresponding days compared to April 2023, with a difference of up to 32 per cent. This disparity highlights the profound impact that weather can have on a city's power consumption patterns.
""According to SLDC data, after clocking a record power demand of 7695 MW in 2022, Delhi's peak power demand during the summers of 2024 may cross the 8000 MW for the first time- reaching upto 8200 MW. Last year, Delhi's peak power demand had clocked 7438 MW,"" the release stated.

In a 51-page order, a two-judge bench comprising NCLAT chairman Ashok Bhushan and Arun Baroka, directed the

""We have noticed that no opportunity was given to the successful resolution applicant (SEML),

The appellate tribunal's order is a relief to SEML, though it still requires NCLT's approval.
""RP Ashish Rathi has already filed an application in the NCLT seeking revival of the plea seeking plan approval. It will most likely be taken up post the summer break (of the NCLT) next month,"" said a person aware of the process. ""It remains to be seen whether the challengers (Torrent Power and Vantage Point) file new objections to this plea,"" he added.

Rathi did not reply to an email seeking comment.
The NCLAT's order was in response to a plea by SEML, challenging NCLT's direction to the CoC in October to reconsider their decision.
At the time, the NCLT had said that the decision of the CoC was based on incomplete financial data, leaving the decision-making process ""perverse and amenable to interference.""
The NCLAT, for its decision, relied on a Supreme Court order in another case that had said a minor infraction of procedure, or any other similar reasons, was not sufficient to term a decision as perverse. ""In event, all relevant materials are available before the CoC, which is deliberated, no perversity can be imputed in the decision,"" the NCLAT said.
Nagpur-based SEML was declared the winning bidder in June last year, over Torrent, Vantage and Jindal Power in a close fight with less than one percentage point difference between the offers of the top four bidders. SKS owes ₹1,890 crore to Bank of Baroda and State Bank of India. The facility is in high demand because it is a rare working power plant available for sale with 25 years of fuel agreement accompanying a railway line.
Jindal also had filed a late application seeking certain reliefs from the NCLAT, but the court refused to grant any relief. The importance of the case can be gauged from the battery of heavyweight lawyers representing different parties in the case: Harish Salve (for SEML), Mukul Rohatgi (CoC), Kapil Sibal (Torrent) and K Venugopal (Jindal Power).

On the other hand, in East and Central Delhi, catered to by BYPL, the peak power demand, which had reached 1,752 MW and 1,670 MW during the summer of 2022 and 2023, is expected to touch around 1,857 MW this year, he added.
The high power demand can be attributed to
weather conditions
that led residents to use more
air conditioning
equipments leading to an increase in
electricity consumption
.
The discom officials said air conditioning can contribute to 30-50 per cent of a domestic or commercial establishment's yearly
energy expense
.
It is worth noting that on each day of May so far, Delhi's peak power demand is more than that of May 2023.
In the first 16 days of May last year, Delhi's peak power demand had clocked 5,781 MW, discom officials said.
The weather department has estimated the maximum temperature to touch 42 degrees on Thursday and up to 45 degrees on Saturday.
The weather's impact on the power demand was clearly visible in Delhi even in April this year in comparison to April of 2023, the discom officials said.
""In April 2024, Delhi's peak power demand ranged between 3,809 MW and 5,447 MW. As opposed to this, Delhi's peak power demand during April 2023 ranged between 3,388 MW and 5,422 MW,"" they said.
The BSES spokesperson said that the two discoms of the company are geared-up to ensure there is enough
power supply
to meet the power demand of around 50 lakh consumers.
These arrangements include long term power purchase agreements and banking arrangements with other states and deployment of latest technologies like
artificial intelligence
and machine learning to predict power demand accurately, he said.
Around 2,100 MW of green power will play an important role in ensuring reliable power supply, he added.
A spokesperson of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) said the discom successfully met the summer peak demand of 1,982 MW, the highest requirement so far in this summer season, ensuring uninterrupted power supply without any network constrain and power outages.
On their part, BRPL and BYPL successfully met the peak power demand of 2,861 MW and 1,488 MW respectively.

Power Finance Corporation
(
PFC
), the country's largest lender to the power sector, said the
Reserve Bank
's recent draft guidelines on infrastructure
project financing
will not impact its
profitability
.
The company said it has sufficient
capital adequacy
to counter the provision if it gets implemented.
""We are examining those guidelines in detail, but what we understand is that these guidelines have been issued for the projects under implementation. I would like to say that in such a case, we are not going to have any impact on the profitability,"" said Parminder Chopra, chairperson and MD of Power Finance Corp.
""We have a very comfortable capital adequacy of about 25% as against
RBI
's minimum requirement of 15% and our tier one capital is also more than 50% as against capital guidelines of RBI. So, we are not expecting any major impact of those guidelines,"" she added.
A recent draft proposal by the central bank said that lenders should set aside a 5% provision of the loan amount that is sanctioned for projects at the construction phase.
Live Events
On Wednesday, the company reported an 18.4% year-on-year jump in
net profit
at ₹4,135 crore for the March quarter.
The company said asset quality during the quarter improved and net non-performing assets (NPAs) came down to 0.85% and gross
NPAs

Thermal PLFs to remain healthy amid power demand-supply mismatch: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/thermal-plfs-to-remain-healthy-amid-power-demand-supply-mismatch-report/articleshow/110148809.cms,15-05-2024,"India Ratings and Research
on Wednesday maintained a neutral outlook for the power sector, noting that thermal PLFs (plant load factor or capacity utilisation) will remain healthy amid demand-supply mismatch in FY25. ""India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has maintained a neutral outlook for the
power sector
for
FY25
, as it believes the overall plant load factor of thermal power plants would continue to improve and reach closer to 70 per cent in FY25,"" an
Ind-Ra
statement said.
This is attributed to continued higher power demand, a ramp-up in domestic coal production, slower capacity additions and continued dependence on coal-based generation till sufficient storage capacity is built up for energy transition towards renewables, it added.
""Ind-Ra continues to see a demand-supply mismatch in the power market, which would lead to a continued uptick in plant load factors of thermal plants and elevated
merchant tariffs
,"" said Bhanu Patni, Associate Director, Corporate Ratings, Ind-Ra.
Patni further stated that while
solar capacity addition
has picked up pace following a reduction in the module prices and renewable capacity addition is likely to remain at over 15GW annually, effective storage options still need to be developed for the renewable capacities to be able to provide round-the-clock power.
The sector has seen an improvement in debt position backed by a reduction in working capital requirements and an improvement in capital structures of large players, Patni added.
Live Events
The agency expects merchant market prices to remain high in FY25 amid continued higher demand and slower thermal capacity addition.
However, Ind-Ra expects the thermal capacity addition to pick up pace over FY25-26 with the likely commissioning of 6-8 GW each year.
The new draft tariff norms released by the
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
for FY25-29 also ensure stability by keeping the regulated returns of existing power plants.
Ind-Ra expects the annual renewable capacity addition to maintain pace and remain at 15-18 GW over FY25-26, owing to a significant reduction in equipment prices, continued policy support, availability of liquidity and investment plans of some of the large corporate players in the renewable sector for growth.
However, it stated that the execution timelines of renewable capacity addition would continue to hinge on the regulatory stance towards import duties on cells and modules, support towards domestic cells and modules manufacturing and indigenisation push towards domestic equipment sourcing.

Coal's share in India's power generation capacity drops below 50% for 1st time since 1960s,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/coals-share-in-indias-power-generation-capacity-drops-below-50-for-1st-time-since-1960s/articleshow/110136283.cms,15-05-2024,"The share of
coal
in India's total
power generation capacity
dipped below 50 percent in the first quarter of 2024, the first time since the 1960s. The latest POWERup quarterly report from the
Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis
(
IEEFA
) showed that
renewable energy
accounted for 71.5 percent of the record 13,669 megawatts (MW) power generation capacity added by
India
in the first quarter (January-March) of this year.
Coal's share, including lignite, in India's total power generation capacity dropped below 50 percent for the first time since the 1960s.
The report noted that the renewable energy trend is well ahead of India's target of achieving 50 percent cumulative power generation capacity from non-fossil fuel-based sources by 2030.
The decline in coal's share of power generation capacity mirrors a
global trend
, with demand for coal in
G7 countries
hitting record lows in 2023, levels not seen since 1900.
To accelerate the transition, G7 countries pledged last month to phase out all unabated coal power generation by 2035, building on their commitment to halt all construction of new coal-fired power plants.
Live Events
The term ""unabated"" generally refers to the continued use of coal, oil, and gas without efforts to curtail emissions.
At the
United Nations
'
COP28 climate change conference
in December last year, world leaders reached a historic agreement to transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels and triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030.
According to the report, a record 69 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy tenders were issued in India in the fiscal year (FY) 2023-24, surpassing the central government's target of 50 GW per year.
""After a downturn from 2019 to 2022 due to supply-chain issues and global price spikes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the market has rebounded and gone from strength to strength,"" Vibhuti Garg, Director - South Asia, IEEFA, said.
India has risen to third place in the world's
solar power
generation rankings, trailing only China and the US, according to
Ember
's fifth annual Global
Electricity
Review of 80 countries.
Ranked ninth in 2015, India has now overtaken Japan, which, along with fellow G7 member Germany, has a persistently high demand for coal.
Solar power generated a record 5.5 percent of global electricity in 2023, with India generating 5.8 percent of its electricity from solar last year.
Solar remained the world's fastest-growing electricity source for the 19th consecutive year in 2023, adding more than twice as much new electricity worldwide as coal.
India witnessed the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 (+18 terawatt hour or TWh), behind China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh), and Brazil (+22 TWh). Together, the top four solar growth countries accounted for 75 percent of growth in 2023.
Solar's contribution to electricity generation in India surged from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 5.8 percent in 2023.
According to the
International Energy Agency
's (IEA) ""Net Zero Emissions"" scenario, solar would make up 22 percent of global electricity generation by 2030.
Given that electricity generation accounts for nearly half of India's annual carbon dioxide emissions (1.18 gigatonnes in 2023), accelerating the transition to cleaner generation sources is crucial for the country to meet both its developmental and climate goals.
The IEA says tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency are essential to limit the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a political target set in 2015 to prevent further worsening of climate impacts.
India is among the few countries aiming to triple renewable capacity by 2030.

Tata Power to target 20% share in PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana: CEO,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/tata-power-to-target-20-share-in-pm-surya-ghar-muft-bijli-yojana-ceo/articleshow/110060716.cms,12-05-2024,"Tata Power
is planning to spend ₹20,000 crore on
capital expenditure
this fiscal. Half of the spending will go towards
renewable energy
and the rest on
distribution
,
transmission
, and coal-based plants.
Praveer Sinha
,
CEO
, tells Kalpana Pathak that Tata Power, a leader in
solar rooftop
category, will target 20% of the 25-30 giga watts capacity planned under
PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana
. He said the company has no plan currently to add fresh
thermal power capacity
but will consider it based on demand. Edited excerpts:
You are the leader in the solar rooftop category. How do you plan to expand in the segment?
Yes, we are the leader in rooftop solar with a 2 GW installed capacity. And we think with the new scheme of PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, which aims to solarise 10 million households, more people will be incentivised to set up rooftop solar. The expectation is that in the next 4-5 years, about 25-30 GW of capacity will be added. We are looking to cover about 20% of this but it will be over five years. It will be flat in the initial years but possibly from the second or third year, we will see much more capacity getting added. Our 4 GW module plant is already operational and is producing modules. The 4 GW cell plant will also be completed and start producing next month. This will ensure that we have a consistent supply.
Would Tata Power consider adding thermal power capacity?
We had taken a stand that we are not adding any thermal capacity. However, we will be taking care of thermal assets for group companies like
Tata Steel
and
Tata Chemicals
. Outside, we have not looked, but we will examine if there is demand in the country. We have not taken a position on thermal power. So, once we know what sort of projects are there, what the opportunity is, and what sort of long-term power purchase agreements are there, we can examine it and decide.
Are you looking at backward integration for your cells and module plant?

Right now, we are not doing backward integration. We will continue to be in cell and module because there's a huge capacity that has come in some of the other geographies and we are sourcing them at a very efficient price. Unlike cells and modules which have basic customs duty, there is no customs duty in wafers. So, it is wait-and-watch today because in any case, today, everyone imports that. And we'll have to wait and see if someone is manufacturing in large quantities and if we can tie up with them. Or does it still make sense in terms of cost competitiveness to import it.
How do you see the discoms situation panning out?
We expect that once the new government comes in, there will be huge reforms in the power distribution sector. And one way is what Odisha has done through a public-private partnership or what Delhi has done. The other is, of course, multiple suppliers of electricity where they need to amend the Electricity Act. So, there are different models, and I think there will not be one single solution that will be available for everyone. Different states can offer different solutions, and it depends on what sort of solution is acceptable to them. It's a big opportunity and will be a big reform that will happen in the power sector in the coming year.
The renewable industry is grappling with a
manpower shortage
. How is your company meeting its needs?
We are uniquely positioned that we have very good in-house trained manpower, and we keep on upskilling their knowledge based on new technologies. We continuously train people in various aspects, whether it is behavioural, managerial, or technical. And we develop a great bench strength of people who continuously work for us, and they don't leave us and go, unlike many other companies who have not grown their own timber. We grow our own timber.

is projecting its biggest
power shortfall
in 14 years in
June
after a slump in
hydropower generation
, its
government
told
Reuters
, and is racing to avoid outages by deferring planned plant maintenance and re-opening idled units.
The deficit also follows delays, a government source said, in the commissioning of 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of new
coal-fired plants
which had been targeted to be operational before March.
A peak shortage of 14 GW is forecast in June during nighttime hours, when solar capacity is offline, the
Central Electricity Authority
, the country's planning body for the power sector, told Reuters in a statement.
""The planning process relies on worst-case scenarios,"" it said.
The gap is the widest since 2009-10, according to publicly available government data. India's hydroelectricity output fell at the steepest pace in four decades in the year ended March 31, while
renewable energy
generation was flat.

Power Minister R K Singh
held an emergency meeting last week to take stock of the situation, and decided to defer shutting down power plants for planned maintenance during June and revive 5 GW of idled coal plant capacity, two separate government sources present in the meeting said.
""All efforts have been made to maximise generation, and with the measures in place it is expected that the power demand would be adequately met during the day and the non-solar hours in the coming months including June 2024,"" the statement said.
Grid administrator
Grid-India projects maximum
night-time demand
of 235 GW in June, the statement said. On the supply side, nearly 187 GW of
thermal capacity
is available, and about 34 GW from renewable sources, according to government sources.
The figures on power demand and capacity projections have not been previously reported.
The power ministry last month invoked emergency rights for the first time to direct gas-based and imported coal-based power plants to operate at full capacity.
India has long defended use of coal, but
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration
had slowed capacity growth based on the heavily polluting fuel to focus on the green energy transition, with an eye to meeting 2070
net zero emission goals
.
Plans to set up new coal power plants in the country, which is under pressure from rich economies to stop coal use, gathered momentum last year, but they will take a minimum of four years to start generation.
Existing coal-fired power plants and solar plants will help the nation meet its
electricity demand
during daytime hours, one of the government sources said.

NTPC achieves 20 pc torrefied biomass co-firing at Tanda power plant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ntpc-achieves-20-pc-torrefied-biomass-co-firing-at-tanda-power-plant/articleshow/109980968.cms,09-05-2024,"State-owned power giant
NTPC
on Thursday said it has achieved 20 per cent
torrefied biomass
co-firing at Tanda
thermal plant
in
Uttar Pradesh
. The
NTPC
has established
co-firing
of 7-10 per cent non-torrefied biomass with
coal
at NTPC Dadri, a company statement said.
However, it stated that to achieve higher percentages of biomass co-firing without major modifications, the possibility of using torrefied biomass was explored by
Energy Transition and Policy Research Division of NTPC Engineering
.
According to the statement, the NTPC has achieved a new milestone by successfully demonstrating co-firing of 20 per cent torrefied biomass at its Unit-4 at
Tanda
(thermal plant) in Uttar Pradesh.
The initiative, it said, was a first of its kind in the Indian power sector, showcasing NTPC's commitment to
decarbonising
existing coal-fired fleets and advancing towards
net-zero emission targets
.
Torrefied biomass, produced by heating biomass in the absence of oxygen, exhibits characteristics akin to coal, making it suitable for higher co-firing percentages without significant system modifications.

The
Gross Calorific Value
(GCV) and cost of torrefied biomass pellets are currently equivalent to that of imported coal.
The NTPC's endeavour towards
decarbonisation
includes exploring biomass co-firing in both existing and new coal power plants, the company said.
Each per cent of biomass co-firing has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by approximately the same percentage. Additionally, biomass co-firing also mitigates air pollution caused by direct burning of stubble in the fields by the farmers, it said.

power transmission
and distribution business has bagged multiple orders in the country and overseas. The business has bagged orders to set up two floating
solar plants
in India.
Floating solar projects
involve mounting solar modules on structures that float in a water body, typically a reservoir/lake/abandoned quarry.
Compared to ground-mounted solar plants, floating solar plants do not require land acquisition and typically involve less civil work.
There are other site-specific merits too, besides reduction of water evaporation.
The power transmission and distribution (PT&D) vertical has also received orders to set up
transmission lines
and a
gas insulated substation
to integrate solar energy zones in Rajasthan and Karnataka.
Live Events
These crucial links will enable the evacuation of
renewable energy
to load centres in various parts of the country.
The company has also another order to build a gas insulated substation overseas.
""The
Sultanate of Oman

KSK Mahanadi to NCLT: Change of circumstances calls for fresh bidding,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ksk-mahanadi-to-nclt-change-of-circumstances-calls-for-fresh-bidding/articleshow/109894941.cms,07-05-2024,"KSK Mahanadi Power Company
through its Resolution Professional's (
RP
) counsel informed
NCLT
, Hyderabad, on Monday, that a change of circumstances warrants a fresh invitation of bids under the corporate insolvency resolution process (
CIRP
) for KSK Mahanadi Power, which was admitted into insolvency in October 2019.
One of the prospective resolution applicants (PRAs) of KSK Mahanadi,
Megha Engineering
& Infrastructures Limited had filed a plea before NCLT questioning the intention of RP to invite fresh bids when 12
PRAs
have already been shortlisted under the first round of bidding.
The RP argued that since KSK Mahanadi would now be undergoing CIRP as a separate entity, the changed circumstance requires a fresh round of bidding. The RP also said that the committee of creditors (
CoC
) and eight out of Twelve PRAs have approved
fresh bidding
.
Last month, the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT) lifted a stay on the CIRP of KSK Mahanadi as the CoC had voted in favour of KSK Mahanadi's bidding on a standalone basis rather than combining it with other two entities of KSK Mahanadi also undergoing CIRP.
The two entities were KSK Mahanadi Water and Raigarh Champa Rail. But Megha Engineering's counsel contended that the RP has failed to provide any reason for inviting fresh bidding, and the tribunal has granted no specific permission to go for another round of bidding.

Norms eased to draw in more suppliers for power equipment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/norms-eased-to-draw-in-more-suppliers-for-power-equipment/articleshow/109894871.cms,07-05-2024,"India's apex planning and advisory body for the power sector has eased a key condition for
power equipment supplies
for
public sector projects
, a move that is expected to let utilities to issue tenders allowing larger
private vendor participation
, people familiar with the development said.
This change was advised after some recent tenders from companies such as
NTPC
and
Damodar Valley Corporation
to build
thermal projects
under engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) contracts received muted response. Some of these projects saw single bids.
The
Central Electricity Authority
(
CEA
) has relaxed the pre-qualification requirements, allowing companies with experience in erection of 'sub-critical' units to participate in 'supercritical' projects to encourage competition. Public sector undertaking
Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd
and Larsen & Toubro are said to have been among the few qualified under the earlier regime. It is now expected that
Thermax
,
GE Power
as well as some other companies will also qualify for the tenders under the relaxed qualifications. ""A decision to make this change was made in April,"" a senior official aware of the move told ET.
The previous condition of experience of establishing supercritical units was limiting vendors from participation, according to two officials. The tender for NTPC's 1,600 MW
Singrauli-III thermal power station
saw just one bid and the quoted price was ""high"", said another official. There was also only one bidder for Damodar Valley Corporation's Raghunathpur Phase-II project and the company is likely to go for a rebid. Retendering for the Damodar Valley project is expected to be made under the amended condition. Power generators can decide on the mode of tendering - split, single EPC or package wise.
Live Events
Utilities may explore addition of consortium routes with limited joint and several responsibilities for the tenders, the person said.
The power ministry had held meetings with stakeholders to discuss factors leading to lukewarm response by vendors, a person familiar with the matter said.

"Pre-emptive steps, better planning help meet peak power demand in April",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/pre-emptive-steps-better-planning-help-meet-peak-power-demand-in-april/articleshow/109845710.cms,04-05-2024,"New Delhi: Better planning and advanced policy measures have ensured adequate power capacity availability without straining the supply chain as the country battles an unprecedented heat wave, said officials.
Electricity demand
surged 10.5% last month, with
peak power demand
hitting 224 GW on April 30, higher than last year's 216 GW.
""The major load is likely coming from air conditioners contributing to peak power demand, especially in the evening,"" said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.
The
heatwave
spell in eastern and southern peninsular India is expected to continue till May 6, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Thermal capacity availability has been a major source of relief, especially during non-solar hours, said another government official. The government's directive to power plants not to undertake maintenance shutdowns during the summer season has helped make required thermal capacity available during non-solar hours, he added.
Out of the 217 GW thermal power installed capacity, a gross of 190 GW has been online, higher than last year's 180 GW. Of the total electricity consumption, about 75% is being met through coal-based power. Capacity addition in conventional and green energy has added to the availability.

The government had directed fast-tracking of new capacity additions and utilisation of surplus power with captive generating stations for offering for sale on exchanges.
""
Solar power
itself has grown. Last year the availability was 46-48 GW and now it has touched 52 GW,"" the second official said.
Usually,
wind power
availability in April is less, but it was ""reasonably"" good last month, the official said, adding that during non-solar hours there has been support from wind of around 6-8 GW recently. On April 30, wind capacity availability went up to 14.5 GW. Gas-based power has been exceeding 10.5 GW this summer, and flexibility of hydro generation to run during non-solar hours has helped.
The demand during non-solar hours is important because almost 45-50 GW of monitored capacity, which is available during the day, is out of the system in the evening. The gap is filled by ramping up thermal power and other sources like hydro.

's
power consumption
rose around 11 per cent to 144.25 billion units (BU) in April as compared to the year-ago period, mainly due increase in temperatures. In April 2023, the power consumption stood at 130.08 BU, a government data showed.
The highest supply in a day (peak power demand) also rose to 224.18 GW in April 2024 as against to 215.88 GW in April 2023.
The
power ministry
has estimated around 260 GW of peak demand during summer.
Experts said the increase in power consumption as well as growth in demand was mainly due to increase in temperatures and increased
industrial activities
in sectors like steel and power.
The demand for power as well as consumption will continue to see robust growth with the onset of summer, they said.
Live Events
The power ministry had estimated the country's
electricity demand
to touch 229 GW during summer in 2023, but it did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rainfall.
Peak supply, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July.
Peak demand touched 238.82 GW in August 2023, while it was 243.27 GW in September, 222.16 GW in October, 204.77 GW in November, 213.79 GW in December 2023, 223.51 GW in January 2024, and 222.72 GW in February 2024.
Industry experts said power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June in 2023 due to widespread rainfall.
They said power consumption grew in August, September, and October, mainly due to humid weather conditions, and also a pick-up in industrial activities ahead of the festive season.

The NCLT had stayed the sale process of the project in June 2022 following a plea to consolidate the resolution of
KSK Mahanadi
and two of its ancillary companies, which are also under resolution process.
The current round is expected to garner a better valuation for the project, industry sources said.
Adani Power, Jindal Power and Vedanta, among others, were the bidders in the first round of auction as well.
""The plant is an operational one and of late there is a push to revive thermal power capacities that is why the interest in companies to bid for such projects,"" one of the persons said.
The stakeholders in the project earlier wanted resolution of associated projects - KSK Mahanadi Water, which operates a water pipeline to the power plant, and raw material-carrying Raigarh Champa Rail - to be consolidated.
After a delay, the committee of creditors agreed for KSK Mahanadi project to go standalone under the insolvency proceedings and moved a petition in the NCLT to remove the stay, ET reported earlier.
When the asset was first put up for auction, Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and its subsidiary REC, with NTPC as the technical partner, had also submitted a lenders-backed resolution plan for the project. The proposal was turned down by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). However, NTPC got the green signal for bidding.
State Bank of India was the major lender to the project until six asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), including those backed by Aditya Birla and Kotak Mahindra, accumulated 55% of the project's Rs 29,330 crore
debt
from lenders in March.
Among the ARCs, Aditya Birla ARC has the largest share of 33.38% in claims from KSK Mahanadi Power, followed by ASREC (India) Ltd, which has 11.98%.
Of the total lenders' claim of Rs 32,000 crore, Power Finance Corporation and REC have a claim of Rs 5,500 crore, according to one of the persons.

India expects annual power output to grow at fastest in over a decade,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-expects-annual-power-output-to-grow-at-fastest-in-over-a-decade/articleshow/109622272.cms,26-04-2024,"India
expects power generation to grow 9.3% to 1,900 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) during the fiscal year through March 2025, internal projections by the federal power ministry reviewed by Reuters show, the fastest pace of growth since at least 2011/12.
Searing heatwaves and an uptick in economic activity have resulted in India's
electricity generation
growing at an average of about 8% annually following the pandemic year of 2020/21, outpacing power demand growth in every major global economy.
India's weather office has forecast more heat-wave days than normal between April and June this year, potentially boosting power use and generation further.
This is expected to boost demand for fossil fuel-fired power, which is projected to grow about 9% and account for over 76% of total output for the second straight year, according to a power ministry document containing the internal projections.
Coal-fired
power output
is expected to rise 8.9% over the year, outpacing the growth projected for
renewable energy
output, according to the document. Natural gas-fired electricity generation is seen rising 10.5%, it showed.

India's renewable energy output - including solar, wind, small hydro plants and power from biomass - is expected to grow 8.2% in 2024/25 to 244 billion kWh, its slowest rise in four years. China's wind and solar output, in comparison, grew about 21% in calendar year 2023.
Despite increasing its renewable energy capacity to 143.65 GW, India is still short of a 2022 target of adding 175 GW of renewable energy to its grid. This failure to meet
renewable targets
has boosted India's dependence on coal and complicated efforts to wean its economy away from carbon.
Some clean energy sources of power generation, however, are expected to pick up this year.
Hydropower output, which recorded its steepest fall in at least 38 years in 2023/24, is expected to grow 10.3% this year, the ministry's projections showed.
India's weather office expects the country to receive above average monsoon rains in 2024. The annual monsoon delivers nearly 70% of India's annual rainfall, and plays a crucial role in recharging reservoirs used to generate electricity.
Nuclear output, which has remained flat for years, is expected to grow by nearly 16% over 2024/24, as existing nuclear plants boosted capacity by bringing new units online, the projections showed.

"Higher generation capacity, gas-based plants to help meet India's high summer power demand: Fitch",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/higher-generation-capacity-gas-based-plants-to-help-meet-indias-high-summer-power-demand-fitch/articleshow/109598907.cms,25-04-2024,"Fitch Ratings expects
India
's
power demand
to rise by 7-8 per cent year-on-year in second quarter of 2024 due to robust industrial activity, strong GDP growth and the
Indian Meteorological Department
's (IMD) forecast of above-normal temperatures during the summer months.
However, the rating agency believes much of this demand will be met through larger operating capacities, adequate coal inventory, and higher utilization of
gas-based plants
.
India's monthly power demand typically peaks in the pre-and post-monsoon months of May or August, as cooling demand picks up with the temperature rise.
IMD has predicted higher-than-normal maximum temperatures over most parts of the country till June 2024, further increasing demand.
At the same time, the rating agency expects distribution utilities to work towards minimizing supply disruptions due to India's general elections in April and May, given that power supply is a politically sensitive issue.
Live Events
On the supply side, the Indian Ministry of Power has directed both gas-based and imported-coal-based power stations to maintain availability to meet the anticipated demand.
""Utilisation of gas-based plants has been low in the past due to higher fuel prices or lack of availability of fuel,"" the rating agency said.
India has experienced strong growth in power demand, averaging 8.5 per cent a year over the last three years after the Covid-19 pandemic. It has met a large part of the increase through
thermal power plants
' higher plant load factors (PLFs), which have jumped by around 10 per cent to around 69.5 per cent over the last two years.
""Strong power demand bodes well for additions of renewable capacities and associated storage demand as India aims to meet ambitious long-term energy-transition goals,"" said the rating agency.
At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part ""Panchamrit"" pledge. They included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, to reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030.
India as a whole also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070.
About 44 per cent of India's energy requirements at present come from non-fossil sources and are likely to touch as high as 65 per cent by 2030, much higher than what the country pledged at the COP summit in 2021, Union Minister RK Singh, who handles power and renewable portfolio, said recently.

ONGC plans June drilling for India's first geothermal project in Ladakh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ongc-plans-june-drilling-for-indias-first-geothermal-project-in-ladakh/articleshow/109510347.cms,22-04-2024,"Oil and Natural Gas
Corp (
ONGC
) is planning to mount a fresh
drilling campaign
in June for
India
's first
geothermal project
after suffering a setback two years ago. If successful, the project could open a source for
emission-free
electricity,
space heating
, and irrigation in the cold and harsh terrains of
Ladakh
.
The company plans to begin drilling the first well in the second or third week of June and complete two geothermal wells of 1,000 meters depth each by September-end, ONGC energy centre director general Ravi, who is overseeing the project at Puga in Ladakh, told ET.
If all goes well, a power plant of at least 1 MW capacity will be set up by next year, he added. The geothermal wells help pipe hot water or steam to the surface, which then is used to power a turbine to generate electricity.
Water with a temperature of 220 degrees centigrade is expected at Puga. The steam could be first used to produce electricity and then for space heating, aqua farming and herbal spa. ONGC is being advised by consultants from
Iceland
, a country that depends on geothermal for two-thirds of its primary energy.
In 2022, ONGC had to abandon a well it was trying to drill after encountering a high volume of uncontrolled water. This time the contractor would have advanced equipment, including a blow-out preventor, to mitigate those challenges. Last year, no drilling contractor showed interest in the project due to logistical challenges.

""In Puga, we have a limited window for actual work, between June and September. It's too cold after that. Before April, roads are covered with ice and so not accessible,"" said Ravi, adding that cold weather, less oxygen in the atmosphere, and logistics have been big challenges. Due to lower oxygen levels, planes can't carry very heavy equipment to the project site, Ravi said. Trucks also have to take a longer route to the site as some bridges can't take heavier loads.
ONGC has already awarded the drilling contract for the project this summer. Third-party inspection of equipment is currently being carried out at the contractor's sites and the mobilisation will start in the first week of May, Ravi said.

India's power consumption rises nearly 10 pc to 70.66 bn units in first half of April,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-rises-nearly-10-pc-to-70-66-bn-units-in-first-half-of-april/articleshow/109370472.cms,17-04-2024,"NEW DELHI:
India's power consumption
grew nearly 10 per cent year-on-year to 70.66 billion units (BU) in the first half of April this year, showing improvement in economic activities and
consumption patterns
, according to the power ministry data. According to the data,
power consumption
in the country rose to 70.66 BU during April 1-15 this year from 64.24 MU in the year-ago period.
The peak power demand met or the highest supply in a day rose to about 218 GW in the first half of April compared to 206 GW in the same period a year ago.
The highest supply in a day during the entire month of April last year was about 216 GW.
The ministry has projected a peak power demand of 260 GW during the summer season (April to June) in view of longer heat wave duration. The peak power demand had touched an all-time high of 243 GW in September 2023.
The
India Meteorological Department
(
IMD
) has predicted above-normal maximum temperatures in most parts of the country during summer this year.
Live Events
The experts said that the power demand will increase in the coming days as rains in different parts of the country have reduced the need for cooling appliances like air conditioners, desert coolers etc used during this time of the year.
However, they said that power consumption growth in double digits shows improvement in economic activities and change in consumption patterns.
They are of the view that the consumers in India are also increasing their energy consumption on various appliances and gadgets as is being done in the developed world.
Besides, they pointed out that the increase in electricity in the transport sector like electric buses, cars, rickshaws and railways has also changed the consumption pattern and increased per capita use.

Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd
against it be dismissed given that the PSU had not completed the project as per the contract.
The case has been dragging on for over four years, where
BHEL
has contested that HNPCL failed to make a payment of ₹281 crore towards the works it had carried out.
The
Hyderabad
bench of the

The counsel for HNPCL said the company had paid ₹3,800 crore to BHEL for setting up two 520 MW coal-based power-generating units at its Vizag thermal power project but withheld the last instalment of the payment as the units had not cleared the final acceptance test and other evaluation parameters.
""The company has an investment of around ₹12,000 crore, and we have money to pay, but BHEL hasn't completed the work,"" the counsel said.

The counsel also claimed that the PSU was to complete the work by 2013, but it managed to achieve operational clearance only by 2016.
He also argued that BHEL did not attach an invoice to the demand notice sent under Section 8 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Moreover, the company had sent two demand notices, which is also in violation of the rules, he argued.
An operational creditor must send a demand notice to initiate insolvency proceedings.
BHEL's counsel said the plant was operational, so the company had fulfilled its obligation under the contract.

While the company had secured financing facilities from various banks under various agreements, its account was declared as NPA in 2016 due to non-payment.
However, the parties entered into a master resolution agreement in 2021 and Jindal India accordingly deposited the resolution amount in tranches till April 2022.
However, the banks had agreed to release only 63.59% pledged shares and retain 10% equity shares to be transferred and distributed amongst themselves as a one-time settlement between the parties.
Despite 10% equity being retained by the lenders and all the terms and conditions of the agreement having been complied with, Jindal’s account was still classified as an NPA, the company said.
Some of the lenders had contented that Jindal India being an unlisted company, they have to safeguard their interests so that an option is available to them to exit and liquidate their share, thus a Share Purchase Agreement /Share Holder Agreement, had to be entered between the parties.

In October, the duration for running these imported coal based power plants at full capacity was further extended till June 30, 2024.
Peak power demand was estimated to touch a record high of 229 GW during summer in 2023.
However, unseasonal rains affected demand as people used fewer cooling appliances like air conditioners which guzzle electricity.
The 15 imported coal-based (ICB) power plants that have been directed to run their plants at full capacity include
Tata Power
and
Adani Power
's plants at Mundra in Gujarat; Essar power plant in Salaya; JSW Ratnagiri; Tata Trombay; Udupi Power; Meenakshi Energy; and JSW Torangallu.
The ministry has been saying that in the likely scenario of a gap in demand and supply of domestic coal and essential requirement of maintaining coal stock at generating stations, the use of imported coal needs to be increased by way of blending with domestic fuel in domestic coal-based plants and also by ensuring optimum generation from ICB plants.
This will ease the pressure on domestic coal supply and also ensure that all plants are available during the peak demand period, it had noted.
The ministry has provided for pass through of higher cost of imported coal as well as the provision of sale of excess power in exchanges.

RP sets date for second bidding for KSK Mahanadi resolution,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/rp-sets-date-for-second-bidding-for-ksk-mahanadi-resolution/articleshow/109294208.cms,15-04-2024,"The
resolution professional
(RP) for the
KSK Mahanadi
Power Co Ltd has set April 26 as the date for fresh expressions of interest (EOI) to take over the 1800 MW power plant in a second round of bidding after plans by creditors
Power Finance Corp
(PFC) and
Rural Electrification Corp
(REC) to take over the company did not receive government approval.
In a regulatory Form G which sets out the timeline for resolution, RP Suresh Binani has set 18 June as the final date for bidders to give a plan. The company owes creditors Rs 32,240 crore out of which more than Rs 29,000 crore is owed to financial creditors according to the latest list of creditors updated earlier this month.
The Chhattisgarh based power producer is a rare operational plant of its size available for a takeover in the country. As a result a half a dozen asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) have accumulated the debt from banks in the hope of finding good value from buyers. Out of the six units of 600 MW coal based plant planned, three units of 600 MW are operational currently totalling 1800 MW.
Aditya Birla ARC is the largest creditor with admitted claims of Rs 9800 crore or 33% of the total debt followed by PFC with about Rs 4400 crore or 15%. REC is the third largest creditor with Rs 3538 crore or 12% of the debt. Another ARC Asrec has also accumulated 12% or Rs 3506 crore of the debt.
""Most banks have sold their debt to ARCs over the years due to the delays in the resolution of this asset because there has been demand from ARCs to accumulate this asset in hopes of a resolution. There are expectations that large power producers will look at this acquisition favourably,"" said a person who has tracked this process.

The resolution process for KSK Mahanadi has undergone various twists since being admitted for insolvency in 2019.
In the initial round of bidding in 2021 the company received EOIs from a dozen bidders including large corporate groups like
Vedanta
,
Adani Power
, Naveen Jindal’s Jindal Power, Jindal Polymer and also creditors PFC-REC and
NTPC
.
Lenders had petitioned the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) to consolidate the resolution of two other related companies, KSK Mahanadi Water, which operates a water pipeline to the power plant and raw material-carrying Raigarh Champa Rail after bidders had expressed apprehension that buying the power plant without these supporting companies will be of little value. As a result, the court stayed the standalone resolution process of KSK Mahanadi Power in 2022.
After almost a two year delay lenders withdrew their petition to consolidate the resolution process and are now going for a separate process for the power company.
In a related development, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) rejected the proposal by PFC-REC to submit a resolution plan because it involved infusion of fresh funds and business risks, ET reported in its April 12 edition.
""After almost five years the process is starting again. It is expected that all large power producers in India will be interested in this asset,"" said the person cited above.
In the note accompanying the Form G, Binani has said that the resolution applicants who were in the final list in the last process conducted in December 2021 will only be required to submit their latest information as ther EOl is already assumed to be deemed accepted.
The company had made revenues of Rs 5116 crore in the fiscal ended March 2023 and has more than 1000 employees and workmen.

All gas-fired power plants to operate in May-June,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/all-gas-fired-power-plants-to-operate-in-may-june/articleshow/109276554.cms,14-04-2024,"The government on Saturday directed all gas-based power plants to operate in May and June amid an anticipated increase in
demand
during the summer months, invoking a key provision in the Electricity Act. This is the first time that the government is using Section 11 of the
Electricity Act
, 2003 for gas-based plants. The provision, which allows the government in extraordinary circumstances to ask a power generation company to operate and maintain production in accordance with its directions, has so far been invoked only for power plants using imported coal as fuel. India’s power demand is rising and is expected to peak in the coming months with the
India Meteorological Department
predicting above-normal maximum temperatures over most parts of the country till June. This is also the time when
India
will be holding elections. During non-solar hours, when renewable electricity generation falls, peak demand is majorly met by power plants running on coal and lignite. A significant portion of the gas-based power capacity is unutilised due to commercial reasons.

Govt asks all gas-based plants to be operational from May 1 to June 30 as electricity demand surges,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/govt-asks-all-gas-based-plants-to-be-operational-from-may-1-to-june-30-as-electricity-demand-surges/articleshow/109265950.cms,13-04-2024,"The government has directed all
gas-based power
generating stations to operationalise their plants from May 1 to June 30 in view of rise in
electricity demand
due to a likely prolonged heat wave this summer. A significant portion of Gas-Based Generating Stations (GBSs) is currently unutilized, primarily due to commercial considerations.
The ministry has projected 260 GW
peak power demand
this summer (April to June 2024). Peak power demand had touched an all-time high of 243 GW in September last year.
The decision to operationalise GBSs is part of a series of measures taken by the Centre to ensure that electricity demand in the summer is met.
According to a power ministry statement, the order shall remain valid for generation and supply of electricity from May 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024.
""To ensure maximum
power generation
from Gas-Based Generating Stations, the government has issued directions to all Gas-Based Generating Stations under Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003, under which the appropriate government may specify that a generating company shall, in extraordinary circumstances operate and maintain any generating station in accordance with the directions of that government,"" the statement said.

The order under Section 11, which is on similar lines as done for imported coal-based power plants, aims to optimise the availability of power from GBSs during the ensuing high demand period.
As per the arrangement, GRID-INDIA will inform GBSs in advance, of the number of days for which gas-based power is required.
GBSs holding Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with distribution licensees shall first offer their power to PPA holders.
If the power offered is not utilised by any PPA holder, then it shall be offered in the power market.
GBSs not tied to PPAs must offer their generation in the power market. A high-level committee headed by Chairperson, Central Electricity Authority has been constituted to facilitate the implementation of this direction.
Other measures taken by the government to meet the
summer demand
include planned maintenance of power plants to be shifted to monsoon season; new capacity additions to be fast-tracked and partial outages of thermal power plants being brought down.
India's electricity demand has been rising rapidly, driven by economic growth, particularly during hot-weather and high-demand periods.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted above-normal maximum temperatures over most parts of the country during the 2024 summer.

has extended a mandate on imported coal-based
power plants
to operate at full capacity until Oct. 15 to meet anticipated high demand for electricity in the summer months, according to a government order seen by Reuters.
The order, dated Friday, invoked an emergency clause available to the government in directing the companies, including
Tata Power

Adani Power
, operating such imported
coal
fired plants with a capacity of nearly 16 gigawatts to continue operations.
The order is not yet public. The plants were initially allowed to operate until June 30.

KSK Mahanadi likely to undergo fresh bidding,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ksk-mahanadi-likely-to-undergo-fresh-bidding/articleshow/109227011.cms,12-04-2024,"The debt-ridden
KSK Mahanadi
project may soon undergo a fresh round of bidding as the
National Company Law Tribunal
(
NCLT
) has vacated a stay on the resolution plan proceedings and allowed issuance of fresh expression of interest.
The move will give a chance for a better valuation for the 1,800-MW project, which saw interest from the likes of
Adani Power
,
Jindal Power and Vedanta Ltd
in the first round of auctions, people close to the development said.
The NCLT had stayed the sale process for the project in June 2022 following a plea to consolidate the resolution of KSK Mahanadi and two of its ancillary companies, which are also under resolution process.
The tribunal removed the stay on April 5. The concern in the matter was to consolidate resolution of associated projects - KSK Mahanadi Water, which operates a water pipeline to the power plant, and raw material-carrying
Raigarh Champa Rail
.
After a delay, lenders recently agreed for KSK Mahanadi project to go standalone under the insolvency proceedings and moved a petition in the NCLT to remove the stay, said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.

DIPAM rejects PFC-REC debt resolution proposal for KSK Mahanadi project,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/dipam-rejects-pfc-rec-debt-resolution-proposal-for-ksk-mahanadi-project/articleshow/109204704.cms,11-04-2024,"New Delhi: The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (
DIPAM
) has turned down
Power Finance Corporation
(PFC) and
REC Ltd
’s proposal for a debt resolution plan for the beleaguered 1,800-MW KSK Mahanadi Power Company project.
The state-owned duo had sought approval from the department to participate in the ongoing
insolvency
proceedings by submitting a debt resolution plan, said people aware of the development.
However, DIPAM rejected the proposal with a view that lenders’ backed resolution plan, in this context, should normally be avoided as it involves additional resource infusion and business risks, they said.
ET’s queries emailed to PFC, its subsidiary REC and DIPAM did not elicit any response till press time.
The project is undergoing insolvency proceedings, but the resolution of the project was stalled after the National Company Law Tribunal stayed the sale process in June 2022 following a plea to consolidate the resolution of KSK Mahanadi Power Company and two of its ancillary companies, which are also under a resolution process.
Live Events
Lenders are now willing to let the project go standalone under the proceedings, said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.
When the asset was first put up for auction under the insolvency proceedings, REC and PFC, with
NTPC Ltd
as the technical partner,
Vedanta Ltd
,
Adani Power Ltd
, and
Jindal Power Ltd
were among the companies that had shown interest.
“More companies have shown interest in participating in the acquisition of the asset. It is good for the valuation of the project,” said another person.
State Bank of India was the major lender to the project until six asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), including Aditya Birla and Kotak Mahindra-backed ARCs, recently accumulated 55% of the project’s Rs 29,330 crore debt from the lenders.
The total claim by lenders in the project is about Rs 32,000 crore, of which PFC and REC have Rs 5,500 crore, according to people in the know.
Among ARCs, Aditya Birla ARC has largest share of 33.38% in claims from KSK Mahanadi Power Company, followed by ASREC (India) Ltd which has 11.98%
The proposal was on similar grounds as that of Lanco Amarkantak, where the companies had bid for the project. PFC and REC and Reliance Industries had withdrawn their bids later, with the project finally landing with Adani Power for Rs 4,101 crore.

Power Minister RK Singh warns of debt trap for using borrowed money to provide free electricity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-minister-rk-singh-warns-of-debt-trap-for-using-borrowed-money-to-provide-free-electricity/articleshow/109106100.cms,07-04-2024,"Power Minister
RK Singh
has warned of a debt trap for states like Punjab using borrowed money to provide free electricity, saying such populist schemes are fine only if a state has finances. Electricity, like any other commodity, involves the cost of generating it, and if a state is to provide it for free to a section of consumers, it also needs to have finances to pay the generating utility. If the generating utility isn't paid,
electricity
will not be produced in the first place.
In an interview with PTI, Singh said he has been telling states that electricity is not free. ""If any state wants to give free power to any category of people, they can go ahead and do so, but you have to pay for it"".
However, states with already high debt are resorting to such populist measures, forcing them to borrow more to pay generating utilities, resulting in a debt trap.
""You should not be bringing your state to a situation where it falls into a debt trap. Many of the states are close to debt traps because of freebies,"" the minister said.
Asked to name states that do so, the bureaucrat-turned-politician said, ""For example Punjab"".

Since coming to power in Punjab in 2022, the
Aam Aadmi Party
(AAP) government has taken several populist measures, including free power up to 300 units per household.
Punjab borrowed as much as Rs 47,000 crore in the first two years of the AAP government, adding to the already high debt of the state. This has strained finances where a good part of the tax revenues earned went into paying interest and principal of the previous borrowing.
""Many of these states are close to debt trap,"" Singh said.
He explained further that states are borrowing to give freebies so that they can stay in power, and the burden is being shifted onto the succeeding generations.
For future generations, there will be no money for roads, building hospitals, and schools because whatever revenues will come will go into repayment of loans, he added.
When asked to give an example he said, ""For example Punjab. Many of these states are close to debt trap"".
About the power pilferage, he said, ""The AT&C (aggregate technical and commercial losses) losses used to be 27 per cent. Today it is 15 per cent, and nobody thought it would be possible. I have done it by a combination of various measures. Incentives, legal penalties, everything"".
He also stated that he wants to further bring it (AT&T losses) down to about 10-12 per cent.
Singh also stated that many states had outstanding dues of Rs 20-30 thousand crore, which have been brought down.
""So, I made monthly instalments in the rule itself (for repayment of outstanding overdue). As a result, current dues are up to date, arrears have come down to Rs 40,000 crore from 1.45 lakh crore,"" he said.
When asked about providing the consumer with the option of multiple service providers, the minister promised to get through the required amendments in the Electricity Act 2003.
The minister introduced the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2022, for the purpose in the
Lok Sabha
on August 8, 2022, which was sent to the
standing committee
for vetting on the same day.
The committee has not given its report on the bill. But since the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha, the new government will have to introduce it again.
""I will table it again. So, what will happen (upon the passage of the bill)? There will be a competition, and there will be better services. The regulator will fix the ceiling price. If someone (operator) asks for Rs 4 per unit and another 3.5 per unit, you will prefer that (Rs 3.5).
""So, we tabled the amendment. It went to the committee. It is there only. I will have to table it again,"" Singh said.
About the ambitious renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030, he informed that India will achieve the target and has already locked in around 360 GW of renewables, which includes 190 GW of operational capacity.
""...my installed capacity of RE is about 190 GW, I have 103 GW under construction, that makes it 290 GW. I have 72 GW under bids. So, I am already at about 360 GW. I will reach it before time as I reach all my targets,"" the minister said.
Replying to a query about his top priorities if the BJP-led government wins the general election and he again becomes the power minister, Singh said the priority, as of now, is to add more capacity as fast as possible.
""I see my demand doubling by 2030. Imagine for a country like ours demand going up from 243 GW to I think the demand put 2032 to be almost 400 GW. I think it will be slightly more,"" he added.
About the planned addition of 80 GW more coal-based thermal power capacity, he stated, ""I am not going to compromise on the availability of power. Right now I have lots of solar, but at night you don't have solar. So, at night, you need electricity. Wind blowing is not there in the morning and evening...sometimes"".
He also said for phasing out coal-based thermal power generation capacity, there is a need for viable storage as it is required for round-the-clock renewable energy.

"Amid rising likelihood of a scorcher of a summer, govt powers up to help India fight extreme temperature",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/amid-rising-likelihood-of-a-scorcher-of-a-summer-govt-powers-up-to-help-india-fight-extreme-temperature/articleshow/109037077.cms,04-04-2024,"The government is going all out to make sure that power supply remains uninterrupted this summer, Power minister
RK Singh
said on April 1.
The government is pulling out all stops to ensure that thermal plants - the mainstay of India's power supply - have sufficient coal stocks to last through June, news agency PTI reported.
Thermal power plants have been asked to carry out ""advance planning"" for power generation and avoid maintenance during the summer season, with a target of ""zero load-shedding"" during this summer.
Besides, all plants that are closed for maintenance or other reasons have been directed to start operating on priority. They have also been asked to harness surplus power available at generating stations that exclusively cater to specific users.
All units have been told to make available their uncontracted/surplus power in power exchanges. The govt is mobilising the country's entire capacity -- be it thermal, hydro, renewable or gas-based, Singh told PTI in an interview.
Live Events
The
Power ministry
forecasts a peak demand of 260 GW this summer, surpassing last year's record of 243 GW in September.
The ministry had a peak power forecast of 229GW last year, but unexpected rains led to a record high demand of 243GW in September 2023.
The Indian Meteorological Department (
IMD
) predicts extreme heat in India during April-June this year, particularly impacting central and western regions.
More heatwave days are expected this year in most of the plains during summer, the IMD says. There is also a prediction of an increase in heat waves, with 10 to 20 days expected compared to the usual 4 to 8 days.
According to Singh currently there is coal stock of around 45 million tonnes (at power plants), which is sufficient.
""I am trying to take almost all the capacities online. Whatever (plant or generation capacity) is down either for planned maintenance (completed already) or whatever (plant) is on unplanned outage, we are trying to bring them online,"" PTI quoted Singh as saying.
Power demand has gone up 9.5 per cent in the last year, the minister said. ""The peak demand in 2013-14 was 130 GW to 140 GW. Today it is 243 GW. So it has gone up by 80 per cent,"" he added.
It may be mentioned here that India has added capacity of about 200 GW which is mostly renewable.
More capacity is being added, Singh informed. We are setting up about 80 GW of thermal capacity. We have about 15 GW of hydro capacity under construction. I also have 103 GW of renewable energy capacity under construction,"" he said.
India's peak power demand is expected to touch400 GW by 2032.
Several key meetings have already been held by the govt with officials. One of the aims of these meeting has been to ""prevent a situation in which one state has surplus power while others face power shortages,"" Singh informed.
Singh had earlier held a series of meetings with officials and emphasised the need for ensuring zero load shedding during the summer season.
During the review meetings, Singh stressed that adequate advance planning should be done by all stakeholders, so as to prevent a situation in which one state has surplus power while others face power shortages.
Some key takeaways from preparatory meetings
With regard to coal-based plants, govt may extend directions under section 11 that provides for running the power plants at full capacity, up to September 30, 2024.
The ministry has also directed power plants to shift their planned maintenance to the monsoon season instead of April-June.
The quantum of capacity under partial outages has come down and measures have been suggested to further reduce them.
Govt has reviewed the status of 5.2 GW of non-operational thermal capacity and had directed that capacity additions in coal, hydro, nuclear, solar and wind would be monitored, so as to expedite their commissioning.
Thermal generating stations must offer their un-requisitioned/surplus power in power exchanges, as mandated by the recently notified rules.
As per official data, peak energy demand rose by 12.7 per cent from 2,15,888 MW in 2022-23 to 2,43,271 MW in 2023-24. While the peak demand met grew by 13.9 per cent from 2,10,725 MW in 2022-23 to 2,39,931 MW in 2023-24, Power ministry's records show.

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd
is in preliminary talks with atomic power monopoly to build small nuclear units, an early-stage technology seen as a cost-effective alternative to larger plants.
The refiner and fuel retailer is exploring a partnership with state-controlled Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd to use small modular reactors, or SMRs, in its refineries for clean power,
Alok Sharma
, Indian Oil's director for R&D, said at a conference in New Delhi Wednesday.
As several bigger projects face delays, policymakers are promoting small-scale nuclear technology with a capacity of up to 300 MW, which is quicker to build and easier to adjust to the requirements of the grid. To boost the nascent sector, the government is considering allowing private firms to manage and operate reactors.
Besides Indian Oil,
NTPC Ltd
and
ONGC
are among companies exploring opportunities in nuclear.

India eyes 100 GW nuclear power by 2047: AEC chairman,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-eyes-100-gw-nuclear-power-by-2047-aec-chairman/articleshow/109012593.cms,03-04-2024,"India
aims to produce 1 lakh MW of
nuclear power
by 2047, a massive increase from the current production of over 8,000 MW,
Atomic Energy Commission
Chairman A K Mohanty said here on Wednesday. Mohanty was speaking at the release of a report, 'Synchronising Energy Transitions Towards Possible Net Zero for India: Affordable and Clean Energy for All', largely funded by the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the government of India.
Ravi B Grover, Chairman Emeritus of the
Homi Bhabha National Institute
, said the report was necessary as studies for
energy transition
for India have come up with a very insignificant role for nuclear citing high input cost and lower public acceptance.
Mohanty said a vision document for 'Amrit Kaal' was being prepared by the
Department of Atomic Energy
which envisages reaching a nuclear capacity of about 100
GW
by 2047.
He said the
breeder reactors
would contribute 3 GW of nuclear power, while 17.6 GW would come from light water reactors built with international cooperation and another 40-45 GW would come from the pressurised heavy water reactors.
The report released on Wednesday stated that if India planned to phase down coal usage in the next three decades, it would need to build adequate infrastructure for alternative sources such as nuclear power, in addition to flexible grid infrastructure and storage to support the integration of renewable energy.

Power ministry prepares for the summer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-ministry-prepares-for-the-summer/articleshow/108983853.cms,02-04-2024,"NEW DELHI: The
power ministry
has worked out a multi-pronged approach to prepare for the summer, including extending the mandate for imported coal-based units to run at full capacity till September and exploring the possibility of using
surplus power
from captive plants, according to a statement released Tuesday.
The current direction for plants to run at maximum capacity, under Section 11 of The Electricity Act, 2003, ends in June.
Power minister
RK Singh
held a series of meetings to review the power capacities and preparations for the summer that is expected to exhibit above-normal temperatures in most parts of the country, according to the statement. A peak demand of 260 GW is expected between April and June, higher than the peak of 243 GW recorded last year in September.
The ministry will also examine if similar directions could be extended to gas-based
power plants
to ensure they operate in coming months.

India continues to rely heavily on coal to meet projected 260 GW peak demand in summer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-continues-to-rely-heavily-on-coal-to-meet-projected-260-gw-peak-demand-in-summer/articleshow/108978209.cms,02-04-2024,"New Delhi:
India
will continue to rely heavily on
electricity
generated using
coal
during the ensuing summer season when peak demand is projected to cross 260 gigawatts (GW) on likely intense heat conditions in parts of the country, a power ministry official said on Tuesday. While
renewable capacities
continue to be added, authorities are building coal stocks at
power plants
to meet the peak demand, the official said, adding that
solar power
would also help immensely in meeting the demand.
The ministry, which has been reviewing the situation regularly, has directed all power generating companies, especially
thermal plants
, to delay their maintenance plans, while gas-based power plants have been told to be available for generating electricity.
The Indian Meteorological Department on Tuesday forecasted that India is set to experience extreme heat during the April-June (summer) period, with the central and western peninsular parts expected to face the worst impact.
Besides, above-normal heatwave days are likely over most parts of the plains during summer. Ten to 20 days of heat waves are expected in different parts of the country against a normal of four to eight days, as per IMD projections.
According to estimates by the power ministry, the peak demand in the country could reach 260 GW during this summer, higher than the record 243 GW in September last year.

The official told PTI, on the condition of anonymity, that this time hydropower generation would be lesser compared to last year due to the low level of water in reservoirs across the country.
Therefore, coal-based thermal power plants and solar energy will meet a large part of the high demand for electricity in the country during this summer.
The official informed that Union Power Minister R K Singh and other top officials in the ministry are holding review meetings on the anticipated situation of extreme heat wave in the country with other ministries like railways and coal, state officials, and power companies for the past 15 days.
The review meetings are done every year before summer by the ministry, but this time, demand is expected to be at an all-time high level of 260GW in the country.
The official also stated that the ministry has asked all power-generating companies, especially thermal plants, to delay their maintenance plans as it is very time-consuming.
It takes more than three days to close down a coal-based thermal power plant for maintenance and the same amount of time it takes to restart.
The official also said that the power ministry has also asked all gas-based power plants to be available for generation to meet the sudden surge in electricity demand in the country.
According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), India has about 25GW of gas-based power generation capacity.
Coal and lignite-based thermal power capacity is around 216 GW in the country and serves as the base load.
Solar capacity is around 76GW, while wind energy stands at 45GW as of the February report of the CEA.
Similarly, the large hydro (more than 25MW plants) power capacity is around 47 GW in the country.
The total installed power generation capacity in the country is around 434 GW.
The official also informed that the power ministry has already taken steps to augment coal supplies at thermal power plants, which includes blending of 6 per cent imported coal and must run direction for imported coal-based plants.
According to the latest report of the CEA of March 31, 2024, 185 power plants in the country monitored by it had 73 per cent of the normative coal stock.
These power plants had 50.59 million tonnes of coal against the normative stock of 69.25 million tonnes.

Power plants end 2023-24 with 50.7 million tonnes of coal stock,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-plants-end-2023-24-with-50-million-tonnes-of-coal-stock/articleshow/108941619.cms,01-04-2024,"NEW DELHI:
Thermal power plants
started 2024-25 with 50.7 million tonnes of
coal stock
, about 37% higher year-on-year and around a quarter more than the government’s initial target to end 2023-24 with 40 million tonnes.
The coal stock at plants will give the
power sector
room to meet the upcoming
summer demand
and allay logistical constraints during the high demand period.
Of the total stock, domestic coal-based units accounted for about 47.3 million tonnes.
Overall coal stock in the country, including that in transit and at mines, was about 160 million tonnes as of March-end, higher than the expected 140 million tonnes by the end of 2023-24.
“The production capacity (from mines) rose, including contributions from captive and commercial mines. Better logistics and coordination between power plants and miners were other contributing factors in the rise,” a government official said on condition of anonymity.

between April and June would reach 260 GW, higher than the peak of 243 GW recorded last year in September.
The
India Meteorological Department
(IMD) predicts higher-than-normal temperatures this summer.
Above-normal maximum temperatures are likely to prevail over most parts of the country during the hot weather season of March-May, the IMD had said last month.
Preparations are on to meet the summer demand with coal stock at power plants being more than anticipated.
Thermal power is the mainstay of meeting peak demand, which has been constantly increasing. Peak demand in 2023-24 surpassed projections of 231 GW as early as April.
The March-May period last year saw relatively lower demand for electricity because of favourable weather conditions.
The power ministry has raised its target of thermal power capacity addition to 85 GW by 2031-32, as against the earlier aim of 50 GW, because of increasing demand and base load requirement.

India's power consumption rises 1.4 pc to 129.89 billion units in March,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-rises-1-4-pc-to-129-89-billion-units-in-march/articleshow/108937078.cms,01-04-2024,"India
's
power consumption
growth remained subdued at 1.4 per cent to 129.89 billion units (BU) in
March
as compared to the year-ago period mainly due to pleasant weather, according to government data. In March 2023, power consumption stood at 128.12 BU, lower than 128.47 BU recorded in the same month a year earlier, the data showed.
The highest supply in a day (peak power demand) rose to 221.70 GW in March 2024 as opposed to 208.92 GW in March 2023 and 199.43 GW in March 2022.
Experts said power consumption as well as demand growth remained subdued in March as the weather remained pleasant across the country and people did not feel the need for heating or cooling appliances, especially in north India.
The power ministry has estimated around 260 GW of peak demand during
summer
.
The experts said power demand as well as consumption will see robust growth April onwards with the onset of summer.
Live Events
The power ministry had estimated the country's
electricity demand
to touch 229 GW during summer in 2023, but it did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rainfall.
Peak supply, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July.
Peak demand touched 238.82 GW in August 2023, while it was 243.27 GW in September, 222.16 GW in October, 204.77 GW in November, 213.79 GW in December 2023, 223.51 GW in January 2024 and 222.72 GW in February 2024.
Industry experts said power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June in 2023 due to widespread rainfall.
They said power consumption grew in August, September, and October, mainly due to humid weather conditions, and also a pick-up in industrial activities ahead of the festive season.
Experts are expecting steady power consumption growth due to improvement in economic activities and onset of summer in March.

India hydropower output records steepest fall in nearly four decades,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-hydropower-output-records-steepest-fall-in-nearly-four-decades/articleshow/108936440.cms,01-04-2024,"India's
hydroelectricity output
fell at the steepest pace in at least 38 years during the year ended March 31, a Reuters analysis of government data showed, as erratic rainfall forced further dependence on coal-fired power amid higher demand.
The 16.3% drop in generation from the country's biggest clean energy source coincided with the share of renewables in power generation sliding for the first time since Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
made commitments to boost solar and wind capacity at the United Nations climate talks at Paris in 2015.
Renewables accounted for 11.7% of India's power output in the year that ended in March, down from 11.8% a year earlier, a Reuters analysis of daily load despatch data from the federal grid regulator Grid-India showed.
India is the world's third-largest
greenhouse gas
emitter, and the government often points to lower per-capita emissions compared to developed nations to defend rising
coal
use.
A five-year low in reservoir levels means hydro output will likely remain low during the hottest months of April-June, experts say, potentially boosting dependence on coal during a period of high demand before the monsoon starts in June.

K. J. Ramesh, former chief of the Indian Meteorological Department, said there is increased chance of high rainfall during the annual monsoon this year, but any impact on
hydropower
output would not be visible before July.
""When hydro increases due to good rainfall, it should be used to reduce dependence on thermal,"" he said, adding that erratic rainfall means India should not count on hydro as a reliable power source in the future.
Declining Share
Hydro's share in India's total power output fell to a record low of 8.3% during the fiscal year ended March 31, Grid-India data showed, compared with an average of 12.3% in the 10 years through 2020.
The share of hydropower has steadily declined in recent years amid a slowdown in addition of new capacity, with other sources including coal, solar and wind gaining share.
The lightest rainfall since 2018 meant reduced water levels in reservoirs, pushing annual hydro generation to a five-year low of 146 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Meanwhile, power generation from coal and lignite in 2023/24 rose 13.9%, outpacing the 9.7% increase in renewable sources' output, data from the grid regulator showed. Total power generation rose 10.3% in 2023/24, Grid-India data showed.
India missed a 2022 target to install 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy, and remains 38.4 GW short of that goal, with Grid-India data showing India's dependence on fossil fuel for power hit a five-year high of 77.2% in 2023/24.
India's addition of renewables slowed to a five-year low in 2023.
Globally, hydropower output fell for only the fourth time since 2000 due to lower rainfall and warmer temperature brought about by the El Nino weather pattern, according to energy think tank Ember. Hydro output in India, the sixth-biggest hydropower producer, fell nearly seven times faster than the global average, Ember data showed.

SKS Power resolution faces roadblock as HC orders CBI probe,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sks-power-resolution-faces-roadblock-as-hc-orders-cbi-probe/articleshow/108883082.cms,29-03-2024,"Debt resolution
of SKS Power Generation (Chhattisgarh), currently in administration, is likely to be stalled after the
Allahabad High Court
directed the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe charges of misappropriation and other financial irregularities against the company and its linked entities.
In an order dated March 19, the Allahabad High Court directed an investigation against SKS Power Generation (SKSPGL) and its affiliates for the illicit transfer of funds to two British Overseas Territories — the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda — through fictitious companies. The order said these funds were allegedly used to purchase
SKSPGL
’s assets in collaboration with bank officials, violating central bank guidelines.
The court has also directed the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (
SFIO
) to conduct
forensic audits
.
The division bench comprising Justice Vinod Diwakar and Justice Vivek Kumar Birla passed the order following a petition from a teacher and social worker who alleged fraud being committed by SKS Power Generation and its affiliates.
Torrent Power
and
Sharda Energy
and Power are the two entities in the fray to acquire the 600 MW power generation company. The committee of creditors last year approved a ₹1,800-crore debt resolution plan for Sharda Energy. However, Torrent Power claimed it gave a higher offer and alleged an improper sale process.

The matter is being heard at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
Bank of Baroda
and the
State Bank of India
(
SBI
) advanced claims of ₹1,890 crore from the power generating company.
Justifying the need to transfer the case to
CBI
, the court stated that local police was biased and failed to uncover the financial fraud.
The order stated that between 2010-11 and 2017-18, the company availed ₹6,170 crore loans from several lenders, including State Bank of India, L&T Infrastructure and PTC Finance. After it defaulted, SBI seized the assets and sold the company to Agritrade Resources following a bidding process.
“Entwickeln India Energy Pvt Ltd, (a subsidiary of Agritrade) acquired all shares from SBI Trust at a significantly reduced price, with the bank allegedly waiving the interest rate on the loan and even reversing the entire interest amount of ₹820 crore, considering it as deemed capital contribution from the holding company,” the order stated.
Entwickeln issued compulsory convertible debentures to SKS Power Generation at an undervalued price and consequently, SKS Power became the holding company of Entwickeln India Energy, allegedly resulting in an illicit loss to the bank amounting to ₹5,717 crore, the order said.
The order said that 46 fictitious companies were “purportedly incorporated at the behest of SKS group entities” directors, engaging in round-tripping funds through bogus share transactions, resulting in a massive profit in thousands of crores for SKS Power Generation group companies.

Mahan is located in
Singrauli district
, Madhya Pradesh. Mahan Energen, which was incorporated in 2005, has a total capacity of 1,200 MW currently. The unit was formerly owned by Essar Power. Adani Power completed the acquisition for Rs 4,250 crore in March last year, after emerging as a successful bidder in June 2021.
Mahan’s turnover, according to audited standalone financial statements for FY23, FY22 and FY21 was Rs 2,730.68 crore, Rs 1,393.59 crore, and Rs 692.03 crore, respectively. “The investment is not a related party transaction and none of the company’s promoter/promoter group/group companies have any interest in the investment,” RIL said, adding that the deal was subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of requisite approvals by Mahan Energen.
CONSOLIDATING DEBT
In a separate regulatory announcement, Adani Power said it had consolidated different short-term loan facilities worth Rs 19,700 crore — and availed of by six special purpose vehicles (SPVs) — into a single long-term debt. Under the revised arrangement, the company will benefit from a uniform tenure and reduce effective interest rate, according to the filing.
The company said loan consolidation under a consortium financing arrangement comprising eight lenders became possible with the amalgamation of the six SPVs after the credit rating of Adani Power was enhanced to AA.

Adani Energy in talks with banks to borrow up to $600 million,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-energy-in-talks-with-banks-to-borrow-up-to-600-million/articleshow/108857506.cms,28-03-2024,"Adani Energy Solutions
Ltd. is seeking a
credit facility
for as much as $600 million to fund
smart meter projects
for
electricity supply
, according to people familiar with the matter.
The unit of India’s ports-to-power conglomerate is discussing the planned transaction with a group of
global lenders
, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. The foreign currency loan’s tenor could range from three to five years, with the pricing likely linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, they said.
An
Adani Group
representative did not offer any immediate comment.
Adani Energy Solutions in December agreed to form a venture with UAE-based
Esyasoft
to execute smart meter projects in India and overseas. The company secured
smart meter installation
orders worth 23 billion rupees ($276 million) in the quarter ended December, and added 302 circuit kilometers of transmission networks, according a filing earlier this year.
India plans to roll out 250 million smart meters across the country, and the plan has also attracted investments from companies including Schneider Electric SE and Electricite de France SA. The devices represent a tool for India’s power-distribution companies to address billing inefficiencies that have contributed to losses and high debt burdens.

The people cited above said the platform will invest about $1 billion of additional equity in the future to increase the assets under management to over ₹30,000 crore.
Sterlite Power would transfer four operational assets with a cumulative project cost of about ₹7,500 crores into this JV, pursuant to closure of the deal. Two assets are located in Rajasthan, and one each in Assam and Kashmir. These
transmission corridors
will be designed to evacuate 1,000-2,000 MW.
Agarwal said the transmission sector has the most robust pipeline compared to other sectors, including renewables.
India is targeting to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy by over 45% by the end of this decade and also achieve 50% of its cumulative electric power from renewables by 2030. To attain these goals, the
national transmission grid
needs to be significantly upgraded to support the widespread adoption of
renewable energy
.

Competition Commission of India
on Tuesday approved
Adani Power

Adani Power proposes to acquire a 100% stake and control of bankrupt Lanco Amarkantak following a

“The proposed transaction does not result in an appreciable adverse effect on competition in any plausible relevant market in India. Accordingly, the definition of the relevant market may be left open,” the CCI said.
The acquisition of Lanco Amarkantak, which has two units of 300 megawatt of thermal power each in
Chhattisgarh

It had sent e-mails to both - ICICI Bank and Axis Bank -requesting them to accept the OTS amount along with 12 per cent interest.
However, ICICI Bank did not respond whereas Axis Bank vide its e-mail dated March 11, 2024, communicated that OTS has come to an end and there is no question of permitting any deposit, submitted John Energy before NCLAT.
Counsel representing John Energy submitted that the company is ready to deposit the entire OTS amount which was earlier arrived along with 12 per cent interest in the court to show his bonafide.
It further submitted that the contract of thousands of crore which are with the company shall automatically be terminated due to the clause in the contract if insolvency commences.
This was opposed by the counsel for the ICICI Bank and Axis Bank said the offer was not acceptable.
The OTS which earlier arrived has come to an end since John Energy failed to deposit the amount and the amount which was claimed by them in their section 7 application (for insolvency) is much more than that.
On this NCLAT said:""We are of the view that since the Section 7 application is pending before the Adjudicating Authority, it is for the Adjudicating Authority to take a call on the submissions and offer made by the Appellant.
""However, in the ends of justice, we are of the view that the Appellant and the investors as submitted before the Court may deposit the amount of Rs 167 crore along with 12 per cent interest and Rs 87 crore plus 12 per cent interest before the NCLT within 10 days as prayed by way of FDR in favour of Registrar, NCLT,"" the NCLAT order said.

Separately, Reliance Infrastructure stated its total financial indebtedness was Rs 4,233 crore for the same period. In April 2023, Reliance Power settled loans with two lenders - JC Flowers ARC and
Canara Bank
- according to exchange disclosures.
Reliance Power had allotted 200 million equity shares to VFSI Holdings in September 2022 at Rs 15.55 per share; of this, 25% was subscribed at Rs 80 crore then, while the remaining were issued as warrants. VFSI exercised the right to convert warrants into shares resulting in an infusion of Rs240 crore.
In August this year, Reliance Commercial Finance, which
Authum Investment
& Infrastructure acquired, invested Rs 1,043 crore in both the Reliance companies. It invested Rs 891 crore in Reliance Infrastructure and Rs 152 crore in Reliance Power.

said on Tuesday it is aware of a U.S. investigation into potential violations of anti-corruption laws by a ""third party"", but denied any relationship with the entity.
Adani's comment comes days after

whether an Adani entity or individuals linked to the company, including founder
Gautam Adani

"Lenders to sell Wind World (India) debt to NARCL, recover 18% dues",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/lenders-to-sell-wind-world-india-debt-to-narcl-recover-18-dues/articleshow/108603627.cms,19-03-2024,"The government-backed
National Asset Reconstruction Company
(
NARCL
) is declared the winning bidder for a majority debt of
Wind World
(India) following an uncontested Swiss challenge
auction
held by lenders on Monday, said people with knowledge of the matter.
NARCL gave a binding offer of Rs 670 crore to acquire Rs 3763 crore debt from lenders, according to a sale notice that did not name the
ARC
.
The offer from NARCL—which is a 15:85 structure—equated to an 18% recovery from lenders. Under the structure, 15% of the consideration is cash, and the balance is in the form of security receipts (SR) payable on loan recovery.
Omkara ARC
, which had earlier offered Rs 550 crore upfront cash, did not bid, the people cited above said. However, the two offers are not strictly comparable since NARCL's offer is only for 79% debt and in combination of cash and SR, while Omkara's offer was in cash and for the entire debt.
JC Flowers ARC, too, was evaluating the company, but it did not submit a bid, the people said.

IDBI Bank
,
State Bank of India
,
Punjab National Bank
,
Canara Bank
,
Bank of Baroda
, Bank of India, Central
Bank of India
and
Axis Bank
are among the lenders that would sell their loans to NARCL.
Lenders admitted Wind World (India) for corporate insolvency in 2018, but a series of litigation and limited progress in debt resolution during the lockdown due to Covid-19 delayed the resolution process.
A consortium led by Suraksha ARC,
Suraksha Realty and Lakshdeep Investments
, which had emerged as the winning bidder, withdrew their offer, a move that was challenged by the lenders even as the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the withdrawal of the offer.
Shailen Shah, the company's resolution professional, has admitted Rs 6,147 crore claims, of which Rs 4,530 crore are from secured lenders.
State Bank of India filed the highest claim of Rs 1,209 crore, followed by IDBI Bank of Rs 1,119 crore.
According to media reports, a dispute between joint venture partners Germany's
Enercon
GmbH and the Yogesh and Ajay Mehra brothers of Wind World (India) resulted in a financial crisis in the company.
While the Mehra brothers alleged that Enercon was attempting to take over the company, Enercon claimed that the Mehras had siphoned off money from the company.

"SC rejects Adani Power's plea to recover Rs 1,376 crore from Rajasthan discom",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sc-dismisses-adani-powers-plea-seeking-late-payment-surcharge-imposes-fine-of-rs-50000/articleshow/108594408.cms,18-03-2024,"The
Supreme Court
on Monday dismissed a miscellaneous application filed by
Adani
Power Rajasthan seeking to recover Rs 1376 crore on account of
late payment surcharge
from Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam.
While imposing a fine of Rs 50,000 on Adani Power for effectively seeking review of the case through a miscellaneous application seeking clarification, a Bench comprising justices Anirudhha Bose and Sanjay Kumar said a miscellaneous application was not the proper legal course when seeking a review.
The apex court also said it does not retain jurisdiction to entertain an application after the appeal was disposed of by a three-judge Bench on August 31, 2020. “This is not an application for correcting any clerical or arithmetical error. Neither it is an application for extension of time. A post disposal application for modification and clarification of the order of disposal shall lie only in rare cases, where the order passed by this court is executory in nature and the directions of the court may become impossible to be implemented because of subsequent events or developments. The factual background of this application does not fit into that description,” the judgment stated.
In 2020, the
SC
had held that Adani Power was entitled to a compensatory tariff but not to a late payment
surcharge
in a power purchase agreement with the state discom. Following this, Adani Power Rajasthan in 2020 filed an application seeking late payment surcharge of Rs 1376 crore from Jaipur Vidyut.
The Monday’s judgment noted that the Adani’s counsel had expressed his desire to withdraw the application in January, but the SC did not agree. “Any plaintiff would be entitled to abandon a suit or abandon part of the claim made in the suit at any time after institution of the suit, as provided in Rule 1 of Order XXIII of the Code. We, however, decided not to permit such simpliciter withdrawal, as the Rajasthan discoms sought imposition of costs...Even if an applicant applies for withdrawal of an application, in exceptional cases, it would be within the jurisdiction of the court to examine the application and pass appropriate orders,” it said.

""A relief of this nature cannot be asked for in a miscellaneous application which was described in the course of hearing as an application for clarification,"" Justice Bose said.
""The maintainability of the present application cannot be explained by invoking the inherent power of this court either. The applicant has not applied for review of the main judgment. In the contempt action, it failed to establish any willful disobedience of the main judgment and order on account of non-payment of LPS,"" the bench said.
""Now the applicant cannot continue to hitchhike on the same judgment by relying on the inherent power or jurisdiction of this court,"" it added.
Writing the 23-page judgement for the bench, Justice Bose said, ""We, accordingly, dismiss the present application. This application was listed before us on several occasions and for that reason, we impose costs of Rs 50,000 to be paid by the applicant to be remitted to the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.""

The top court had on January 24 reserved its judgement.
The Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (
JVVNL
), represented by senior advocate Dushyant Dave, had vehemently opposed the plea of Adani Power seeking over Rs 1,300 crore as LPS from the state discom.
The court, which had not permitted the Adani firm to withdraw its plea on January 24, gave reasons for that in its detailed judgment.
The APRL, through its miscellaneous application in a decided case, had sought a direction to the state firm to make a payment of Rs 1,376.35 crore towards LPS.
The claim was raised by the Adani firm citing a term of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) entered by it with the state discom on January 28, 2010.
Under the agreement, the APRL was to supply electricity to the Rajasthan discoms and to generate the electricity, the Adani firm had to procure coal from Indonesia.
The 2010 PPA had postulated domestic coal as the primary source of energy, while imported coal was to be used as a backup option.
The APRL's complaint was that due to the non-availability of sufficient domestic coal, it could not be allocated a domestic coal linkage by the Centre and that it was compelled to rely on imported coal from Indonesia that came at a higher cost.
As per the Adani firm, it was one of the main reasons for seeking LPS. However, this matter was decided by the apex court and the firm filed an interim application on this issue in the case.
The bench did not permit the withdrawal as it was also opposed by the Rajasthan government discom.
""In our opinion, the provision which pertains to a suit would not ipso facto apply to a miscellaneous application invoking inherent powers of this court, instituted in a set of statutory appeals which stood disposed of. Even if an applicant applies for withdrawal of an application, in exceptional cases, it would be within the jurisdiction of the court to examine the application and pass appropriate orders.
""So far as the present proceeding is concerned, an important question of law has arisen as regards jurisdiction of the court to entertain an application taken out in connection with a set of statutory appeals which stood disposed of,"" it said.
The judgment said it was necessary to spell out the position of law as to when such post-disposal miscellaneous applications can be entertained after a matter is disposed of.
""This court has become functus-officio and does not retain jurisdiction to entertain an application after the appeal was disposed of by the judgment of a three-judge bench of this court on August 31, 2020, through a course beyond that specified in the statute. This is not an application for correcting any clerical or arithmetical error.
""Neither it is an application for extension of time. A post disposal application for modification and clarification of the order of disposal shall lie only in rare cases, where the order passed by this court is executory in nature and the directions of the court may become impossible to be implemented because of subsequent events or developments. The factual background of this application does not fit into that description,"" it said.
The Adani firm's plea before the bench was in the news after the apex court had pulled up its registry for not listing the case for unspecified reasons despite a judicial order to post it.
The Adani firm was seeking modification of a three-judge bench verdict delivered on August 30, 2020, on the plea of JVVNL through a miscellaneous application which is filed in pending cases.
The top court, in its 2020 verdict, had upheld the orders of the
Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission
and the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, observing that the Adani firm was entitled to a compensatory tariff but not to the LPS as claimed.

March
13 as temperatures rose across the country, much higher than the 206.8 GW on the corresponding day last year. It also surpassed the 209-GW level recorded a year back in the same month.
The peak demand so far in the month, is however, lower than that estimated by the
power ministry
at 231 GW for the ongoing month.
""From next week, this demand will pick up,"" a government official told ET. ""March 18 onwards
temperature
is expected to rise which is when we expect higher peak demand,"" the person said.
This is a transition period when the northern region temperature is just beginning to pick up, the person said, adding that demand in the western and southern parts of the country is already high. Prior to this, peak demand had reached 222 GW on February 17 and February 23, owing to winter demand.
Unlike other years, peak demand in the ongoing financial year touched record highs in August and September. The deviation was mainly because of the lower average temperature between March and May and a deficient monsoon which saw higher demand in August, September, and parts of October.

"India, Russia in discussions on thermonuclear research, transit potential of North sea: Rosatom CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-russia-in-discussions-on-thermonuclear-research-transit-potential-of-north-sea-rosatom-ceo/articleshow/108423391.cms,12-03-2024,"India and Russia are in discussions to collaborate on a range of activities including research on controlled thermonuclear fusion and joint development of the transit potential of the Northern Sea route, a top official of the state-run atomic energy corporation in Moscow,
Rosatom
, has said.
A E Likhacheva
, CEO of Rosatom said the main topic of discussion with India was on the prospects of further cooperation in the field of nuclear technologies and in non-energy and non-nuclear areas.
Likhacheva, who visited the Kudankulam
Nuclear Power
Plant (KNPP) in Tamil Nadu last month, said both sides have gained enormous experience in cooperation during the construction of KNPP's first units.
""Already, our cooperation extends beyond the borders of India. Indian companies are participating in Rosatom's project to build the first nuclear power plant in Bangladesh - Rooppur NPP,"" he told PTI in an email interview.
Additionally, Rosatom was developing a considerable number of new areas of activity --about 80 of them--and in many of them it was ready to share its developments with friendly countries.
Live Events
""Thus, we can offer the Indian side our competencies in the construction of low-power nuclear power plants,"" he said.
He was of the view that both countries have great potential for cooperation in scientific research, including on the topic of controlled thermonuclear fusion.
Likacheva said Rosatom was also ready to provide Indian scientists, the opportunity to conduct research at the MBIR multi-purpose fast neutron research reactor currently under construction in Russia.
""This will be the most powerful research reactor in the world, it will open up unique opportunities for conducting a wide range of work on medical topics, research in the field of fundamental and applied physics, as well as in the interests of creating new materials,"" he said.
Besides that, Russia is also in discussions with India on the joint development of the transit potential of the Northern Sea Route, which is operated by Rosatom.
This will help ensure supplies of Russian oil, coal and liquefied natural gas to India via the said route, with transshipment in Russian Far Eastern ports.
""We are also exploring options for cooperation within the framework of the Euro-Asian Container Transit project. This project involves the organization of a pilot line for international container transit through the Northern Sea Route. As you can see, the range of areas for mutually beneficial cooperation is very wide, and I am confident we will still make a significant contribution to the development of the strategic partnership of our countries,"" he said.
Regarding India's long-term energy strategy and goals, the
Rosatom CEO
said that the company plans to have a cumulative installed capacity share of non-fossil fuel energy sources of around 50 per cent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Nuclear energy would play a significant role in attaining those goals.
He said India already ranks second after China in terms of the number of nuclear power units under construction simultaneously.
The construction of KNPP is a flagship project of Indo-Russian cooperation and it is being built according to a modern generation 3+ design with VVER-1000 reactors, he said.
""This is the largest nuclear power plant in India. Operating just one 1,000 MW unit prevents on average more than 3 million tons of CO2 emissions annually.""
""... the operation of the first two units has already prevented emissions of more than 47 million tons of CO2 equivalent. This means that in addition to providing the south of India with the necessary electricity, the nuclear power plant is already helping to improve the environmental situation in the region,"" Likhacheva said.
He said Unit 1 and 2 of the NPP were operating stably and in compliance with all safety conditions.
""The construction of the second stage (blocks 3 and 4) and the third stage (blocks 5 and 6) is actively underway. The construction process of the nuclear power plant is in full swing. Let me remind you, the Russian side's area of responsibility includes design, supply of main and auxiliary equipment, installation supervision and personnel training. We fulfill all our obligations in full,"" he said.
Likhacheva also said Rosatom has already delivered the first batches of the new type of fuel assemblies, TVS-2M, with an increased nuclear fuel load, to the power plant in June 2022.
""Operating on longer fuel cycles increases the economic efficiency of a nuclear plant, since the unit is shut down less frequently for scheduled maintenance. This increases the utilization factor of the installed capacity of the nuclear power plant, that is, it allows the nuclear plant to produce more electricity during the calendar year,"" he said.
The second unit of KNPP will get the first batch of the new fuel assemblies in the summer of 2024, he added.
Likhacheva said nuclear energy certainly plays an important role in the fight against climate change and its share in the global energy balance needs to be increased, because it has undeniable advantages compared to other low-carbon energy sources.
Nuclear energy has one feature that greatly distinguishes it from other types of generation--cost.
""The high level of costs at the construction stage is offset by a very long - currently up to 80 years - service life, during which the cost of electricity production is constantly decreasing,"" he said.
Therefore, nuclear energy is rightfully considered one of the most affordable and most efficient types of electricity generation, he added.
The Rosatom CEO further said Russian nuclear power units fully comply with all the requirements for modern nuclear energy.
""This is evidenced by the global demand for nuclear power plants of Russian design. Today, Rosatom projects account for 88 per cent of the exported construction of nuclear power in the world,"" he said.

Gencos and gear makers to be nudged by the govt to join hands for EPC bids,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/gencos-and-gear-makers-to-be-nudged-by-the-govt-to-join-hands-for-epc-bids/articleshow/108308570.cms,07-03-2024,"New Delhi: Muted response to thermal engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) bids has prompted the government to encourage consortia of companies to bid for upcoming contracts for supply of
thermal power equipment
.
The move comes in light of state-owned Bharat
Heavy Electricals Ltd
(
BHEL
) emerging as the winner of three consecutive large contracts to set up power plants.
Measures on the table include forming consortia of parts and service providers or splitting
tender packages
for specific works. Under the EPC model, all project phases are usually completed by a single company under one contract. The
power ministry
had called a meeting with stakeholders to discuss factors leading to lukewarm response by
equipment manufacturers
to tenders floated by power plants, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that the options of forming a consortia and splitting the tender were also discussed. State-owned
NTPC
may effect changes to qualifying requirements in its tenders, if needed to increase partcipation from the companies, people familiar with the matter said.
""NTPC is exploring all options to increase participation like EPC consortium route, split package options etc., to ensure that targeted
thermal capacity addition
is done at optimum cost and within a specified timeline,"" an
NTPC
official aware of the plan told ET. Larsen & Toubro, according to another person, had not participated in some recent tenders floated by thermal power plants. ""BHEL's bids have brought down the cost for setting up thermal power projects. Since three consecutive tenders have been awarded at this price, it may be viewed as a benchmark for future projects,"" a second person aware of the bids placed by BHEL said. ""NTPC is also in talks with L&T over the issues faced by the company in these tenders,"" another official, who was part of this meeting, said. Other thermal products providers that attended the meeting, included
Thermax
, Toshiba and GE. The companies did not respond to queries sent by ET till press time. State-owned DVC's tenders for 2X660 MW Raghunathpur Phase-II and 2X800 MW at Koderma Phase-II, that have been issued, will be keenly eyed by the sector as last date for the bids are March 14 and March 19, respectively.

Power units will end financial year with 45 million tonnes of fuel: Coal minister Pralhad Joshi,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-units-will-end-financial-year-with-45-million-tonnes-of-fuel-coal-minister-pralhad-joshi/articleshow/108308428.cms,07-03-2024,"New Delhi:
Coal minister Pralhad Joshi
on Thursday said
power plants
will end the
financial year
with 45 million tonnes of fuel, much higher than last year's 37 million tonnes, which included imported stock. The projection is higher than the ministry's earlier projection of around 40 million tonnes as closing stock at plants. The
overall coal stock
, including
fuel
in transit and at pitheads, is expected to be at 150 million tonnes as on March 31, he said. Last year, the total stock as of March end was 125.5 million tonnes.
The stocks will support the demand in the summer season, when the peak consumption is expected to rise to 250-260 GW compared with this year's 243 GW.
The cumulative
coal
production up to February was 880.72 million tonnes in the current financial year as compared to 785.39 million tonnes in the same period last year, a growth of 12%. Joshi reiterated that coal import is reducing as domestic fuel availability is on the rise and the aim is to completely end thermal fuel import. To that effect, the government has constituted an inter-ministerial committee for the purpose of import substitution of coal by 2030.

""We have put in place policy instruments such as a tariff barrier of 40% on modules and 25% on cells so that industry is protected. The module manufacturing capacity in India has gone up to 50 GW from 20 GW, and cell manufacturing capacity to around 12 -13 GW from 2 GW,"" he said.
India has added 200,000 circuit km transmission lines in the last decade making it the largest such integrated system in the world, he added.
Power demand has grown by 60% from FY14, and grew by 9% last year, but we were able to meet it due to the expansion and upgradation in infrastructure, he said. He added that the Indian industry needs to look around to compete in external markets and be able to export.
On viability of projects in the sector, he said there were about 60 GW of projects under
National Company Law Tribunal
. However, currently, the m-cap of the companies in the sector has risen 3-4 times, indicating their viability, he said.

Tata Power consumers to pay more as MERC approves 24% hike,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/tata-power-consumers-to-pay-more-as-merc-approves-24-hike/articleshow/108305043.cms,07-03-2024,"Come April,
Tata Power
consumers will have to pay more for
electricity
.
On Thursday, the
Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission
approved an average
tariff
rise of about 24% for
Tata Power
for the fiscal year 2024-25, effective from 1 April, 2024.
In its order,
MERC
said that the present tariff
hike
is necessitated mainly because there was under-recovery due to staying on tariff as determined in the MTR Order for FY 2023-24. ""Had there been no stay, tariff for FY 2024-25 would have resulted in tariff decrease of 13% than approved by the Commission in MTR Order for FY 2024-25.""
Tata Power Spokesperson said that MERC determined the revised tariff of TPC-D for FY 2024-25, resulting in an overall increase due to past approved gaps up to FY 2023-24, to be recovered within FY 2024-25 and remaining within a range of +/- 20% of the average cost of supply.
""Despite this, our Residential Tariff for the 0-100 category remains the lowest, while the 101-300 category is only slightly higher than other private players,"" a company spokesperson said.

private sector
in nuclear energy as India eyes an increase in generation capacity to meet surging demand. In an interview, Union power minister
RK Singh
also said his ministry had initiated discussions with equipment manufacturers to support
thermal capacity
creation.
""I think we have to consider getting in private sector (in
nuclear power
). We should allow it with safeguards because in other countries, the private sector is doing it,"" he said.
India's nuclear power generating capacity is at 6,780 MW. ""We have thought we need to add nuclear capacity at a fast pace,"" the minister said.
He said the government is looking to bolster capacity generation to meet rising demand. If needed, the current target of 85,000 MW of thermal capacity addition can be exceeded. For
hydro power
, the target is to double capacity from the current 46,000 MW.

""Peak demand was 130,000-140,000 MW in 2013, whereas today it is 243,000 MW and will reach 370,000 MW (by) 2030,"" Singh said, illustrating why more capacity is needed.
Generation, transmission and distribution capacity is being increased, he said, adding that substantial reforms have been made in a multi-pronged approach to address issues in all these areas.
While India is committed to raising non-fossil fuel-based capacities, it won't compromise on availability of power for expansion, the minister said.
""The Indian economy is growing, so we have to add capacity to support it,"" Singh said. ""Renewable energy is not round the clock. We need round-the-clock electricity and storage is expensive.""
The power sector needs grid-scale battery energy storage systems and
pumped hydro storage projects
. These are likely to reduce the price of storage, Singh said. Around 4,000 MW of pumped storage projects are under construction and about 35,000 MW are in the process of being cleared, he said. Once the storage projects materialise, thermal capacity addition can stop, he said.
Thermal equipment
With energy transition on the horizon, manufacturers of boilers, turbines, and other equipment for thermal plants had lowered production. Now the government wants them to support capacity creation.
State-owned
BHEL
is increasing its capacity and the government wants private companies to do the same, he said.
""We called a meeting with equipment manufacturers and asked them to support the plan... So they are starting to increase now,"" the minister said.
Rooftop solar
Singh said he was confident of achieving the target to solarise 10 million rooftops under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana. Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
had announced the Rs 75,000 crore scheme on January 22. India has sufficient capacity to deliver the equipment required for the rooftop solar installations, Singh said.
The domestic manufacturing capacity of modules is around 50 GW, of which around 24 GW has been installed and another 25 GW is near completion, he said. Cell manufacturing capacity is also close to going up to 20-25 GW.
""We are mobilising the entire value chain and system in the sector, including urban local bodies and rural panchayats, for the scheme,"" he said.
Renewable target
The target of 500 GW by 2030 will be achieved, Singh said, adding that the country had 173 GW of renewable energy capacity, excluding nuclear, and 103 GW under construction. He said the remaining 224 GW will be in addition to green hydrogen and green ammonia.
On whether there is a need to rethink restrictions on Chinese imports, Singh said substantial domestic capacity is being set up that will cater to the requirement of renewable capacity additions. He pointed out that there were no such restrictions so far as open access was concerned.
Summer demand
The peak demand is expected to go to 260 GW between April and June in the coming summer season, Singh said, asserting that the government is well prepared to handle the situation. A preparatory meeting was held with the coal and railway ministries on coping with the anticipated rise in demand, Singh said.

PM Surya Ghar
Muft Bijlee Yojana on February 13. Shilpa Samant explains the nuts and bolts of the scheme:
What is the
PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana
?
It is a scheme that aims to provide free electricity to households who opt to install rooftop solar electricity units. The households will be able to get 300 units of electricity free every month. The scheme focuses on the household segment with up to 3 kW system, which covers most of the residential consumers in India.
What is the amount of subsidy for households?
A subsidy of 60% of the cost for systems up to 2 kW capacity and 40% of cost for systems between 2-3 kW has been announced. The subsidy has been capped at 3 kW capacity, which means financial support will not be provided for capacity beyond 3 kW.
At current benchmark prices, Rs 30,000 subsidy will be provided for 1 kW system, Rs 60,000 for 2 kW systems and Rs 78,000 for 3 kW systems or higher.
How can you get the system installed?
Any resident with a roof suitable for installing solar panels can apply by first registering on the national rooftop solar portal. The consumer can choose a vendor from the list provided on the portal. The vendors are registered with the distribution companies, but in future there could be a national registry as well. A valid electricity connection is required for it and the household must not have availed any other subsidy for solar panels.

What happens to the cost of system installation beyond subsidy?
For the amount to be paid till the subsidy gets credited, households can access collateral-free low-interest loans.
If a consumer is unable to bear the upfront cost required to pay the vendor at the start of the installation, which is needed till the subsidy gets credited, he or she can pay 10% upfront, for instance, and take a loan for the remaining 90% at 7% interest rate. Once the central subsidy is released as the system is commissioned, it gets adjusted with the loan amount and the remaining 30% gets repaid in a 10-year tenure in monthly instalments.
Multiple banks will be available to give loans at around 7% at present rate for up to 3 kW. The interest rate has been pegged at 0.5% above the prevailing repo rate at a given time. In the event of the repo rate, currently at 6.5%, getting reduced to, say, 5.5%, the effective interest rate for consumers will drop to 6%.
What is the cost to the government and how will public sector enterprises help?
The government has announced a central financing of Rs 75,021 crore, which will mostly be given as a direct subsidy to the consumer. The scheme provides a component for payment security for renewable energy service company-based models as well as a fund for innovative projects. Public sector enterprises are expected to step in if the response is slow in certain areas or clusters despite the subsidy. State-run power companies are likely to invest in solar rooftop systems and collect revenue from the surplus power sold in the grid.

Continue blending of 6 pc imported coal till June: Power Min to power plants,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/continue-blending-of-6-pc-imported-coal-till-june-power-min-to-power-plants/articleshow/108243673.cms,05-03-2024,"The
power ministry
has asked domestic coal-based
thermal power plants
to continue blending six per cent of
imported coal
until June 2024 amid the projection of an all-time high peak power demand of 250 GW in summer. In a direction issued in October 2023, the power ministry had asked all thermal power plants to continue blending imported coal in view of supply issues and rising demand for
electricity
till March 2024 and also increase the blending proportion of imported coal from four per cent to six per cent in domestic fuel.
In a similar direction issued to power plants on Monday, the ministry noted that the peak power demand is likely to touch 250 GW in the summer season (April to June 2024).
The ministry has also observed that despite the increase in the loading of domestic coal rakes, the supplies of dry fuel will remain constrained due to various logistics issues associated with the railway network.
The ministry pointed out that in order to meet the power demand in crucial summer months and ensure uninterrupted power supply across the country, adequate
coal reserves
in domestic coal-based plants (DCB) should be maintained by all Central/State GENCOS and IPPs (independent power producers).
""The Ministry of Power, therefore, decided to extend the advisory date October 25, 2023, till June 2024,"" it stated.
Live Events
The power ministry on September 1, 2023, issued an advisory for 4 per cent blending of imported coal by weight by DCB plants till March 2024.
But, later it found that there was a gap of 12 million tonnes between coal supplies and consumption from September 1 to October 9, 2023.
Thereafter, the ministry issued an advisory to increase the blending of imported coal to six per cent on October 25, 2023.
During 2023, the peak power demand had touched a time high of 243 GW in September.
Earlier on Monday, a senior official had projected 260GW peak power demand during this summer season.

power
producers to import 6% of their
coal
requirements until June, despite adequate domestic availability, amid transport constraints and higher electricity demand, a power ministry note said on Tuesday.
India
last year had asked utilities to import 6% of their coal requirements until March due to an unprecedented surge in power and coal demand.
Despite record production by state-run
Coal India
, which accounts for about 80% of India's domestic production of the fuel, constraints with the country's railway network necessitated imports, the note said.
The ministry estimated peak power demand to reach upto 250 GW in summer (April-June 2024), 3% higher than the record 243 GW in September last year.
Coal accounts for about 75% of India's power generation, with coal-fired plants accounting for more than three quarters of India's use of the polluting fuel.

Indian firms look to bet big on coal-fired power after long absence,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-jsw-among-indian-firms-look-to-bet-big-on-coal-fired-power-after-long-absence/articleshow/108230597.cms,05-03-2024,"Private Indian firms have expressed interest in building at least 10 gigawatts (GW) of
coal-fired power
capacity over a decade, four sources familiar with the matter said, ending a six-year drought in significant private involvement in the sector.
Adani Power
,
JSW Group
and
Essar Power
are among the companies that have told India's
power ministry
they would be keen to expand old plants or develop stalled projects facing financial stress, according to the sources and a government presentation seen by Reuters.
The potential investments, which have not been previously reported, could cumulatively cost billions of dollars and demonstrate renewed appetite in an industry seen by many as financially unattractive. But they also threaten to undermine progress made by the world's No.3 greenhouse gas emitter in weaning its economy off carbon.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has cited energy security concerns and low per-capita emissions to defend India's coal dependence, has been trying to attract private investment to boost its coal-fired capacity by 80 GW by 2032.
Coal-fired power plants currently account for half, or about 215 GW of India's total installed capacity of 430 GW, with renewables accounting for 135 GW and hydro making up 47 GW.

A spokesperson for the power ministry said the private sector had agreed to invest in the coal-fired power sector ""in line with the energy requirements of the nation,"" adding that India was ahead of international commitments to cut emissions.
""The private sector is now expressing interest because of financial viability and assurance that payments will be made on time,"" he said.
The companies did not respond to requests seeking comment.
India's Association of Power Producers (APP), which represents coal-fired power developers, told Power Minister R K Singh its members were eager to boost capacity, according to a Dec 4 letter reviewed by Reuters.
Among the new proposals, Adani Power plans to add 4.8 GW and JSW 1 GW, according to three sources and a government presentation dated Nov 21 reviewed by Reuters.
Essar Power plans 1.6 GW of new domestic coal-based power generation in Gujarat state by 2029, one of the sources said. Another source said
Vedanta
will add 1.9 GW of capacity.
The sources - two government officials and two industry executives - declined to be named as the discussions are not public.
The presentation, made by an arm of the power ministry in November, estimates that the plants would be commissioned by 2032.
PRIVATE FUNDING DROUGHT
In the five years to March 2018, private sector investments drove 56 GW, or over 60% of new coal-fired power, government data shows. That dwindled to 1.5 GW, or 5% of additions, in the next five years as projects faced financial stress, shifting the investment burden onto state and federal governments.
A total of 24 private sector projects totalling over 23 GW, or over 10% of current Indian coal-fired capacity, are on hold or unlikely to be commissioned due to financial stress, according to power ministry data.
However, higher coal dependence in the last three years due to slower renewable installations, heavy power demand, and new emergency laws enabling higher tariffs have made coal-fired power attractive again, boosting profits and pushing shares of generators to record highs.
APP asked the government to provide more flexibility in coal and power supply agreements and expansion of existing power plants, ease clearances, and ensure domestic credit availability to expedite investments.
""It will be a big challenge for any private developer to raise funds,"" APP wrote in the Dec 4 letter, adding that state lenders Power Finance Corp (PFC) and
Rural Electrification Corp
(
REC
) should be asked to take the lead.
PFC and REC did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
A senior REC executive said it was keen to fund the planned additions with 70% debt as long as lending requirements are met.
""REC has made significant progress in reducing non-performing assets and we would like to keep it that way,"" the executive told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter was not public.

to
consumers
and meet the growing

. The Government of India has amended the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules of 2022 which will enhance the reliability of
power supply
for all consumers, a power ministry statement said.
Union Minister for Power and New &
Renewable Energy
R K Singh said that a key amendment which has been made is related to surplus power which is within the declared generation capacity but not requisitioned by distribution companies.
The minister said that some
power generators
were not offering this surplus power in the market, thus resulting in unused power capacity at the national level.
To address this issue and optimize the use of available power, power generators that do not offer their surplus power will now not be eligible to claim capacity or fixed charges corresponding to that surplus quantum.
Additionally, this surplus power cannot be offered for sale in the power exchange, at a price of more than 120 per cent of energy charge plus applicable transmission charge.

This will increase the likelihood of the surplus electricity getting purchased and utilized.
Furthermore, amendments have been made to align the Rules with statutory provisions related to accessing the national power grid.
These amendments facilitate distribution companies facing curtailment of access due to payment defaults, in getting quicker restoration of access to the national grid once they settle their outstanding dues.

"Don't allow manual entry of bids, power regulator tells exchanges",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/dont-allow-manual-entry-of-bids-power-regulator-tells-exchanges/articleshow/107892616.cms,22-02-2024,"The
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
has directed
power exchanges
to not allow any
manual entry
of
bids
on behalf of their members within or after
trading hours
. It has also ordered exchanges to not accept any bids after the trading hours.
India has three power exchanges – India Energy Exchange (IEX), Hindustan Power Exchange (HPX) and Power Exchange India (PXI).
Taking a suo motu cognizance, it has ordered an audit of the processes as well as the software of the three power exchanges to review their operations for complying with the provisions of the
Power Market Regulations
2021.
No extension in the trading hours will be allowed, except in case of any constraint identified by the
system operator
, the power sector
regulator
said.
The power exchanges can no longer entertain any request for cancellation of a bid post trading hours of a member in any of the collective market segments. To that extent, the commission reversed its own order dated October 2018, wherein it had allowed a limit of five times a year to a member for the cancellation of bids post trading hours.
Live Events
""CERC seeks to strike a balance between flexibility in operations of the power exchanges and probity of the bid process by standardising
operations of the exchanges within the trading hours incorporating technology and data encryption. This should bring robustness in the power market operations,"" Amit Kapur, Joint Managing Partner, JSA Advocates & Solicitors told ET.
As per the regulator’s order, power exchanges will have to build a robust system with end-to-end encryption of data from the trading workstation of the respective member or clients and the trading platform of the power exchange to ensure the trail of the bidding session is encrypted.
“It is important that the power exchanges remain robust, neutral and transparent at all times in their management and operation and inspire confidence in market participants,” the commission said.
""Over the years, CERC has worked towards bringing transparency and building strong frameworks for the exchanges and this order is another step in that direction, which will bring more transparency, further strengthen regulatory practices and lead to continuous improvement in the functioning of the exchanges,"" Rohit Bajaj, Executive Director - Business Development,Strategy and Regulatory Affairs at IEX said.
The observations
On preliminary scrutiny of the Market Surveillance Committee report, which is submitted to the commission quarterly, the regulator observed a few instances of manual entry of bids, cancellation of bids after the market hours, entry of bids after the market hours, and extension of market hours, etc.
After reports observed from the first quarter of 2019-20 to the third quarter of 2023-24, it was observed that while the instances of such assistance were few initially, there has been an increasing trend of such instances in the recent past, especially in FY23, the regulator said.
Notably, some of the major buyer and seller members of these exchanges have repeatedly had their bids manually entered through their respective power exchanges, it said.
The commission said that accommodating members’ requests to enter bids on their behalf can provide a potential breeding ground for market manipulation.
It was also against the basic principle of anonymity and transparency of the collective transactions, it noted.
The commission said it finds some of the reasons submitted by one of the exchanges like bids placed during non-office hours and unavailability of manpower on a round-the-clock basis, as not covered under the reasons specified in the business rules of the said exchange and hence unwarranted. The commission did not specify the exchange in this context.
With the rapid advancement in information technology, the members can eliminate such issues through IT integration and automation in the bid submission process, it said.
Further, the market participants have achieved a level of maturity over the last 15 years of operation of the power exchanges in India. The market participants are expected to pay more attention while placing their bids rather than relying on the power exchanges to correct their bids, it said.

"Torrent Power, Lanco emerge as lowest bidders in gas-fired power auction",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/torrent-power-lanco-emerge-as-lowest-bidders-in-gas-fired-power-auction/articleshow/107883033.cms,21-02-2024,"India's
Torrent Power
and
Lanco Group
were among the companies emerging as the lowest bidders in an auction to supply natural gas-fired power during periods of unusually high
electricity
use, a document reviewed by Reuters showed.
India relies on coal to generate about three-quarters of its electricity, and power generated from coal is typically much cheaper than that generated by gas-fired plants. Over half of the country's roughly 25 gigawatts (GW) of gas-fired capacity is non-operational.
However, fears of power shortages while Prime Minister Narendra Modi stands for election this year have pushed the world's fifth-largest economy to turn to gas-fired power.
India's daily electricity demand is predicted to rise to a record 256.5 gigawatts (GW) in September 2024, up from the previous record of 243 GW in September last year, according to the Central Electricity Authority.
A unit of state-run generator
NTPC Ltd
issued the tender in January seeking 4,000 megawatts (MW) of gas-fired power, but bids were received for only 1,307 MW, the document from the unit, NTPC's power trading affiliate NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVM), showed.

"In a first, Centre taps private sector to invest Rs 2.16 lakh crore in nuclear energy",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/in-a-first-centre-taps-private-sector-to-invest-26-billion-in-nuclear-energy/articleshow/107861787.cms,21-02-2024,"The Centre will invite private companies to invest about $26 billion (₹2.16 lakh crore) in nuclear energy to increase the amount of electricity from sources that don't produce carbon dioxide emissions, said two government officials who are directly involved in the matter.
This is the first time the government is pursuing private investment in nuclear power, a non-carbon-emitting energy source that contributes less than 2% of India's total electricity generation. The funding would help
India
to achieve its target of having 50% of its installed electric generation capacity use non-fossil fuels by 2030, up from 42% now.
The government is in talks with at least five players - including
Reliance Industries
,
Tata Power
,
Adani Power and Vedanta Ltd
- to invest around ₹44,000 crore ($5.30 billion) each, the people cited said last week.
The
Department of Atomic Energy
and state-run
Nuclear Power Corp
of India (NPCIL) have held multiple rounds of discussions with the companies in the past year on the investment plan, they said. The Department of Atomic Energy,
NPCIL
, Tata Power, Reliance Industries,
Adani Power
and
Vedanta
did not respond to queries sent by Reuters.
With the investment, the government hopes to build 11,000 megawatts (MW) of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2040, said the people in the know, who did not want to be identified as the plan is still being finalised. NPCIL owns and operates India's nuclear power plants, with a capacity of 7,500 MW, and has committed investments for another 1,300 MW.

The people cited said the plan is for the companies to invest in the nuclear plants, acquire land and water, and undertake construction in areas outside the reactor complex. However, the rights to build and run the stations, as well as their fuel management, will rest with NPCIL, as allowed under the law, they added.
The companies are expected to earn revenue from the plant's electricity sales and NPCIL would operate the projects for a fee, they said. ""This hybrid model is an innovative solution to accelerate nuclear capacity,"" said
Charudatta Palekar
, an independent power sector consultant who formerly worked for PwC.
The plan will not require any amendment to the Atomic Energy Act, 1962.

Small Modular Reactor Nuclear Power Plants can fuel growth in India’s far-flung areas: Russian expert,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/small-modular-reactor-nuclear-power-plants-can-fuel-growth-in-indias-far-flung-areas-russian-expert/articleshow/107826754.cms,19-02-2024,"In certain parts of India, the construction of large
NPPs
is not economically justified, while in others, it is impossible due to territorial features and the lack of power grids. In such cases, what Rosatom, the State Atomic Energy Corporation, offers for
SMR NPPs
may turn out to be the only right solution, according to Dr Dmitrii Samokhin, Head of the Nuclear Physics and Engineering department, Obninsk Institute for Nuclear Power Engineering of the National Research Nuclear University.
Considering the list of sites in India for the potential placement of NPPs with a unit capacity of up to 300 MW, it becomes clear that there is a significant need, according to Samokhin. It may be pointed out that India and Russia are exploring SMRs as part of civil nuclear partnership
The RITM-200 series SMR NPP is a pressurized water reactor (
PWR
). Its modifications are designed for nuclear icebreakers, land-based and floating SMR NPPs. The RITM-200 reactor was designed based on the experience of operation of SMRon
Russian
nuclear icebreakers (more than 400 reactor-years). Currently, eight RITM200 reactors are installed on the newest nuclear icebreakers
Arktika
,
Sibir
,
Ural,
and
Yakutia
. Six of them have been in operation on three icebreakers since 2020 and 2022. The technology has proven its effectiveness and maximum safety at all stages of the life cycle, including radioactive waste management.
Safety systems are designed based on passive principles of operation, ensuring the safe state of the reactor for at least 72 hours in case of a loss of coolant accident in combination with total station blackout (as at Fukushima Daichi NPP in 2011). The SMR NPP design also provides protection from external natural (earthquakes, etc.) and man-made (commercial airplane crash) impacts.
Rosatom is developing the first land-based NPP and is currently building four floating nuclear power units based on RITM-200 technology. The land-based NPP with the RITM-200N reactor is designed to supply power to isolated power systems in remote areas. The NPP is distinguished by its compactness and modularity, short construction period and high safety standards. The construction of the station will ensure a stable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the development of the Kyuchus gold deposit, one of the largest in Russia. The commissioning of a small-scale NPP in Russia’s Ust-Kuiga settlement in Yakutia Region is planned in 2028, according to Samokhin.
Live Events
Safety, reliability, environmental friendliness - these absolute priorities of modern energy are reflected in the projects of SMR NPPs based on both the RITM-200N and the SHELF-M reactors, created by specialists of the Russian nuclear industry, pointed out Samokhin.

Athena Demwe bid: NCLAT rejects Navayuga Engineering Company's plea,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/athena-demwe-bid-nclat-rejects-navayuga-engineering-companys-plea/articleshow/107802135.cms,19-02-2024,"Mumbai: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
) has rejected an appeal filed by
Navayuga Engineering Company
Ltd, which had challenged the
lenders' decision
to disqualify it from bidding for the 1,750 MW Athena Demwe Power Ltd on the
Lohit river
in
Arunachal Pradesh
.
The
Lower Demwe hydroelectric project
, which is perceived to be of great strategic and national importance, has been in development since 2009. It was granted
environmental clearance
in 2010 but was delayed due to pending
forest clearances
.
Originally, Navayuga Engineering. through its wholly owned subsidiary Regina Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (RIPL), had invested ₹235.35 crore and held 21.55% in the company. The company had also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the promoters of Athena Demwe Power to eventually acquire a controlling stake of 51% through further infusion of funds. However, in September 2017, Athena Demwe Power was admitted for insolvency resolution following an application filed by the
Indian Bank
. The company's total admitted liabilities are of ₹566 crore.
The genesis of the dispute lies in the lenders' decision to disqualify Navayuga Engineering as a resolution applicant under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Subsequently, the company approached the National Company Law Tribunal to challenge the decision of the committee of creditors (CoC) to disqualify the company.
In 2018, the government introduced Section 29A, which disqualifies defaulting promoters and connected entities from bidding for their own companies.
Live Events
On May 26 last year, the tribunal upheld the CoC's decision of Navayuga Engineering's disqualification, after which the company approached the appellate tribunal.
Before the appellate tribunal's order, the company's resolution professional (RP) Umesh Garg, through his counsels NPS Chawla and Sujoy Datta of law firm Aekom Legal, argued that Navayuga Engineering was exercising control over the corporate debtor (Athena Demwe Power) through RIPL, which held 21.55% equity shares in the corporate debtor.
Navayuga Engineering had invested ₹236 crore for a 21.55% stake through wholly owned subsidiary RIPL and it was in a position to invest an additional ₹730 crore for an additional stake.
A revival plan submitted by Sikkim Power Investment Corporation Ltd has already been approved by the CoC of the company and is pending the tribunal's approval. Besides, the Union power ministry-controlled THDC India Ltd and the state of Arunachal Pradesh have approached the tribunal, seeking an opportunity to submit their revival plans for the company.
""Even if the appellant was not the promoter of the corporate debtor since inception, after the execution of the MoU... the appellant was given control and management of the corporate debtor,"" the division bench of chairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan and technical member Barun Mitra said in its order of February 16. ""We do not find any error in the order passed by the adjudicating authority (NCLT) warranting interference by us in this appeal.""

India's power consumption grows 7.5% in April-January this fiscal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-grows-7-5-in-april-january-this-fiscal/articleshow/107791219.cms,18-02-2024,"India's power consumption increased 7.5 per cent on-year to 1354.97 billion units (BU) in the April-January period of this financial year, indicating an uptick in economic activities across the country. Power consumption in the country has increased to 1354.97 billion units (BU) in the April-January period of this financial year, from 1259.49 BU in the April-January period of fiscal 2022-23, according to government data.
It was 1505.91 BU in the entire fiscal year of 2022-23, the data showed.
Experts believe the 7.5 per cent growth in power consumption in the country clearly shows a perk up in economic activities in the first 10 months of this fiscal year.
They said power consumption grew in August, September and October, mainly due to humid weather conditions, and a pick-up in industrial activities ahead of the festive season.
Experts are predicting a steady power consumption growth due to improvement in economic activities and cold wave conditions in February. They are of the view that India will have a steady growth in power consumption as well as demand during the current fiscal year.

The National Statistical Office has pegged Indian economic growth at 7.3 per cent in 2023-24 over and above the provisional growth rate of 7.2 per cent during the last financial year in its first advance estimates released earlier in January.
Power consumption in January rose 5.4 per cent to 133.18 BU, compared to 126.30 BU, the data showed.
The peak power demand met -- the highest supply in a day -- rose to 222.32 GW in January 2024. The peak power supply stood at 210.72 GW in January 2023 and 192.18 GW in January 2022.
Experts said that power consumption as well as demand improved in January as mercury fell sharply in the month, especially in North India.
The cold wave resulted in increased use of heating equipment like heaters, blowers and geysers which led to increase of power demand as well as consumption.
The power ministry had estimated the country's
electricity
demand to touch 229 GW during the summer in 2023.
The demand did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rains.
The peak supply, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July.
Peak demand touched 238.82 GW in August.
In September 2023, it was 243.27 GW. The peak demand was 222.16 GW in October, 204.77 GW in November and 213.62 GW in December 2023.
Industry experts said power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June last year due to widespread rainfall.

Power Grid unfazed by proposed O&M norms changes by CERC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-grid-unfazed-by-proposed-om-norms-changes-by-cerc/articleshow/107770975.cms,17-02-2024,"Power Grid Corporation
(
POWERGRID
) expects ""no impact"" from proposed changes in Operation & Maintenance (O&M) charges norms by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (
CERC
), a top company official said. The official said the company was in discussion with the regulator.
Draft regulations suggest altering the prior 75:25 (sub-station vs transmission line) O&M cost distribution to 65:35 ratio, increasing transmission line charges while decreasing substation charges.
Chairman and Managing Director
Ravindra Kumar Tyagi
claimed ""net impact is almost zero,"" with overall O&M charges maintained.
""They have added one more element, 'reactor'. Earlier, we were not incurring any O&M charges for reactors. Now,
reactor charges
have been added per MVAR (Mega Volt-Ampere Reactive), similar to transformer charges per
MVA
capacity, such as Rs 20 lakh or so per MVA. Therefore, those charges have been added. The net impact is negligible almost zero, we are going to receive the same O&M charges as before"", he told investors in an analyst call.
Speaking regarding Return on
Equity
(ROE), proposed norms suggest existing assets at 15.5 per cent and setting 15 per cent for new projects after April 1, 2024, he said discussions were on with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and power grid was optimistic that final norms won't adversely affect the company's revenue or profitability.

""The power sector is where we are evolving, where the demand is going to grow, and where we are doing new things,"" he said.
Electricity generation and consumption has gone up by 60% today as compared to 2014-15. ""This sector will reward you. Because for the next three decades, the demand is actually going to be slightly more than the supply,"" Singh said while talking about the investment in the sector. The challenge is to make sure that supply keeps pace with demand, he said.
""We will have 65% of our electricity coming from non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030,"" he said.
Speaking about the performance of power sector PSUs, the minister said their share prices have gone up by 2.5-3 times in recent years and that they will keep growing, since the power sector is where the demand is growing and where we are doing new things and evolving.
Singh emphasised India's commitment to generating round-the-clock renewable power. The government has decided to invite bids for 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for five years starting the current financial year.
India has committed to achieving 50% non-fossil fuel-based installed electricity capacity by 2030. So far, a total of 187 GW capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources has been installed in the country. The government is targeting another 80 GW of thermal capacity by FY32 to meet rising demand.

KSK Mahanadi lenders may ask NCLT to speed up firm's sale process,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ksk-mahanadi-lenders-may-ask-nclt-to-speed-up-firms-sale-process/articleshow/107566801.cms,10-02-2024,"MUMBAI: Lenders to
KSK Mahanadi
Power will seek the bankruptcy tribunal's intervention to expedite the company's sale process, which has been hanging fire for more than five years, multiple people aware of the matter told ET.
On February 6, a requisite majority of KSK Mahanadi lenders passed a resolution to appeal to the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) to vacate a stay on the resolution process of the thermal power company and allow a standalone resolution of the company, the sources said.
Lenders have verified claims of Rs 29,330 crore in the company that operates three 600 mw units in Chhattisgarh.
NCLT had stayed the sale process in June 2022 following a plea from a lender to consolidate the resolution of KSK Mahanadi Power and two of its ancillary companies -
KSK Water Infrastructure
, which supplies water to the plant, and Raigarh Champa Rail, which carries the raw material.
Both the ancillary companies were separately admitted for corporate insolvency.

Lenders wanted a consolidated resolution to maximise recovery, but NCLT rejected the consolidation proposal. Subsequently, lenders appealed against the tribunal's order at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
).
Meanwhile, PWC-supported resolution professional (RP)
Sumit Binani
invited offers for the thermal power company without waiting for NCLAT to pass an order.
In this context, the tribunal passed an order in June 2022 directing the RP to defer the resolution process and ""not to undertake any process"" until further orders subject to the outcome of the appeal pending before the NCLAT.
The appellate tribunal, too, has stayed the resolution process until it passes a final order on the matter.
Lenders will appeal with both NCLT and NCLAT to vacate the stay and allow a standalone resolution, the people cited above said.
In the past,
Adani Power
,
Vedanta
, Naveen Jindal-promoted Jindal Power, and Megha Engineering submitted expressions of interest for the thermal power company.
Over the past two years, a dozen lenders of KSK Mahanadi with about Rs 16,165 crore of verified claims have separately sold their debts to various ARCs due to delays in resolution. As many as six ARCs jointly control 54.4% of verified claims after acquiring loans from multiple banks.

"Adani Power wins bid for Lanco Amarkantak at ₹4,101 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-wins-bid-for-lanco-amarkantak-at-4101-crore/articleshow/107534401.cms,09-02-2024,"Mumbai:
Adani Power
was declared the winning bidder for debt-laden
Lanco Amarkantak
Power, offering ₹4,101 crore at the
auction
held Wednesday, said people with knowledge of the matter. The other two applicants in the fray-
Reliance Industries
and a
Power Finance Corporation
(PFC)-led consortium- did not participate in the auction.
That resulted in the Adani Group company being declared the winning bidder for the active power producer, said the people cited above.
Lenders had pegged Adani Power's latest offer of ₹4,101 crore as the base price for the auction of the
thermal power company
. They also stipulated that the counteroffers should be at least ₹50 crore higher than the base
bid
for the auction to proceed.
Adani Power and the KPMG-backed resolution professional, Saurabh Kumar Tikmani, did not respond to ET's request for comments.
Lanco Amarkantak Power was admitted for corporate insolvency proceedings in September 2019, but its resolution got delayed for various reasons. In January 2022, lenders rejected the sole offer of ₹3,000 crore from Twin Star Technologies, a company owned by metals maven Anil Agarwal, on the ground that it was too low.

Later, when lenders restarted the sale process, Adani, Reliance Industries and the PFC-led consortium showed interest in acquiring the company. Adani and Reliance did not participate in the auction, citing a violation of the sale process, while the PFC-led consortium was sole bidder offering ₹3,020 crore. In January 2023, 95% of lenders by value voted in favour of the PFC-led consortium's plan but the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) did not endorse the plan for several months.
Thereafter, Adani Power gave an unsolicited improved offer of ₹3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2, and later, it improved the offer to ₹4,101 crore, as reported by ET on December 13.
Just when lenders were considering Adani's offer, Jindal Power filed a petition with the tribunal seeking approval to participate in the proposed auction of Lanco Amarkantak. It gave a Rs 4,203 crore cash offer along with a Rs 100-crore bank guarantee, as reported by ET on January 13 and January 17, respectively. Jindal Power's Rs 4,203 crore offer is a tad higher than Rs 4,101 crore offered by Adani Power a month ago.
However, within 10 days, Jindal Power did a U-turn and withdrew from the race for Lanco Amarkantak, as reported by ET on January 25.
Lanco Amarkantak's first phase, which is fully operational, has two units of 300 MW each.
The second phase, under construction, comprises two units of 600 MW each. It has Rs 1,800 crore cash in the company solely on account of operations from the first phase.
The resolution professional has admitted Rs 14,632 crore of claims from 17 lenders.

.
The money was distributed to banks late on Tuesday evening and equates to a recovery of 43% of their principal dues including some pass through payments which were stuck due to litigation between the plant owners and the government.
""This is one chunky recovery after many weeks and will directly boost bank bottom lines in the fourth quarter. The government has also paid some receivables which were due that has boosted recovery,"" said a person aware of the transaction.
IDBI Bank is the largest beneficiary from this account receiving Rs 306 crore, followed by

The project was conceived back in 1994 and had a memorandum of understanding with the Punjab State Power Corp (PSPC) to supply power for 25 years but the project failed to take off due to problems regarding coal availability.
Total admitted claims amounted to Rs 6,584 crore including Rs 650 crore in receivables from the PSPC. Lenders have received some of these receivables with the settlement too.
The state government stepped in as the sole bidder in July 2023 after earlier bidders including large power producers like Adani Power, Jindal Power and Vedanta backed out over concerns on litigations between the private power producer and state government over non-payment of dues, ET had reported in its July 6, 2023 edition.
""The government as a bidder was a win-win for banks because it meant that some of the pending dues could be received smoothly. On a principal basis including the receivables recovered banks have approximately made a recovery of about 60% which is a very good rate,"" said a person familiar with the deal.
Earlier in January, Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann had announced that the government had completed formalities in purchasing the plant.
The 540-MW thermal power plant is an independent power plant and is spread over 1,100 acres of land in Goindwal Sahib in Tarn Taran.
Mann said the plant will now be called Sri Guru Amardas Thermal Power Plant after the third Sikh Guru.

"India, Lanka joint panel meet to take grid connectivity further",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-lanka-joint-panel-meet-to-take-grid-connectivity-further/articleshow/107503165.cms,08-02-2024,"Goa:
India
and
Sri Lanka
's joint working committee on the
power sector
will likely meet this month to further discuss
grid interconnectivity
and
renewable energy collaboration
, the island country's power and energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera told ET.
The two countries have been planning to connect their grid to trade power for almost two decades, but the deliberations have picked up pace in the last few years amid green energy ambitions of the countries.
Technical reports are already being discussed with the officials from India's
Central Electricity Authority
(CEA),
Power Grid Corporation of India
and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), ET had reported earlier.
The grid connection will likely be in a joint venture with Power Grid Corporation of India.
Technical feasibility studies have been done and a joint consultant for investment decisions will be appointed for the grid connection, Wijesekera, who is in the country to attend the ongoing India Energy Week, said.
Live Events
""Investment decisions are yet to be made for which we want to appoint consultants. The consultants will be appointed from both ends. I would say a common consulting firm to understand the financial requirements and agree on the investment, and how the investment is going to take place,"" he said.
Discussions will also take place on ongoing projects, especially the solar energy project, where India's NTPC Ltd is in partnership with the Ceylon Electricity Board. Power purchase agreements on the first phase of the 130-MW power project could be signed soon, he said.
Offshore Wind
The Sri Lankan government is assessing the potential the country has in the offshore wind segment after which it will invite an expression of interest, where it wants Indian companies to participate.
There are companies that have shown interest, including Indian companies, Wijesekera said.
Feasibility studies for offshore wind energy are on because the potential that Colombo may have would far exceed its requirements and it's going to be a surplus, he said. ""So if you realise that, of course, we'll have to look at different other models, export energy, maybe in terms of electricity through the power grid, or whether it's going to be green hydrogen in the future is something yet to be decided,"" he said.
Renewable Energy
Sri Lanka has a target to generate 70% of it's electricity through renewable by 2030 for which it needs to integrate at least 5,000 MW more into its power grid. The capacity could be solar, wind, or floating solar, the minister said.

"Jindal Power offers $1.68 bln for distressed coal-based power plant, say sources",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/jindal-power-offers-1-68-bln-for-distressed-coal-based-power-plant-say-sources/articleshow/107463959.cms,06-02-2024,"Jindal Power
, a unit of India's Jindal Steel & Power Ltd, has submitted a 140 billion rupees ($1.69 billion) bid for a coal-based power project in the eastern region, two sources familiar with the development told Reuters.
The company has submitted a financial bid for the distressed
KSK Mahanadi project
that is being eyed by billionaire Gautam Adani's
Adani Power
and Anil Agarwal's London Stock Exchange-listed Vedanta Ltd among others, a source aware of the matter said.
The 1,800-megawatt power project, built by KSK Energy Ventures, is one of many distressed coal-fired private power stations mired in insolvency proceedings in recent years as owners did not have fuel supplies or the funds to complete them.
The project was admitted for insolvency proceedings in October 2019 but the court has not called financial bids since then.
""Jindal Power has submitted an unsolicited bid to authorised resolution professional for KSK Mahanadi Power project in Chhattisgarh,"" a government source said. The two sources did not want to be quoted as they were not authorised to speak to media.

Jindal Power and Sumit Binani- the resolution professional appointed for the KSK Mahanadi power project by the insolvency court - did not respond immediately to a queries sent by Reuters.
The unsolicited bid shows renewed interest of Indian private companies in coal-based power plants.
The share of private investments in India's coal-based power has dwindled after 2018 due to lower demand and an ambitious thrust of the federal government on renewable energy.
Coal-based power plants are back in focus in India as the Asian country expects its demand to cross 260-gigawatts during peak hours in summer this year.
India will operate new coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 13.9 gigawatts until December this year, the highest annual increase in at least six years.

India may launch carbon capture policy to exploit vast coal resources,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-to-launch-carbon-capture-policy-to-exploit-vast-coal-resources/articleshow/107378507.cms,03-02-2024,"India is set to launch a
carbon capture policy
that it says will allow it to keep exploiting its vast coal resources and deal with its growing emissions, according to to a top government energy adviser.
The policy is expected to be unveiled later this year – should Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
’s government retain power in upcoming elections — and will include incentives for companies to trap, recycle and where possible store their emissions underground, said Rajnath Ram, energy adviser at
Niti Aayog
, the policymaking branch of the Indian government.
“The power sector generates 42% of India’s total emissions,” Ram said in an interview. “We estimate that 70% of that can be captured and recycled through
carbon
capture.”
To match increasingly steep demand peaks and avoid blackouts, aggressive renewable deployment is not enough, Ram said. “In the absence of storage, you need to add at least the same amount of thermal capacity. We have abundant coal and we want to use it, in a sustainable way.”
Most climate scenarios deem some amount of carbon removal essential to curb climate change, yet the technologies are still in their infancy, and most project have proved unviable due to high cost and low efficiency.

Net-zero goal: India's interim budget focuses on green economy, climate investments
Budget: Coal gasification of 100 MT to give fillip to end-use sectors like steel, say experts
Need right balance between development & carbon emissions
Around 40 Carbon Capture and Storage units are currently online globally, and 50 more are expected to enter operation by 2030, a pace far too slow to reach carbon neutrality by mid century, according to the International Energy Agency.
India is already exploring coal gasification, for which it is setting aside 85 billion rupees ($1 billion) in subsidies to help get projects off the ground. The early-stage technology, which turns coal into gas to generate electricity, results in marginally lower emissions compared to conventional coal firing.

Coal-based capacity additions are being encouraged by the government after a long hiatus as the country's demand has been increasing sharply and is likely to grow in the future.
The power ministry increased its projection of thermal capacity requirement and addition by 30 GW to 80 GW by 2031-32.
Thermal energy was written off a few years ago, which was premature, power minister RK Singh had said in November. Thermal cannot be written off until energy storage becomes viable, he had said.
Thermal power is going to stay until energy storage becomes cost-effective for round-the-clock supply through renewable energy, the minister said. Non-solar hours are going to be a serious challenge, considering growing power demand and weather events like the one in August this year, he had said.

India's power consumption rises nearly 6% to 133.83 billion units in Jan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-rises-nearly-6-to-133-83-billion-units-in-jan/articleshow/107326137.cms,01-02-2024,"India's
power consumption
grew nearly six per cent to 133.83 Billion Units (BU) in
January
2024 as compared to the year-ago period, according to
government
data. In January 2023, power consumption stood at 126.30 BU, higher than 111.80 BU recorded in the same month a year ago, the data showed.
The peak power
demand
met -- the highest supply in a day -- rose to 222.32 GW in January 2024. The peak power supply stood at 210.72 GW in January 2023 and 192.18 GW in January 2022.
Experts said that power consumption as well as demand improved in January as mercury fell sharply in the month, especially in
North India
.
The cold wave resulted in increased use of heating equipment like heaters, blowers and geysers which led to increase of power demand as well as consumption.
The
power ministry
had estimated the country's
electricity
demand to touch 229 GW during the summer in 2023. The demand did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rains.

The peak supply, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July.
Peak demand touched 238.82 GW in August. In September 2023, it was 243.27 GW. The peak demand was 222.16 GW in October, 204.77 GW in November and 213.62 GW in December 2023.
Industry experts said power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June last year due to widespread rainfall. They said power consumption grew in August, September and October, mainly due to humid weather conditions, and also a pick-up in industrial activities ahead of the festive season.
Experts are expecting steady power consumption
growth
due to improvement in economic activities and continuation of cold wave in February.

Narendra Modi is scheduled to dedicate two
power projects
by
NTPC
and lay the foundation stone of another with a total
investment
of Rs 28,978 crore during his daylong visit to
Odisha
on February 3. Modi is scheduled to dedicate the Darlipali Super Thermal Power Station (2x800 MW) and
NSPCL Rourkela PP Expansion Project
(1x250 MW) and lay the foundation stone of NTPC's Talcher Thermal Power Project, (2x660 MW) during the visit.
Addressing a press conference, NTPC's regional executive director (Eastern Region I & II) Sudip Nag said, ""The upcoming power projects will be flagged-off by the prime minister.""
Located in Sundergarh district, the Darlipali STPP is a pit-head power station with supercritical (highly efficient) technology and will supply
low-cost power
to its beneficiary states such as Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Sikkim.
The 250 MW project of NTPC-SAIL Power Company Ltd was established in Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) to provide reliable power for the steel plant, which is vital for economic growth, he said, adding that the NTPC is developing the Talcher Thermal Power Project, Stage-III, within the old TTPS plant premises in Angul district, was taken over by NTPC from Odisha State Electricity Board in 1995.
After completing more than 50 years of service, the old TTPS plant was decommissioned.
Live Events
The upcoming plant will have highly efficient ultra-supercritical technology-based units and approximately three times the capacity of the old TTPS plant.
While 50 per cent capacity of this project is dedicated to Odisha, other beneficiary states such as Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Assam will also get low-cost power from this pit-head station.
This project is under construction with all modern environmental features like efficient electrostatic precipitator, flue gas desulphurization, bio-mass cofiring, and covered storage space for coal, and help in lesser specific coal consumption and C02 emissions, the official said.
Some top officials of the company were also present at the press meet.
Besides creating direct and indirect employment opportunities in the region, these projects have contributed to the improvement of
physical infrastructure
such as approach roads, drainage, transportation and communication facilities.
NTPC has undertaken various community development initiatives in the surrounding villages, such as education, drinking water, sanitation, health, women empowerment and rural sports. The company has also set up a medical college-cum-Hospital in Sundergarh, the official said.

India rebuilds coal stocks to ensure electric reliability: Kemp,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-rebuilds-coal-stocks-to-ensure-electric-reliability-kemp/articleshow/107292859.cms,31-01-2024,"India's
electricity supply
is much more comfortable at the start of 2024 than in either 2023 or 2022 as
coal
production has ramped up and the huge deployment of renewables has relieved pressure on fuel inventories.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
After a weak monsoon curtailed hydro generation and forced the country to rely heavily on coal-fired generation in the summer and autumn of 2023, fuel inventories fell to critically low levels in October.
But they recovered strongly in November, December and January, with record volumes of coal dug and despatched by rail to generators over the last three months.
Plentiful stocks of coal at power plants should minimise the risk of blackouts during the difficult spring period even if temperatures are hotter than usual in March and April.
Generators are currently storing 38 million tonnes of coal on site, up from 33 million tonnes at the same point in 2023 and 25 million tonnes in 2022, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority.

Fuel inventories are sufficient to cover almost 14 days of generators' minimum requirements up from 12 days in 2023 and nine days in 2022.
The more comfortable fuel situation is partly the result of a determined effort to boost coal production and ensure coal deliveries are prioritised on the railway network.
The country's mines raised production by 106 million metric tons (12%) and the volume delivered to generators increased by 50 million tons (7%) in 2023 compared with 2022.
The number of unit coal trains despatched to power producers averaged 279 per day in December 2023, a new monthly record and up from 269 per day in December 2022.
As a result, coal-fired power plants were able to generate an extra 11 billion kilowatt-hours (6%) in November-December compared with the same period in 2022 while still accumulating fuel.
PRE-MONSOON READINESS
India's electricity consumption peaks between June and August, when temperatures are hottest and the demand for air-conditioning and refrigeration is greatest.
But the summer monsoon is also when generation from hydroelectric sources and wind farms is greatest, relieving some of the pressure on the electricity transmission network.
As a result, power supplies tend to be most stretched in March and April, before the monsoon arrives, when temperatures and air-conditioning have started to rise but renewable generation is still low.
The same problem occurs in reverse after the monsoon in September and October, when renewable generation starts to fade while air-conditioning demand is still elevated.
The pre- and post-monsoon shoulder seasons are therefore when electricity supplies are under most pressure and the system relies heavily on extra generation from coal-fired units.
In contrast to North America and Europe where the greatest risk of blackouts occurs at the height of summer or the depths of winter, India's greatest reliability challenge occurs in spring and autumn.
The country needs to accumulate coal inventories during the summer wet season and especially in winter to ensure coal units can maximise generation during the shoulder seasons.
In September-October 2021 and again in March-April 2022 the grid was hit by widespread outages when coal generators ran out of fuel and could not start up during periods of hot weather.
Insufficient generation caused the grid's frequency to drop far below its minimum operating target of 49.9 cycles per second for prolonged periods.
Frequency fell below target 11% of the time in October 2021 and 32% of the time in April 2022 as generators could not keep up with load in hot weather.
Many generators ran out of coal and were unable to fire up when instructed by the grid. Accumulating coal inventories has therefore been a priority for the government and generators to avoid any repeat.
Stock building so far this winter has put the system in a much more resilient position to cope with the pre-monsoon increase in demand.
RENEWABLES DEPLOYMENT
In addition to boosting coal mining, India has been able to relieve some of the pressure on coal supplies through a massive expansion of renewable generation, saving significant quantities of fuel.
The country has installed 79 gigawatts (GW) of additional generating capacity since the end of 2018, with capacity increasing at a compound rate of 4% per year.
But just 10 GW of extra capacity has been coal-fired (an average increase of just 1% per year) with 60 GW coming from renewables (a compound increase of 13% per year).
Solar capacity has surged by 48 GW (24% per year) with smaller increase in wind capacity of 10 GW (5% per year), according to Central Electricity Authority data.
Solar and wind generation are intermittent so they are not a perfect match for the rapidly increasing air-conditioning, refrigeration and industrial load.
Wind speeds are variable and increased reliance on solar has created shortages in the evening when cooling loads are still high but solar output has faded with sunset.
But by easing some of the pressure on coal-fired generators at least some of the time it has enabled stock building and reduced the threat of fuel shortages and blackouts.

Sinnar Thermal to undergo IBC process as NCLAT vacates stay,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sinnar-thermal-to-undergo-ibc-process-as-nclat-vacates-stay/articleshow/107271022.cms,31-01-2024,"Former Indiabulls promoter Rajiv Rattan has lost control of
Sinnar Thermal
Power after the bankruptcy appellate court vacated a stay to initiate corporate insolvency against the company.
Sinnar Thermal Power (STPL) is a subsidiary of the listed company
RattanIndia Power
, one of the largest distressed power producers, which has a 1,350 MW power plant at Nashik in Maharashtra.
The National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) admitted the company for corporate insolvency on September 19, 2022. However, a week later, the appellate tribunal stayed insolvency proceedings in the backdrop of the government's initiative to revive thermal power projects due to a shortage of power.
Shapoorji Pallonji and Co, operational creditors, pleaded to vacate the stay on the power company. It had a contract to construct a part of the plant at Sinnar, in the Nashik district. The work done by Shapoorji Pallonji was worth ₹208 crore, of which it received payment of ₹146 crore, and ₹62 crore is outstanding. The Delhi High Court stayed the revocation of the bank guarantee on August 20, 2019.
RattanIndia alleged that payment was not made due to slow progress which delayed the project. While vacating the stay, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal stated, ""the alleged delay during the course of execution of contracts cannot be treated as an issue which may adversely affect rights of the operational creditor under Section 9 of the Code"".

Lenders are hoping to recover at least half of their debt since in recent months, several corporates such as Adani Power, Jindal Power and Vedanta have shown interest in acquiring distressed power companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
The total debt of STPL is estimated at ₹6,000 crore, said a lender. STPL has five commissioned units but is unable to commence commercial operations due to a lack of a power purchase agreement for the offtake of power, according to the disclosure made to the exchanges. It has coal linkages from Coal India's subsidiaries, the company disclosed on its website.
RattanIndia has two special purpose vehicles for power production - in Amravati and Nashik - both with installed capacity of 1,350 MW. While the Amravati power plant's ₹6,574 crore debt was restructured in 2019, RattanIndia failed in its attempt to recast the debt of the Nashik power plant.

Tata Power proposes tariff revisions in Mumbai with sharpest jump for lower end consumers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/tata-power-proposes-tariff-revisions-in-mumbai-with-sharpest-jump-for-lower-end-consumers/articleshow/107239513.cms,29-01-2024,"Discom Tata Power
on Monday proposed a ""rationalization"" of tariffs, which could see a sharp rise in power rates especially for lower end consumers. The utility published an advertisement in newspapers, wherein it proposed to increase the rate per unit to Rs 7.37 per unit from the present Rs 3.74 paid by subscribers consuming up to 100 units per month, while the same for those for between 101-300 units is proposed to be increased to Rs 9.31 per unit from the present Rs 5.89.
When asked about the virtual doubling of charges for those consuming up to 100 units per month, a
Tata Power
official explained that the
Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission
had stayed an earlier tariff structure in July and reverted to an older stricture first introduced in 2020.
If not for the stay, a consumer would be paying Rs 6.53 per unit, the official said, pointing out that the degree of the increase being proposed would be lower then.
The official said that earlier, the difference between the lowest slab and the highest one (above 500 units) was over Rs 7 wherein the high-end consumers were subsidizing the lower-end ones, and hence, a rationalization is necessary.
There was also an attrition of high-end subscribers to rival
Adani Electricity Mumbai
, the official admitted. At present, Tata Power distribution serves 7.5 lakh customers in the financial capital, of which 5.5 lakh are residential ones who typically use under 300 units a month, the official said.
Live Events
The ""rationalization"" is being proposed from April 1 onwards, the official said, adding that stakeholders have 15 days to give feedback to the electricity watchdog and if necessary, the
MERC
can also schedule a hearing on the issue.

minister
Pralhad Joshi
Thursday said his ministry will request
imported coal-based power plants
to consider switching to
domestic fuel-based design
and technology as production in India is set to rise.
""Enough [domestic] coal will be available and will become competitive [for imported coal-based power plants],""
Joshi
said. The ministry is aiming for zero
thermal coal import
by FY26, he added.
The
coal production
target for 2026-27 is 1.4 billion tonnes and for 2029-30 it is 1.58 billion tonnes, the ministry had said in November. The target for FY24 is 1.01 billion tonnes. The production plan includes opening of new mines, expansion of mines capacity and production from captive and commercial mines. All these three operational components are contributing and have clear plans for further enhancement.
The railway ministry is making best efforts to supply sufficient rakes, Joshi said.
The government is trying to address the logistical challenges in transporting coal with dedicated corridors while
Coal India
is also investing in its infrastructure, he said. India has a proven reserve of 361 billion metric tonnes of thermal coal. About 80% of coal produced in the country is used in
thermal power plants

Thermal power plants' capacity utilisation to rise to 69 pc in FY'25: ICRA,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/thermal-power-plants-capacity-utilisation-to-rise-to-69-pc-in-fy25-icra/articleshow/107145047.cms,25-01-2024,"New Delhi: The
capacity utilisation
of
thermal power plants
will increase by a percentage point to 69 per cent in 2024-25, led by the growth in electricity
demand
and limited thermal capacity addition, says rating agency ICRA.
ICRA
's outlook for the thermal power segment is 'Stable', supported by the healthy improvement in the thermal plant load factor (
PLF
), coupled with the reduction in dues from
state distribution utilities
(discoms) following the implementation of the Late Payment
Surcharge
(LPS) scheme since August 2022, a statement said.
""The current under-construction thermal capacity is about 30 GW, which is predominantly in the Central and the state-owned generation segment and is expected to be commissioned over the next two to four-year period,"" Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said in the statement.
In our view, there is a clear need for incremental capacity beyond this pipeline if the annual electricity demand growth continues to exceed 6.0 per cent till 2030, after factoring in the renewable capacity addition, he added.
He stated that if annual demand growth is stronger at 7.5 per cent till 2030, to meet the same, the incremental thermal capacity requirement will need to be as large as 70 GW.
Coal has remained a dominant fuel source to meet the base load power demand in the country, and its share in the overall energy generation mix is estimated to decline from 73 per cent in FY2023 to about 58-60 per cent in FY2030, assuming the renewable capacity addition scenario of 200 GW between FY2024 and FY2030, as per ICRA estimates.
Live Events
Nonetheless, the share of coal in the generation mix is expected to remain significant till 2030, it stated.
The average spot power tariffs in the day-ahead market (
DAM
) of the
Indian Energy Exchange
remained high at Rs 5.4 per unit in YTD FY2024, owing to the sharp demand growth.
The spot tariffs are likely to remain elevated at around Rs 4.5-5.0/unit in the near-term against a long-term average of Rs 3.0-3.5/unit. Further, the coal stock level for the domestic power plants remained modest at around 12 days as of December 2023, lower than the normative requirement.
Nonetheless, this remains similar to the corresponding period of the previous year, it stated.
For the renewable energy segment, ICRA's outlook remains 'Stable', led by strong policy support, healthy demand prospects, and superior tariff competitiveness.
Further, the realisation of past dues and regular
payment
of ongoing bills by discoms following the LPS scheme remain positives for the sector.
Kadam said in the statement, ""the sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices, abeyance of the order on Approved List of Models and Module Manufacturers (ALMM) till March 2024, and the timeline extension approved for solar and hybrid projects, are expected to lead to an improvement in RE capacity addition to 18-20 GW in FY2024 from 15 GW in FY2023.""
This, he said, along with the growing project pipeline, is likely to support the scale-up in capacity addition to about 25 GW in FY2025, mainly driven by the solar power segment.
However, he stated that challenges remain on the execution front with respect to delays in land acquisition and transmission connectivity, which could hamper the capacity addition prospects.

Following this development, only three bidders - Adani Power,
Reliance Industries
and Power Finance Corporation-led consortium - will participate in the proposed auction process.
On Tuesday, Jindal Power applied with Amravati National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to withdraw its petition, said people with knowledge of the matter.
In mid-January, it sought the tribunal's approval to participate in the sale process of the power company. In response, lenders sought a written commitment that Jindal Power will give an unconditional, upfront cash offer. Lenders also asked them to abide by all Request For Resolution Plant (RFRP) terms.
Agencies
""Jindal Power did not provide a written commitment. They informed the tribunal that they would give it only after receiving approval from adjudicating authority,"" said one of the persons cited above.
Live Events
""Probably they were not comfortable giving unconditional and upfront offer and thus they pulled out of the race,"" the same person added.
Jindal Power did not respond to ET's request for comments.
On January 12, Jindal Power filed a petition with the tribunal seeking approval to participate in the proposed auction of Lanco Amarkantak, and on January 16, it gave ₹4,203 crore cash offer along with a ₹100-crore bank guarantee, as reported by ET on January 13 and January 17, respectively. Jindal Power's ₹4,203 crore offer is a tad higher than ₹4,100 crore offered by Adani Power a month ago.
In a desperate attempt to
acquire
the company, Adani Power improved its offer to ₹4,100 crore from ₹3,650 crore offer given in November. However, Adani's unsolicited offer was made almost 11 months after 95% of lenders voted for a ₹3,020-crore resolution plan given by a PFC-led consortium.
By the time Adani gave an offer, the CCI had endorsed the PFC-led consortium's acquisition and lenders were awaiting NCLT's approval. Hence, lenders sought directions from NCLT to allow them to consider Adani's plan which was made after the voting process concluded. This month, the tribunal permitted lenders to hold a fresh auction for the sale of the thermal power company with Adani's offer of ₹4,100 crore as base bid. Along with the PFC-led consortium, Reliance Industries - which gave a resolution plan initially, too - will be invited to participate in the auction, people cited above said.
Lanco Amarkantak's first phase, which is fully operational, has two units of 300 MW each.
The second phase, under construction, comprises two units of 600 MW each. It has Rs 1,800 crore cash in the company solely on account of operations from the first phase.
KPMG-backed RP Saurabh Kumar has admitted Rs 14,632 crore of claims from 17 lenders.

The company received orders worth Rs 1,235 crore in the quarter under review, slightly up from Rs 1,222.1 crore in the same period a year ago.
The company said data centers and renewables significantly contributed to orders, while transmission and rail segments remained flat.
Notable digitalization orders from energy intensive segments like steel, along with industry training orders demonstrated the urgency for rapid energy transition and electrification percolating across all segments.
Service orders were up over 70 per cent year-on-year led by utilities and industries, it stated.
Export orders were up more than 60 per cent year-on-year during the quarter, driven by transformers and high-voltage products - reaffirming our 'make in India for India and the world' approach, it stated.
Orders for transformers came from
Europe
and African markets, while demand for power quality solutions were from South and Central America,
Africa
, the US and Europe.
As of December 31, 2023, the order backlog stood at Rs 7,552.3 crore, providing revenue visibility for the coming quarters.

Supreme Court upset over registry not listing matter related to Adani Power despite order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/supreme-court-upset-over-registry-not-listing-matter-related-to-adani-power-despite-order/articleshow/107089190.cms,23-01-2024,"The
Supreme Court
on Tuesday got upset with its
registry
for not listing a
matter
related to
Adani Power
despite a
judicial order
. As the bench of
Justices Aniruddha Bose
and
PV Sanjay Kumar
began the day's proceedings, it asked
senior advocate Dushyant Dave
about the Adani Power case.
Dave, who appears for
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited
in the case, told the apex court that when lawyers associated with him approached the registry and asked about the matter, officials there said they had no instructions for listing it.
""If the government were to ignore the court's orders, it would be treated as contempt, but when the registry defies the court's orders, should it not be viewed seriously?"" Dave asked the bench.
The bench wanted to know why and at whose behest the registry had not listed the case for hearing.
""Why? At whose behest? Directed by whom?"" the judges asked and summoned a senior registry official to the court and discussed the matter with him in the chambers.
Live Events
The matter has now been listed as the first case for hearing on Wednesday.
Earlier, Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd, a power distribution company wholly-owned and run by the State of Rajasthan, had written a letter to the Supreme Court Secretary General seeking an enquiry into the listing of an application filed by
Adani Power Rajasthan Limited
(APRL) in a case already decided by the apex court two years ago.
The letter said the listing of APRL's application ""raises an extraordinarily serious question going to the very root of the institutional integrity of the Supreme Court's Registry"".

"Coal, hydropower energy transitions in India involve state-sanctioned violence, arrests: Study",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/coal-hydropower-energy-transitions-in-india-involve-state-sanctioned-violence-arrests-study/articleshow/107076690.cms,23-01-2024,"Coal
and
hydropower
energy transitions in India are characterised by significant state-sanctioned violence, which can marginalise Indigenous and frontline communities, new research has found. The study called for an investigation of 'violent transitions', referring to the ways in which the expansion of fossil fuel and low-carbon energy infrastructures are predicated upon direct state-sanctioned violence - including the criminalisation of dissent, protests, and mass mobilisation through police violence and arrests - to facilitate processes of land expropriation.
While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has declared that all coal production must be phased out by 2050 to avoid dangerous levels of global warming, India is in the midst of a fossil-fuelled transition toward increased coal production, the research from the
University of California Irvine
, US, found.
Coal production fuelled 70 per cent of the country's electricity-generating capacity. But the country is also set to expand low-carbon infrastructures by an unprecedented 500 gigawatts by 2030, according to Mukul Kumar, the author of the study published in the journal Climate and Development.
""Both fossil fuel and low-carbon transitions, however, draw upon forms of state violence and land expropriation to expand extractive industries,"" said Kumar, assistant professor of urban planning and public policy, School of Social Ecology, University of California Irvine.
Peaceful, nonviolent movements that challenge the expansion of extractive energy industries are far too often criminalised or subjected to police violence, according to Kumar.

""India is in the midst of multiple violent energy transitions toward both increased fossil fuel and low-carbon energy extraction that further marginalise Indigenous (Adivasi) and frontline communities of Dalits, landless farmers, and artisanal fishers,"" said Kumar.
Drawing on a political ecological analysis of 64 coal projects and 57 hydropower projects in India from the Environmental Justice Atlas, he found that 51.5 per cent of coal projects and 40.3 per cent of hydropower projects involved mass mobilisation, arrests and violence.
In his study, Kumar explains the concept of 'just transition', often defined as a process of including particular kinds of fossil fuel workers in the transition towards low-carbon energy.
""Missing from such liberal framings of just transitions is an engagement with how the extraction of both fossil fuels and low-carbon energy is contingent upon state violence and the expropriation of Indigenous and frontline communities' lands,"" Kumar wrote in his study.
Analysing the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Just Transition's recommendations to form a Just Transition Taskforce with representatives from industries, state and regional governments, and impacted communities, Kumar found that ""forms of state violence, such as police violence and arrests, often preclude democratic and meaningful participation in energy policies in India.""
""If
energy transition
policies fail to reckon with historical injustices of state violence and land expropriation within the context of fossil fuel and low-carbon energy transitions, 21st century energy transitions risk reproducing earlier models of extractive development that are neither sustainable nor just,"" said Kumar.
He said that his research findings aim to inform energy policy debates and scholarship in India, and urged energy policy makers and researchers to ""repair and redress, rather than disavow"" the role of state-sanctioned violence in India's energy transitions.

and
Jindal Power
are among companies likely to show interest in acquiring
Hiranmaye Energy
, a thermal power company which was recently admitted for corporate insolvency, said people aware of development. Hiranmaye Energy, formerly
India Power Corp
(Haldia), was admitted for corporate insolvency early this month at the behest of a petition filed by REC.
The company has principal loans of Rs 2,000 crore with REC and Power Finance Corp (PFC) as prominent lenders.
It had three units of 150 MW each located in Haldia, Kolkata, but at present, only two units are operational, and one unit is under construction. It had signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with the West Bengal government in 2017 and has a coal procurement agreement with Coal India. BHEL designed and built the plant.
The Kolkata bench of NCLT appointed Bhuvan Madan as resolution professional, who in turn will be supported by a team from EY led by Pulkit Gupta, partner at the consulting firm.
Adani Power and Jindal Power did not respond to ET's request for comments.
Live Events
The bankrupt power company is linked to Hemant Kanoria, the erstwhile promoter of Srei Infrastructure Finance and Srei Equipment, which, too, had undergone insolvency proceedings and was later acquired by National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL).
In 2013, REC and PFC had collectively provided a loan of Rs 1,859 crore to Hiranmaye Energy to build the power plants, but the company was unable to pay the outstanding amounts under the original terms since March 31, 2018, according to an admission order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
Later, financial creditors made efforts to implement a restructuring plan, but it could not be implemented as the company failed to comply with the terms of the restructuring plan and the project continued to be under stress, noted the lender’s senior counsel, according to the tribunal's order. He also submitted that there was no restructuring agreement between the creditor and the borrower.
According to a July 28, 2023, ratings report by Care Ratings, India Power Corporation had invested Rs 490.5 crore in Hiranmaye Energy Ltd in the form of fully compulsorily convertible debentures (FCCD) at face value of Rs 10 each. These FCCDs were transferred to Power Trust at book value in March 2017. Thereafter, the company ceased to be a subsidiary of IPCL from March 31, 2017, and became an associate, the report said.
In 2017-18, IPCL transferred the remaining investment in compulsorily convertible preference shares amounting to Rs 306.8 crore to Power Trust.
In 2010, the Kanoria family acquired DPSC Ltd, through its investment company India Power Corporation Ltd, from Andrew Yule & Co. Ltd. In 2013, the erstwhile IPCL merged into DPSC, and consequently, its name was changed to IPCL.

power generation
increased 7.14 per cent to 872 billion units (BU) in the April-December period of the current fiscal. The rise in domestic coal-based electricity generation reflects an ample supply of
coal
to meet the growing
energy demand
in the country, the

said in a statement.
Domestic coal-based power generation was 813.9 BU in the year-ago period, it said.
In the country, power is generated from conventional sources -- thermal, nuclear and hydro-- and renewable sources -- wind, solar, biomass etc. Thermal power producers use coal as the main fuel to run the units and the dry fuel contributes to more than 70 per cent of the total electricity generation.
Coal-based power generation in the country registered a growth of around 10.13 per cent during April-December period of FY'24, as compared to the corresponding period of previous year while overall power generation grew 6.71 per cent during the same period, the ministry statement said.
Coal imports
for blending dropped by 40.66 per cent to 17.08 MT during April-December period of current fiscal from 28.78 MT in the corresponding period of previous year, despite the rising power demand.

It has via REC Solar signed a supply agreement with China-based Suzhou Maxwell Technologies to buy a high efficiency production line for HJT cells (4.8GW capacity). It signed a 5.2GW HJT module automation production agreement with China-based SC Solar in January 2023.
It won PLIs under both rounds of solar modules PLI (Round 1: USD 0.3 billion, 4GW; Round 2: USD 0.4 billion, 6GW). Reliance (apart from Greenko) is the only company to win incentives for both green hydrogen and electrolysers concluded recently.
It won incentives of USD 0.3 per kg for electrolyser capacity of 300MW and USD 0.23 for green hydrogen capacity of 90,000 tonnes.
Besides, it has won PLI under ACC battery storage for 5GW capacity.
""These incentives are likely to assist Reliance achieve a green hydrogen cost of USD 1' 1.5 per kg,"" Nuvama said.
Given RIL is the largest producer and consumer of grey hydrogen, transition to green hydrogen shall enable it to improve margins ahead, it said.
The current green hydrogen cost hovers USD 3 per kg, which remains 1.5x compared to grey hydrogen produced using natural gas due to the high cost of generating solar/wind energy as well as high electrolyser cost.
Presently, a hybrid of solar and wind remains the cheapest source of generating green hydrogen. The cost for solar remains the highest due to low PLF of electrolysers at 30' 35 per cent versus wind at 65' 70 per cent, and for hybrid 70' 75 per cent.

According to experts, power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June this year due to widespread rainfall.
They said power consumption grew in August, September, and October, mainly due to humid weather conditions and also perk up in industrial activities due to the effect of festive rush.
The data shows that the power demand has gone up by 50.8 per cent in energy terms from 2013-14 to 2022-23.
The peak power demand has gone up from 136 GW in 2013-14 to 243 GW in September 2023.
Speaking about the rising power demand earlier this month in a summit, Union Power Minister R K Singh had informed that ""By 2030, the peak electricity demand is likely to cross 400 GW, indicating the fast growth of the economy.
""The demand grew at 9 per cent last year, and is growing at 10 per cent this year. On a daily basis, the demand is 8 GW - 10 GW more than the same day of the previous year. There is no other market as big and growing as fast as us.""
Singh had also said that the nation will add enough capacity to meet this burgeoning demand.

BSES Yamuna Power Ltd
, and
Tata Power Delhi Distribution Company
and Noida Power Company Ltd have topped the ratings of the power distribution companies in the country in FY23.
Power minister

, launched the consumer service ratings of discoms, covering performance of discoms for FY 23 while taking a review meeting of the sector on Friday.
""As per the ratings,
NPCL
, BRPL, BYPL and TPDDL have achieved A+ (highest) ranking among all the 62 rated discoms in the country,"" the power ministry said. Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra's power distribution companies were rated among the next best with an 'A' rating.
Singh emphasised on increasing Roof Top Solar installations in the country and on interventions required from states and discoms and the Centre for simplifying roof top solar installations. He also said that tariffs should be reflective of cost of supply and should be up to date. Realistic and prudent loss reduction trajectories should be adopted by power sector regulators to ensure viability of distribution companies. The companies were advised to adopt prepaid smart metering and on priority for government offices, to overcome the issue of outstanding government department dues.

Peak power demand likely to cross 400GW by 2030: R K Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/peak-power-demand-likely-to-cross-400gw-by-2030-r-k-singh/articleshow/106990885.cms,19-01-2024,"Peak power demand
in India is likely to cross 400 GW by 2030 and more generation capacity is being set up to meet the rising demand, Union Power Minister
R K Singh
has said. Electricity is the most important infrastructure which is a sine qua non for development, the minister said at a summit here on Thursday.
One major distinguishing feature between a developing and a developed country is that in a developed country, there is no load shedding, the minister was quoted as saying in a release by the
Power Ministry
.
""No country can develop if it does not have sufficient power. The power shortage in India has come down from around 4.5 per cent in 2014 to less than 1 per cent today.
""We have ensured universal electricity access, connecting 29 million homes in 19 months, which the
International Energy Agency
called the largest and fastest expansion of energy access in the history of the power sector,"" he added.
Speaking about the rising power demand, the minister informed that in 2014, the peak demand was around 130 GW while today it is in the region of 243 GW.

""By 2030, the peak electricity demand is likely to cross 400 GW, indicating the fast growth of the economy. The demand grew at 9 per cent last year, and is growing at 10 per cent this year. On a daily basis, the demand is 8 GW - 10 GW more than the same day previous year. There is no other market as big and growing as fast as us,"" he pointed out.
He said that the nation will add enough capacity to meet this burgeoning demand.
""We will cross 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. We already have 7 million tonnes of green hydrogen manufacturing lined up,"" he added.
The minister informed the industry that the total investments made in the power sector in the last nine years are about Rs 17 lakh crore, and the capacity under construction is worth an investment of a further Rs 17.5 lakh crore.
""We have about 99 GW of renewable energy capacity under construction and around 32 GW of renewables under bidding stage. We shall be bidding around 40 to 50 GW of renewable capacity every year,"" he stated
In thermal capacity, India has about 27 GW under construction.
""We have 47 GW of hydro capacity installed, 18 GW under construction and 13 GW under various stages of survey and investigation,"" he stated.
The government has transformed the power sector and made it viable.
""The AT&C (aggregate technical and commercial) losses have been brought down from 27 per cent to 15.41 per cent. We want to bring it down further to 10 to 11 per cent,"" he added.
India has about 35 GW of pumped storage project capacity lined up.
""We are constructing battery storage capacity as well, though it is expensive at present. Unless we have volumes, the price will not come down,"" he added.
The capacity of module manufacturing has gone up from about 20 GW to about 50 GW now; by 2030, India will have about 24 GW of polysilicon to module manufacturing capacity, he informed.

Nuclear energy players need to take 90% uranium price spike bill or shut plants,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nuclear-energy-players-need-to-take-90-uranium-price-spike-bill-or-shut-plants/articleshow/106980160.cms,19-01-2024,"A product has just gone up in price by 90% in 12 months. It now costs more than it has in 16 years. Most people would think twice about diving into a market like that.
Not so those who run a
nuclear power plant
and must have the product in question:
uranium
. Shutting the plant down will cost you a fortune, says Nick Lawson of advisory firm Ocean Wall. Think $1 million a day. It could also make you extremely unpopular, with one in five households in the US reliant on
nuclear energy
. Worse, if you do have to do it, you can’t flick a switch to turn it back on once your ore has arrived; restarting means new safety checks and regulatory approvals that can take months if not years.
That, along with the fact that uranium is a small part of the overall cost, is why the enriched uranium market is one of the most price inelastic in the world. If you need it, you really need it. The problem — which I imagine is keeping utility managers up most nights — is that an increasingly long list of other people do too.
Governments appear to have finally grasped that
nuclear power
is the only cheap and reliable low-carbon power available — and therefore the only thing that gives them a hope of getting anywhere near their rash net-zero promises. They know they won’t get there with unreliable, expensive and politically divisive wind turbines and solar panels — and (finally) the greens do too.
So the French have given up on their (stupid) plan to reduce the share of electricity generated by nuclear. The UK is (also finally) seriously discussing expanding nuclear capacity and has delayed the closure of four reactors. It has also announced plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on producing the high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) we need for the small modular reactors that are to be our low carbon saviors. And the Chinese, say Alpha Portfolio Management, have 55 nuclear reactors, another 24 under construction and around 150 planned over the next 15 years.

At COP28, 22 countries committed to a trebling of nuclear capacity by 2050. The slightly scary result? Globally
uranium demand
is expected to rise by 28% by 2030 and to double by 2040.
Back to the sleepless nights of our managers. They have not had to worry about uranium supplies for a long time. Nuclear has been out of favour for decades due to disasters in Fukushima and Chernobyl. There has also been a long-term supply overhang that, until very recently, has kept prices well below the cost of production. In the last uranium bull market, that secondary market kicked in, and the price rise, while sharp, was very short. Anyone who wanted uranium could get it with much bother or expense. No more.
The era of overhang is “emphatically behind us,” according to industry research group UxC. There has also been little investment in new mines for a while (why invest with prices so low?); inventories at the big producers are at record lows (Cameco Corp.’s fell more than 35% last year); and those same producers are also reporting production problems. This week, production giant Kazatomprom announced that a shortage of sulphuric acid was causing problems. Cameco warned last September that production levels were falling rather than rising. Expect profit warnings.
The truth is, there just isn’t enough uranium to go around, particularly given a relatively new competitor in the form of funds that hold physical uranium for investors — effectively taking it out of the market. (Yellow Cake Plc and Sprott Physical Uranium Trust are the main culprits here.) The result, says Lawson, is that the current demand for uranium is around 190 million pounds a year. The available supply is 140 million pounds. That’s about a 25% supply deficit already. Most utilities will hold two to three years of inventories. Smart managers might be thinking four or five might help them sleep better. Expense and bother in spades.
Some of you won’t be much bothered about this. You know that the cure for high prices is high prices, that demand begets supply and everything will be fine. But there is a problem with this argument in this market.
First, expanding the supply of uranium will take a long time. Mines don’t open in a day; they take more like a decade. So companies need to be sure that prices are staying high before they start even applying to start digging. They also need to hire: A long bear market has left them with a small and aging group of experts.
Geopolitical conflict clearly doesn’t help. Russia is a huge part of the uranium ecosystem and also owns stakes in some of the producers in Kazakhstan, which produces around 45% of the world’s uranium. Kazakhstan itself is at the center of a uranium great game: Recent visitors include
Xi Jinping
, Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron. Meanwhile, Niger, which produces 5% of the world’s uranium, has just suffered a coup.
The second key point is that this is not just about the ore. You can’t shovel that directly into your power plant and hope for the best. For that, you need enriched uranium. And the supply of this is even tighter and more politically tricky: In 2021, 35% of global enrichment was provided by Russia.
So there you have it. Hedge funds want uranium (they like stuff that is going up fast). ETFs want it. Governments want it. Utilities must have it. They can’t all have what they want at the price they would like. That’s why this price shift is still “very much in its early stages,” says Sean Wade, CEO of Power Metal Resources.
What might bring all this to an end? There might be another accident — although on current numbers, you are four times as likely to be eaten by a shark than injured in a nuclear accident. The small modular reactor rollout could fail — but work on them is far enough advanced to make that seem unlikely. We could figure out how to get uranium from water more effectively (it is currently possible but very expensive). There could also be a breakthrough that overtakes nuclear: If you think fusion or perhaps the direct beaming of solar energy from space is just around the corner, uranium is not for you.
Otherwise, it looks like you should assume it’s likely to stay expensive for some time to come — and that the share prices of the equities in this still tiny and often volatile space will follow. (Total market cap of uranium-related equities is only around $60 billion).
In the UK, the most obvious ways in are via Yellow Cake, a London-listed fund that holds physical uranium, and the Geiger Counter Fund, which holds uranium-related equities. The latter trades on a 16% discount to its net asset value — it might be in a hot sector, but it’s listed on an unpopular market. Both have had very good runs already, but as long as utilities are fighting funds for ore, there may be more to come.

Delhi-based SAEL, promoted by Jasbir Awla, has established waste-to-energy conversion projects in Haryana, UP, Rajasthan and Punjab and also operates solar power plants.
Awla's other business interests include warehousing and agro-processing. The group diversified into renewable energy generation in the past five years.
SAEL uses stubble, which is generated as waste after the rice crop is harvested, and produces energy from the waste. The stubble is usually burnt by farmers which is seen as a major cause of air pollution in northern Indian states. Its total renewable energy generation capacity is pegged at 2.7 gigawatts.

R K Singh on Thursday said that gratuitous
load shedding
will be penalized as it is an insult to the people of the country. Addressing a review meeting, Singh underlined the importance of making load shedding a thing of the past.
The two-day review, planning and monitoring (RPM) meeting of top power and energy officials of the Centre and states, and heads of state distribution companies started here on Thursday. Officials of central public sector enterprises are also participating in the meeting.
""I do not accept a future where India continues to be a developing country. The difference between this future and that of a developed country is very simple: there is no load shedding in a developed country, every discom has money to buy power, people's rights are respected and disruption to power happens once in 20 - 25 years. Hence, load shedding will be penalized, it is an insult to the people,"" Singh said at the meeting.
He asked discoms to add capacity, sign
PPAs
(power purchase agreements), ensure resource adequacy and become more efficient.
""We have said that consumers have rights to 24X7
electricity
and that if there is any gratuitous load shedding, then penalties have to be levied and compensation has to be given,"" Singh said.

The minister also pointed out that while billing efficiency has gone up, collection efficiency remains stuck at 92.7 per cent.
""The average daily availability of power in rural areas has gone up from 12.5 hours in 2015-16 to about 21 hours now, and in urban areas from around 20-21 hours to 23.8 hours. Energy shortage has come down from 4.5% in 2014 to less than 1% today,"" he said.
He further said that discoms have reduced the AT&C losses of discoms from 27 per cent in 2015-16 to 15.41 per cent.
""The ACS-ARR (average cost of supply and average revenue realised) gap has gone up from 15 paise to around 45 paise, which is a cause of some concern. Load shedding still happens in some states. Load shedding is going to be history,"" the minister said.
The minister told the gathering that the energy demand of the nation is growing rapidly and that capacities will have to be added in accordance with it.
""The world is evolving in ways which are challenging. After 2030, it will be difficult to install thermal capacity. So, we have to transition fast.""
""If discoms are not viable, investments will not come, capacities will not be set up, we will not have energy for our growth, we will not be able to pay for electricity, and then, India will never become a developed country. Power regulators or discoms found to be violating the Electricity Act will be prosecuted, we are not going to stop till we make this system viable,"" he warned.
The Minister asked the states to follow the laws and various rules in order to ensure the viability of the power sector else they will not get any power from the Centre. They will also find difficult to get any loan from
PFC
or REC.
""If there is any instance of tariff not being up-to-date, tariff not being cost-reflective, or subsidy not being paid, requisite action under the law will be taken. And because we have laid down all these provisions in the law, the concerned people will be prosecuted. We are not going to stop till we make this system viable, till we make India a developed country,"" the Minister said.
The two-day RPM meeting will discuss matters pertaining to distribution, rooftop solar, green hydrogen, green appliances, PM KUSUM, Rights of Consumer Rules, stage-wise review for projects planned for up to 2029-30, viability of DISCOMs, state-wise review of progress under Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), state-wise stability of power supply and state-wise detail of steps taken to meet the demand and Resource adequacy, among other.

Jindal Power bids higher than Adani company for Lanco Amarkantak Power,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/jindal-power-bids-higher-than-adani-co-for-lanco-subsidiary/articleshow/106907410.cms,17-01-2024,"Naveen Jindal-promoted

Power (
JPL
) Tuesday gave a ₹4,203-crore, all-cash offer for acquiring
Lanco Amarkantak
Power, topping
Adani Power
's ₹4,100 crore offer, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Last week, JPL sought the
bankruptcy
court's approval to participate in the sale process of Lanco Amarkantak. On Friday, the Amaravati bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) directed JPL to submit a plan by Tuesday (January 16) to lenders along with a ₹100-crore
bank
guarantee. The NCLT will hear Wednesday JPL's petition whether it can participate in the sale process.
The tribunal, last week, allowed lenders to hold a fresh auction for the sale of Lanco Amarkantak, taking cognisance of the belated offer by Adani Power made after majority lenders had approved a plan by a Power
Finance
Corporation-led consortium.
JPL appealed to the tribunal last week that wider participation from bidders will improve recovery for lenders, said the people cited above.
""Adani itself gave a belated offer that is 36% higher than that offered by
PFC
. This shows that there is merit in allowing Jindal,"" said a legal expert.

JPL officials did not respond to ET's request for comment.
If the tribunal permits, it will be the second instance wherein Adani Power will clash with JPL to acquire a distressed thermal power company.
Both companies participated in the Coastal Energen auction process that lasted two days and involved intense bidding. Adani Power emerged the winning bidder, offering ₹3,440 crore, as reported by ET on October 23.
ET Bureau
In the case of Lanco Amarkantak, at an auction in December 2022, only the PFC-led consortium participated. Adani and
Reliance
, which had made initial offers of ₹2,950 crore and ₹2,103 crore, respectively, did not participate in the auction, alleging violations in the sale process.
PFC's plan offering ₹3,020 crore was approved by 95% of lenders and was pending before the tribunal for approval. PFC and
REC
jointly hold 41% of the
debt
in the power company. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) does not prevent debtholders from bidding for a company.
Subsequently, Adani Power gave an unsolicited improved offer of ₹3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2. It later improved the offer to ₹4,100 crore, ET reported on December 13.
Lanco Amarkantak's first phase, which is fully operational, has two units of 300 MW each. The second phase, under construction, comprises two units of 600 MW each. It has ₹1,800 crore cash in the company solely on account of operations from the first phase.
KPMG-backed RP Saurabh Kumar has admitted ₹14,632 crore of claims from 17 lenders.

R K
Singh on Tuesday said the
power sector
has witnessed transformational changes in the last nine years. Inaugurating the
Indian Electrical and Electronics
Manufacturers' Association's (IEEMA) flagship event BID 2024 here, the
power
minister said the central government has a huge ambition in terms of energy transition and plans to have 500 GW of non-fossil-based electricity installed capacity by 2030.
""In the past nine years, we have brought great transformational changes in our industry, transforming the power sector from being power-deficient to power-sufficient. In the last nine years, with the addition of 1,90,700 ckm (which is about 65 per cent increase), the transmission network of 4,79,185 ckm (circuit kilometre) has evolved as the largest national synchronous grid in the world,"" Singh said.
He also that the total inter-regional power transmission capacity has increased to 1,16,540 MW, more than double in nine years.
""We have set a huge ambition in energy transition and plan to have 500 GW of non-fossil-based electricity installed capacity by 2030,"" he added.
The government has an installed renewable energy capacity of 1,79,570 MW (43 per cent of the total capacity) and another 99,000 MW is under installation, the minister said.

captive power generators
and consumers having minimum 25 kW of load for
interstate transmission
and
energy storage systems
to establish, operate and maintain dedicated transmission lines without the requirement of licence.
The power ministry has amended the Electricity Rules to allow the exemption. The new rules also apply to consumers having a minimum 10 kW load for intrastate transmission systems.
Doing away with the requirement of licence for dedicated transmission lines for industry will lead to
ease of doing business
for the industry, power minister RK Singh said on Monday. This will help industries, especially the
green hydrogen industry
, which need
renewable energy
with dedicated transmission lines.
The exemption from licence for transmission lines is already available to generating companies and captive generating stations.
The move will encourage a new category of bulk consumers to emerge, benefiting from more affordable electricity and grid reliability, the power ministry said in a statement.

To rationalise the open access charges, new rules have been prescribed for open access charges - wheeling charges, state transmission charges and additional surcharge. It said due to high open access charges levied by some state regulators the facility has not been utilised by consumers to the expected level.
The rule says that for a person taking general network access or open access, the additional surcharge will be reduced and eliminated within four years from the grant of the access.
The rationalisation of open access charges and exemption from licence will lead to faster adoption of renewable energy by the industry, Singh said.

BSES discoms, too, are geared to ensure reliable power supply for its 50 lakh consumers and around 2 crore residents during the winter, a company official said.
According to the Indian Meteorological Department, the minimum temperatures were in the range of 3-7°C over most parts of Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh-Delhi, as on December 12.
The power sector is bracing for high demand as, according to the IMD, there is likely to be a gradual fall by 2-3°C in minimum temperatures over many parts of central and east India during the next 2-3 days.
Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are very likely to continue in isolated pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi on Friday, and Saturday, the IMD said.
Since the beginning of this month, Delhi’s peak power demand has risen by over 11%. Barring January 2, Delhi’s peak power demand in January has remained above 5,000 MW.

Jindal Power may join race to buy Lanco Amarkantak,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/jindal-power-proposes-to-top-adanis-bid-for-coal-power-plant-sources/articleshow/106759623.cms,13-01-2024,"Jindal Power Ltd (JPL) is seeking to compete with Reliance Industries,
Adani Power
and a Power Finance Corp-led consortium to acquire Lanco Amarkantak Power with the Naveen Jindal-promoted company expressing its interest in bidding for the distressed power producer.
JPL has filed a petition with the Amaravati bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for approval to join the auction process of Lanco Amarkantak Power, said people with knowledge of the matter.
At a hearing on Friday, the NCLT permitted JPL to submit a resolution plan along with a Rs 100 crore bank guarantee. The tribunal will hear JPL’s plea again on Wednesday.
JPL did not respond to ET’s request for comments.
The development comes soon after the tribunal allowed lenders to hold a fresh auction following Adani Power's belated offer after lenders concluded voting for company.

If the tribunal allows Jindal to join the auction, it will be the second instance wherein Adani Power will clash with JPL for acquiring a distressed thermal power company.
Both companies participated in the Coastal Energen auction process that lasted two days and involved intense bidding. Adani Power emerged as the winning bidder, offering Rs 3,440 crore, as reported by ET on October 23.
In the case of Lanco Amarkantak, the lenders sought special approval from the tribunal to hold a fresh auction. This is because in January, nearly 95% of the lenders voted for a resolution plan by a consortium led by PFC that is also pending before the tribunal for approval. PFC had offered Rs 3,020 crore plan to the lenders.
Subsequently, Adani Power gave an unsolicited improved offer of Rs 3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2. It later improved the offer to Rs 4,100 crore, as reported by ET on December 13.
Adani's revised offer was 36% higher than PFC-led consortium's plan.
Last week, following a plea from lenders, the tribunal allowed the resolution professional to hold a fresh auction among the three original bidders- Reliance Industries, Adani Power and Power Finance Corporation (PFC) led consortium.
On Friday, JPL petitioned that since lenders are holding a fresh auction, it should also be allowed to participate in the bidding process. JPL argued that competition will improve recovery for lenders, which is the stated objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
Lanco Amarkantak's first phase, which is fully operational, has two units of 300 MW each, while the second phase is under construction and comprises two units of 600 MW each. It has Rs 1,800 crore cash in the company solely on account of operations from the first phase.
KPMG-backed RP Saurabh Kumar has admitted Rs 14,632 crore of claims from 17 lenders.

NCLAT has dismissed the

of
Jindal Power
to allow the company to participate in the ongoing resolution process of debt-ridden
Tuticorin Coal Terminal
. A two-member bench of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) upheld the earlier order passed by the Mumbai Bench of NCLT, which said that under CIRP Regulations, Jindal Power Ltd (JPL) was ""ineligible to submit a Resolution Plan"" for Tuticorin Coal Terminal.

The appellate tribunal said the process prescribed in the IBC asks for maximisation of the value, but it cannot give a go-by to the existing specific CIRP Regulations, which prevent the entry of companies that are not in the final list of prospective resolution applicants.
The
NCLAT
further directed the resolution professional and the Committee of Creditors (COC) to decide on the
bid
received from Seapol.
""We do not find merit in the present Appeal, which if allowed would mean contravention and violation of Regulation...The Appeal is, therefore, dismissed,"" said the NCLAT.
""RP and COC should proceed with its CIR proceedings and decide the resolution plan available with them either way,"" it added.

JPL had challenged the August 2023 order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which said JPL was ""ineligible"" as the CIRP Regulations prevented it from submitting any bids midway.
Earlier, the NCLT had allowed JPL to participate in the resolution process, but it held the company ineligible as its name was not in the final list of resolution applicants.
Earlier, the RP of Tuticorin Coal Terminal had filed for liquidation of the company as creditors failed to find a buyer. However, a firm Seahawk expressed its interest and the opportunity was granted but it did not file any resolution plan.
Around the same time Seapol, which was on the final list of selected prospective resolution applicants, also approached NCLT. After this, the liquidation application was withdrawn. Seapol submitted its plan on February 18, 2023.
While the lenders were considering Seapol's plan, JPL on July 12, 2023, sent an EoI (Expression of Interest) for Tuticorin Coal Terminal, showing its interest in participating in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP).
The NCLT allowed it to participate and submit the Resolution Plan to maximise its value. However, it said this opportunity shall be subject to compliance with the provisions contained in CIRP regulations.
However, as there was a contradiction in the NCLT order on the one hand, it allowed submission of the resolution plan by JPL for maximisation, but on the other hand, it sought compliance with the CIRP Regulations, and the RP requested clarification from the tribunal.
The NCLT clarification order disallowed JPL to submit a resolution plan for the Tuticorin Coal Terminal.
This was challenged before the NCLAT, claiming that the intent of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was to maximise the value of the assets of the corporate debtor.
However, the NCLAT said, ""No doubt the whole process prescribed in the Code and supported by Regulations aims at maximisation of the value for the Corporate Debtor but it cannot give a go by to the existing specific Regulations"".
It further said Resolution plans, which enter midway and which were not in the final list, can ""derail and delay the CIRP proceedings"".
Tuticorin Coal Terminal is a company, formed as a special purpose vehicle, engaged in the business of development of North Cargo Berth II for handling bulk cargo at Tuticorin Port.
In 2019, CIRP was initiated against it over the plea filed by Bank of India, its largest financial creditor.

"India plans to double its coal production, but it ignores climate threat",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-plans-to-double-its-coal-production-but-it-ignores-climate-threat/articleshow/106667197.cms,09-01-2024,"As climate diplomats at COP28 in Dubai debated an agreement to transition away from
fossil fuels
last December,
India
was facing another
energy conundrum
: It needed to build more power capacity, fast.
“To meet growing demand,” the Indian government said on Dec. 11 it expects to roughly double
coal production
, reaching 1.5 billion tons by 2030. Later, the power minister Raj Kumar Singh set out plans on Dec. 22 to add 88 gigawatts of thermal power plants by 2032. The vast majority of which will burn coal.
The move to invest more in the world’s dirtiest fuel – one of the biggest contributors to global warming – may seem counterintuitive for the South Asian country, which is highly vulnerable to climate impacts. Yet, as the country heads into elections during April and May, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
is keen to avoid any risks of power shortages. Along with record heat waves India has seen big spikes in peak demand for electricity over two successive years.
“India’s policy is to build everything. Push for renewables, but also push for coal and other fossil fuels,” said Sandeep Pai, director of the climate-focused organization Swaniti Global. “The justification is an increase in power demand.”
When it comes to renewable energy, however, India is failing to build enough to meet its ambitious goal of 500 gigawatts of clean-energy capacity by 2030. The rates at which solar and wind power was installed over the past few years is about a third of what’s needed, according to BloombergNEF.

There is a combination of factors affecting the renewables roll out. The top reasons, says Rohit Gadre of BNEF, are the misaligned incentives of state-owned electricity retailers, difficulty of acquiring the land necessary and lack of consistent policies at federal and state levels. As a result, even as the demand for power is rising, there’s not enough appetite among private investors to speed up renewable investments.
That is not to say things will be smooth for coal either, which is facing similar challenges in attracting new investment. “Solar and wind power plants can be built quickly, whereas coal power plants will take much longer and at higher costs,” said Vibhuti Garg, South Asia director for the non-profit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
Neither Pai nor Gadre expect India to reach the coal targets it has set. BNEF’s economic-transition scenario sees India’s coal use topping out at 1.1 billion tons before 2040.
Ultimately, India needs investment in its energy infrastructure as the lower middle-income country seeks economic growth. Per capita electricity consumption for India is far below those of developed countries or even China. And India is still far from using up its fair-share of the global carbon budget.
India, as well as other big developing countries, also need more incentives to choose a greener path. Over the last three years, the Group of Seven nations have designed the Just Energy Transition Partnership to help South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia to reduce coal use. Those deals have been messy and yet to show results.
While the world may have agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at COP28, it hasn’t found effective ways to help countries like India replace coal, environment minister Bhupendra Yadav suggested this week at a launch for a book titled Modi Energising A Green Future. That doesn’t have to be simply about rich countries handing out cash, he said at the event, but better policies, technology transfer and skills training are also needed.
Pai echoed this view. “The world needs to offer something to India to not carbonize,” he said. “The main challenge is the world really doesn’t offer much to India or to any developing country.”

Proposed tariff regulations support new power-sector investments: S&P,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/proposed-tariff-regulations-support-new-power-sector-investments-sp/articleshow/106664823.cms,09-01-2024,"New Delhi: The proposed
power-tariff review
regulations for the five-year tariff period starting FY25 support new
power-sector investments
and
credit profiles
of entities in the sector, S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday.
The assured regulated returns with full cost pass-through continue as the
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
in the draft
tariff regulations
kept the return on equity for thermal units unchanged at 15.5%.
“We anticipate only slight changes to credit metrics versus those assumed under the previous five-year control period” the ratings agency said.
The regulations apply to regulated entities for cost-plus-based tariff determination.
However, the CERC proposed to slash the return on equity for new transmission projects commissioned after April 2024 by 50 basis points to 15%.

""The proposed lower return on equity for new transmission lines…will not move the needle much,"" said credit analyst Rachna Jain. ""A 50 basis-point reduction in ROE reduces a regulated project's earnings after tax by about 3%, but EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, by only about 1%.""
Most transmission projects in India are anyways now awarded through tariff-based competitive bidding, Jain said.
The stable availability-based regulatory rate of return with full cost pass-through underpins Power Grid Corp of India, NTPC and NHPC’s strong cash-flow predictability, the report said.
The well-established regulatory framework with a long record continues to support the regulated assets of the issuers.
The regulator’s proposal to increase return on equity to 17% from 16.5% for new storage-type hydro power projects, pumped-storage hydro projects reflect operators' risk and will spur investment, the agency said.
Thermal projects will also benefit from additional incentive income at 1% of annual fixed-revenue requirements.
The equivalent extra incentive income for hydro generation projects will be 4%, the agency said.
Thermal assets will also receive a peak-period incentive at 75 paise/unit against 65 paise/unit, as per the draft regulations.
In setting the tariff structure, the regulator's assumed 6% annual escalation in operation and maintenance expense over the next five years mitigates inflation risk. The equivalent cost increase over the prior control period was 4% to 5%, the agency said.

Tuticorin Coal Terminal: NCLAT dismisses plea by Jindal Power,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/tuticorin-coal-terminal-nclat-dismisses-plea-by-jindal-power/articleshow/106646338.cms,09-01-2024,"National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Monday dismissed an
appeal
by
Jindal Power
Limited against Mumbai National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) ruling that disallowed the company from submitting a
resolution plan
in
Tuticorin Coal Terminal
's
insolvency process
.
The appellate tribunal said they didn't find any merits in the appeal and allowing it would violate the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) regulation while dismissing the appeal.
Jindal Power wanted to be considered as an applicant for the
acquisition
of insolvent Tuticorin Coal Terminal Pvt Ltd. The NCLT had allowed Jindal Power to participate in resolution process only if its name appeared in final list of Prospective Resolution Applicants (PRA) prepared by the Committee of Creditors (CoC).
Jindal Power had argued that another company, Seapol, was allowed to submit a resolution plan, even though its name had not appeared on the final list of PRA prepared by the CoC and wanted the same right to be extended to it.
The NCLAT had observed in its previous hearing that if Jindal Power is allowed to submit a resolution plan, it will also have to ask other entities interested in taking control of the insolvent company to submit fresh resolution plans. Tuticorin Coal Terminal was admitted to insolvency in February 2020.

's ₹4,100 crore unsolicited offer for
Lanco Amarkantak Power
will be the anchor bid for the proposed auction to sell the distressed thermal company, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Reliance Industries
and a consortium led by
Power Finance Corporation
(
PFC
) are the other two bidders participating in the auction process, the people cited above said.
Last January, 95% of lenders approved a ₹3,020 crore plan offered by the PFC-led consortium, and the resolution professional applied for approval from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
Thereafter, Adani Power gave an unsolicited improved offer of ₹3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2. The offer was later sweetened to ₹4,100 crore, as reported by ET on December 13.
Adani's latest offer is 36% higher than the lender-approved plan given by the PFC-led consortium.

The RP invited lenders to vote on whether to consider Adani's unsolicited offer since he has already filed an application with the NCLT. In the last week of December, lenders unanimously voted to consider the offer.
KPMG-backed RP Saurabh Kumar Tikmani has applied to the NCLT seeking direction on holding an auction with Adani's offer as an anchor bid. The tribunal is scheduled to hear the matter on January 16.
At an auction in December 2022, Only the PFC-led consortium participated, offering ₹3,020 crore. Adani and Reliance, which had made initial offers of ₹2,950 crore and ₹2,103 crore, respectively, did not participate in the auction, alleging violations in the sale process.
Since all lenders, including PFC and
REC
, have voted on a proposal to restart the auction process, it gives a big boost to Adani.
This is because PFC and REC jointly hold 41% of the debt in the power company, and its consortium emerged as a successful resolution applicant.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code does not prevent debtholders from bidding for a company. Anyone with over 34% debt can block a resolution; conversely, a plan is approved if 66% of lenders vote in favour.
Thus, as 41% debtholders, PFC and REC enjoyed veto power in the resolution of the power producer.
Lanco Amarkantak's first phase, which is fully operational, has two units of 300 MW each, while the second phase is under construction and comprises two units of 600 MW each.

Former J&K chief minister
Mehbooba Mufti
said that at a time when the UT is facing a

Ratle Hydro Electric Power Corporation Limited, a joint venture between the
NHPC
Limited and JK State Power Development Corporation, has entered into a power purchase agreement with the Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services Limited for 850 MW sourcing from the project in Kishtwar district of Jammu division. The agreement has been signed for the off-take of power for a period of 40 years.
The agreement was signed in Jaipur on January 3.
""Ruling government should clear the air on this agreement...normally power purchase agreements usually last for a maximum of 20 years. However in this case they are signing it for 40 years at a pre-negotiated price which is also unknown,"" said Imran Dar, NC spokesperson . He further said that there has been a feeling of betrayal amongst the people of J&K that their resources are being bartered away.
Live Events
The NC demanded that the government should bring out a white paper on the agreement informing people about its underlying purpose and what benefits will J&K reap from it. ""For electricity starved people of J&K it makes no sense that at a time when J&K is grappling with an electricity crisis, the government is selling out electricity to other states,"" said Dar.

DRI
) to look into the allegations of
over-invoicing
of
equipment
by
Adani Power
will not apply till the Supreme Court decided a review petition filed in a related case.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
A Division bench comprising justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna noted that Adani Power’s submissions that the department (revenue) has filed a review in the SC. “Accordingly, till then, direction given in paragraph 52 (directing the
CBI
to look into over invoicing allegations) shall not be applicable in case of Adani Power,” it said.
A review petition filed by the Revenue department against dismissal of its appeal last year is pending before the apex court. The case relates to the import of equipment/machinery by Adani Power Maharashtra and Adani Power Rajasthan (now both firms merged into Adani Power). The SC had last year upheld the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence’s order dropping investigations against the two companies.
According to the company, so far as the investigation/preliminary enquiries (PR) being initiated against its entities was concerned, the HC had earlier recorded the CBI’s stand that the PE initiated against various companies and unknown officials of some PSU banks was closed in July 2015 on jurisdiction issue and the CBI chose not to challenge the closure. “Therefore, even the PE against the Adani entities/Adani Power stands closed,” the application stated.
The HC order came on an application filed by Adani Power seeking recall of the HC’s December 19 order that directed the CBI and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence to meticulously and expeditiously look into the allegations of over invoicing of coal imports and equipment by various companies including, Adani Group and Essar Group, to unearth actual factual position and take appropriate actions against the erring companies take appropriate actions in accordance with the law.

“The order has violated the principles of natural justice as the court proceeded to hear the matter without impleading it, who is a necessary party to the present proceedings,” senior counsel Rajiv Nayyar, appearing for Adani Power, told the HC, adding that the original petitioners had failed to make Adani Power a party and got orders behind its back.
The company further argued that if it was made a party, it could have presented correct facts with documents and sought dismissal of the petitions. “It is a settled position of law that the concepts of necessary and proper parties is an accepted norm of civil law and the principles relating to the same can safely be applied to the proceedings before any tribunal,” Adani said in its recall application.
The high court has been hearing PILs – one by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation and Common Cause, and the other by Harsh Mander seeking a probe by Special Investigating Agency into reports of DRI against various private power generating companies for over invoicing carried out by them. Mander had also sought the CBI probe in respect of over invoicing in power projects or to set up a SIT under a retired Supreme Court judge.
DRI had earlier told the HC that show cause notices have been issued in all cases of imports of capital goods/power equipment wherein investigation was carried out and also that some cases are pending adjudication and in some cases appeals have been filed. Letters Rogatory to Overseas Courts in Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, Switzerland & Indonesia to gather evidence and documents have been issued, however, since the process is time consuming and multiple countries are involved, all necessary steps have been taken by the DRI for expeditious completion of the same.
However, the petitioners argued that modus operandi adopted by the firms is that though the coal or equipment are shipped directly to India, however, the invoicing had been routed through a different company incorporated abroad, which is directly owned and controlled by the promoters of the project in India.

CCI approves Punjab State Power Corp’s takeover of GVK Energy arm,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/cci-clears-punjab-state-power-corps-purchase-of-gvk-power-project/articleshow/106491979.cms,02-01-2024,"The
Competition Commission of India
(CCI) on Tuesday said it has cleared the proposed
acquisition
of a 100% stake in an arm of GVK Energy by
Punjab State Power Corporation
Ltd (PSPCL).
The anti-trust regulator said PSPCL, a fully owned undertaking of the Punjab government, intends to take over
GVK Power
(
Goindwal Sahib
), which has been undergoing an insolvency resolution process.
PSPCL has reportedly offered Rs 1,400 crore to lenders for the acquisition of the GVK power unit. This is the first such takeover of a private electricity generator by a state-run distribution company.
“The proposed combination relates to the Resolution Plan involving 100% acquisition of the GVK Power (Goindwal Sahib) Limited by PSPCL once it is declared as the successful resolution applicant,” the CCI said in a statement.
Incorporated in December 1997, GVK Power (Goindwal Sahib) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GVK Energy, which in turn is an arm of GVK Power and Infrastructure. It is engaged in power generation through a coal-based
thermal power plant
having a capacity of 540 megawatt, the regulator said.

India's power consumption dips marginally by 2.3 pc to 119.07 billion units in Dec,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-dips-marginally-by-2-3-pc-to-119-07-billion-units-in-dec/articleshow/106459457.cms,02-01-2024,"The country's
power consumption
dipped 2.3 per cent to 119.07 Billion Units (BU) in December, marking its first monthly decline in eight months due to lower demand for
heating equipment
, especially in the north, on account of
mild winter
, according to government data. Earlier in April 2023, power consumption had dipped nearly 1.5 per cent to 130.08 BU compared to 132.02 BU in the year-ago period. In December 2022, power consumption stood at 121.91 BU, higher than 109.17 BU recorded in the same month a year ago, the data showed.
The peak power demand met -- the highest supply in a day -- rose to 213.62 GW in December. The peak power supply stood at 205.10 GW in December 2022 and 189.24 GW in December 2021.
Experts said that power consumption as well as demand remained lower due to mild winters in the first fortnight of December. However, consumption and demand rose after mercury dipped sharply in the second half of the month, especially in North
India
.
The data showed that peak power demand touched 213.62 GW on December 29. It was recorded as low as 174.16 GW on December 3. It crossed the 200 GW mark on December 14, 2023, when it stood at 200.56 GW.
The power ministry had estimated the country's electricity demand to touch 229 GW during the summer. The demand did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rains.

The peak supply, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July. Peak demand touched 238.82 GW in August. In September 2023, it was 243.27 GW. The peak demand was 222.16 GW in October and 204.86 GW in November 2023.
Industry experts said power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June this year due to widespread rainfall. They said power consumption grew in August, September, and October, mainly due to humid weather conditions, and also a pick up in industrial activities ahead of the festive season.
Experts are expecting steady power consumption growth in the coming months due to an improvement in economic activities and an increase in the severity of winter.

Arunachal Pradesh signs MoA with THDCIL for 1200 MW Kalai-II hydroelectric project,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/arunachal-pradesh-signs-moa-with-thdcil-for-1200-mw-kalai-ii-hydroelectric-project/articleshow/106407025.cms,30-12-2023,"Guwahati: The Government of
Arunachal Pradesh
signed a
Memorandum of Agreement
(
MoA
) with
Tehri Hydropower Development Corporation India Ltd
(THDCIL), a
central PSU
, for developing the 1200 MW
Kalai-II hydroelectric project
in the
Lohit river basin
.
Ankur Garg, Commissioner (Hydropower) and Bhupender Gupta, Director (Technical) THDCIL, signed the MoA on behalf of the Govt of Arunachal Pradesh and M/s THDCIL respectively.
Earlier in August this year, the State Government had signed MoAs with three central PSUs -
NHPC Ltd
, SJVN Ltd and
NEEPCO Ltd
for developing 12 (twelve)
hydropower projects
with a combined capacity of 11,517 MW to be developed in Subansiri, Dibang and Siang basins.
With the allotment of Kalai-II project to THDCIL, the state has thus concluded MoAs for 13 projects with a total capacity of 12,717 MW in this calendar year. Kalai-II project was initially allotted to an independent power developer in 2009 but remained stalled due to various reasons. To unlock this potential, the Central and the State Governments made joint and concerted efforts over the last two years and the award of this project to THDCIL today will help restart its execution. This is the first project to be allotted to a central PSU in the Lohit basin and is also the first project to be taken up by Ms THDCIL in the state.
Ankur Garg, Commissioner (Hydropower) said that the project will bring in investment of over Rs. 13,000 Crore in the state during its construction phase. Once commissioned, it will generate over Rs. 300 Crore annually in free power revenue for the state and about Rs. 25 Crore annually for the Local Area Development Fund.
Live Events
The Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein conveyed that the project will create historic development and employment opportunities in the Lohit basin area. It will be developed in partnership with the State Government which will have a 26% equity share. The dividends from this equity participation will further augment the State’s earnings from the projects.
The Chief Minister Pema Khandu thanked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union Power Minister R. K. Singh for unflinching support towards restarting the project. He expressed that the state is committed to ensuring full development of the hydropower potential for meeting the energy security of the country and asked all the stakeholders to implement the project in a mission mode.

With this, Sterlite Power now has Rs 14,000 crore of projects under management.
""Enabling part of 7.7 GW of green power flow, the Neemrana II Kotputli Transmission project is another vital cog in the machine that will accelerate the nation's transition to a sustainable future,"" Sterlite Power Managing Director Pratik Agarwal said in the statement.
Neemrana II Kotputli Transmission will require the development of two integral components -- 6,000 MVA, 765/400kV substation at Neemrana, and two 400 kV transmission lines spanning 250 km, connecting Neemrana with the existing Kotputli substation; and another LILO corridor that will connect Neemrana II with Gurgaon and Sohna substations through the existing Gurgaon-Sohna line, as per the statement.
In March 2023, Sterlite Power won its first green energy project in Rajasthan -- Fatehgarh III Beawar Transmission Ltd (Phase III, Part G project).
This was followed by a Beawar Transmission Ltd (Phase III, Part-F) win in August 2023.
These green energy projects will entail construction of a 950-km transmission corridor across Rajasthan.
These corridors will be instrumental in the evacuation of a significant portion of 20 GW of renewable energy from Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) in Fatehgarh (9.1 GW), Bhadla (8 GW) and Ramgarh (2.9 GW), and 7.7 GW in Bikaner.
The project win adds to the overall green energy portfolio of the company, taking the total projects under management tally to nine.

Achieving 24x7 electricity supply for all in 2024: India's focus on coal and renewables,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/achieving-24x7-electricity-supply-for-all-in-2024-indias-focus-on-coal-and-renewables/articleshow/106264850.cms,25-12-2023,"NEW DELHI: India will focus on setting up more coal-fired power projects as well as keep adding
renewable generation capacity
to achieve
24x7 electricity supply
for all in 2024 amid economic expansion and the need to ensure
energy security
in these times of rising
geopolitical uncertainties
. In a reflection of ambitious plans, the
Union power ministry
has planned a whooping 91 GW of
coal-based thermal power generation capacity
entailing an investment of Rs 7.28 lakh crore over the next few years.
Talking to PTI, Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister
R K Singh
said, ""24X7 supply of power is right of the consumer. Similarly, energy security is of paramount importance for us. You have seen what happened in Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine war.""
At present, average power supply across India is 23.50 hours in urban areas and 22 hours in rural areas, he said.
Singh also said that the coal-based thermal power capacity will insulate the country from any geopolitical disruption and ensure energy security for the country at a time when our economy is expanding rapidly.
The coal-based capacity addition is also important in view of rising demand of electricity in the country as peak power demand was at an all-time high of 243.27 GW in September 2023.

India has installed power generation capacity of about 426 GW, including more than 213 GW of coal and lignite-based projects.
Earlier this month, President Droupadi Murmu said the dependence on fossil fuels is definitely decreasing but fossil fuel-based energy is also essential for the country.
India has always worked as a responsible country in the field of clean energy. India is promoting clean coal technologies so that the processes of coal extraction and use become more efficient and environment friendly, she had said at an event.
According to the 20th Electric Power Survey (EPS) report published in November 2022, peak power demand in the country will touch 366.39 GW in 2031-32, 465.53 GW in 2036-37 and 574.68 GW in 2041-42.
Explaining why renewable energy alone cannot be sufficient for round the clock power supply, Singh said that solar is available in the day and wind blows at different times.
Thus, renewables can provide round-the-clock power with energy storage only, which is expensive presently, he said.
Singh said the ministry has planned 91 GW of new coal-based thermal power generation capacity, which includes 27 GW under construction.
Around 31 GW of coal-based thermal capacity which is at an advanced stage of implementation.
Out of the total, construction would begin on 17 GW in 2024, the minister said, adding that another 33 GW thermal power capacity has also been planned.
The 17 GW thermal capacity addition entails an investment of about Rs 1.36 lakh crore at an average cost of implementation of Rs 8 crore per MW at the current prices. It works out to be USD 16.4 billion dollar at the foreign exchange rate of 83 against the dollar, as per back of the envelope calculations.
Anil Sardana, Adani Power Managing Director and Chairman of industry body CII's National Committee on Power, said that while renewable sources will continue to play a central role in the energy mix, meeting high base load demand growth will require additional thermal power capacity.
He noted that as per the Central Electricity Authority, the peak power demand is expected to soar above 256 GW in 2024.
Further, he said that the power sector, particularly in India, faces a complex set of challenges as it stands at the intersection of multi-decadal growth and transition towards becoming a developed nation.
India's ambitious growth trajectory implies a substantial increase in power demand in the coming years. Meeting the soaring demand and providing reliable electricity while adhering to renewable energy targets and a stable grid is a significant challenge, he pointed out.
Apart from round-the-clock power supply, consumers can also look forward to a new policy regime which will end monopoly in electricity distribution.
A Tata Power Delhi Distribution spokesperson said it is possible that customers may have the option to choose their electricity provider in the future, but it is uncertain whether this will happen in the near future.
""Giving a choice to select a service provider was introduced in the Electricity Amendment Bill and has been awaiting consensus since. If it does happen, it will undoubtedly be advantageous for customers,"" the spokesperson said.
About integrating electricity markets across states, PTC India Chairman and Managing Director Rajib K Mishra said 2024 could see significant progress in this direction, with the implementation of the proposed 'Market Coupling Mechanism'.
It will allow for real-time power trading across regional grids, optimising resource allocation and potentially bringing down costs for consumers, he added.
Further, he said introduction of electricity derivatives such as futures and options could provide much-needed risk management tools.
According to him, 2024 could see the development of a regulatory framework and pilot programs for these instruments, paving the way for a more mature and resilient electricity market, he added.

Almost 88 GW thermal capacity to be added to meet rising power demand: R K Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/almost-88-gw-thermal-capacity-to-be-added-to-meet-rising-power-demand-r-k-singh/articleshow/106219496.cms,22-12-2023,"New Delhi: Around 88 gigawatts (GW) of additional thermal capacity is likely to be installed in the country to meet the rising electricity demand, Union Minister
R K Singh
has said. The peak electricity demand in India is expected to touch the 3,50,670 MW mark by 2030-31, and the government is taking various measures to meet the increased demand, the power minister said on Thursday.
""As per 20th Electric Power Survey (EPS) report published in November 2022, the peak electricity demand in the country in 2030-31 is expected to be 3,50,670 MW. We have taken steps to meet the increased demand for power in the country,"" Singh said.
The minister said 27,180 MW of thermal capacity is under construction, another 12,000 MW has been bid out and 19,000 MW is under clearance. The total anticipated thermal capacity addition by 2031-2032 will be 87,910 MW.
Thus, the total capacity under construction, including thermal, renewable, hydro and nuclear, stands at 1,32,148.5 MW, while the total capacity addition by 2031-32 is likely to be 4,64,124 MW, Singh said in Lok Sabha.
Meanwhile, at an event the minister said that investment must take place in the power sector for the Indian economy to grow at 7.5 per cent.
Live Events
""Investments are required since if the economy is to grow at 7.5 per cent, our power sector needs to grow at 8.5 per cent. Every industry wants to have resources which are slightly in excess of current demand. If the peak demand today is 243 GW, then the contract demand will be in excess of 340 GW,"" a power ministry statement quoted Singh as saying.
Addressing the employees of
REC
, officers and staff of his ministry, Singh said in 2017, the power sector was in doldrums and outstanding dues of gencos were more than Rs 1.4 lakh crore. Most discoms were heavily indebted and did not have money even for buying power or for maintaining the systems.
The nation has 161 GW of electricity capacity under construction which will go up to 239 GW and that we will have 100 GW of capacity under construction consistently for the next two decades, for which REC and
PFC
will have to mobilize funds, he said.

Peak power demand likely to be 230 GW in January,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/peak-power-demand-likely-to-be-230-gw-in-january/articleshow/106134408.cms,20-12-2023,"NEW DELHI: Peak
power demand
between this month and February next year is likely to be about 6-9.5% higher year-on-year, according to an assessment by the
Grid Controller of India
, after a higher than expected power demand during the
monsoon
this year.
The projections will help prepare for some reserves and buffer capacity in case of a contingency, said officials.
Peak demand in January 2024 is projected at 230 GW, higher than 210.6 GW maximum demand met in January this year ago, while February 2024 is expected to see 222 GW peak power demand, against about 210 GW in February this year.
The December peak is projected at 220 GW, likely in the second half of the month. So far in the month, ""maximum demand met"" has reached 203 GW in the solar hours. A year ago the peak was 205 GW.
Usually in the winter months, peak demand is recorded between 9:30 and 11 am. Evening peak or non-solar hour peak for these months is predicted to be lower than daytime.
Live Events
Non-solar hours peak demand is expected at 208 GW in December and January, and 205 GW in February.
The projections have been made following the surge in August and September, when peak demand smashed records and projections, a government official told ET.
The short-term projection made by the Grid Controller of India, includes an underlying compound annual growth rate of 6%, apart from other factors, said another official.
Power demand increased substantially this year, starting August, owing to erratic weather patterns, lower rainfall and economic growth.
Peak demand reached 243 GW on September 1, surpassing projections of 231 GW for 2023, that too in April.
The March-May period saw relatively lower demand for
electricity
because of favourable weather conditions.
However, in 2024, summer weather conditions may return to the usual highs, the officials said. Meeting the projected peak demand this winter will not be a challenge as the projections are for the daytime, when
solar power
is available, they said.

India cannot do away with energy security to meet climate goals: Official,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-cannot-do-away-with-energy-security-to-meet-climate-goals-official/articleshow/106125221.cms,19-12-2023,"India cannot do away with

only because it has to meet
climate goals
, a senior official said on Tuesday. The statement assumes significance due to India's focus on energy transition with ambitious targets of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and net-zero by 2070.
India's power demand touched an all-time high of 243.27 GW in September this year. India has installed power generation capacity of about 426 GW, including over 213 GW coal and lignite based.
""We cannot do away with energy security, only because we have to meet the climatic goal,"" Special Secretary and Financial Adviser, Ministry of Power, Ashish Upadhyay, said while addressing the inaugural CII South Asia Power Summit.
Apart from India, three other countries in the region -- Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Nepal -- are participating in the summit.
""We have got huge resource of thermal (coal-based) power. Of course with due respect to all those who are talking about climate change protection and net zero emission... we have highest regard for it and are working highly for it. But for us, energy security is also important.""

Punjab Utility set to buy GVK power plant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/punjab-utility-set-to-buy-gvk-power-plant/articleshow/106103129.cms,19-12-2023,"Punjab State Power Corp
is set to acquire
GVK Power
(Goindwal Sahib) by offering ₹1,400 crore to
lenders
, people aware of the development told ET, marking the first such takeover of a private electricity generator by a state-run discom, or
distribution company
.
The
GVK
Group entity is undergoing a
corporate insolvency process
.
Last week, lenders unanimously voted on a resolution plan given by Punjab State Power Corp (PSPCL), said the people cited above. KPMG-backed resolution professional, Ravi Sethia, has filed an application with the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT) to get the plan approved.
GVK Power (Goindwal Sahib) has a 25-year power purchase agreement with PSPCL, which was also the sole bidder for the Punjab-based company.
The discom's offer would imply 21% recovery for verified lenders.
Live Events
Twelve corporates, including Adani Power, Jindal Power, and Vedanta, showed interest in acquiring the 540-MW thermal power plant spread across 1,100 acres of land in Punjab but backed out over concerns arising from a series of litigations between the private power producer and the state government over non-payment of dues.
PSPCL suffered a setback in September 2014 after the
Supreme Court
cancelled coal blocks allotted to various projects, including GVK Power. Thereafter, it made a series of attempts to enter a one-time settlement with lenders offering 27-28% recovery. However, the negotiations failed after the outbreak of Covid-19 since lenders refrained from giving new loans to distressed thermal companies.
PSPCL has withheld payments of close to ₹1,400 crore that GVK Power (Goindwal Sahib) claimed, eventually pushing the company into insolvency, said officials from the power sector.
The thermal power company has undisputed trade receivables of ₹327 crore from PSPCL and another ₹334 crore disputed trade receivables from the state utility, according to an information memorandum circulated by the RP to the potential bidders. RP, who did not respond to ET's request for comments, has admitted ₹6,584 crore in claims from 12 financial creditors.
Legal experts say the company was also a victim of politics at the state level.
In October 2021, the state government threatened to terminate the power purchase agreement with GVK citing the high tariffs charged by the power producer. The PPA's termination was part of fulfilling an election promise by the then Congress government.
The Punjab government had signed the PPA with GVK Power when the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP combine was in power earlier. The cancellation resulted in a series of litigation between the company and the state government.

(Electricite de France) has evinced interest in building six European Pressurised Reactors (EPR) at Jaitapur in Maharashtra’s Ratnagiri district. “But there continues to be disagreement over the EDF offer, including liability for accidents,” the report says.
However, at a recent conference organised by the Indian Nuclear Society at the Centre-run Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Mumbai, French officials told TOI that “talks regarding the EPRs were progressing satisfactorily with the Indian authorities, and hopefully a deal should be firmed up soon”.
According to the report, India currently has 19 operational reactors with a total generating capacity of 6.3GW (gigawatts) or 6300MW (megawatts). The share of nuclear power in India’s electricity is 3.1 per cent. It says that eight more reactors with a combined capacity of 6.0GW are being constructed.
The report points out that the 500MW Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam, near Chennai, is expected to be commissioned in December 2024, over 20 years after construction started and over 14 years past the initially initial commissioning date of September 2010. The delay has seen its cost more than double from Rs 3500 crore to Rs 7700 crore, the report adds.

Global coal demand expected to decline in coming years: IEA,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/global-coal-demand-expected-to-decline-in-coming-years-iea/articleshow/106023127.cms,15-12-2023,"After reaching an all-time high this year,
global coal demand
is expected to decline by 2026 due to a major expansion of
renewables
, according to the latest edition of the International Energy Agency's (
IEA
) annual coal market report. This is the first time that the report has predicted a drop in global coal consumption.
Around 40 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions stem from coal, while oil and gas contribute to the remaining percentage.
The report says global demand for coal rose by 1.4 per cent in 2023, mainly due to rising energy demand in emerging and developing economies, including India (8 per cent) and China (5 per cent).
Consumption is on course to decline in most advanced economies in 2023, including in the European Union and the United States (around 20 per cent each), it said.
Both the US and the EU rely more on oil and natural gas. For instance, oil and natural gas accounted for 36 per cent and 33 per cent of the total energy production in the US in 2022.

The report expects global
coal demand
to fall by 2.3 per cent by 2026 compared to 2023 levels, even in the absence of governments announcing and implementing stronger clean energy and climate policies. This decline is set to be driven by a major expansion of renewable energy capacity.
More than half of this global renewable capacity expansion is set to occur in China, which currently accounts for over half of the world's demand for coal.
As a result, coal demand in China is expected to fall in 2024 and plateau through 2026, the report said.
The projected decline in global demand for coal - which is currently the largest energy source for electricity generation, steelmaking and cement production, but also the largest source of carbon dioxide (Co2) emissions from human activity - could mark a historic turning point, the IEA said.
The use of unabated coal would need to fall significantly faster to drive down emissions at a rate consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, it said.
The term ""unabated"" generally refers to the continued use of coal, oil, and gas without efforts to curtail emissions. However, a universally accepted and precise definition of this term is currently lacking.
""We have seen declines in global coal demand a few times, but they were brief and caused by extraordinary events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union or the Covid-19 crisis. This time appears different, as the decline is more structural, driven by the formidable and sustained expansion of clean energy technologies,"" said Keisuke Sadamori, IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security.
""A turning point for coal is clearly on the horizon - though the pace at which renewables expand in key Asian economies will dictate what happens next, and much greater efforts are needed to meet international climate targets.""
Domestic coal production has long been the cornerstone of energy security policy for China and India.
At the annual UN climate conference in Dubai, nearly 200 countries clinched a breakthrough deal which calls for the world transition away from all fossil fuels, the primary reason for the climate crisis, in a fair and equitable way. Though the 21-page cover decision urged countries to accelerate efforts to phase down unabated coal power, it did not explicitly mention oil and gas.
Negotiators from the Global South said developing countries, including India and China, strongly resisted the ""targeting of coal"" during the climate talks which ended on Wednesday.
Several countries denounced the hypocrisy of some of the developed nations at COP28 for their continued expansion of fossil fuel production, despite lofty promises to combat climate change.
According to a report released in September, five global North countries - the US, Canada, Australia, Norway, and the UK - account for a significant 51 per cent of the planned expansion from new oil and gas fields through 2050.

"Lanco lenders to vote on Adani Power's ₹4,100-crore offer",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/lanco-lenders-to-vote-on-adani-powers-4100-crore-offer/articleshow/106000956.cms,14-12-2023,"Lenders of
Lanco Amarkantak Power
will soon vote on a proposal to consider
Adani Power
's ₹4100 crore unsolicited offer, said people aware of the matter. If over 66% of lenders vote in favour of this proposal, the resolution professional will apply to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking directions on the sale process, the people said.
KPMG-backed resolution professional (RP) Saurabh Kumar Tikmani will also seek direction on withdrawing the Power Finance Corporation-led consortium's resolution plan for the distressed thermal power undergoing corporate resolution.
The RP did not respond to ET's request for comments.
Lanco
Amarkantak's fully operational first phase has two units of 300 mw each while the second phase is under construction and comprises two units of 600 mw each. It has ₹1800 crore cash in the company solely on account of operations from the first phase.
Adani Power,
Reliance Industries
and the PFC-led consortium were in fray for Lanco Amarkantak. Among the three bidders, on PFC led consortium gave a bid at an auction held in December last year. They offered ₹3020 crore while Adani and Reliance, who offered ₹2,950 crore and ₹2,103 crore, respectively, did not participate citing violations in the sale process.
In January this year, 95% of lenders approved a ₹3,020 crore plan given by a PFC-led consortium and the RP made application with the NCLT to approve the PFC plan.

Adani Power gave an unsolicited improved offer of ₹3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2, and later they improved it to ₹4,100 crore as reported by ET on December 13.
""Since the NCLT has yet not approved the PFC-led consortium's resolution plan, Adani Power stands a good chance,"" said a person cited above.
If the court allows lenders to consider Adani's offer, the RP will hold an auction and invite all three bidders to participate, the people cited above said.
Adani's more significant challenge is bringing on board PFC and REC - the two lenders with 41% share in debt.
Both the debtholders are also part of the winning bidder, and with 41%, they have veto power. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) does not prevent debtholders from bidding for a company. Anyone with over 34% debt can block a resolution; conversely, a plan is approved if 66% of lenders approve it.
If PFC and REC agree to vote to consider Adani's offer, it would have crossed at least one hurdle in acquiring the company, the person cited above said. After that, the bidder's challenge would be to get lenders to arrive at a consensus on the distribution of proceeds for the resolution to conclude.
The RP has admitted ₹14,632 crore of claims from 17 lenders.

Average power purchase cost rises 71 paise/unit in FY22-23,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/average-power-purchase-cost-rises-71-paise/unit-in-fy22-23/articleshow/105996376.cms,14-12-2023,"New Delhi, Average
power purchase cost
increased by 71 paise per unit during FY22-23 due to a rise in various overheads like
transmission
and distribution rates,
Parliament
was informed on Thursday. On the rise in power cost due to increased use of imported
coal
, Union Power Minister RK Singh, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha, said, ""Average power purchase cost increased by 71 paise only between FY22 and FY23. This is because of increase in various costs - including an increase in transmission and distribution costs"".
The minister explained that with the rise in electricity demand from July 2021 onwards, the consumption of coal in thermal power plants increased.
The supply of domestic coal on a daily basis was less than consumption, which resulted in the depletion of coal stock and stocks at plants came down from 28.7 million tonnes (MT) as of June 30, 2021, to about 8.1 million tonnes (MT) as of September 30, 2021, he added.
Therefore, in December 2021, the
Ministry of Power
advised state Gencos and IPPs (independent power producers) to import (coal) at the rate of four per cent of the total requirement and central Gencos at the rate of 10 per cent during 2022-23.
During April-September 2022 (H1 of FY 2022-23), the receipt of domestic coal was about 355 MT against the consumption of 385 MT (domestic -- 359 MT + imported: 1.4X18.9 MT) - a shortage of 30 million tonnes.

The gap between the supply of domestic coal and consumption of coal was about 1.6 lakh tonnes/day during this period, he informed the House.
To improve the situation, the Ministry of Power advised Gencos on August 1, 2022, to make the decision regarding blending at their level, taking into account the domestic coal supply and stock position (need-based blending) with continuous monitoring of stock levels.
The gap between daily coal consumption and daily arrival of domestic coal ranged between 2.65 lakh tonnes to 0.5 lakh tonnes between September 2022 and January 2023, he stated.
If the imports for blending had not been made, the coal stocks in thermal power plants would have reduced to zero in September 2022 and would have continued so, leading to widespread power cuts and blackouts, he noted.
Therefore, Singh stated that the Ministry of Power advised central, state Gencos and independent power producers (IPPs) on January 9, 2023, to import coal at the rate of 6 per cent by weight to have sufficient coal stocks at their power plants for smooth operations till September 2023.
The gap between daily coal consumption and daily arrival of domestic coal increased from 1.30 lakh tonnes per day to 2.80 lakh tonnes per day between June 2023 and September 2023, he pointed out.
Therefore, the Ministry of Power advised central and state Gencos and IPPs on September 1, 2023, and October 25, 2023, to import coal through a transparent competitive procurement process for blending, he added.
In another reply to the House, he explained that the cost of generation of electricity is dependent on the share of imported coal used and the price of imported coal.
The pricing of imported coal is linked with international indices, sources of origin, and other factors like ocean freight, insurance etc, which is purely dynamic and varies with international conditions, he noted.
Also, imported coal has a high calorific value compared to domestic coal, he pointed out.
The cost of fuel, including that of imported coal, is passed into generation tariff in accordance with regulations laid down by the appropriate Electricity Regulatory Commission, Singh said.
The generation cost becomes an input for the determination of retail consumer tariff, which is again approved by the respective regulatory commission before it is passed on to the consumers, he stated.
The regulator lays down norms for various input costs and does not allow costs in excess of the norms to be passed through, he stated.
In another reply to the House, the minister said the power demand of the country is increasing rapidly because we have added 2.86 crore new consumers and because our economy is growing rapidly.
""The peak demand during the FY2013-14 was 1,35,000 MW. The peak demand during the current financial year (till November 2023) has increased to 2,43,000 MW,"" he informed the House.
The projected peak demand as per the 20th Electric Power Survey (EPS) will be 2,77,200 MW in FY2026-27 and 3,66,400 MW in FY 2031-32, he also stated.

Till October 2023, Singh said 10,47,439 million units of power were produced in India.
He also informed that about 19.79 crore pre-paid consumers' smart meters are planned to be deployed across states.
These states/UTs also plan to deploy around 52 lakh distribution transformer (DT) smart meters and 1.88 lakh feeder smart meters under the RDSS (Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme).
The scheme will continue up to FY 2025-26. The target of the scheme is to reduce AT&C losses to pan-India levels of 12-15 per cent and eliminate the ACS-ARR (Average Cost of Supply and Average Realizable Revenue ) gaps by 2024-25. This would help bring financial viability to the Discoms and improve the power sector as a whole.

Transition away from coal not happening in the near future: Govt,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/transition-away-from-coal-not-happening-in-the-near-future-govt/articleshow/105902392.cms,11-12-2023,"The transition away from
coal
is not happening in India in the foreseeable future, Parliament was informed on Monday. Although India is pushing for renewable, non-fossil-based energy, but the share of coal in the energy basket is going to remain significant in the years ahead to ensure affordable energy availability, coal and mines minister
Pralhad Joshi
said.
""In India, the transition away from coal or Just Transition is not happening in the foreseeable future,"" the minister said.
Replying to a query in the Rajya Sabha, the minister said although, in due course, some mines may close down due to exhaustion of reserves, at the same time, many new coal blocks are being operationalised to meet the growing energy demand.
""These mines are not only ensuring affordability and energy security of the nation but also providing new additional opportunities for new employment and redeployment of workers in new mines from the to-be-closed mines to ensure better livelihood and also generate indirect employment opportunities in coal regions,"" he said.
""The World Bank is implementing a technical assistance project...This is intended for the study of already closed, abandoned and to be closed mines due to resource exhaustion and geo-spatial mapping of the area,"" he added.

Adani firm raises offer for Lanco Amarkantak Power for second time,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-firm-raises-offer-for-lanco-amarkantak-power-for-second-time/articleshow/105883822.cms,13-12-2023,"MUMBAI:
Adani Power
gave a revised, improved offer of ?4,100 crore to lenders of
Lanco Amarkantak Power
, the thermal power company undergoing insolvency proceedings, said people with knowledge of the matter.
This is the second improved offer by Adani Power within six weeks, implying that it is willing to walk the extra mile to pursue lenders to sell them the distressed power company, the people said.
The company had offered Rs 3,650 crore, as reported by ET on November 2. The unsolicited offers are made almost 10-11 months after 95% of lenders voted for a plan by the
Power Finance Corp
(PFC) led consortium.
Adani Power did not respond to ET's request for comment.
Live Events
""Yet, Adani Power has a chance because the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) has not endorsed PFC led consortium's Rs 3,020 crore resolution plan,"" one of the persons cited above, said.
""But it could be challenging, since two debtholders are also part of the winning bidder's consortium. PFC and
REC
- both part of the consortium- jointly hold 41% of the debt in Lanco Amarkantak, and their consent is imperative for Adani,"" the same person added.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) does not prevent debtholders from bidding for a company. Anyone with over 34% debt can block a resolution; conversely, a plan is approved if 66% of lenders approve it.
“The revised offer is probably aimed to lure them, as with 41%, they have a veto power,” the person cited above said.
Even if they agree, securing consent from other lenders may be difficult. The company has Rs 1800 crore cash balance, revenues generated solely from the operations of the two 300 mw units of phase one.
As per the terms of the RFRP, the cash in the company will be given to the winning bidder, which in turn lowers the acquisition cost. For instance, if Adani’s Rs 4100 crore offer is accepted, it will have to cough up Rs 2300 crore since Rs 1800 crore is lying in the company.
Lanco Amarkantak’s first phase, which is fully operational, has two units of 300 mw each, while the second phase is under construction and comprises two units of 600 mw each.
Besides, the resolution would likely take another six to eight months to conclude. During this time the cash in the company will improve, further reducing the acquisition cost for the buyer.
In the next committee of creditors meeting, lenders may ask bidders to improve their offers.
Adani and Reliance Industries were also in the fray to acquire Lanco Amarkantak, offering Rs 2950 crore and Rs 2103 crore, respectively.
The KPMG-backed resolution professional Saurabh Kumar Tikmani held an auction among bidders for price discovery, but Adani and Reliance did not participate, citing a violation in the sale process, as reported by ET on December 1, 2022. The PFC consortium emerged as a successful bidder.
The RP has admitted Rs 14,632 crore of claims from 17 lenders.
Lenders restarted the sale of Lanco Amarkantak despite Vedanta making the highest offer of Rs 2800 crore. Lenders rejected Vedanta’s offer since most of the payment was from cash in the company.

"Can't phase out coal power until storage, tech viable: Power Ministry",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/cant-phase-out-coal-power-until-storage-tech-viable-power-ministry/articleshow/105883638.cms,10-12-2023,"New Delhi: Diverting focus away from reduction of
emissions
to singling out a particular
fossil fuel
like
coal
will undermine the fight for reduction of emissions, the power ministry said while giving its view on an initiative to phase out unabated coal to be proposed at
COP28
, said people with knowledge of the matter.
In its view sent around the beginning of United Nations' annual
climate change conference
to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, which is leading the discussions at COP28 in Dubai, the power ministry cleared its stance on coal power, stating that until storage and abatement technologies become a viable option, phasing out of the fuel cannot be agreed to, said the people. The power ministry said what should matter is which country is emitting how much, on a per capita basis, whatever be the source of their emissions, according to the response, a copy of which was seen by ET.
India refrained from signing the Global
Renewable Energy
and Energy Efficiency Pledge at COP28 aimed at tripling renewable energy capacity to at least 11,000 GW by 2030.
India was a strong force behind the G20's New Delhi declaration in September which adopted a similar text, but the COP28 pledge had a caveat that aimed for phasing down of unabated coal power.

""Phasing down or phasing out of unabated coal cannot be agreed to till the time storage and abatement technologies become viable,"" said one of the persons cited earlier, who did not wish to be identified.
More than 50% of India's electricity needs are met by coal-based power plants. India needs stable and affordable sources of energy, as its energy demand is continuously growing and is expected to reach a peak of 335 GW by 2030.
The country does have ambitious targets for adding clean energy capacities. It is aiming for 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and has laid out a trajectory to bid out 50 GW of such capacity every year for five years from this financial year.
India is committed to achieving its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) commitment of having 50% share of non-fossil fuel installed electricity capacity by 2030. It expects the share of non-fossil fuels to surpass NDCs and have around 65% in the total installed capacity by 2030, the ministry said. However, renewable energy is not available round the clock, it said.
The power ministry said to make power affordable and available round the clock and to avoid any scenario of load shedding in future, India will need to add 80 GW of thermal capacity by 2032 while pursuing an increased share of renewables in the energy mix.
Earlier India was expecting this capacity to be 50 GW, but it was increased by 30 GW amid growing demand in the country and it is expected to rise further.
The ministry said that instead of pushing developing countries to cut their emissions, the developed countries need to accelerate their mitigation efforts to allow a fair share of remaining carbon space to be available to developing countries.

has increased by nearly nine per cent to 1,099.90 billion units (BU) in the country during April-November this fiscal compared to the same period a year ago, showing a surge in
economic activities
. The power consumption in the country was 1,010.20 BU in April-November 2022-23, higher than 916.52 BU recorded in the same period of 2021-22.
Power consumption in the entire fiscal 2022-23 was 1,504.26 BU, higher than 1,374.02 BU witnessed in 2021-22 financial year.
Industry experts said that around nine per cent growth in power consumption in the first eight months of this fiscal year shows buoyancy in the economy.
The
power ministry
had estimated the country's electricity demand to touch 229 GW during summer. The demand did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rain.
The peak demand, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July. Peak demand touched 238.82 GW in August. In September this year, it was at a record high of 243.27 GW. The peak demand was 222.16 GW in October and 204.86 GW in November this year.
Live Events
According to experts, power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June this year due to widespread rainfall.
They said power consumption grew in August, September, and October, mainly due to humid weather conditions and also perk up in industrial activities due to the effect of festive rush.
Earlier this week,
Union Power Minister
R K Singh had told
Lok Sabha
in a written reply that the power demand has gone up by 50.8 per cent in energy terms from 2013-14 to 2022-23.
The peak power demand has gone up from 136 GW in 2013-14 to 243 GW in September 2023, he informed the House.
""We have been able to meet the increase in demand because we added 194 GW of capacity between 2014 to 2023,"" he had explained.

NTPC had acquired 35.47 per cent of the equity share capital of RGPPL without notification to the CCI, increasing its stake from 25.51 per cent to 60.98 per cent.
Later, CCI on October 27, 2022, issued a notice or failure to notify the transaction under combination regulation. CCI was of the opinion that the transaction in question was a notifiable transaction.
However, NTPC had submitted that the acquisition of an additional 35.47 per cent stake in RGPPL was a part of the resolution plan for the settlement of the outstanding debt of RGPPL. Moreover, the final goal of the said transaction was not to acquire equity shares or control, but to settle RGPPL's debt.
NTPC also did not acquire any additional rights and enjoys joint control in RGPPL along with GAIL and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd even on consummation of the transaction, said PSU.
However, rejecting this, CCI held that by failure to notify the transaction before its consummation has resulted in violation of provisions of Section 6(2) of the Competition Act and therefore, is liable to a penalty under Section 43A of the Competition Act and imposed a fine of Rs 40 lakh.
This was subsequently challenged by NTPC before NCLAT.

Mahanadi Coalfields mulls higher capacity at Odisha thermal plant,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/mahanadi-coalfields-mulls-higher-capacity-at-odisha-thermal-plant/articleshow/105821036.cms,08-12-2023,"NEW DELHI:
Coal India
subsidiary
Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd
may expand its upcoming thermal power plant in Odisha's Sundargarh district by adding 2400 MW in phase-II, taking the total capacity of the unit to 4,000 MW.
The first phase of the project, of 1,600 MW, is likely to start work in the next financial year and be commissioned in 2028.
The land for the project was earlier allotted for the
Bedabahal
ultra mega power project of 4,000 MW, which was eventually scrapped, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
MCL then acquired the land from PFC Consulting Ltd amid lack of interest from any other thermal generating company, they said.
""There is definitely a demand for the project. Interest for almost 3200 MW has been received so far. But the company may first look to complete phase-I,"" said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.

Thermal capacity additions are being pushed by the government after a long hiatus as the country's demand has been increasingly sharply and is likely to grow in the future.
Thermal energy was written off a few years ago, which was premature, power minister RK Singh had said in November. Thermal cannot be written off until energy storage becomes viable, he had said.
Thermal power is going to stay until energy storage becomes cost-effective for round-the-clock supply through renewable energy, the minister said.
Non-solar hours are going to be a serious challenge, considering growing power demand and weather events like the one in August this year, he said.
August saw lower rainfall and higher-than-normal temperatures in many places.
Electricity demand has risen sharply this year, with energy consumed in August registering a 16.3% year-on-year growth, September 10.3% and October 21%.
The power ministry increased its projection of thermal capacity requirement and addition by 30 GW to 80 GW by 2031-32.
Coal companies are likely to play an important role in the addition of such capacities, according to government officials.
The
coal ministry
has also been promoting large-scale diversification among its public sector enterprises, advising all subsidiaries to look for establishing new pithead thermal power plants.

SC clarifies computation of market value for claiming tax deductions,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sc-clarifies-computation-of-market-value-for-claiming-tax-deductions/articleshow/105818888.cms,07-12-2023,"Granting relief to
Jindal Steel
&
Power Ltd
(
JSPL
) and other companies on computation of
market value
for claiming
income tax deductions
, the Supreme Court held that the rate at which
state electricity boards
(SEBs) supply electricity to industrial consumers should be treated as market value for calculating such deductions under the
Income Tax Act
, a stand contested by the income tax.
The apex court said that the market value of any goods would mean the price that such goods would ordinarily fetch on sale in the
open market
.
The core issue raised in a batch of appeals was the recomputation of deduction under Section 80 IA of the 1961 Act by the assessing officer which was set aside by the
Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal and upheld by the High Courts, which ruled in favour of the assessees.
“Consequently, the price determined as per the
power purchase
agreement cannot be equated with the market value of power as understood in the common parlance. The price at which the surplus power supplied by the assessee (Jindal Power) to the SEB was determined entirely by the SEB in terms of the statutory regulations and the contract. Such a price cannot be equated with the market value as is understood for the purpose of Section 80IA(8),” a Bench comprising justices B. V. Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan ruled while upholding the Punjab and Haryana High Court’s decision that the price at which the state electricity department supplied electricity to industry consumers was the market value for determination of deduction under the Income Tax Act.
The Revenue authorities had contended that the recomputation of deduction made by the assessing officer was interfered with without appreciating the fact that the profits of eligible business of captive power generation plants of the assessees were inflated by adopting an excessive sale rate per unit for power supply to their own industrial units for captive consumption as opposed to the rate at which they supplied to the distributing companies i.e. the SEBs, which is the actual market rate.

In the JSPL’s case, it had supplied surplus power generated from its captive plants, which were set up to meet electricity requirements for its industrial units, to Madhya Pradesh SEB. The department alleged JSPL of inflating profits as it supplied surplus electricity to the SEB at the rate of Rs 2.32 per unit whereas its industrial units were charged at Rs 3.72 per unit. While the company claimed tax deduction of Rs 80.10 crore on profits of its generating units, the department denied the full claim on the grounds that Rs 3.72 per unit, the rate at which it supplied power to its own industrial units, was not the true market value. The department while holding that Rs 2.32 per unit was the real market value had restricted the JSPL’s claim at Rs 48.11crore.
Under Section 80-IA of the income tax law, certain businesses that operate in infrastructure, power, telecommunication, and other specified sectors are eligible for 100% tax deductions on profit for the first five years and thereafter for 25% for further five years and in the latter case, if the business is a company, then the deduction increases to 30%.

Bil Energy enters liquidation as it fails to get any revival plan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bil-energy-enters-liquidation-as-it-fails-to-get-any-revival-plan/articleshow/105792509.cms,07-12-2023,"The bankruptcy court has admitted
Bil Energy
System Ltd for liquidation as no viable revival plan was offered to the lenders of the BSE-listed firm that has failed to pay dues of about Rs 167 crore.
As part of the process, the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) has also appointed G Madhusudhan Rao as the company’s liquidator, said people aware of the development.
Last year in December, the Mumbai-based power sector equipment manufacturer was admitted under the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) in an application filed by the
State Bank of India
after it defaulting on its dues of about Rs 167 crore.
When the resolution professional of the company invited bidders, the company received interest from three potential applicants, including Aruna Kailash Shah, Mayank Goyal and Subhalakshmi Investment Advisory.
However, the lenders felt that without having clarity on and taking possession of the assets of the bankrupt company, the proposed bidders would not be able to submit an effective resolution plan and, accordingly, on June 3, 2023, the lenders with 100% voting rights decided to initiate the liquidation process of Bil Energy System.

The lenders noted that the company was not a going concern for three years before being admitted to CIRP, and that most of its assets are untraceable.
“The absence of physical assets, machinery transfers without lender consent before the CIRP, the status of going concern at the insolvency commencement date, and the need for clear demarcation and physical possession of factory land are some of the pressing issues detrimental to getting any value,” said Kalpit Khandelwal, partner at the law firm Aekom Legal. “Navigating this intricate landscape, the path to recovery for any lender is poised to be a journey marked by legal battles and intricate litigation rounds.”
Challenging this, one of the bidders, Mayank Goyal, argued that the decision of the CoC (committee of creditors) requires reconsideration, as it is against the tenets of the code and the objective of maximisation of value of the assets of the distressed company.
Countering this, the resolution professional (RP) of the company argued that State Bank of India (
SBI
) is the sole member of the CoC which enjoys charges on the assets of the company.
Besides, in August of 2015, long before the initiation of the resolution process, SBI had obtained an order from the district magistrate to take enforcement action, but could not take possession as entry was denied to the representatives of the lender.
The RP, also argued that the company’s machinery was sold by the suspended management long before the initiation of CIRP, without even seeking the permission of SBI, a charge-holder.
Bil Energy’s clients include
BHEL
, Emerson Climate Technologies,
Suzlon
, Bharat Bijlee and Tecumseh Products, among others.

Power plants may be set up at coal pitheads to cut costs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-plants-may-be-set-up-at-coal-pitheads-to-cut-costs/articleshow/105792325.cms,07-12-2023,"India will set up future
coal-based power plants
at the pithead as it looks to bring down
coal
transport costs in
power generation costs
, said a senior official.
A decision in this regard was taken after inter-ministerial consultations between the ministries of coal, power and railways which were anchored by the
NITI Aayog
, the official told ET. The coal ministry is in discussions with the power ministry and the Assam and Madhya Pradesh governments for two such plants near
Coal India mines
, according to the official. ""The average cost of coal production is around₹2,000 per tonne, after including all levies. But the landed cost of coal at power plants more than doubles to ₹4,300-4,600 per tonne due to transportation costs and loss.... The overall view in the government is that future coal-based plants should come up near pitheads,"" the official said.
Ample land is available with
Coal India
near its mines that can be utilised for setting up plants, he said, adding that feasibility of more projects is being assessed in collaboration with Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.
There is a growing view within the government that the country needs to expeditiously boost its power output to support economic growth, as it aspires to become a developed nation by 2030, and it has to rely on coal.

India's total coal production in 2022-23 was 893.19 million, up 14.77% year-on-year. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) monitors 181 coal-based thermal power plants, which have a combined generation capacity of 206 Gigawatt. Of these, 148, having 149 GW capacity, are non-pithead or located at a distance from domestic coal mines, which are their source of feedstock. These power plants were set up at a time when the country did not have a nationwide synchronised power grid, resulting in coal being moved over longer distances.

Coal will remain an important part of India's energy needs: Govt official,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/coal-will-remain-an-important-part-of-indias-energy-needs-govt-official/articleshow/105618730.cms,30-11-2023,"Coal
will remain
India
's main source of
energy
for years to come, a top government official said on Thursday, underscoring its commitment to the use of the fossil fuel as the U.N.'s
COP28
climate summit opens in Dubai.
""Coal is, and would, remain an important part of India's energy needs,"" Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's trip to Dubai.
Reuters reported that India, which depends on coal for 73% of its energy needs, is scrambling to add 17 gigawatts of coal-based
power
generation capacity at its fastest pace in recent years to meet a record increase in power demand.
India and China oppose any attempt to block construction of coal-fired power stations for their energy-hungry economies, while France, backed by the United States, plans to seek a halt to private financing for these plants at COP28, sources said.
Kwatra said India expects a clear roadmap on climate financing at COP28 and has always been upfront about its support for a ""loss-and-damage"" fund aimed at helping countries recover from environmental degradation caused by industrial development.

PPA
) with the company's generating units for a further five years. The order by MERC chairperson Sanjay Kumar, and members Surendra Biyani and Anand Limaye, virtually paves the way for continuation of generation from its units in suburban
Trombay
.
The company operates three units at Trombay of 500 MW, 250 MW and 180 MW, of which the largest one is coal-fired and is also the oldest. The power generated at the units is supplied to various parts of the financial capital.
""In view of prevailing transmission constraints, the Commission directs TPC-D to extend existing PPA with TPC-G by 5 years i.e. till March 2029,"" an order posted on the website reads.
It added that such an extension of PPA shall be signed unit wise.

"India scrambles to add coal-fired power capacity, avoid outages: sources",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-scrambles-to-add-coal-fired-power-capacity-avoid-outages-sources/articleshow/105595702.cms,29-11-2023,"India aims to add 17 gigawatts of coal-based power generation capacity in the next 16 months, its fastest pace in recent years, to avert outages due to a record rise in power demand, according to government officials and documents.
The expansion drive comes ahead of this week's
U.N. climate summit COP28
, where France and the United States are expected to clamp down on financing for coal plants, a move that India, dependent on coal for 73% of power generation, plans to oppose.
The world's fastest growing major economy has added an annual average of 5 gigawatts of coal-based electricity generation capacity over the last five years, but it is also ramping up renewable energy.
Yet it will fall short of satisfying power demand if it does not expand the number of its coal plants, said two government officials, who did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media.
In the next four months, India plans to add nearly 3 gigawatts of coal-fired generation, while the following
fiscal year
, starting from April 1, 2025, will see it add 14 gigawatts, or its highest level in eight years, according to internal government documents seen by Reuters.

The power ministry did not immediately respond to queries from Reuters.
To ensure completion of projects, New Delhi has begun a review of 38 coal generation plants whose construction has been held up for years, moving to resolve issues over equipment and land acquisition delays, the two officials said.
The government expects 28 of these projects to become operational in the next 18 months, it told power producers in a presentation at a meeting on Nov. 21.
Such projects include state-run power company
NTPC
's 660-megawatt unit in the eastern state of Bihar which has been delayed for 13 years, and two in the neighbouring state of Jharkhand held up for five years.
At the meeting, Power Minister R. K. Singh told public and private power generators that India would ""have to add coal-based thermal capacity,"" to meet requirements growing at an unprecedented rate, said the two officials, who also attended.
He also urged private companies to set up fresh coal-based power generation capacity to meet night-time demand and assured them of financial assistance.
Industry officials said such a call was being made for the first time in a decade since most private investments in the coal-fired power sector had stopped around the year 2012, partly because of India's green energy push.
While the coal expansion drive aims to meet an expected rise of 10% in demand during peak hours in fiscal year 2024-25, India will still meet a national commitment of half of fuel generation capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030, the two officials said.
Since adding 22 gigawatts of capacity in the fiscal year 2015/16, India cut back on plans to expanding coal-fired plants as the government opted for alternate energy capacity, officials have said.
Now India wants coal-fired plants sufficient to meet power demand of 384 gigawatts by the fiscal year 2031/32, revised up 5% from an earlier projection of 366 gigawatts, the government documents showed.
The government consequently revised up its estimate of coal-based power requirement by 9%, to 283 gigawatts.
""We have now modelled a stressed scenario factoring in a below-normal monsoon and a corresponding demand spike, such as we experienced in Aug-Oct this year,"" one of the government officials said.
That stress accounts for delays in the commissioning of 86 gigawatts of non-fossil capacity by fiscal 2031/32.
In the lead-up to Thursday's climate summit in Dubai, the
European Union
, U.S. and UAE have rallied support for a deal to triple global renewable energy installed by 2030.
More than 100 countries have backed this deal, officials told Reuters, but countries including China and India are not yet fully on board.

"Delhi's winter peak power demand may cross 5,700-MW mark, break records",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/delhis-winter-peak-power-demand-may-cross-5700-mw-mark-break-records/articleshow/105589450.cms,29-11-2023,"Delhi's winter peak
power demand
this year may break all previous records, crossing the 5,700-MW mark, officials of power distribution companies said on Wednesday. A
BSES
official said up to 60 per cent of the maximum winter power demand of over 3,600 MW in its areas will be met by green power. It will also bank on surplus power with other states to meet the increased demand, he said.
According to discom officials, the peak power demand of the city this winter can surpass previous peak winter demands. Last year, it had peaked at 5,526 MW, which was the winter record in the national capital, they said.
Last winter, the peak winter power demand in BSES's BRPL and BYPL areas reached 2,338 MW and 1,181 MW, respectively. This year, it may go beyond 2,400 MW and 1,200 MW for BRPL and BYPL respectively, a BSES official said.
""Ensuring reliable supply in any season is as much the function of proper power arrangements as also accurate demand forecast and robust distribution network. On all these aspects, BSES discoms are fully geared to ensure adequate power availability for its nearly 50 lakh consumers or around two crore residents during the winter months,"" he said.
Apart from long-term agreements with power plants, over 2,000 MW of green power will play a significant role in ensuring reliable power supply to BSES consumers during the winter months, the official said.

"13 hydroelectric projects to bring Rs 1.4 lakh crore investment in Arunachal, says Power Minister R K Singh",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/13-hydroelectric-projects-to-bring-rs-1-4-lakh-crore-investment-in-arunachal-says-power-minister-r-k-singh/articleshow/105565236.cms,28-11-2023,"The Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy R.K Singh that
Arunachal Pradesh
has entered into MoUs with central public sector undertakings for 13 projects, which will amount to a
hydroelectric capacity
of 13,000 MW adding that there will be investment of Rs 1.4 lakh Crore. Five hydel projects are under construction in Jammu & Kashmir.
Singh visited the 2000
MW Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project
located in
Arunachal
Pradesh/Assam on Monday.
The Minister inspected the
Subansiri
project construction sites, namely the dam, intake structures and diversion tunnels in Gerukamukh, Assam.
Expressing satisfaction with the review of the project, the Minister told the media that the importance of hydel projects has increased since round-the-clock renewable energy is not possible without hydro power.
“I went into all the details and I believe that by and large, the project is progressing as it should. The importance of hydro projects has increased since we need to make energy transition, reduce emissions and move to renewables. While we have solar and wind too among renewables, round-the-clock renewable energy is not possible without hydro. Our hydro capacity is increasing.”
Live Events
The Minister said that besides Subansiri which is a large project, the
Government of Arunachal Pradesh
has entered into MoUs with central public sector undertakings for 13 projects, which will amount to a hydroelectric capacity of 13,000 MW in Arunachal.
“These projects will bring in investment of around Rs. 1.4 lakh crore in the state, resulting in quadrupling of per capita income. And the nation will get clean power.”
Similarly, five hydel projects are under construction in Jammu & Kashmir; hence, our hydro potential in J&K too is moving ahead and a lot of investment is coming in, added Singh.
The Minister said, “Today, our hydro power capacity is 47,000 MW, which is 35% of our available hydro power potential. Developed countries however have utilized around 70% - 80% of their available hydro potential.”
Singh told the media how India’s power demand is growing and this requires addition of power capacity at a fast pace.
“Our power demand grew by 20% in August, September and October 2023, relative to the previous year. Our demand will keep growing at this rate, since according to NITI Aayog, our economy will keep growing at 7.5% for the next two decades. The peak demand in 2013 was around 1.35 lakh MW, while today it is around 2.31 lakh MW. Our power demand will double by 2030; our total consumption today is 1,600 billion units, which will become around 3,000 billion units. However, even now, our power consumption is low compared to developed countries; Europe’s per capita power consumption is around 3 times that of ours today. Our challenge hence is to add power capacity as fast as the growth in our power demand.”
The Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister explained that India is growing fast and adding power capacity to address the challenge of growing power demand.
“Earlier, we were a power deficit nation, but the government has added power capacity of 1.9 lakh MW in the last nine and a half years. Now, we have sufficient power and we are also exporting to neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal. Our under-construction capacity in renewables is around 70,000 MW, while in thermal, it is 27,000 MW. However, we are going to add another 53,000 MW to under-construction thermal capacity so that we are able to meet the power demand of 2030.”
By and large, whichever state asks us for power, we are providing and will continue to provide them, added the Minister.
Singh said that India has become a world leader in energy transition and that India has been pursuing a path of responsible growth.
“In COP21 in Paris, we had committed to make 40% of our capacity to be from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030; we achieved this target in 2021, nine years in advance. Hence, we are growing faster than developed countries. Developed countries have become developed by using fossil fuels. Hence, if we need to use fossil fuels for our growth, we will use it. Our per capita carbon emissions are one third of global average, while per capita greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries are three times that of global average. 80% of the carbon dioxide load in the atmosphere due to which there has been a rise in global temperature is due to the emissions by developed countries, while our contribution to the cumulative load is just 3% and our population is 17% of world population.”

“Brand engagement and brand building are a significant portion of the Rs 2000 crore that we plan to invest,” Bajaj noted.
Luminous has been a big believer in cricket to connect with its consumers, given its long-standing association with
Sachin Tendulkar
as its brand ambassador. It has also appointed Virat Kohli as a brand ambassador for its brand Amaze.
Rajasthan Royals CEO Jake Lush McCrum said Luminous got over a 40x return on their sponsorship investment in terms of media exposure during IPL 2023.
“Now that we've got another two years, we can do bigger projects and competitions to engage fans and consumers. Both companies will have a deeper connection, which will obviously drive greater business results and an improved brand impression for Luminous,” McCrum added.
Rajasthan Royals, McCrum said, decided to partner with Luminous despite getting a more lucrative offer from another brand in the past due to shared values like sustainability and aggressive marketing spends by the company to activate the sponsorship across India.
McCrum said the franchise also delivers value to its sponsors by creating digital content for fans and seamlessly integrating brands into those pieces of content.
The Rajasthan Royals CEO said around 70% of teams’ sponsors and partners will be existing ones with higher spending compared to last year, while 30% will be new brands. “We are on track to grow our overall sponsorship revenue by 30% for IPL 2024,” McCrum said.
The franchise is also betting on licensing and merchandising by working with like-minded partners to take the Rajasthan Royals brands to new arenas.

RK Singh
has called for investment and participation of the entire
power sector
in adding thermal capacities as India seeks to add 80 GW of such units by FY32. ""Thermal energy was written off a few years ago, which was premature. Thermal cannot be written off until energy storage becomes viable,"" Singh said.
Thermal power is going to stay until energy storage becomes cost-effective for round-the-clock supply through renewable energy, he added. ""The country absolutely needs at least 80,000 MW (80 GW) of capacity addition from today till 2031-32, which is essential to meet our base load requirements,"" Singh said while interacting with stakeholders in the power sector on Tuesday. Non-solar hours are going to be a serious challenge, considering growing power demand and weather events like in August this year, he said.
Electricity demand
has risen sharply this year with August registering a 16.3% growth on year, September 10.3% and October 21%.
Urging the industry to ramp up thermal capacity, Singh pointed out that the industry must be ready for indigenous development of technology and opportunities as assistance from the outside world may be limited.
Power demand has increased at an unprecedented rate due to rapid growth of the economy, Singh said adding that it cannot be achieved by
renewable energy sources
alone.

Since nuclear capacity cannot be added at a rapid pace, coal-based thermal capacity is needed for meeting our
energy needs
, he said.
""There is 27 GW of
thermal power capacity
under construction, and we had thought that we will add another 25 GW. But we have decided that we will start work on at least 55 GW - 60 GW of thermal capacity. As demand keeps accelerating, we will keep adding this capacity,"" he said.
Given the power needs, the industry will keep getting orders for thermal capacity addition for the next 5 - 7 years, he said.

Power units told to wrap up planned shutdowns by February,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-units-told-to-wrap-up-planned-shutdowns-by-february/articleshow/105424876.cms,23-11-2023,"New Delhi: In a bid to prepare for
demand
in the summer months, the
power ministry
has advised
thermal power plants
to complete their planned maintenance shutdown by February. This is to ensure that sufficient capacity is available before summer demand seeps in, which usually is from March to May.
The
Central Electricity Authority
notes the schedules of such shutdowns and prepares an annual list for it. However, this year the schedule has undergone changes, sources said. ""Due to change of plans [for maintenance] this year,
quantum
may be changed from the initial schedule for the coming months,"" a source said. ""A final compiled list could be out by the second week of December for the coming months.""
Earlier in 2023 as well, the power ministry had directed thermal power generators to avoid any maintenance shutdowns during March to May in anticipation of higher demand. However, led by favourable weather conditions, demand was lower year-on-year from March through June.
The average planned shutdown taken in July increased month-on-month to 12,787 MW from 5,784 MW in June and 1,517 MW in May, as per data from the
National Load Dispatch Centre
. Anticipating another rise in thermal power demand in September because of lower wind power generation, utilities were given a similar direction.
October onwards
planned shutdowns
have increased with the average planned outage for the month at 10,189 MW followed by 8,928 MW till November 21. Planned shutdowns of power plants can go anywhere from 15 days to 75 days, depending on the work required.

Singh said states must maintain availability of their thermal capacity and ensure any renovation, modernisation or life extension of
thermal plants
are done in time.
""If you do not maintain your thermal capacity and instead expect us to give power from central reserves, that is not going to happen. We will allocate additional power to those states which are maintaining and running their capacities,"" he said, adding that those who want to add capacities may do so.
""Power demand of the country has increased at an unprecedented rate due to rapid growth of the economy. India needs 24x7 availability of power, and we are not going to compromise on availability of power. This power cannot be achieved by
renewable energy
sources alone,"" he said.
According to him, since nuclear capacity cannot be added at a rapid pace, there is a need to add coal-based thermal capacity to meet energy needs.
""Given the power needs, the industry will keep getting orders for thermal capacity addition for the next 5-7 years. Thermal energy was written off a few years ago, which was premature. Thermal cannot be written off until energy storage becomes viable,"" he said.
The industry needs to ramp up thermal capacity, he added.
""Demand will continue to grow at a rapid pace. Prices in exchange are going to remain high. Those who add capacity will gain and those who don't will miss out on a golden opportunity,"" he stated.
Singh said the business environment in the power sector is excellent.
""We have put in place a payment security mechanism which does not have any parallel anywhere in the world. Payment is guaranteed within 75 days; current dues are 100 per cent up to date,"" he said, adding that even legacy dues are being paid.
Meanwhile, Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) vendors, such as GE & L&T, voiced their concerns regarding the bidding process.
They were assured that their concerns shall be looked into, as per the statement.
Other equipment suppliers raised issues like shortage of credit in the market, bank guarantees, qualifying requirements and technical specifications, it stated.
""The country absolutely needs at least 80,000 MW of capacity addition from today till 2031-32, to meet our base load requirements. Non-solar-hours are going to be a serious challenge, in light of the growing power demand and considering weather events like what we faced in August this year,"" Union Power Secretary Pankaj Agarwal said.

Court accepts plea to dissolve CG Power Solutions,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/court-accepts-plea-to-dissolve-cg-power-solutions/articleshow/105395671.cms,22-11-2023,"A
bankruptcy
court in Mumbai has allowed an application filed by the resolution professional of
CG Power Solutions
to dissolve the company after its lenders failed to revive the business due to a lack of material underlying assets.
The tribunal also allowed the lenders’ plea to pursue recovery against the erstwhile promoters under the bankruptcy laws even after the dissolution of the company.
Originally, the company had only two creditors including its holding company
CG Power
& Industrial
Solutions Ltd
and its financial creditor Stickwell (India) Pvt. Ltd.
In November 2020, Gautam Thapar-promoted CG Power & Industrial Solutions was acquired by Chennai-based
Murugappa Group

“There isn’t enough data right now to assess the outcome of avoidance transactions, including recoveries made thereunder,” said
Jyoti
A Singh, founder of law firm AJA Legal. “However, as per this order, such applications are maintainable even beyond liquidation, which is good news for the stakeholders. Financial creditors can take charge of such applications post-liquidation and pursue recoveries.”
Last year in December, the resolution professional of CG Power Solutions approached the tribunal seeking to dissolve the company since it neither is an operating company nor has any assets.
The RP had also moved a separate application to the tribunal to allow its lenders to pursue recovery dues under Section 66 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under Section 66, the RP or liquidator can approach the tribunal to recover losses that occurred on account of any fraudulent transaction and the directors can be made liable for the losses.
NPS Chawla, co-founder of law firm Aekom Legal, said the company may not have any tangible assets that can be liquidated. But intellectual property, even ""the brand name"" of the said Corporate Debtor"", may fetch some value. Further, it is worthwhile to explore whether there were any recovery proceedings halted due to the moratorium, as they can now be restarted to recover the balance dues from the ex-promoters if party to the pending proceedings.
In 2019, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) started a probe into the alleged irregularities at
CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd
and its 15 group companies including CG Power Solutions.
In November 2020, Murugappa Group firm
Tube Investments of India Ltd
(TII) acquired a controlling stake in
CG Power and Industrial Solutions
and at the time of the announcement, the group held 50.62% of the company's paid-up share capital. CG Power and Industrial Solutions also said in its exchange filing that it had received Rs 587.50 crore from the TII.

Domestic power demand to grow by 7 pc in FY24: Fitch,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/domestic-power-demand-to-grow-by-7-pc-in-fy24-fitch/articleshow/105291164.cms,17-11-2023,"The
domestic power demand
is expected to rise 7 per cent year-on-year in 2023-24, driven by robust
industrial activity
, according to
Fitch Ratings
. In a report, the ratings agency said it also expects the receivable days (payment cycle) to further shorten in the near term.
""Fitch Ratings expects India's power demand to increase by about 7 per cent in FY24, following a 7.1 per cent rise in 1HFY24, driven by robust industrial activity. This compares with a 9.5 per cent rise in FY23. The strong power demand should keep the average thermal
power plant load factor
(PLF) above 60 per cent,"" the report said.
It further said that regular payments under the central government's late payment surcharge (LPS) rules have lowered total dues from distribution companies (discoms) to power generation companies (gencos) to around Rs 70,000 crore, from Rs 1.3 lakh crore in June 2022, when LPS was launched.
Fitch expects the receivable days for Fitch-rated gencos to further shorten in the near term, although at a slower rate than the sharp improvement in FY23.
However, the long-term sustainability of gencos' better receivables position depends on structural changes to boost the operational and financial profiles of discoms. This includes timely and adequate tariff adjustments, state subsidies and greater operational efficiency.

On the coal stock situation, it said thermal coal inventory fell to around 8.4 days at end-September 2023, against around 18 days normative. This was despite government efforts to maintain adequate coal stock through increased local supply and encouraging higher coal imports in the past six months.
""We expect coal imports by power plants to remain moderate in 2HFY24, with boosted local supply amid expectations for robust power demand. Coal inventory at power plants dropped as power demand touched a monthly record high in August 2023. Coal stock continues to slide from strong power demand and a slight dip in local supply, standing at 8.2 days, against 20 days normative on November 13, 2023,"" Fitch Ratings said.

PTC India
would soon achieve a debt-free status following the
divestment
of its arm, PTC Energy, to
ONGC
for an enterprise value of Rs 2,021 crore, according to a top official.
PTC India
in October announced that the upstream firm ONGC had emerged as the successful bidder for acquiring its 100 per cent stake in
PTC Energy
for an enterprise value of Rs 2,021 crore.
In an interview with PTI, PTC India Chairman and Managing Director Rajib K Mishra said, ""With the transfer of PTC Energy's assets, the company would become virtually debt-free.""
Mishra said the enterprise value of PTC
Energy
includes Rs 925 crore bid of the ONGC as well as over Rs 1,100 crore debt component which will be transferred to the oil company after the transaction is complete.
PTC India's outstandings have reduced drastically due to the Late Payment Surcharge scheme and it is now emerging as a company that does not take loans to meet its working capital needs, he pointed out.
He further said that PTC India is also coming out of non-core business and is focussing on becoming an asset-light firm.
Live Events
The divestment of PTC Energy is part of the strategy to exit the non-core business, he said, adding that the company is more focussed on improving core margin per unit rather than on increasing trade volumes.
The data shows that per unit margin (including surcharge & rebate income) has increased from 6.07 paise per unit in the first half of the previous fiscal year to 7.38 paise per unit in the same period this year, reflecting an increase of 22 per cent.
Similarly, the per unit margin has increased from 3.39 paise per unit in the first half of the last fiscal to Rs 3.54 paise per unit in the same period this year.
The standalone core operating margin of the company has increased by 8 per cent in the first half of this fiscal to Rs 285 crore from Rs 234.85 crore in the same period a year ago.
PTC India Ltd, a government of India initiative, is the pioneer in starting a power market in India. The company has maintained its leadership position in power trading since its inception.
The trading activities involve long-term trading of power generated from large power projects including renewables as well as short-term trading arising as a result of supply and demand mismatches.

""The coal requirement for additional thermal capacity would be around 400 MT at 85 per cent PLF (plant load factor), and the actual requirement may be lower depending on the generation requirements in the coming times due to contributions from renewable sources,"" it said.
Coal stocks have started building up at thermal power plants and have reached around 20 MT. At various mines, the stock is at 41.59 MT.
The total stock which includes those under transit and at captive mines is 73.56 MT as compared to 65.56 MT last year, showing year-on-year increase of 12 per cent.

Improvements in trade receivables of power utilities expected: Fitch,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/improvements-in-trade-receivables-of-power-utilities-expected-fitch/articleshow/105104189.cms,10-11-2023,"Fitch Ratings
on Thursday said it expects improvement in trade receivables of power utilities, particularly from weaker state-owned distribution companies (
discoms
), and the pace of capital expenditure (
capex
) to be the key
credit drivers
for rated power utilities in the near to medium term.
Indian power utilities
have seen improvements in their receivables over the past two years, especially since the implementation of the late payment surcharge rules in June 2022. The average receivable days of seven Indian power utilities have fallen to 85 in FY23 from 142 days in FY21, as per the ratings agency.
The reduction in receivable days, especially for renewable energy generation companies, by about 100 days in FY23 has been driven largely by receipt of current payments and outstanding dues in monthly instalments, in line with the late payment surcharge rules. The risks of being barred from accessing power exchanges and of financial penalties have prompted discoms to make timely payments. However, the pace of capex for power utilities is expected to remain high, averaging around $7.9 billion a year in FY24 and FY25 compared with $6.2 billion in FY23 on renewable capacity additions, it said.

Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
The government has made a change in the SHAKTI policy enabling plants that don't have power purchase agreements and get fuel through the scheme to sell electricity in any segment on the electricity exchanges.
Through the policy change, such electricity can now also be sold in the term-ahead market (TAM) and the real-time market apart from DAM or through the
Discovery of Efficient Energy Price
(DEEP) portal. A methodology in this regard will be formulated by the power ministry in consultation with the coal ministry, as per the coal ministry's document. ""This is a positive development and will increase liquidity in all the product segments [on the exchanges]. Shakti scheme coal for all exchange segments will help in bringing down cost of procurement for the distribution companies,"" said Rohit Bajaj, Executive Director business development, regulatory affairs & strategy, at IEX.
Electricity volume through the SHAKTI scheme is substantial as many generators buy power through this scheme and sell it on the exchanges, Bajaj said. There are multiple avenues available on the power exchanges for any seller and all qualify as approved short-term bilateral transactions, so not restricting them to only one segment, such as DAM, is only imperative, said an industry expert.

He further emphasized the commitment of GoAP to ensuring the timely implementation of these projects.
Addressing the challenges posed by the rugged terrain and dense forest areas of Arunachal Pradesh, Deputy CM Mein deliberated on various components of the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), which will modernize the state's power systems and reduce the historically high Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses.
He also stated the successful commissioning of a vital high voltage transmission lines, the 132 KV Roing-Chapakhowa line and the upcoming 220 KV Kathalguri-Namsai line, will significantly improve the reliability of power supply in large parts of the State.
In this context, Union Minister of Power and NRE, R.K. Singh commended the state’s vast potential in the Energy sector and anticipated much greater revenue inflows to the State attributed to the power sector.
He further informed that earlier this year, GoAP initiated the Golden Jubilee Border Village Illumination Program to provide electricity to remote villages along the international borders. This unique project involves the operation of 50 micro-hydel projects with standalone distribution systems to ensure uninterrupted power supply to residents and defense establishments. Already, 17 projects in the first phase have been completed which were recently inaugurated by the Union Home Minister, Amit Shah when he visited Kibithoo, one of the vibrant villages in Arunachal Pradesh. These projects are now transforming the lives of citizens in these challenging border areas.
Deputy CM Mein also shared that the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, which had been dormant since 2019, has been reconstituted and is now operational. The Commission has already issued the tariff order for the current year.
For Rooftop Solar Power Program Phase II, GoAP has submitted a demand requirement of 1 MW to MNRE and is prepared to execute the works as soon as the allocation is received.
3. Recognizing the potential for Green Hydrogen in Arunachal Pradesh, GoAP intends to submit a proposal for a Domestic Electrolyser Manufacturing Plant in the state and seeks technical guidance and financial assistance. They also aim to explore the use of green hydrogen in industries such as fertilizer manufacturing and methanol production.
The Arunachal government requested for the deployment of an expert team to identify high solar potential areas and provide technical guidance for a state-wide survey to identify suitable locations, as solar energy projects have faced challenges due to climatic conditions and short daylight hours.
To identify the Sela Pass as a feasible location for wind energy projects and propose to conduct a detailed techno-commercial study to move this initiative forward.Green Open Access Rules to be finalised and to provide green open access to entities with a load above 100 KW.
The state government also requested
for the assistance of an appropriate PSU like NEEPCO to conduct a state-wide survey to identify potential sites for Pump Storage Plants (PSPs).Comprehensive Scheme for Strengthening of Transmission & Distribution System in Arunachal Pradesh is expected to be completed in December 2024 and anticipating a substantial reduction in T&D losses after the completion.
Deputy CM Mein also highlighted crucial requirements for the State and sought the support of the Power Ministry for a Comprehensive Plan for developing Small and Mini Hydroelectric projects with a capacity of 356 MW in remote areas, which should be considered a nationally significant strategic project with financial support.
Financial support for the installation of 30,000 solar street lights across all districts of the State, a project with a total cost of Rs. 90.00 crores.Support in expediting the approval of schemes for electrifying villages along international borders.

Union Power Minister R K Singh
on Monday said that conventional thermal power capacity will continue to play an important role till round-the-clock renewable power is available. Addressing a press conference on states' power and new &
renewable energy
ministers' meet, Singh said that there will be no compromise on providing round-the-clock power supply to people in the country.
He stated that there will be more renewable energy capacity addition than conventional power (thermal coal or lignite based).
However, he said that the role of thermal power will continue unless round-the-clock renewable energy is available (to the rising demand).
He drew attention towards rising
power demand
which grew by over 20 per cent in August, September and October as well.

He was of the view that amid rising demand, it is necessary to run power plants to their full capacity to achieve the goal of 24-hour electricity supply in a day.
He informed that average daily power supply in rural areas at present is for 22 and a half hours, while in cities it is 23 and a half hours.
He said that states have been asked to run power plants to their full capacity and also import coal for six per cent blending.
Acknowledging that state-owned
Coal India
is increasing production of the dry fuel, he said the demand of power is rising by over 20 per cent.
He said per-day shortage of coal at thermal power plants is around 2.5 lakh tonnes and suggested blending of imported coal is important.
Other issues discussed in the ministers' meet included green energy corridors, green hydrogen, new renewable purchase obligation related to distributed renewable energy, Singh said, adding that the issue of gencos overdues have almost disappeared.

India needs more capacity in future to meet rising power demand: Power Minister RK Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-needs-more-capacity-in-future-to-meet-rising-power-demand-power-minister-rk-singh/articleshow/105007281.cms,06-11-2023,"India
has a pressing need to add capacity to meet the growing demand of
electricity
and there will be no phasing or shutting down of coal-based power plants to ensure availability for economic growth, Power Minister
RK Singh
said on Monday.
“We have successfully met 241 GW peak capacity, but we are on the edge. If the demand keeps increasing, then we will not be able to meet [the rising peak demand]. And, it is increasing,” Singh said while addressing the state power ministers’ meeting in the capital.
Way Forward
The way ahead for this challenge is to add installations and for existing plants to run at full capacity, he said.
Some states have been drawing power from the central pool while not operating their own plants at optimum capacity, he added.
Live Events
If any state is not running all its plants, we will not be able to supplement them from the central pool, he said.
Additional capacities
Singh reiterated that the country would need 30 GW more of thermal power capacity to meet the growing demand in addition to the 51 GW already in the pipeline.
While most of this capacity is coming through state-owned companies, Singh said he was confident that private investment will also participate in the future.
Another challenge is that of meeting fuel demand, Singh said, adding that while coal production and carrying railway rakes have increased, it is not sufficient for the rising
power demand
.
Green target
Simultaneously, we will meet the targets that we set for ourselves in COP 26, Singh added. The country has a target to reach 500 GW non-fossil energy capacity, 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy and reduction of total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes till 2030.
“Our point of view is we are not going to compromise with the availability of power for our growth. We will not let any deficit come in the path of our growth and for that if we need coal, we will do that,” he said.

A spokesperson of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd said, ""In the last couple of months,
electricity
consumption has gone up substantially.""
In October 2023, the power consumption in Tata Power-Delhi Distribution Ltd area of operation went up by around 10.16 per cent to 845 MUs ( million units), compared to 767 MUs in October 2022.
""The demand has remained higher mainly due to delays in winter onset this year. The festive activities in the month of October have also contributed to the demand phenomena,"" the spokesperson explained.
However, the spokesperson stated that due to mild summer this year, the electricity consumption during April-May was substantially lower in comparison to the same period last year.
The spokesperson pointed out that the demand started inching up since July due to extreme humid conditions.
The power ministry had estimated the country's electricity demand to touch 229 GW during summer. The demand did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rain.
The peak supply, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July. Peak demand touched 238.19 GW in August. In September this year, it was nearly 241 GW.
Industry experts said power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June this year due to widespread rainfall.
They said power consumption grew in August and September, mainly due to humid weather conditions and also perk up in industrial activities ahead of the festive season.
They stated that the double-digit growth in power consumption in the month of October reflects the impact of festivities and better economic activities.
There were festivals of Navratri, Durga Puja and Dusshera in October.
The experts are of the view that power consumption growth will remain steady in coming months due to festivities and improvement in economic activities.

The demand for power products is expected to remain strong over the medium term amid aggressive global capex earmarked for renewables capacity addition, T&D (transmission and distribution) expansion, benefits from 'China+1' theme and favourable tariff structures in the US, it stated.
The power transmission infrastructure business encompasses the transmission assets in India and Brazil, which will now be transferred to Sterlite Grid 5 Ltd (SGL5).
Both SPTL and SGL5 will have independent boards and focused executive management teams.
Under the demerger scheme, existing Sterlite Power shareholders will receive one additional share of SGL5 for every share of SPTL they hold.
The company has filed the demerger scheme with the
National Company Law Tribunal
(
NCLT
) Mumbai for approval.
The approval process is expected to be concluded within the next 6 to 8 months, as it entails securing a range of approvals, including those from shareholders, creditors, and various regulatory authorities.
Sterlite Power has a portfolio of 32 projects, including completed, sold and under-construction ones, covering approximately 15,350 circuit kilometres of transmission lines across India and Brazil.

"Adani Power refuses to give up on Lanco unit, makes improved offer",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-refuses-to-give-up-on-lanco-unit-makes-improved-offer/articleshow/104896998.cms,02-11-2023,"Adani Power
has rekindled its desire to acquire bankrupt
Lanco Amarkantak Power
after backing out of the race last December. This week the company submitted a revised, improved offer of ₹3,650 crore to lenders versus the ₹2,950 crore proposal it made in December, said two people aware of the development.
The thermal power company's lenders will meet Thursday (November 2) to review the offer from Adani, the people said. Adani's new offer comes several months after a majority of lenders voted for a ₹3,020 crore resolution plan from a PFC-led consortium.
Lanco Amarkantak Power, which is undergoing corporate insolvency, operates coal-based thermal power projects along the Korba-Champa highway in Chhattisgarh.
Adani Power did not respond to ET's request for comments.
In January, the PFC-led consortium's proposal secured 95% of votes, while Adani Power got 17% votes. Reliance Industries, which was also in the race offering ₹2,103 crore, did not receive any votes, ET had reported on January 10.
Live Events
The
PFC
team was declared the winner since it won higher than 66% votes required to acquire a company under the
bankruptcy
process.
The PFC consortium that includes REC Ltd among others, emerged as the successful bidder partly because Adani and Reliance did not participate in the challenge auction for acquiring the power company, citing violation in the sale process, as reported by ET on December 1, 2022. They objected to the challenge auction which was introduced at a late stage and also raised concern over the conflicting role played by the PFC-REC team.
Since the PFC-REC plan is not yet approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
), lenders can file a petition with the tribunal seeking to withdraw the approved plan, legal experts said.
This, however, may not happen until PFC and REC, who jointly hold 41% debt in Lanco Amarkantak, agree.
Effectively, the PFC-REC team is a bidder as well as lender to the company. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) does not prevent debtholders from bidding for a company undergoing corporate insolvency. In this case, by virtue of being the largest debtholder, it can block any proposal. As per the IBC, anyone with over 34% debt can block a resolution. Conversely, a plan can be approved if 66% of lenders approve it.
In December 2022, when lenders voted for the PFC-REC offer, the company had ₹1,200 crore cash balance from operations. This has now risen to ₹1,800 crore. Thus, the increase in offer by Adani will compel lenders to reconsider their decision, said a consultant involved in this transaction.
The government-owned PFC consortium comprising PFC Projects, REC, SJVN Ltd and Damodar Valley Corporation has received approval from the Competition Commissioner of India for the deal.
Lanco has commissioned the first phase, comprising two units of 300 megawatts (MW) each that supply electricity to Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and the home state. Saurabh Kumar Tikmani, the resolution professional backed by KPMG, has admitted Rs 14,632 crore of claims from 17 lenders.

"Electricity supply by realty firms, mall owners, airport operators to attract 18% GST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/electricity-supply-by-realty-firms-mall-owners-airport-operators-to-attract-18-gst/articleshow/104884405.cms,01-11-2023,"Electricity
supplied by realty developers,
mall owners
, and
airport operators
to their tenants will attract 18% Goods and Services Tax (
GST
), the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has said. However, supply of electricity by Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) at rates charged by state electricity boards or
power
distribution companies (Discoms) will be exempted.
""It is clarified that whenever electricity is being supplied bundled with renting of immovable property and/or maintenance of premises, as the case may be, it forms a part of composite supply and shall be taxed accordingly,"" CBIC said in a clarification issued on Tuesday.
This came after real estate companies, mall owners, and airport operators asked whether GST is applicable on reimbursement of electricity charges received from their lessees.
""Even if electricity is billed separately, the supplies will constitute a composite supply and therefore, the rate of the principal supply i.e., GST rate on renting of immovable property and/or maintenance of premise, as the case may be, would be applicable,"" CBIC said.
Experts say this may lead to an increase in rental cost. The implications of the CBIC clarification also remains a point of concern in cases where real estate companies convert high tension lines to low tension lines, and charge higher rates due to transmission loss, or where RWAs impose higher charges and install their own billing meters.

Further, this clarification provides the tax department with a basis to address previous issues and potentially issue new notices to landlords who have not charged GST on electricity reimbursements, he added.

The official said, “Since we work in the hills, incidents like these can arise from building activity. During the years while the building was underway, we also made advantage of the diversion tunnels.”
Lakhimpur District Deputy Commissioner issued an advisory requesting the villagers residing in and around the bank of river Subansiri and adviced them to restrain themselves from activities like fishing, swimming, bathing, plying of boats etc. in the river water and not to venture in the river bed of Subansiri river during night hours under any circumstances to avert any kind of eventualities until return of normaley of the flowing water of the Subansiri river.
“The villagers may also be advised to keep their cattle's like Cow, Goat, Mithun, Pig, Dog etc. away from the river to avoid any accident/loss thereof.
Moreover, people living in the downstream and low lying areas of Subansiri river are advised to remain alert and not to panic relying on messages transmitted from un-reliable and un- official sources,” the advisory said.
However, the NHPC officer asserted that the operation of the hydroelectric power project will begin on time. The project is expected to start in March 2024.
The Subansiri Lower Hydro Electric Project, which commenced the construction work in January 2005 after obtaining forest clearance in October 2004, faced multiple bottlenecks since its inception causing huge delay in commissioning the mega power plant.

This project aligns with India's decarbonization goals, supporting the country's aim to achieve 500 GW of green energy by 2030.
AESL secured this project through the Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) route in December 2021, for a period of 35 years, on build, own, operate, and maintain basis.
Despite numerous challenges, AESL executed this project in a fast-track mode, taking into consideration the topological challenges while minimizing ecological impact, the company said.
The project also involved round-the-clock work in multiple shifts, allowing for enhanced progress.
AESL's execution prowess was displayed through the erection of two 48-MT towers in under 24 hours each, significantly surpassing the usual rate of 5-6 MT/day.
Furthermore, AESL successfully completed critical tasks such as the shutdown of the 400 kV D/C Pugalur-Pugalur (HVDC) line and the erection of tower structures under the constraints of the existing transmission line.
The construction phase encountered challenges related to foundations, which were overcome through the execution of stringing over coconut trees while adhering to all safety measures.
AESL, part of the Adani portfolio, is a multidimensional organization with presence in various facets of the energy domain, namely
power transmission
, distribution, smart metering, and cooling solutions.
It has presence across 14 states of India and a cumulative transmission network of 20,000 ckm and 53,000 MVA transformation capacity.

Imported coal-based power units told to operate at full capacity till Jun; fuel blending floor at 6%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-extends-mandate-on-imported-coal-based-power-plants-to-run-till-june-2024/articleshow/104691884.cms,25-10-2023,"The power ministry has directed imported coal-based plants to run at full capacity till June 2024 and all generation units to import a minimum 6% of their fuel requirement for blending. This is in the backdrop of continued rise in
electricity demand
, inadequate supply of domestic fuel and lower hydro generation.
The order for imported coal-based plants is an extension as current direction ends in October. However, for blending of
imported coal
at power generating units, the ministry has increased the requirement from 4% that was ordered in September.
In one of the two notifications issued on Wednesday, the ministry said there is a consistent rising trend in power demand, coupled with inadequate supply of domestic coal, which has resulted in rapid depletion of
coal
stocks at domestic coal-based plants across the country.
The gap between receipt of domestic coal and consumption of coal - domestic and equivalent domestic of imported coal - in September till October 9 was 12 million tonnes, the ministry said.
In the first half of the ongoing financial year, hydropower generation fell 11% on year due to variable monsoon rainfall and around 2,000 mw of hydro capacity is currently out because of recent floods in Sikkim, it added.

air conditioners
is estimated to expand nine-fold by 2050 and will exceed total
power consumption
in the whole of Africa today, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. In its latest
World Energy Outlook
,
IEA
said India will see the largest energy demand growth of any country or region in the world over the next three decades.
It projected India's energy supply to rise from 42 exajoules (EJ) in 2022 to 53.7 EJ in 2030 and 73 EJ in 2050 under stated policies scenarios and 47.6 EJ by 2030 and 60.3 EJ by 2050 as per announced pledges.
Oil demand is seen rising from 5.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022 to 6.8 million bpd in 2030 and 7.8 million bpd in 2050 under stated policies scenario. Under announced pledges, this demand is seeking 6.2 million bpd in 2030 and 4.7 million bpd in 2050.
IEA said over the past five decades, India witnessed over 700 heatwave events, which have claimed over 17,000 lives. Fuelled by its geographic and meteorological conditions, air conditioner ownership in India has been steadily rising with growing incomes, tripling since 2010 to reach 24 units per 100 households.
""The impact of cooling needs on electricity consumption is already clear,"" the Paris-based agency said.

""Electricity demand is sensitive to temperatures, and in India's case there is a sharp increase in demand as temperatures cross the 25-degree Celsius threshold..
Electricity consumption due to space cooling increased 21 per cent between 2019 and 2022, and today nearly 10 per cent of electricity demand comes from space cooling requirements.
""Household air conditioner ownership is estimated to expand ninefold by 2050 across the IEA scenarios, outpacing the growth in ownership of every other major household appliance including televisions, refrigerators and washing machines,"" it said.
""Residential electricity demand from cooling increases ninefold in the Stated Policies Scenario (
STEPS
) by 2050..
IEA said by 2050, ""India's total electricity demand from residential air conditioners in the STEPS exceeds total electricity consumption in the whole of Africa today..
In the Announced Pledges Scenario (
APS
), however, electricity demand for air conditioners is nearly 15 per cent lower in 2050 as it is in the STEPS as a result of increased use of energy-efficient air conditioners and thermal insulation in buildings. ""This reduction itself is larger than the total electricity generation by several countries today, such as that of the Netherlands"".
The growth in ownership and use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment is one of the key drivers of the increase in peak electricity demand in India.
In the STEPS, peak electricity demand rise around 60 per cent from the 2022 level by 2030 and cooling accounts for nearly half of this increase.
In the APS, however, the implementation of building codes, the use of more efficient appliances and the adoption of demand response measures enable the same cooling needs to be met with less energy. This reduces peak electricity demand growth by nearly one-quarter compared to the STEPS. Given that the electricity system is sized to meet peak demand, lower peak demand helps to lower electricity investment needs and system costs.
Although solar PV matches well with daytime cooling needs, cooling demand is also significant in India during the late evening and at night.
""Lowering cooling demand through energy efficiency policies therefore reduces the need for investment in batteries or expensive standby generation capacity, and thus helps to integrate renewables more cost effectively,"" IEA said.
IEA said India is moving into a dynamic new phase in its energy development marked by a long-term net zero emissions ambition, increased regulatory sophistication, a focus on clean energy deployment, and the creation of domestic clean energy technology supply chains.
Recognising the potential to transform its energy sector and reduce the import burden of fossil fuels while reducing CO2 emissions, India has announced a net zero emissions target by 2070, and has put in place policies to scale up clean energy supply and clean technology manufacturing.
""While clean energy investment in India more than doubles in the STEPS by 2030 from around USD 60 billion in 2022, investment needs to nearly triple by the end of this decade to be on a trajectory to meet its net zero emissions target, which is reflected in the APS,"" it said.
Although India's population growth has slowed to reach replacement levels, its urban population increases by 74 per cent and per capita income triples by 2050. Industrial output expands rapidly, for example through a tripling of output of iron and steel, and doubling of cement, plus there is a ninefold increase in residential air conditioner ownership by 2050.
""As a result, demand for oil and natural gas increases in the STEPS by nearly 70 per cent between 2022 and 2050, while coal demand increases by 10 per cent, even as solar PV makes inroads into electricity generation. As a result, India's annual CO2 emissions still rise nearly 30 per cent by 2050, which is one of the largest increases in the world,"" the outlook said.
In the APS, the increase in clean energy investment changes the outlook. In the STEPS, solar provides nearly 45 per cent of total generated power by 2050; in the APS, it crosses 50 per cent. In both the STEPS and APS, India achieves its target of 50 per cent non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030.
Clean energy investment in the APS over and above those in the STEPS also drives faster growth in electromobility, low-emissions hydrogen, grid expansions and other clean energy infrastructure.
""As a result, India's annual CO2 emissions fall sharply in the APS by over 40 per cent from current levels by 2050, even though its GDP quadruples over this period,"" it added.

Power ministry may refuse World Bank's coal transition fund plan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-ministry-may-refuse-world-banks-coal-transition-fund-plan/articleshow/104659369.cms,23-10-2023,"The
power ministry
may not participate in the accelerated coal transition
investment plan
submitted by the
World Bank
as it is not considering repurposing or retiring any coal-based
thermal power
plant before 2030, said people with knowledge of the matter.
The plan offers to facilitate a transition away from coal.
The ministry's stance comes as
energy demand
has been increasing in the country and capacity availability needs to be ensured, said the people.
Power minister RK Singh had said in September that India needs 25-30 GW more of thermal capacity than the 51 GW already planned in the country. Most of this capacity is expected to come from coal-based units.
""We will make available the electricity required for our growth and we are not going to default on that,"" Singh had said.

Thermal power plants have already been advised by the ministry to implement renovations and modernisation and life extension of their units for running up to 2030 and beyond or operating in two-shift mode to facilitate solar and wind energy integration into the grid.
Since August, power demand has increased sharply, led by irrigation, cooling appliances, lower hydro power generation and higher economic growth, according to government officials.
Overall power consumption between September 1 and October 22 increased about 14% year-on-year to 240.4 billion units.
Grid India, the demand and supply management cell of the power ministry, expects demand to ""remain elevated"" throughout this financial year.
As per a Goldman Sachs report, India will need 23 GW more coal capacity than was planned by the government as stationary storage capacity could fall short of demand by 2031-32.
The World Bank's accelerated
coal transition
programme is aimed at a just transition from coal power to clean energy in emerging economies.

Plans afoot to ensure coal stock at pithead power units,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/plans-afoot-to-ensure-coal-stock-at-pithead-power-units/articleshow/104659234.cms,23-10-2023,"The
coal ministry
plans to ensure 40 million tonnes of closing stock at
pithead thermal power plants
and more than 75 million tonnes at mines as on March 31.
This comes after stocks at domestic coal-based plants depleted at a faster pace in the first half of the month.
Coal stock
at domestic power plants was down to 18.4 million tonnes as of October 15. The stock has depleted by 3.3 million tonnes in the first half of the month. Last year on October 15, the stock at domestic coal-based plants was 22.6 million tonnes.
During the last one week, the trend of coal stocks at the thermal power plant end has been reversed, the ministry said on Monday. Now the daily supply of coal is more than the average daily consumption and there is a trend of coal stock accretion, it added.
After a long rain spell during early October in coal-producing states, output has picked up and total production from all sources during the last 10 days is over 26.57 lakh tonnes per day, the ministry said.

As on October 21, total coal stock was at 71.35 million tonnes, including coal at mine pit-head, in transit and at power plants, as against 60.44 million tonnes in the corresponding period last year.
The production and transportation are usually lower in the first half of the financial year since the period is predominantly summer followed by monsoon, it said.
The ministry has also worked out a strategy for ensuring normal production of coal during the festival season by offering higher wages to contractual workers.
Till October 21, coal production saw a growth of 12.7% on year, the ministry said.

Lenders held a challenge mechanism auction for price discovery on receving plans from three applicants.
PwC-backed resolution professional Radhakrishnan Dharmarajan invited bidders to participate in the auction at a base price of ₹2,809.12 crore.
There were 18 rounds of bidding, which started on Friday noon and lasted till 3.00 am and resumed the following day and lasted till Saturday evening. In the nineteenth round, the Adani-Dickey team offered ₹3,440 crore while Jindal Power did not give a counter bid. Sherisha Technologies, the third applicant, did not participate in the bidding process.
Adani Power and Jindal Power did not respond to ET's request for comment.
Coastal Energen is among the rare power companies for sale which has two operational units of 600mw each in Tamil Nadu, and a power purchase agreement with Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp (Tangedco) until September 2028 for one of its units.
In recent months, Adani failed to acquire Lanco Amarkantak, while Jindal Power was not considered as a preferred bidder for SKS Power. This may have prompted both Adani and Jindal Power to bid aggressively for Coastal Energen, the people cited above said.
The RP has admitted claims of ₹12,247 crore from employees, trade creditors and lenders. The Adani-Dickey's offer of ₹3,440 crore will equate to a recovery of 35%.
Ahmed Bahuri-promoted Coastal Energen's power is designed to operate on imported coal, a strategic fit for Adani, which operates coal mines overseas, people cited above said.
In the past, Adani Group has acquired Essar Power, Karaikal Port and Korba West Power under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The RP had asked all Adani and Jindal Power to submit a detailed plan, which will be put for a vote before lenders.

On Thursday ET had reported that SEML has challenged the NCLT order earlier this month directing the CoC to reconsider their decision of declaring the company as the preferred bidder to take over the debt-laden SKS Power Generation Ltd.
The plea, filed in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday, has said that the court has erred in questioning the wisdom of the CoC and has sought a direction to the NCLT to consider the plans in its current form.
Nagpur-based SEML was declared the winning bidder, pipping Torrent, Vantage and Jindal in a close fight with less than one percentage point difference between the top four bidders. SKS owes Rs 1,890 crore to Bank of Baroda and State Bank of India (SBI). The plant is in high demand because it's a rare working power plant available for sale with 25 years of fuel agreement accompanying a railway line.

is able to grow at around 9- 10%"" he said while addressing the foundation day of the
Central Electricity Authority
(
CEA
).
The CEA is the planning cell of the
power ministry
.
Singh said the authority should look at the needs for reforms in the power sector.
The role of CEA is to look ahead and identify what are the systems and technologies which need to be put in place in the power sector, Singh said.

There is a need to increase the pace of addition of transmission and generation capacity, he said.
He emphasized on carrying out studies, identifying tradeoffs among policies, being abreast of the latest developments in technology and advising the government based on that.
Singh said that it is the job of the CEA officers to analyze and advice on matters like the mix of solar energy and wind energy targets.
""Scientific progress cannot be made on hunch, but on sound analysis. You need to communicate by your performance, that you are deservingly the primary advisors to the government in the power sector,"" he said.
The minister also stressed on the need to figure out how much power will be needed in 2050.
""Would we have enough land to meet the solar power we would need? Let us find that out and work out alternatives as may be needed,"" he said.
The focus of the body should also be on the need to prepare for catastrophic events like the one in Sikkim, he added.

SKS Power lenders to review Torrent's resolution proposal next week,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sks-power-lenders-to-review-torrents-resolution-proposal-next-week/articleshow/104449164.cms,16-10-2023,"Lenders of
SKS Power
will meet next week to review the
resolution plan
offered by
Torrent Power
following a directive by the
bankruptcy court
, which observed that the decision by the lenders to sell the power company to
Sarda Energy and Minerals
was based on incomplete financial data, said people with knowledge of the matter. Lenders of bankrupt SKS Power unanimously voted on May 16 in favour of a plan given the stock exchange listed Sarda Energy. Torrent Power,
Jindal Power Ltd
and Vantage Point Asset Management were also in the fray for the same power producer.
The division bench comprising Prabhat Kumar and Kishore Vemulapalli, in their order stated, ""This Bench takes note of legal proposition that the Adjudicating Authority cannot interfere with the commercial wisdom of Committee of Creditors (CoC), however, this bench feels that the decision taken by CoC is on the basis of incomplete financial data placed before it.""
The court held that such a decision-making process by the legal advisor, process advisor and resolution professional makes such a decision-making process 'perverse and amenable to interference by this bench.'
In its appeal, Torrent has stated that it had offered RS 2,000 crore as upfront cash payment while Sarda offer was Rs 2,005 crore, which included Rs 400 crore as deferred payment. Torrent added that it offered to pay upfront following a communication from the resolution professional that the CoC expects the commercial offer made under the resolution plans to be paid by way of upfront cash payment.
“Lenders are unlikely to invite new plans. They will review the existing plans in the backdrop of the observation made by the tribunal,” said a person involved in the resolution. “So far,
Sarda Energy
has not communicated to lenders whether it would appeal against the order at the appellate tribunal,” he added.

“Lenders may seek some clarification from bidders, and based on it, scores would be assigned to all resolution applicants,” one lender said. “Thereafter, the RP will again invite lenders to vote based on revised scores,” he added.
Lenders had appointed BDO as their process advisor, assigning scores to all the resolution applicants. The division bench also observed that two of the unsuccessful resolution applicants had offered 10 per cent equity free of cost as part of the resolution, but BDO has not assigned any financial value to it. The court order showed that Jindal Power had the highest score, followed by Sarda per the redistributed plan.
Bank of Baroda has the highest voting share of 92 per cent, while State Bank of India has 8%. The total verified financial creditors claim stood at Rs 2122 crore.

"PFC, REC seek DIPAM nod for debt resolution plan for KSK Mahanadi",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/pfc-rec-seek-dipam-nod-for-debt-resolution-plan-for-ksk-mahanadi/articleshow/104381187.cms,13-10-2023,"Power Finance Corporation Ltd and
REC
Ltd have sought approval from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management or
DIPAM
for a
debt resolution plan
for
KSK Mahanadi Power project
, which is currently under the insolvency process.
The state-owned lenders, with
NTPC
Ltd as the technical partner, had earlier given expression of interest for the 1,800 MW coal-based power project in the Champa district of Chhattisgarh along with companies like
Vedanta Ltd
,
Adani Power Ltd
, and
Jindal Power Ltd
.
While the PFC-REC duo had submitted its bid for the project, it was later clarified that they needed DIPAM's approval to participate in the resolution process, three people in the know said.
The two non-banking financial companies had given a similar proposal for the stressed Lanco Amarkantak Power project, initially without the approval from the department. Later the department accepted it as 'fait accompli', two of the people said. The two companies are also a part of the consortium of lenders of the project.
After more clarity on the matter through the experience of the Lanco project, it was stated that even a lenders' resolution in cases where they are creditors to the distressed asset, will require the department's approval. Emailed query to Dipam's secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey remained unanswered till the time of publishing.
PFC
and REC did not respond to queries sent by ET.

coal
will leave miners with the equivalent of 100 job cuts daily through 2035, mostly in China and India.
Mine closures will eliminate about 15% of global coal mining jobs by that year, about 400,000 in total, according to a new report published by Global Energy Monitor this week. The figure is likely to rise to nearly 1 million by 2050 as the world turns to cheaper wind and solar
power
generation.
Bloomberg
The
job losses
highlight some of the social challenges that companies and governments face as they transition the world away from fossil fuels in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Mining jobs lost to automation, efficiency and commodity cycles have become thorny political issues from the US to Europe to Australia.
One way to ease the pain of layoffs is to give ex-miners priority for job opportunities triggered by mine shutdowns, such as work needed to rehabilitate land and mitigate environmental impacts after operations cease, according to the report.

China produces and uses more than half the world’s coal, and is home to more than 1.5 million mining jobs, according to Global Energy Monitor. Its Shanxi province alone is likely to shed more than 240,000 mining jobs through 2050. China’s government has been pushing firms to gradually replace underground workers with automated machines in part to ease the social cost of future mine closures.
Coal India Ltd.
, the state-owned miner that produces more coal than any other company, is likely to face the biggest corporate impact from layoffs, with potential cuts of nearly 74,000 workers by 2050, according to the report.
The firm has already seen its headcount dwindle from 310,000 in 2017 to 240,000 this year, according to company filings. Its staff count is falling by about 13,000 to 14,000 people a year, a pace that’s expected to accelerate due to retirements and outsourcing work that will limit new hiring, company officials have said.

"India, Russia conduct major technical test of nuclear fuel & safety of Kudankulam power plant",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-russia-conduct-major-technical-test-of-nuclear-fuel-safety-of-kudankulam-power-plant/articleshow/104305243.cms,10-10-2023,"In a major technical development In-Core Instrumentation System (ICIS) and System for Integrated Analysis (SIA) for Kudankulam
Nuclear Power Plant
NPP Unit 3 were tested by Rusatom Automated Control Systems JSC (RASU JSC, a company of Rosatom State Corporation) together with representatives of
Nuclear Power
Corporation of India LTD (NPCIL).
Acceptance tests and comprehensive integration tests were carried out at the site of the manufacturer, Specialized Scientific Research Institute for Instrumentation Engineering (SNIIP JSC, a company under the management of RASU JSC). ICIS and SIA were the first subsystems to receive a confirmation of readiness. Equipment within these systems ensures acquisition, analysis and transmission of information on the reactor state to Main Control Room (MCR).
Following the tests, the equipment will be shipped to
Kudankulam
NPP site in Tamil Nadu state, India, before the end of 2023.
“All these subsystems are part of MCDS – reactor monitoring, control and diagnostic system. They ensure monitoring and control of the reactor plant in different operating modes, and have a project-specific design that takes into account technical features of the future power unit and the customer’s requirements. In this case, the equipment has been designed for Kudankulam NPP Units 3 and 4 with VVER-1000 reactors”, said Dmitry Kukushkin, Head of Kudankulam NPP I&C Project Office, RASU JSC.
Similar equipment developed together with
NRC
Kurchatov Institute was installed at Kudankulam NPP Units 1 and 2 almost 20 years ago, and it has been operating without any issues.
Live Events
In-Core Instrumentation System (ICIS) is an important part of Instrumentation and Control System, and the main element ensuring the monitoring of nuclear fuel and reactor safety parameters. The system monitors power density fields, temperature fields, and keeps track of process parameters in different operating modes of the reactor, including abnormal situations.
ICIS is an autonomous, functionally completed system with redundant main software and hardware. Due to this fact, the system keeps performing its functions in case of a single failure during the entire period of time necessary for rectification of such failure, that is, operates continuously.
Humidity Leak Monitoring System (HLMS) and Acoustic Leak Monitoring System (ALMS) for primary circuit and secondary circuit serve for detection of leakages from coolant pipelines and main steam pipes. IAEA standards require that NPP power units must apply at least three independent methods to detect potential leaks and, therefore, at least three independent automated systems that implement those methods. So, safe operation is ensured by means of several methods: by acoustic noise (ALMS-2), by the rate of steam distribution (HLMS-2), and by air humidity in containment premises and the most probable locations where a leakage may occur (HLMS-2P).

Federal Bank to stop funding for thermal power projects by 2030: Official,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/federal-bank-to-stop-funding-for-thermal-power-projects-by-2030-official/articleshow/104291602.cms,09-10-2023,"Mumbai:
Federal Bank
, the largest and the oldest private sector lender in Kerala, will completely stop funding for
thermal power projects
by 2030, according to a senior bank official. As a first step towards its de-carbonisation initiative, the Kochi-headquartered bank will halve its exposure to the thermal power sector by 2025.
The bank's green power sector exposure is Rs 5,083 crore across seven to eight projects, mostly solar and wind areas.
""We have internally set a target of completely stopping funding thermal power projects/traditional energy sector by 2030. As a first step towards achieving our
decarbonisation
efforts, we will be halving our exposure to this polluting sector by 2025,""
Ashutosh Khajuria
, the chief mentor at the bank, told PTI here.
Currently, the bank's green loan book is Rs 5,083 crore and the sanctioned book of Rs 7,490 crore. ""We see our green book crossing Rs 13,000 crore by 2025,"" Khajuria, who retired recently as an executive director of the bank, said.
On the overall growth, he is confident of the bank continuing to clock 20 per cent credit disbursal growth this fiscal driven by home, business and gold loans.
Live Events
The bank's home loan and LAP (Loan Against Property) books are worth Rs 35,000 crore. Out of the total, around Rs 15,000 crore is LAP and the gold loan book is Rs 22,000 crore, which is more than 10 per cent of its Rs 1.96 lakh crore assets.
According to Khajuria, the fall in remittances in the first quarter was nothing but reflection of the exchange rate fluctuations and expressed confidence in continuing to maintain the more than 20 per cent market share in the segment.
Last year, the country netted USD 107 billion in remittances and 21 per cent of the total amount was through the bank's channels, Khajuria said.
The market share remains same despite the marginal fall in the inflows due to the exchange rate volatility of recent months and that the year will close with over USD 100 billion inflows.
Khajuria also said a funding of Rs 980 crore from the IFC will be reaching the bank's coffers anytime as all the approvals, including that of the RBI are in place now.
The
World Bank
arm IFC was awaiting RBI nod to invest Rs 980 crore in the bank for some time now.
In July, the bank had concluded a successfully Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) issue for Rs 3,000 crore, Khajuria said.

electricity consumption
grew nearly eight per cent to about 847 billion units (BU) in the first half of this fiscal year from April to September, showing uptick in economic activities in the country. According to the official data, electricity consumption rose to about 847 BU during April-September 2023 from 786 BU in the same period of the previous fiscal.
The industry experts opined that the widespread unseasonal rain in April, May and June has affected the power consumption as it could have grown in double digits in the country.
They stated that there was strong recovery of power demand as well as consumption in August onwards due to unusually high humidity level which increased the use of cooling appliances like fans, coolers and air conditioners.
They also said power consumption grew in August and September, mainly due to humid weather conditions and also perked up industrial activities ahead of the festive season.
The data also shows that peak power demand touched a record high of 241 GW during April-September 2023 compared to 215.88 GW in the first half of fiscal 2022-23.

The
power ministry
had estimated the country's electricity demand to touch 229 GW during summer. The demand did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rain.
The peak power demand, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July. The peak power demand touched 238.19 GW in August and reached a record high of about 240 GW in September this year.
Anticipating high peak power demand of 229 GW in the country during the summer season in 2023, the ministry had taken many steps to avoid outages.
The ministry had invoked Section 11 of the Electricity Act 2023 to mandate all plants powered by imported coal to run at full capacity to ensure adequate supply of power in the country.
Besides, the ministry also mandated domestic coal based power plants to import the coal for blending to avoid any shortage of dry fuel.
The experts said that these measures may have increased import of coal in the country but it was necessary to ensure round -the-clock power supply in the country.
As per the latest report of
Central Electricity Authority
(CEA) for August, 2023, India has installed power generation capacity of 424 GW, which includes 206 GW coal based, 47 GW of large hydro, and about 132 GW renewables (solar, wind energy etc).

Vantage Point has argued that its offer for a higher amount than that offered by Sarda was not considered by the resolution professional. While Torrent argued that the revised financial proposal of Sarda ought not to have been considered, as no revision could have been done or permitted.
The plant is in high demand because it's a rare working power plant available for sale. SKS also has 25 years of fuel agreement with South Eastern Coalfields, a
Coal India
unit, with a railway line directly transporting coal to the plant, which is a rare facility.
The company has two power plants each with the capacity to generate 300 MW of power. The company had been ailing because the second power plant was not operational. During the insolvency process, the lenders infused interim finance in the company to operationalise the second power plant. The company became profitable after the second plant was started.

However, it stated that one casualty was reported from the Teesta V power station.
Ongoing works of under construction hydro project
Teesta VI
(500 MW) of NHPC have been disrupted, it said.
The flood water had entered the powerhouse and transformer cavern. Bridges connecting the right and left banks at the barrage as well as the
Power House
have been washed out.
Two crane operators working at the project site are reported missing. All efforts are being made to trace them, the statement said.
No major damages have been observed in TLDP-III (160 MW) (Teesta Low Dam - III Hydropower Plant) and TLDP-IV (132 MW) power stations located in the downstream West Bengal state, it added.
Both the power stations are safe but kept in shut down condition due to heavy siltation brought along with the flood water, it noted.
NHPC is constantly trying to start the electricity generation in both the projects in coming days. Also, no damage is reported in Rangit Valley, where NHPC's Rangit IV power project (120 MW) is under construction and
Rangit Power Station

The quantum of damage at all the project sites will be assessed in detail after the water level recedes, the ministry said.
NHPC is making all possible efforts with the help of the state government, disaster management authorities and district administration to maintain the supply of essential commodities like food, medicine, electricity etc. in the affected regions.

CFM ARC has claimed Rs 4,954 crore, an amount that is disputed by Reliance Power. In the exchange notice, Reliance Power said that it neither accepted nor confirmed the amount claimed by the ARC.
However, the assets of Vidarbha Industries Power shall be sufficient to meet the debt, Reliance Power said.
Vidarbha Industries Power had petitioned the Bombay High Court objecting to the lenders' decision to sell the company’s debt under a Swiss challenge auction.
Senior counsels Harish Salve and Prateek Seksaria appeared for Vidarbha Industries, while senior counsels Janak Dwarkadas and Venkatesh Dhond
had
appeared for
Axis Bank
and the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI).
Vidarbha was aggrieved that the lenders accepted a binding offer of Rs 1,220 crore from CFM ARC even though the existing management of Reliance Power had offered a Rs 1,260-crore settlement. Lenders proceeded with the sale since the court did not grant a stay. CFM ARC also agreed to improve the offer to Rs 1,265 crore to encourage lenders to conclude the deal.
The company has a principal debt of Rs 2,569 crore and $26.7 million (Rs 220 crore) as on July 6, according to a document circulated by lenders inviting bids for their debt.
Last year, the apex court dismissed Axis Bank's petition to admit Vidarbha Industries for insolvency, stating that the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
), which approved admitting the company, should have considered external factors that had led to the delay in payments by the borrower.
At the heart of the matter was a claim made by Vidarbha Industries that has won an award of Rs 1,730 crore from the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity. This amount exceeded the Rs 553 crore claimed by Axis Bank.
Vidarbha Industries has installed two coal-based units of 300mw each at the Butibori industrial area in Nagpur, Maharashtra. Both are non-operational due to the unavailability of coal.
It had a power purchase agreement with Anil Ambani-promoted
Reliance Infrastructure
. In 2017, it sold the Mumbai distribution business to Adani Transmission.

energy storage
is essential to enable the
renewables growth
Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
has promised, but so far incentives have been lackluster, according to the head of California-based Energy Vault Holdings Inc.
The promising renewables market in India could be stifled by the high cost of power storage, which will become an essential component of the transition away from fossil fuels, Robert Piconi, chief executive officer of the company, said in a interview.
Renewable electricity available at any time of the day and night “is sort of a holy grail,” Piconi said. “It’s not achievable with the current technologies, because they are not economical.” He added that the lack of public finance is going to slow the pace of the transition.
Piconi is traveling in India to talk with potential partners, including coal giant
NTPC Ltd.
and clean energy company ReNew Energy Global Plc. He said details of the partnership with NTPC will be disclosed later this year.
India’s potential for large-scale deployment means renewable power can be built on the cheap, and storage will be essential to support this expansion, Piconi said. But given the country’s price-conscious market, adding enough battery capacity to displace coal and meet evening demand peaks with clean energy is a tall order, he said.

India will soon accept bids for the construction of a 100 megawatt round-the-clock clean energy system, backed by storage, but until the technology’s price drops, new coal plants will continue to be planned in order to meet the needs of a growing economy, Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh said earlier this month.
Bloomberg
The government has a plan to offer a total of $2.5 billion in subsidies to large scale battery makers, Singh said last year, although a firm proposal has yet to come. The government has rolled out $2.3 billion of production-linked-incentives for electric vehicle batteries, benefiting companies such as Reliance Industries Ltd., Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. and Rajesh Exports Ltd.
Richer economies are deploying more aggressive subsidies to kick-start the energy storage market. In 2017, the European Union launched the European Battery Alliance, which so far has attracted about €100 billion ($105 billion) in investment commitments. This year, the US issued a $9.2 billion conditional loan to Ford Motor Co. to build three battery factories.
A scenario for India in which the growth of energy storage is non-negotiable, but comes at a stiff price, “is going to force a lot of innovation to try to deal with the cost issue,” Piconi said. Since research and development are inherently expensive, “subsidies would definitely help,” he added. “In some cases it keeps some companies going that otherwise wouldn’t make it.”
Energy Vault is marketing its proprietary gravitation technology, where heavy blocks are lifted with the help of electric motors and become storehouses of potential energy, which can then be converted into electrical power when they’re lowered to the ground.

Norwegian Geotechnical Institute
(
NGI
) to explore feasibility of harnessing geothermal potentials that the state’s numerous hot springs offer.
The intention of this MoU is to provide a facilitating mechanism for the two parties to work together on mutually agreed, progressive and supportive activities; aiming for further development in the field of Geotechnics and Rock Engineering by dealing with complex sub-surface geological and geotechnical issues faced by the state.
To begin with, NGI will carry out geological, geochemical and geothermal investigation of few selected geothermal sites in Tawang and West Kameng districts that will include MT Survey to decipher the deeper geoelectrical configuration of geothermal springs (hot-springs) and feasibility to utilize the Geothermal Energy resources for further use.
The MoU was signed by Repo Ronya, Secretary, Science and Technology, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, and Dr Rajinder Bhasin, Technical Expert, NGI, Norway, in presence of Chief Minister Pema Khandu, Science and Technology Minister Honchun Ngandam, Chief Secretary Dharmendra and Dr Vivek Kumar, Senior Advisor, Norwegian Embassy, New Delhi.
Congratulating NGI and the department of science and technology, Chief Minister Pema Khandu said that it’s a right step towards green and clean energy production especially in the light of global warming concerns.

“It’s a great coincidence that this MoU is being signed on World Tourism Day as its theme this year is ‘Tourism & Green Investment’ that perfectly goes in tandem with this new initiative,” Khandu pointed.
He expressed optimism that the study will lead to development of renewable geothermal sources in Arunachal Pradesh and increase energy supply to meet present and future demands.
“Many of the hot springs are located in mountain areas where generators run on fossil fuel for electricity and heating. These can be replaced by geothermal energy with no CO2 emissions,” he said.
Admitting that this is completely a new technology for the state, Khandu expressed hope that NGI, with its expertise in the field and experience in successfully implementing one project in Ladakh, will give a new direction to energy production that will be beneficial not only to the local populace residing in the high mountains but also to the army personnel posted there.
Khandu also expressed hope that Arunachal’s relation with NGI will go beyond harnessing geothermal resources, especially in the fields of road construction and tunneling.
“Arunachal Pradesh is geographically and geologically completely different from rest of the country. Therefore, a tailor-made technology is needed for construction of roads and tunnels here. As Norway, with similar geological features, has one of the world’s best road infrastructure and world class tunnels, we can benefit from its technology,” he expressed.
Dr Rajinder Bhasin, Technical Expert, NGI, agreed with the Chief Minister and informed that Norway, despite being a small country, has about 7000 kms of tunnels that shorten road distances eventually enhancing government revenue.
Dr Bhasin, who visited a few places in West Kameng, said the state has tremendous potential for development of infrastructure to make it one of the best tourism state in the country.
“I have worked for about a decade in Bhutan and I thought Bhutan was the ultimate. But visiting Arunachal Pradesh for the first time, I realized that I was wrong all the time. This is heaven,” he said.
Representing the Norwegian Embassy, Senior Advisor Dr Vivek Kumar said that the Embassy is ready to facilitate cooperation between Norwegian agencies and experts with the state government in sectors that matter.
The current project is also being technically supported by the Royal Norwegian Embassy through NGI.
The Centre for Earth Sciences & Himalayan Studies (an autonomous organization of Department of Science & Technology), Government of Arunachal Pradesh, has been interacting with NGI for technical assistance to perform feasibility studies for harnessing geothermal resources in the State.

"India's energy challenge is two-fold — one is transition, the other is incremental demand: Prashant Jain, JSW Energy",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-energy-challenge-is-two-fold-one-is-transition-the-other-is-incremental-demand-prashant-jain-jsw-energy/articleshow/103955801.cms,26-09-2023,"In an interview to ET Now,
Prashant Jain
, Joint MD & CEO,
JSW Energy
, shares his business outlook and talks about India's energy challenge. Edited excerpts:
ET Now: How is JSW Energy gearing up for capacity expansion?
Prashant Jain:
In the last two decades, the power demand elasticity to the GDP has been 1:1. But a lot has changed in the last two decades. There is complete electrification that has happened in the entire country. The second is, the transmission and distribution losses are behind us. The energy efficiency drive is behind us. All that has eaten out some of the power demand elasticity.
So, probably we am going to see 1.2 to 1.25 times of power demand to GDP elasticity. If GDP is going to grow around 6.5-7% over the next one decade, then power demand can be there around 8-8.5%. But even if you are being very conservative, you will be seeing 6.5-7% power demand as compared to what you saw 5% in the last two decades.
The other side is supply. Last year you said supply was not catching up with demand. How long do you see this mismatch continuing?
It is a big question. Last month we saw the peak power deficit at close to 10.5-11%. The same deficit we saw in 2004-2005. But remember, in 2004-2005 our grid was around 75GW, while today it is 200GW. So the same percentage of the power deficit at 200GW would now account for 20GW. It is a meaningful thing.
India is facing two challenges. One is energy transition, and the second is incremental demand. India is the third largest power market in the world, but it is the fastest growing. Now if you are talking about even 7-8% demand growth, you are talking about 17-18GW. If you want to meet that by fossil fuel or a balance of thermal plus
renewables
, we are looking at a huge capital investment, which has not happened in this particular sector.

So it is a big challenge now. On top of it, you are talking about energy transition. Now large corporates want to move away from fossil fuel to
renewable energy
. Also, India has set a net-zero target. There are the large refinery and industrial complexes that want to set up more and more incremental capacity. All that put together is creating a big challenge in front of us.
Enough has not been done in last one decade in terms of capacity addition. There used to be over-capacity at one point of time. But that has gotten absorbed. Now it is an immediate challenge. That will get mitigated, but it is going to be a little cold winter for next three years.
You say 40-50 gigawatt of thermal capacity might be coming up, would you be participating in it? Or is your focus completely on renewables now?
We will be participating because it is like water — wherever there is better profits we would like to be there. However, not in substantial capacity.
Whatever we are going to put in, it is not going to be 100% of thermal. But yes, 10-15% of incremental capacity will be certainly coming in thermal space, because we see a good opportunity.
Recently we did one acquisition where we have got a foothold on a pithead plant in Odisha. Where the mine is located, coal prices are going to be the lowest. And this is a 700 megawatt plant, so it could be an anchor at this location itself. We can add 3-4 thousand megawatt of thermal capacity without any hesitation. A lot of land and water and infrastructure is available to us and low coal price.
Another piece I see is a thermal power plant which we are having in Rajasthan based on lignite. There is enough lignite available to double that capacity in times to come.
Are you looking at getting into a lot of backward integration as well? With solar, we have seen that you are doing the wafer in the manufacturing cell etc. Even for battery, are you looking at doing backward integration...
Not really. But yes, JSW Group has ambition in terms of EV. If that fructifies, there could be a synergy for to look at battery manufacturing. It will primarily be on the basis of automobile requirement. We would like to evaluate it at that time. But right now for supply chain for BESS project, we are not primarily looking at battery manufacturing.
Could green hydrogen be a big part of transition from thermal to renewable? Do you think it could be a bigger macro trend?
Much larger, because you know it is a combination. It is, I would say, an exponential of that because to produce green hydrogen you need green energy first. So it is a combination of everything.
Very large capital expenditure is going to be deployed, because to produce green hydrogen you need solar, wind and storage. After producing green hydrogen, you put another piece of CO2 capture it. So it is a large ecosystem that will be created. I think India is going to see huge work on that front.
You have got big targets that the board has given you — make profits 3x, make operational capacity almost 3x. How you going to achieve that. What is the 2030 roadmap like?
We decided based on the strategy 1.0. We were doing pretty good on terms of the execution. We got satisfied with the development of our capability. Our team worked really hard. We realized that the size of opportunity was also improving, because not enough execution was being done on the ground by most of the other players.
We realized that we were generating more cash and we could capture a little more. So we upgraded our targets in terms of execution capability. We realized that other than the generation side there is also a huge opportunity coming in our way in pump storage. We have been working on this is piece for last 24-30 months.
We took the plunge and decided that in addition to adding another 10 gigawatt of generating capacity, we will be doing 40 gigawatt hour of storage also. This will be coming both from BESS as well as PSP. And now the team is working round the clock on that. We see that some bits have already come.

Power companies plug into smart meters for sustainable solutions,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-companies-plug-into-smart-meters-for-sustainable-solutions/articleshow/103941608.cms,26-09-2023,"A device that informs you of how much electricity your appliances are using every month. A device that notifies you on what time of day to use your power-guzzling appliances; puts an end to inaccurate
energy bills
and, better still, allows auto switch-off of devices when not in use.
This is the smart meter, and power transmission and distribution companies (discoms) such as
Adani Energy Solutions
,
Tata Power
,
Torrent Power
among others are in the race to deliver such meters to their customers.
Over the past few months, nearly a dozen companies have announced plans and won orders to implement the smart metering project across locations. Why? Consumption data from these
smart meters
will help power distributors make distribution more sustainable, curb losses, arrest power thefts and leakages, and balance the grid, directly addressing the climate emergency.
""With smart metering you see a lot of advantages. We also tell the customers that they can save money by flattening their (consumption) curve and providing them with solutions,"" Anil Sardana, managing director, Adani Energy Solutions had told ET in August. Sardana added that his company has an order book of ₹5,800 crore so far for providing smart meters.
Such meters are also seen as the key to transform the electricity grid into a smart grid. Power discoms are banking on smart meters, along with the use of artificial intelligence (AI), to improve their operational efficiency.

""We are making India's power distribution network future-ready by accelerating digitalisation and automation, including implementing hybrid meter technology. This, in turn, is enhancing grid intelligence and making it resilient and sustainable,"" said Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director, Tata Power, in the company's annual report for FY23.
Tata Power has 12 million consumers in its distribution business and has so far installed over 510,000 smart meters in Mumbai, Delhi and Odisha.
According to a Morgan Stanley July report,
Power Grid
estimates the smart meter investment opportunity at ₹1.5 lakh crore and Adani Energy Solutions Ltd estimates the investment opportunity at ₹2.2 lakh crore. A key reason for this push to smart meters is also due to the launch of the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) in 2021.
The scheme aims to reduce AT&C - or Aggregate Technical & Commercial - losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% and the ACS-ARR gap to zero by 2024-2025. ACS is the average cost of supply per power unit, and ARR is the average revenue realised.
As of June 2023, the government has sanctioned 230 million meters (6.5 million installed). While the power ministry (National Smart Grid Mission) is tracking the scheme, it is being implemented by EESL (Energy Efficiency Services Ltd), PFC (Power Finance Corp), REC (Rural Electric Corp) and discoms.
Also aiding the adoption of smart meter installation is the Time of the Day (ToD) tariff that will be notified from April 1, 2024, for industrial and commercial consumers, and from April 1, 2025, for the rest.
According to industry players, ToD will reduce total energy bill by using more renewable power and cut down generation of greenhouse gases by coal-fired power plants helping not only companies but also the country to meet its net zero emission goals.
When the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing, thermal, hydro power as well as gas-based capacity is used - which costs higher than renewable power. A ToD tariff will help the customer make an informed choice in terms of power use.
""Smart meters are a new-age tool that will bring a paradigm shift in India's power distribution segment,"" said an industry official, adding that meters are currently priced at ₹5,000 a unit but the prices may drop going forward.

Tuticorin Coal Terminal: Jindal Power moves NCLAT to be considered,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/tuticorin-coal-terminal-jindal-power-moves-nclat-to-be-considered/articleshow/103845570.cms,21-09-2023,"New Delhi: Power generation company
Jindal Power Ltd
Thursday filed an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal seeking to be considered as an applicant for the acquisition of insolvent
Tuticorin Coal Terminal
Pvt Ltd.
Challenging an order of the National Company Law Tribunal's Mumbai bench, which had held the company ineligible for participation in the resolution process,
Jindal Power
argued that another company,
Seapol
, was allowed to file a resolution plan despite its name not appearing in the final list of prospective resolution applicant prepared by the committee of creditors. Jindal Power requested that the same rights be extended to the company that were given to Seapol, as the final list was prepared three years ago.
The
NCLAT
asked the resolution professional of Tuticorin Coal Terminal to file an affidavit putting the facts of the case on record and listed the matter for October 5. It observed that allowing Jindal Power to submit a resolution plan would mean fresh submissions from other entities interested in taking over the operations of the insolvent company.

The government has already laid down a strategy to add 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for five years starting this financial year.
India will also launch a pilot project using
green hydrogen
as storage for round the clock power having a capacity of 100 MW, Singh said.
The current cost, as per preliminary calculations, of such a storage based power is ₹6 per unit, which is cheaper compared with last two months' average price of ₹8/unit on the power exchanges, Singh said.
""If this is successful then it will establish a benchmark,"" he said.
India will be the largest producer of green hydrogen and ammonia in the world and the largest exporter because it has the cheapest renewable power, he said adding that the country has already amassed substantial
manufacturing capacity
for it, positioning itself as a global leader in this sector.
He said that the recent memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia on energy will bring investment in India in the sector and also encourage investment by Indian companies in the Middle East nation.

However, Singh said that if the round the clock (RTC) renewable energy works out as per our calculations (viable) then I don't have to go for
thermal power
capacity addition.
He talked about green hydrogen storage as the RTC renewables for future growth.
Singh has said India will soon launch a pilot project for producing 100 MW of round the clock power using green hydrogen as storage.
India will be the largest producer of green hydrogen and ammonia in the world and the largest exporter because it has the cheapest renewable power, he said, adding that the country has already amassed substantial manufacturing capacity for green hydrogen, positioning itself as a global leader in this burgeoning sector.
If you have green hydrogen as a storage which costs around Rs six per unit then it is cheaper than gas and battery energy storage, he explained.
He talked about coming out with a pilot bid for green hydrogen storage capacity of around 100 MW for testing grounds and to make this RTC renewable energy available commercially.
""We have come out with pilot bid for 100 MW for establishing green hydrogen storage. If the the green hydrogen storage cost comes to Rs six per unit (in the bid) then we are in business,"" he said.
The average price of electricity in past couple of month has been Rs eight per unit, he said and added that if we are making this (green hydrogen storage) RTC renewable energy at Rs six per unit then future is going to be for renewables.
Singh's plans about adding more thermal capacity to meet rising demand in the absence of viable RTC renewable energy at present assumes significance in view of India's ambitious target of having 500 GW of renewables by 2030 and its energy transition programme.
He said: ""I am going to be the largest producer of green hydrogen.""
He also informed about government's initiative about providing the carbon credit facility for green hydrogen as industry will benefit from this.
He said that about 88GW of renewable energy capacity is under works.
According to the latest report of Central Electricity Authority, India has 178 GW of renewable energy capacity, which includes 47GW of large hydro, 71GW solar and 44GW of wind energy.

Creditors to IL&FS Tamil Nadu Power reject NARCL's offer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/creditors-to-ilfs-tamil-nadu-power-reject-narcls-offer/articleshow/103644159.cms,14-09-2023,"Mumbai:
The Committee of Creditors
for IL&FS
Tamil Nadu Power Company
(ITPCL), a consortium of 17 banks led by Punjab National Bank, have turned down a proposal from the National Asset Reconstruction Co (
NARCL
) to acquire the debt of ₹9,000 crore and is moving ahead with a debt restructuring plan.
During a meeting held last week, the lenders' committee rejected the government-backed
bad bank
's offer, a source said.
Lenders felt that NARCL's offer of ₹4,700 crore in a 15:85 structure was below their recovery expectations through the debt restructuring process. Under 15:85, 15% of the amount is paid upfront while the remaining is paid by way of security receipts.
""Lenders have rejected NARCL's offer as the company has cash of around ₹3,000 crore which will improve their recovery in case of restructuring,"" a source said.
There is a dispute regarding the distribution of cash accumulated within the company over the past five years. While some lenders want cash to be distributed prior to receiving approvals for the restructuring, the company insisted on obtaining all restructuring approvals first, leading to a deadlock, as reported by ET.

.""
Sarma recently said that state’s peak hour electricity demand has increased from 18OO MW to 2500.
There is load shedding the state. Sarma said, “ There is load shedding for some time. Earlier, electricity demand during the peak hours was 1800 MW. State on its own generate 165 MW while the rest are purchased. It is astounding that electricity demand has gone up that high.”
He added, “ State government has entered into arrangements . We purchase power from open sources. The rate of electricity is Rs 10 per MW. We have to purchase 700 MW of electricity from open source to meet the demand in peak hours and supply electricity constantly to the people. We have to pay Rs 6 crore daily. We will need Rs 720 crore additionally for the purchase of electricity for four months.”
He said, “ We will discuss if we can restrict the peak hour load to 2000 MW by load shedding. We are exploring different things. We will see if tariffs can be increased. There are two factors for the increase of electricity demand in the state. Firstly, 50 MW of power is used for railway electrification works. Secondly, due to the rapid industrialization of the state, power demands go up.”
He said, “But in the next year, Neyveli Uttar Pradesh Power Ltd (NUPPL) will supply 260 MW from the
NUPPL
’s 3×660 MW Ghatampur Thermal Power Plant. If Subansiri Lower Hydro Electricity Project commissions, we will receive 500 MW from them. It will improve our
power situation

Such an arrangement comes with a minimum offtake guarantee by NVVN, an NTPC subsidiary.
In case the power is not sold in the markets, the offtake can be lined up through the tertiary reserve
ancillary services mechanism
.
Ancillary services, here, mean those which immediately come into service with a sudden change in frequency.
The move comes on the backdrop of
rising electricity demand
from mid-August when peak demand reached record highs and coal stocks at power plants started depleting at a much faster pace.
Coal stocks at power plants fell over 6 million tonnes since August beginning to 28.4 million tonnes as on September 4. The stocks are likely to deplete further, and September may end with 23 mt of coal stocks, a government official said.
The power ministry in a recent order asked power plants to import 4% of their coal requirement till March as against till September. It also asked imported coal-based power plants to further run at optimal capacity till October.
The ministry had made a similar move in April in anticipation of higher demand in summer to avoid pressure on domestic coal and its transport. Gas-based power is generally more expensive and is sought only when demand is high.
Peak electricity demand hit a high of 240 GW on September 1, and has mostly been over 200 GW on the back of irrigation needs with deficient rainfall in monsoon and sultry weather.

""We have to set up a huge ecosystem for renewable energy. Our pace of capacity addition in
renewable energy
is one of the fastest in the world. Our cost of making renewable energy and our cost of producing green hydrogen will be one of the lowest in the world,"" he said.
Singh said that India will emerge as a huge exporter and the world will come to follow our approach on green hydrogen.
Speaking about the environment, he said that India's contribution to the global carbon dioxide load is just four per cent while our population is 17 per cent.
He gave an overview of ongoing green hydrogen pilots and steps being taken by India in this direction.
""Many green hydrogen pilots are going on in India and across the world. We have pilots for green steel and in heavy duty transportation. Electric mobility is not viable for long distance heavy mobility; hence hydrogen or ammonia is the answer.""
The shipping industry is expected to go green within around 10 years.
""So, we have to emerge as a refuelling destination for all green ships, since we can provide them with green hydrogen or green ammonia or whatever fuel they want at the lowest cost.
""We have to prepare bunkers at shipyards and also have pilots for green shipping on our own. We are in talks with the Ministry of Shipping, to take this forward,"" he said.
He said that India will come out with a pilot for green hydrogen or green ammonia for storage for round-the-clock renewable energy.
Singh opined that most of the methods of running the pilots are already commercially viable. There are already companies which have developed turbines which can use hydrogen or ammonia for making electricity.
""If we have to make it successful, we have to make it commercially viable. Commercial structuring is key to making it a success,"" the minister said.
He said that the world is changing. ""We are leading this change, we are leading the world,"" he said.
New & Renewable Energy Secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said that the real stars of the
National Green Hydrogen Mission
are the pilot projects, which have been allocated Rs 1,466 crore and these hold the key to innovation and experimentation.
He informed that an amount of Rs 456 crore is set aside for steel, Rs 495 crore for transport, Rs 115 crore for shipping and Rs 400 crore for other projects.

Smart metering is the link that brings consumer satisfaction but there is little awareness for that, Rawal told ET.
The implementation of the smart metering project has to be taken forward strongly as it will transform the complexity in the distribution sector, he added.
“Once you have digitalisation on the grassroots it will be consumer satisfaction positive as well as discom health positive,” he said.
Energy planning
Rawal believes that smart metering will help distribution companies with data to plan their energy requirements better.
While the smart metering program is aimed for bringing down inefficiencies in the distribution sector, the implementation of the program faces certain challenges.
The inertia in power distribution companies with the perception of losing control with the involvement of a third party and the central government is one such challenge, Rawal said.
Another headwind is delay in the tendering process because of lesser experience of distribution companies in public-private-partnership tenders.
Finding skilled manpower on a large scale for handling smart metering cloud applications is also challenging, he added. As smart meter tenders roll out, the need for such skilled workforce would grow.
Road ahead
“Intellismart is conscious of all this and has positioned itself in a manner that we can handle this,” he added.
Smart metering is not just about efficient billing. It has relevant data for discoms, thereby leading to better planning of electricity demand and management, Rawal said.
Banking on its strengths, the company plans to foray into gas smart metering as well as water metering in the coming years.

India steps up coal use to stop outages triggered by unusually dry weather,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-steps-up-coal-use-to-stop-outages-triggered-by-unusually-dry-weather/articleshow/103336105.cms,04-09-2023,"India
has stepped up the use of coal to generate electricity in a bid to stop outages caused by lower
hydroelectricity
output, and as an increase in renewables is struggling to keep pace with record power demand.
It is unusual for India's electricity use to spike in August, when temperatures are lower due to the annual monsoon that runs between June and September. Demand typically peaks in May, when Indians crank up air-conditioners to beat the heat, and industries operate without rain-related disruptions.
However, the driest August in more than a century has resulted in power generation surging to a record 162.7 billion kilowatt hours (units), a Reuters analysis of data from the federal grid operator Grid India showed.
Coal's share in power output rose to 66.7% in August - the highest for the month in six years, according to a Reuters analysis of government data. Lower rainfall lead to the share of hydro power in overall output plunging to 14.8%, compared with 18.1% in the same period last year.
The government has repeatedly defended the use of coal citing lower per capita emissions compared with richer nations, and rising renewable energy output.

India asks utilities to import 4% coal until March 2024
LOW IMPORTS
Despite higher demand for coal, power plants have slashed imports by 24% to 17.85 million metric tons during the first four months of the fiscal year ending in March 2024, government data showed, due to a 10.7% increase in production by state-run
Coal India
.
Lower imports by the world's second largest importer of the polluting fuel behind China have kept global thermal coal prices depressed in recent months.
Analysts and industry officials attribute the higher power use to farmers using more electricity to irrigate fields due to insufficient rain, intermittency of renewables, and increased cooling demand with warmer-than-usual temperatures.
""Given the already stressed supply situation, as poor monsoon in August resulted in high agricultural demand, the sudden fall of wind generation ... has further aggravated the situation,"" power analytics firm EMA Solutions said in a LinkedIn post on Thursday.

India's peak demand - the maximum capacity required during any time of the day - rose to a record 243.9 gigawatts (GW) on Aug. 31, the Grid India data showed, exceeding available capacity by 7.3 GW.
Electricity supply fell short of demand by 780 million units in August, the data showed, marking the highest shortage since April 2022, when India faced its worst power cuts in six and a half years.
Weather officials expect country-wide rainfall in September to be in line with the long-term average, possibly providing some respite to utility operators.
RENEWABLE CHALLENGE
Coal's share in output rose to 74.2% in the eight months that ended in August, the Grid India data showed, compared with 72.9% in the same period last year and on track for a third consecutive annual increase. The share of hydro fell from 10.9% to 9.2%.

Overall power generation has risen by more than 108 billion units this year, dwarfing an increase of about 16 billion units in renewable generation.
India failed to achieve a target to install 175 GW in renewable energy by 2022, and has since stated that it would try to boost non-fossil capacity - solar and wind energy, nuclear and hydro power, and bio-power - to 500 GW by 2030.
Achieving that target would require over 43 GW more of non-fossil capacity every year, nearly three-times the average non-fossil capacity addition over the last two years to July.

""It is a non-solar hour (nighttime) shortage. Days when wind generation falls and demand is high become stressed. The gap has to be filled by thermal,"" a senior government official said.
India's
power ministry
on Friday issued directions to all power plants to import 4% of their overall coal requirement for blending with domestic coal uptil March next year to maintain stocks amid higher consumption.
""Grid India has projected continuation of elevated power demand levels throughout the current fiscal year,"" the letter issued to all coal-plants on Friday said. As a result ""... the need has arisen to continue use of imported coal for blending purpose.""
The power ministry had in January asked utilities to import 6% of their coal needs until September. The mandate is now extended until March next year at 4%.
India's power and
renewable energy
minister
R K Singh
will chair the meeting on Monday, another letter showed. The meeting aims to discuss reviving the 25 GW of gas-based capacity either idled or underutilised due to lack of fuel.
Requests for comment from the federal power ministry on Saturday were not immediately answered.
India's electricity consumption grew 16% in August according to available data from the grid operator. The country has been able to meet its daytime demand with
solar power
.
However, a limited addition to coal-based capacity in the past decade and a lack of energy storage technologies coupled with current low generation by wind and hydro power plants has led to a challenge in meeting nighttime supply needs.

SKS Power's losing bidders challenge lenders' decision,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sks-powers-losing-bidders-challenge-lenders-decision/articleshow/102955818.cms,23-08-2023,"Sarda Energy
& Minerals' acquisition of the bankrupt
SKS Power
Generation Ltd has hit a bump with both
Torrent Power
and
Vantage Point
Asset Management appealing against the bankers' decision in separate petitions. The losing bidders have alleged bias in the evaluation process and have sought the court's direction to consider their plans afresh by providing another opportunity to offer better value.
Vantage Point has submitted that its offer for a higher amount than offered by Sarda was not considered by the resolution professional. Torrent has argued that the revised financial proposal of Sarda ought not to have been considered, as no revision could have been done or permitted. The company has said that it was not afforded equal opportunity to do so.
Torrent and Vantage did not reply to separate emails seeking comment.
Both the petitions challenging the decision of the committee of creditors (CoC) came even as the
NCLT
had reserved its order on Sarda's takeover of SKS last month. After hearing these challenges, the two judge bench of Prabhat Kumar and Kishore Vemulapalli directed the resolution professional Ashish Rathi to submit the relevant pages of CoC minutes detailing the decision making process, the e-mail sent to resolution applicants to submit their plans and their reply to this communication. All parties have also been asked to be served copies of the documents which are not barred under confidentiality.
Nagpur-based Sarda Energy & Minerals was declared the winning bidder, pipping Torrent, Vantage and Delhi-based Jindal Power in a close fight. ""Banks have recovered all their dues in a rare instance with operational creditors getting Rs 200 crore. Sarda's offer was higher by about Rs 50 crore than the rest and though Vantage was close, it lost out on the evaluation matrix because it did not have any power sector experience,"" said a person familiar with the process.

The bidding was close with less than one percentage point difference between the top four bidders. ""Though Vantage's offer was close, Sarda had promised to give all the proceeds from pending litigations amounting to Rs 500 crore which also worked in its favour,"" this person said.
ET Bureau
SKS owes Rs 1,890 crore to
Bank of Baroda
and
State Bank of India
(
SBI
). The plant is in high demand because its a rare working power plant available for sale. SKS also has 25 years of fuel agreement with South Eastern Coalfields, a
Coal India
unit, with a railway line directly transporting coal to the plant, which is a rare facility.
Bankers are however confident that the NCLT will vindicate their choice. ""This is a late challenge, almost two months after the decision was made. In fact both parties have also taken back the Rs 10 crore earnest money deposit (EMD) in July. The decision was taken after a thorough process. The courts have always supported the judgement of the CoC and even this time it will be the case,"" said a second person aware of the process.
Lead lender BoB and resolution professional Rathi did not reply to emails seeking comment.
A third person familiar with the process said the EMD was given back to both Torrent and Vantage as part of the process. ""Both bidders waited for the case to come up in NCLT before filing their challenges as the plan is still not approved by the court,"" this person said.
For lenders the latest challenges could delay a process that is among the fastest to progress since it began in August last year. A reshuffle in the court benches last week could also delay matters.
In a notification last week, Prabhat Kumar, the member technical in this case, has been transferred to another bench and replaced by Anu Jagmohan Singh.
To be sure, both challengers can still appeal in the NCLAT in case the NCLT order does not go their way.

"Coal stocks sufficient to meet rising demand, says Union Minister Pralhad Joshi",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/coal-stocks-sufficient-to-meet-rising-demand-says-union-minister-pralhad-joshi/articleshow/102955318.cms,22-08-2023,"There is sufficient
coal
stock with thermal power plants and
Coal India Ltd
, coal minister
Pralhad Joshi
said on Tuesday. Almost 80 million tonnes of coal are available at plants and with the state-owned miner, he wrote on microblogging site X.
The minister's comments come in the wake of rising
electricity demand
because of the humid weather and higher irrigation due to dry spells in some regions. In a meeting held for ensuring
coal production
and supply to power plants, Joshi also emphasised on boosting transporting of the fuel via the rail-sea-rail route.
Electricity demand met in India hit a fresh record in August, touching 234 GW on August 17.
Experts attributed the unanticipated rise in demand to the dry spell in some parts of the country and humid weather.
Coal stocks at power plants have depleted at a tad faster than previous months, but are still sufficient. The stocks fell to 32 million tonnes from 34.9 million tonnes in the first 20 days of August. This is because March-May this year saw less electricity demand on an average with lower-than-usual temperature that resulted in less-than-expected depletion of coal stocks at plants. Closing stocks at plants so far in monsoon, when coal production typically slows, have been adequate. The power and coal ministries have been working to ensure the depletion is covered with adequate supplies, a government official said.

The maximum demand met on August 17 was 234 GW, the highest ever on record. Demand was higher than 229 GW predicted by the planning cell of the
power ministry
for the summer.
May turned out to be less hot than anticipated due to unseasonal rain and recorded maximum demand met at 221.7 GW, as per the Grid Controller of India.
In June, the maximum demand met reached 223 GW.
Apart from August 17, highs were recorded on other days this month. August 10 saw maximum demand met at 224.8 GW and August 11 at 228.9 GW.
Live Events
The unanticipated rise in demand this month was attributed to the dry spell in some parts of the country and humid weather. There is an underlying increase in demand because of economic activity but the dry spell in some areas has added to it in August, an industry expert said.
Cooling appliances and irrigation have been the major demand contributors, experts said.
""Rainfall has been late in some parts of northwest and peninsular India but heavy in east central and northeast,"" a government official said.
Coal
stocks
Prices in the day-ahead market on
power exchange IEX
rose in tandem with the increase in demand. August 18 recorded a closing price of ₹9.2 per unit compared with ₹5.1 a unit on August 1. On August 21, the closing price was at ₹8 a unit.
Maximum power demand met did fall over the weekend from the highs last week to 214 GW as of August 20. However, with the possibility of the dry spell continuing in some regions, experts believe that demand could remain elevated at least till August end.
The power ministry had, at the beginning of the calendar year, prepared for higher demand in the summer months and directed generation companies to blend imported coal. The government mandated imported coal-based power plants to operate at full capacity, ensured sufficient rakes for fuel transport and advised generation companies to opt for rail-sea-rail
transport of
coal, among other measures.
This February was the hottest ever in a century as per the
India Meteorological Department
(
IMD
), leading to concerns over meeting anticipated summer demand in the April-June period. Unexpectedly moderate weather meant the March-May period saw less demand on average that resulted in less-than-expected depletion of coal stocks at power plants.
That led to sufficient closing stocks at plants even at the beginning of the monsoon when coal production typically slows.
Coal stocks at power plants have depleted a tad faster this month. Stocks fell to 32 million tonne from 34.9 million tonne in the first 20 days of August.
""Coal stocks are still at comfortable levels and August will
sail
through. For September, we will have to see how the demand goes from here,"" a government official said.
Since the opening stocks of coal at plants were good, the depletion hasn't had an impact.
""Preparation was for 231 GW to meet peak demand, but it has gone to 234 GW. Coal supply will not be an issue and the plants can go up to 168 GW of generation. Above that, capacity has to be available,"" the official said.

"Adani to invest Rs 2,000 cr to build 2 transmission lines in Mumbai for green energy transition",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-to-invest-rs-2000-cr-to-build-2-transmission-lines-in-mumbai-for-green-energy-transition/articleshow/102875541.cms,20-08-2023,"A senior official from
Adani Electricity Mumbai
revealed on Sunday that the company is investing over Rs 2,000 crore to build two new
transmission lines
in the city. This is part of their efforts to strengthen their network as the company moves closer to going more green by sourcing as much as 60 percent of the energy needed for the city from renewables by 2027. The two new transmission lines comprise the 84 CKm Kharghar (in Navi Mumbai) Vikhroli line in the northeastern suburb of the megalopolis and the Thane-Aarey Colony line. The Vikhroli line will be completed by 2025.
""We hope to begin the work on the project from this October. The Thane line will begin after the first line and will be commissioned in 2027,"" a senior company official, who did not want to be quoted, told PTI.
Last week, the company reached financial closure by securing Rs 1,700 crore debt from international lenders for the projects being executed by its parent
Adani Transmission
.
""We will be investing more than Rs 2,000 crore for this, of which Rs 1,700 crore will be debt-funded,"" the official said, adding the project also includes setting up a 400-kV substation which will raise the transmission capacity by 1,500 mw, as the company expects the peak demand for the megapolis to cross 5,000 mw mark by FY25 from around 4,000 mw now.
The official stated that the company has made rapid strides in improving the supply of green energy to the city where it serves more than 34 lakh customers or 6 per cent of the total consumers of the city, by increasing the supply of solar and wind power by 10 times in the past three years to 30 per cent now from only 3 per cent when three years ago.
Live Events
Asked if the
Adani
group company which entered the city's distribution business three years ago by buying out the licence from the now crippled Anil Ambani group firm
Reliance Energy
for Rs 18,000 crore, is on course to meet the recent public statement on increasing green energy mix to 60 per cent by 2027, the official answered in the affirmative saying ""very much or even earlier given what we have done so far.""
""We'll be following a hybrid model of solar and wind and given our current success the company is quite confident of making it or even bettering it,"" he said.
The transmission lines project involves developing the city's first-ever 400 kV substation facility. The Kharghar-Vikhroli project comprises 34 km of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, including a 400kV substation at Vikhroli.
He said this project is critical to the city as the existing capacity of the transmission corridor is not sufficient to carry further power into the city. This project would enable additional power of 1000 mw to be brought into
Mumbai
and would thus help in meeting the future demand of the city. Adani received the licence for the project in December 2019.
Adani Energy Solutions last Monday had also secured financial closure for another USD 1 billion from international lenders for its green transmission link project.
The company said this credit facility is part of the USD 700 million revolving project finance initiative tied up in October 2021 for its ongoing transmission assets portfolio. The credit line is coming in from DBS Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho Bank, MUFG Bank,
Siemens Bank
, Societe Generale,
StanChart
,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation
, and Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation.
As per the official, increased mix of renewable energy will help the company save 70-100 paise per unit in terms of the acquisition cost, which it will completely pass on to customers.
He also said of the 34 lakh customers, as much as 50,000 have opted to draw only green power despite that being more costly than traditional power (because of the poor load factor at night from the generation side, forcing it to source from the green grid, which will be costly.)
He said the company does not have any captive green power source in the city and thus will have to be procured.

""This has been regarded as an important milestone in the area of the power sector in the South Asian region. This has not only created a more conducive environment for attracting foreign investment in the hydropower sector but also encouraged for construction of international transmission networks to facilitate long-term power trade and to formulate reliable work plans, for which we need collaboration among the concerned ministry and all other concerned agencies,"" he further said.
Prachanda also said that to give a concrete shape to agreements reached with India, the authorities from both sides are in constant touch.
""Our concerned bodies are regularly in touch and in coordination with the Indian side. Besides, to achieve this objective necessary works for planning and construction of international transmission lines are in progress from both countries,"" he said.
""Necessary works have been expedited from both countries towards the completion of the 400 KV Butawal- Gorakhpur transmission line in the near future and I have also given instructions to formulate plans for the construction of additional two 400 KV transmission lines, Inaruwa - Purniya and Dodhara -Bareilly within two months by activating energy-secretary level mechanism,"" he said.
Prachanda also said that Nepal will come up with a policy soon on the production and utilisation of green energy.
Prachanda also said that final preparations are underway for signing an agreement among the concerned agencies of Nepal, India and Bangladesh with the aim of starting Nepal-Bangladesh power trade within this rainy season.
""A situation has arisen in which Nepal and Bangladesh can enjoy a substantial amount of power trade through forging a trilateral agreement for constructing international transmission lines,"" he said.

Adani says Abu Dhabi's TAQA is not in talks for $2.5 billion investment in power business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/abu-dhabis-taqa-says-no-truth-in-reports-of-2-5-billion-investment-in-adanis-power-business/articleshow/102826373.cms,18-08-2023,"Adani Transmission
on Friday denied reports
Abu Dhabi National Energy
Co. PJSC (
TAQA

Earlier today, ET had reported
TAQA is looking to double down in India
and is evaluating a large exposure in the expansive power businesses of Gautam Adani that span thermal generation to transmission, clean energy and green hydrogen, said people aware of the matter.
""In this regard, we wish to clarify that the Company is not engaged in any discussion with Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. PJSC (TAQA), for their investment in the Company,"" the company said in a stock exchange clarification.
TAQA has also said there's 'no truth' in the reports, according to an agency report.
Following the report, shares of Adani group firms
Adani Green Energy
, Adani Energy Solutions and
Adani Power
jumped up to 12% in Friday's trade on BSE. The stocks have come off highs and
Adani Green
Energy, Adani Energy Solutions and Adani Power were trading 6.8%, 6.3% and 7.3% at 2:40 p.m.

TAQA, among the largest integrated utilities in Europe, West Asia and Africa and also the second largest stock on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), is keen to deploy $1.5-2.5 billion in Adani Group firms or in a single entity, said the sources mentioned above. However, both sides believe there is maximum synergy between TAQA and Adani Energy Solutions, formerly Adani Transmission, to forge a strategic alliance and work together on projects in North Africa and West Asia.
TAQA is keen to pick up a stake of as much as 19.9% through a combination of primary infusion into the company and the secondary purchase of shares from promoter family entities. The current value of Adani Energy Solutions is Rs 91,660 crore with promoters owning a 68.28% stake. At current prices, a near 20% stake would be valued at Rs 18,240 crore ($2.19 billion). The stock ended flat on Thursday at Rs 821.70.
GQG Partners and its affiliates already own around 5.5% in Adani Energy Solutions as per June disclosures. Mails sent to Adani and Taqa did not generate a response.
Established in 2005, TAQA, which means energy in Arabic, has investments in power generation, transmission and distribution assets, as well as upstream and midstream oil and gas operations. Its assets are spread across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Ghana, India, Iraq, Morocco, Oman, the Netherlands, the UK and the US.
In India, TAQA owns and operates a 250 MW lignite-based thermal power plant in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu. It generates and sells power to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp. (Tangedco), the state’s power generation and distribution company. It has a presence in Himachal Pradesh, owning a majority stake in

Jakson, based on the outskirts of New Delhi, plans to have 5 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030, Chairman
Sameer Gupta
said in an interview. The generation plan is expected to cost 250 billion rupees ($3 billion), he said.
The company manufactures modules and executes turnkey contracts to build renewable energy projects, and the move into power generation will help it tap the entire value chain of the business, Gupta said.
The firm is counting on India’s ambitious plan to install 500 gigawatts of clean energy capacity by 2030. While the push has drawn interest from overseas energy giants and local billionaires including
Gautam Adani
and Mukesh Ambani, the pace of installations has fallen well short of that target, and the government has drawn up a plan to more than triple project auctions.
“We want to be a part of this expansion,” Gupta said. The company has the execution and design capability to tap the generation market, he said.

Meanwhile, Jakson is on course to double its modules-making capacity to 1.2 gigawatts over the next few months, and is exploring another location to build a 1 gigawatt cells-to-module facility, Gupta said.

Established in 2005, TAQA, which means energy in Arabic, has investments in power generation, transmission and distribution assets, as well as upstream and midstream oil and gas operations. Its assets are spread across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Ghana, India, Iraq, Morocco, Oman, the Netherlands, the UK and the US.
In India, TAQA owns and operates a 250 MW lignite-based thermal power plant in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu. It generates and sells power to the
Tamil Nadu
Generation and Distribution Corp. (Tangedco), the state’s power generation and distribution company. It has a presence in Himachal Pradesh, owning a majority stake in
NCC
Ltd’s power plant in the state.
For years, it has been planning to expand its India portfolio and even signed an agreement to buy two hydro projects from the Jaypee Group in 2014 for Rs 9,689 crore but the acquisition did not fructify with TAQA exiting the deal following a shift in global strategy. TAQA had been meeting with several Indian private utilities before zeroing in on Adani. Senior management meetings and technical due diligence are said to have taken place. However, the final financial diligence is expected over the next two-three months to zero in on the exact quantum and deal structure, said one of the executives in the know.
Adani Energy Solutions is India’s only pure-play, private-sector listed entity in the transmission and distribution sector and has already cornered 22% market share in tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) projects. The group diversified into transmission in 2015. The company has applied for second licences in three locations —
Saurashtra
, Navi Mumbai and Bulandshahr. It’s also entered the smart metering segment with an order book of Rs 5,800 crore. The company has also added cooling solutions as a business segment.
Its crown jewel is the Mumbai transmission and distribution business acquired from the Anil Ambani group in 2018 for Rs 18,800 crore, giving it access to 3.17 million of 4.2 million users in India's commercial capital. The next year, Qatar’s sovereign fund QIA bought a quarter of the Mumbai distribution company for Rs 3,200 crore, the Adani Group’s first ever investor from the Gulf.
In May, the company announced an Rs 8,500 crore qualified institutional placement. MD and CEO Anil Sardana had told ET on August 1 that the company was in touch with several investors.
“The group has been able to mobilise upwards of $8 billion in the last few months for meeting various requirements. And I guess the same investors are showing a lot of interest. So we are still talking to them,” Sardana had said.
Adani Energy Solutions has its footprint across 13 states with over 31 transmission projects and a network of 18,795 circuit km as of FY22. On the distribution side, company has integrated utilities catering to 720 circuit km in Mumbai and the Mundra SEZ. With the acquisition of distribution in Mundra, the company’s management expects strong growth opportunities and improvements in last-mile connectivity.
“Distribution is the key area where the company’s presence will multiply and aid growth. ATL (now Adani Energy Solutions) should see an 8% revenue CAGR in FY22-25E, driven by locked-in growth in both transmission and distribution business,” said Lavina Quadros and Bhaskar Chakraborty, analysts at Jefferies.
The company plans to leverage the data collected through its smart meter business, Sardana had told ET on August 3.
Going forward, the company is also planning to connect renewable energy parks to consumption areas and add high voltage direct current (HVDC) connections to cities.
On August 6, AESL achieved financial closure for its $1 billion Green HVDC link project, which will enable further greening of the Mumbai grid by supplying more renewable power to the city. HVDC transmission technology is superior to conventional methods as it stabilises power distribution networks in the event of sudden loads or blackouts in one part of the network that could lead to synchronisation problems and cascading failures.

BHEL challenges REC's plea for HEL insolvency,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bhel-challenges-recs-plea-for-hel-insolvency/articleshow/102812627.cms,18-08-2023,"State-run
Bharat Heavy Electricals
has challenged an insolvency petition filed against West Bengal-based coal power producer Hiranmaye Energy, as it will ""stall""
BHEL
's efforts to enforce a ₹388.4 crore arbitration award against the company.
BHEL has filed an application before the Kolkata bench of the
National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT), seeking cancellation of the insolvency petition filed by
REC
.
""Admission of REC's application against
HEL
would bring moratorium and the execution petition of BHEL would get stalled,' a person aware of the developments told ET. ""The only remedy in such a situation would be to file its claim before the resolution professional, which is unlikely to be converted to cash.""
REC's petition under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code pertains to default on repayment of ₹2,500 crore debt.
BHEL's case against HEL is related to encashment of bank guarantees tendered by BHEL for an award of commissioning boiler turbine generator for 450 MW (3x150 MW) coal-based power plant at Haldia in West Bengal. BHEL won the award in October 2010 but the construction could begin only in March 2014 owing to delays in financial closure.
Live Events
BHEL claims that it was not allowed to commission the project in November 2017 despite readying two units and rectifying issues of turbine stabilisation.

Though a formal agreement is yet to be signed among the three countries, PPA and other terms are agreed upon through email, he made it clear.
According to Bhattarai India is positive regarding supplying electricity from Nepal to Bangladesh through using its transmission line.
However, without India's consent this cannot take place, he pointed out.
The supplying 40 MW of electricity from Nepal to Bangladesh via India is not substantial in volume but it is significant because it holds symbolic value, officials here said.
The agreement to export Nepal's electricity to the third country is itself a significant one, said Ganesh Karki, President of the Independent Power Producers' Association.
Some pending issues regarding the agreement are expected to be finalised shortly, the sources said. Bangladesh is planning to purchase 9,000 MW of electricity from Nepal in the long run.
During the fifth meeting of the secretary-level Joint Steering Committee on energy cooperation between Nepal and Bangladesh in May, the two sides agreed to start trading of power by taking India on board.

NCLT approves Vedanta's bid to acquire Meenakshi Energy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nclt-approves-vedantas-bid-to-acquire-meenakshi-energy/articleshow/102781347.cms,17-08-2023,"Mumbai:
Vedanta
's bid to acquire
Meenakshi Energy
through the insolvency resolution process was approved by the
Hyderabad National Company Law Tribunal
last week.
The Anil Agarwal company offered ₹1,440 crore against admitted claims of ₹4,625 crore, equating to a 31% recovery, distributed among lenders, trade creditors and employees.
Two other bidders -
Jindal Power
and a consortium of Prudent Asset Reconstruction Company with Vizag Minerals - were also in the fray for the distressed thermal plant, court documents show. Government-promoted
National Asset Reconstruction Company
offered ₹1,003 crore to acquire lenders' debt, as reported by ET on November 1, 2022. However, lenders declined the offer as Vedanta's was higher.
Vedanta's resolution plan stands approved by a majority of 94.96% of the committee of creditors (CoC), according to an order uploaded by the bankruptcy court.
Vedanta submitted a plan on August 29, 2022, which was amended on October 28. Again, on December 26, Vedanta submitted an improved offer - from ₹650 crore to ₹1,440 crore, the court order showed.
Live Events
However, lenders did not immediately approve Vedanta's offer. They decided to give other bidders an equal opportunity to submit an improved offer. On December 29, they decided to run a challenge process, wherein Vedanta emerged as the highest bidder, as reported by ET on January 7.
Of the ₹1,440 crore offer, lenders will receive ₹1,143 crore against their admitted claims of ₹3,778 crore, implying a recovery of 30%. Vedanta will make an upfront payment of ₹312 crore and the balance will be staggered over five to seven years.
Vedanta's offer is above the average liquidation value, pegged at ₹1,100 crore but below the average fair value pegged at ₹2,150 crore.
The division bench comprising Justice Telaprolu Rajani (judicial) and Charan Singh (technical) rejected a plea filed by Devi Trading and Holding, a minor CoC member. It appealed that the plan offered by Vedanta is not feasible and did not adequately balance the interest of all stakeholders. The court ruled the plea was 'baseless and false and thus denied.'
India Power Corporation
(IPCL), which provided a corporate guarantee for Meenakshi Energy is part owned by Aksara Commercial, according to stock exchange disclosures. In February 2016, Srei promoter Hemant Kanoria announced the acquisition of Meenakshi Energy from Engie Group of France for $1.
Meenakshi Energy's project cost is estimated at ₹7,583 crore, which includes debt of ₹3,473 crore and an equity contribution of ₹4,110 crore, according to the information memorandum circulated by the resolution professional.
The project has two phases: Phase I has two units of 150 MW each, and Phase II has two of 350 MW each. Phase I is dependent on imported coal for production and is operational, while Phase II is commissioned but not operational and is dependent on both domestic and imported coal. The power generating units are located adjacent to Adani's Krishnapatnam port in Andhra Pradesh.
Meenakshi Energy had a long-term power purchase agreement with Bangladesh, but it was terminated in November 2021.

Nepal PM likely to sign power pact with China during Sept trip
Global solar power grid to mitigate emission challenges: PM Modi
Govt has started trade with neighbouring countries in INR, says Anupriya Patel
An MoU has been signed between India and Sri Lanka to enhance electric connectivity and promote the use of renewables, especially wind energy.
""Nepal is seeking investments from India to develop its hydro potential. Although Nepal has significant potential, it has yet to tap into it fully,"" he said.
Nepal prime minister has invited Indian companies to participate in developing this potential and has requested India to purchase surplus power.
India, despite being a power-surplus country, has committed to purchasing 10,000 MW of power from Nepal.
Regarding the expedited progress of 12 hydro projects in Arunachal Pradesh, Singh mentioned the importance of maintaining balance on India's side.
""This is crucial because on the other side of the border, construction of large dams are underway, which could pose a future threat without sufficient infrastructure on the Indian side.""
Singh also noted that an investment of around 1.5 lakh crore in a state with a population of approximately 70 lakh would significantly boost the locals' per capita income.

Nepal wants to develop a cross-border transmission line with China via the border district of Rasuwa, which is expected to be signed during Prachanda's visit, according to Kathmandu-based sources. Nepal also wants to learn best practices in agriculture from China while simultaneously engaging with India in the same sector, according to one of sources quoted above.
Addressing a public function in Nepal's Chitwan on Saturday, Prachanda said there will be a new power trading agreement with China, according to a
Kathmandu Post
report. ""We have had very positive talks with China and Bangladesh with regard to the power trading agreements. We will sign separate understandings with the two countries soon. There is an agreement to export power to Bangladesh via India and we are planning to sign the agreement in
Kathmandu
at a special function,"" Prachanda said, according to the Kathmandu Post report.
Prachanda, who visited India in June, also said, ""I am soon sending a team to India to discuss how we can cooperate in the agriculture sector. We have also agreed to set up a chemical fertiliser industry in Nepal with India's support.""
In the recent past, Kathmandu had been rocked by incidents of alleged Chinese-backed crime syndicates involved in gold smuggling. Last week, several Chinese nationals were arrested in Nepal over a gold smuggling scam, according to Kathmandu- based sources. The gold meant for India was sourced from Hong Kong, alleged one of the above-mentioned sources. Nepal's Department of Revenue Investigation had on July 18 seized a huge quantity of gold from Sinamangal, Kathmandu after the consignment had passed the airport customs undetected, and had launched an investigation.

The
Ministry of Power
had estimated 229GW of peak power demand during the summers this year. But the data showed that peak power demand remained at 224.10GW in April-July 2023.
The ministry took many steps and asked imported coal-based plants to run at 100 per cent capacity as well as directed domestic coal-based plants to import coal for blending to ensure adequate power supply in the country.
The industry experts are of the view that the electricity output growth would improve July onwards.
The latest
Central Electricity Authority
(CEA) data showed that power consumption has grown by 6.4 per cent to 136.44 billion units in July this year, from 128.25 billion units in the same month of 2022.

He pointed that, on the one hand, they will give a tremendous boost to the growth and the development of the state and on the other, they will augment the country’s energy security through clean and green energy.
He exhorted the stakeholders to implement these projects in a mission mode in the overall interest of the state and the nation.
Lauding the role of CPSUs, Khandu said, “The role of CPSUs has been commendable. State has already received free power to the extent of Rs 1183 crores from the Panyor Lower, Pare and Kameng Hydro Electric Projects. This quantum is going to further increase in 2023-24, as Subansiri Lower HEP 2000 MW is scheduled to be commissioned in a phased manner from January 2024 onwards.”
Khandu further informed that the State government has initiated the ‘Golden Jubilee Border Village Electrification Programme’.
“Under this initiative, we will provide stable power supply to our villages and defense establishments along the remote international border through stand alone micro hydel projects. Over a period of three years, we will undertake 50 such projects and 13 projects have already been commissioned in Phase 1,” he added.
Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein said that the projects will bring unprecedented development and employment opportunities in the state. He said that the state will earn Rs. 3052 crores annually from the 12% free power component from the projects.
“Additionally, we will also earn Rs. 254 crores annually for the Local Area Development Fund,” he added.
The projects will be developed in partnership with the State Government which will have a 26% equity share. The dividends from this equity participation will further augment the State’s earnings from the projects.
Earlier, while welcoming the participants, Chief Secretary Dharmendra expressed how the State is a front runner towards meeting Prime Minister’s commitment of producing at least 50% of energy through renewable sources by 2030.

NEEPCO abandons 500 MW thermal power project in Meghalaya,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/neepco-abandons-500-mw-thermal-power-project-in-meghalaya/articleshow/102618557.cms,10-08-2023,"The
North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited
(
NEEPCO
) has conveyed its decision to withdraw from the implementation of a proposed 500 megawatt
thermal power
project in
Meghalaya
.
According to Power Minister AT Mondal, NEEPCO communicated its intention to terminate the thermal power project, highlighting a shift in focus towards exclusively green and clean energy endeavours.
Mondal said that the decision was reached during discussions with the Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of NEEPCO, who also holds the CMD position at
NTPC
in New Delhi.
The minister underscored that a primary challenge with thermal power projects lies in securing a dependable coal linkage.
He emphasized that without a guaranteed supply of coal, significant investments could result in futility. The allure of benefits provided by hydel power projects, such as 3% free power allocation and 1% power allocation for local area development, is absent in the context of thermal power initiatives.

Mondal acknowledged the need to evaluate proposals for power projects, but highlighted a substantial hurdle: the expectation of private parties that the government will procure 100% of the generated power. This requirement poses a significant obstacle to the feasibility of these projects.
In parallel, the minister divulged discussions with NTPC regarding power generation from waste materials. However, he revealed that the quantity of waste generated isn't sufficient to render the project economically viable.

Pumped hydro storage and battery
energy storage
systems have been identified by the government as being essential for balancing the grid with renewable energy addition.
While battery energy storage systems have a high cost resulting in higher electricity cost, pumped storage is cheaper and a low-hanging fruit with proven technology and timeline.
Pumped hydro storage is a two-reservoir system at different elevations that acts like a giant battery for storing power.
NHPC’s annual capital expenditure target for the company is Rs 10,000 crore for the ongoing financial year, Goyal said.
The company’s consolidated hydro projects capacity under construction are currently at 9,314 MW. Of this, 2,000 MW Subansiri Lower in Arunachal Pradesh is likely to be commissioned by December 2024 and 800-MW Parbati-II by March 2024, Goyal said.
Dibang multipurpose project with an estimated capacity of 2,880 MW may be commissioned by February 2032.
The company has been allocated to develop 2000-MW Subansiri upper and 1,800 MW Subansiri middle projects in Arunachal Pradesh, as reported earlier by ET.
Memoranda of understanding could be signed with the state this year, Goyal said.
Solar projects of 1,000 MW is also being set up by the company which it expects to get commissioned by October 2025.

India has set an ambitious energy transition programme, which includes having 500 GW of renewable energy capacity, by 2030.
""No Sir,
Central Electricity Authority
vide an advisory dated January 20, 2023 suggested that no retirement or repurposing of coal-based power stations will be done before 2030 considering the expected energy demand scenario and availability of capacity in future,"" Power Minister R K Singh said in a written reply to
Rajya Sabha
.
He was replying to a question on whether the government has formulated any plan to phase out the old coal-based thermal power plants in the country, including in Odisha.
Singh said that operators of thermal power plants were also advised implementation of Renovations & Modernisation (R&M) and Life Extension (LE) of their units for running up to 2030 and beyond or operating in two-shift mode to facilitate olar and wind energy integration into the grid, wherever feasible.
Power generation is a delicensed activity as per Section 7 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and phasing out/retirement of units is decided by power generating companies based on their own techno-economic and environmental reasons, the minister explained.

Further, he said that in order to achieve higher efficiencies and to reduce carbon footprint, a large number of thermal power plants operating in the country have already adopted super-critical/ ultra super-critical technologies.
As on date, 94 coal-based thermal units of total capacity of 65,150 MW are operating with super-critical/ultra super-critical technologies, Singh said.
In another written reply, Singh said that power generation from coal-based power plants increased to 1,145.90 billion units in 2022-23 from 1,041.48 billion units in 2021-22.
Coal
imports increased to 55.6 million tonnes in 2022-23 from 27 million tonnes in 2021-22, he said.
The coal imports stood at 14.2 million tonnes during April-June this year.
In another written reply, Singh said, ""in the
Budget

Pumped Storage Projects
. At present, there are no plans to provide viability gap funding for Pumped Hydro Storage Projects.""
About sharing the cess of Rs 400 per tonne of coal with the states for the development of pumped storage projects, the minister said, ""there is no such proposal under consideration.""
Regarding Unnat
Jyoti
by Affordable LED for All (UJALA) scheme, the minister said that under it, the total quantity of energy efficient and affordable LED bulbs and LED tubelights distributed by EESL during the last five years is 7.4 crore and 10.23 lakh, respectively.
This has resulted in an estimated annual energy savings of 9.64 billion units (kWh), he added.

TD Power has to come clean on case against promoters: Proxy advisory firm,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/td-power-has-to-come-clean-on-case-against-promoters-proxy-advisory-firm/articleshow/102480504.cms,07-08-2023,"Proxy advisory entity InGovern Research said Bangalore-based engineering services company
TD Power Systems
must disclose all the facts to its shareholders prior to the Annual General Meeting on August 9 regarding the case filed by a group led by Vijay
Kirloskar
of
Kirloskar Electric Company
against
promoters
, including Mohib Khericha and Nikhil Kumar among others in the Karnataka High Court. Kirloskar had founded
TD Power
in 1999
On June 30, promoters and promoter groups, including Khericha, Kumar, Chartered Capital, Saphire Finman Services LLP, and Hitoshi Matsuo, sold around 3.78 crore shares representing 24.21% of TD Power in the open market. Promoters, which held a 58.5% stake in the company before the transaction, now hold 34.30%.
Last month, the High Court of Karnataka restrained the company’s chairman Mohib Khericha, and several others from transferring 2.51 crore TD Power shares held by promoter entity Saphire Finman Services. The court passed the interim order on a petition by Vijay Kirloskar.
Kirloskar, along with
Kirloskar Electric
Welfare Trusts, had moved the High Court to stop Khericha and others who hold 2.51 crore shares in the company through Saphire Finman Services not to transfer or sell them in the stock market.
According to news reports, Kriloskar had transferred his ownership of the shares to Khericha for holding them on his behalf. In the petition, it was alleged Khericha had failed to comply with an agreement to return the shares to Kirloskar.
Live Events
In an exchange filing on July 21, the company said Khericha, his family members and entities controlled by him had acquired some shares from Vijay Kirloskar and the trust for consideration over a period of time. It further said, as per the company’s records, there is no transfer of shares from Vijay Kirloskar and the other petitioners to Khericha.
InGovern Research has recommended that shareholders vote against the proposed resolution seeking Khericha's reappointment as a director. However, the other two proxy advisory firms, such as Institutional Investors Advisory Services (IiAS) and Shareholder Empowerment Services (SES), recommended investors vote in favour of the resolution.
InGovern Research said the company, in the director's report, did not make any mention of the ongoing suit filed by Vijay Kirloskar for a breach of trust and cheating on the part of its chairman Mohib Khericha seeking an order to return 2.51 crore shares of TDPS held in the trust by Khericha and his family members on behalf of Vijay Kirloskar.
An email query sent to TD Power and Vijay Kirloskar did not elicit any response till press time.
Shares of TD Power, a leading manufacturer of generators and motors for the power sector, rallied 47% in the last three months and 125% in the last one year.
InGovern has asked shareholders to seek the appointment of an independent and reputed external entity to conduct a forensic audit of the affairs of the company, including an investigation and verification of all records, books of accounts, and the conduct of the board of directors.
On June 30, shares sold by the promoters were acquired by institutional investors like Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, BNP Paribas, HDFC MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Goldman Sachs
LIC
MF, Mahindra MF, Mirae MF, Oxbow Master Fund, Quant MF, Societe Generale among others.

Anil Ambani-owned Vidarbha Industries moves Bombay High Court against lenders' move to auction company's debt,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/anil-ambani-owned-vidarbha-industries-moves-bombay-high-court-against-lenders-move-to-auction-companys-debt/articleshow/102438355.cms,05-08-2023,"Mumbai: Anil Ambani-owned
Vidarbha Industries
Power has petitioned the Bombay High Court objecting to a decision by its
lenders
to auction the company's debt, court documents show.
Banks led by
Axis Bank
have scheduled a Swiss Challenge auction to sell principal debt of ₹2,569 crore and $27.7 million in overseas currency loans of the distressed power company on August 8.
Last month, lenders rejected a ₹1,260-crore one-time settlement the promoter offered and chose CFM Asset Reconstruction Company's ₹1,220 crore offer as an anchor bid for the Swiss auction.
On August 2, a division bench of Justice GS Patel and Justice Neela Gokhale adjourned the matter to August 30 for further hearing.
Vidarbha Industries Power and its affiliate
Rosa Power Supply
approached the court on June 20 through law firm Mulla & Mulla & Craigie Blunt & Caroe. The power producer has filed a petition against Axis Bank and the Reserve Bank of India, represented by Khaitan & Co.
Live Events
Senior counsels Harish Salve and Prateek Seksaria appeared for Vidarbha Industries while senior counsels Janak Dwarkadas and Venkatesh Dhond appeared for Axis Bank and RBI. Senior officials from
Anil Ambani
group declined to comment on the matter.
Lenders have shortlisted Aditya Birla ARC, Avenue Capital-backed Asset Reconstruction Company of India (Arcil), and
Reliance ARC
as eligible candidates to submit counter offers at the Swiss auction.
The High Court has not granted a stay, and the next hearing is scheduled August 30. So, it is likely that lenders will go ahead with the auction, said a legal expert. As an anchor bidder, CFM ARC will have the first right to match the highest offer that lenders receive on August 8.
Vidarbha Industries operates two coal-based units of 300mw each at the Butibori industrial area in Nagpur. It had a power purchase agreement with Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Infrastructure. In 2017, it sold the Mumbai distribution business to Adani Transmission.
Vidarbha had a coal supply agreement with Western Coalfields Ltd for one 300mw unit and it purchased coal for another unit from the market. However, after Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd terminated the PPA, WCL also cancelled its contract. The matter is under dispute and pending a hearing from the Supreme Court.
The battle to acquire the power producer has stoked expectations of a quick recovery for lenders disheartened by the Supreme Court order rejecting a plea to admit the company for insolvency proceedings despite a default.
Last July, the apex court dismissed Axis Bank's petition to admit Vidarbha Industries for insolvency, stating that the National Company Law Tribunal, which approved admitting the company, should have considered external factors that had led to the delay in payments by the borrower.
At the heart of the matter is a claim made by Vidarbha Industries that has won an award of ₹1,730 crore from the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity. This amount exceeded the ₹553 crore claimed by Axis Bank.

The company said installed capacity grew from 13,650 MW as of June 30, 2022 to 15,250 MW as of June 30, 2023 after commissioning of the 1,600 MW Godda ultra-supercritical power plant, which supplies power to Bangladesh.
During the quarter, power plants at Udupi, Raipur,
Raigarh
and Mahan achieved an increase in PLF, while power plants at Mundra, Tiroda and Kawai achieved lower PLF due to erratic weather conditions, leading to back down from discoms. Incremental generation capacity of the Godda plant contributed to the increase in sales volumes for Q1 FY 2023-24, the company said in a statement.

Adani Transmission Ltd
changed its name to Adani Energy
Solutions Ltd
. The company, which reported an 8% increase or Rs 182 crore in profit after tax for the quarter ended June 2023, is focusing on B2C engagement with commercial and industrial consumers.
Managing Director
Anil Sardana
tells ET the new name manifests the company's strengths.
Excerpts:
Why did
Adani Transmission
become
Adani Energy
Solutions?
We started transmission business in 2015 when the company started and by 2018, we added the first distribution business. We had done exceedingly well in the transmission business. Then we added the Mundra Utility business, and then subsequently came several other opportunities in terms of smart meters and several captive customers coming into our fold. So, we started to provide solutions to the last mile customers also. We said it's better that we become future ready in that energy in future will not only be electricity but will perhaps be also green hydrogen and its different derivatives and customers will therefore seek solutions using all these aspects. So, we decided that let's manifest our strength in the name itself, and therefore we decided to change the name.
So, what will solutions encompass?
Now, as we go along, we will have transmission continue to grow healthier, and better. We will also grow on the distribution side. We have applied for second licences in three different locations. Two are contiguous to our existing business. One is in Saurashtra, second in Navi Mumbai and third one in Ghaziabad to Jewar and
Bulandshahr
. In the smart metering segment, we have already had early success with an order book of ₹5,800 crore. Similarly, we have added cooling solutions as one of the businesses, as in the next 10 years the country will need a maximum amount of electricity and energy to cater to cooling solutions.
Why smart metering?
Live Events
So, the retail distribution will see a lot of customer base. We have 3 million customers in Mumbai, we have several large customers in Mundra area and with the second licence we will have so many customers there. We are going to be putting these smart meters for the customers. So, we will have a lot of customer data that will enable us to analyse and provide services and upsell and cross sell inputs to various benefactors. Similarly, the large energy guzzlers and energy consumers will see us providing them solutions far more competitive compared to what they get from their existing service providers. For instance, smart meters on the electricity side give you the whole (consumption) pattern. Every quality of life imperative can be known through smart meters. We also tell the customers that they can save money by flattening their (consumption) curve.
AESL has laid a huge national transmission line network. What is the way forward from here?
Now that we are a pan-India player, we are shifting orbit by virtue of three things. One, we will connect a lot of renewable energy parks to the consumption areas. Because, from 110 gigawatt the country will move to 500 GW by 2030. So, that's a large bulk corridor that one will really add. Two, when you add renewable power, you also add challenges because this works only when the sun shines or when the wind blows. So, there are challenges from the grid point of view. We will therefore add a lot of elements in terms of how we really manage switching on and switching off some of these large generating facilities. The third is the advent of high voltage DC (HVDC) and direct connection to cities. HVDC is a new concept that exists today. Now we will have HVDC systems because of the changing paradigms between large guzzlers of energy. To evacuate the power to nearby consumptive areas one will use these HVDC corridors. We did our first HVDC station between Gujarat and Haryana. So, it is akin to saying that the power station doesn't exist in Gujarat but in
Haryana
because in HVDC, nobody can tap in between. They get the benefit as if the powerhouse is sitting right in Haryana. And this, you will see more and more being added. So, this is the third element.

Juniper Green Energy crosses 1.2GW of renewable energy capacity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/juniper-green-energy-crosses-1-2gw-of-renewable-energy-capacity/articleshow/102311267.cms,01-08-2023,"Renewable energy
producer
Juniper Green Energy
on Tuesday said it has crossed 1.2GW of renewable energy generating capacity. Juniper Green Energy crossed 1.2 GW of
renewable energy capacity
with the recent PPAs/LOAs (power purchase agreements and letter of award) secured in the last few months, a company statement said.
The company, an independent renewable energy power producer and operator of solar, wind and hybrid power projects, was recently awarded 190 MW of Wind capacity from
GUVNL
and 105 MW of Solar capacity from MSEDCL at an average tariff of Rs 3.00 (around USD 0.037) per kWh, it said.
These projects were awarded through competitive bidding, followed by an e-Reverse auction held by
Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited
(GUVNL) and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL).
As per bid terms, PPA shall be signed between the entities for 25 years, and the projects will be commissioned within 18-24 months. Additionally, the company has started construction on its first ISTS solar power project of 140MW capacity under the merchant/C&I route.
These combined projects will produce 1.4 billion kWh of clean energy per year, leading to a reduction of approx 1.3 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually. Additionally, these projects have the potential to provide green energy to power 2.8 Lacs households.

India's power consumption grows by 8.4 pc to 139 billion units in July,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-grows-by-8-4-pc-to-139-billion-units-in-july/articleshow/102310695.cms,01-08-2023,"NEW DELHI: The country's
power consumption
grew by 8.4 per cent to 139 billion units in July this year compared to the same month last year. In the year-ago period, power consumption stood at 128.25 billion units (BU), higher than 123.72 BU in July 2021, according to the government data.
The
peak power demand
met, which is the highest supply in a day, rose to 208.82 GW in July 2023. The peak power supply stood at 190.35 GW in July 2022 and 200.53 GW in July 2021.
The power ministry had estimated the country's electricity demand to touch 229 GW during the summer season. But the demand did not reach the projected level in April-May this year due to
unseasonal rains
.
Power consumption was affected in March, April, May and June this year due to widespread rains in the country.
Experts said that unseasonal rains in March, April, May and June affected the power consumption in the country. However, they said that the power consumption growth was not that bad in June this year and improved significantly in July.
Live Events
Rains reduced the demand for electricity as people used fewer cooling appliances compared to the previous year, according to experts.
However, they said that the power consumption and demand surged in July due extreme humid conditions which resulted in use of cooling appliances like air conditioners for longer hours in a day.
Further, experts had expressed hope that power consumption and demand would grow in August due to further improvement in economic activities as well as high humidity levels.

"'IL&FS Tamil Nadu power has Rs 3,000 cr of cash and a hurdle to resolution'",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ilfs-tamil-nadu-power-has-rs-3000-cr-of-cash-and-a-hurdle-to-resolution/articleshow/102289621.cms,01-08-2023,"The Rs 9,000-crore debt resolution of IL&FS Tamil Nadu Power Company (
ITPCL
) has been deadlocked with lenders demanding the distribution of cash with the company before a restructuring plan can be implemented.
Although the broad contours of a restructuring plan have been agreed upon, its implementation hinges on approval from individual lenders as well as the
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal
(
NCLAT
), people familiar with the matter said.
ITPCL is a special purpose vehicle promoted by IL&FS, with a 3,180 MW coal-based thermal power plant at Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. The company is currently operating a 1,200 MW (2x600 MW) capacity. If resolved, this will be one of the largest accounts of the infrastructure and finance company which collapsed in September 2018.
Lenders want the company to distribute close to ₹3,000 crore of cash with the power producer before considering the restructuring plan.
""The cash has been collected in the company over the last five years or so and can be distributed before the approvals of restructuring are given. But the company wants to get all approvals for the restructuring first which is where there is a deadlock,"" said a person familiar with the situation.
Live Events
ET Bureau
There are 17 lenders to the company led by
Punjab National Bank
and including
Union Bank of India
,
Bank of India
,
Bank of Baroda
and
SBI
.
The restructuring plan has classified about ₹6,000 crore of sustainable debt that can be recovered. About a year ago, responding to a petition by operational creditors of the company, the NCLAT had directed lenders to also offer a ""fair and reasonable"" settlement to these operational creditors.
""The restructuring plan envisages a recovery of about 34% or ₹450 crore on total dues of ₹1,300 crore of operational creditors. For the sustainable debt of financial creditors, the recovery expected is 52%. The cut-off date for the plan was set as April 2021. Payments for operational creditors have to happen within five years while for financial creditors the timeline is 13 years,"" said a person aware of the details.
According to
RBI
rules, 60% of the lenders by value or 75% by number have to ratify the plan following which it has to be submitted to the NCLAT.
An IL&FS spokesperson confirmed that the restructuring plan is being worked out for the account.
""The final restructuring proposal of ITPCL's debt, covering both financial and operational creditors as directed by NCLAT as per the order passed in July 2022, is underway and the approval by lenders is expected soon. Once it (lenders approval) is received, ITPCL will approach NCLAT for necessary approval to implement the final debt restructuring proposal,"" the spokesperson said.
Each lender will have to take internal approvals for the plan to be implemented until a majority of lenders are on board, people familiar with the process said.

insolvency
plea filed by
SBI
. The power transmission company had defaulted on payments amounting to ₹6,500 crore to various banks and other creditors. However, the resolution process is still ongoing and the company's resolution professional filed an application requesting a fresh valuation of EMC to determine its fair value as of April 20, 2022, which has been rejected.

The reason cited by EMC was that the company had undergone the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) starting from November 12, 2018, during which a resolution plan was approved but not implemented by the successful applicant.
Due to this, the Adjudicating Authority ordered a limited reboot of the CIRP from the stage of calling the EoI on April 20 2018. However, the court rejected the proposal of revaluation, stating that the decision in this unique case must be taken by the Committee of Creditors (
CoC
) based on the available information and their commercial judgment.
The resolution professional had said that during the last four years, the company has completed 22 out of 32 projects in hand, which would have let to a change in valuation While the
NCLT
noted that the primary objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (
IBC
) is value maximisation, and the CoC's decision-making should align with this goal.

During April-June 2023 period, 4,07,762 million units of electricity was supplied against the demand of 4,08,621 million units leaving a deficit of 858 million units or 0.2 per cent, the minister said in another written reply to the House.
There is adequate availability of electricity in the country. There is a negligible gap between energy requirement and energy supplied on account of factors attributable to discoms such as constraints in distribution network, financial constraints, commercial reasons etc., Singh stated.

""HPX has got approval from CERC for the introduction of high price contracts in three key markets: High Price Day Ahead Market (HP-DAM), High Price Term Ahead Market (HP-TAM), and High Price Contingency Contracts,"" HPX said in a statement.
The high price contingency contracts will provide added stability to the energy market during periods of volatility.

With the fresh alternative of HP-TAM, these high price generators can plan for sale of their power to interested beneficiaries under longer term contracts of up to 90 days, it said.
This would give them an opportunity to secure fuel supply in advance and plan their operations basis the underlying contracts, moving away from the sole dependency on clearance in the DAM segment, it explained.
""With the CERC nod to introduce high price contracts on HPX, we have been successful in delivering two new products for the power market within a short time-span of just one year of starting our business operations in July last year. Till date these high-price generators had just one option to sell power, that is through participation in the HP-DAM segment,"" Naveen Singh, Vice President & Head, Business Development, HPX said.
With these new segments, the generators can plan their power sale to interested buyers for up to 90 days, giving HP-generators sufficient clarity to plan their fuel procurement, logistics etc, he said.
This also ensures a level playing field across different market segments, gives more choice to the consumers and promotes competition, he added.

infrastructure
projects, state-owned
Power Finance Corporation
is looking to venture into funding ports, airports, refineries, and metros in addition to its traditional lending to utilities. The power financier has also earmarked 20% of its borrowing for foreign markets and will be exploring US dollar, euro and yen-denominated issuances, said
Parminder Chopra
, director-finance in an interview with
ET
. Edited excerpts:
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
Your ongoing issue is the first public issue launched since January 2021. What prompted it now and can we expect more such issues this year?
In 2021 we took a significant step and decided to make the public at large to be a partner in the growth story of the
Indian power sector
. We were the first public sector company to launch a public issue of
NCDs
. The simple idea was to let everyone participate, we are looking forward to the energy transition and that will satisfy all the investors who are part of the growth story. With respect to future issuances, it all depends on the market conditions and also the appetite and response of the investors. For this particular issue, this is the first tranche. Rs 500 crore is the base issue size with an option to retain Rs 4,500 crore as a greenshoe option. So, depending on the response, we will take a further call.
Last year,
PFC
was permitted to finance infrastructure projects. How much has been disbursed on that front and what can we expect in the current year?
Our primary focus in any case is on the power sector and energy transition. But, last year, in the second half of the financial year, we were allowed to fund the infrastructure sector with a 30% cap. Last year the total sanctions made under the infrastructure sector was Rs 15,000 crore approximately. And now also we are exploring the possibility. We intend to fund ports, airports, refineries, and metros, all these avenues are open for us. Gradually we will be going for the infrastructure sector. When it comes to the quantum —when there is a cap of 30%, we would not like it to be exhausted immediately in two to three years. We would like to grow our portfolio in the infrastructure sector because that’s new for us.
So far in the current year, you had a healthy pipeline of bond issuances. What is the total borrowing that you are looking at in FY24?

PFC eyes up to Rs 5,000 crore via public issue of bonds
For FY24, we have got our borrowing plan approved from the board for Rs 80,000 crore. That will be spread over the year based on our disbursements and the fund requirements of the company.
Typically, around 15-20% of your borrowing is conducted through foreign markets. When will you next tap the overseas bond markets? Could you share a timeline and a broad quantum?
As you pointed out, of the outstanding borrowing we have approximately 20% from the foreign market and that’s aregular process for PFC. Last year, we raised the equivalent of $850 million in yen. This year also, going forward, we will be looking (to raise). The market conditions shall prevail over whatever our plan is. It’s a continuous process for us. We keep on exploring the market through syndicated loans and bonds. As and when we get the opportunity, we will do it. The choice of currency is purely a market dynamic.
Whatever opportunities we have — generally our borrowing is in dollars, euro, and yen. And we expect that primarily we are going to continue with these three major currencies.
What is your reading of prevailing market rates? You said earlier that you would look to maintain a spread of 250-275 bps. Does it still stand?

Lenders have shortlisted
Aditya Birla ARC

Reliance
ARC as eligible candidates to submit counter offers for the sale of the distressed power company, the people said.
Banks have preferred
CFM

CFM
ARC

Reliance Power

Rare ARC's expression of interest was rejected, one of the persons cited above said. While inviting bids, process advisor
SBI
Caps stipulated that EoI applicants should submit ₹10 lakh as a non-refundable bid process participation fee. ""This is a very unusual condition aimed at discouraging potential bidders,"" said a senior official from an ARC.

Lenders have stipulated that counteroffers should be 5% higher than the anchor offer of ₹1,220 crore.
The company has a principal debt of ₹2,569 crore and $26.7 million (₹220 crore) as on July 6, a document circulated by lenders inviting counteroffers stated.
Axis Bank
,
State Bank of India
,
Punjab National Bank
,
Bank of Baroda
,
Canara Bank
and
Bank of Maharashtra
are the lenders.
Vidarbha operates two coal-based units of 300 MW each at the Butibori industrial area in Nagpur. It had a power purchase agreement (PPA) with
Reliance Infrastructure
. In 2017, it sold the Mumbai distribution business to
Adani Transmission
.
Vidarbha had a coal supply pact with Western Coalfields for one 300 MW unit and it purchased coal for another unit from the market. However after Adani Electricity Mumbai terminated the PPA, WCL also cancelled its contract. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
The battle to acquire the power producer has stoked expectations of a quick recovery for lenders disheartened by the Supreme Court order rejecting a plea to admit it for insolvency proceedings despite a default.
Last July, the apex court dismissed Axis Bank's petition to admit Vidarbha for insolvency, stating that the National Company Law Tribunal, which approved admitting the company, should have considered external factors that had led to the delay in payments by the borrower.
At the heart of the matter is a claim made by Vidarbha that it won an award of ₹1,730 crore from the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity. This exceeded the ₹553 crore claimed by Axis Bank.
Reliance
Power claimed it could not repay because the Maharashtra electricity regulator challenged the award. The case is now pending at the apex court.

The formal MoA signing ceremony would be held next month, where Union Power Minister R K Singh is likely to attend.
The state government has so far terminated 44 memorandums of agreement (MoAs) with various private power developers as they ""showed less interest"" in executing projects allotted to them.
The projects which have been withdrawn from private developers would be handed over to central public sector understandings (CPSUs) and accordingly, fresh MoAs would be signed soon, Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein, who also holds the power portfolio, had said recently.
""After the allotments, progress in many projects could not be achieved due to various reasons. Despite serving several notices to private developers concerned, they were not inclined to execute the projects, for which, 44 MoAs have been terminated,"" Mein had said.
The state government is regularly pursuing the matter of hydropower development with the Centre and as a result, the central government in its recent decision prepared an indicative list of 29 projects, the deputy chief minister disclosed.
Mein on July 19 held a meeting with the Union Power minister at New Delhi and discussed the progress made in various steps leading to the transfer of
power projects
from private developers to CPSUs and informed the minister about the headway achieved by the state government in this regard.
Four CPSUs have been identified for the purpose - Neepco Ltd,
Nhpc Ltd
,
Sjvn Ltd
and Thdc India Ltd, the official said.
The transfer process has been carefully designed in consultation with various stakeholders, including the Centre and is set to culminate with the signing of MoAs, the official said.
The state government has decided to transfer 13 projects with an installed capacity of 12,623 MW to CPSUs including, two to NHPC, one project to Tehri Hydro Development Corporation (THDC) Ltd, five to Northeast Electrical Power Corporation (NEEPCO) Ltd and five to Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) Ltd, respectively.
The NHPC is already constructing the 2,000 MW Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project at Gerukamukh in the Assam-Arunachal boundary, which is nearing commissioning and has recently started construction of the 2,880 MW Dibang Multipurpose Project on river Dibang in the state.

Oppenheimer and the business of nuclear power,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/oppenheimer-and-the-business-of-nuclear-power/articleshow/102014866.cms,21-07-2023,"Christopher Nolan's much-awaited movie '
Oppenheimer
', a biopic on the eponymous American physicist who created the first atomic bomb, comes at a time when the world is once again zoomed into the nuclear issue.
The
Russia-Ukraine war
risks turning into a global nuclear conflict; the war threatens accidental hit or sabotage at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia
Nuclear Power
Plant, which is occupied by Russian forces; and the world is conflicted between the atomic fears and the need for clean and more energy. Some countries are pulling the plug on nuclear reactors while others are rushing in the opposite direction.
The undecidedness about nuclear energy is in stark contrast to J. Robert Oppenheimer's Bhagavad Gita-inspired equanimity about his creation of the atom bomb. Even though he did show the Arjuna-like guilt after the bombings of
Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, saying he had blood on his hands, he never regretted his act.
Facing the nuclear moment
As the world, gripped with the dark prospect of global warming, races to cut carbon emissions in various ways and desperately tries to produce energy from green renewable sources such as wind and solar, it remains conflicted about nuclear power, an effective alternative to conventional energy from fossil fuels. The challenge of managing the nuclear waste and the possible risk of disasters at nuclear plants have made many countries wary of nuclear power, especially when green activists are forcefully advocating a turn away from it.
The world's nuclear quandary is best expressed by
Germany
, which needs to transition from coal and gas to clean energy but might not meet its goals without nuclear power.
Live Events
Yet, in April, Germany shut off its last nuclear reactors, ending a six-decade programme that spawned one of Europe's strongest protest movements but saw a brief reprieve due to the Ukraine war, Reuters reported. A former lawmaker called it the biggest economic stupidity by the party, saying the decision was also intended to sway a state election where the issue was playing into the hands of the Greens. Germany had made up its mind to quit nuclear power after Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster caused leakage of radiation, triggering panic across the world.
Nuclear power made up just 6% of Germany's energy production last year, compared to 44% from renewables. But two thirds of Germans favoured extending the lifespan of reactors or connecting old plants back to the grid, with only 28% backing the phase-out, a survey in April showed.
Nuclear power proponents say Germany will have to go back to nuclear eventually if it wants to phase out fossil fuels and reach its goal of becoming greenhouse gas-neutral across all sectors by 2045 as wind and solar energy will not fully cover demand. ""By phasing out nuclear power, Germany is committing itself to coal and gas because there is not always enough wind blowing or sun shining,"" said Rainer Klute, head of pro-nuclear non-profit association Nuklearia.
Is the world being swayed by emotions like Arjuna and turning back on its duty to move from fossil fuels to clean energy when wind and solar options are too slow to provide a solution?
Nuclear energy business has gone down
The share of nuclear power in global gross electricity generation fell below 10% in 2021 to the lowest in around four decades. Nuclear energy generated 2,653 terawatt hours of electricity, accounting for 9.8% of global generation - the lowest since the 1980s, the World Nuclear Industry Status Report showed.
As of mid-2022, 411 reactors were operating in 33 countries, four less than a year earlier and 27 below a 2002 peak of 438. The most nuclear power in the world is generated in the United States, followed by China.
The slow pace of new projects coming on stream has meant the average age of reactors is around 31 years old. Out of 53 reactors under construction currently, at least half of the projects are delayed. Five new units became operational in the first half of this year, while eight closed last year.
Global investment in new nuclear construction projects in 2021 was around $24 billion, accounting for 6.5% of total investment of $366 billion in non-hydro renewables projects, showed the report.
The dawn of a new nuclear era?
Despite strong opposition from green activists, many countries are warming up to nuclear energy for lower costs and quicker transition from fossil fuels.
Renewable sources are expected to dominate the growth of the global electricity supply over the next three years but only with nuclear power they would meet the vast majority of the increase in global demand, an International Energy Agency (IEA) report said.
In the US, several American startups are working on building a new generation of small reactors that could push nuclear energy into a new phase, with support from the US government, AFP reported. Currently, 93 remaining legacy reactors -- which provide around 18 percent of the country's electricity -- are ageing fast; six reactors have already been decommissioned since 2017. The future of the industry will likely rely on small modular reactors -- or SMRs -- similar to the ones currently powering submarines.
SMRs have been promoted as a cheaper option than legacy reactors, with shortened construction time and less fuel needed to power them, which translates into less nuclear waste. SMR players say their reactors are safer than traditional ones, with some claiming the new technology is not prone to serious incidents leading to irradiation and contamination, shielding them from a core meltdown like the one that occurred in Fukushima in 2011.
In Europe, the search for alternative sources to Russian energy during the war in Ukraine has refocused attention on smaller, easier-to-build nuclear power stations, the SMRs. UK-based Rolls-Royce SMR says its SMRs are much cheaper and quicker to get running than standard plants, delivering the kind of energy security that many nations are seeking.
The estimated cost of a Rolls-Royce SMR is 2.2 billion to 2.8 billion pounds (USD 2.5 billion to USD 3.2 billion), with an estimated construction time of 5 1/2 years, AP reported. That's two years faster than it took to build a standard nuclear plant between 2016 and 2021, according to International Atomic Energy Agency statistics. Some estimates put the cost of building a 1,100-megawatt nuclear plant at between USD 6 billion and USD 9 billion.
Even Saudi Arabia is planning to shift from oil to nuclear energy, given its rich store of uranium which it wants to exploit for exports too.
In India, nuclear power currently comprises three per cent of total electricity generation. The government thinks sufficient production and share of atomic energy is essential for ensuring the country's energy security. Current policy targets a three-fold rise in nuclear installed capacity by 2032.
The current installed nuclear power capacity is set to increase from 6,780 MW to 22,480 MW by 2032 on progressive completion of projects under construction and accorded sanction. Reuters reported in May that India was considering overturning a ban on foreign investment in its nuclear power industry and allowing greater participation by domestic private firms, as part of a push for cleaner energy.
With the proponents and opponents of nuclear energy sharply ranged against each other and a global consensus remaining elusive, the world finds itself much like Arjuna in the no-man's land between the two opposing armies, the space where he eventually gets his spiritual lesson and shuns his quandary. WIll the world, in its pressing moment of climate crisis, build its resolve?

India achieved its target of producing energy through non-fossil fuel sources ahead of schedule: R K Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-achieved-its-target-of-producing-energy-through-non-fossil-fuel-sources-ahead-of-schedule-singh/articleshow/102014809.cms,21-07-2023,"Union minister
R K
Singh on Friday said that
India
has achieved its target of producing 43.6 per cent of its total energy through non-fossil fuel sources nine years ahead of the schedule.
The Minister of Power and New and Renewable Energy was addressing the opening session of the G20 14th Clean Energy Ministerial meeting and 8th Mission Innovation meeting in
Goa.
""India has already achieved the target of producing 43.6 per cent of its total energy through non-fossil fuel sources. The country has achieved nine years ahead of its schedule of 2030,"" he said.
India's installed electricity capacity through non-fossil fuel sources is 183 gigawatts (GW), out of the total capacity of 421 GW. ""We have 88 GW under installation and 55 GW tendered out. If you take the capacity which is installed and under installation, that comes to about 270 GW, which is well above 50 per cent of our service capacity,"" he said.
Singh said that India will add 50 GW every year. The minister said that the world has already surpassed the challenge of climate change sceptics. ""Those who said that there is nothing called global warming and it is all myth propagated by developed countries. Now, nobody says that because the effect of climate change is there for all of us to see,"" he said.
""We see the raging wildfires, increase in temperatures. Nobody has any doubt that climate change is real,"" he added.

Singh pointed out that India has the lowest per capita carbon emission in the world. ""Our emission is 2.29 tonnes per capita per year. The global average is about 6.3 tonnes. The reason for that, partly, is the cultural factor,"" the minister said.
Singh said that India venerates simplicity. ""Our simple lifestyles are looked up to.
Mahatma Gandhi
adopted a dress which actually this country venerates, that is simplicity,"" he said. ""I am in politics. I can tell you that if I am showy, flashy, I will lose votes. Simplicity gains votes. Straightforwardness gets me votes,"" he said.
The minister said that India is ""very bullish and firm"" on issues pertaining to the environment. ""Our environmental laws are strict. If you plant a tree on your own land, you can't cut it without permission,"" he added.
Talking about the Union government's programmes, he said, ""We have a programme for the industry that has resulted in emission reduction of 105 million tonnes of Carbon dioxide. We have
Ujala
programme reduction in 100 MT per annum of CO2.""
""The star-rated appliances programne has resulted in emission reduction of 57 MT per annum...There is total emission reduction of 278 MT per tonnes that is besides the renewable,"" he said.
The minister praised Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
over the measures taken by his government for environment protection.

to prepare a regulatory framework that would address key challenges including pricing, the industry official said. EDF is expected to complete the report by the end of this year, the official added.

While cross-border grid linkages have drawn investment and government interest in regions from Europe to Southeast Asia, the rising cost of building subsea cables, surging prices of raw materials needed to upgrade grids and geopolitical tensions have raised questions about the viability of such projects.
Members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) have been trying for decades to form a regional grid to facilitate multilateral power trade, but progress has been limited to bilateral deals between countries.
India plans to boost its renewable and big hydropower capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, from 177 GW currently. Solar parks are expected to account for much of the new capacity.
The effort could help ease fossil fuel dependence by making solar power available for more hours of the day, the ministry officials said.

Transmission charges on power supplied using an interconnected regional network is a key challenge, the second of the ministry officials said.
Interconnections would be both under the sea and on land, with integration of renewable energy boosted by pooling resources from across the region, the same official added.
India already exports some power to Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan along with very small amounts to Myanmar that would be stepped up massively under the new plan.

On 6 April, the first unit of 800 MW capacity of the Godda plant, in India’s Jharkhand state, began commercial operations. The second unit, also of 800 MW capacity, followed on 26 June. APJL will supply 1,496 MW from the Godda USCTPP under the PPA with the Bangladesh Power Development Board, executed in November 2017 for a period of 25 years, via a 400 kV dedicated transmission system connected to the Bangladesh grid.
Adani Group said the USCTPP’s commissioning in a record time of just 42 months after achieving financial closure and obtaining the necessary clearances is particularly noteworthy given the considerable logistical challenges the project faced, including the establishment of a 105 km-long 400 kV Double Circuit Transmission Line, the construction of a private railway line, and the implementation of an extensive water pipeline from the Ganges.
""Electricity supplied from Godda will have a positive impact on Bangladesh’s power situation by replacing costly power generated by using liquid fuel,"" Adani Group said, adding that this transition will help Bangladesh reduce the average cost of power purchased.
The Godda power plant is the first in India to have started operations with 100% flue gas desulphurization (FGD), selective catalytic re-converter (SCR) and zero water discharge for minimizing emissions and for environment friendly operations in alignment with the norms set by the
Ministry of Environment
, Forests, and Climate Change of the Government of India, the Group added.

The Godda power plant will also be first in India to have started operations with 100% flue gas desulphurization (FGD), selective catalytic reconverter (SCR) and zero water discharge for minimizing emissions and for environment friendly operations in alignment with the norms set by the
Ministry of Environment

She further added, WCC was appointed only in December 2022, and our first Limited Review Report on the standalone and consolidated financial results for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2023 was qualified on account of material overstatement of revenues from contracts with customers and material overstatement of profit before tax, as reported in our review reports dated February 10, 2023.
""In our view, the proposed removal of auditors by the board of directors is purely an action to camouflage undue delays in providing sufficient and appropriate audit evidence, to seek clarification on the critical assessment of the information provided so far, and to prevent us from performing our audit procedures. There are several critical matters that remain unresolved that have been highlighted to management from time to time and to the audit committee on July 5, 2023,"" she said. ""Protecting public and stakeholder interest is at the centre of the WCC philosophy as an auditor, and we will take whatever steps necessary to provide that assurance.""
Experts contend that the dispute between the auditor and the company may become complicated because Sebi does not permit an auditor to resign without first performing a year-end audit, and the Companies Act prohibits a company from removing an auditor without central government approval, raising doubts about the resolution's validity.
In February 2023, auditor Walker Chandiok & Co LLP expressed significant concerns regarding the internal financial controls of the company. Their report highlighted the existence of ""material weaknesses"" within the company's financial control systems, and raised doubts about the accuracy and completeness of its financial statements.
Shares in EKI closed 1.41% down at Rs 462 apiece on the BSE on Friday. Their 52-week high was Rs 2,315.

Relief to 7.5 lakh Mumbaikars on lower outgo on electricity billing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/tata-powers-7-5-lakh-mumbai-customers-to-pay-lower-old-tariff-after-apltel-order/articleshow/101750170.cms,14-07-2023,"The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) has stayed Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission’s multi-year tariff schedule for
Tata Power
for 2023-24. Tata Power's interim application to set aside a tariff schedule has been accepted by APTEL.
""The consumers of Tata Power will benefit from this order. It also vindicates the stand of Tata Power that it can offer cheaper electricity to Mumbaikars. Customers of Tata Power in
Mumbai
will get the benefit of this order as the Company will be able to pass on the relief to its 7.5 lakh consumers,"" the company said in a statement.
“This interim stay is a testament to Tata Power's dedication to delivering affordable electricity to the people of Mumbai. It validates our commitment to providing sustainable power at cheaper rates, and our customers will directly reap the benefits of this decision,"" said Sanjay Banga, President, Transmission and Distribution, Tata Power.
In the interim period, the tariff proposed by the company to the
MERC
on March 31, 2020, becomes applicable once again. This tariff is 25-35% lower than the existing one and will be for the benefit of the consumers, the company said.
Tata Power had approached the APTEL this May seeking a stay on the multi-year tariff for 2023-24 and 2024-25 as the tariffs calculated by MERC were higher than should be. For Tata Power, this move may also stem migration of customers to other service providers.

""As a result of all this the power availability in rural areas has gone up from 12:30 hrs in 2014 to 22:30 hrs today; while in urban areas the national average availability is 23:30 hrs. Minister stated that together we have made the power sector viable. Today all current power purchase dues are paid on time, while the legacy overdues have come down from Rs 1,39,747 cr to Rs 69,957 cr.""
Meanwhile, the central government has made changes to the prevailing power tariff system through an amendment in the existing rules, introducing a 'Time of Day'-based power tariff mechanism.
Rather than being charged for electricity at the same rate at all times of the day, the price you pay for electricity will vary according to the time of day after amendments are made to the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020.
Under the proposed Time of Day-based system, the tariff during solar hours -- eight hours of a day shall be 10-20 per cent less than the normal tariff, while the tariff during 'peak hours' will be 10-20 per cent higher.
This proposed tariff would apply for commercial and industrial consumers with a maximum demand of 10 KW and above from April 1, 2024, and for all other consumers except agricultural consumers, from April 1, 2025.
""Time of Day tariff shall be made effective immediately after installation of smart meters, for the consumers with smart meters,"" the
Union Ministry of Power
said on Friday in a release in June.
Union Power Minister RK Singh had then said the time-based tariff system was a win-win for consumers as well as the power industry.
The time-based tariff system is recognised globally across electricity industries as a means to shift a portion of their power loads from peak times to off-peak times, thereby improving the overall load factor.

Chinese-backed power plant in Myanmar shuts down operation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/chinese-backed-power-plant-in-myanmar-shuts-down-operation/articleshow/101681564.cms,12-07-2023,"A Chinese-backed combined cycle
power plant
near
Gantgawdaw Pagoda
in
Myanmar
’s Arakan State’s
Kyaukphyu
Township has shut down operations.
“The power plant has shut down its operations,” said U Phoe San, a former Arakan State parliamentarian from Kyaukphyu Township. China is building port at Kyaukphyu.
The combined cycle power plant started operating earlier this year, and the heat sensor system used in the waste heat system was not working properly, so the system was completely stopped, people close to the plant said.
“It is known that the thermal sensor system goes up and down to reuse the experimental heat energy. I think it’s a low level of technology. Electricity generated by this power plant is exported directly to mainland Myanmar, so there is no impact on the local residents,” said a resident of Kyaukphyu.
The power plant will use 22 million cubic feet of gas per day from the Shwe natural gas project to produce 1 billion kWh per year. When the power plant operates, it will generate 135 MW of electricity at a rate of 8.59 cents per unit. It is intended to produce about 1,000 million kilowatt hours of power per year.

“As the thermal sensor system is not working, this plant cannot produce the 135 megawatts of electricity it is supposed to produce. If the megawatt is not enough, there will be difficulties in the processes that the junta will do,” said U Tun Lwin, a resident of Kyaukphyu and an observer of Chinese and Korean projects.
The
Myanmar Investment Commission
granted permission to Power China Resources Co., Ltd to build the power project in January 2020, and the plant is expected to be fully operational later this year.
The plant will supply residential, industrial and commercial areas in Arakan State, and is a key power plant for the socioeconomic development of local people in the state, said the regime’s deputy minister for electric power, Dr.
Aung Zeya
during a trial run of the power plant in October last year.
There are 374 villages in Kyaukphyu Township, and some 100 villages still do not have access to grid electricity, according to locals.

power ministry
has proposed a scheme with an initial outlay of around ₹16,000 crore to financially support new
hydropower projects
, people in the know said. The financial support will envisage enabling infrastructure and grant for the north-eastern states to pick stakes in such projects, they said.
The scheme will be part of the broader
hydropower policy
that has already been sent to the Cabinet for approval last month, one of the people said.
Enabling infrastructure around hydropower projects will get a budgetary support of around ₹12,000 crore. While the enabling infrastructure for such projects currently includes roads and bridges, transmission lines from the power station to the pooling stations too could be added to it as per the proposal. Pumped hydropower storage projects may also get the financial benefits.
North-eastern states that wish to have a joint venture for such projects are likely to be given financial assistance for their stake and the total funds proposed to be earmarked for such support is ₹4,000 crore, the person said.

Uttar Pradesh
government on Tuesday approved two 'Obra D' thermal power projects of 800 MW each to be built at the cost of Rs 18,000 crore in Sonbhadra's Obra, a move aimed at providing cheaper electricity to the people of state. The 'Obra D' thermal power plants were approved in the Cabinet meeting presided by Chief Minister
Yogi Adityanah
, an official statement issued here said.
The projects will be executed by the government with a 50:50 partnership with central government-owned power generator
NTPC

The energy minister also said that UP's current capacity in terms of thermal power generation stands at 7,000 MW and the two plants will contribute almost 25 per cent of the existing capacity.
""We hope that this plant becomes an energy hub not only of the state, but of the entire country. The consumption of coal will be lower at the new plants because of use of advanced technologies while transportation cost of the coal will also drop significantly due to the close location of
NCL
coal mines,"" he said.
""At present, we buy electricity at Rs 5.50 per unit, while from this plant we will be able to buy electricity at Rs.4.79 per unit. That is, we will be able to provide cheap electricity to consumers at Re 1 per unit,"" he added.

It also aims at better power portfolio management of MeECL through a team of professionals thus building upon the strength and expertise of the NTPC in this field. It will also lead to judicious utilization of own power resources of MeECL as well as better mix and use of renewable and green energy available in the country.

Jaypee Group
's flagship firm
Jaiprakash Associates
has defaulted on loans worth Rs 4,044 crore, including principal and interest amount. In a regulatory filing on Friday,
Jaiprakash Associates Ltd
(JAL) informed that the company on June 30th defaulted on repayments of a principal amount of Rs 1,660 crore and interest of Rs 2,384 crore.
The loans pertained to various banks, and the nature of the obligation is fund-based working capital, non-fund-based working capital, term loans and FCCB (foreign currency convertible bonds).
""The total borrowing (including interest) of the company is Rs 29,477 crore, repayable by 2037, against which only Rs 4,044 crore is overdue as on June 30, 2023,"" JAL said.
Out of the total borrowing of Rs 29,477 crore, the company said that Rs 18,319 crore will get further reduced on transfer to the proposed
Special Purpose Vehicle
(SPV) for which the scheme of arrangement, duly approved by all the stakeholders, is pending sanction of National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
).
""The entire loan is in any case under restructuring,"" it added.
Live Events
The company said it has been taking tangible steps to reduce the borrowings.
""Post the proposed divestment of cement business and the restructuring under consideration, the borrowing will get almost to nil upon implementation of revised restructuring plan,"" it said.
JAL also said that
ICICI Bank
had approached the NCLT Allahabad on the direction of the RBI under section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 against the company. It has contested the move.
""The matter is pending to be decided simultaneously with the Scheme of Arrangement for transfer of real estate to the SPV to be sanctioned by the NCLT,"" the filing said.
In September 2018,
ICICI Bank
filed an insolvency petition against JAL. The country's biggest lender
SBI
has also moved the NCLT against JAL, claiming a total default of Rs 6,893.15 crore as of September 15, 2022.
Recently, JAL and its group firms announced the sale of its remaining cement assets to Dalmia Bharat Ltd at an enterprise value of Rs 5,666 crore and exit from the sector as part of its strategy to reduce debt.
Earlier, as part of its debt resolution exercise, JAL had sold more than 20 million tonnes per annum cement capacity to Aditya Birla group firm
UltraTech Cement
between 2014 and 2017.
In its erstwhile subsidiary Jaypee
Infratech Ltd
(JIL), Mumbai-based realty firm Suraksha Group had in March got approval from the NCLT for its bid to acquire JIL and complete around 20,000 apartments in Noida.
However, many parties have approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against the NCLT order.

The power demand in certain

GIC makes big energy bet with $2 billion smart meters platform with Genus Power,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/gic-makes-big-energy-bet-with-2-billion-smart-meters-platform-with-genus-power/articleshow/101486503.cms,05-07-2023,"Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund
GIC
is setting up a $2 billion platform with listed smart meters manufacturer
Genus Power Infrastructures Ltd
, which will make it the biggest such platform in the smart meters space in India.
GIC will also be investing$63 million or Rs519 crore into
Genus Power
through warrants.
Genus Power, founded in 1995, is amongst the largest players in India’s electricity metering solutions industry, with approximately 27% market share. The company has manufacturing plants across Jaipur, Haridwar and Guwahati with a total installed capacity of over 10 million meters.
The platform will bid for
smart meter
concessions in India, which is an approximately $30 billion market.
GIC will hold a majority stake of 74% and controlling rights in the platform, while Genus will hold the remaining 26%. The platform will have an exclusive supply contract for smart meters with Genus. The platform will be based out of Singapore.
Live Events
“This is the first time in India that a sovereign wealth fund like GIC is setting up a platform where it will be a controlling shareholder right from the start. Generally sovereign and pension funds tend to invest in minority positions in most platforms,” a source said.
“This is GIC’s second major bet in the Indian energy space after renewables,” he added.
The deal between GIC and Genus comes at a time when the smart meter sector is seeing a lot of tailwinds with government push and policy support.
“The Indian government has set a target of 250 million smart meters by 2026. The pace of rollout of the same has however been slow and thus there is a push from the government to speed up the program and more and more state utilities are expected to come up with smart meter concessions in the coming quarters,” the source said.
While the financial health of state utilities in India has remained a major concern, the government has derisked the smart meter business model with the ‘direct debit’ system, wherein the smart meter operator gets paid first when a consumer pays their bill, thereby eliminating risk of payment dues from the utility, the source said.
Genus was advised by Impact Infracap and Beyond Advisory, while Talwar Thakore & Associates acted as the legal advisor. Resolüt Partners acted as legal advisors to GIC.

He expected the growth momentum to strengthen in the remaining period and hoped for around 20 per cent growth for the full fiscal.
PTC India's consolidated total income stood at Rs 16,002.51 crore last fiscal as against Rs 16,879.77 crore in the year-ago period, while net profit was Rs 507.15 crore during 2022-23 as compared with Rs 551.67 crore a year ago.
In the last fiscal on the operational front, the power trading volumes stood at 70,610 million units as against 87,515 million units in the year-ago period.
The trading volumes were down by 19 per cent in the last fiscal on account of a decline in low-margin power exchange-traded volumes, he said.
Mishra attributed the fall in volumes to the company's strategy to consolidate and protect profit margins, instead of going after higher volumes.
""FY23 for PTC
India
was a year of consolidation by taking strategic calls, ceding volumes to avoid negative impact on the cost of funds and reorienting the business model. Throughout the year, our company prioritised core margins over volumes as a part of the business strategy,"" he said.
Mishra noted that the company's consultancy business is acquiring complex assignments like distribution management, project management for a renewable energy hub, assistance in creating a green hydrogen hub and advisory for a battery energy storage system.
""The company's sponsored power exchange platform Hindustan Power Exchange has traded more than 5 billion units and onboarded more than 550 clients within 12 months of operations,"" he said.
PTC India CMD
said the company is launching multiple initiatives in trading renewable energy with fresh business models and is deepening its relationship in cross-border trades with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
Mishra also stressed that all the necessary steps have been taken to ensure corporate governance and best ethical practices.
PTC India and its group companies have published unqualified annual accounts after four quarters. All three companies have shown profitability.
Promoter companies (
Powergrid
,
NTPC
, PFC and
NHPC
) hold a 16 per cent stake in PTC India, while 84 per cent shareholding is with financial institutions, large utilities, and the public.
PTC India has two subsidiaries --
PTC Energy Ltd
and
PTC Financial Services Ltd

According to NSE bulk deals data, Fortitude Trade and Investment, a promoter of Adani Transmission, sold 33.9 million shares, or a 3.04% stake, in the company for ₹2,666.47 crore at ₹786.19 apiece.
While NSE data showed that GQG Partners bought 21.3 million of these shares for ₹1,676 crore, sources said the entire lot was purchased by the US fund.
On Wednesday, GQG invested in

Energy after promoter entities sold stakes in the two companies via bulk deals to raise ₹8,372 crore. The US-based fund increased its stake from 3.39% to 4.96% in Adani Enterprises, and from 3.5% to 6.32% in Adani Green, sources told ET.
GQG had first invested ₹15,446 crore in four Adani Group companies on March 2, taking a contrarian bet on the ports-to-cooking oil conglomerate when its shares had taken a beating following a report by a US-based short-seller that accused the group of illegal stock price manipulation.

The Adani Group has denied all allegations.
In subsequent weeks, the fund increased its stake in the Adani Group by around 10% by buying shares in the open market, Rajiv Jain, founder and chief investment officer of GQG Partners, told media.
In a call with investors in March in Australia, where GQG is listed, Jain had indicated the fund's keenness to increase investment in the billionaire Gautam Adani-led conglomerate.
""Chances are, we'll probably buy more because we typically initiate a position and then depending on how things go and how the earnings come through, we tend to get it to full size because we're not at full size at this point,"" Jain had told reporters a week after buying into the Adani Group in March.
The conglomerate's stocks have been on a recovery path from their lows since GQG's investment.

The company is yet to generate liquidity in the day-ahead segments. In the term-ahead market, HPX had a 35% market share in April. India has three power exchanges - India Energy Exchange,
Hindustan Power Exchange and Power Exchange India
.
IEX commands almost the entire market share in the spot power market. ""As soon as market coupling comes into place, probably we will take 2-3 months [for achieving the desired market share],"" Singh told ET.
The power ministry had requested the
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
earlier this month to initiate a market coupling process of multiple electricity exchanges, which could make prices uniform across the sector's bourses.
In this form of discovering prices, bids are accepted in all power exchanges, brought together to a market coupling operator that merges them and runs a single combined solution.

World Economic Forum
on Wednesday ranked
India
at the 67th place globally on its
Energy Transition Index
and said it is the only major economy with energy transition momentum accelerating across all dimensions. Sweden topped the list and was followed by Denmark, Norway, Finland and Switzerland in the top five on the list of 120 countries.
Releasing the report published in collaboration with Accenture, the
WEF
said the global energy transition has plateaued amid the global energy crisis and geopolitical volatilities, but India is among the countries that have made significant improvements.
""India is the only major economy with energy transition momentum accelerating across the Energy Transition Index's equitable, secure and sustainable dimensions,"" the WEF said.
""For example, despite continued economic growth, India has successfully reduced the energy intensity of its economy and the carbon intensity of its energy mix, while achieving universal energy access and effectively managing affordability of electricity,"" the WEF added.
Achieving universal access to electricity, replacing solid fuels with clean cooking options and increasing
renewable energy
deployment have been primary contributors to the improvement of India's performance.

India also emerged relatively less affected from the recent energy crisis, largely due to the low share of natural gas in power generation and increased use of existing generation capacities.
""Although the country maintains a well-diversified mix of energy trade partners, rising import dependence represents a risk amid global energy market volatilities,"" the WEF said.
The energy mix, however, remains predominantly carbon intensive, with a low share of clean energy in final demand.
""Improvements in the enabling environment have been driven by political commitment, an ambitious reform agenda, infrastructure investments and a competitive renewable energy landscape,"" the WEF said.

""Continued progress will be challenged by two key macro trends: strong economic growth, and the urgency to create quality jobs for a growing working age population.
""A skilled workforce, public-private collaboration in innovation, and investment in research and development in low-carbon technologies are necessary to enable India's energy transition,"" it added.

along with promoting a sustained increase in paid electricity consumption, the ministry said that the financial incentives will further allow additional borrowings.
""Under this initiative, an additional borrowing space of up to 0.5 percent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is available to the States annually for a four-year period from 2021-22 to 2024-25. This additional financial window is dependent on implementation of specific reforms in the power sector by the States,"" it added.
The ministry also made provisions for states that could not complete the reform process in 2021-22 and 2022-23 by availing the grant allocated for the year 2023-24.
With an amount of Rs 15,263 crore, West Bengal received the highest amount of additional borrowing permission for 2021-22 and 2022-23. It was followed by Rajasthan which received Rs 11,308 crore. However, Manipur and Mizoram were among the states which bagged the least share of additional borrowing with Rs 180 crore and Rs 192 crore respectively.

Bangladesh will soon import power from Nepal via India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/bangladesh-will-soon-import-power-from-nepal-via-india/articleshow/101318399.cms,27-06-2023,"New Delhi: A tripartite power trade agreement enabling
Bangladesh
to import electricity from
Nepal
through
India
's grid is expected to be signed in July, reshaping sub-regional cooperation that has been boosted in recent times through cross-border transport and energy initiatives.
During Nepal PM
Pushpa Kamal
Dahal's visit here early June, he and Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
unveiled plans for India to facilitate the export of hydropower from Nepal to Bangladesh. To begin with, Bangladesh will import 40-50 MW electricity from Nepal and this will be Kathmandu's maiden power export venture outside India.
The deal is expected to be signed next month, ET has learnt. The agreement will also meet a long-standing demand from Nepal and Bangladesh to allow the trading of power through the Indian grid. Experts claim this will reduce dependence of India's neighbours on
China
in the long run.
The move fits in with efforts by India in recent years to forge greater energy connectivity with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka through electricity transmission networks and
petroleum
pipelines.
In the past, electricity trade with neighbours was done under bilateral agreements. The finalisation of new guidelines for Cross-Border Trade of Electricity in recent years served as building blocks for the new arrangements. The guidelines evolved after consultations with all stakeholders, allowing neighbouring countries to purchase and sell power through the Indian grid and participate in Indian power exchanges, according to people aware of the matter.
Live Events
The guidelines were drafted in such a way that power from any Chinese-funded power plant in a neighbouring country cannot be traded through the Indian grid, according to one of persons familiar with the matter.
A long-term Power Trade Agreement was signed between India and Nepal during Prachanda's trip to New Delhi. Under this Agreement, India has set a target of 10,000 MW of electricity from Nepal in the coming years.

""Our whole objective is to reduce dependence on imported sources of energy. The way to do this is two-fold to electrify the economy and then to green the energy,"" he said.
BEE Director General (DG) Abhay Bhakre said that impact of various government schemes, including incentives and subsidies, would be assessed, sub-sectoral energy consumption patterns will be analysed, and data on non-commercial energy sources like biomass would be captured.
BEE, under the Ministry of Power, promotes the use of energy-efficient processes, equipment, devices and systems. It takes various steps to encourage preferential treatment for the use of energy-efficient equipment or appliances.

Consumers can now save upto 20% in electricity bills with the new tariff rule,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-to-cut-power-tariff-during-solar-hours-raise-for-peak-hours/articleshow/101209500.cms,23-06-2023,"Electricity consumers across the country will now be able to save up to 20 per cent in electricity bills by planning their power consumption thanks to government’s ‘time of the day’ tariff.
ToD offers varied rates depending on the time of day, allowing consumers to avoid using electricity for things like cooking and doing laundry at peak hours when power prices are higher.
People will now be able to schedule their chores like washing or cooking during off-peak hours (daytime or solar hours) when tariff is lower.
Under the new tariff system, a
power ministry
statement said, the rate of electricity during solar hours (eight hours in a day as specified by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission) shall be 10 per cent to 20 per cent less than the normal charges, while it will be 10 to 20 per cent higher during peak hours.
Beginning April 1, 2024, the ToD rate will be in effect for commercial and industrial customers with demand of at least 10 KW. With the exception of agricultural consumers, the new rule will take effect on April 1, 2025 for all other categories of consumers.
Live Events
For people who already have smart metres, ToD tariff come into force as soon as these metres are installed.
Rather than being charged for electricity at the same rate throughout the day, the price a user pays for electricity will vary according to the time of day, the ministry said.
Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said since
solar power
is cheaper, the tariff during solar hours will be less.
He termed ToD tariff a win-win situation for consumers as well as the electricity providers.
""The ToD tariffs comprising separate tariffs for peak hours, solar hours and normal hours, send price signals to consumers to manage their load according to the tariff. With awareness and effective utilisation of ToD tariff mechanism, consumers can reduce their electricity bills,"" Singh said in the statement.
During non-solar hours thermal and hydropower as well as gas-based capacity is used. Their costs are higher than that of solar power and this will be reflected in ToD Tariff.
He said the new mechanism will also ensure better grid integration of renewable energy sources thereby facilitating faster energy transition for
India
.
Majority of the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) have already introduced ToD tariffs for large commercial and industrial categories of consumers.
With the installation of smart meters, ToD tariff metering at the domestic consumer level will be introduced as per the tariff policy mandate.
The ministry said that the government has also simplified the rules for smart metering.
To avoid inconvenience/harassment of the consumers, the existing penalties for increase in consumer's demand beyond the maximum sanctioned load/demand have been reduced, it said.
No penalty will be imposed on consumers based on maximum demand recorded by the smart meter for the period before installation date, it added.
Additionally, the process for load revision has been streamlined in such a way that the maximum demand will only be increased if the sanctioned load exceeds at least three times in a fiscal year.
Smart meters shall be read remotely at least once in a day and the data shall be shared with consumers in order to enable them to take informed decision about consumption of electricity, the ministry statement said.
The Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020 was notified by the government on December 31, 2020, based on the conviction that
power systems
is meant to serve consumers and that consumers have rights to get reliable and quality services.

Coal India chief says fuel price could be linked to inflation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/coal-india-chief-says-fuel-price-could-be-linked-to-inflation/articleshow/101200076.cms,23-06-2023,"Coal India Ltd
may devise a mechanism where a hike in coal prices in the future could be linked to inflation or some other parameters to avoid sudden increases, its chairman and MD
Pramod Agrawal
told ET.
""We are devising a mechanism through which sudden increase etc. will be done away with and will be linked with parameters so that smooth price increase can happen in future,"" he said, adding that when this will happen has not been worked out yet.
Prices of domestic coal used for generating power have not been revised in the past five years. An increase in the fuel price directly impacts the power cost and is usually passed on to consumers.
For a price increase for the power sector, all stakeholders must come on board, he said.
""We will take a balanced approach taking stakeholders on board as an increase in
coal price
will have a cascading effect on various commodities. The aim is to protect our EBITDA and shield the nation from the impact,"" he said.

Last month, the state-owned company increased prices of higher grades of coal used mainly in industries like cement, fertilizer, and sponge iron. Coal prices for the power sector, where 78% of its production is sold, were untouched.
Coal price for the power sector is about 17% lower than what the other sectors are offered.
But volume sales also help in profit maximisation, Agrawal said, adding that since the company's fixed cost is high, any production increase has a good leverage for its bottom-line.
The company plans to produce 780 mt in ongoing fiscal, higher than FY23 production of 703 mt, which will bring output cost per tonne down, Agrawal said.
India's largest coal miner is looking to diversify its business in solar power generation and coal-to-chemical projects.
The company may foray into critical mineral assets overseas like lithium, cobalt, and nickel where India is 100% import dependent, Agarwal said. For this, the company is planning large-scale skilling of its employees.
However, the company will not face any short- or medium-term vulnerability, Agrawal said.

Energy shortage is virtually nil now,” Singh said, while highlighting the achievements of the ministry in the last nine years.
The aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses for financial year 2022-23 are likely to fall to around 13.5% from 16.4% in FY22 as per initial indications, power secretary Alok Kumar said.
This will be the third consecutive financial year when
India
’s AT&C losses, which have been an issue for decades, will see a decline. In FY21, the loss was 22.3%.
The fall is the result of measures like the revised prudential norms for lending, revamped distribution sector scheme, mandatory energy accounting and auditing, late payment surcharge, among others. “Against legacy dues of Rs 1,39,747 crore as on June 3, 2022, 13 states have paid instalments of `64,196 crore,” the minister said.
The total installed power generation capacity currently is 416 GW, Singh said, adding that the maximum demand till date has only been 221 GW. The installed capacity is now close to double the peak demand and India is exporting power to neighbouring countries, Singh said. The country exported 2.4 billion units in FY23.

Around 27 GW of thermal power plants are under construction and another 24 GW are in the pre-construction stage. In renewable energy, almost 120 GW capacity is in the bidding stage or under active construction point. India is the fastest growing nation in the renewable energy space apart from China, the minister said.
India’s energy shortage came down to 0.2% so far in FY24 from 4.2% in FY14, Singh said. Carbon trading design and architecture are almost finalised and could be published in the next two weeks, Kumar said. The country’s solar module manufacturing capacity installed and in the pipeline is 25 GW but expected to go up to 100 GW in 2030. Solar cells manufacturing capacity is also expected at 55 GW in the same timeline.

The terms of reference say that SBI Caps, while executing the process, will ensure compliance with the
RBI
guidelines of June 8, 2023, for the sale of VIPL debt and OTS.
The appointment of SBI Caps comes at a time when VIPL lenders have received three suo moto bids for the sale and OTS of VIPL debt.
Reliance Power, the promoter of VIPL, has made an OTS offer to the lenders of VIPL.
Reliance Power's all-cash offer of Rs 1,260 crore is supported by the
Varde Partners
of
Singapore
.
Ahmedabad-based CFM Asset Reconstruction and NARCL are the other two bidders in the fray.
But, CFM ARC's Rs 1,220 crore all-cash offer is lower than RPower's offer of Rs 1,260 crore.
The third bidder, NARCL's offer of Rs 1,120 crore is significantly lower than RPower's OTS offer, as it is offering only 15 per cent in cash, while the rest will be paid over 5 years. The Net Present Value (NPV) of NARCL's offer is only Rs 850 crore.

Reliance Power and CFM ARC have proposed to lenders that their offer should be considered as an anchor offer for the Swiss challenge auction. The anchor bidder has a strategic advantage at a Swiss challenge auction since it has the first right to match any counteroffer that lenders receive at the auction.
""To maximise recovery, the highest bidder is always selected as anchor bidder,"" one of the lenders. ""In this case, the promoter's offer will most likely be an anchor offer,"" he added.
State Bank of India
,
Axis Bank
,
Bank of Baroda
,
Punjab National Bank
,
Canara Bank
and
Bank of Maharashtra
are among the lenders of
Vidarbha Industries
Power. They appointed
SBI
CAPS as a process advisor to sell their debt.
Lenders have an exposure of ₹2,987 crore to the power company, according to a National Company Law Tribunal order dated January 29, 2021.
Last July, the Supreme Court dismissed Axis Bank's petition to admit Vidarbha Industries for insolvency, stating that the tribunal, which approved admitting the company, should have considered external factors that had led to the delay in payments by the borrower.

RK Singh
on Tuesday said that with India's power demand expected to grow in coming years, the priority is to make sure there is sufficient electricity for development.
""Our energy transition will be the fastest in the world, but we will not compromise on availability for our development needs,"" Singh said at the
ET Energy Leadership Summit
.
The country is on track to meet its target of 500 GW installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, Singh said, adding that India could even cross that target. India has been able to add renewable energy capacity at the fastest pace in the world and has emerged as the most attractive investment destination for it, he said.
The country is also making inroads in
green hydrogen
with the
National Green Hydrogen Mission
.
Green hydrogen needs to succeed for the world to move toward cleaner feedstock, and a 'low carbon' version of the fuel will not be sufficient, Singh said.

Major economies are deliberating on a green hydrogen standard, which is also a focus at the G20 Energy Transition Working Group meetings under India's presidency, with a few suggesting 'low carbon' hydrogen production instead of just 'green'.
The minister said some countries are taking a protectionist approach toward producing green hydrogen by providing subsidies.
Singh emphasised the need for global energy security and supply chain diversification.
""The future, as I see it, is going to be defined by energy security. Earlier, global discourse was on energy transition, but no one talks about electricity access,"" he said.
Among the challenges faced in energy transition is round-the-clock availability of renewable power, Singh said. ""We need grid-scale battery storage and need to start manufacturing. We will be able to do that. But currently 77% of the world's manufacturing is in China,"" Singh said.
While India is trying to push battery storage system manufacturing by providing viability gap funding, it has also mapped out pumped hydro storage sites.
Niti Aayog vice chairperson Suman K Bery told the session that India's focus is on integrating energy transition with overall economic development.

Reliance Power makes a higher offer to lenders for Vidarbha Industries,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/reliance-power-makes-a-higher-offer-to-lenders-for-vidarbha-industries/articleshow/101089646.cms,19-06-2023,"Anil Ambani-promoted
Reliance Power
has made a revised and improved debt-settlement offer of `1,260 crore to the lenders of its
Vidarbha Industries Power
subsidiary, said people aware of the development. Reliance Power sweetened the offer after rival bidder CFM Asset Reconstruction Co improved its proposal.
ET first reported on CFM ARC's offer to lenders on March 30, followed by a report on an offer from government-owned National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL) on April 1 and a settlement offer by the promoter on May 22.
CFM ARC
initially offered `1,120 crore to the lenders, while NARCL offered `1,150 crore and Reliance Power made a `1,200 crore settlement proposal.
Reliance Power and CFM offered upfront cash, while NARCL’s offer is a combination of cash and security receipt. Early this month, CFM ARC improved its offer to `1,220 crore while Reliance Power made a revised offer of `1,260 crore. The offer by the promoter is backed by
Varde Partners
, which acquired a 15% equity stake in the company by infusing `930 crore in September last year. A Reliance Power spokesperson said: ""We are committed to maximise the value for our lenders.
Our proposal, accompanied with Swiss challenge ensures maximisation of value and transparency."" CFM ARC did not respond to ET’s request for comment. The battle to gain control of
Vidarbha Industries
may end after the lenders auction the company's loans. Reliance Power and CFM ARC have proposed to lenders that their offer should be considered as an anchor offer at the Swiss challenge auction, people cited above said.
The anchor bidder has a strategic advantage at a Swiss challenge auction since it has the first right to match any counter offer that lenders receive at the auction. Lenders, including
State Bank of India
,
Axis Bank
,
Bank of Baroda
,
Punjab National Bank
,
Canara Bank
and
Bank of Maharashtra
, will jointly decide next week on the proposals from the promoter and the two ARCs.
Icra
Ratings has assigned a ‘D’, or default category, rating on Rs 3,646 crore debt of the company. One of the people in the know of the matter, however, said the loans have now reduced to Rs 2,200 crore.

Vidarbha Industries operates two coal-based units of 300mw each at the Butibori industrial area in Nagpur.
The battle to acquire the power producer has stoked expectations of a quick recovery for lenders disheartened by the Supreme Court order rejecting a plea to admit the company for insolvency proceedings despite a default. Last July, the Supreme dismissed Axis Bank's petition to admit Vidarbha Industries for insolvency, stating that the National Company Law Tribunal, which approved admitting the company, should have considered external factors that had led to the delay in payments by the borrower.
At the heart of the matter is a claim made by Vidarbha Industries that has won an award of Rs 1,730 crore from the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity. This amount exceeded the Rs 553 crore claimed by Axis Bank. The company claimed it could not pay the lender because the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission challenged the award. The matter is now pending before the apex court.

Power demand in June may not touch projected 229GW mark,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/peak-power-demand-in-june-may-not-touch-projected-229gw-mark/articleshow/101080355.cms,18-06-2023,"Peak
power demand
is unlikely to touch or cross 229GW in summer this year due to unseasonal rains and the after-effects of cyclonic storm Biparjoy in the country, say industry experts.
According to the experts, unseasonal rains have brought down temperatures during summer, affecting demand.
According to the
Central Electricity Authority
estimates, the peak electricity demand was expected to be 229GW during April-June when the power demand is the highest in the country.
But experts say that monsoon will be active in the entire country by July and the seasonal rains would again result in lowering the demand for power.
The consumption of power dipped in March and remained almost flat in April this year. It again dipped in May, showing the impact of unseasonal rains in the country.

The peak power demand met or the highest supply in a day touched all-time record high of 223.23 GW on June 9, 2023. Thereafter it came down to 219.30GW on June 10 and further to 206.66GW on June 11.
The highest supply in a day again rose to 218.67GW on June 12 but dipped to 215.35GW on June 13 and 214.58GW on June 14. The peak power demand met remained ever lower at 210.90GW on June 15. It was 211.96 GW on June 16.
However, the power ministry has been taking steps to avoid any power shortage in the country.
The ministry asked all imported coal-based power plants to run at full capacity from 16th March 2023 to 15th June 2023 to meet any unprecedented rise in demand and consumption of electricity in the country. The timeline has been further extended by three and a half months till September 30, 2023.
The ministry had also asked the domestic coal-based thermal power plants to import coal for blending to avoid any shortfall of the dry fuel.
The government data also showed that the peak power demand met was 215.97GW in April and 221.34GW in May this year. The shortfall was just 170MW in April and 23 MW in May

Delhi
surpassed 7,000 MW on Tuesday, data from
State Load Despatch Center
showed, as temperatures soared in the city.
Peak demand
touched 7,098 MW at 3:29 pm in the national capital, the highest this
summer
season. However, peak demand so far in the city is still lower than last year's as western disturbances have kept the summer temperatures in check. Peak demand last year was recorded at 7,695 MW on June 29.
Last year in June, there were nine occasions when Delhi's power demand exceeded 7,000 MW.
The demand this summer has, however, not been very high as expected initially because of favourable weather conditions. Delhi's peak power demand has seen huge variations this summer with 4,390 MW on June 1 to the latest high.

West Bengal
government has pumped in Rs 27,000 crore into the power sector since 2011 for developing generation, transmission, and distribution capacity, state Power Minister
Arup Biswas
said on Tuesday. He said that further investments would be made in the next few years to increase the total power capacity from the current 9,521 MW to 13,689 MW, including thermal, solar, and hydel capacities.
Biswas
told reporters that West Bengal has sufficient power to meet the demand.
The recent power cuts were due to the breakdown of distribution networks caused by storms and unpermitted draw of electricity by a section of retail consumers, he claimed.
The highest demand was recorded on June 8 of this year and was successfully met.
The minister's statement came following Leader of the
Opposition
Suvendu Adhikari's allegation that the recent power cuts in the state have caused the sector to collapse.

Biswas said the state has phased out one thermal power unit each at Kolaghat plant and another at
Bandel
due to regulatory compliance.
The minister also said that the state had created a fresh total thermal capacity of 1,250 MW in these 11 years and is building new capacities, including a 660 MW supercritical power plant at Sagardighi in
Murshidabad
.
Apart from generation, various transmission and distribution infrastructure have been developed by the
Mamata Banerjee
government in its past two terms since 2011, Biswas said.
The state has plans to build a 1,760 MW solar capacity, 1,000 MW from the Turga Pumped storage power plant, and receive 230 MW from
Bhutan
and 118 MW from
Teesta
hydel projects.
According to the minister, the subscriber base has increased from 80 lakh during the previous Left
Front
regime to 2.33 crore today, with demand soaring to 9,200 MW from 4,085 MW earlier.

India set to start mega hydropower project near China border,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-set-to-start-mega-hydropower-project-near-china-border/articleshow/100956370.cms,13-06-2023,"India is close to starting a mega hydropower project that has been in the works for 20 years, a key step in the country’s energy transition.
State-run hydropower company
NHPC Ltd
. will start trial runs in July for the
Subansiri Lower
project that runs through the states of Assam and Arunchal Pradesh in the country’s north-east. The first unit is expected to be commissioned in December, according to finance director Rajendra Prasad Goyal. By the end of 2024, all eight units will be commissioned, he said.
Hydropower, with its ability to quickly respond to fluctuations in electricity demand, is seen crucial for balancing the grid as intermittent generation of solar and wind power rises. However the 2-gigawatt project, started in 2003, was delayed by protests and litigation, driven by concerns over environment damage.
The cost of the project jumped to 212.5 billion rupees ($2.6 billion), more than three times the original estimate. The
National Green Tribunal
allowed the work to resume in 2019 after eight years of suspension. Opposition to dams has limited the country to tapping barely a third of its hydropower potential of 145 gigawatts.
“We need to get nearly 40 approvals from different departments before we start building a hydropower project. All the scrutiny should be done at this stage,” Goyal said. “Any stoppages after the construction has begun is problematic.”
Live Events
Large dams are also India’s way of boosting local economies in areas along its tense borders with China and Pakistan. As
Subansiri
approaches conclusion,
NHPC
is finalizing plans to award construction orders for the 2.9-gigawatt
Dibang
project, the biggest hydropower plant India has planned to build.
To spur hydropower, the government has given large dams clean energy status. This forces provincial power distributors to prioritize purchase of hydropower ahead of electricity produced from fossil fuels. The government has also agreed to give budgetary support in some cases on civil construction and flood moderation work.

Peak power demand met touches all-time high of 223.23 GW on June 9,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/peak-power-demand-met-touches-all-time-high-of-223-23-gw-on-june-9/articleshow/100911003.cms,11-06-2023,"Peak power
demand
met or the highest
supply
of electricity touched an all-time high of 223.23 GW on June 9, showing the waning impact of unseasonal rains on consumption, government data showed. The
power ministry
had estimated that the peak power demand will easily touch 229 GW during this summer in April only. The unseasonal rains affected the demand and brought down temperature during summer, resulting in fewer use of cooling appliances like air conditioners which guzzle electricity, experts say.
Taking proactive measures, the power ministry had asked well in advance all imported coal-based power plants to run at full capacity from March 16, 2023 to June 15, 2023, to meet any unprecedented rise in demand and consumption of electricity in the country.
Besides, the ministry had asked the domestic coal-based thermal power plants to import coal for blending to avoid any shortfall of the dry fuel.
The government data shows that peak power demand met was 215.97GW in April and 221.34GW in May this year. The shortfall was just 170MW in April and 23 MW in May.
The experts said that the shortfall is miniscule which may be caused due to technical reasons.

Power trading: Government asks regulator CERC to begin process for coupling power exchanges,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-trading-government-asks-regulator-cerc-to-begin-process-for-coupling-power-exchanges/articleshow/100899550.cms,10-06-2023,"The power ministry has asked Central Electricity Regulatory Authority (
CERC
) to initiate the process of coupling multiple power exchanges, a mechanism which seeks to ensure uniformity in price discovery of energy at trading platforms. At present India has three power exchanges --
Indian Electricity Exchange
(IEX),
Power Exchange of India
(PXIL) and
Hindustan Power Exchange
(HPX).
In the present scenario, buyers and sellers at each exchange do trading of electricity and discover spot price separately at these exchanges. After coupling of exchanges, the price discovery would be uniform.
In a communique to the power regulator CERC, the ministry said, ""Several stakeholders approached the Ministry of Power on the subject of market coupling in the context of multiple power exchanges.
""The ministry of power has decided to go ahead with the process...CERC is requested to take suitable action, so that the process of consultation and the finalisation of the construct for its implementation is done expeditiously and the same can be implemented.""
Naveen Singh, head, business development at Hindustan Power Exchange, said in a statement that the decision to implement market coupling on power exchanges is a welcome move for the power market.

""We thank the power minister and the power ministry for initiating such a transformative reform. We are confident that the CERC would soon come up with the necessary regulatory framework to ensure its implementation at the earliest.""
He pointed out that this will give a fillip to the service levels in the power market, and ensure better transparency and uniform prices discovery across exchanges.
The move is also expected to bring down the power tariff in the country significantly, he opined.
An IEX spokesperson said, ""Today in India we have a voluntary market framework where all exchanges have equal opportunities. Market coupling is done to couple different markets operating in different geographies, which is not applicable in our case.""
The spokesperson explained that in India all the regions are already coupled and the country has one market and one price.
""Government has requested the CERC to initiate the process of consultation and finalisation of construction. I am sure all aspects like the objective of coupling and need in the current market framework will be examined,"" the spokesperson added.
The IEX has the largest market share of 88 per cent in total power trade at multiple exchanges in India.

Sarda Energy & Minerals and Ashish Rathi, resolution professional for SKS Power Generation (Chhattisgarh), did not respond to ET’s queries until press time Friday. BOB Capital markets who is the process advisor on the deal also did not respond to queries.
SKS Power Generation (Chhattisgarh) had drawn interest from several bidders including
Adani Group
and
Reliance Industries
at a preliminary stage. Eventually, those two backed out of the process.
The company has two power plants each with the capacity to generate 300 MW of power. The company had been ailing because the second power plant was not operational. During the insolvency process, the lenders infused interim finance in the company to operationalise the second power plant. The company became profitable after the second plant was started.
Sarda Energy & Minerals is said to have bid aggressively for the company because it also owns coal mines near the power plants of SKS Power Generation (Chhattisgarh) and has easy access to fuel, making the production of power more cost-effective.
Torrent Power is said to have shown interest in the company because it owns electricity distribution licences and the acquisition of a power producer would have helped it have an integrated business model. Naveen Jindal group also owns coal mines and its acquisition strategy was based on similar lines of Sarda Energy & Minerals.

Power ministry asks CERC to start process for market coupling,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-ministry-asks-cerc-to-start-process-for-market-coupling/articleshow/100858098.cms,09-06-2023,"The
power ministry
has requested the
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
(CERC) to initiate market coupling process of multiple electricity exchanges, which could make prices uniform across exchanges.
Several stakeholders had approached the ministry and it has decided to go ahead with the process, a letter from the ministry to the regulator said.
In this form of discovering prices, bids are accepted in all power exchanges, brought together to a market coupling operator that merges them and runs a single combined solution.
India has three power exchanges - India Energy Exchange (
IEX
),
Hindustan Power Exchange
(HPX) and
Power Exchange India
(PXI).
IEX commands 99.9% of the volume traded on the exchanges.

In the current state of market share, coupling does not make much difference, one industry source and a government official said.
However, market coupling could bring a possibility for other exchanges to gain market share in the day-ahead and real-time trading.
""This will give a fillip to the service levels in the power market, ensure better transparency and uniform prices discovery across exchanges. The move is also expected to bring down the power tariff in the country significantly,""
Naveen Singh
, head, business development at Hindustan Power Exchange said.
In India we have voluntary market framework where all exchanges have equal opportunities,
Rohit Bajaj
, head of business development, regulatory affairs & strategy, IEX, said.
Market coupling is done to couple different markets operating in different geographies which is not applicable in our case, he added.
""All the regions are already coupled, and we have one market and one price. Government has requested CERC to initiate the process of consultation and finalisation of construct. I am sure all aspects like objective of coupling and need in the current market framework will be examined,"" he said.
The move would make more impact when combined with the proposed market-based economic dispatch, which is a centralised model for scheduling and dispatching electricity, sources said.
The market-based economic dispatch ensures that cheapest power generating resources in the country will be supplied to meet the overall demand and result in saving for the consumers and distributors.

has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the
Maharashtra
government to set up three pumped storage hydro projects of 5,700 MW capacity.
The projects would entail an investment of about ₹27,000 crore and would provide employment to approx. 13,500 people over five years.
The projects would be executed at three sites identified by Torrent namely Karjat (3,000 MW) in Raigarh District, Maval, (1,200 MW) and Junnar (1,500 MW) in Pune District.
""All the sites are off-stream and the projects are planned to provide a minimum of six hours of energy storage on a daily basis,"" Torrent Power said.
The share of renewable power, which is intermittent in nature, is rapidly increasing in the grid. This necessitates energy storage for load management and meeting peak demand. Pumped storage hydro is an established, proven and cost-effective technology for firm, flexible and dispatchable power.

Odisha likely to shelve plan to divest 49% stake in Genco,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/odisha-likely-to-shelve-plan-to-divest-49-stake-in-genco/articleshow/100802874.cms,07-06-2023,"Odisha
government is likely to shelve plans to divest 49% of its stake in thermal power producer
Odisha Power Generation Corporation
, said people aware of the development.
The state government owns 100% equity but it announced plans to sell only 49% stake in January.
""The sale process anyway had generated poor response since potential applicants were interested in acquiring a majority stake. With 49% on the block and the government holding 51%, they (bidders) will not have complete control over running of the company,"" a senior executive with a big four consulting firm said.
The state government decided to sell equity to private investors two-and-a-half years after it acquired 49% back from US-based
AES Corporation
for Rs 1,000 crore.
In August 2000, Odisha government had blocked
Adani Power
from acquiring AES' stake in the thermal power company by invoking its right of first refusal, according to media reports.
Adani Power
had in June of that year offered to acquire AES' stake, but the Odisha government matched the offer.

Senior state government officials conveyed this decision to their advisor
SBI
Capital Markets, the people said. The state will run the process next year, and a formal communication will be sent out soon, they added.
SBI Capital Markets did not respond to ET's request for comment until press time.
While selling distressed power companies, lenders use a standard benchmark of Rs 3 crore per MW of generating capacity to value the company. Using the same benchmark, this company is valued at ₹5,230 crore.

Pumped Storage Hydro is an established, proven and cost-effective technology for firm, flexible and dispatchable power. PSH is a configuration of two water reservoirs at different elevations.
Water is pumped to the upper reservoir at the time of excess power when it is the cheapest. At the time of demand when power is expensive, water flow from upper reservoir to lower reservoir generates power with a hydraulic turbine. PSH is a much superior solution than Battery for energy storage as it is cheaper, has a longer life of 40 years, provides longer duration storage of 6 to 10 hours with feasibility of multiple cycle operations during the day.
Torrent Power
currently has an aggregate installed generation capacity of 4.1 GW, which consists largely of clean generation sources such as gas (2.7 GW) and renewables (1.07 GW).
It also has Renewable capacity of 0.7 GW under development. Torrent’s growth focus in
Power Generation
remains on Renewables.
""To complement its growing portfolio of renewables and distribution, Torrent is strategically entering the storage space to fulfill the void left in the grid by intermittent renewable power,"" the company said.

The government may also provide subsidies to some rural households if required, he said.
The Energy Efficiency Services Ltd will be roped in to put the model in place like it did with the government’s
Unnat Jyoti

“We want to promote
e-cooking
in a big way so that we move away from fossil to non-fossil fuel,” Tewari said. “We are trying to come out with electric cooking in such a manner that is affordable to even rural areas.”
Solar or solar-thermal combined cooking could be some models that need to be promoted, especially in the rural areas, where it may not be possible for poorer households to afford, Tewari said while addressing the Consumer-Centric Approaches for E-cooking Transition.

Through the
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana
(PMUY) the government made
clean cooking fuel
such as LPG available to the rural and deprived households.
“Now, let us move from clean cooking to e-cooking,” Tewari said.
A model has to be developed in a manner that electricity comes from renewable energy sources so that there is aggregation of carbon credits also, which will offset some cost.
It should be affordable in the sense that it should be linked with solar or some other renewable energy source which is cheaper, he said.
If we have standard and affordable models, we should be able to cover all urban areas within 2-3 years. By 2030, we would like to cover as many households as possible under e-cooking, he said.
Indian Oil Corporation
Ltd’s has already launched an indoor solar cooking system which operates both on solar and auxiliary energy sources simultaneously.
The initial cost of IOC’s product was around Rs 12,000 for base model, and Rs 23,000 for top model. However, the cost is expected to reduce substantially with economies of scale, as per the company.

India's power consumption grows marginally by 1.04 percent to 136.56 billion units in May,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-consumption-grows-marginally-by-1-04-percent-to-136-56-billion-units-in-may/articleshow/100676732.cms,01-06-2023,"Power consumption
rose marginally by 1.04 per cent to 136.56 billion units in May this year as widespread rains have kept summer temperature under check so far and people used fewer
cooling appliances
compared to last year. In the year-ago period, power consumption stood at 135.15 billion units (BU), higher than 108.80 BU in May 2021, according to government data.
The power consumption was also affected in March and April this year due to widespread rains in the country.
Experts said that unseasonal rains in March, April and May affected the power consumption in the country.
The power ministry has estimated the country's
electricity
demand to touch 229 GW during this summer season. But the demand has not reached the projected level during April-May this year mainly due unseasonal rains.
Rains reduced the demand for electricity as people used fewer cooling appliances compared to the previous year, according to experts.
Live Events
Further, experts are hopeful that power consumption and demand would grow from June onwards, due to further improvement in economic activities as well as a rise in temperature during summer season.
The data showed the
peak power demand
met, which is the highest supply in a day, rose to 221.34 GW in May, 2023.
The peak power supply stood at 204.47 GW in May 2022 and 168.78 GW in May 2021.
Peak power demand is expected to touch 229 GW during this summer season, as per the power ministry estimates.

Two-thirds of power capacity may come from non-fossil fuels by FY32,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/two-thirds-of-power-capacity-may-come-from-non-fossil-fuels-by-fy32/articleshow/100659562.cms,01-06-2023,"India should have more than two-thirds of its
electricity generation capacity
from non-fossil fuel sources by 2031-32, going by a decade-long plan rolled out by the
Central Electricity Authority
(CEA).
The share of non-fossil fuel-based capacity is likely to increase to 57.4% by FY27 from around 40% as of March 2022 and further to 68.4% by FY32, said
National Electricity Plan
, which is published every five years.
The plan provides a review of the projections for FY17 to FY22, detailed capacity addition requirements during FY22-FY27, and plan projections for FY27-FY32.
Growing environmental concerns and global thrust on adoption of clean energy generation technologies is going to have an impact on the share of
coal-based installed capacity
in the country in the foreseeable future, though the share of coal-based generation may continue to be high, the plan said.

Operation of coal-based plants in a more flexible mode, unlike as base load stations earlier, needs to be emphasised in the wake of huge intermittency and variability of renewable power generation.
CEA has forecasted an additional coal-based capacity requirement varying from 19 GW to around 27 GW by FY32 on top of under-construction coal-based capacity of 26.9 GW.
As per the plan, overall power capacity addition needed in FY22-FY27 to meet the peak demand and energy requirement of FY27 is 212 GW, comprising 32 GW of conventional capacity and 180 GW of renewable-based capacity. Similarly, capacity addition requirement during FY27-FY32 to meet the peak demand and energy requirement for FY32 is 292 GW, including 32 GW of conventional capacity.
The projected peak demand for FY27 is 277 GW and for FY32 is 366 GW. ""Coal-based capacity addition will depend on the demand growth, which has been quite robust for the last couple of years. However, our demand growth for FY24 is 5%,"" said
Sabyasachi Majumdar
, senior vice president at rating agency
ICRA Ltd
.
Renewable energy cannot meet round-the-clock power supply requirements until storage becomes viable for it to be a complete alternative to coal, he added.
The estimated installed capacity by the end of FY27 is 610 GW, including 273 GW of conventional power while that for FY32 is 900 GW, comprising 304 GW of conventional energy.
The current installed capacity of thermal power plants is 237 GW, while that of renewable energy, including large hydro, is 179 GW.
The latest electricity plan projects total fund required for setting up power plants in FY22-FY27 at ₹14,54,188 crore. Total fund requirement for FY27-FY32 is estimated to be ₹19,06,406 crore.
Based on the estimation of fund requirement for 2022-27, the authority has estimated that developers will be required to infuse equity totalling ₹3,63,547 crore and arrange debt of ₹10,90,641 crore.

ICRA sees power demand growth at 5-5.5% in FY24 vs 9.6% FY23,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/icra-sees-power-demand-growth-at-5-5-5-in-fy24-vs-9-6-fy23/articleshow/100656502.cms,31-05-2023,"Ratings agency
ICRA
projects electricity demand to grow at 5-5.5% in FY24, lower than the demand growth of 9.6% clocked in FY23, because of unseasonal rains dampening consumption in summer months this year.
The projection is slightly lower than its expectation for the gross domestic product growth for the fiscal at 6%, but higher than the historical average demand growth seen over the past 10 years, it said on Wednesday.
The likelihood of
El Nino
in FY24 may have a positive impact on electricity demand, it said.
Demand in the last financial year was supported by a severe heat wave, favourable base, and a revival in economic activity.
The rating agency expects a sustained growth in electricity demand to improve the visibility on the signing of new power purchase agreements for the thermal independent power producers.

ICRA projects the all-India thermal plant load factor to improve to 65.1% the ongoing financial year from 64.2% last year.
The average spot power tariffs in the day ahead market of the
Indian Energy Exchange
remained high at Rs 5.9/unit in FY23, owing to the sharp demand growth, coal supply constraints, and high open market coal prices.
While the prices are expected to moderate in FY24, with improved coal supply and moderation in demand growth, the tariffs are likely to remain higher at Rs 4.5/unit against a long-term average of Rs 3-3.5/unit, it said.
Further, the coal stock level for the domestic power plants is satisfactory at 13 days as on May 15, 2023, against 8 days in the corresponding period of the previous year.
Renewable Energy
ICRA expects the renewable energy capacity addition to rebound to 20 GW in FY24 from 15 GW in FY23, considering the time extension provided by the
power ministry
for solar and hybrid projects till March 2024, the relaxation of the approved list of models and manufacturers requirement and the likely moderation in the solar cell and module prices.
The solar power segment witnessed a slowdown in bidding activity in FY23 amid elevated module prices, challenges associated with the
ALMM
, and the imposition of duties on imported modules,
Vikram V
, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said.
While there is visibility on renewable energy capacity addition in the near term, a significant scale-up in tendering activity is required to meet the notified renewable purchase obligation targets over the medium term, he said.

As mandated, the discoms submitted their ARRs -- practically their annual budgets -- to the DERC on May 22.
The true-up petitions from the discoms basically reconcile projected versus actual expenses. These show a substantial standalone revenue gap of around Rs 2,906 crore for the different discoms -- Rs 252 crore for
NDMC
, Rs 1,289 crore for BRPL, Rs 525 crore for BYPL and Rs 841 crore for TPDDL.
The ARR projects revenue gaps of Rs 7,817 crore for 2023-24 -- Rs 357 crore for NDMC, Rs 3,794 crore for BRPL, Rs 1,629 crore for BYPL and Rs 2,037 crore for TPDDL.
As there has been no tariff increase since 2014, the discoms have requested the regulator to allow a cost-reflective tariff for 2023-24 to maintain ""uninterrupted"" and quality power supply to consumers in Delhi, the sources said.
The discoms have already approached Delhi High Court against the DERC's business plan regulations, seeking an interim stay against their enforcement. The business plan regulations serve as the framework for tariff determination by the regulator.
The DERC seems to be in a hurry to complete the process of power tariff determination despite the positions of the chairman of the panel and member (finance) lying vacant, the sources alleged.
No immediate reaction was available from the DERC over the charges.

India’s largest private utility is a key player in Modi’s pledge to provide power to every Indian home. In a media blitz on Monday, it touted itself as capable of “distributing electricity to every corner of the country.”
Yet the company faces a funding gap which may force it to infuse as much as $700 million by March 2026 to fulfill existing project commitments, according to the Indian unit of Fitch Ratings — and that’s before taking into account ambitions to expand even further in coming years.
Bloomberg
The funding needs of infrastructure builders like
Adani Transmission
are a major factor behind the conglomerate’s race to return to business as usual, after months of damage control and denying US short seller Hindenburg Research’s allegations of widespread corporate malfeasance. The stakes are also high for Modi, who faces national elections in early 2024 and has made infrastructure a core plank of his nation-building agenda.

Adani stocks rise most since January Hindenburg report
Adani Transmission, which went from being a fledgling to India’s largest private utility in seven years, has grown its asset portfolio 3.6 times to 19,779 circuit kilometers (ckm) across 33 projects.
Of these, 13 projects are currently underway, but many face delays or cost overruns, including the largest one: the
Warora-Kurnool Transmission
line that runs through three large southern Indian states.
Others have been beset by adverse weather, pandemic-era disruptions or legal wrangles — common issues in infrastructural projects in India which makes the Adani group the rare private company that has been scaling up aggressively in this space. With India planning to add more than 27,000 ckm of transmission lines by 2025, the company’s continued expansion will be crucial for the national goal.
The utility company earlier this month announced plans to raise as much as $1 billion — one of two Adani companies looking to issue new shares for the first time since the short seller crisis which wiped more than $100 billion off the empire’s market value.

What does Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners see in Adani Group that others don't?
“Adani Transmission has always been aggressive on capex so the $1 billion fundraising will help them maintain growth momentum at a time when the group as a whole has had to soften their targets to come out of this logjam,” said Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities Pvt.
“It might have to also raise additional debt to finance their capex requirements as the transmission business has high working capital needs,’ he said.
Bloomberg
Capital infusion required by March 2026 from the company in its ongoing projects has surged as much as 60% to 57.95 billion rupees ($700 million) compared to what was envisaged before, India Ratings and Research, the local unit of Fitch Rating’s, said in a March 30 statement. This is due to cost overruns or the borrowings not being enough to support the projects, forcing the utility firm to invest more.

India Ratings revised its outlook on Adani Transmission to “negative” to reflect this uncertainty around debt funding secured for the under-construction transmission lines. Any shortfall will require the company to invest more “to meet project completion deadlines, potentially creating cashflow mismatches over FY24,” it said.
An Adani Group spokesperson said in an email that the conglomerate does “not comment on routine business matters.” “All public disclosures on business matters are disclosed when appropriate,” the spokesperson said in response to queries on how Adani Transmission plans to plug the funding gap.
‘Best Possible Assets’
Some high-profile investors are convinced about the large role units like Adani Transmission play in the country’s development.
GQG Partners’s Chief Investment Officer Rajiv Jain, one of the first investors to show support for the conglomerate after the Hindenburg attack, told Bloomberg last week that GQG had raised its investment in the Adani empire and its holdings were now worth $3.5 billion.
Jain said he is willing to buy into the group’s new share sale because “these are the best possible infrastructure assets available in India.” Praising the conglomerate for its “quality of execution,” Jain said, “Who else in India is creating such quality infrastructure assets at this scale?”
Very few private sector firms in India have the risk appetite and ability to withstand the vagaries of infrastructure development in the sprawling, unwieldy country like Adani does.
Infrastructure projects are funded by a mix of debt and capital infusion, or equity, from the company. Delays, pricier inputs or legal challenges also push up project costs.
Bloomberg
Its largest project by length, Warora-Kurnool Transmission line, or
WKTL
, is facing a cost-overrun worth 6.7 billion rupees due to higher input and execution costs, India Ratings said at the end of March. The company “management confirmed that it will fully support the project to fund the entire cost-overrun,” it said in the statement.
Another project ——Adani Electricity Mumbai Infra Ltd. or AEMIL ——was slow to start as the Tata Group mounted a yearlong legal challenge against Adani’s license.
Eight Adani transmission lines are expected to be operational by March 2024 after some delay, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from company presentations and government websites.
Favorable Orders
The Adani Group’s effort to revert to pre-Hindenburg growth is gaining momentum from recent developments.
Besides being given reprieve earlier this month by a Supreme Court panel that found no evidence of regulatory failure or market manipulation so far in the episode, Adani Transmission has also won favorable regulatory orders to raise electricity tariffs in its operating projects to recoup past revenue shortfalls.
It’s another example of the company’s ability to navigate the difficulties of infrastructure building in India, as utilities generally cannot recoup higher costs incurred during project execution from end users as electricity tariffs are fixed through auctions. They need to petition the central or state regulator to approve higher tariffs, which usually involves a lengthy legal process.
The utility’s closely held subsidiary, Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd., got a favorable order at the end of March from the state power regulator which allowed it to raise tariffs charged to consumers by 2.2% in financial year 2024 and by 2.1% in 2025.
Nevertheless, many investors are still waiting to see if the unit can find the funding it needs before buying back into the stock. Its shares, which are down 67% this year, have been one of the slowest to recover from the Hindenburg rout among the group’s listed entities.
“For new buying to take place, there needs be a new investor,”said Deven Choksey, chief executive officer at local brokerage KR Choksey Shares & Securities. “We will have to wait for the proposed equity fundraise to conclude to see an appreciation of the stock.”

:
Delhi discoms
have approached the court against
Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission
over its 'Business Plan Regulations', an official said on Sunday. The discoms challenged the regulations issued by the power regulator in the
High Court
earlier this month, they said.
The matter is sub judice so nothing can be said officially said a top
DERC
official seeking anonymity.
The Business Plan Regulations when issued had invited the discoms to give their objections and suggestions but it is ""unfortunate"" that instead of approaching the DERC they took the matter to the court, he said.
""The discoms are pushing self interest as public interest. In fact, they are opposing the business plan regulations because it plugged all the loopholes they used to approach courts and get the annual tariff influenced to their benefit,"" he added.
""Many aspects of the Business Plans Regulations are in contravention of law and it has been challenged on various grounds, including violation of the principles of the Electricity Act, 2003, for being released without public hearing and that it is against DERC's own tariff policy,"" said a discom official who does not wish to be identified.

Nepal starts exporting electricity to India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/nepal-starts-exporting-electricity-to-india/articleshow/100550003.cms,27-05-2023,"Nepal
has started exporting
electricity
to India from Saturday, as the generation of
hydroelectricity
from run-of-the-river projects increased with the onset of the monsoon in the Himalayan country. Last year also, Nepal exported hydroelectricity to India from June to November.
""We have started selling 600 MW hour electricity to India from Saturday as there is a surplus in the electricity in the country,"" said Suresh Bhattarai, spokesperson of
Nepal Electricity Authority
.
Some time ago Nepal was importing up to 400 MW electricity from India to meet the domestic demand.
In Nepal the domestic demand for electricity increases in winter, while the supply decreases and in summer the demand decreases while the supply increases.
Most of the hydropower projects operating in Nepal are based on run-of-the-river. Last year, Nepal earned around 12 billion rupees from exporting electricity to India.

India's electricity supply improves in cooler pre-monsoon: Kemp,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-electricity-supply-improves-in-cooler-pre-monsoon-kemp/articleshow/100535315.cms,26-05-2023,"India
's electricity transmission network supplied a near-record amount of power in April but the system was much more stable than the year before thanks to lower temperatures and the return of some gas-fired generation.
Total electricity supplied was almost 131 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh), the fourth-highest monthly amount on record, based on data from the Grid Controller of India's
National Load Despatch Centre
.
But the total was down by more than 2.3 billion kWh (-1.8%) compared with the same month a year earlier when much of the country was sweltering in an early heatwave (""Monthly operation report"", Grid India, May 24).
On the densely populated northern plain, temperatures in
New Delhi
's Palam suburb averaged 28.2 degrees Celsius (82.8 degrees
Fahrenheit
) compared with 33.0 Celsius in the same month a year ago, cutting peak electrical loads for refrigeration and air-conditioning.
At the same time, extra generation was provided by solar farms (+1.8 billion kWh, or +23%) and coal-fired generators (+0.3 billion kWh, or +0.2%).
Live Events
These increases helped offset some of the reduced output from hydroelectric generators (-3.0 billion kWh, or -25%) and gas-fired units (-0.3 billion kWh, or -10%).
The combination of lower temperatures and increased solar generation significantly reduced stress on the transmission system, especially during the afternoon peak.
System frequency fell below the minimum acceptable threshold of 49.9 cycles per second (
Hertz
) only 11% of the time in April 2023 compared with a record 32% in April 2022.
Although gas-fired generation was down slightly compared with the previous year, it rose by more than 0.5 billion kWh compared with March, to the highest level for 12 months, as the cost of imported liquefied
natural gas
fell.
But despite lower average temperatures, peak
demand
increased by 4.2% compared with the year before, reflecting underlying load growth from the growing number of appliances connected to the system.
Rapid underlying load growth will continue to make the system vulnerable in future heatwaves.
COAL SECURITY
Coal-fired power generators held stocks equivalent to 12.8 days of consumption at the end of April, up from just 8.0 days at the end of the same month in 2022, reducing the risk of generator outages as a result of fuel shortages.
Domestic coal production increased by 35 million tonnes (+10%) in the first four months of 2023 versus the same period in 2022 as the government pressed for more output to avert a repeat of the previous year's blackouts.
The volume despatched to power producers via the railroads was up by a more modest 12 million tonnes (+5%) reflecting congestion on the network.
Combined with lower temperatures and lower generation, the increase in coal deliveries was sufficient to rebuild generator inventories to a more comfortable level and avoid previous fuel problems.

have taken Hyderabad-based

to court, claiming that the company has refused to part with the 29% stake it holds in
Lanco Anpara
Thermal Power to the power plant's winning bidder, Megha Engineering & Infrastructures.
ILabs held charge over 29% shares of Lanco Anpara after its purchase of

Last June, lenders voted in favour of Megha Engineering to takeover Lanco Anpara for a total consideration of ₹855 crore. However, iLabs has for the past one year refused to honour the contract and is demanding another ₹100 crore to transfer the stake, citing possible tax and other liabilities, said a person familiar with the matter.
""Banks have been patiently negotiating with iLabs for almost a year. They have been delaying the process and now have made this unreasonable demand. In fact, Megha also agreed to provide an indemnity to iLabs on any future liabilities, but they have been insisting on a cash payment which is why legal recourse is the only option,"" said a person familiar with the process.

V Anantha Nageswaran
on Thursday said issues around energy security are “the single-biggest worry” for an emerging economy like
India
for sustaining the elevated growth rates of the past two years over the medium-to-long term.
While addressing global warming assumes significance, it’s equally important for developing countries to ensure that there is adequate and affordable energy available for powering economic growth, he said, as he called on global lenders not to abruptly
shun fossil-fuel
projects in the name of green economy.
The Indian economy grew 9.1% in FY22, aided by a favourable base, and is expected to have expanded 7% or more in the last fiscal year.
“If the financial sector completely avoids funding fossil fuel-based power generation projects, then we will be putting in jeopardy economic growth,” he said at the annual session of the
Confederation of Indian Industry
. “And if we put economic growth in jeopardy, then generations of fiscal and private sector resources will be in jeopardy,” he added.
Private capex
Nageswaran said private investment may unfold “gradually rather than too furiously”. In sectors like steel and cement, it has already picked up, as capacity utilisation has gone past the crucial 75%-mark.

""I am optimistic about the private sector capital formation cycle in the country….It's already unfolding and perhaps it may unfold gradually rather than too furiously,” he said. “It's unfolding at a steady pace, which is good enough for us,” he added.
In the case of the US, I don't think rate cuts are so imminent. They have given an indication of a pause in June.
Robust financial sector
The Indian financial sector is doing exceedingly well amid global uncertainties with robust profitability and, therefore, it’s the right time to put in place systems that would ensure long-term growth and health of the system, the
CEA
said.
So elongation of the ongoing, strong financial and economic cycle is critical for a competitive economy, he said.
“Now we (financial sector entities) have great balance sheets, profitability has come back and there is great appetite among lenders and borrowers. It's all good news. But it's important to ensure that this cycle lasts longer and all the lessons learnt from the previous cycle (when indiscriminate lending took place) are not forgotten quickly. We shouldn't do that mistake,” he said.
Nageswaran called for boosting investments in technological advancements and skilling by financial sector entities to ensure “credit judgement is done as scrupulously and correctly as possible, and more importantly, as realistically as possible”. This would help ensure that “we have a longer financial cycle and a longer macro-economic upswing”, he said, adding that such a situation is better than “facing overheating (of the economy) and then retrenchment every three or five years as has happened in the past”.

(scheduled commercial date of operation or deadline to complete the project), then the developer will be banned from participating in project bidding for one year.
On the second such incident, the developer will be banned for five years, Singh said, adding that he is going to put this (rule) in (policy).
Power project developers are waiting for

Singh also said that until battery energy storage becomes viable,
India
would have to add thermal power capacity to meet the demand.

The company had acquired 1,753 megawatt for ₹10,150 crore, which translated to ₹5.77 crore per megawatt. In comparison, the asset it is building currently is at ₹7.5 crore per MW.
""Normalised Ebitda will be coming to around ₹1,650 crore, which translates to ₹943 crore per gigawatt as compared to what we are doing around ₹850 crore per gigawatt,"" Jain said. ""So, the return on
capital

ET Online
JSW Neo Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JSW Energy, completed the acquisition of Mytrah assets in March this year. This entailed acquisition of 15 special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and 13 ancillary SPVs having 1,449 MW of total installed renewable energy capacity. The said 28 subsidiaries of MEIPL have now become subsidiaries of JSW Neo and accordingly step-down subsidiaries of the company.
The Mytrah portfolio of 1,753 MW comprises 1,331 MW of wind capacity and 422 MW (487 MWp DC) of solar capacity operating primarily in the southern, western and central parts of India. The assets have a proven operational track record and long-term
PPA
with an average remaining life of 17 years.
With about 2.9 GW of under-construction projects, which are likely to be commissioned in phases over the next 12-18 months, JSW Energy is well ahead of its target to reach 10 GW operating assets by FY25 with the share of renewables increasing to 61%, the company said.

India working on small modular reactors: Jitendra Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-working-on-small-modular-reactors-jitendra-singh/articleshow/100448604.cms,23-05-2023,"India is working on new technologies such as the
small modular reactors
that can be factory-built and help make clean energy transition, Science and Technology Minister
Jitendra Singh
said here. Singh, in an interview to PTI, also said the government had opened up the nuclear power sector for joint ventures with public sector undertakings but not for the private sector.
Small Modular Reactors (SMR), with up to 300 MW capacity are flexible in design and require a smaller footprint. Being mobile and agile technology, SMR can be factory-built unlike the conventional nuclear reactors that are built onsite.
A recent
NITI Aayog
report said, as many SMR designs were under various stages of research, development and licensing in different countries, global regulatory harmonisation, developing the manufacturing ecosystem and bringing in public as well as private capital would be the key for growth of the SMR industry.
""We are already working on it. I think as times come, we have to move with the global world. SMR may become the order of the day. We are open to these new technologies and we are also adapting to them very fast,"" Singh said.
The minister said for the first time, the Modi government had approved a proposal to build 10 nuclear reactors under ""fleet mode"".

The state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (
NPCIL
) builds and operates almost all of the atomic power plants in the country.
In 2015, the government amended the Atomic Energy Act to enable joint ventures between the NPCIL and public sector companies to build nuclear power projects.
""Earlier, they were not partnering with anybody. So, we naturally had constraints on resources, finances. Now, we already have two important partnerships with
Indian Oil Corporation
and
NTPC
. We have moved in that direction, though not yet with the private,"" said Singh.
Earlier this month, the NPCIL signed a supplementary joint venture agreement with National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) to develop two 700 MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors at Chutka in Madhya Pradesh and four 700 MW PHWRs at Mahi Banswara in Rajasthan.
The NPCIL has also formed joint ventures with
Indian Oil
Nuclear Energy and
Nalco
Power Company Limited for expansion of the nuclear power sector.
India's current installed nuclear power capacity is 6780 MW and it plans to add 21 more atomic power generating units with a total installed capacity of 15,700 MW by 2031.

The average price in May so far has been ₹4.7 a unit compared, lower than the ₹6.4 per unit in the same period last year. This is despite the 'maximum demand met' touching an all-time high of 221 GW on May 17.
Wet spells in the last two days in West Bengal and some parts of

Lower-than-expected temperatures in early summer and preparedness for projected peak demand of around 231 GW helped in maintaining sufficient capacities for any increase in power demand.
""Many state discoms have started meeting a major portion of their expected demand through e-reverse auction and many other monthly and weekly contracts available on exchanges,"" said
Naveen Singh
, head of business development at
Hindustan Power Exchange
.
""These not only give them certainty of power but also keeps the day-ahead market prices under check.""
COAL STOCKS
Despite a rise in demand, coal stocks at the power plants did not see much depletion during the period owing to better planning, planned import and increased captive supply, two senior officials said.
The stock at power plants as on May 20 was 36.3 million metric tonnes, including import, marginally lower than the 36.5 million metric tonnes on May 1, as per government data.
""The current supply of domestic coal to power plants is around 2.2 million metric tonnes per day, whereas the consumption is around 2.3 million metric tonnes. So, depletion is marginal,"" a senior government official said.
Coal output at captive power plants has also increased, which has reduced the burden on the supply chains, leading to better availability of rakes for other units.

Vidarbha has obtained secured rupee and foreign currency term loans from banks and the outstanding loan was at ₹2,216.43 crore as of March 31, 2022, according to Reliance Power's annual report. The company's total borrowing including short-term and long term is ₹3,264 crore, according to a note by rating firm
ICRA
on February 1.
A Reliance Power spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Varde Partners could not be reached immediately for comment.
There are two other offers before the lenders and the joint lenders' forum will meet soon to decide on the three proposals.
CFM Asset Reconstruction made an all-cash offer of ₹1,120 crore to the lenders.
NARCL had also made an offer of ₹1,150 crore to the lenders as reported by ET. NARCL has offered to pay 15% as upfront cash, while the balance will be paid over the next five years.
""All bids are unsolicited as lenders have not started the process,"" said a lender. ""Lenders have been meeting to discuss the two bids. Lenders will meet next week to discuss the settlement proposal and the two bids by CFM ARC and NARCL.""
Vidarbha Industries Power has been incurring losses over the last few years. Its plant has been non-operational since January 2019 and its power purchase agreement with Adani Electricity Mumbai was terminated on December 16, 2019, due to below-threshold availability in certain years.
The company had challenged the validity and legality of the termination letter, it has received unfavourable rulings from the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission and the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity and currently, the matter is pending with the
Supreme Court
, according to the ICRA report.
The lenders had initially entered into the inter-creditor agreement on July 6, 2019, to restructure the debt outside of the court. However, the debt wasn't restructured under the framework and the agreement expired in January 2020.
After the expiry of the agreement, Axis Bank filed an application under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for initiation of corporate insolvency, but the Supreme Court turned it down.
On July 12, 2022, the Supreme Court in a significant ruling said that while financial creditors have the right to initiate the corporate insolvency resolution process, NCLT has the discretion to admit or reject the application despite the existence of a default. In January 2023, the government proposed an amendment to the IBC to clarify that the NCLT must admit an application if there is a defined default.
Vidarbha Industries Power operates a domestic coal-based project with a capacity of 600 MW (2x300 MW) at the Butibori Industrial Area in Nagpur, Maharashtra.

""Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case... has reasonable cause to believe that the company and its officers in default had violated the provisions of section 189 r.w. 188 the Companies Act, 2013,""
RV Mishra
, adjudicating officer of
RoC-Gujarat
said in his order.
The ministry of corporate affairs had in April 2018 ordered an inquiry under Section 206(4) of the Companies Act.
Determining the quantum of penalty, the RoC noted that the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the notice or loss caused to the investors as a result of the delay to redress the investor grievance were not available on record.
""Further, it may be added that it is difficult to quantify the unfair advantage made by the notice or the loss caused to the investors in a default of this nature,"" it said.
According to the order dated May 16, the presenting officer - who presents the case with evidence and witnesses before the adjudicating authority - submitted that the company ""had not furnished documentary evidence related to transactions in ordinary course of business and arm's length basis to the inquiry officer"".
The officer, in his submission, had said every director of the company should be liable for a penalty for each FY separately.

"Discoms' dues down by a third to Rs 93,000 crore in less than a year of enforcing Late Payment Surcharge Rule",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/discoms-dues-down-by-a-third-to-rs-93000-crore-in-less-than-a-year-of-enforcing-late-payment-surcharge-rule/articleshow/100392220.cms,21-05-2023,"The total outstanding dues of electricity
distribution
utilities (discoms) has reduced by a third to around Rs 93,000 crore in May, in less than year of implementing the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) Rules in June 2022. The burgeoning dues of discoms toward power generation (gencos) mainly and transmission (trancos) firms have been affecting the entire value chain of the sector till last year.
According to industry data, in June last year, discoms' dues were at Rs 1.39 lakh crore at the time of the launch of the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) scheme.
The total outstanding dues now stand at around Rs 93,000 crore as per the portal PRAAPTI (
Payment Ratification And Analysis
in Power
procurement
for bringing Transparency in Invoicing of generators).
The PRAAPTI portal was launched in May 2018, to bring transparency in power purchase transactions between generators and discoms.
Experts believe the strict implementation of the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) Rules can make the power sector more viable.
Live Events
The Rule ensures that the outstanding discom dues are paid well in time. Besides, it has also ensured the payment of current dues in time. The scheme has played a key role to bring financial discipline among discoms.
The non-payment of current dues by discoms, one month after the due date of payment or two and half months after the presentation of power bill, whichever is later, shall attract regulation (power
supply
cut) of power under the the Late Payment Surcharge Rules, 2022.
Apart from this the power ministry had also provided for strong payment
security
management and made it mandatory for discoms to open credit letters or make payment of power supply well in time to ensure financial discipline.
During the first wave of the pandemic, in May 2020, the government announced a Rs 90,000 crore
liquidity
infusion for discoms under which government-owned
Power Finance Corporation
(PFC) and
REC Ltd
were to give loans at economical rates in order to enable gencos afloat from the impact of the outbreak.
Later, the infusion package was raised to Rs 1.2 lakh crore and further to Rs 1.35 lakh crore.

SKS Power's lenders to seek more time to seal resolution,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/sks-powers-lenders-to-seek-more-time-to-seal-resolution/articleshow/100338223.cms,19-05-2023,"Lenders to the insolvent
SKS Power Generation
(Chhattisgarh) are seeking an extension to the resolution timeline of the 600 MW plant amidst intense competition among the four bidders to take over the company.
The resolution process timeline, which was initiated in April 2022, ends on May 25 after taking into account the various procedural delays. But banks will petition the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) as soon as Friday to extend the timeline by at least 15 days to ensure enough time for voting. ""All four bids have been examined but voting on the plans has not started yet because all bids are so close, so lenders needed to dig deep for the assessment. Voting is likely to commence sometime next week for which an extension is needed,"" said a person aware of the process.
Nagpur-based Sarda Energy & Minerals, Delhi-based Jindal Power, Gujarat-based
Torrent Power
and Singapore-based Vantage Point Asset Management have all made aggressive bids with very little difference between them.
The company owes ₹1,890 crore to the
Bank of Baroda
and the
State Bank of India
. Bankers expect to recover all their dues and also insolvency process costs of close to ₹200 crore as the plant is in high demand and is a rare working power plant available for sale.
Adani Group,
NTPC
and
Reliance Industries
were also in the race at one time but did not submit revised bids, ET reported in March.

""It's close with all three domestic companies very keen given the nature of the plant and a deep-pocketed foreign fund also involved. It is almost certain that lenders will get all their dues like in the case of
Binani Cement
. So, it all depends on how much the bidders are keeping on the table for operational creditors,"" said a second person aware of the process.
Process advisor BoB Capital Markets, lead lender Bank of Baroda and resolution professional Ashish Rathi did not immediately reply to ET's email seeking comment.
Two domestic bidders have some synergies with the plant with Jindal having a 3,600 MW power plant within 60 km of this one whereas Sarda has a coal mine less than 50 km from this plant. For cash-rich Torrent Power, it is a great acquisition because it adds to its 3,092 MW generation capacity in line with its ambitious growth plans.
The acquisition is also economical, coming to less than ₹4 crore per MW, compared with ₹9 crore per MW required to build a similar plant today. Demand is also expected to be strong in a power-deficient country like India.

Power ministry panel outlines roadmap to develop electricity market,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-ministry-panel-outlines-roadmap-to-develop-electricity-market/articleshow/100232988.cms,14-05-2023,"A
power
ministry-constituted panel has suggested a roadmap outlining the interventions for the near, medium, and long term for the development of the electricity market.The interventions suggested by the panel include setting up a mechanism to monitor whether adequacy of supply is being maintained by the state utilities, enhancing the efficacy of the Day-ahead Market, introducing a market-based mechanism for secondary reserves, and implementing 5-minutes based metering, scheduling, dispatch, and settlement.
The proposed changes also include demand response and aggregation, which could reduce reserve requirements and lower electricity costs, according to a power ministry release.
There will be strengthening of market monitoring and surveillance activities to keep track of participation and prevent price volatility. A regional-level balancing framework for deviation management will be implemented which would result in reduction in deviation penalties for the States at the ISTS level and consequently lower the reserve requirements.
The ministry constituted a Group for ""
Development of Electricity Market
in India"" under the chairmanship of S Power Secretary Alok Kumar with representation from Ministry of Power, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, Central Electricity Authority, Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, Grid Controller of
India
(Grid-India) along with state governments.
The Group presented the report to Union Minister of Power and New & Renewable Energy, R. K. Singh, a power ministry statement said.

The Group proposed solutions to address key issues, including the dominance of inflexible long-term contracts, harnessing the inherent diversity of a large and synchronous grid and the need for
Resource Adequacy
planning in Centre and States.
Issues like reduction in system inefficiencies through lesser
reliance
on self-scheduling, increasing share of renewables in the overall energy mix, encouraging market participation for renewables, and firmness in
procurement
of ancillary services through well-developed ancillary services market also sought to be addressed by the group.
The solutions are aimed at creating an efficient, optimal, and reliable market framework to enable the energy transition and integration of renewable energy into the grid.
The Group has outlined the roadmap and specific recommendations in the redesign of the Indian electricity market of the future.
India's electricity
markets
are set to undergo significant changes in the shift towards renewable energy.
Singh said the proposed reforms are crucial to meeting India's renewable energy targets, and will also create a conducive environment for investment in renewable energy.
The changes will enable better grid integration of renewable energy and pave the way for a cleaner, greener future.
Singh said that India's energy transition towards renewable energy has further highlighted the need for enabling operational and electricity market developments to operate under a new energy order. The minister also said that we need to find out our own solutions instead of depending on the practices being followed in other countries.
""India has been in forefront of taking timely interventions and was able to keep electricity prices in check during the energy crisis in last one year whereas electricity prices shot up many times in electricity markets of many developed countries,"" Singh added.
The Minister emphasized on the need of ensuring procurement of most efficient power generation capacity while designing the capacity contracts and also agreed with the recommendations of having long term PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) of 12-15 years duration now onwards.
The Union Minister also directed to immediately undertake development of new RE capacity based on Contract for Difference (CfD) methodology in order to ensure competition and transparency. He directed that the power exchange clearing engine may be validated by the
CERC
.
According to the latest data for 2022-23, the total traded volume in the Indian electricity market was 1,02,276 MU (million units), which represents only a small portion of the energy generated from all sources (including RE) of 16,24,465 MU.
The peak demand for electricity in 2022-23 was 215.8 GW, and it is expected to increase to 335 GW by the year 2029-30.The Ministry of Power's initiatives towards electricity market reforms, coupled with the proposed interventions by the
Group for Development of Electricity Market
in India, will transform India''s electricity markets and help the country achieve its energy goals in a sustainable manner.

Competitive sale process
The transaction follows a competitive sale process that attracted interest from investors across the world, it said.
About half a dozen domestic and global energy developers, including
Jindal Steel and Power
, Actis and an arm of International Holding Corporation of Abu Dhabi, were there in the last stage apart from Indigrid.
Virescent was established in 2020 to acquire renewable energy assets in India. It has 16 operating solar projects totalling 538 MW of capacity with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 4,121 crore as of March 31. In September 2021, Virescent became India's first privately listed renewables-focused InvIT.
In 2021, Virescent raised Rs 460 crore in a round led by Alberta Investment Management Corp (
AIMCo
), one of Canada's largest institutional investment managers.
Terra Asia Holdings II Pte
is sponsor of the trust and affiliated with KKR.
According to Crisil, around 90% of the Virescent
portfolio
is covered by power purchase agreements (PPAs) with a pre-determined tariff for a tenure of 25 years. The remaining capacity has been tied up for 12 years from the start date of commercial operations. This provides revenue visibility, minimises offtake risk and ensures steady
cash flow
, it said.
Set up in 2016, IndiGrid is India's first and largest InvIT in the power transmission sector. It owns, operates, and manages transmission networks and renewable energy assets that deliver reliable power. It owns 17 power projects with transmission lines of more than 8,416 ckm, 14 substations with 17,550 MVA transformation capacity, and 100 MWAC of solar generation capacity.
""We are delighted to enter into this landmark transaction with IndiGrid, given our common strategic focus to expand our renewable energy portfolio and synergies across both platforms, after a highly competitive process,"" said Sanjay Grewal, chief executive officer, Virescent. ""As India marches towards becoming the most populous country, renewable energy solutions will grow in its importance as an energy source for its citizens and economic progress.""
India's major energy-focused InvITs are Indigrid, Virescent and Edelweiss' AnZen India Energy Yield Plus Trust. The Mahindra Group also plans to float an InvIT for Mahindra Susten, its renewable energy platform.
KKR-owned Indigrid and Edelweiss' AnZen hold portfolios of power transmission and renewable energy assets, while Virescent is a pure renewable energy trust.

Supreme Court upholds ₹278-crore award in Reliance Infra's favour,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/supreme-court-upholds-278-crore-award-in-reliance-infras-favour/articleshow/100142668.cms,11-05-2023,"New Delhi: The
Supreme Court
on Wednesday upheld the ₹278-crore arbitral award
Anil Ambani
's
Reliance Infrastructure
won against the
Goa
government in a dispute related to non-payment of electricity dues supplied by the company.
A bench led by Justice Dinesh Maheswari set aside the Bombay High Court's judgment that partially quashed the February 2018 arbitration award.
While restoring the award in its ""entirety"", the SC said, ""the view so taken by the tribunal cannot be said to be wholly perverse or suffering from patent illegality so as to be interfered with.""
""Needless to observe that even if two views are possible, the court cannot substitute its own view with that of the tribunal.""
The tribunal was well within its jurisdiction to award interest at a 15% rate and there was no justification to reduce the same to 10%, it said, while rejecting the Goa government's appeal. The sole arbitrator had directed the Goa government to pay
Reliance Infra
₹278 crore with interest till Oct 31, 2017, and a further 15% interest per annum till full payment.
Live Events
The company had in 1997 entered into a power purchase agreement with the Goa government to commission and operate a 39.8 MW
power plant
between 1999 to 2014. The arbitrator ruled in favour of Reliance Infrastructure following disputes over pricing.
The award was upheld by the commercial court but the High Court reversed the material parts of the findings in the award and reduced the amount payable by the state government, besides lowering interest rates. Both parties filed cross-appeals in the SC.

India's nuclear power industry may be opened to foreign investments,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-considering-allowing-foreign-investment-in-nuclear-power/articleshow/100015038.cms,05-05-2023,"India
is considering overturning a ban on foreign investment in its nuclear power industry and allowing greater participation by domestic private firms, two government sources told Reuters, as part of a push for cleaner energy.
The measures have been recommended by a government panel, set up by think-tank
Niti Aayog
which is headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Under India's Atomic Energy Act 1962, the government plays a central role in developing and running nuclear power stations.
Domestic private companies are allowed to participate as ""junior
equity
partners"" by supplying components and helping build them. The panel has recommended changes to the act and to India's foreign investment policies so that both domestic and foreign private companies can complement nuclear power generation by public companies.
The aim is to reduce carbon emissions and nuclear is in focus because it can
supply
energy 24/7, unlike solar energy, said the officials, who declined to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media.

The Department of Atomic Energy has said previously that several foreign companies including Westinghouse Electric, GE-Hitachi, Electricite de France and Rosatom were interested in participating in the country's nuclear power projects as technology partners, suppliers, contractors and service providers.
India does not allow foreign investment in the nuclear power sector.
The officials said the emphasis was on private participation through small modular reactors (SMRs) to fast-track nuclear energy generation, which accounts for 3% of India's total power production. Coal fires three quarters of it.
The Department of Atomic Energy, which works directly under the prime minister, and
Niti Aaayog
did not respond to emails and messages seeking comment.
Factory-built and ready-to-shift, each SMR produces up to 300 megawatts (MW) and requires less capital, time and land than conventional reactors. They can also safely be deployed in populated areas, the officials said.
State-run Nuclear Power Corp of India Ltd. (NPCIL) and
Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam
are the only two nuclear power generators in India. Thermal power company
NTPC
and oil
marketing
firm
Indian Oil Corp
, both government-controlled, have formed partnerships with
NPCIL
for nuclear power.
An Indian minister overseeing atomic energy, Jitendra Singh, said in November the country should explore private players' participation in developing SMRs. In the same month, the atomic energy department held closed-door consultations with domestic and global industry players who showed significant interest, one of the officials said.
""With the right policy push, we see private sector taking up significant deployment in the country,"" said the official.
The recommendations will next be submitted to Modi's office, said the officials, without giving a timeline. The government panel has also recommended replacing old coal-based plants with SMRs, amid a proposal to amend its electricity policy to not add any new coal-fired power plants, sources have told Reuters.
India's current nuclear power capacity is 6,780 MW and it is adding 21 more units with a capacity of 7,000 MW by 2031. The country is a signatory to international conventions on nuclear safety and will have to ensure that private companies comply with standards. India imports uranium fuel for nuclear plants from Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, France and Canada under bilateral agreements.

Central Electricity Authority revises down FY30 peak power demand projection a tad,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/central-electricity-authority-revises-down-fy30-peak-power-demand-projection-a-tad/articleshow/99995871.cms,04-05-2023,"The
Central Electricity Authority
(
CEA
) has projected a peak
power demand
of 335 gw and 2.28 trillion units of electricity for the year 2029-30. This is slightly lower than the 340 gw peak demand anticipated by the authority in its last report in 2020.
The projected peak demand for FY30 is 45% higher than the about 230 gw estimate for the current financial year.
The reassessment was seen as necessary after pandemic-related delays in some projects, India's updated nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, change in the cost trajectory of battery energy storage systems, and green hydrogen production, among others.
An additional 16,204.5 mw of coal-based power will be required to meet the electricity demand in 2029-30 apart from the 26,900 mw currently under construction.
A renewable energy-based capacity of 180.4 gw - 145.9 gw solar and 34.5 gw wind - is estimated in the given timeline in addition to the 117 gw currently in the planning and implementation stage. An additional capacity of 389 mw of large hydro projects is also required till 2030 apart from the capacity of 11,494 mw currently under construction.

The share of thermal power will reduce to 35.5% in the installed capacity in 2029-30 from 57% currently because of the projected renewable energy capacity addition. On the other hand, clean energy-based capacity in the period will increase to 62.4% as compared to 41.4% as of March 2023.
The non-fossil fuel-based capacity is likely to be at 500.6 gw, which is in line with the government's target, constituting about 64% of the total capacity mix.
The battery energy storage system capacity estimate for FY30 is up to 41.65 gw from the 27 gw projected in the previous report because of the government's latest push for storage.
Dynamic Factors
The impact of electric vehicles considered in the projected peak demand in 2029-30 is 3 gw while the electricity requirement is pegged at 15 billion units in energy requirement.
Energy requirement offset due to solar rooftop installation has been estimated at 34.8 billion units and that due to solar pump installation at 2.4 billion units for the timeline.
Additional energy requirement on account of green hydrogen production of around 10 million tonnes, considering only 5 million tonnes load on the grid, has been estimated as 250 billion units.

India may amend power policy draft to halt new coal-fired capacity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-may-amend-power-policy-draft-to-halt-new-coal-fired-capacity/articleshow/99991232.cms,04-05-2023,"India plans to stop building new coal-fired power plants, apart from those already in the pipeline, by removing a key clause from the final draft of its National Electricity Policy (NEP), in a major boost to fight climate change, sources said.
The draft, if approved by the cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would make China the only major economy open to fresh requests to add significant new coal-fired capacity.
India and China account for about 80% of all active
coal
projects as most developing nations wind down capacity to meet climate targets. As of January 2023, only 20 countries have more than one coal project planned, according to E3G, an independent climate think tank.
""After months of deliberations, we have arrived at a conclusion that we would not need new coal additions apart from the ones already in pipeline,"" one of three government sources said.
The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. India's power ministry did not respond to requests seeking comment.

The new policy, if approved, would not impact the 28.2 GW of coal-based power in various stages of construction, the sources said.
China and India have together been lobbying for freedom for countries to choose a roadmap to cut emissions.
India, whose proposed
coal power
capacity is the highest after China, had repeatedly refused to set a timeline to phase out coal, citing low per-capita emissions, surging renewable energy capacity and demand for inexpensive fuel sources.
Coal is expected to be the dominant fuel in generating electricity in India for decades, but activists have pressed for a halt to new coal-fired plants, arguing this would at least help to reduce the share of the polluting fuel in overall power output.
The draft, India's first attempt at revising its electricity policy enacted in 2005, also proposes delaying the retirement of old coal-fired plants until energy storage for renewable power becomes financially viable, the sources said.
So far, old coal-fired power plants with a cumulative capacity of 13 GW have been earmarked for functioning post retirement deadline to meet high power demand, they said.
CHANGE IN STANCE
In the first draft of the NEP in 2021, India had said it may add new coal-fired capacity, though it proposed tighter technology standards to reduce pollution.
The Central Electricity Authority, an advisory body to the federal power ministry, had said last year India might have to add as much as 28 GW of new coal-fired power in addition to the plants under construction to address surging power demand.
However, the final draft, which will guide India's policymaking on energy over the next decade, features no references to new coal-fired power, the sources said.
In contrast, China's National Development and Reform Commission said in a March 2022 document that outlined its energy policy, that the world's largest coal user ""will rationally build advanced coal-fired power plants based on development needs.""
China plans to build some 100 new coal-fired power plants to back up wind and solar capacity, which analysts said goes against Beijing's stated intention to reduce the role of coal.
The policy revision could also impact long-term coal prices and miners in Indonesia, Australia and South Africa, as India is the world's second-largest coal importer.

Under the plan, coal companies will focus on evacuating coal through first-mile connectivity, deliver more from shallow areas, and develop cemented roads for movement of trucks, coal secretary Amrit Lal Meena told ET.
""With these, we are hopeful that the availability of coal at power plants will be sufficient and on target,"" he said.
The planning focus has now moved to the second quarter as there is lesser coal stock depletion at present owing to favourable weather conditions, but supply may get stretched due to rains impacting operations.

The government was focused on delivering large quantities in the first quarter, anticipating a surge in demand in April.
First-mile connectivity refers to the transportation of coal from pitheads to dispatch points without road transportation of coal in mines. It includes railway sidings near coal mines and mechanised coal transportation and loading system that crush, size coal and provide speedy computer-aided loading.
In the larger mines, cemented roads have already been developed, which will help in the rainy season, Meena said.
Shallow mines are those that are new with less depth compared to those that have been excavated for a longer period.
The target of total coal production for July-September quarter this year is 203.2 million metric tonnes while that of offtake to power plants is 180.3 mt.
In the last financial year, the target of offtake to power plants for the same period was 155.9 million metric tonnes but the actual delivery was much higher at 165 mt because of higher domestic fuel demand.
So far, there have been no transportation challenges as railways have been providing sufficient rakes, Meena said.
Coal stock at power plants as of April 30 was at 35.8 mt, much higher compared with 21.9 mt on the same day last year.
Stock at power plants have consistently remained above 30 million metric tonnes over the last four months, which means the supply is meeting the demand, Meena said.
Adequate rakes for coal transport have also been provided so far and depletion in summer months starting March has been marginal, he added.
The cooler-than-expected weather in north India also helped temper demand in April when a 231 GW peak was expected. The highest demand so far was on April 17 at 216 GW.

Nuclear Power Corporation of India
on Monday to develop nuclear electricity generation projects.
The joint venture will initially develop two pressurized heavy-water reactor projects - 1,400 MW Chutka in Madhya Pradesh and 2,800 MW Mahi Banswara in Rajasthan.
State-owned NTPC had earlier said it planned to foray into nuclear power and get into fuel tie-up pacts with Uranium Corporation of India to ensure requisite availability.
The largest power generator in India aspires to become a 130-GW company by 2032 of which 2,000 MW will be from nuclear sources. However, the entire capacity of the two projects may come online by 2035, the company had earlier said.
""We are confident that out of the Chutka and Mahi Banswara, we will be definitely completing 2,000 MW,"" it had said.

The government is giving a push to nuclear power projects to meet its clean energy targets and diversify its electricity generation sources.
India is not very rich in fossil fuel resources and considering the large and growing energy demand, all energy sources are deployed optimally, the government said earlier.

Statkraft group firms move Himachal Pradesh high court against water usage cess,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/statkraft-group-firms-move-himachal-pradesh-high-court-against-water-usage-cess/articleshow/99820986.cms,28-04-2023,"Units of Norway-owned
Statkraft
have moved
Himachal Pradesh
’s high court challenging a decision by the state government to impose a water usage cess on
hydro power
generators who are operating projects in the hill state, according to sources in the know.
“We have challenged the decision on the grounds of legislative competence”, said a lawyer representing A.D Hydro Power and Malana Power, both of which are JV’s between Statkraft and LNJ Bhilwara group. Statkraft has a 49% stake in the JV's and LNJ Bhilwara owns 51% stake. LNJ Bhilwara is the dominant partner in terms of its financial investment in the JV companies. Generally, the dominant shareholder is likely to have greater control over decision making in a company.
The water usage cess is expected to raise operating costs of hydro power generation companies in the state by upto 25% and could make several projects financially unviable, according to industry experts. Over 172 projects in the state are expected to be impacted by the new levy.
Greenko, JSW and GMR are among other hydro power developers that operate projects in Himachal Pradesh. Atleast two of them are also considering litigation, according to sources.
Statkraft, LNJ Bhilwara, Greenko, JSW and GMR did not comment when contacted.

“Himachal has been a successful model for hydro power generation. It has provided uninterrupted electricity to people. Nobody will come forward to make new projects because of this levy”: said MM Madan, Jindal Steel’s former hydro power chief.
Hydro power experts noted that projects which don’t have power purchase agreements with state electricity boards will be hit the hardest. They will have to absorb the impact of the cost increase because they would be unable to pass on higher tariffs to their customers. For instance, Statkraft’s unit Malana Power sells the electricity it generates to
PTC India
. It cannot change the rates. GMR and Greenko
supply
power to industrial customers who maybe unwilling to absorb the cost increases.
“If there is a pass through in the contract then there is no problem. In our case the contracts have provision for the additional cost to be passed on to the customer if there is a change of law”, said a senior
NHPC
official who did not wish to be identified.
Statkraft and LNJ Bhilwara Group have a
capital
commitment of around Rs. 1600 crore through the two hydro power JV’s that operate in Himachal Pradesh. Statkraft is the largest renewable energy company in Europe.

"Power Min asks states to withdraw any tax on generation of electricity, calls it illegal",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-min-asks-states-to-withdraw-any-tax-on-generation-of-electricity-calls-it-illegal/articleshow/99794769.cms,26-04-2023,"Ministry of Power
has asked states not to levy or impose tax or duty on generation of electricity especially from
hydro
projects for it being illegal and also exhorted them to withdraw any such levies promptly. ""It has come to the notice of Government of lndia (Gol) that some state governments have imposed taxes / duties on generation of electricity. This is illegal and unconstitutional,"" said a power ministry communique to chief secretaries of all states and
Union Territories
on Tuesday.
The ministry said any tax / duty on generation of electricity, which encompasses all types of generation viz. thermal, hydro, wind, solar, nuclear, etc. is illegal and unconstitutional.
In the light of constitutional provisions, the ministry stated that ""no taxes or duties may be levied by any state - under any guise on generation of electricity and if any taxes or duties have been so levied, it may be promptly withdrawn.""
The powers to levy taxes or duties are specifically stated in
List-II
of VII Schedule of the
Constitution
.
""No taxes / duties which have not been specifically mentioned in this list can be levied by state governments under any guise whatsoever - as residuary powers are with the central government,"" the ministry explained.
Live Events
Entry-53 of List-II (State List) authorizes states to put taxes on consumption or sale of electricity in its jurisdiction. This does not include the power to impose any tax or duty on the generation of electricity.
This is because electricity generated within the territory of one state may be consumed in other states and no state has the power to levy taxes or duties on residents of other states, the ministry pointed out.
Some states have imposed taxes or duties on generation of electricity under the guise of levying a cess on the use of water for generating electricity, the ministry noted.
However, though the state may call it a water cess, it is actually a tax on generation of electricity - the tax is to be collected from the consumers of electricity who may happen to be residents in other state.
Article 286 of the Constitution explicitly prohibits states from imposing any taxes or duties on supply of goods or services or on both where the supply takes place outside the state.
Articles 287 and 288 prohibit the imposition of taxes on consumption or sale of electricity consumed by the central government or sold to the central government for consumption by the government or its agencies.
As per Entry-56 of the
Union List of the Constitution, regulations
of issues related to
Inter-State Rivers
come under the purview of the Centre.
Most of the hydro-electric plants in states are located / proposed to be developed on Inter-State Rivers.
Any imposition of tax on the non-consumptive use of water of these rivers for electricity generation is in violation of provisions of the Constitution, it argued.
Hydro power projects do not consume water to produce electricity. Electricity is generated by directing the flow of water through a turbine which generates electricity - on the same principle as electricity from wind projects where wind is utilized to turn the turbine to produce electricity.
Therefore, the ministry said there is no rationale for levy of water cess or air cess.
The levy of water cess is against the provisions of the Constitution. List-II does not authorize states to levy any tax or duty on water.

Power Min revises framework to supply cheapest power lot first to consumers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/power-min-revises-framework-to-supply-cheapest-power-lot-first-to-consumers/articleshow/99791317.cms,26-04-2023,"The government has revised the framework for electricity supply to provide the cheapest power lot first to consumers and help state utilities to meet demand in a cost-effective manner. The power ministry has revised the structure of the Day-Ahead National level Merit Order Despatch Mechanism to lower the overall cost of electricity generation, which will translate into lower power prices for consumers, an official statement said Wednesday.
As per the revised mechanism, the cheapest generating resources (power) across the country will be despatched (supplied) first to meet the system demand.
The gains out of the proposed Day-Ahead National Merit Order Dispatch Mechanism would be shared between generating stations and their consumers.
This will result in increased annual savings for electricity consumers. The existing mechanism of merit order dispatch in real-time was made operational in April 2019. The mechanism optimised the total variable cost of generation pan-India while meeting technical and
grid security
constraints.
The existing mechanism resulted in a reduction of variable cost on a pan-India basis to the tune of Rs 2,300 crore and these benefits were being shared with generators and their beneficiaries, ultimately reducing the cost of electricity to consumers.

The revised mechanism will also enlarge the scope of the present system by including all the regional entity
thermal power plants
and subsequently all the intra-state
thermal generators
.
This will also help the states in maintaining resource adequacy in a cost-effective manner with less carbon footprints.
The Day-Ahead National Merit Order Dispatch Mechanism will be implemented by
CERC
through the necessary regulatory process and it will be operated by
GRID-INDIA
at the national level.
Since, 2014, the government has added 184.6 GW of additional generation capacity and 1,78,000 ckt km (circuit kilometres) of the transmission line to connect the whole country into one grid, which has transformed the whole country into one integrated electrical system.
The power ministry has been taking several measures to enhance the competition in the sector with the objective of lowering the cost of electricity to consumers.

Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission
(DERC), which has been directed to conduct a special
audit
of
power subsidy

for terms of reference and legal position of the exercise, official sources said on Tuesday. The
DERC
has received a communication from the government but there is no clarity on the objectives of the audit which need to be specified for a complete report, a source said.
""Also, there is some litigation involving audit of discoms which is still pending in the Supreme Court. It also needs to be checked that the special audit does not violate any instructions of the court,"" he said.
The special audit of
subsidy
through CAG-empanelled auditors, as directed by the government, will begin when there is clarity on these important points, the sources said.
The DERC is likely to communicate to the government for a detailed terms of reference of the audit exercise and seeking clarity on the legal position, they added.
Last week, an order was issued by the Power department of the
Delhi
government for audit, through the DERC, of subsidy amount of Rs 13,500 crore paid to the discoms between financial year 2016-17 and 2021-22.

Delhi Power Minister Atishi had said that the audit of power companies was taken up following the instructions of Chief Minister
Arvind
Kejriwal, after a file on the matter was approved by Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena. The file was sent to him on March 27.
The Kejriwal government was confident that the special audit would reveal if there were any irregularities and help improve
distribution
of electricity subsidies in Delhi, she had said.
""The objective of this special audit is to identify any irregularities in the distribution of electricity subsidies and ensure that residents of Delhi receive the benefits of the subsidy in a transparent and fair manner,"" the minister had said.
A tussle had been already brewing between the AAP dispensation and the LG office, with the former accusing the latter of ""conspiring"" with the BJP to stop power subsidy being provided in Delhi.
Saxena, in a letter to the chief minister recently, objected to allegations levelled against him by the AAP dispensation that he wanted to stop the government's power subsidy, and threatened legal action if adequate proof was not produced.

India’s Changemakers: KPMG ESG Conclave and Awards 2023,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-changemakers-kpmg-esg-conclave-and-awards-2023/articleshow/99762833.cms,26-04-2023,"Indian organisations are rewiring themselves to do business with sustainable practices in mind. In this changing environment, where every voice in the community needs to be heard, several ESG practices for companies will need to be thought of afresh so that the communities that they serve can be adequately taken care of. Some organisations have taken the first step of a journey that could be a thousand miles. Others are learning from the best practices of their peers. With the BRSR reporting regulation having kicked in, and other global reporting standards evolving at a rapid pace, there needs to be an urgency in aligning the ESG strategy and reporting for all organisations.
Excellence in ESG, guiding light for the future of India Inc.
Well before regulations kicked in, India’s leading companies had put in place a robust mechanism to monitor their ESG performance
Live Events
The first step in recognizing a fundamental change may appear to be routine. The import of such a recognition often takes time to be accepted for a wider audience.
It was one such evening in Mumbai when the KPMG ESG Conclave and Awards 2023 sought to recognise companies and their practices for raising the bar for ESG. Every trophy in the hands of the winners could tell the story of commitment of practices that are critical for businesses to thrive for communities. The first edition of the recognition programme had gotten underway several months earlier when data around the efforts of companies was collated. The theme of the event was Thought|Action|Impact.
As the names of the A-listers of corporate India for the awards were announced as the winners in their categories, the appreciation for their efforts were ringing loud among the audience. The hall was packed to the brim, one of the indicators that suggested the importance that India Inc is giving to sustainability.
The universe of listed companies was the focus for the year. Beginning April 1, 2023, SEBI has made it mandatory for India’s top 1000 companies to disclose non-financial data. The regulatory requirements are expected to expand during the coming years and companies will have to organise granular data so that they can stay ahead of the emerging regulation.
Panel -1:
India Inc needs sense of urgency on ESG
Addressing the ESG regulation is the first step that large companies must take to ensure they comply with the emerging laws. Large companies may not be content doing just that and would want their ESG strategy to stay ahead of regulation. The sense of urgency against the sustainability challenge should show in the action of companies, starting with an in-depth materiality assessment.
This is even more true for sectors that are hard to abate – cement, iron & steel, chemicals, and others – and industry and communities could well be running against time. The extreme weather conditions that have been seen is serving as a warning for perhaps the kind of decade this could be.
The carbon from the use of energy sources is one of the biggest cause for worry and the transition from the use of fossil fuel to moving towards electric mobility, for example, may need to be accelerated. While the thoughts and action are being seen, the impact needs to be seen in a timeline that is much shorter. If the leaders in the hard to abate sectors can show a turnaround, it could serve as a template for others in the sector and other industries to follow. Indian companies have raised sustainability linked bonds, while some sectors are raising finance for green transition. RBI’s recent guidelines has opened the market for green deposits. Along with the private sector, the government and multi-lateral agencies also need to come together in enabling this transition. “To bring about climate action, imbibing conscious choices in everyday life will likely be more impactful than what can be achieved simply with ESG through the boardroom. Even a small change can become significant enough to cause a larger critical change. Corporate leadership need to realise that,” OP Bhatt, Independent Director and former SBI Chairman said.
Panel 2:
Adding stakeholder voices as part of business operations
Every voice from the communities that are impacted by the operation of businesses needs to be heard. That is turning out to be the rule for businesses as they evolve in the new millennium. The expectations that stakeholders have from business is expanding and the emerging regulation is making it imperative for businesses to have one ear to the ground. This shift away from traditional shareholder-centric models of capitalism has created a whole new set of corporate obligations, with businesses now needing to actively demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and social justice. Companies are today being held to higher ethical standards, exemplified by CSR initiatives. As millennials continue to embrace stakeholder capitalism, businesses will be forced to rapidly adapt. The sweeping changes being seen in the way companies make their mandatory disclosures are being impacted in a big way due to the regulations. Some changes could also be happening due to the expected regulatory landscape. The suppliers of all these companies will also have to face a new environment due to the unfolding changes. “We have seen massive change including in India in the last five years. Some of these drivers might be regulations in the pipeline, especially in India, we saw a great push of the BRSR regulation that is coming for the top 1000 largest companies. They are preparing for the disclosure ahead of that. So, there is a massive move of the large companies to be comparable to their global peers,” Robert Dornau, Global Head of Corporate Engagement, S & P Global said.
Rigorous jury process
The multi-stage evaluation process was anything but easy as it tried to identify the best among the best. The jury evaluation process considered policy frameworks, materiality considerations, best practices, nature of initiatives, public disclosures, performance across various indicators and others helped sift through the work being done by companies.
After the sourcing of preliminary data had been completed, recognising the best practices among companies required a team to look at 52 companies in greater detail. What followed was reviewing 114 reports – integrated reports, sustainability reports and more. After spending over 4000 hours and putting together some 15,000 data points collated in nearly 1500 pages, some 300 documents were compiled for the jury to consider.
The jury was now ready to go ahead with the herculean task. With online and offline meetings among the jury members, all relevant data points were pored through culminating into two days of jury deliberations. As they debated on the various considerations, it helped the jury members to narrow down on the winners across the seven sectors.
Challenge for next year
The challenge for the next year will be to expand the list of companies to identify more changemakers and companies that are doing the grunt work. Companies that are putting together the building blocks for holistic ESG transformation, banking and finance companies that are expanding their sustainability finance business, changes happening in the value chain, and more could be possible areas to look at. Regulation is expected to evolve further, as more and more companies could be expected to report their non-financial data. Investors could demand greater transparency and reporting because of the risks due to non-compliance to the capital, operations and overall conduct of the business. As companies enhance the quality and transparency of their ESG reporting, an integrated view towards reporting could emerge, where both financial and non-financial data is disclosed holistically.
The recognition is expected to goad more companies into action and, collectively, India Inc could make the change towards meeting India’s sustainable development goals (SDG) by 2030. India Inc must also align its actions to the national commitment made for the country to achieve net zero by 2070. The target year may look too far off but every small step towards the goal will count.
The trophies and the citation that the winners carried for the evening will have pride of place in their offices. The importance of being the first winners of the prestigious awards, that could define a new way of doing business, could dawn on the companies in times to come.

Rain cools down demand for power; coal stocks higher,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/rain-cools-down-demand-for-power-coal-stocks-higher/articleshow/99740936.cms,25-04-2023,"The recent wet spells and comparatively cooler patches in April in north
India
, led to lower-than-expected
power
demand on average. This lowered the fuel depletion rate at coal-based power plants, bringing much-needed relief to the stressed supply chain.
Coal stock with power plants at the beginning of April was 36.9 million metric tonnes, including import, which fell to 35.8 million tonnes as on April 22. The depletion would have been higher if the weather hadn't turned cooler, said two senior government officials.
Coal consumption last year between April 1 and April 24 was 3.6 million tonnes with closing stock at 21.8 million tonnes. After a cool beginning, the temperature soared for around 10 days till April 20 with the peak demand nearing a record which increased coal consumption. Temperature is expected to remain moderate for the rest of the month this year.
Peak demand touched a record of 215.9 GW on April 17, coal consumption shot up and stock at power plants started reducing compared with an increase in the first week of April. It was anticipated that the demand would continue to increase.

The
power ministry
had earlier said it expects a peak demand of 231 GW in April. However, with the weather getting cooler, power demand dropped with peak demand at 184 GW as of April 23.
On Monday, the price at the day-ahead market of
Indian Energy Exchange
was at ₹5 per unit compared with ₹7.1 per unit as of April 21. Prices hovered between ₹3.5 and ₹4.7 a unit in the first seven days of the month due to favourable weather conditions.

Hydro power firms could take financial hit due to new levy by Himachal Pradesh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/hydro-power-firms-could-take-financial-hit-due-to-new-levy-by-himachal-pradesh/articleshow/99656383.cms,21-04-2023,"Hydropower companies face the prospects of a dent to their financials due to the new water usage cess imposed by the
Himachal Pradesh
government in March, multiple industry executives and experts ET spoke with said.
JSW
,
GMR
,
Statkraft
and
Greenko
are among private sector players likely to be affected. A total of 172 projects in the state have to pay for the water that flows through their plants to generate electricity.
According to industry insiders, the impact is expected to be two-pronged. Functional projects are expected to see a sharp rise in operating costs - by up to 25%. Under-construction projects will have to renegotiate terms with bankers for financing because the underlying financial projections on the basis of which those loans were granted have changed.
None of the potentially affected companies responded to ET’s mailed queries until the publication of this report.
“In some cases, power purchase agreements may factor in changes of law clauses. In those cases, the additional cost of generation will be passed on to the distributor and ultimately make power expensive for the end-user,” a top executive at one of the affected companies said, on the condition of anonymity. “However, where the contracts don’t have such protective clauses, the financial impact could make the project unviable”, a top executive at one of the impacted companies said on condition of anonymity.
Live Events
According to banking sources, GMR’s 180-megawatt project at Bajoli Holi in Himachal Pradesh sells power to industrial customers such as UP Power Corporation and Delhi International Airport. There are no clauses for change in law events in its contracts and it would be unable to re-negotiate tariffs and pass on additional costs.
Similarly, sources said that Statkraft’s project at Malana in Himachal Pradesh operates on a merchant power contract with
PTC India
. There is no room for re-negotiating tariffs. The company has two other projects in the state with capacities of around 150 megawatts and 192 megawatts. They are also likely to be affected.
Greenko and JSW Group have under-construction projects with capacities of around 500 megawatts and 240 megawatts, respectively. Financing terms on those under-construction projects could be affected because the cost structure has changed.
“They should not have imposed the water usage cess. They are already charging generators by making them provide 12% of power generated by them free to the state. In addition, they are levying 1% as local area development charges,” said MM Madan, Jindal Steel’s former hydropower chief.
Hydropower experts believe the policy change is expected to impact investor appetite in the sector.
“The viability will be reduced. Therefore, investments will reduce,” said Awadh Giri, head of Confederation of Indian Industry’s hydropower committee.

Efficiency can overcome the energy challenge – Why India needs to act now,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/efficiency-can-overcome-the-energy-challenge-why-india-needs-to-act-now/articleshow/99643135.cms,25-10-2023,"Amidst rising energy costs, and a growing population that is consuming more and more energy, energy efficiency has come forth as one of the key solutions for answering the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions. Machineries that can perform better with less power are therefore crucial to overcoming today’s greatest challenges.
To understand how organisations are approaching energy efficiency, ABB recently conducted a survey of 250 of India’s leading industrial and commercial decision-makers. The same survey was also conducted in other countries, including the US, China, and Brazil. Data from all 2,300 global decision-makers has been compiled in the
ABB Energy Insights Survey Report 2023.
The conclusions of this research could possibly set off alarm bells for business leaders and policymakers. However, the good news is that practical solutions to increase energy efficiency are now easily available, more accessible and affordable. Here is what Indian businesses need to know.
Concerns regarding energy crisis
Energy is the top operating expense for many industrial businesses and a significant expense for several other kinds of businesses. On average, it represents 34 per cent of a business’s operating costs – and for a quarter of businesses (26 percent), it accounts for more than half of their operating cost.
82 percent of Indian decision-makers consider rising energy costs to be ‘major’ or ‘moderate’ threat to their business profitability. As compared to the global average, businesses in India are slightly more concerned about the energy crisis with 74 per cent business leaders considering it a threat to profitability.
Nine in ten Indian business leaders (92.2 per cent) are also concerned about the availability, reliability and security of the energy supply. The most common concerns are further price increases (42 per cent), power cuts or blackouts (40 per cent), and energy rationing or supply interruptions (34 per cent).

Business consequences of high energy prices
In turn, business leaders expect rising energy costs to affect other areas of business, with potential. Many plan to reduce spending elsewhere (39 per cent) or cut production (31 per cent), while over a third (36 per cent) expect to pass price rises on to the consumer. Around a quarter are also considering delaying the launch of new products or services (25 per cent) or moving production to a country with cheaper energy (24 per cent).
If energy prices remain high over the next three to five years, businesses expect to reduce spending on other essential areas. Cuts will include recruitment (42 per cent); salaries, overtime and bonuses (38 per cent); training (37 per cent); and research and development (22 per cent).
Delaying our most urgent priority
There is another significant ripple effect we cannot afford: a delay in sustainability and carbon neutrality plans. Six in ten (58 per cent) expressed that rising energy costs will delay them from meeting their emissions goals by one to five years.
Every part of society must play its role in achieving Net Zero emissions, but industrial businesses must take the lead. Globally, industry accounts for more than half of total greenhouse gas emissions. The scale of the sector means that even small changes made by industry, therefore, can have a huge collective impact. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), however, the industry is already ‘not on track’ to achieve Net Zero, so further delays are unacceptable.
Energy efficiency: the ‘first fuel’
Clearly, the energy crisis has significant consequences in terms of competitiveness, growth, employment, and sustainability. As a result, businesses are looking to energy efficiency to enable them to use energy more effectively. Almost half of the decision-makers (49 per cent) have increased investment in improving energy efficiency, and more than one in four (28 per cent) have undertaken an efficiency audit.
Industrial businesses, for example, can benefit greatly from upgrading equipment such as electric motors. Globally, industrial electric motors consume 45 per cent of all power produced. Replacing a 20-year-old motor with a modern solution reduces its energy consumption by up to 30 percent.
Upgrading to equipment with best-in-class energy efficiency has clear business benefits. Considering the motor example, today’s energy prices mean that the payback period is under 18 months. Further, most of a motor’s total cost of ownership (TCO) goes toward the power to operate it throughout its lifetime. This means that continuing to use old, less efficient motors rather than paying the upfront cost of a new model is ‘penny wise, pound foolish.’
Efficiency is also better for the planet. Using less energy to achieve a task reduces the emissions associated with it. If every industrial electric motor-driven system worldwide was replaced with optimised, high-efficiency equipment, global energy consumption would drop by 10 percent. This is why the IEA calls efficiency the ‘first fuel’ in reducing emissions.
Join the movement
In 2021, ABB launched the
Energy Efficiency Movement.
This forum of more than 320 businesses from around the world, including over 120 from India, supports research, shares innovations, and leads by example on energy efficiency.
Organisations of all kinds – including industry, academia, and the public sector – are encouraged to join the movement. All they need to do is commit to reducing their energy usage, CO2 emissions, or both. Together, we can create a more energy-efficient, sustainable and prosperous world.

Modi adviser says India will push back on West monpoly over ESG aims,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/modi-adviser-says-india-will-push-back-on-west-monpoly-over-esg-aims/articleshow/99554348.cms,17-04-2023,"India needs to resist efforts by some western ratings companies to push
ESG
norms on emerging markets even as Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
’s government is committed to zero out green house gas emissions by 2070, a key economic adviser said.
“The issue is not so much about the need for some norms, but about who will be monitoring these targets,” Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of Modi’s economic advisory council said in an interview. “The existing credit rating ones already have serious biases and failures. Allowing the emergence of a new bunch of exclusively western agencies to monitor ESG targets is problematic.”
India has been championing the issues important to emerging economies as it hosts the Group of 20 nations this year. In the first meeting of finance ministers and
central bank
heads in February, New Delhi took up the cause of debt relief for poorer nations, reforms in multilateral institutions and climate financing.
The South Asian nation needs to seek a review of the methodologies that international think tanks and global credit rating agencies employ, Sanyal said.
There have been concerns about how global rating agencies view India. Do you think there needs to be an overhaul of their systems?

There are a tiny group of international think tanks and agencies that effectively de-construct other countries and pass judgments on them. Sometimes it is done on opinion-based issues like democracy and academic freedom, and sometimes they do it based supposedly on hard data. In both cases there are serious problems.
Yet, these indices are taken reasonably seriously, and indirectly find their way into concrete things such as sovereign ratings. In the past, the thinking is to ignore them since they are biased. We cannot ignore them, in my view, because they have impact on real world decision-making. Therefore, we need to look into their methodology.
Is there a plan to raise the issue in G-20 deliberations?
The issue is not so much about the need for some norms, but about who will be monitoring these targets. The existing credit rating ones already have serious biases and failures. Allowing the emergence of a new bunch of exclusively western agencies to monitor ESG targets is problematic.
Moreover, there is a danger that the norms and their application will be decided by a small clique of western agencies. This is a form of neo-colonialism. We need to push back against it, whether on G-20 or any other platform.
Which focus areas could help India reach net zero by 2070 and reduce emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030?
We want to certainly transition away from
hydrocarbons
. We must remember in India’s case we are not a country blessed with large amounts of fossil fuels, but we are blessed with sunshine. We are a technology capable country that can take advantage of various types of renewables, including nuclear power and solar. So, there is no conflict of interest for India in transitioning to other forms of energy production and storage.
As for the 2070 net zero target, as fast as we can do it without compromising on energy security and stability of supply, we will do it.

India power giant to add more coal plants to meet soaring demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-power-giant-to-add-more-coal-plants-to-meet-soaring-demand/articleshow/99485739.cms,14-04-2023,"State-run
NTPC Ltd
., India’s largest electricity producer, plans to start building more coal plants this year as the country continues to lean on the fuel to meet its growing energy needs.
New Delhi-based
NTPC
will likely award construction orders for about 4.5 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity during the fiscal year that began this month, according to an official aware of the plans, who asked not be named before a final decision is made. The projects will be built across three sites where the utility already runs power plants.
The projects underscore how even as India sets ambitious long-term decarbonization targets, in the near term it will continue to rely on the dirtiest fossil fuel to meet rapidly growing power demand. A warming planet and increased penetration of air conditioners are causing power consumption to climb to new records in the country.
NTPC, which last year began building coal plants again after a years-long hiatus, expects to place orders for construction of 1.6 gigawatts of
coal power plants
each at Lara and Singrauli, as well a 1.32 gigawatts at Meja in Uttar Pradesh during the current fiscal year, the official said.
The company, India’s largest coal user, aims to boost output from its own mines to 34 million tons this fiscal year, a 48% increase from the previous year, according to the official.

At the same time, the company is laying the groundwork for adding more carbon-free energy. At Pudimadaka, a coastal site in the state of Andhra Pradesh that was once meant to be home to a 4 gigawatt coal power plant, the company is now planning a green hydrogen hub with renewable generation, electrolyzer manufacturing, and green hydrogen and ammonia production, according to the official.
The company also plans to sell a stake this year in its clean energy unit,

Arunachal government quietly upgrades Kaho project to 100 kw,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/arunachal-government-building-50-mini-hydropower-projects-along-china-border/articleshow/99455984.cms,13-04-2023,"The Arunachal administration has quietly upgraded an existing micro hydel project near the
Line of Actual Control
(LAC) despite protests from China’s People’s Liberation Army (
PLA
), ET has learnt. India and China share 3,488 km of borders, of which 1,126 km is in Arunachal Pradesh.
China continues to raise objections on infrastructure projects while it has ramped up infrastructure, including roads and buildings, on their side, said officials. The lack of basic facilities has forced the population living in these remote areas to migrate from border villages to the foothills. One of the villages located on the India-China border, Kaho, had an existing 50 kw hydel project but it was unable to fulfil the electricity requirements of the villagers and the border guarding forces (BGFs). “BGFs are dependent on diesel generators for
power
which is not only costly but also polluting,” said Arunachal deputy CM Chowna Mein. According to the state officials,
Chinese PLA had raised objection to any kind of construction activity close to the border following which the authorities reached out to the
Indian Army
and after negotiations, it was agreed that the hydel plant could be repaired. However, the authorities quietly upgraded the power plant from 50 kw to 100 kw. “The work was completed in seven months at an estimated cost of Rs 308.49 lakh,” said Dharmendra Gogoi, the executive engineer who oversaw the work.
It is expected to improve power supply to four villages in the locality, he added. “Lack of reliable power supplies due to limitations in providing grid connectivity to these remote areas is a huge constraint for the civilians,” added another official. Union home minister Amit Shah, during his visit to Kibithoo early this week, inaugurated 17 of these projects including the one made operational in neighbouring Kaho. The total capacity of these 17 projects is 1,255 kw and was constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 50.045 crore, added officials.
The Centre has allocated Rs 4,800 crore, including Rs2,500 crore exclusively for road connectivity, for 2022-23 to 2025-26. The vibrant village programme is a centrally-sponsored scheme, under which 2,967 villages in 46 blocks of 19 districts abutting the northern border in Arunachal, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal and Ladakh have been identified for comprehensive development. In the first phase, 662 villages have been identified for priority coverage, which includes 455 villages in Arunachal Pradesh.

PFC-REC's winning offer for Lanco unit runs into regulatory hurdles,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/pfc-recs-winning-offer-for-lanco-unit-runs-into-regulatory-hurdles/articleshow/99443936.cms,13-04-2023,"Power Finance Corp
(
PFC
) and
REC
's joint bid to buy stressed
Lanco Amarkantak Power
has run into likely regulatory hurdles after the department of investment and public asset management, or Dipam, questioned the transaction structure the two state-run companies want to use to complete the deal, sources told ET. The PFC-REC duo had outbid the Adani Group and
Reliance Industries
in the race to buy the distressed power plant.
Dipam, which is in charge of state invested assets, is not comfortable with PFC and REC acquiring the power project through a joint venture (JV) company they created last year specifically for the purpose of acquiring stressed power plants.
According to sources in the know, Dipam is not in-principle opposed to the acquisition of stressed power projects by the PFC-REC combine, but it has reservations about this being done through a separate company that would require fresh capital to be allocated for a defined purpose.
However, it may still approve the transaction being undertaken by the duo by recommending tweaks in the structure, sources said.
The government department under whose supervision all public sector enterprises fall has the ultimate veto in decisions of strategic importance taken by state-owned companies.

Emailed queries sent to Dipam's secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey remained unanswered.
Lanco
Amarkantak Power's resolution professional Saurabh Tikmani was unavailable for comments. PFC and REC did not respond to queries.
Lanco Amarkantak Power was admitted for insolvency proceedings in September 2019.
The PFC-REC combine had offered ₹3,020 crore for Lanco Amarkantak Power after a Swiss challenge mechanism was introduced in the bidding process that had attracted both Reliance Industries and the Adani Group. A Swiss challenge involves using the highest offer as a base price and inviting bidders to better that offer.
In this case, Adani's offer of ₹3,000 crore was used as a base price for the challenge. Eventually, neither Adani nor
RIL
participated in the Swiss challenge, leaving PFC-REC as the winning bidder.
PFC and REC had set up a joint venture (JV) company in August to acquire stressed power plants undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. Their objective was to acquire those plants where they felt the bidders were offering very low value. The two public sector companies are big lenders to the power sector and have loaned money to some of the largest power projects in the country. The recovery of dues from stressed projects directly affects the performance of their mainstay business which is lending.
The plan was to bring under the JV company, stressed power plants like KSK Mahanadi Power which has Rs. 30,000 crore of debt and Lanco Amarkantak Power which has Rs. 14,000 crore of debt. The company would create sub-verticals or special purpose vehicles in which the projects would be lodged and resurrected financially till they become viable and can be ultimately sold for the right price.
According to sources, PFC and REC bid for Lanco Amarkantak Power because they have given large loans to the power company and felt that the value offered by bidders was not adequate. After being declared the winning bidder, they approached DIPAM for approval to acquire the company through the JV entity.

projects.
Currently, green hydrogen and ammonia manufacturing projects commissioned before July 2025 are eligible for this benefit. This is proposed to be extended to all projects commissioned up to December 2030. This would make more projects eligible for the incentive.
""Waiver of ISTS charges could significantly improve the economic viability for plants for production of green hydrogen and its derivatives,"" according to the proposal from the ministry of new and renewable energy.
The exemption from the charges is proposed to remain for 25 years after the commencement of operations.
India aims to be a global manufacturing hub of green hydrogen and green ammonia producing them at the lowest cost.

The extension has been proposed keeping in mind the construction period of ""large-scale"" green ammonia plants, which is likely to be around 30-36 months.
""It is unlikely that substantial capacity of the project is likely to get commissioned by the cut-off date of 30 June 2025,"" said a person aware of the details.
Almost 65-70% of the production cost of these two fuels - green hydrogen and green ammonia - is renewable energy. While the plants producing these two fuels are likely to be located near export hubs, renewable energy used may come from far away locations.
This would require renewable energy to be transmitted to the manufacturing hubs, which generally costs around ₹1-2 per unit, depending on the location, increasing production costs.
Waiving transmission costs will make production competitive. The National Green Hydrogen Mission has laid out a target of at least 5 million metric tonnes per year capacity by 2030 and details the steps for demand creation, production, utilization, and export. The first tranche of the auction for government incentives to make green hydrogen will take place in the ongoing quarter. The government has imposed a ₹50 per kg incentive cap for the first year of production.
While hydrogen is a ready fuel, green ammonia can be used to store hydrogen and transported to energy deficit areas for extraction and use.

Discom debt surges 24% to Rs 6.2 lakh crore in 2021-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/discom-debt-surges-24-to-rs-6-2-lakh-crore-in-2021-22/articleshow/99388414.cms,11-04-2023,"The total
debt
of the power distribution sector in
India
rose to ₹6.20 lakh crore in 2021-22, up 24% from 2019-20. However, the pace of debt addition slowed down over the two years, said an annual report on the sector from
Power Finance Corporation Ltd.
The sector's debt rose ₹33,800 crore in 2021-22, 60% less than the ₹85,500-crore increase in the previous financial year, the report said.
The sector's financial deficit nearly halved in 2021-22 from 2019-20, following
tariff
increases,
loan
takeover by state governments, and improvement in
subsidy
disbursement and bill collections.
Financial deficit is an important indicator of the financial health of the sector. The report calculated the deficit on a cash-adjusted basis, where the focus was on capturing cash flows instead of
revenue
accrued. It compared 2021-22 performance with the previous two fiscals due to the impact of Covid-19.

pumped storage projects
in the country as they are
non-polluting
and more environmentally friendly. The guidelines have been finalised after receiving suggestions from stakeholders, according to a power ministry notification.
As per the guidelines, state governments may allot project sites to developers through various ways, including competitive bidding, tariff-based competitive bidding process and on nomination basis to CPSUs and state PSUs.
The ministry said that Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) provide the necessary scale of storage and have a long service life of more than 40-50 years, and results in a low cost of delivered energy over the life of the projects.
""PSPs are also non-polluting and are more environmentally friendly'... PSPs account for over 95 per cent of installed global energy storage capacity.
""lt is estimated that pumped
hydro projects
worldwide store up to 9,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity worldwide,"" it said.

Developers shall start construction work within a period of two years from the date of allotment of the project, failing which allotment of the project site shall be cancelled by the state.
However, a one-year relaxation may be granted on a conditional basis, the notification said, adding that no upfront premium will be charged for project allocation.
States may exempt land to be acquired by off-the-river PSPs from payment towards stamp duty and registration fees. Government land, if available, may be provided at a concessional rate to the developers on an annual lease rent basis, it added.
""PSPs may be supported through concessional climate finance. Sovereign green bonds issued for mobilising resources for green infrastructure as a part of the government's overall market borrowings may be deployed in the development of PSPs which utilise renewable energy for charging,"" it said.

As per the bid documents, NVVN will buy the power from the selected bidder from April 10 to May 16, 2023. The company will sell the power in the spot markets to increase power availability. The under-recovery will be bridged by the
federal power ministry through its
Power System Development Fund (PSDF). India expects its maximum demand to peak at 230-gigawatts this year and is taking various measures to avert power cuts. The government has brought forward maintenance at some coal-fired power plants and secured extra NTPC gas-fired capacity. However, about 24-gigawatts of its gas-based power generation capacity remains underutilised due to a lack of fuel.

Adani Power begins power supply to Bangladesh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-begins-power-supply-to-bangladesh/articleshow/99358671.cms,09-04-2023,"Adani Power Limited (APL), the largest private thermal power producer in India, has commissioned its first 800 MW ultra-super-critical thermal power generation unit at Godda in the
Jharkhand
district and begun supplying 748 MW of power to neighbouring
Bangladesh
, the company said today.
“The Godda power plant is a strategic asset in the India-Bangladesh’s long-standing relationship,” said SB Khyalia, CEO, Adani Power Limited, adding that the power plant will ease power supply in Bangladesh, making its industries and ecosystem more competitive.
""It is going to be the most efficient and environment-friendly thermal power plant installed in India and the entire South-East region and also one of the best in class in the world,"" he said.
The Godda Power Plant comprises two units of the latest technology available in the world, which is ultra super critical technology with latest techniques for controlling emissions and consumption of coal and water.
The company added that it is the first power plant in the country, which has started its operations with 100% flue gas desulphurization (FGD), selective catalytic reduction (
SCR
) and zero water discharge.
Live Events
The FGD and SCR have been installed in the plant to minimise the emission and meet the latest environment norms of the
ministry of environment
, forest and climate change.
In November 2017, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) executed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with APL’s wholly-owned subsidiary Adani Power Jharkhand Limited (APJL) to procure 1,496 MW net capacity power from 2X800 MW ultra-supercritical power project at Godda. India’s largest power producer in the private sector is expected to commission its second 800 MW unit soon.
Bangladesh has one of the largest liquid fuel-based power generation plants in the Indian sub-continent region. The installed capacity of heavy fuel oil (HFO)-based plants is about 6,329 MW and high-speed diesel (HSD)-based plants is about 1,290 MW, totaling to over 7,600 MW.
As per BPDB’s annual report for the financial year 2021-22, the total tariff of HFO-based plants is around Bangladeshi Taka 22.10/kWh and total tariff of HSD-based power plants is around Bangladeshi Taka 154.11/kWh, which is far higher than the tariff of Godda Power Plant (Energy cost estimated to be around 9 cents/KWh). Though at present, Bangladesh has long-term PPA ties with three other imported coal-based generators, total tariff of Godda TPP is competitive compared to peers, the company said.
APJL had synchronised the first unit with the power grid of Bangladesh on 29 November 2022 through a dedicated transmission line from Godda to Bangladesh.
Subsequently, the requisite transmission evacuation system on the Bangladesh side was commissioned in March 2023. Accordingly, APJL again synchronised unit 1 on 20 March 2023. The
Reliability Run Test
, including Commercial Operation Tests, was completed on 5 April 2023 in the presence of authorities from BPDB and
Power Grid Corporation of Bangladesh
(
PGCB
) officials.
Adani Power has an installed thermal power capacity of 13,610 MW spread across seven power plants in Gujarat, Maharashtra,
Karnataka
, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and
Madhya Pradesh
, apart from a 40 MW solar power plant in Gujarat.

have reduced to Rs 91,061 crore in March,
Parliament
was informed on Thursday. The outstanding dues which were at Rs 1,38,378 crore earlier declined to Rs 91,061 crore as on March 28, 2023, Union Minister for Power, New and Renewable Energy R. K. Singh said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.
He further said that the government promulgated Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules 2022 on June 3, 2022, recognizing the cash flow problems arising out of outstanding receivables of gencos from the discoms and in order to increase basic payment discipline in the power sector value chain.
These rules entail obligations upon the discoms to clear their legacy or outstanding dues as existing on June 3, 2022 in a time bound and phased manner in equated monthly installments with benefits of non-applicability of late payment surcharge after June 3 of 2022, he said.
In a separate reply to the Lower House, Singh said there are several power plants designed for using high calorific value
imported coal
. Therefore, the imports of coal for power generation cannot be reduced to zero.
Cement, Sponge Iron, and Aluminium industries utilize high calorific value low ash imported coal. The coal requirement for such a category of consumers cannot be substituted by
domestic coal
, he said.

""With the increase in
electricity demand
, the supply of coal to the power plants is not commensurate with the domestic coal requirement. The gap between daily coal consumption and daily arrival of domestic coal ranged from 2.65 lakh tonne (LT) to 0.5 LT between the months of September 2022 and January 2023,"" Singh said.
The minister explained that without imports of coal for blending, the coal stocks at thermal power plants would have reduced to zero in September 2022, leading to widespread power cuts and blackouts.
Therefore, Ministry of Power advised Central, State Gencos and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) on January 9, 2023, to import coal through a transparent competitive procurement for blending so as to have sufficient coal stocks at their power plants for smooth operations till September 2023.
The minister also informed the house that a number of steps have been taken by the government to remove the logistical constraints in the coal supply chain and ensure availability of coal in power plants.
Besides setting up an Inter-Ministerial Sub Group and a Secretary level Inter Ministerial Committee (IMC), the government has directed central, state gencos and independent power producers (IPPs) to take necessary action and plan to import coal through a transparent competitive procurement for blending at the rate of 6 per cent by weight so as to have coal stocks at their power plants for smooth operations till September 2023, he said.
In another reply, Singh said around 27,000 circuit kilometres of transmission lines will be added at an investment of Rs. 75,000 crores by 2024-25 under the Prime Minister's
Gati
Shakti Master Plan.
""The capacity of National Grid is being expanded on a continuous basis to commensurate with the growth in electricity generation and electricity demand. As on 28-02-2023, Indian Transmission network includes 4,68,977 ckm of transmission lines (220kV and above voltage level) and 11,58,875 MVA of the transformation capacity in substations (220kV and above voltage level). The inter-regional capacity of the National Grid is 1,12,250 MW,"" the minister said.

power
and have not cleared
subsidy
dues on electricity tariff, according to an official order. The
Ministry of Power
in an office order also stated that the power from the central pool will not be allocated to those states which have regulatory assets.
Regulatory assets come into existence when power regulators acknowledge that the tariffs imposed on electricity consumers do not adequately cover the power purchase costs of
distribution
companies (discoms).
Certain aspects will be examined whenever a request will be received from any state/union territory (UT) for allocation of power from the unallocated quota of
Central Generating Stations
, the order dated March 31, 2023, said.
The ministry will take into account non-creation of regulatory assets and timely
payment
of subsidy declared, if any, in the consumer tariffs by the state
government
to distribution utilities.
Lastly, whether any tax/cess has been imposed by the state concerned particularly on hydro-power or on renewable energy projects which have the potential to obstruct the inter-state flow of electricity, it said adding ""allocation of power to a state/UT would be strongly disincentivised if it is found violative in any of the above criteria.""

Jitendra Singh
said in response to a question from
BSP
member
Malook Nagar
who sought to know whether the government proposes to completely stop the use of nuclear energy in future and develop conventional energy sources in a phased manner.
In a written reply to a separate question, Singh said the government has accorded administrative approval and financial sanction for 10 indigenous
Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors
of 700 MW each in fleet mode.
Two 700 MW reactors each are being built at Kaiga in Karnataka,
Gorakhpur

"India's power output grows at fastest pace in 33 years, fuelled by coal",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-power-output-grows-at-fastest-pace-in-33-years-fuelled-by-coal/articleshow/99261699.cms,05-04-2023,"India
's power generation grew at the fastest pace in over three decades in the just-ended fiscal year, a Reuters analysis of government data showed, fuelling a sharp surge in emissions as output from both coal-fired and renewable plants hit records.
Intense summer heatwaves, a colder-than-usual winter in northern India and an economic recovery led to a jump in electricity demand, forcing India to crank up output from coal plants and solar farms as it scrambled to avoid power cuts.
Power generation rose 11.5% to 1,591.11 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh), or units, in the fiscal year ended March 2023, an analysis of daily load data from regulator
Grid-India
showed, the sharpest increase since year ended March 1990.
Output from plants running on fossil fuels rose 11.2%, the quickest growth in over three decades, thanks to a 12.4% surge in electricity production from coal, the analysis showed, offsetting a 28.7% decline in generation from cleaner gas-fired plants as a global spike in
LNG
prices deterred usage.
In the new fiscal year that began April 1, Indian power plants are expected to burn about 8% more coal.
Live Events
The rapid acceleration in India's coal-fired output to address a spike in power demand underscores challenges faced by the world's third largest greenhouse gas-emitter in weaning its economy off carbon, as it attempts to ensure energy security to around 1.4 billion Indians.
Total power supplied during the last fiscal year was 1509.15 billion kWh, 8.4% higher than a year earlier but still 6.69 billion units short of demand, the widest deficit in six years.
Electricity generated from coal rose to 1,162.91 billion kWh, the data showed, with its share in overall output rising to 73.1% - the highest level since the year ending March 2019.
India's Central Electricity authority estimates that 1 million kWh of power produced from coal generates 975 tonnes of carbon dioxide, while the same amount of power generated from gas produces 475 tonnes. A plant fired by lignite, known as brown coal, emits 1,280 tonnes to produce equivalent power.
RENEWABLES PUSH
Increased fossil fuel burning for power in the world's fifth largest economy drove up CO2 emissions during the year by nearly a sixth, to 1.15 billion tonnes, Reuters calculations based on government data and emissions estimates show.
That is 3.4% of the
International Energy Agency
's estimate of annual global emissions of 33.8 billion tonnes in 2022.
Many major countries boosted coal use in the twelve months due to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine
, but the rise was steepest in India, data from energy think-tank
Ember
shows.
The government has defended India's high coal use citing lower per capita emissions compared with richer nations and rising renewable energy output.
After missing a target to install 175 GW in renewable energy capacity by 2022, India is trying to boost non-fossil capacity - solar and wind energy, nuclear and hydro power, and bio-power - to 500 GW by 2030.
India's solar capacity additions have risen by about a fifth during the just-ended fiscal year, boosting its renewable energy output by a record 33.3 billion units, or 21.7%, to 187.1 billion units.
The green energy output helped prevent as much as 32.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions from power that would otherwise likely have been produced with coal, calculations show.
The share of renewables in power generation, excluding big hydro and nuclear power, rose to 11.8% in 2022/23, compared with 10.8% the previous year, the data showed, driven mainly by a 35% increase in solar output.

said in a press conference. The people of Delhi will continue to get free electricity on monthly consumption of 200 units. Those using 201-400 units will get a 50 per cent subsidy.
Applications received for power subsidy from October till now will be considered valid till April 2024, said the minister.
""The decision comes despite efforts by the
BJP
and the Lieutenant Governor to stop the scheme,"" said the minister, who had earlier claimed that attempts were being made to stop free electricity provided by the
Kejriwal
government to the farmers and lawyers.
In the wake of her allegations, the BJP had accused her of lying that farmers were getting free power supply and claimed they were receiving bills of thousands of rupees due to fixed charges.
In a statement, Delhi Chief Minister
Arvind
Kejriwal thanked the people of Delhi for their support and assured them that as long as he is there, they will face ""no problems.""

The free electricity scheme was introduced by the Kejriwal government in 2019.
Atishi said that a file on power subsidy was yet not officially produced before the Delhi government, and claimed that the power department officials said they were under ""pressure"" to stop the free electricity scheme.
The Power Minister said that when the
Cabinet
note was to be readied, like every year, for the electricity subsidy scheme to be continued, the officers of the Power department were forcibly called to the LG Office, where senior leaders of the BJP were also present.
""...they all threatened the officers and got them to write a note on the files saying that the subsidy given to lawyers and farmers should be ended,"" Atishi said.
More than 48 lakh domestic consumers, out of more than 58 lakh, have opted for subsidy as per official figures.
Kejriwal had last year announced that subsidies will be given to only those consumers who will apply for it.

India looking to merge hydro power units to create single company: Power minister,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-looking-to-merge-hydro-power-units-to-create-single-company-power-minister/articleshow/99217509.cms,03-04-2023,"The government is considering selling state-owned
NTPC
Ltd's two
hydro power
firms to
NHPC Ltd
to create a single hydro power company that would improve efficiency and cut costs, power minister
R K Singh
told Reuters.
One large hydro power company would help meet high demand at night when solar projects do not run, he said. Solar power projects meet nearly a-fifth of India's peak-hour energy demand during the day.
""We have a number of hydro PSUs (Public Sector Undertakings). We are thinking whether these hydro companies can come together as a hydro large PSU. Then it becomes a specialised hydro company,"" Power and Renewable Energy Minister Singh said in an interview on Monday.
NTPC, the country's largest power producer, acquired the two hydro companies -- THDC India Ltd (THDCIL) and NEEPCO -- three years ago for about $1.34 billion under a consolidation plan by the Indian government.
The power ministry's proposal to create a single company is aimed at better management and expertise, besides reducing costs and managing related challenges.

Hydropower plants in India take decades to come on stream as they face opposition from environment and religious groups.
Hydro power's share of India's energy has fallen to 11% from 49% 15 years ago due in part to protests by different groups and land clearances.
The combined entity after the merger of THDCIL and NEEPCO with
NHPC
would have 20 GW of hydro assets. NHPC, which is also state-owned, currently has 12 GW of hydro assets.
The minister did not give details of other companies that could be merged into NHPC.
""NTPC is more of a company which is into thermal and is going rapidly into green energy. They have very limited hydro assets,"" Singh said.
Solar and wind power plants are intermittent and need support from thermal, nuclear or hydropower plants.

""In FY'23, billing was Rs 24,432 crore, which is higher by around Rs 5,461 crore over the previous year. Apart from higher generation, regulatory approvals of tariff revision and the Union government's Late Payment Surcharge (

Sarkar said DVC ensured uninterrupted power to the industry in 2022-23 despite input
supply
chain disruptions.
""Amid unprecedented demand, we maintained power supply by blending imported coal to ensure seamless power to the country, which was recouping from the Covid pandemic,"" he said.
Elaborating on the company's performance, Sarkar said the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission had approved its tariff revision for 2017-18 to 2019-20 during 2022-23, and the
Jharkhand Electricity Regulatory Commission
did the same for 2020-21.
Realisation improved from discoms due to the LPS scheme that restricts power in case of non-payment, he said.
""DVC has already commenced production at its Tubed Coal Block in Jharkhand. The dry fuel is expected to be received soon at the company's power plant, which will help reduce dependence on external coal,"" Sarkar said.
Singh said the Koderma Unit 1 of 500 MW generated uninterrupted power for 393 days, a ""milestone"" considering 2 to 4 per cent forced outages are common in thermal power plants.
DVC plans to implement significant capacity addition in renewable energy in the near future, he added.

India's electricity consumption dips 0.74 pc to 127.52 billion units in March,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/indias-electricity-consumption-dips-0-74-pc-to-127-52-billion-units-in-march/articleshow/99186464.cms,02-04-2023,"India
's
power consumption
dipped 0.74 per cent to 127.52 billion units (BU) in
March
this year for the first time in 31 months, according to
government
data. The contraction in power
consumption
is mainly because of widespread rains due to western disturbances in the country and low temperature in March.
Last contraction in power consumption was recorded in August in 2020, when it declined by over two per cent to 109.21 BU, compared to 111.52 BU in August 2019.
Power consumption had slumped in 2020 due to the impact of lockdown restrictions imposed to curb the spread of deadly coronavirus.
Experts are hopeful that power consumption and
demand
would grow April onwards, due to further improvement in economic activities as well as rise in temperature.
In March 2022, power consumption stood at 128.47 billion units (BU), higher than the 120.63 BU in the same month of 2021, the data showed.
Live Events
Electricity consumption in March 2020 stood at 98.95 BU.
However, the data showed that the peak power demand met, which is the highest
supply
in a day, rose to 209.01 gigawatt (GW) in March 2023.
The peak power supply stood at 199.43 GW in March 2022 and 185.89 GW in March 2021.
The peak power demand met stood at 170.16 GW in the pre-pandemic March 2020.
Experts are of the view that the power consumption and demand would log higher growth rates in coming months due to forecasts of higher temperature during this summer season compared to last year.
Peak power demand is expected to touch 229 GW during this summer season as per power ministry estimates.

NARCL improves offer for Vidarbha Industries Power,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/narcl-improves-offer-for-vidarbha-industries-power/articleshow/99155787.cms,01-04-2023,"The government-promoted asset reconstruction company has given an improved counteroffer to lenders for acquiring the loans of Anil Ambani-promoted
Vidarbha Industries Power
, two people aware of the development told ET.
The National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (
NARCL
) offered ₹1,150 crore for the power company against an offer of ₹1,000 crore from CFM ARC, the people said.
The offer comes amid a landmark
Supreme Court
order that dismissed
Axis Bank
's petition to admit the company into insolvency stating that the tribunal, which approved admitting the company, should have factored in external factors that led to delay in payments by the defaulting borrower.
The offer by NARCL is a combination of 15% cash and 85% as security receipts, while that from CFM ARC is an upfront cash payment subject to all lenders agreeing to sell the debt.
NARCL did not respond to ET's request for comments.
Live Events
A rating report by
ICRA
issued on February 1 stated that the company has short-, long term loans and non-fund-based limits of ₹3,264 crore rated by them. The rating agency has assigned D rating and categorised the account as issuer not cooperating.
If the outstanding loans as rated by Icra are considered, lenders' recovery on NARCL offer would equates to 35% while the recovery from the CFM ARC offer is 30%.
The annual report of
Vidarbha Industries
for FY22, however, shows outstanding loans of ₹1,550 crore. Axis Bank,
State Bank of India
,
Bank of Baroda
,
Canara Bank
,
Punjab National Bank
and
Bank of Maharashtra
are lenders to the company.
The offer from these two ARCs has stoked expectations of a quick recovery for lenders disheartened with the Supreme Court order rejecting a plea to admit the company despite a default.
Also, if lenders accept NARCL's offer, their recovery would be higher on a per megawatt basis for Vidarbha than that made in some of the recent distressed power company sales.
NARCL's offer equates to a recovery of ₹1.88 crore per megawatt for Vidarbha Industries, which has two power-producing units of 300mw each. As against this, the lender's recovery on the sale of
Monnet Power
was ₹39 lakh per mw while that on the sale of Athena Chhattisgarh Power was ₹47 lakh per mw. Jindal Power and Steel and
Vedanta
acquired the distressed power producers, respectively, under liquidation.
Anil Ambani-promoted
Reliance Power
holds 74% and
Rosa Power Supply Company
owns the remaining 24%. It has two coal power plants in the state of Maharashtra. Both the plants are not operational since January 2019.
""This was due to protracted delays in issuing regulatory orders and lack of fuel supply for one of the units,"" said the rating report by ICRA.

The Lanco unit owns an unfinished hydro power plant near the pilgrim town of Kedarnath in Uttarakhand. The plant was partially destroyed by flash floods in 2013. The unit subsequently defaulted on bank loans.
Statkraft entered the Indian power market through its subsidiary SN Power in 2004, when it acquired 49 per cent of the shares in Malana Power Company Limited (MPCL). Statkraft was then the first foreign investor in the Indian hydropower sector.
Its energy generation portfolio in India includes two operating hydropower assets, one hydropower asset under construction and one solar power project also under construction. All three hydro assets are in Himachal Pradesh. The solar project is in Tamil Nadu. It is also involved in energy trading.
Globally, Statkraft operates in 17 countries. It has been in the clean energy business since 1895.
