fiscal deficit
for April-February was 13.47 trillion rupees ($157.62 billion), or 85.8% of the estimate for the financial year ending March 31, government data showed on Friday.
Net

Centre to borrow Rs 8 lk cr in 1st half of FY26 through dated papers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-to-borrow-rs-8-lk-cr-in-1st-half-of-fy26-through-dated-papers/articleshow/119612201.cms,28-03-2025,"The Centre will borrow ₹8 lakh crore from the market through dated securities in the first half of the next fiscal, which constitutes 54% of the full-year target, the
finance ministry
said on Thursday.
The amount is lower than 56-59% of the annual target that some analysts had projected but is slightly higher than what the government had announced for the first half of the current fiscal.
The borrowing includes ₹10,000 crore through
sovereign green bonds
.
Experts said the borrowing target aims to enable the government to fund its revenue gap in the first half of 2025-26 without causing any disruption in the bond market. It's also unlikely to crowd out state governments and private players in the debt market, they added.

Yield on the benchmark 10-year securities closed at 6.6022% on Thursday, hitting its lowest in more than three years.
The government has budgeted gross market borrowing of ₹14.82 lakh crore (through dated securities) for 2025-26. Of this, net borrowing is pegged at ₹11.54 lakh crore. It aims to contain its fiscal deficit at 4.4% of gross domestic product during the year, against 4.8% this fiscal. The borrowing in the first half is proposed to be over in 26 weekly tranches of ₹25,000-36,000 crore each, the finance ministry said in a statement.
""As hitherto, all the auctions covered by the (borrowing) calendar will have the facility of non-competitive bidding under which 5% of the notified amount will be reserved for the specified retail investors,"" the ministry said.
The share of borrowing under different maturities will be: three-year (5.3%), five-year (11.3%), seven-year (8.2%), 10-year (26.2%), 15-year (14%), 30-year (10.5%), 40-year (14%) and 50-year (10.5%).
""The borrowing target is along the expected lines. The composition of securities with different maturity periods, however, is tweaked a bit,"" said
India Ratings chief economist
DK Pant.
The proportion of shorter tenure (three-five years) papers is proposed to go up to 16.6% from 14.4% a year before and that of longer-term papers (15-50 years) will drop to 49% from 51.2%, Pant said. However, the share of medium-term (seven to 10-year) papers remains the same at 34.4%.
The government will reserve the right to exercise the greenshoe option to retain an additional subscription of up to ₹2,000 crore against each of the securities.
Weekly borrowing through treasury bills is expected to be ₹19,000 crore for 13 weeks, with issuance of 91-day papers worth ₹9,000 crore, 182-day ones worth ₹5,000 crore and another ₹5,000 crore through 364-day securities.
To meet temporary mismatches in the government accounts, the
Reserve Bank of India
has fixed the ways and means advances limit for the first half at ₹ 1.50 lakh crore.

A portion of this borrowing, amounting to Rs 10,000 crore, will be raised through Sovereign Green Bonds (SGrBs) to fund environmentally sustainable projects.
The borrowing will be conducted through 26 weekly auctions, with securities maturing between 3 and 50 years.

money laundering
and
terror financing
which are continuously evolving and becoming more sophisticated.,
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) governor
Sanjay Malhotra
said.
He also warned that even as policy makers work to make financial systems safe and secure against money laundering and terror financing, they need to be mindful that our measures are not over-zealous and do not stifle legitimate activities and investments.
“You would appreciate that multiple laws and rules, each with their own level of granularity cast a high level of burden of compliance on the regulated financial service providers…Therefore, we need to have laws and regulations which, with surgical precision, target only the illegitimate and illicit, rather than use them as blunt tools which unintentionally hurt even the honest,” Malhotra said. He was delivering a speech at the Private Sector Collaborative Forum (PSCF) 2025 of the
Financial Action Task Force
(FATF), here.
The governor said that while implementing regulations, a risk-based approach is recommended. “We need to continuously refine and improve our risk assessment models to make them robust,” he said.
FATF, the standard setting body for illicit financing was established in 1989. It has evolved from an organisation with only 16 members to a global forum with 40 members. The standards developed by FATF are used by over 200 jurisdictions to combat money laundering (ML), terrorism financing (TF) and proliferation financing.
Live Events
Malhotra said to make refinements in the risk assessment models, the quality of data has to be improved and emerging technologies, harnessed. “This will help improve screening of transactions and detection of suspicious activities thereby reducing false positives and false negatives. Considering the evolving landscape in the area of money laundering resulting from changing customer behaviour and evolving products and services, we need to continuously augment
Anti Money Laundering
(AML) risk assessment framework and make appropriate system enhancements on a regular basis after assessing the impact of machine learning and other risks,” he said.
Understanding the latest trends and developments in the financial world that can be exploited by criminals will allow to develop tools and enabling frameworks to detect suspicious transactions and activities early and take pre-emptive action.
While doing customer due diligence, reporting entities collect a large amount of data from customers. This information is sometime shared with the Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs), law enforcement agencies and data registries leading to concerns regarding
data protection
and sharing of information without consent. “India has recently enacted a law for Digital Personal Data Protection. Exchange of experiences from different jurisdictions will help us in better implementing the law in our country,” he said.
Malhotra said developing countries like India have made huge progress in making
digital payments
accessible, affordable, and convenient but to meet the G20 objective of making
cross-border payments
faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive, while maintaining their safety and security, it would be desirable to make the travel rule for cross border payments technology-neutral.
“Let us build financial systems that not only thwart the attempts of money laundering, terror financing and proliferation financing, but also support financial inclusion, encourage innovation, and facilitate economic growth,” he said.

India has made substantial progress on financial inclusion with 94 per cent of adults now having a bank account, Malhotra said, adding a word of caution for regulators.
Pitching for ""balanced regulations"", Malhotra said adopting a risk-based approach would be beneficial and added that assessing impact on people and businesses is essential. Malhotra said stakeholders also need to coordinate better and look at avoiding the ""unnecessary"" process of making people repeatedly undergo the know your customer (KYC) requirements.
Speaking about technology, Malhotra said while it has enabled ease of doing business, it has also led to sophisticated means of money laundering and illicit financing.

Impact on economy:
Money laundering (ML) and related underlying crimes, as well as terrorist financing (TF) and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or proliferation financing (PF) are crimes with economic effects—they can threaten the integrity and stability of a country’s financial sector and a country’s external stability more generally, an IMF report said.
Additionally, such activites can result in destabilizing “hot money” resulting from inflows and outflows, as well as in banking crisis, ineffective revenue collection, broader governance weaknesses, reputational risks for international financial centers, and loss of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs).
RBI remains alert:
Recently, the central bank in a report had flagged that with the rise in digitisation it has seen an increased risk of cyber attacks, digital frauds, data breaches and operational failures. In its report on Trend and Progress of Banking In India, the regulator called upon banks, non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) and co-operative banks to strengthen their risk management standards.
It also said that there was a need to have tighter IT governance arrangements and customer onboarding and transaction monitoring systems to check unscrupulous activities, including suspicious and unusual transactions.
The central bank has also asked banks, NBFCs, and other entities regulated by it to use information obtained from all relevant internal and external sources for their risk assessment exercise.
In this regard, the central bank has issued 'The Internal Risk Assessment Guidance for Money Laundering/ Terrorist Financing' for the REs, particularly for the dealing staff and the Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/ Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) / Counter Proliferation Financing (CPF) practitioners of the REs.

Modi banks on households to rein in a ₹29.7 lakh crore debt pile,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/modi-banks-on-households-to-rein-in-a-346-billion-debt-pile/articleshow/119515287.cms,26-03-2025,"Prime Minister Narendra
Modi
has a $346 billion
debt
problem that his administration wants help for from the nation’s
households
.
A record 29.7 trillion rupees ($346 billion) of
sovereign bonds
are due over the next five years, a result of pandemic-era
borrowing
and Modi’s infrastructure-spending binge. To tackle the burden, the Reserve Bank of India and the government are swapping maturing debt with longer-dated notes.
These refinancing debt auctions are gaining momentum thanks to an increasingly influential player: households. They’ve been pouring money into insurers, which in turn are buying heaps of long-dated sovereign bonds. The demand is so great that the head of Life Insurance Corp. of India, the nation’s largest, even floated the idea of issuing 100-year paper.
“Households are looking to deploy their savings pool in instruments that provide a longer-term investment horizon than the conventional banking system,” says Soumyajit Niyogi, director at India Ratings, a unit of Fitch Ratings. This shift is transforming India’s government securities market, he said.
The finance ministry has set a record target of 2.5 trillion rupees of debt to be swapped for the fiscal year starting April 1. With the insurance sector expanding at 12%-13% annually, the goal is within reach, according to Vidya Iyer, head of fixed income at ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, which had 3.1 trillion rupees in assets as of December.
Live Events
The
debt swap strategy
paid off last year. In the September quarter, the average yield on new issuances eased by 20 basis points to 6.9%, while their maturity stretched to 20.5 years, according to the latest government data.
Bloomberg
Insurers, keen for longer-term assets to match their liabilities, have piled into these switch operations, said Ajit Banerjee, chief investment officer at Shriram Life Insurance Ltd. Given the dearth of quality long-term debt papers in the market, the demand for sovereign notes is here to stay, he said.
To cash in on this trend, the government has tilted its borrowing toward long-tenor paper. In the current fiscal year ending March 31, the government packed 38% of its debt sales in bonds maturing in 30 years or more, up from 25% four years ago. New Delhi is due to announce its borrowing plan for the April-September period this week.
Bond Vigilantes
For India’s public finance managers, this demand is a welcome shift from just a few years back, when bond vigilantes would quickly push up borrowing costs at the slightest hint of increased borrowings.
To be sure, the government’s switch strategy faces challenges. A sharp increase in provincial debt sales, driven by increased spending on welfare programs, may reduce the attractiveness for insurers. States typically offer higher yields.
The “real test of demand” will occur in the year that starts April 1 as provinces also step up longer-tenor debt sales, according to A. Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.
Still, what gives policymakers confidence in debt switch auctions is the growth outlook for the insurance sector. Analysts at Swiss Re predict that India’s insurance market will be the fastest-growing in the Group-of-20 nations over the next five years, with 90% of premiums flowing into investment products.
Bloomberg
“Demand for long bonds is here to stay and insurance companies will remain the primary players in determining the shape of the yield curve at the long end,” ICICI Prudential’s Iyer said.

Yields of March help states borrow more in absence of G-Secs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/yields-of-march-help-states-borrow-more-in-absence-of-g-secs/articleshow/119496680.cms,26-03-2025,"Mumbai: States have increased their borrowings in the last month of the financial year, as raising funds is comparatively cheaper with low yields, due to the absence of central
government security auctions
in March, treasury experts said.
Cut-off on 10-year SDL paper
""The absence of G-Sec supply has facilitated strong absorption of SDL issuances by
institutional investors
. They are also positioning ahead of the April policy, anticipating rate cuts in April and/or June to drive mark-to-market gains in the next fiscal year,"" said
Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan

state development loans
(SDL) security was 7.05%.
In the previous three SDL auctions held in March, the amount raised by state governments was revised upward by about ₹10,000 crore. The yields on SDL have fallen steadily since the beginning of this month, with bonds sold in the range of 7.34-7.21%.
The 10-year yields of the benchmark government security were traded at 6.64% on Tuesday, down from 6.72% at the beginning of March, CCIL data showed.
Softer SDL yields are due to the absence of central government security auctions and expectations of a rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy on April 9, experts said.

Experts view
Experts believe liquidity infusion by the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has also provided banks with enough funds, enabling them to invest in SDLs. The
RBI
has been conducting operations to infuse durable liquidity via open market operations and foreign exchange swaps.
""There has been a lot of liquidity provided by the RBI, so unless we don't have other government security auctions, these SDL auctions will see an increase in demand,"" said

, chief economist at
Bank of Baroda
.
The average liquidity deficit in the banking system is around ₹1.6 lakh crore.

movements are a function of investor perceptions along with factors, including global economic scenarios. Geo-political uncertainties affecting foreign capital flows, domestic macro-economic parameters and overall corporate performance are among the economic conditions that impact stock market performances.

electronics
and
automobile
sectors, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. Addressing an event organised by Chennai Citizens' forum on Saturday evening, Sitharaman dismissed charges of the state government that the Centre has neglected Tamil Nadu in terms of funding. She said major 'big ticket' projects have been announced and are progressing at various stages of implementation across the State.
""Tamil Nadu has been the largest beneficiary under the PLI- scheme in electronics, electronic parts and automobiles. Out of the 27 companies that have received approval from the Centre, 7 are based out of Tamil Nadu,"" the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs noted.
Sitharaman highlighted that 25 per cent of the companies availing benefits from the
PLI scheme
are from the state, she said drawing applause from the audience at the M O P Vaishnav College in the city.
Without naming the government or any individual, she rejected claims that the state received minimal revenue from central taxes. ""These people arrive at a calculation that the Centre was giving a minimal amount of revenue from the central taxes. I really do not know how they pose such an argument. All I have to say is that the State has been a beneficiary in various central schemes and sector specific initiatives in the last 10 years.""
She also pointed out that Tamil Nadu hosts one of the country's two major electronic parts manufacturing clusters, alongside Gujarat. An allocation of Rs 1,100 crore has been made for setting up the cluster in Tamil Nadu.

Tamil Nadu has secured approval for four firms under the PLI-scheme, for advanced chemistry cell battery manufacturing.
Additionally, the Centre has sanctioned Rs 7,453 crore through the Viability Gap Funding Scheme to develop offshore shore wind energy projects in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. ""With the Centre's support, the country's first Green Hydrogen Hub Port has been planned for Tuticorin,"" she said.

""For the world, AI means artificial intelligence, but for me, AI also means American-Indian spirit. This is the new 'AI' power of the world....I salute the Indian diaspora here,"" he said. That was also the time when the spotlight fell on leaders of Indian origin in the US: Kamala Harris, Usha Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy and Kash Patel.
The
NRI
s and Indian-origin people in the West have long been seen as India's soft power due to their remarkable success in Western countries. But increasingly, they are also giving India hard power: the power of money. A recent analysis by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows Share of inward
remittances
from advanced economies, including the US and the UK, has risen, surpassing that of Gulf economies in 2023-24, reflecting a shift in migration pattern towards skilled Indian diaspora. India's remittances, which have more than doubled from $55.6 billion in 2010-11 to $118.7 billion in 2023-24, give the country hard power. While financing around half of India's merchandise trade deficit, net remittance receipts have been an important absorber of external shocks during this period. High remittance inflows contribute to financial stability of the country.
Rise of the white-collar NRI
Indian migrants in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries account for around half of the total Indian migrants in the world. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the largest hub for Indian migrant workers engaged primarily in blue-collar jobs which are dominated by the construction industry followed by healthcare, hospitality, and tourism.
The RBI article said there is a gradual shift seen in remittance sources. ""The results of the survey highlight the gradual shift in dominance of India's remittances from the GCC countries to the AEs (advanced economies) particularly the US, the UK, Singapore, Canada and Australia which together accounted for more than half of the remittances in 2023-24,"" the article said.
The GCC countries (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain) together contributed 38 per cent to total remittances received by India in 2023-24, higher than its share recorded in 2020-21 (COVID-19 pandemic year).
Live Events
The share of the US in India’s total remittances remained largest, rising to 27.7 per cent. The UAE, the largest hub for Indian migrant workers, maintained its position as the second largest source of India’s remittances, with its share increasing from 18 per cent in 2020-21 to 19.2 per cent in 2023-24. ""This is in stark contrast to the US where Indian migrants are mainly employed in the white-collar jobs, thus explaining the higher remittances received from US despite the lower number of migrants as compared to the UAE,"" the article said.
For Indians, opportunities to work in foreign countries first started pouring in a big way during the seventies when the oil boom in the Persian gulf countries created openings for Indian semi-skilled workers. This led to some initial pick up in remittances. Later in the nineties, the IT boom created a huge market for Indian skilled IT professionals in advanced economies in North America and Europe. This led to a surge in remittances to India leading India to emerge as one of the top recipients of remittances.
The success of the NRIs who have reached top positions in several fields in advanced countries has led to more remittances from those countries.
The astounding success story of Indian-Americans
A report by BCG and Indiaspora, a nonprofit organization comprising of global Indian origin leaders, has numbers that narrate the desi success story in the US: 51 lakh Indian diaspora at present has a median income of $136,000, which is almost double the US average, and they account for just 1.5% of the US population but paying 5-6% of US taxes. The desi dominance is in all fields and not just technology.
“One in 10 physicians in the US is an Indian-American, serving 30% of patients… Sixty per cent of all US hotels are owned by members of the diaspora, generating $700 billion in revenue and creating over 40 lakh jobs… Indian Americans own an estimated 35-50% of all convenience stores in the US, representing $350-490 billion in revenues each year…. Starting with one unicorn in 2010, India has seen exponential growth reaching 114 unicorns as of March 2024… India is the leading country of origin for immigrant-founded unicorns in the US in the last five years,” the report titled “Small Community, Big Contributions, Boundless Horizons” said.
A large number of Indians went to the US for coding jobs over the past couple of decades. But because the education in schools and colleges in India is not only about Maths and Science, they had learnt to negotiate; tackle real-life problems and make an overall societal impact, Rohit Jain, CIO, Harvard Business School Alumni Association, had told TOI two years year. “The fact that we knew programming well also helped many Indians to make a natural progression to management roles in the US. And, of course, having degrees from top American management schools brought more to the table with many Indian Americans making big transitions to CEO and senior VP positions,” Jain had said.
Indians are among the biggest leaders of innovation in Silicon Valley and America's tech industry cannot survive without them, the CEO of the Silicon Valley Central Chamber of Commerce Harbir K Bhatia had told news agency PTI in an interview in last year. ""Indians are one of the biggest drivers of innovation in Silicon Valley,"" Bhatia said in the interview. ""The tech industry here wouldn't be the same without them."" Bhatia said nearly 40% of Silicon Valley CEOs or founders hailed from India. She emphasized the impact Indian-Americans have on major corporations. ""They're leading companies like Google, YouTube, Microsoft - at the CEO or CXO level,"" Bhatia said. ""This doesn't happen by accident."" Bhatia attributes this success to a strong cultural emphasis on hard work and achievement.
Why NRIs are increasingly investing back home
Increasingly, the NRIs are investing in India across asset classes. In an interview with ET, Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder & CEO, FinEdge, listed four reasons why India is currently attracting significant interest from NRI investors.
Rise of the Indian Economy led by favourable demographics:
India’s rapid economic growth, marked by the tag of the world’s fastest-growing major economy, has been a big factor for the country attracting investments from all over the world. Being tipped as a huge consumption and manufacturing story India is projected to become a 5 trillion-dollar economy by 2025. With structural reforms and huge spending on infrastructure, the government of the day is ensuring that the right growth drivers are in place for India to become a developed economy by 2047. We are fast approaching tipping points in higher per capita income which should lead to exponential growth over the next two decades.
Performance of the Indian Stock Market:
The Indian stock market has consistently delivered strong returns over the past years and there has been large retail participation happening in the overall stock market growth story. A growing economy translates into higher stock market valuation and hence the long-term prospects of the stock markets remain upbeat in line with these growth projections. The Indian stock market is also considered among the most well-regulated in the world.
Improved Standard of Living:
We are increasingly seeing the trend of reverse brain drain happening in India. With opportunities abound and the start-up ecosystem coming of age, a lot of global Indians are moving back to capitalise on this trend. The improved living standard with infrastructure upgrades is adding to India becoming an attractive destination for NRIs to own assets here.
Depreciation of the Indian Rupee:
The weakening of the Indian Rupee against major global currencies offers NRIs a favourable exchange rate advantage. This depreciation makes investing in Indian assets, including real estate and equities more advantageous for NRIs earning in foreign currency.

Gold Price Paradox: A $13 billion naked short on yellow metal in India that loves glitter,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gold-price-paradox-a-13-billion-naked-short-on-yellow-metal-in-india-that-loves-glitter/articleshow/119283886.cms,21-03-2025,"Back in 2015, India’s finance ministry had a clever idea: Why not borrow cheaply by promising returns linked to bling? In the process, the officials would wean the country off a costly addiction. Indians would be able to satiate their world-beating appetite for gold by punting on something even more glittering.
That something, the mandarins reckoned, could only be a government-backed investment option that allowed investors to earn some cash while speculating on the price of their best-loved commodity — without actually having to buy it.
But the officials forgot a cardinal rule. If a trade looks too good to be true, it probably is.
As it’s becoming painfully evident now, India’s 10-year-old sovereign gold bond program is just a $13 billion naked short position for the government, an albatross around its neck at a time when bullion prices have gone parabolic and show no sign of subsiding. It’s the taxpayers who are on the hook for paying that money to bondholders.
This wasn’t how the program was supposed to run. The special debt, it was decided, would pay a 2.75% coupon (reduced later to 2.5%), and the investment itself would be measured in grams of gold. Upon redemption eight years later, investors would be given the prevailing market value of the metal in rupee terms.
Live Events
At least on paper, it all made sense. With the euro zone back from the brink of a messy breakup, the demand for safe havens was on its way down globally. Suppose someone bought 1 gram worth of the metal-linked bonds in November 2015 for a little over 2,500 rupees, which came to about $38 in those days. Even if New Delhi had to redeem the notes for 50% more — 3,750 rupees -- the borrowing cost would still be less than the near-8% yield on regular government debt.
There were other advantages. To the extent people would be drawn to the financial product, they would be less keen to buy the physical asset, saving India some of the $30 billion in hard currency that it had spent annually over the previous decade on imports of the precious metal.
However, nearly every one of those assumption came a cropper. First, international prices zoomed — from just about $1,500 an ounce in late 2019 to $3,000 now. The very first bond matured at more than double its issue price, making it a costly form of borrowing. Two, the popular craze for bullion never really went away even as it became more expensive. Average annual imports have stood at $37 billion over the past 10 years. To nip this demand, New Delhi raised customs duties to 15% in 2022.
Bloomberg
That little maneuver also backfired. It boosted the domestic price, further ballooning the government’s outgo on maturing bonds. New Delhi panicked. Last year, it slashed import tariffs to 6%.
But that was before the US elections in November. With Donald Trump in the White House, the value of the world’s preferred inflation hedge is going through the roof amid fears of what his tariffs would do to consumer prices. This week, a bond sold in March 2017 was redeemed for more than 8,600 rupees, or three times the issue price of the 1 gram note. Investors “have hit a jackpot,” the Economic Times noted.
Also Read:
Investors hit jackpot with SGB, gain 3x on gold bond redemption at Rs 8,624 per gram
Taxpayers have come up snake eyes, though. Do the math. The government sold bonds worth 147 tons in 67 tranches. As of last month, New Delhi was still on the hook for 132 tons, which translates to a liability of 1.2 trillion rupees ($13 billion) at current prices. The last bond will only retire in February 2032. Who knows what the commodity will cost seven years from now.
If the current frenzy in market prices proves durable, large losses are almost guaranteed. Some analysts have noted that the central bank’s gold — 879 tons last month — offers a natural hedge. But the Reserve Bank of India has acquired those quantities to diversify the base of safe assets backing its liabilities: the domestic money supply. They were never meant to backstop the government’s borrowing.
Already, the share of the precious metal in the RBI’s foreign-exchange reserves has risen to 11.5%, the highest on record, according to the World Gold Council. If the market gets the sense that they are being amassed to pay off creditors in the future, it will raise difficult questions about the institution’s independence.
The whole thing is an avoidable mess. India has thrown in the towel, and discontinued fresh issuances of the bonds. But that was only after it took in 270 billion rupees during the fiscal year that ended last March, the most in the program’s truncated history.
Indians’ love of the yellow metal is coded in their DNA, for reasons that have as much to do with culture as economic security. For many families, especially in rural areas, it is the only asset they can pledge in a pinch. Adding to the sheen, it’s the country’s best-performing investment so far this year, a cushion against brutal losses in the stock market. It was valiant of the government to try to tamp the popular impulse for hoarding gold, but reckless of it to mount an unhedged bet against a basic instinct.

"Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu get over half of $118-billion remittances in FY24",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/maharashtra-kerala-and-tamil-nadu-get-over-half-of-118-billion-remittances-in-fy24/articleshow/119269898.cms,21-03-2025,"Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, in that order, were the three top states receiving
remittances
from overseas Indians, accounting for half the $118.7 billion received under this category in FY24.
The results of the central bank survey on remittances highlight the gradual shift in dominance of India's remittances from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to the more advanced economies particularly the US, the UK, Singapore, Canada and Australia, which together accounted for more than half of the remittances.
Most Indians working in these countries are employed in white-collar jobs, in sectors as diverse as finance, medicine, technology, diversified industry, and tertiary academics. Inward remittances have more than doubled since FY11 when the country received about $55 billion as remittances. Two major factors have contributed to the surge in remittances. One is the rise in global migration. India's stock of international migrants has tripled from 6.6 million in 1990 to 18.5 million in 2024. Maharashtra, Telangana and Punjab accounted for the largest number of migrating students who stayed back for employment opportunities. This is reflected in the increasing share of these states in India's inward remittances.
The Kerala Migration Survey highlights that there was a considerable rise in the number of students among the total emigrants from Kerala in 2023.
The average cost of remittances decreased from 6.5% in 2016 to 5% in 2024 driven by a sharp fall in cost of digital transfer (down from 7.5% to 4% during the period). The digital channel is also gaining share in remittances. Notably remittances are a major source of India's external sector strength, funding on an average 40% of India's trade deficit. Going forward, remittances to India are likely to remain elevated and are projected to increase to around $160 billion in 2029, central bank projections showed.

Two-third of ₹43 lakh crore tax demand 'difficult' to collect: Income Tax Dept,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/two-thirds-of-43-lakh-crore-tax-demand-difficult-to-collect-income-tax-dept/articleshow/119255044.cms,20-03-2025,"Two-third of Rs 43 lakh crore outstanding
direct tax demand
is ""difficult to collect"",
Income Tax Department
has informed a Parliamentary panel. When the Standing Committee on Finance expressed concern over the huge arrears of demand and desired to know the possible steps, including a moratorium, that can be taken to address this, the Chairman of
CBDT
told the panel that arrears are a cause for concern.
""We have around Rs 43,00,000 crore of arrear demand which is a cause of concern for us. Partly, this is a legacy issue. This arrear pertains to mid-90s also because earlier what used to happen was there was essentially a manual registers that we were keeping,"" the
CBDT Chairman
told the panel.
The report of the Standing Committee on Finance has been tabled in Parliament.
The Revenue Secretary informed the panel that a lot of this demand is also ""fictitious"".
The Committee found that in respect of Direct Taxes, Rs 10,55,906 crore
tax arrears
are pending for five or more years.
Live Events
""The Committee has been given to understand that some of the arrears date back even to the mid-1990s,"" the report said.
The panel also noted that as per tax authorities, out of Rs 43,07,201 crore arrears, Rs 28,95,851 crore which comes to 67 per cent, is difficult to collect. It also found that a lot of this demand arrear is also fictitious.
Before the digitisation of processes, a manual register system was in place, which did not account for interest.
However, the current system now calculates interest annually.
""Since
income tax
penalty is very heavy, every year of delay will keep on adding to the demand, which is in any case remains non-collectible. The Committee express their concern over the present scenario and believe that there is a pressing need to review the tax assessment system to make it more efficient in collection of taxes, keeping in view the ground realities,"" the report said.
The Committee was of the view that while genuine demands should be strictly collected, the tax authorities should also undertake a thorough introspection of the existing tax assessment system and remain sensitive to the hardships faced by honest taxpayers due to erroneous or inflated tax demands.
The Committee recommend that, since all the tax records have been digitised, it is ""high time to take decisive interventions"", including writing off demands/ imposing moratoriums, to reduce and trueing up the huge backlog of demand arrears in a time-bound manner, the report said.

Govt's divestment plan to push fundraising activities in FY26: Emkay Global,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/govts-divestment-plan-to-push-fundraising-activities-in-fy26-emkay-global/articleshow/119252434.cms,20-03-2025,"The government's divestment plan is likely to provide a push to fundraising in FY26 as the recent market correction has slowed down deal-making activity,
Emkay Global Financial Services
said on Thursday. Addressing a webinar on the state of affairs of the Indian investment banking industry, Yatin Singh, CEO of investment banking at Emkay Global Financial Services, said the public sector is turning out to be material client for investment banks in India with the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) setting a divestment target of Rs 47,000 crore for FY26.
""This is a huge opportunity for investment banks in FY26 and beyond,"" he said.
Over the past three years, the initial public offers (IPOs) of
LIC
, IREDA, and the offer for sale (OFS) of
ONGC
,
IRCTC
,
HAL
,
Coal India
,
RVNL
,
NHPC
,
Hudco
, Ircon, and
Cochin Shipyard
have kept the deal street buzzing within the PSU segment.
Looking ahead, the upcoming IPOs of Bharat Coking Coal, Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd (MNGL), along with the QIP/OFS of IREDA, Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), Veedol, Central Bank,
UCO Bank
,
IOB
,
Bank of Maharashtra
, and Punjab & Sind Bank are expected to present significant opportunities for the investment banking industry in FY26 and beyond, Singh added.
The steep correction in the equity market has started showing its impact on
fundraising activities
. This slowdown in IPO activity is reflected in the numbers, as only five companies went public in January and four in February, compared to 15 public issues in January-February 2024.
Live Events
In addition, fundraising through
qualified institutional placements
(QIPs) was limited to only 7 in January-March 2025 as compared to 18 in the year-ago period.
This shift followed a remarkable 2024, in which 92 maiden public issues collectively raised over Rs 1.6 lakh crore, along with companies raised over Rs 1.36 lakh crore through 91 QIPs. This was driven by robust retail participation, a resilient economy, and booming private capital expenditure.
The broader market Sensex has fallen around 3 per cent so far this year due to a combination of domestic and global factors. The Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) withdrew Rs 1.46 lakh crore from the Indian equities in 2025 so far.
The resilient Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows are supporting markets to a large extent as monthly contribution through the route has been over Rs 20,000 crore for the past 11 months (April 2024-February 2025). Moreover, the SIP flows have risen to over Rs 25,000 crore for the past five months which is quite an encouraging sign, despite negative returns from the market since September 2024.
""The street was expecting a slowdown and fall in SIP flows, which is quite normal in a falling market. A fall in SIP going forward could have a severe impact on overall market performance,"" Singh said.
Singh said key decisions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to boost lending are expected to trigger liquidity in the markets in the near to medium term.
The bank credit is expected to get a strong boost in the medium to long term due to repo rate cut, relaxation of risk weights for Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) on NBFC loans by 25 per cent, liquidity measures undertaken by the RBI and measures announced in the Union Budget to boost consumption demand, he added.

"UPI incentive of Rs 1,500 crore 'insufficient' to sustain digital payment ecosystem: Payments Council of India",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/upi-incentive-of-rs-1500-crore-insufficient-to-sustain-digital-payment-ecosystem-payments-council-of-india/articleshow/119248251.cms,20-03-2025,"The
Payments Council of India
(PCI) on Thursday raised alarm over the sustainability of the
digital payments ecosystem
, citing concerns about the recent
zero MDR policy
and reduced government incentives at Rs 1,500 crore for FY25.
As
fintech companies
navigate a rapidly evolving landscape, the PCI said that there is a pressing need for a viable revenue model to support ongoing investments in payment processing and customer acquisition.
While the PCI noted the vital role of government incentives in fostering the growth of digital payment systems, they pointed out that the current incentive structure is 'inadequate' to meet the demands of an expanding fintech industry.

Cabinet approves extension of incentives for UPI transactions up to Rs 2,000 for small merchants
""The payment service providers are already struggling with increasing deployment, servicing, and regulatory compliance costs. It is pertinent to note that the Rs 1500 crore allocated incentive is inadequate for the industry to sustain. Given the current state of the payment service, the industry had expected either higher incentives or the introduction of a
controlled MDR
for large merchants (with a turnover of more than Rs 40 lakhs), but neither has materialized,"" said PCI.
Live Events
Vishwas Patel, Joint Managing Director of
Infibeam Avenues
and Chairman of the PCI, expressed his apprehensions about the future of digital payments.
“Continual growth, progress, and penetration of the
UPI
to the next 300 million Indians should be the only aim and goal for all of us. With Zero
MDR
on the UPI and the government allocating only Rs 1,500 crores for processing transactions worth Rs 246.82 lakh crores in 2024, is much less than what is required,” he said, stressing that the current funding will hinder the ecosystem's ability to access necessary capital for scaling.
""The ecosystems expectation was for a higher incentive than last year’s Rs 3,500 crores, and the current allocation of Rs 1,500 crores may fall short of sustaining the pace of progress,” he added.
The PCI's concerns are out of the realization that without a sustainable revenue model, several fintech players may be forced to reconsider their market strategies, further likely impacting innovation and broader acceptance of digital payments.
The council is particularly worried that the lack of a controlled MDR on UPI and Rupay transactions will deter entities from investing in customer acquisition, ultimately stunting growth and adoption.
Patel further highlighted the challenges faced by the fintech industry, and said, “With the ongoing challenges faced by the fintech industry, it will be increasingly difficult to onboard new users to the digital payments system, especially in areas where deployment and servicing costs are rising, along with increased regulatory compliance costs.""
The PCI has urged the government to implement nominal, controlled MDR on UPI and Rupay P2M transactions for large merchants, while maintaining Zero MDR incentives for smaller merchants. ""This approach could provide a more balanced solution that supports the growth and sustainability of the digital payments ecosystem,"" Patel said.

Key Suggestions
The committee, in its recommendations in a report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, called for proactively addressing liquidity concerns, enhancing customer attraction, especially in underserved areas, and leveraging technology for operational efficiency so that banks can mitigate the impact of declining CASA (current account savings account) ratios.
FDI in
insurance
On the issue of the budgetary announcement of 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector, the committee underscored the need for some safeguard measures to be in place to counter concerns such as profit repatriation, which refers to foreign investors sending earnings back to home countries rather than reinvesting in India, reduced decision-making power of domestic firms and job security concerns arising from potential automation and cost-cutting measures. While highlighting other issues such as the focus on high-margin policies and neglecting rural and financially weaker sections, the committee recommended that the downside of FDI in India's insurance sector be dealt with ""adequately and scrupulously"".

While noting that the number of complaints received under the Reserve Bank of India's Integrated Ombudsman Scheme had increased at a compounded average growth rate of almost 50% over the past two years to about 934,000 in 2023-24, the committee said mechanisms should be put in place for resolution of grievances spanning multiple sectors.
Jan Dhan accounts
The committee made a case for ensuring that accounts opened under the scheme are active and not dormant or fraudulent and recommended rigorous verification of account details and regular audits of account activity.
""Discrepancies should be thoroughly investigated and accounts that are inactive for prolonged periods or found to be fraudulent should be deactivated,"" it said.

Share of remittances to India from advance economies surpasses that of Gulf: RBI Bulletin,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/share-of-remittances-to-india-from-advance-economies-surpasses-that-of-gulf-rbi-bulletin/articleshow/119216427.cms,19-03-2025,"Share of
inward remittances
from advanced economies, including the US and the UK, has risen, surpassing that of Gulf economies in 2023-24, reflecting a shift in migration pattern towards skilled
Indian diaspora
, said RBI March Bulletin released on Wednesday. India's remittances have more than doubled from USD 55.6 billion in 2010-11 to USD 118.7 billion in 2023-24. While financing around half of India's merchandise trade deficit, net remittance receipts have been an important absorber of external shocks during this period.
An article 'Changing Dynamics of India's Remittances - Insights from the Sixth Round of India's Remittances Survey' published in the Bulletin captures various dimensions of inward
remittances to India
- country-wise source of remittances, statewise destination of remittances, transaction-wise size of remittances, prevalent modes of transmission.
It noted that India's stock of international migrants has tripled from 6.6 million in 1990 to 18.5 million in 2024, with its share in global migrants rising from 4.3 per cent to over 6 per cent during the same period.
Indian migrants in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries account for around half of the total Indian migrants in the world.
Besides GCC countries, advance economies (AEs) have also emerged as a major source of inward remittances to India over the years, reflecting the changing dynamics of India's diaspora.
Live Events
As India's working-age population is expected to rise till 2048, India would be the world's leading supplier of labour, it said.
""The results of the survey highlight the gradual shift in dominance of India's remittances from the GCC countries to the AEs particularly the US, the UK, Singapore, Canada and Australia which together accounted for more than half of the remittances in 2023-24,"" the article said.
The sixth round of the survey on inward remittances for 2023-24 covered 30 AD banks (capturing around 99 per cent of the value of total inward remittances reported under the purpose of family maintenance and savings), two major Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), and two fintech companies operating in cross-border remittance business.
The share of the US in India's total remittances remained largest, rising to 27.7 per cent in 2023-24 from 23.4 per cent in 2020-21.
The share of inward remittances received from the UK has also increased to 10.8 per cent in 2023-24 from 6.8 per cent in 2020-21.
United Arab Emirates (UAE) maintained its position as the second largest source of India's remittances, with its share increasing from 18 per cent in 2020-21 to 19.2 per cent in 2023-24.
UAE is the largest hub for Indian migrant workers engaged primarily in blue-collar jobs which are dominated by the construction industry followed by healthcare, hospitality, and tourism industry.
This is in stark contrast to the US where Indian migrants are mainly employed in white-collar jobs, the article said.
Maharashtra received the largest share of 20.5 per cent in 2023-24, albeit lower than 2020-21 (35.2 per cent).
Kerala followed closely with its share increasing to 19.7 per cent from about 10 per cent during the same period, followed by Tamil Nadu (10.4 per cent), Telangana (8.1 per cent), and Karnataka (7.7 per cent).
Maharashtra, Telangana and Punjab accounted for the largest number of Indian students migrating abroad for education and staying back for employment opportunities, which is reflected in the increasing share of these states in India's inward remittances.
In terms of value (size) of transactions, remittances amounting to more than Rs 5 lakh had the highest share of around 29 per cent in 2023-24, the article said.

The scheme, which covers transactions up to Rs 2,000/- for small Merchants, will be implemented for one year, from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025 (post facto). Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw later clarified that this scheme will be continued for the next year, too. Under this initiative, small merchants accepting UPI payments will receive an incentive at the rate of 0.15% per transaction.
The government had last week said that the ""Incentive Scheme for the promotion of RuPay Debit Cards and low value BHIM-UPI transactions Person to merchant (P2M)"" has significantly contributed to the growth of digital payments in the country.
As per the official data, the total digital payment transactions have grown from 8,839 crore in FY 2021-22 to 18,737 crore in FY 2023-24, with a CAGR of 46%, largely driven by UPI, increasing from 4,597 crore transactions in FY 2021-22 to 13,116 crore transactions in FY 2023-24.

For customers, this move means seamless, charge-free digital payments at their favorite local stores. Whether buying groceries, tea, or daily essentials, they can continue using UPI without any extra burden.
The incentive of 0.15% per transaction (for transactions up to Rs 2,000) will be provided to small merchants, helping them embrace digital payments without worrying about transaction fees.
How this will work
Zero MDR for all:
The scheme ensures that no Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is charged on UPI transactions, making digital payments cost-effective.
Encouraging digital transactions:
Small merchants will receive a 0.15% incentive per transaction for UPI payments under Rs 2,000.
No benefits for large merchants
: The incentive applies only to small merchants, ensuring support for local businesses.
The government said that 80% of the admitted claim amount for incentives will be disbursed to banks every quarter without any conditions, to make it quick reimbursement process. The remaining 20% will be paid only if banks maintain high service standards, such as: 10% bonus if the bank’s technical decline rate is below 0.75%; 10% bonus if the bank maintains over 99.5% system uptime.

India's direct tax collections rise 16.2% to Rs 25.9 lakh crore as of March 16,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-direct-tax-collections-rise-16-2-to-rs-25-9-lakh-crore-as-of-march-16/articleshow/119115864.cms,17-03-2025,"India's direct tax collections was up 16.15 per cent year-on-year, reaching Rs 25.86 lakh crore as of March 16, as per the latest data released by the
Central Board of Direct Taxes
(CBDT).
This rise in collections is attributed to higher corporate and non-corporate tax revenues, as well as a significant surge in securities transaction tax (STT) receipts.
Corporate tax collections rose to Rs 12.40 lakh crore, up from Rs 10.1 lakh crore in the previous fiscal.
The Non-corporate tax collections surged to Rs 12.90 crore from Rs 10.91 lakh crore last fiscal year.
Live Events
Securities transaction tax (STT) collections witnessed a sharp increase, reaching Rs 53,095 crore, compared to Rs 34,131 crore in the previous year.
Direct taxes are the taxes that individuals and businesses pay directly to the government. They include income tax, Corporate Tax, and Securities transaction tax.
Other taxes, including wealth tax, saw a decline from Rs 3,656 crore to Rs 3,399 crore.
After accounting for refunds, which also saw a significant jump of 32.51 percent to Rs 4.6 lakh crore, the net direct tax collection stood at Rs 21.26 lakh crore, reflecting a 13.13 percent increase compared to Rs 18.8 lakh crore in the same period last year.
The rise in tax collections is a positive sign for India's fiscal health, as it strengthens the government's revenue base and reduces dependence on borrowing.

Bankruptcy
Code (IBC), of which 28,818 applications involving Rs 10 lakh crore were resolved even before admission, Union Minister of State for Corporate Affairs Harsh Malhotra said in Lok Sabha on Monday. He also said that the introduction of the
IBC
in 2016 significantly benefited India, improving its global rank by 56 places to reach 52 in 2019 from 108 in 2018.
""Under IBC, 40,943 applications were filed of which 28,818 applications were resolved even before admission. This itself is a big achievement. Of those resolved, the total amount involved was around Rs 10 lakh crore. Among those which are pending or under trial, 1,119 have gone for resolution and resolved,"" he said.
The minister said many reforms have been brought with regards to home buyers.
""If any big builder or a consumer goes to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which is a quasi-judicial body, we have ensured resolution tower-to-tower basis. We have ensured possession of home buyers even during proceedings,"" he said.
Malhotra said as per information provided by NCLT, the number of cases pending under the Companies Act were 8,133 and under the IBC were 12,351 as on December 31,2024.
Live Events
He said there were several reasons for the pendency of cases in NCLT, which depends on circumstances and complexity of each case, nature of evidence, number of Interlocutory Applications (IA), stay by the higher courts in many cases, cooperation of stake holders and adjournments.
""To facilitate expeditious disposal, the government is taking necessary steps on an ongoing basis, which include implementation of e-court and hybrid court project, regular colloquiums for capacity building of members, provisions of infrastructure, filling up of vacancies, etc,"" he said.
The minister said the government has taken a number of initiatives under
Ease of Doing Business
(EoDB), which are aimed at creating a conducive business environment.
""As a part of the above, Doing Business Report (DBR) 2019 was published by the World Bank. India's rank in resolving insolvency in the above report was 52,"" he said.
The World Bank discontinued publishing its Doing Business Report (DBR) in September 2021, with the last report released in October 2019.
Malhotra said the B-Ready (Business Ready) project is a new initiative by the World Bank to replace the earlier Doing Business rankings.
""The B-Ready assessment focuses on various stages of a business lifecycle, including starting a business, dealing with construction permits and resolving insolvency. The first B-Ready report was launched on October 3rd, 2024, and India is covered in the third phase of the project. The report covering India is expected in September 2026,"" he said.
The IBC 2016 has been instrumental in maintaining a minimal backlog of insolvency cases, thereby improving India's ease of doing business and enhancing its overall investment climate, he said.

NBFC sector strengthens with RBIs positive stance and rate cut support for growth: Jefferies,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/nbfc-sector-strengthens-with-rbis-positive-stance-and-rate-cut-support-for-growth-jefferies/articleshow/119034071.cms,15-03-2025,"The fundamentals of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are showing signs of improvement as macroeconomic challenges ease and the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) adopts a more supportive stance, according to Jefferies.
With stabilizing asset quality, improving liquidity, and emerging rate tailwinds, the sector is poised for steady growth. The overall macroeconomic environment is improving with increased government spending and RBI's measures to ease liquidity constraints.
The central bank's recent risk weight reduction on bank lending to NBFCs signals a constructive approach, which should enhance funding access, particularly for smaller NBFCs.
Additionally, a recent 25-basis-point
interest rate cut
, along with potential future cuts, is expected to support net interest margins (NIMs) across the sector.
The asset quality (AQ) of NBFCs is showing stabilization across key segments. Collections have improved in recent months, and while gross non-performing assets (GNPA) may rise slightly in Q1 FY26, the increase is expected to be lower than last year.
Live Events
However, the microfinance institution (MFI) segment remains under stress, particularly in Karnataka, where a microfinance ordinance impacted collection efficiency.
Despite some improvements in other states, the transition to MFIN 2.0 regulations in April 2025 could add further pressure to the MFI segment.
However, spillover effects from unsecured MFI loans to secured loan products remain limited. NBFC exposure to MFI overlaps is highest in gold loans (9 per cent), small-ticket loans like micro LAP/PL (6-7 per cent), affordable housing (4-5 per cent), and two-wheeler loans (2 per cent), while commercial vehicle (CV) loans remain largely unaffected.
The vehicle financing sector is experiencing mixed trends. Demand for light commercial vehicles (LCVs) is improving, while medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs) continue to face muted demand and rising competition.
The
affordable housing finance
sector (AHFCs) is witnessing steady disbursements, though some pricing pressure is emerging due to aggressive competition from larger players.
Post-RBI's 25bps rate cut, PSU banks have lowered home loan rates to 8.1-8.2 per cent, but private banks have yet to follow suit.
Larger housing finance companies (HFCs) with fixed liabilities may experience NIM pressure, making AHFCs a preferred choice due to their better pricing power. Among AHFCs,
Home First Finance
remains a top pick.
While NBFC stocks have declined 3-41 per cent from their six-month peaks, top large retail and auto-focused NBFCs have outperformed the broader market.

"RBI's 8-day VRR auction sees tepid demand, likely due to tenor",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-8-day-vrr-auction-sees-tepid-demand-likely-due-to-tenor/articleshow/119013065.cms,14-03-2025,"The
eight-day variable rate repo
(VRR) auction that the
Reserve Bank of India
conducted on Thursday got bids for less than one-tenth of the notified amount, with treasury executives citing the tenure of the operation as a likely reason for the weak demand.
The RBI offered to infuse Rs 1 lakh crore in the banking system through the VRR auction that would reverse, or be repaid, on March 21, but it received bids for only Rs 9,860 crore. The central bank also conducts daily overnight VRR auctions.
Treasury heads said the auction could have seen more demand if the maturity date were in April, in the new fiscal year.
“There is no difference between borrowing overnight and borrowing for eight days. If I have the flexibility to borrow every day, I will borrow when the need arises and not for eight days,”
Jana Small Finance Bank
’s head of treasury
Gopal Tripathi
told ET. “Plus, this would mature within March; if the reversal date were crossing March, there would have been more demand.”
The RBI has been conducting these auctions to inject liquidity in anticipation of outflows from the banking system due to advance quarterly tax and GST payments.
Live Events
“These steps (to inject liquidity) are pre-emptive ahead of a seasonal squeeze in March, being a fiscal year end, besides other contributing factors including FX market intervention, tax outflows, volatility in capital flows and currency in circulation,” DBS Bank said in a note.
Economists expect an outflow of more than Rs 2 lakh crore due to quarterly advance income tax payment and another Rs 1 lakh crore on GST outflows, according to
IDFC First Bank
.
Daily average liquidity was a deficit of Rs 1.04 lakh crore as on March 12, RBI data showed. This is expected to widen after tax outflows.

RBI urges lenders to create common pool for green projects,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-urges-lenders-to-create-common-pool-for-green-projects/articleshow/118984718.cms,13-03-2025,"Kolkata: The Reserve Bank of India has urged lenders to create a common pool of bankable
green projects
to boost flow of climate-related financing.
The central bank has also proposed to set up a dedicated “on tap” cohort on
climate change risks
and
sustainable finance
under its
Regulatory Sandbox
initiative.
Governor Sanjay Malhotra on Thursday said that the lack of bankable green projects slowed the adequate flow of credit and a collaborative approach could address this constraint.
""Capacity and expertise constraints limit the ability to appraise and thus finance climate change mitigation. It also enhances the risk of funding such projects. Thus, creation of a common pool of such
bankable projects
will have multi-fold benefits for the entire ecosystem,"" Malhotra said at a seminar on climate change risks and finance organised by the central bank in New Delhi.
He stressed upon capacity building and improving technical know-how to better appraise risks in financing projects which use green technologies.
Live Events
Lending to green projects is typically associated with higher credit risk due to borrowers’ use of new and emerging green technologies, which have relatively limited track record in terms of reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness.
""There is a need for collaboration in this emerging and evolving area. I urge the regulated entities to seriously consider setting up such a pool through an appropriate institutional arrangement.""
Sharing of knowledge would benefit all the lenders.
The Indian regulator has also been encouraging innovations through its regulatory sandbox and hackathon initiatives in the Fintech space.
""We propose to set up a dedicated “on tap” cohort on climate change risks and sustainable finance under
RBI
’s Regulatory Sandbox initiative. We are also planning to conduct a special “Greenathon” on climate change and related aspects,"" the Governor said.
Central banks in advanced economies have traditionally followed an asset neutral approach while their counterparts in emerging markets economies have adopted directed lending policies to channelise credit to certain sectors. Back home, the RBI mandates lenders to follow
priority sector lending
guidelines to ensure flow of credit to the targeted areas including
renewable energy
.
RBI has included finance to small renewable energy projects – solar, biomass based, windmills, micro-hydel plants and non-conventional energy based public utilities and remote village electrification projects as part of priority sector lending.
""Our endeavour has been to play the role of a facilitator – including supporting capacity building and fostering a conducive regulatory framework for promoting green and sustainable finance,"" Malhotra said, adding that technology and finance have a critical role in the transition towards a low-carbon economy.

Tamil Nadu
's progressive social policies, robust infrastructure facilities, and large skilled labour force enabled the state to place itself on an elevated economic development trajectory, making the state contribute 9.21 per cent to national GDP in 2023-24, Tamil Nadu's first economic survey 2024-25 said on Thursday. The survey brought out by the State Planning Commission and handed over to Chief Minister M K Stalin, said the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) at current prices reached Rs 27.22 lakh crore in 2023-24, posting a nominal growth rate of 13.71 per cent and a real growth rate of 8.33 per cent.
""Tamil Nadu economy in 2024-25 faced global headwinds with its innate economic strength. The pandemic, coupled with geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events, disrupted global supply chains and triggered crises in the energy and food sectors,"" it said.
The global economy posted a real growth rate of 3.33 percent in 2023. India's economy recorded 7.61 percent growth in 2022-23, 9.19 per cent in 2023-24, and 6.48 per cent in 2024-25.
""Building on a strong foundation of inclusive policies, Tamil Nadu has demonstrated remarkable economic resilience, consistently achieving growth rates of 8 per cent or more since 2021-22, and the state is expected to maintain a growth rate above 8 per cent in 2024-25,"" it said.
In 2022-23, Tamil Nadu's per capita income was Rs 2.78 lakh, 1.6 times the national average of Rs 1.69 lakh. The state consistently outpaced the national average over the years and is the fourth-largest state in per capita income.
Live Events
Tamil Nadu's economic development is more evenly distributed across multiple urban centers. Cities like Coimbatore, Madurai, Tirupur, Tiruchirappalli, and Salem contributed significantly to the state's economy, helping bridge the urban-rural divide.
In 2023-24, the services (tertiary) sector contributed 53.63 per cent of the state's Gross State Value Added (GSVA), followed by the secondary sector (33.37 per cent) and the primary sector (13 per cent). As in developed economies, if the state's secondary sector share increases by about 5 per cent, employment prospects will likely improve further, it stated.
Accelerated growth in agriculture and allied sectors was achievable if Tamil Nadu addressed challenges such as groundwater depletion and climate change. Implementing climate-smart practices, mechanisation, and post-harvest value addition could significantly boost income in these sectors, it said.
Tamil Nadu is an industrial powerhouse, contributing 11.90 per cent to India's manufacturing GDP and leading the nation in the number of factories. With 35.56 lakh Udyam-registered Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Tamil Nadu ranked second nationally in 2023-24.
""Dubbed the 'Detroit of India,' the state houses over 1,500 factories producing automobiles and auto components,"" it said.
The state ranked first in motor vehicle production, wearing apparel, and leather products and second in textiles, machinery, and electronic products. It also leads the country in exporting engineering goods, electronics, ready-made garments, cotton yarn, handloom products, and leather goods. In 2023-24, 33.31 percent of Tamil Nadu's total workforce was engaged in industrial activities, with 15.97 percent in manufacturing and 17.2 percent in construction.
From 2019-20 to 2023-24, total credit to Tamil Nadu's industry through scheduled commercial banks increased from Rs 2.5 lakh crore to Rs 3.01 lakh crore, while Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rose from Rs 5,909 crore to Rs 20,157 crore.
Among major states, Tamil Nadu consistently ranked among the top three in the Credit-Deposit Ratio (CDR), reflecting its high economic activity. The state's CDR increased from 109.2 per cent in 2019-20 to 117.7 per cent in 2023-24, compared to India's rise from 76.5 per cent to 79.6 per cent. Credit to the service sector through scheduled commercial banks grew from Rs 2.86 lakh crore in 2019-20 to Rs 4.46 lakh crore in 2023-24, it said.
Employment generation is crucial for economic growth and social stability. In 2019-20, Tamil Nadu's Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for individuals aged 15-59 years was 63.3 per cent, compared to the all-India average of 56.9 per cent. By 2023-24, it had risen to 64.6 per cent, surpassing the national average of 64.3 per cent.
Between 2005-06 and 2022-23, Tamil Nadu's poverty rate (Headcount Ratio) decreased significantly, from 36.54 per cent to just 1.43 per cent, while India's HCR declined from 55.34 per cent to 11.28 per cent. In 2023-24, Tamil Nadu ranked fourth among major states in terms of average monthly per capita consumption expenditure for both rural and urban areas, consistent with its position as the fourth highest in annual per capita income.

""As on September 30, 2024, EWS and LIG accounted for 39 per cent, MIG accounted for 44 per cent and HIG accounted for 17 per cent of outstanding individual housing loans,"" the report said.
It further said individual housing loan

during the half year ended September 2024 were Rs 4.10 lakh crore while disbursements during the year ended March 2024 were Rs 9.07 lakh crore.

housing credit
, performance of
Housing Finance Companies
(HFCs) and outlook for the sector.
""Major initiatives of GoI, such as PMAY-G, PMAY-U, impact assessment of PMAY-U, Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF), Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHC) scheme, etc. have been covered in the report,"" it said.

It also said the outlook for the housing sector remains promising, driven by budget announcements on PMAY 2.0, urbanisation, transit-oriented development, digitisation and other factors.
The report further said housing finance companies (HFCs) have played a pivotal role in the Indian housing sector by catering to the diverse needs of homebuyers.
Owing to their flexible eligibility criteria, robust customer service, efficient documentation, and reduced processing time, HFCs have secured their place in the Indian financial landscape.
""While the housing sector has shown strong growth, regional disparities in credit flow remain a significant challenge for HFCs with Southern, Western, and Northern states account for the bulk of housing finance disbursements while there is low penetration of credit flow in the eastern and northeastern regions,"" the NHB said.
Similarly, the penetration of branch network for HFCs is less in northeastern regions of the country.
NHB said efforts to address regional disparities in housing finance are ongoing.
The government and regulators are working to increase mortgage penetration in underserved areas, with initiatives like the co-lending model aiming to combine the liquidity of banks with the reach of HFCs to extend housing credit to underserved populations.

""With about three crucial weeks to go, it may go up to ₹66,000-67,000 crore this fiscal if all goes well, way above the revised estimate of ₹55,000 crore,"" he said. The collection had hit a record ₹63,749 crore in 2023-24.
The entities include all the non-financial
central public sector enterprises
(CPSEs) and those in which the government holds minority stakes.
Higher dividend would offset any potential shortfall in the Centre's miscellaneous receipts, which include disinvestment and monetisation, from the revised estimate of ₹33,000 crore for this fiscal.
Live Events
Petroleum Cos Leading
The mop-up from disinvestment alone stands at just ₹8,625 crore so far this fiscal. State-run firms in the petroleum, coal and power sectors have accounted for more than 67% of the total dividend mop-up so far this fiscal.
Petroleum firms alone have coughed up ₹21,443 crore, while coal and power sector companies have paid ₹10,402 crore and ₹8,369 crore, respectively.
This would be the fifth straight year when such dividend revenue would beat the revised annual estimate.
Strong profits recorded by CPSEs and the government's 2020 policy for them to cough up regular dividends after setting aside capital for growth are boosting the mop-up in recent years, said the official.
Outlook for FY26
The government has budgeted ₹69,000 crore in dividend from these entities for 2025-26. It expects robust profitability, especially among its petroleum companies, due to an anticipated moderation in global oil prices. CPSEs in the power and coal sectors are also expected to rake in good profits in the next fiscal as well.
Global oil prices are falling in the wake of US President Donald Trump's focus on further drilling and raising output amid a slowdown in Chinese demand.
Already, crude prices dropped to a three-year low below $70 a barrel last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies decided to go ahead with a planned output increase in April.

"Govt seeks House nod for extra ₹51,463 cr spending",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/govt-seeks-house-nod-for-extra-51463-cr-spending/articleshow/118857543.cms,11-03-2025,"New Delhi: The government Monday sought parliamentary approval for an additional net expenditure of ₹51,463 crore in the second and final batch of supplementary demands for grants for the current fiscal, on top of the ₹44,143 crore approved in the first batch in December last year.
Despite the extra expenditure, the government expects to contain its
fiscal deficit
at the revised estimate level of 4.8% of gross domestic product (GDP), partly because
nominal GDP
is estimated to be way above the initial projection.
The second batch of demands involves gross additional spending of ₹678,508 crore this fiscal. However, about ₹627,045 crore of it will be met through savings of various ministries and departments or by enhanced receipts and recoveries, according to the papers tabled in Parliament.
The government's total expenditure for the current fiscal was budgeted at ₹48.21 lakh crore but it was trimmed marginally in the revised estimate to ₹47.16 lakh crore following an anticipated slowdown in capital spending.
Live Events
Even the tax and non-tax revenue was marginally cut to ₹30.88 lakh crore in the revised estimate for this fiscal from the budgeted ₹31.29 lakh crore.
The latest supplementary demands comprise a total of 52 grants and three appropriations.
The government also presented demands for excess grants for expenditure relating to 2021-22 amounting to ₹1,291 crore.
As for the current fiscal, a large part of the proposed net cash outgo in the second batch includes extra spending requirements of the fertiliser ministry (₹14,100 crore), the
finance ministry
(₹13,449 crore) and defence pension (₹8,476 crore).
Icra
chief economist Aditi Nayar said savings in other expenditure heads and a sharp upward revision in FY25 GDP estimate would provide the government the cushion to keep its fiscal deficit ratio at the targeted level.
The nominal GDP estimate for FY25 has been revised upwards by about 2.1 percentage points to 9.9% in the second advance estimate from the first one.
Nayar, in fact, expected the fiscal deficit to touch 4.7% of GDP in FY25, lower than the revised estimate of 4.8%.
The net outgo under the two batches of supplementary demands for grants for the current fiscal is lower than a year before, when the government had sought clearance for a net spending of ₹1.37 lakh crore, indicating more realistic budget calculations this time.

Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the Central Government and GSTN have taken various steps to improve compliance and prevent tax evasions, including providing intelligence inputs, detecting fraudulent registration, and suspicious e-way bill activity and selection of returns for scrutiny and selection of taxpayers for audit based on various risk parameters.
""These measures are helpful in safeguarding the revenue and nabbing the evaders. Certain projects were also undertaken such as 'Project Anveshan' (Analytics, Verification, Shortlisting of Anomalies) whereby newer techniques like Facial Recognition System (FRS), E-way bill data etc. were used for early identification of GSTINs with propensity for fake/ fraudulent activity to generate Intelligence reports,"" Chaudhary said.

India set to overcome worst cash crunch in years on RBI steps,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-set-to-overcome-worst-cash-crunch-in-years-on-rbi-steps/articleshow/118782088.cms,07-03-2025,"India is heading toward plugging one of the worst-ever liquidity deficits in the financial system, following aggressive steps by the central bank to inject cash.
The liquidity shortfall, measured through lenders’ borrowings from the central bank, has eased to 793 billion rupees ($9 billion) as of March 6, from a nearly 15-year high of 3.3 trillion rupees in late January, a Bloomberg Economics index showed.
Much of the shrinkage was driven by the
Reserve Bank of India
as its measures since end-January will take the cash infusion to about $68 billion. Improving cash conditions will help in better transmission of interest-rate cuts and support the economy as it heads for its slowest expansion in four years.

“The RBI’s latest measures indicate that its focus is on making system liquidity positive to enable transmission of rate cuts,” said Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist,
IDFC First Bank Ltd.
There will likely be a liquidity surplus by March-end, she said, adding the
RBI
has room to pump in 2 trillion rupees of cash in the fiscal year starting April 1.

India’s liquidity deficit widened partly due to dollar sales by the central bank to shield the rupee from global headwinds as the local currency hit successive lows. The banking system is now bracing for cash outflows due to quarterly advance tax payments by companies to the government before the financial year-end in March.
The measures taken by the RBI this year to provide cash to lenders include auction-based open market bond purchases, variable rate repurchase operations and foreign exchange swaps. It will buy more bonds this month and conduct a forex swap.
The cash infusions have helped bring banks’ overnight borrowing rate to below the policy rate in the last couple of days, while two-year government bond yields have eased. The overnight rate was almost 40 basis points above the RBI’s policy rate in early January.
The additional measures announced by the central bank this week were “far more in size” than market expectations, Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at Bandhan AMC Ltd., wrote in a note. This suggests that the RBI will inject more funds if liquidity conditions do not ease as expected, he said.

"Increase share of states in Central taxes pool to 48%, MP CM tells 16th Finance Commission",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/increase-share-of-states-in-central-taxes-pool-to-48-mp-cm-tells-16th-finance-commission/articleshow/118764322.cms,06-03-2025,"Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister
Mohan Yadav
on Thursday asked the
16th Finance Commission
to increase the share of states in the
Central taxes
pool from the current 44 per cent to 48 per cent to ensure the nation's development. Developed India cannot be built without a developed Madhya Pradesh, Yadav said while addressing a meeting with the chairperson and members of 16th Central Finance Commission at Kushabhau Thackeray International Convention Centre in Bhopal.
""The strength of the nation lies in the strength of the states. Therefore, the share of the states in Central taxes and revenue receipts, i.e. grants, must be increased. By getting more financial grants from the Union government, the states will be able to achieve their long-term goals in the short term,"" the CM said.
Asserting that MP was progressing rapidly in the fields of agriculture, infrastructure, education, health, forest, tourism, urban development and industrial development, he said strong financial support/grants are required from the Central government for further development in these areas.
""We will fulfil the resolution of developed Madhya Pradesh. Right now the state's budget is about Rs 3.5 lakh crore. We aim to double it in the next five years,"" he said while highlighting the state government's work alongside Rajasthan in the Parvati-Kalisindh-Chambal river linking project and Maharashtra government on the Tapti River Project.
""The Union government has allocated Rs 90,000 crore for the Parvati-Kalisindh-ChambalNational River Linking Project. Similarly, we have moved ahead with the Uttar Pradesh government for the Ken-Betwa Link National Project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed bhumi pujan for both projects. Twenty years ago, only 7 lakh hectares of agricultural land was irrigated in MP. This figure is now 48 lakh hectares,"" Yadav said.

Due to policies of the state government, farmers are taking up organised farming in a major way, he said at the meeting with the Finance Commission. Referring to the recent Global Investors Summit (GIS) and Regional Industries Conclave (RIC), Yadav said investors were coming to MP due to the government's 18 new industrial policies.
""MP has received investment proposals worth Rs 30.77 lakh crore through RIC and GIS. This is a symbol of increasing trust in us. We are creating industry cells in every collectorate, due to which investors will not face any difficulty even at the district level. We are making trade and business easier in the state,"" Yadav said.
He also said efforts are on to ensure MP produces more than 20 per cent of the country's milk, which will bring prosperity to farmers and those rearing cattle. ""The MP government will give solar pumps to all 30 lakh farmers in the next three years. With this, our farmers will become energy providers along with food providers. Our government is going to give electricity connection to farmers for just Rs 5,"" he added.
The CM also highlighted new initiatives, including an air ambulance service that has helped airlift critical patients to big hospitals. Yadav submitted a memorandum on behalf of his government to the Finance Commission during the meeting.

State governments generally pay a premium above central government bonds yields as they are quasi-sovereign in nature.
WHY ITS IMPORTANT
State governments are responsible for a considerable share of total government spending, which has led to an increase in borrowing over the last few years.
Heavy state borrowing would also increase the country's overall debt-to-GDP (
gross domestic product
) ratio, though the federal government is adhering to fiscal prudence with lower targets for fiscal deficit and borrowing.
Long-term investors
such as insurance companies, provident funds and pension funds are major investors for state debt, and due to heavy supply from states, their demand for 30- and 50-year central government bonds has eased.
New Delhi has been targeting a bulk of their borrowing through such ultra-long bonds.
KEY QUOTE
""States are likely to borrow despite the comfortable cash position given inclination to fully utilize borrowing limits, but funding can be correspondingly lower at start of next fiscal,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, senior economist at
ICICI Securities Primary Dealership
.
""At the same time as state
debt supply
has picked up, there could be some concerns on the demand side that may be weighing on sentiment.""
GRAPHIC
WHAT'S NEXT
Market participants anticipate the spreads to widen further as more supply from states in anticipated. They are scheduled to sell debt worth an additional 1.35 trillion rupees in the last three weeks of March, with traders anticipating the actual supply to outpace the calendar.

India's declining household savings amid reduced FDI is big concern: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-declining-household-savings-amid-reduced-fdi-is-big-concern-report/articleshow/118641919.cms,01-03-2025,"India's savings rate, while not alarming, is not as strong as it should be, especially considering the country's low
foreign direct investment
(
FDI
) inflows, according to a report by Blume Research.
The report stated that a closer look at savings trends reveals that the biggest concern lies in household financial savings, which have been declining sharply due to a surge in financial liabilities, primarily unsecured personal loans.
It said, ""A high savings rate is necessary given low FDI rates. A deep dive into savings illustrates that the culprit is financial savings (as opposed to physical savings), and the reason is rise in financial liabilities, chiefly led by rising (unsecured) personal loans"".
The report highlighted that while India's overall savings rate appears stable, household savings-the largest contributor-have been falling over the years.
The data in the report pointed out that in FY00 (Year 2000),
household savings
accounted for 84 per cent of the total savings in the economy, but this share has now dropped to just 61 per cent in FY23.
Live Events
A major reason for this decline mentioned by the report is the drop in household financial savings, which fell from 10.1 per cent of GDP in FY00 (Year 2000) to just 5 per cent in FY23. At the same time, financial liabilities have risen sharply from 2 per cent to 5.8 per cent of GDP over the same period.
A significant portion of household debt is now non-housing debt, which is higher in India compared to many other economies.
The report added that this rise in debt is largely driven by a sharp increase in consumer loans. According to the report, the share of consumer loans in total credit has surged from 21 per cent in FY16 to 34 per cent in FY24. In contrast, the share of industry loans has declined from 42 per cent in FY16 to 34 per cent in FY24.
One of the key reasons behind this growing indebtedness is the rise of Small Ticket Personal Loans (STPL), which are mostly unsecured and easy to obtain.
The report noted that non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), including fintech firms, have become the primary source of these loans, often disbursing them digitally. Unlike traditional banks, these lenders offer quick access to credit, making borrowing easier but also increasing household financial liabilities.
The findings raise concerns about the sustainability of India's savings and debt levels. With a higher proportion of income going toward repaying loans, household savings could continue to shrink, potentially affecting long-term economic stability.

Assam received Rs 5.18 lakh crore investment proposals in biz summit: CM Himanta Biswa Sarma,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/assam-received-rs-5-18-lakh-crore-investment-proposals-in-biz-summit-cm-himanta/articleshow/118627493.cms,28-02-2025,"A total investment commitment of Rs 5,18,205 crore was received at the recently concluded
Advantage Assam 2.0
Investment and Infrastructure Summit, Chief Minister
Himanta Biswa Sarma
said on Friday. The commitments amount to 80 per cent of the state's gross domestic product (GDP), which is projected to reach Rs 6.43 lakh crore by March, Sarma said at a press conference here.
""We will begin analysing the proposals in the new financial year, and over the next six months, we will prepare a roadmap for their implementation,"" he said.
A detailed agreement will be signed after thoroughly studying the proposals to ensure their successful execution, he added.
""It is not necessary that all MoUs will translate into investments. The usual success rate of implementation is around 50 per cent, but I am hopeful for 80 per cent, which would make Assam one of the leading states in the country,"" Sarma added.
Providing land for projects and offering incentives are expected to be major challenges in the implementation process. However, ""we will work towards mitigating these challenges over time,"" he assured.
Live Events
Sarma said the overwhelming response to the summit took place because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal to industrialists to invest in Assam.

"GST will be more efficient with fewer exemptions, slabs: IMF's Harald Finger",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-will-be-more-efficient-with-fewer-exemptions-slabs-imfs-harald-finger/articleshow/118611150.cms,28-02-2025,"New Delhi: India is somewhat of an outlier with a complex goods and services tax structure, considering that around two-thirds of countries with a GST have only one or two non-zero rates, said Harald Finger, assistant director and mission chief for the India, Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Reducing the number of non-zero rates and cutting down on exemptions would make the
indirect tax
regime more efficient, he said.
""A single GST rate applied on a broad base can improve compliance, facilitate enforcement, and reduce the risk of evasion (for example, from misclassifying the good or service to take advantage of a lower GST rate). Higher rates for demerit and luxury products can be maintained, ideally through an excise tax,"" Finger told ET in an interview. The IMF in its Article IV report has made a case for rebuilding fiscal buffers through revenue augmentation.
Moreover, he noted, since the introduction of GST, changes to the rate structure have eroded the effective GST rate, and this erosion should be reversed.
He said vulnerable households can be compensated for any increase in their cost of living through increased transfers using the existing direct benefit transfer mechanism.
India rolled out GST in July 2017, subsuming several central and state indirect levies with a four-slab structure and special rates for some goods such as precious metals. Some sin goods also attract a cess.
Live Events
The revenue-neutral rate for GST has fallen to about 11.6% because of several exemptions and reduction in tax rates from about 15.5% at the time of roll out. The
GST Council
, which is the apex decision-making body for the indirect tax, has tasked a group of ministers to look at rationalisation of the tax structure but there has been little headway on this.
India can further strengthen its growth potential, even in the context of external headwinds, by advancing its structural reform agenda, Finger said.
On getting states on board to undertake crucial reforms, he said, beyond fiscal tools, there is a need for coordination with states to advance structural reforms.
""The union government can play a convenor role in setting up a framework for discussion of reforms and providing technical assistance to states,"" he said, citing examples of GST Council, the Conference of State Finance Secretaries convened by the Reserve Bank of India, and the ongoing development of state-level regulations of the new labour codes coordinated by Ministry of Labour.
On India's financial system, he said, systemic financial risks are broadly contained, but further reform and vigilant supervision are needed to address remaining pockets of vulnerability.
""Concentrated exposures of non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) remain a vulnerability,"" he said, adding that stress tests have shown that some banks, especially public sector banks, would benefit from building more capital to ensure they have the capacity to continue providing credit also in the face of adverse shocks.
""We recommend that exemptions for state-owned NBFCs from large exposure limits should be eliminated to level the playing field with their private sector counterparts,"" he added.
On exchange rate, he said India has the necessary strength in economic fundamentals and policy frameworks to let the exchange rate move more. ""For instance, exposure by Indian companies to foreign currency debt is low, the RBI's flexible inflation targeting framework is well established, and the foreign exchange market is generally deep and liquid. With this, the exchange rate can be allowed to move more, and thereby play an important role as a shock absorber in the face of external shocks,"" he added.

"India's GST collections surge in January 2025: gross up 12.3%, net rises 10.9%: NCAER report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-gst-collections-surge-in-january-2025-gross-up-12-3-net-rises-10-9-ncaer-report/articleshow/118602517.cms,27-02-2025,"GST
collections, gross and net, achieved robust double-digit growth of 12.3 per cent and 10.9 per cent respectively in January 2025, as compared to subdued growth of 7.3 per cent and 3.3 per cent in December 2024, according to
NCAER
monthly review.
PMI for manufacturing increased to 57.7 in January, signalling expansion while PMI for services remained at an elevated level of 56.5.
NCAER Director General Dr Poonam Gupta said, ""Moderation in inflation (headline inflation to 4.3 per cent) has opened up more policy space. The agriculture sector is also exhibiting much-needed resilience, which bodes well for both inflation control and rural push to the economy.""
As of February 4, Rabi sowing for the 2024-25 season reached 104 per cent of the normal sown area while areas sown under rice and pulses reached 101.2 per cent and 100.3 per cent of the normal sown area respectively.
Growth rate of bank credit, however, remained subdued at 11.2 per cent in December 2024, compared to 20.2 per cent in December 2023. Credit from banks to NBFCs too decelerated from 15 per cent in December 2023 to 6.7 per cent in December 2024.
Live Events
""Credit from NBFCs being important sources of consumer finance and finance for the SME sector, such subdued credit growth rates could further weigh on the economy's growth rate,"" said Dr Gupta.
In this context, she welcomed the recent restoration of risk weight on the exposures of Scheduled Commercial Banks to NBFCs.
The NCAER DG said another factor that needs to be monitored is the continued outflow of FII flows.
""Empirical studies show that FII flows are driven more by external factors than by domestic ones, and hence are quite volatile in nature. As in the past, the current phase of reversal of FII flows from India is a global phenomenon and is associated with reversals from many other emerging markets,"" she said.
Dr Gupta said that in order to attract more stable external funding, it would be desirable to prioritize FDI over FII inflows.
Besides ensuring stable financing, FDI flows enable more direct access to global technology and markets. ""Perhaps it would, therefore, make sense to accord priority to FDI inflows from the US in the ongoing discussions with the Trump Administration,"" she said.

Modi govt seeking to cut states' share of Central taxes from 2026?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-seeks-to-cut-states-share-of-federal-taxes-from-2026-sources-say/articleshow/118597660.cms,27-02-2025,"The Modi govt is seeking to cut the central tax revenues that states receive, three sources with the direct knowledge of the matter said.
The suggestion will be made to the constitutionally-appointed
Finance Commission of India
, which makes recommendations on tax sharing along with other aspects of federal-state fiscal relations, and could lead to a flaring of tensions between the two tiers of government.
The panel, headed by economist Arvind Panagariya, will submit its recommendations by October 31 to be implemented from fiscal year 2026-27. The recommendations are binding.
The Central government will recommend the share of
taxes
going to states be reduced to at least 40% from the current 41%, said one of the sources.
The proposal is likely to be cleared by the cabinet of ministers headed by Modi by the end of March and then be sent to the Finance Commission, said a second of the sources.
Live Events
A 1% swing in the states share of tax revenues could give the federal government about Rs 35,000 crore, based on the expected tax collections for the current year. The final number will vary based on the individual year's tax collections.
An email sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Finance Commission did not get any response.
The share of taxes going to the state governments has jumped from 20% in 1980 to 41% now. But spending requirements for the federal government, particularly in years of economic slowdown, have increased, the first source said.
This has led to calls for a lower share of tax revenues going to states, the sources said.
The Centre's fiscal deficit is estimated at 4.8% of gross domestic product for 2024-25, while the states have a fiscal deficit of 3.2% of the national GDP.
States have a share of over 60% in total government spending in the economy and typically spend more on social infrastructure like health and education while the federal government's spending is more focused on physical infrastructure.
However, the states have limited discretion in raising revenue since the implementation of the national Goods and Services Tax in July 2017.
The Central government since the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the share of cesses and surcharges, which are not shared with the states, to over 15% of the gross tax revenue from 9%-12% earlier.
A shift in resources available to the states could lead to changes in spending priorities.
The federal government is also likely to suggest ways to discourage states from giving cash handouts, debt waivers and other so-called freebies by the states for political gains, one of the sources said.
One way to do this would be to link federal grants given to states to make up the shortfall in state tax revenue to meeting certain conditions, the source said, adding that only after meeting those conditions will the states be eligible for such grants.
It was not immediately clear whether federal government would deny grants to states seen as offering freebies.
In the last five years, these revenue-deficit grants have declined from Rs 1.18 lakh crore ($13.61 billion) in 2021/22 to Rs 13,700 crore ($1.58 billion) estimated in the budget for 2025/26.

India needs 1.2-1.5 tax buoyancy to achieve 6.5-7pc growth: EY,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-needs-1-2-1-5-tax-buoyancy-to-achieve-6-5-7pc-growth-ey/articleshow/118574795.cms,26-02-2025,"India has to maintain a tax buoyancy in the range of 1.2-1.5 to achieve a growth of 6.5-7 per cent, a EY report said on Wednesday. The report also said that the government may need to strengthen revenue mobilisation, particularly by increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio from the estimated 12 per cent in FY26 (Budget Estimates) to 14 per cent by FY31.
India's fiscal strategy must focus on enhancing tax buoyancy, prudent expenditure management, and continued structural reforms to ensure sustainable growth, EY said.
""EY India Chief Policy Advisor D K Srivastava said the FY26 budget strategically balances fiscal consolidation with growth imperatives.
""However, for India to achieve a medium-term growth trajectory of 6.5-7.0 per cent and realize its
Viksit Bharat
vision, it must ensure tax buoyancy remains in the 1.2-1.5 range. This would help create the necessary fiscal room to accelerate infrastructure expansion, enhance social sector spending, and maintain fiscal discipline,"" Srivastava added.
The EY India Economy Watch report noted that over the past three years, gross
tax revenue
buoyancy has gently moderated, from 1.4 in FY24 to 1.15 in FY25 (RE) and projected to be 1.07 in FY26(BE). ""Maintaining tax buoyancy in the 1.2-1.5 range could help the Government of India achieve 6.5-7.0 per cent GDP growth,"" the EY Report said.
Live Events
Indian economy is projected to grow in the range of 6.3-6.8 per cent in the next fiscal. In the current fiscal, the GDP growth is estimated to be 6.4 per cent.
EY report further said that over the past decade, the government has reduced its
fiscal deficit
to GDP ratio from 4.1 per cent in FY15 to 3.4 per cent in FY19, with the ratio expected to adjust to 4.4 per cent by FY26. It needs to be steadily reduced to the FRBM consistent level of 3 per cent, it added.

NRI
) bank accounts rose sharply by 42.8% to $13.33 billion between April and December 2024, compared to $9.33 billion in the same period last year, according to the latest data from the
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
).
The total outstanding
NRI deposits
stood at $161.8 billion at the end of December 2024, up from $146.9 billion in December 2023. NRI deposit schemes comprise foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) deposits, non-resident external (NRE) deposits, and non-resident ordinary (NRO) deposits, which are held in rupees.
The highest inflows were recorded in FCNR(B) deposits, which attracted $6.46 billion during the April-December 2024 period, nearly doubling from $3.45 billion in the same period last year. The outstanding amount in FCNR(B) accounts increased to $32.19 billion by the end of December. These accounts allow NRIs to maintain fixed deposits in freely convertible foreign currencies for one to five years, protecting their funds from currency fluctuations.
NRE deposits
saw inflows of $3.57 billion, up from $2.91 billion a year earlier. Outstanding NRE deposits totaled $99.56 billion in December 2024. Meanwhile,
NRO deposits
recorded inflows of $3.29 billion, compared to $2.97 billion in the previous year. The total outstanding amount in NRO deposits reached $30.04 billion in December.
In early December, the RBI raised the interest rate ceiling on FCNR(B) deposits to enable banks to offer higher returns, aiming to attract more foreign currency inflows and support the rupee against the US dollar.

Uttar Pradesh Budget
2025-26, with a substantial total size of Rs 8,08,736 crore, was presented by state Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna in the assembly on February 20. Key focus areas in the budget for the year include strong commitment to research and development as well as Information Technology.
In his budget speech, Khanna announced that 22 per cent of the budget is earmarked for developmental initiatives, 13 per cent for education, 11 per cent for agriculture and associated services, and six per cent for health care.
""Our focus has been on fostering research, development, and Information Technology throughout this budget,"" Khanna stated.
In his address, Khanna commended Chief Minister
Yogi Adityanath
for his leadership and the various advancements witnessed in the state. He also referenced the ongoing Maha Kumbh, underscoring its significance not only as a cultural and religious event but also as a unique astronomical phenomenon that represents India's ancient traditions and cultural unity.
Khanna noted that the total budget outlay for the 2025-26 financial year reflects a 9.8 per cent increase compared to the previous fiscal year's budget. For the fiscal year 2024-25, the budget was Rs 7,36,437 crore, which included new initiatives totaling Rs 24,863.57 crore.

Additionally, the minister announced plans for the development of an Artificial Intelligence City and the establishment of a research park dedicated to Cyber Security.
The budget also includes provisions for the modernisation of the Legislative Assembly and the enhancement of smart classrooms and laboratories in schools and polytechnic institutions.
Uttar Pradesh Budget 2025: Some of the key highlights

New Income Tax Bill 2025 – New ray of hope!,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/new-income-tax-bill-2025-new-ray-of-hope/articleshow/118240488.cms,14-02-2025,"The much awaited new income-tax bill has been tabled before the Lok Sabha and is likely to be implemented from 1 April 2026 once it receives necessary approvals. As highlighted by the Finance Minister in her budget speech earlier this month on 1st February, the new income-tax bill is expected to be clear and direct and easy to understand for both the taxpayers and the tax authorities. This aims to reduce litigation and enhance tax certainty by trusting the taxpayers.
While the new income-tax bill is not expected to bring in any major changes in terms of provisions of law, monetary thresholds and timelines, the legislative text has been simplified to make it more understandable and easier to comprehend. For instance, the phrase ‘notwithstanding anything contained’ is proposed to be replaced by ‘irrespective of anything contained’ to make it easier for the taxpayer to read and understand the law. As per the draft income-tax bill, the provisions of law have been streamlined in simpler pointers to replace several provisions (about 1200) and explanations (about 900) in the existing law.
This was much needed because there have been several updates and changes in various provisions over the years which made the final legislation rather complicated. The new income-tax bill also has several tabulated presentations of various deductions and exemptions and formula to derive the required values, which, under the current law, were mentioned in complicated text format spread over different sections and rules, making it difficult for taxpayers to understand.
Areas like salary perquisites, presumptive taxation, and withholding tax provisions (TDS/ TCS) should now become easier to understand. Wherever the sections have detailed or multiple sub-sections in the current law, these have been shifted to distinct schedules.
The proposed bill replaces the terms ‘previous year’, ‘financial year’ and ‘assessment year’ with a single nomenclature i.e. ‘tax year’ to remove confusion in interpreting the timelines provided for various compliances both for the taxpayers and tax authorities. There has been no change in the timelines to file
income tax
returns and the tax slabs and tax rates applicable to the individuals. Interestingly, the new income-tax bill continues the option to opt for old tax regime, which many expected to have a sunset clause given the government’s focus on sweetening the new tax regime since its introduction.
Live Events
This implies that various exemptions and deductions available under the old tax regime to reduce ones’ taxable income have been carried forward in the new income-tax bill. This would provide an opportunity to the taxpayers to analyse which regime is more beneficial for them and does not forcefully impose the selection of new tax regime which is sans the incentive of exemptions and deductions.
The government has been making efforts to rationalise the withholding tax provisions. To improve ease of paying taxes, the Bill proposes that a taxpayer can apply for lower withholding tax certificate under all TDS/TCS provisions instead of only a select few, as in the current law. It is an important step to reduce compliance for taxpayers at large.
The new income-tax bill has also incorporated the changes of Budget 2024 which were enacted and the proposed changes of Budget 2025 to provide a wholesome legislature.
The new bill also contains provisions to allow a smooth transition to the new law, for instance, continuing with the pending proceedings. The Bill would be examined by the Parliamentary Committee, and it is hoped that consultations will be held with the stakeholders.
All in all, the new income-tax bill lives up to the intent of the government to simplify the language and bring more clarity in provisions which have been marred with complexity of technical jargon, especially with multiple changes in law over the years. Once passed, the new bill is expected to reduce litigation by providing a clearer framework for compliance and administration and help save resources of the taxpayers and the tax authorities.

"Gujarat, Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra may have crack the debt code",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gujarat-odisha-west-bengal-and-maharashtra-may-have-crack-the-debt-code/articleshow/118211368.cms,13-02-2025,"Only four states—Gujarat, Odisha, West Bengal, and Maharashtra—have reduced their
debt-to-GSDP ratio
, while Punjab and Tamil Nadu have seen the sharpest increases, according to a paper by economists.
The study, authored by NCAER economist Barry Eichengreen and the agency’s chief Poonam Gupta, who is also a member of the advisory council to the 16th Finance Commission, estimates that Punjab and possibly Rajasthan could see their debt-to-GSDP levels exceed 50% by 2027-28. This highlights the need for focused action to address the rising debt burden.
The paper calls for a reassessment of the Finance Commission’s role. ""Finance Commissions have not been asked to consider overall fiscal prudence when recommending allocations. The horizontal devolution (state-wise) of taxes among states... does not provide incentives for fiscal rectitude. Perversely, Finance Commissions are mandated to allocate more resources to states with larger revenue deficits, which is an obvious source of moral hazard and a mechanism through which errant states are subsidised,"" it said.
India has the highest subnational debt as a percentage of GDP among BRICS countries and the highest as a share of revenue of any country.
A third of India’s total public debt is attributed to the states, a significant fraction compared to other federal economies. Over the past decade, half of India's larger states have added more than 10 percentage points to their debt-to-GSDP ratios. Of the rest, some have exercised fiscal discipline, while others have recorded moderate increases in debt.
Live Events
The recommendations come at a time when political parties across states are distributing subsidies and welfare schemes while also managing committed expenditures such as salaries, pensions, and interest payments, which are difficult to reduce.
The study suggests room for a fiscal ""grand bargain,"" where heavily indebted states with poor financial prospects could receive some debt relief in exchange for conceding greater central government oversight and a temporary reduction in fiscal autonomy. The paper proposes that a portion of these states’ debt could be transferred to the central government’s
balance sheet
in return for stricter fiscal discipline measures.
States account for nearly a third of India’s total debt, with the Centre responsible for the rest. The paper recommends the creation of independent fiscal councils in the states to assess the realism of spending and revenue projections. It also calls for a forensic analysis to identify specific revenue shortfalls or excessive expenditure that have contributed to rising deficits in the worst-performing states.
To strengthen revenue mobilisation, the study suggests states improve digitalisation and administrative processes, broaden the tax base, increase property tax, introduce new taxes, and boost privatisation receipts. It also recommends shifting spending priorities towards infrastructure and capacity-building investments.
The Union government, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and the Finance Commission should work together to enforce fiscal discipline in the states, the paper said.
""The RBI should review its policies of intervening in the markets to cap spreads on the bonds of heavily indebted states. Limiting such intervention would strengthen market discipline,"" the paper said.
The study acknowledges concerns that treating states differently in terms of borrowing costs may be resisted and that there is a risk of financial contagion, where the bonds of weaker states impact those of fiscally stable ones.
It also urges state governments to recognise the risks posed by contingent liabilities and to introduce institutional reforms that improve forecasting and the execution of debt management strategies.

West Bengal achieved growth through fiscal discipline: Economic Review,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/west-bengal-achieved-growth-through-fiscal-discipline-economic-review/articleshow/118182055.cms,12-02-2025,"The Economic Review for 2024-25 presented by the West Bengal government in the assembly on Wednesday said that the state had achieved growth over the years through fiscal discipline. The review said that in the last 13 years, the West Bengal economy has witnessed tremendous growth.
The size of the economy, measured in terms of nominal gross state domestic product (GSDP) has reached a level of Rs 18,15,010 crore in 2024-25. In the same fiscal, the state economy is estimated to grow by 6.80 per cent in real terms.
According to the review, fiscal health of the state has improved impressively in the last 13 years.
The state's own tax revenue collection has risen by more than four times between 2010-11 to 2023-24. On the other hand, capital expenditure has been consistently increasing since 2011-12.
Also, government spending on agriculture and allied sector, rural development and social welfare schemes has increased enormously, the review said.
Live Events
On account of effective fiscal consolidation measures, the total debt of the state as a percentage of GSDP has shown a consistent decreasing trend.
Revenue deficit as a percentage of total revenue receipt has reduced from 36.55 per cent in 2010-11 to 12.83 per cent in 2023-24, it said.
The fiscal deficit of the state has also shown a steady decrease over the last few years.
The review also said that the aim of the state government is to ensure a decent standard of living for all people across different sections of the society.
Empowering women has always been a priority for the state government in the last 13 years. 'Lakshmir Bhandar', a financial assistance scheme for women, is the pioneering project of the state government to provide a basic monthly income to 2.21 crore women in the state.
Over the last 13 years, there has been significant growth in industrial output in West Bengal. The state has become a favourite destination for investors, both foreign and domestic, the review said.

"Karnataka draws investment proposals worth $115 billion, spokesperson says",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/karnataka-draws-investment-proposals-worth-115-billion-spokesperson-says/articleshow/118151812.cms,11-02-2025,"Karnataka
has received investment proposals worth nearly Rs 10 lakh crore ($115.31 billion), a government spokesperson said, as the country tries to bolster its manufacturing sector and generate jobs in a slowing economy.
The proposed investments would focus on areas such as renewable energy, steel, semiconductors and automobiles, the spokesperson said at the '
Invest Karnataka
' event on Tuesday.
To be sure, not all proposals have been confirmed and the government has not provided a timeline for these investments.
The state government aims to implement at least 70% of proposals, up from 40% to 50% after the event's 2022 edition, the New Indian Express newspaper reported last week, citing a state minister.
Companies that have pledged investments included India's
Mahindra and Mahindra
and JSW Group, Germany's
Bosch
, Japan's Toyota Motor and Taiwan-based Foxconn.

Karnataka, which includes the IT hub of Bengaluru, is among the top contributors to India's economy and is a major exporter of software, IT services and manufactured goods.
The investment commitments also come amid New Delhi's push to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce imports as it looks to take advantage of Sino-U.S. tensions that have led companies such as Apple to diversify their manufacturing operations away from China..
Inaugurating the event, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said India's growing economy and strong consumption make it an investment target, with recent moves like a personal income tax cut set to fuel demand.
The JSW Group, whose business spans industries including cement, steel, paints and energy, will invest Rs 1.2 lakh crore ($13.84 billion) to expand its operations in the state, Chairman and Managing Director Sajjan Jindal said.
Mahindra, which already has a strong presence in Karnataka, plans to invest nearly Rs 40,0oo crore in the state($4.61 billion) over the next few years, chairman Anand Mahindra said at the event.

Trump
kicked off his tariffs policy by with China, Canada and Mexico and later announced 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries. He said on Monday that he would announce plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on other countries over the next two days. In view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to the US and possibility of a trade deal between the two countries, India has so far escaped Trump's tariffs. Yet they have already started hurting India.
The exodus of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) that gathered pace with Trump's victory seems to have quickened by his muscular trade policy, roiling the Indian stock markets.
Indian benchmark indices closed lower for the fifth straight session on Tuesday, with the
Sensex
tumbling over 1,000 points and the Nifty50 slipping below 23,100. The total
market
capitalization of BSE-listed companies shrank by Rs 9.3 lakh crore to Rs 408.52 lakh crore.
""The ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policies and tariffs, coupled with domestic economic growth concerns and persistent selling by FIIs, is dampening market sentiment,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at

'America First' speeding up 'quit India' movement by FIIs?
Trump tariffs are a leading cause of huge dips in
Indian stock market
. Trump's America First policy is said to have spurred the FIIs which were already exiting India due to various other reasons such as a strengthening dollar, high US bond yields, excessive valuations of Indian stocks and weak earnings.

With the Trump administration launching new initiatives for 'America First', Kotak Mutual Fund's Nilesh Shah says there's a ""quit emerging markets"" movement happening in the FII world.
""We saw one of a large private equity funds going and meeting President Trump and saying that you had asked me to bring $100 billion, here I am bringing $500 billion. Clearly, America First policy and higher interest rates, as well as high bond yields is pushing capital back to America,"" Shah said, adding that markets are likely to remain volatile over the near to medium term, based on the geopolitical risks and FII outflows.
With Trump Tantrum in full swing, FIIs aren’t paying attention to any positive domestic cues — at least for now. They have largely ignored Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Rs 1 lakh crore consumption boost through income tax cuts in the Budget, the rate cut by the RBI first time in five years, and the Delhi election results.
The FIIs have sold Indian equities worth $9.94 billion so far this year, according to NSDL data. ""Outflows are part of a broader EM (emerging markets) sell-off, but at 0.2% of market cap over the past month, India is the worst affected. Over the coming months though, further outflows can be expected: they are 0.1% of market cap over 12 months in India, vs 0.5-1.3% in other EMs. Further, uncertainty and UST yields remain high,""
Axis Capital
's Neelkanth Mishra said.
In the first 30 trading sessions of 2025, the FII 'ghar wapsi' campaign, or the flight of global capital back to their hometown US, has already led to $10 billion outflow from Dalal Street this year.
India's strategy for Trump Tantrum
A possible trade deal or some sort of mutual understanding on tariffs between India and the US during PM Modi's two-day visit to the US from February 12 during which he will meet Trump can keep India out of Trump's line of fire.
India is considering tariff reductions in at least a dozen sectors, including electronic, medical and surgical equipment, along with some chemicals, to raise US exports. These reductions align with New Delhi's domestic production plans, government officials have told Reuters. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that concessions are being considered for items that India primarily sources from the US or has potential to buy more of, such as dish antennas and wood pulp. Modi is expected to discuss tariffs with Trump next week and India is open to discussing a possible mini trade deal. The early visit hopes to avoid a ""trade war-like situation that is happening between U.S. and China,"" a third official said
The discussions on tariff concessions follow a reduction in India's average import tariff rates to 11% from 13% on several items in the annual budget, and a cut in taxes on high-end bikes and luxury cars. India is also reviewing surcharges levied on more than 30 items, including luxury cars and solar cells.
An understanding on trade between the two countries can prevent damage due to US tariffs to India's economy but can't guarantee reversal of FII outflows since the 'quit India' movement of the FIIs is part of a larger 'quit emerging markets' theme playing out due to Trump's America First policy as well as other factors such as a strong dollar and high US bond yields. In such a scenario, market experts say one should follow the asset allocation dharma by diversifying with other assets like gold, silver and debt.
Gold ETFs, for example, have given a return of over 9% in the last one month. When it comes to buying stocks, bottom-up strategy is more likely to work rather than basket buying. With Nifty trading at 20x one-year forward PE at 7% discount to its past five-year average, the valuation isn't too expensive to stay away from largecap stocks. ""Given the fact that a significant amount of correction has happened in the indexes as well as the broader markets, this is the time to initiate fresh investments with a medium to longer term perspective,"" said Joseph Thomas, Head of Research, Emkay Wealth Management.

Centre releases Rs 1.11 lakh crore interest-free loan to states in April-January,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-releases-rs-1-11-lakh-crore-interest-free-loan-to-states-in-april-january/articleshow/118121402.cms,10-02-2025,"The Centre has released about Rs 1.11 lakh crore loan to states during April-January under the scheme for special assistance to states for capital expenditure, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said on Monday. In the 2024-25 Budget,
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
hiked the allocations for interest-free loans to states for capital expenditure, enabling states to spend more on infrastructure and specified reforms. The allocation was hiked to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, up from disbursal of Rs 1.10 lakh crore made in 2023-24.
In a written reply in the Lok Sabha, Chaudhary said under the scheme for special assistance to states for capital expenditure, the Centre has approved loans worth Rs 1.22 lakh crore till January 31. Of this, about Rs 1.11 lakh crore has been released
Chaudhary said out of the total allocation of Rs 1.50 lakh crore, an amount of Rs 55,000 crore under Part-I of the scheme is untied. This amount has been allocated to the states in proportion to their share of central taxes and duties as per the award of the 15th Finance Commission.
The remaining amount of Rs 95,000 crore is inter-alia earmarked for reforms in certain citizen centric areas and taking up sector specific projects like development of iconic tourist centres on global scale; incentive for scrapping of old vehicles; stimulating industrial growth.
According to the data, the top beneficiary states so far in FY24 are Bihar (Rs 11,522 crore), followed by Uttar Pradesh (Rs 10,795 crore), Madhya Pradesh (Rs 10,166 crore), and West Bengal (Rs 9,729 crore).

Why is the Reserve Bank piling up tonnes of gold?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/why-is-the-reserve-bank-piling-up-tonnes-of-gold/articleshow/118120460.cms,10-02-2025,"Gold has lately been on a red-hot streak, with the price rising more than 10% so far in 2025.
Gold prices
jumped more than 1.5% on Monday to hit a record high. The gold is high on safe-haven demand due to fears of a global trade war after US President Donald Trump announced new tariff plans. Trump announced on Sunday plans to impose an additional 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports. He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs this week, matching rates imposed by other countries and applying them immediately. Gold is considered a safe investment during economic and geopolitical turmoil.
The
Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) too has been buying gold in large quantities. In the Lok Sabha today, Congress MP Manish Tiwari asked about whether the shift towards gold signalled a move away from the US dollar as a dominant settlement mechanism, ANI reported. However, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified that India's rising gold reserves, including those held by the
RBI
, are not intended to replace any international currency.
Regarding the RBI's gold purchases, Sitharaman confirmed that the central bank is accumulating gold to maintain a balanced reserve portfolio, ANI reported. While the US dollar has been a dominant component of India's foreign exchange reserves, the RBI also holds reserves in other currencies and gold. She stressed that the move is part of a strategy to diversify reserves rather than an indication of India shifting away from the dollar or pushing for an alternative international settlement mechanism. The statement comes at a time when global discussions around de-dollarization have gained momentum, with some countries exploring alternatives for trade and reserves. However, Sitharaman made it clear that India's increased gold accumulation does not signal any such shift.
The RBI on a gold-buying spree
India's foreign exchange reserves as of January 31 stood at $630.6 billion, up $1.05 billion from week ending January 24. This was the second straight increase in forex reserves after they had gone up by $5.5 billion previous week. The primary driver of this growth were gold reserves, which rose by $1.2 billion to settle at 70.89 billion.
The RBI added 72.6 tonnes to its stock of gold in 2024, quadrupling the incremental additions from a year ago, as it ranked just behind the Polish and Turkish central banks in net buying bullion through the year that witnessed massive currency volatility after Trump’s election in November.
Live Events
The RBI’s latest stock of gold amounted to 876.18 tonnes as of end December 2024 valued at $66.2 billion, up from 803.58 tonnes valued at $48.3 billion in the same period a year ago, implying a purchase of 72.6 tonnes in the calendar year. Incremental additions totaled 18 tonnes in 2023. The 2024 gold purchase is the highest since 2021 and the second highest in any calendar year since it started buying gold in 2017.
Significantly, the RBI, unlike many other global central banks like its Turkish, Swiss or even Chinese counterparts, seldom sells gold as it is a politically difficult decision. The Reserve Bank of India figures among the top ten holders of gold in its foreign exchange reserves.
Globally, central banks continued to buy gold at pace in 2024, with purchases exceeding 1,000 tonnes for the third year in a row. Buying ramped up significantly in Q4, reaching 333 tonne bringing the annual total for central banks to 1,045 tonne.
Why is the RBI piling up gold reserves?
The central bank has been aggressively buying gold because gold purchases help the central bank protect itself against currency volatility and the consequent revaluation of reserves. For example, during April-September 2024. $56 billion was added to the forex reserves on account of valuation gains, but a loss of $17.7 billion in the same period a year ago. Gold prices on the other hand rose over 25 percent during the year, helping in an equivalent amount of valuation gain on the central bank’s outstanding stock of gold even if the central bank does not book any trading profits on gold.
The RBI has accelerated gold purchases since October to mitigate revaluation risks to its foreign exchange stockpile and minimise currency volatility, with a part of the reserves that have come off record highs since late September likely also being used to cushion the rupee's fall against the US dollar.
""The buying of gold by central banks is driven by the need to diversify assets in which forex reserves are held,"" Gaura Sengupta, chief economist at IDFC Bank, had told ET last month. ""The high concentration of foreign currency assets in securities such as short-tenor US treasuries opens up risks of revaluation loss when US Treasury yields rise.""
""Another risk of revaluation loss rises during periods of dollar strength. Currently, central banks are facing both rising US Treasury yields and dollar strength, resulting in substantial revaluation loss,"" Sengupta said. ""The diversification of forex reserves into gold is aimed at reducing the risk of revaluation loss.""
The RBI has been actively accumulating gold as part of its reserves management strategy since December 2017. But it has become more aggressive post COVID and is one of the major buyers of gold among global central banks. The central bank’s stated objective of holding gold in reserves is mainly to diversify its foreign currency assets base, as a hedge against inflation and foreign currency risks. Central banks globally have actively started accumulating gold more aggressively after the Russia- Ukraine war started in February of 2022. The RBI too has followed the trend of central banks globally. As per various market analysts, active gold purchases by central banks are expected to continue. ""In 2025, we expect central banks to remain in the driving seat,"" Louise Street, Senior Markets Analyst at the World Gold Council, said.

‘Indirect’ hurdle is posing problems to overseas fund managers’ India plans,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/a-single-word-in-finance-bill-poses-hurdle-for-offshore-fund-managers-eyeing-india/articleshow/118093543.cms,10-02-2025,"A single word in the law, buttressed by the Finance Bill, has turned up as a showstopper for many
offshore fund managers
contemplating moving to India.
While the Budget has proposed scrapping most of the restrictions to encourage them to relocate, the stipulation that resident Indians cannot invest --- “directly or indirectly” --- more than 5% of the fund corpus is a hurdle that no fund manager is ready to navigate.
The sticking point here is the word “indirectly” in the particular section of the Income Tax Act : it is virtually impossible for any fund manager or administrator to figure out whether, and how much, resident Indians have contributed ‘indirectly’ (and probably unknowingly) in the money pooled by an overseas fund.
After the Budget was tabled, officials in the GIFT City International Financial Services Centre --- a location that New Delhi is selling as a destination for global fund managers --- drew the attention of the finance ministry, pointing out that most such fund managers would be reluctant to shift to India as long as the stipulation relating to ‘indirect investment by residents’ remains.
Under the law, an overseas fund’s asset management entity in India would not be considered as ‘permanent establishment’ or ‘place of effective management’ --- and therefore its global income would not be taxed by the Indian government --- if it fulfils a string of conditions. Most of these conditions have been relaxed in the recent Budget for global funds setting up its AMC in IFSC GIFT City, except for the 5% cap on direct and indirect contribution in the fund by resident Indians. (A global fund setting up office anywhere else other than GIFT City would, however, must meet all the conditions, including the one on investment by resident Indians, to avoid income tax on global income.)
Live Events
TRACKING INVESTMENTS TOUGH
“The Budget has relaxed the periodicity of tracking the 5% limit to only twice a year. But this has not helped. Tracking of resident Indian investment itself is challenging in the first place, especially in the case of master feeder and fund of fund structures. Ideally, there should have been a complete waiver of the 5% limit, particularly in the case of Category 1 FPIs, and also considering that SEBI
FPI regulations
provide for sufficient safeguards around resident Indian investments where different limits are allowed. To begin with, the 5% restriction should be relaxed for the Gift City as a test case. This would boost
global fund management
activity in Gift City,” said Rajesh Gandhi, partner,
Deloitte
.
While the condition in question is aimed at preventing investment round-tripping, most believe that SEBI and anti-money laundering rules are adequate to address the concern. The criteria on investment by residents is laid down in clause (c) of Section 9A of the Income Tax Act dealing with “activities not to constitute as business connection in India”, with the remaining conditions (such as minimum number of investors, maximum investment by the fund in an entity etc) stated in other clauses.
Given the amendments proposed in the Finance Bill, one may be led to believe that retaining clause (c) was not an oversight, but a conscious decision by the ministry officials. Why? The Act today empowers the government to modify any of the clauses under 9A through an Official Gazette notification. But the Bill proposes that the power to modify would extend to all the clauses except clause (c) dealing with direct and indirect investment by residents in a global fund (having no business connection in India).
According to Tejas Desai, partner and leader, asset management tax, EY India, “The proposed amendment of section 9A(3) falls short of industry's expectations. The requirement to assess indirect participation of resident Indians on specific dates (April 1 and October 1) does not address the real challenge, which is that funds lack the ability to obtain such declarations from global institutional investors. FPIs already adhere to SEBI’s stringent ownership tracking framework. Imposing additional reporting solely due to the fund manager’s location in India appears counterproductive. The industry seeks a more enabling regulatory environment that fosters growth, rather than restrictive criteria that deter fund managers from operating in India.”
More than large and marque international players, removing the restriction (clause c) would initially attract Indian fund houses (having offshore funds) to relocate to GIFT. An offshore global fund is one that deploys less than 50% of its corpus in securities in India. When the asset manager of such a fund is based abroad, resident Indians and NRIs can chip in up to 49% in the corpus of such a fund. (The investment limit by resident Indians comes down to 5% when the manager is based in India). Such a global fund, investing in markets other than India but having its manager based in India, need not be registered with SEBI. Resident Indians (though not NRIs) are barred from investing in India focused FPIs which invest 50% or more of the corpus in India.

"Focus on fiscal consolidation, growth supports India's credit profile: CareEdge Global",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/focus-on-fiscal-consolidation-growth-supports-indias-credit-profile-careedge-global/articleshow/118081674.cms,09-02-2025,"New Delhi: The
Union Budget
for 2025-26, presented on February 1, reinforces credibility in India's fiscal consolidation roadmap while emphasizing boosting the economy's overall growth potential,
CareEdge Global Ratings
said in a report.
Both these aspects -- commitment towards fiscal consolidation and emphasis on boosting the economy -- support CareEdge Global's of India at 'CareEdge\BBB+/Stable'.
At the same time, CareEdge Global believes that more needs to be done to address other
credit
weaknesses, such as high interest-to-revenue metrics and low-income levels over the coming decade.
The central government has stayed on the path of fiscal consolidation with fiscal deficit-to-GDP budgeted at 4.4 per cent in the
fiscal year
ending March 31, 2026, in line with the glide path envisioned in the previous budget announcements.
The other noteworthy aspect of the Budget was the continuation of the capex focus. Revenue expenditure-to-GDP is budgeted to moderate to 11 per cent in 2025-26 from 11.4 per cent in 2024-25, while the capex-to-GDP is budgeted to remain steady at 3.1 per cent.
Live Events
The Budget provided the future roadmap for the central government's debt-to-GDP, which remains on a downward trajectory to reach 50+-1 per cent by end-2030-31, from the estimated 57.1 per cent in 2024-25.
CareEdge projects India's General Government Gross (GGG) debt, which includes state government debt to remain on a downward trajectory in the medium term.
""Globally, the GG debt-to-GDP levels of most other major economies are projected to show a rising trend going forward. However, India is among a few major economies where the GGG debt-to-GDP is projected to fall,"" CareEdge Global Ratings said.
India continues to remain the world's fastest-growing major economy. The government's focus on capex-led growth has supported economic growth post-pandemic.
However, the economic momentum witnessed some deceleration, with real GDP growth estimated at a four-year low of 6.4 per cent in 2024-25, as per the First Advance Estimate released recently.
The Budget addressed some key economic concerns on the growth front.
CareEdge Global believes the reduction in
income tax
announced in the Budget will likely provide the much-needed impetus to domestic consumption.
In the Budget for 2025-26 tabled on February 1, the finance minister had announced that no income tax will be payable on income up to Rs 12 lakh, providing significant relief to taxpayers, especially the middle class. Earlier, this limit was Rs 7 lakh.

The RBI Friday cut the key interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%. Malhotra said most of the depreciation in the Indian currency has been driven by uncertainties that have arisen because of global factors, especially the tariff-related announcements by US President Donald Trump.

UK asks govt to recover tax from Indian bizman,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/uk-asks-govt-to-recover-tax-from-indian-bizman/articleshow/117992660.cms,07-02-2025,"In a seldom-used provision of the law, the British tax office has asked the Indian government and the Income tax (I-T) department to recover tax of an Indian who had left the UK years ago and is now settled in India.
The treaty between the two countries allows revenue authorities in the UK to approach the taxman here to claim unpaid tax. Typically, this is done once the dispute has reached a closure and the taxpayer in question is left with no legal option.
While other central agencies enforcing anti money-laundering regulations and criminal code often reach out to their foreign peers in locating and even attaching overseas assets of fugitives, employing treaty convention in seeking assistance for tax collection is uncommon.
In this instance, involving an outstanding tax claim of over 200,000 on an Indian businessman, the HM Revenue and Customs (UK) has written to Indian authorities to recover the amount. The claims pertain to the period between 2015 and 2017.
""The tax department is enforcing the tax demand of another country under the rule published in its manual. If the assessee is of the position that the same is not payable, he would have no choice but to pursue legal recourse in order to stop the tax recovery officer (TRO) from enforcing such a demand in another country. It's crucial to verify whether such a demand has reached a finality in the other country,"" said Rajesh P. Shah, partner at the CA firm Jayantilal Thakkar & Company.
Live Events
According to the I-T manual, Section 228A (1) of the Income-tax Act empowers the TRO to recover the amount and remit the recovered amount after deducting expenses in connection with recovery proceedings. In cases, where a view has been taken that such taxes are indeed due in the requesting country, steps for attaching the assets of the taxpayer, for example, a bank account may be taken.
However, under the procedure that must precede any such action -- and which the tax officials have to follow in the present case -- the TRO would contact the person with the request to clear the unpaid tax and obtain evidence of the payment. If the taxpayer insists that no amount is outstanding (or a lesser amount is due), the I-T official will examine such a declaration (by the assessee) and ask the UK tax office to provide further information in substantiating its claim.
According to Ashish Mehta, partner at the law firm Khaitan & Co, ""India has
tax treaties
with countries like the UK and Belgium that enable mutual assistance in collection of taxes. While these mechanisms have been in place for some time and were rarely invoked, there is increased administrative focus recently, on account of movement of taxpayers across borders.""
""There are safeguards prescribed in the tax treaties and arguments available to the taxpayers against granting of assistance (like public policy, whether tax collection rights of the requesting nation are final, etc), the general bend of the nations is to co-operate with each other in such proceedings,” said Mehta.
The TRO would have to obtain a statement on foreign tax offered to tax (in the UK) and amount of credit claimed while filing I-T returns in India. “Under the circumstances, the tax authority has to check whether the taxpayer has correctly claimed foreign tax credits or has correctly offered the foreign income to tax, in India, and ensure that appropriate action, if necessary, is taken within the statutory time limits. However, this approach of recovering revenue claims is infrequently used by countries. In a recent decision by the US Tax Court concerning the Canada-USA DTAA, the US Tax Court held that any challenge to the validity of the revenue claim should only be made in the country where the revenue claim has originated and not in the country which lends assistance in tax collection,” said Ashish Karundia, founder of the CA firm Ashish Karundia & Co.

Japan finds new bright spots for investment in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/japan-finds-new-bright-spots-for-investment-in-india/articleshow/117992540.cms,07-02-2025,"New Delhi: Japanese investments in
India
are moving beyond the well-established patterns and are now exploring new avenues in financial services, electronics and telecommunications.
According to
Seiji Ota
, partner at
Deloitte India
, Japanese investment patterns in India have evolved significantly over time.
""While the automotive and diversified industrial sectors have historically dominated Japanese capital allocation, recent years have witnessed a notable transformation in investment preferences. Financial services, electronics, telecommunications and media sectors have emerged as compelling destinations for Japanese investments,"" Ota told ET. Cutting-edge domains such as semiconductor manufacturing, sustainable technologies, infrastructure development and defence capabilities are among the new spheres being explored by Japanese investors.
""This diversification reflects a broader strategic shift in Japanese investment philosophy in India, moving beyond traditional manufacturing strongholds to embrace emerging technological and strategic sectors,"" Ota added. As per official data, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from
Japan
into India were $43.11 billion between April 2000 and September 2024. Japan is India's fifth largest source of FDI, with a 6.08% share in total equity inflows.
According to a Deloitte report, India came in first and Vietnam second in a fiscal 2023 ranking of promising countries and regions for investment for Japanese firms. While there has been a recent decrease in mergers and acquisition activities between India and Japan, this was due to the Covid pandemic.

""The market has been seeing a revival of those activities. We already see a roughly 30% increase from 2023 to 2024 (as of December 2024), which implies the investment momentum is robust from Japan to India,"" the report said, while adding that artificial intelligence, healthcare and renewables were key areas for dealmaking. Outbound deals from Japan to India stood at $1.22 billion (roughly 4.26% of total outbound deals $28.68 billion) during the first and second quarters of calendar year 2024. There were 343 inbound deals from Japan to India, resulting in investments of $62.35 billion during the past decade. Investments from India to Japan during this period totalled $4.85 billion. FDI flows to China have declined sharply, from a peak of $13.4 billion in 2012 to $3.4 billion in 2024. Conversely, FDI to India - $6 billion in 2024 - has been steadily increasing. The deal value peaked in 2021 with significant transactions such as Flipkart and Fullerton, suggesting tendencies to go for large deals, Deloitte said.
Supporting factors
A national policy of fostering STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) talent and escalating US-China tensions will further intensify the investments. ""India and Japan have been benefiting from the 'China Plus One' strategy, as investors look for alternatives in the region to park their money,"" the global consultancy major said in the report. Besides, there is also a huge potential for domestic demand to expand. India has a young population with an average age of 28 years and the largest working age population at 995 million in 2025. According to Deloitte, India is projected to post gross domestic product growth of 7.2% in 2024, followed by 6.6% in 2025 and 6.5% in 2026.
This means inflation growth will remain within the range of economic growth despite inflation spikes due to food prices. The stable growth outlook for the Indian economy contrasts starkly from a negative outlook on the Chinese and Japanese economies.
This is supplemented by a robust monetary policy and hefty foreign exchange reserves for India. In addition, India has a strong public investment climate with the rupee's fluctuation against the dollar, yen and other key currencies remaining comparatively lower. Rohit Berry, president-strategy, risk and transactions at Deloitte South Asia, says India is taking bold steps to bolster its role in the global supply chain. ""Successful partnerships between Indian and Japanese companies, coupled with sustained government support, will be pivotal in achieving this goal and enhancing the sector's resilience,"" he said. He highlighted India's recent economic reforms, including reduced compliances, decriminalised provisions and structural changes like liberalised foreign investment, modernised bankruptcy and labour laws, and a unified GST, to have greatly enhanced its business environment.
""Ongoing efforts to simplify regulations, dematerialise shares, streamline KYC processes, and rationalise GST slabs will further boost its appeal to foreign investors,"" Berry said.
Further, the Indian government's support for manufacturing through production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for 14 sectors, extending an incentive of 4-6% on incremental sales, greatly improves prospects. Japanese companies such as
Panasonic
, TDK, Daikin, Toshiba, NEC and Fujitsu have benefited from the PLI schemes. There are around 755 beneficiaries of the PLI schemes and around ₹1.5 lakh crore incremental investments of the targeted ₹3 lakh crore have already come in. There is a production increase in terms of sales of ₹12.5 lakh crore and employment generation for about 1.05 million people, both of which are a third of the original target.
PLI challenges
However, Deloitte said delays in incentive disbursement and approval processes, difficulties in meeting domestic value addition requirements within stipulated timeframes and steep year-on-year growth targets for revenue and production are some of the challenges with respect to the PLI schemes. Investors have also raised concerns on supply chain challenges such as an underdeveloped component ecosystem - particularly in electronics - and high dependency on imports for critical components and policy-related issues, including frequent changes in implementation guidelines.

again outpaced
deposit growth
in the beginning of the fourth quarter putting pressure on resources forcing many banks to raise
deposit
rates.
Lending increased 11.4 percent year-on-year as of January 24, 2025 compared to over 15 percent in the same period a year ago, while deposits rose 10.3 percent compared to 13.2 percent in the same in the same period a year ago, the latest
Reserve Bank of India
data released on Thursday shows
This slowdown is attributed to a higher base effect, RBI measures such as higher risk weights and the proposed liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) norms, and a focus on managing the
Credit-to-Deposit ratio
which continues to hover around 80%, according to Caredge Ratings.
After reporting strong growth in FY’24,
credit
offtake is expected to moderate in FY25. This slowdown is largely driven by decreased unsecured retail lending and slower advances to NBFCs.
Higher risk weights and asset quality issues in specific segments are anticipated to keep growth subdued in the near term, Caredge said in a report. Additional challenges include an increased emphasis on strengthening the deposit base and managing the Credit-to-Deposit ratio, which is currently around 80%. Other factors are tight liquidity conditions, expected higher provisioning for the infrastructure sector, and the proposed liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) regulations.
Live Events
The Reserve Bank has raised concerns over slowdown in bank deposits and that resorting to non deposit sources to fund growth would have implications of cost of funds and profit margins of banks.
“Recent trends indicate a shift in household preference to financial assets for saving purposes leading to movement of these savings beyond traditional bank deposits towards capital market assets” said deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao in a recent speech.

India’s cash deficit eases after RBI opens fund tap,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-cash-deficit-eases-after-central-bank-opens-fund-tap/articleshow/117940145.cms,05-02-2025,"The
cash crunch
plaguing India’s banking system has more than halved after the central bank took aggressive liquidity injection measures amid faltering economic growth.
Deficit liquidity, or the amount that lenders borrow from the
Reserve Bank of India
, stood at 660.4 billion rupees ($7.6 billion) as on Feb. 4, down from 2.2 trillion rupees on Jan. 30, according to a Bloomberg Economics index.
The cash injection has also led to a decline in the weighted average call rate, which represents banks’ overnight borrowing costs. The rate has dropped from a high of 6.88% last month to align with the benchmark policy repurchase rate of 6.50%. Local swaps have also eased, with the one-year rate falling by as much as 26bps below the
RBI
’s key rate.
Bloomberg
Factors including a pick-up in government spending at the start of the month have also helped shrink the cash shortage, which had risen to 3 trillion rupees late last month, the highest in at least 14 years. The central bank’s dollar sales to protect the rupee from volatility, tax outflows and larger cash withdrawals from banks had added to the tight liquidity.
“There is a need for further liquidity infusion because the pressure on the rupee continues, which necessitates some amount of RBI intervention and that is a drag on liquidity,” said Sakshi Gupta, an economist at
HDFC Bank
. “As we move into March, there will be tax outflows again.”

"Bid to attract foreign investors: FEMA rules to be eased further, says DEA Secretary",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/bid-to-attract-foreign-investors-fema-rules-to-be-eased-further-says-dea-secretary/articleshow/117894132.cms,04-02-2025,"New Delhi: The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are in talks to further ease foreign exchange rules, especially with regard to non-debt instruments, economic affairs secretary
Ajay Seth
told ET. He said the exercise focused on simplifying Foreign Exchange Management Act (
FEMA
) regulations and updating them to modern standards will be completed in three-four months.
Given that sector-specific limits for foreign direct investment (FDI) have already been substantially relaxed, the government is turning its attention to easing restrictive rules to woo
foreign investors
.
These changes will further liberalise the rules on equity investments, helping India attract more risk capital.
Secretary, Economic Affairs, Ajay Seth
“The (legislation) was designed with assumptions and economic situations 25 years ago and certainly requires a closer look,” Seth said. Some measures had been initiated after the July 2024 budget and more will follow once the review process is over, he said.
Having scaled a peak of almost $85 billion in FY22, total FDI fell over two years to $71 billion in FY24. To be sure, equity FDI has surged 45% on year in the first half of FY25 to $29.8 billion from $20.5 billion.
Live Events
Regulations for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were relaxed in November. Their investments would be categorised as FDI once they exceeded the 10% FPI ownership limit in an Indian company. This was done after the July 2024 budget said a simpler foreign investment regime would be put in place.
The government had in August 2024 eased crossborder share swaps, allowing the issue or transfer of equity instruments of a local company in exchange for those of a foreign firm. Also, investments by an overseas citizen of India on a non-repatriation basis would not be counted as indirect foreign investment.
FACTOR MARKET REFORM
Seth said the government will prepare medium-tolong-term plans for land reforms in urban areas, building on the July 2024 budget announcements. Financial sector reforms are also being discussed.
“The Financial Stability Development Council (FSDC), which is looking at financial sector reforms, will also look at the capital-side reforms,” Seth said. “These are all work in progress and we have some distance to go.”
The FSDC, a platform on which all the financial sector regulators are represented, is headed by the finance minister.
BROADER REGULATORY EASING
Seth said the expert committee proposed in the February 1 budget to review non-financial sector regulations will examine licences, compliance and inspections among other matters with the broad principle of “trust first and scrutinise later,” as FM Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her speech.
He said states are being encouraged to participate in this exercise. Rules in the financial sector are largely driven by the Union government and the relevant watchdogs. However, several non-financial sector regulations are primarily handled by the states, he said.

She had announced setting up of a Rs 1 lakh crore R&D fund in the Budget last July.
""To implement the private sector-driven Research, Development and Innovation initiative announced in the July budget, I am now allocating Rs 20,000 crore,"" she had said.
Meanwhile, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said various measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Budget 2025-26 targetted to support the economic growth by encouraging domestic manufacturing and demand amidst geopolitical uncertainties.
""It is quite clear that the current state of the world, in terms of geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainties, is very much the guiding tool behind many of the proposals you see in the Budget, including the widely discussed tax cut,"" he said.
The income tax cut, which is likely to boost consumer demand in the economy, can nudge the private sector to expand capacity, he said.
Thus, the private capital expenditure, which has been happening at a slower than expected pace so far, will pick up going ahead, he added.
As part of fiscal measures to boost growth, the Budget proposed significant income tax cuts for the middle class. Individuals earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh a year will not have to pay any taxes, benefitting 1 crore taxpayers.
The Union Budget 2025-26 proposes new direct tax slabs and rates under the new income tax regime so that no tax is needed to be paid for total income up to Rs 12 lakh per annum. Salaried individuals earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh per annum will pay nil tax, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.

"Union Budget 2025: Powering 360-degree growth via investments, tax reforms",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/union-budget-2025-powering-3600-growth-via-investments-tax-reforms/articleshow/117867145.cms,03-02-2025,"In response to the nation's growing economic expectations, the budget provides a 360-degree retort for all sects of society. Recent adjustments in growth projections by the RBI, frenzy of
foreign institutional investors
(FIIs) exiting from capital markets, alongside signs of economic strain in recent corporate results, have prompted a focus on growth and sustenance of the economy. Even with geopolitical uncertainty, the new US administration and growing geo-political tensions, the budget has created an environment of inclusiveness and long-term opportunity for India to establish itself as a credible and lucrative geography with a clear glide-path to fiscal deficit of 4.4% while ensuring continued capital expenditure to boost physical and
digital infrastructure
.
The budget prioritises agriculture, MSMEs, investment and exports as key growth engines, centered on three strategic pillars -people, economy, and innovation. Emphasis on increasing disposable income aiming to impact growth, consumption, savings, and investments and focus on Garib, Yuva, Annadata, and Nari (Poor, Youth, Farmer, and Women),
tax reforms
, innovation, infrastructure and skill development are steps in the right direction.
There are clear efforts to streamline regulatory framework, rationalise tariff structures and tax benefits for the healthcare sector. Raising FDI limit for the insurance sector and IFSC liberalisation are strategic moves to enhance economic stability and attract investments.
The focus on providing relief for the middle class through rationalisation of tax slabs and enhancement in tax rebate, as well as changes in TDS/TCS provisions will enhance taxpayer confidence. Moreover, long-term economic resilience as reflected in initiatives such as credit schemes for MSMEs, Export Promotion Mission, Bharat Trade Net, and the development of Global Capability Centres (GCCs) will boost productivity. The effort required towards
infrastructure development
is slightly muted, however, 50-year interest free loans to state governments are expected to provide a significant boost. The budget reaffirms the government's commitment to fostering an innovation-driven, inclusive, and sustainable economy. There will be expectations from the private sector to deeply wedge into India's growth story, more so, with a motivated workforce resultant from tax reforms. It's important to watch out for the new tax code in the coming week.
If promise in this budget crystalises, India is poised to have its desired and inclusive growth coupled with increased investments from domestic and foreign investors in achieving its rightful standing in the global arena.

Funds in a fix over new rules on treatment of big investors,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/funds-in-a-fix-over-new-rules-on-treatment-of-big-investors/articleshow/117865637.cms,03-02-2025,"Mumbai: Several private
equity
(PE) and
venture capital
(VC) funds are in a quandary over the new rules that forbid them from offering lower fees and extra rights to large investors.
While giving preferential treatments to attract big money is common among funds in the international markets, the practice runs counter to the recent regulations that have not only questioned the way fund managers run their business function but have also raised practical challenges.
Last week, a committee constituted by the
Securities and Exchange Board of India
(Sebi) to improve the
ease of doing business
for
alternative investment funds
(AIFs), urged the regulator to resolve the issues faced by the funds.
The new regulations, which came into force towards end-2024, require AIFs (the regulatory parlance for pooled vehicles like PE and VC funds) to maintain 'pro-rata' and 'pari-passu rights' for investors. In other words, not only should investors be on an equal footing-where all have the same rights-their shares of the whole investment should be equal to their respective contributions.
However, fund managers say that following the Sebi rules to the letter may not be possible under the present set-up. Against this backdrop, senior members of the AIF industry and domain experts believe that the regulations must be reviewed for various situations.
Live Events
First, a fund charging a lower management fee and expenses to an investor will end up investing a proportionately higher amount (from the investor's account) compared to the contribution of another investor who is charged a higher fee. Since the amount invested on account of each investor is net of the fees, a lower fee would mean more left for investment.
In such a situation, the distribution (of the gains and earnings of the AIF) would be higher to an investor who was charged a lower fee. Here, an AIF's drawdown on funds from various categories of investors and the subsequent distribution would clash with the Sebi rule of treating investors on a pro-rata basis.
Under the circumstances, regulations should factor in variations in investor-specific management fees, and examine whether the pro-rata rights could be confined to each class of investors.
Unlike mutual funds, AIFs have multiple classes of investors. Besides lowers fees, top investors are often shared more information and are offered co-investment rights (which allow such investors to invest directly alongside the funds). However, privileges like 'draw-stop rights' which allow large and institutional investors to halt further contributions under certain conditions, though common globally, may be against the pari-passu principle insisted by Sebi.
The pro-rata rights can also be undermined due to exchange-rate fluctuations with overseas investors in AIFs making capital commitments in different foreign currency denominations. AIFs, which are incorporated onshore, can freely accept funds from local as well overseas investors. If the local currency weakens when a manager draws down the money, the fund would end up investing more than the initial amount of equivalent rupees that was committed by an offshore investor.
While the specific recommendations of the committee are yet to be released, the industry in general is of the view that the regulations could be tweaked to consider a carve-out for
open-ended funds
(in which investors can enter or exit freely). ""This is because here the distributions to various investors are made on the basis of a fund's
net asset value
and not on the amount of capital committed,"" said an industry person. (Another panel, the 'standard setting committee' which recently shared its report to the AIF lobby, has not addressed these issues).
Sources said some AIFs were planning to postpone distributions to investors till the industry receives greater clarity on questions connected to the pro-rata rights.
On November 18, Sebi amended rules governing AIF to lay down the pro-rata and pari-passu rights for investors. In giving some flexibility, the regulator, in December, said that pro-rata rights would not apply to cases where investors are excused or excluded from specific investments, fail to meet their contribution obligations, or share profits with fund managers or sponsors. But these exemptions, though necessary, are not adequate in tackling the operational hurdles.

"India grows faster, yet has miles to go to beat China's trillions",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-grows-faster-yet-has-miles-to-go-to-beat-chinas-trillions/articleshow/117853729.cms,02-02-2025,"India is set to achieve its highest single-year GDP addition of $383 billion in 2025, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This figure will be a record for India, except for the post-Covid surge in 2021. Despite India's projected growth rate of 6.5% in 2025, surpassing China's 4.5%, China is expected to add $1.26 trillion to its economy during the same period.
The difference in economic expansion between the two nations is attributed to China's history of consistently achieving double-digit growth. Since 1980, China has registered growth rates above 10% on 15 occasions, including a remarkable stretch from 1983 to 1995 when it saw double-digit growth in 9 out of 13 years. On the other hand, India has yet to witness a single year of double-digit GDP growth, with the highest recorded being 9.6% in 1988.
TNN
In 2021, India recorded a 9.7% post-pandemic economic rebound. In 2022, India's economy grew by 7%, while China reported a lower growth rate of 3% but managed to avoid a Covid-induced economic collapse in 2020.
TNN
In 1980, India and China had economies of comparable sizes. However, by 2029, China's GDP is projected to be four times larger than India's. For India to match China's anticipated GDP addition of $1.26 trillion in 2025, its economy would need to grow by 32% in dollar terms over the previous year—a challenging target by any measure.
Live Events
TNN
The gap in prosperity between the two nations is also expected to widen as China benefits from a shrinking population. With China's population projected to be half its current size by the end of the century, its per capita income in dollar terms will likely see more significant gains, further accentuating the economic disparity with India.

The budget proposes zero levy for taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh, while raising the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh a year. In the new regime, those with a taxable salary of up to Rs 7 lakh a year do not pay any tax through the appropriate rebates. The government said about one million assessees, who earlier paid Rs 20,000-80,000 tax annually, will now pay nothing. A person earning Rs 12 lakh a year would save Rs 80,000 in taxes.
It's a Boon for High Income-Earners Too
This is a substantial relief that experts say will boost consumption and increase savings. The salaried earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh a year, inclusive of the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, will effectively not pay any tax from the next financial year.
High income earners will get bigger absolute savings, though in percentage terms, it will be lower. A person with taxable income of Rs 25-50 lakh will save Rs 1.1 lakh in tax a year.
Live Events
In all, 87.5 million filed income tax returns in the last assessment year, that is, 2024-25. An estimated 63 million availing of the new regime will benefit from the changes.
It is expected that more will opt for this regime from FY26.

"View: Budget 2025, a much-needed shot of growth hormones",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/view-budget-2025-a-much-needed-shot-of-growth-hormones/articleshow/117841376.cms,02-02-2025,"The budget is directionally positive as it addresses key sectors: healthcare, R&D, skilling and employment, MSMEs, startups, and exports. This can lay a strong foundation for sustained economic expansion and development.
Healthcare
The provisions to improve access to critical treatments by exempting over 35 life-saving drugs from basic customs duty, applying concessional duty on six more and expanding duty exemptions for patient assistance programmes are welcome. However, it is a bit disappointing that the exemption is restricted to imported drugs and innovator drugs. If GoI allows GST exemption on all drugs for cancer and chronic diseases, which are costly, it could make a huge impact. Unless GoI does that, it will not be serving maximum number of patients, which is the ultimate objective. We also need to examine the fine print to determine if GoI has made substantial allocations to raise healthcare spending to 2.5% of GDP, as targeted by the National Health Policy 2017 for 2025. The decline in healthcare’s share of the total budget from 2.3% in FY20 to 1.9% in FY25 raised concerns about critical gaps in healthcare accessibility, quality and affordability.
Other measures announced, such as setting up daycare cancer centres in all district hospitals and ensuring broadband connectivity in primary healthcare centres, are good. Raising the FDI limit in the insurance sector to 100% is positive for the industry, which relies on insurance linkages to improve accessibility and affordability of advanced treatments. For instance, therapies like cell and gene therapy are prohibitively expensive, but with robust insurance mechanisms in place, they could become accessible to more patients.
Research & innovation
The allocation of Rs 20,000 cr to implement private sector-driven research, development and innovation is a good step towards promoting value-based, IP-led growth in pharma. The introduction of 10,000 research fellowships at IITs and IISc and setting up of Atal Tinkering Labs in 50,000 state schools can accelerate India’s transition to a knowledge-driven economy.
Live Events
Ease of doing business
The decision to establish a regulatory reforms committee could lead to enhancing ease of doing business and attract investments. However, for these reforms to be truly effective, it is essential to include industry reps because they can provide valuable insights.
Startups
A new Fund of Funds with an expanded scope and an additional Rs 10,000 cr contribution will further bolster
startup funding
, building on the existing government contribution of Rs 10,000 cr. The doubling of the credit guarantee scheme for startups to Rs 20 cr will provide much-needed financial support to emerging ventures. Similarly, the enhancement of the credit guarantee cover for MSMEs to Rs 10 cr and the provision of short-term loans will ease liquidity constraints and facilitate the growth of MSMEs.
Spurring domestic consumption
The significant personal I-T relief is a welcome move. This is expected to provide a massive boost to domestic consumption. It’s a stable budget that addresses all the important growth drivers in terms of investment priorities. However, given the evolving geopolitical and geoeconomic landscape and the intensifying competition for investments, it remains to be seen whether the budget has done enough to strengthen our competitiveness, incentivise investments in hi-tech sectors, and align with global policies to position India as a preferred destination for capital and innovation.

India is still listed among the top four foreign exchange reserves holders in the world.
“India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at USD 640.3 billion as of the end of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90 per cent of the country’s external debt of $711.8 billion as of September 2024, reflecting a strong buffer against external vulnerabilities” the Economic Survey said.
After surpassing the $ 700 billion benchmark, India’s foreign exchange reserves moderated to $ 640.3 billion as of the end of December 2024.
Despite a nearly $ 60 billion dip in reserves from its peak, India is still among the world's largest foreign exchange reserve-holding countries in 2024. It is ranked fourth globally, following China, Japan, and Switzerland, the survey said.
Supported by net positive capital inflows, reserves increased by $ 27.1 billion in 2024. Foreign currency assets constituted the bulk of this increase, strengthening India’s overall reserve position, it said.

"No GST on penal charges levied by banks, NBFCs: CBIC",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/no-gst-on-penal-charges-levied-by-banks-nbfcs-cbic/articleshow/117647450.cms,28-01-2025,"Goods and Services Tax (GST) will not be applicable on penal charges levied by banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), the CBIC has said. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) through a circular has also clarified that GST will not be levied on transactions of up to Rs 2,000 facilitated by payment aggregators on online platforms.
Clarifying the issue of GST applicability on penal charges levied by banks and NBFCs, the CBIC said penal charges levied by Regulated Entities governed by the RBI are essentially in the nature of charges for breach of terms of contract and hence, do not attract GST.
""As recommended by the 55th GST Council, it is hereby clarified that no GST is payable on the penal charges levied by Regulated Entities... for non-compliance with material terms and conditions of loan contract by the borrower,"" the CBIC said.
AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said this clarification is significant as it settles interpretational disputes at the field level.
""By reiterating the essence of contractual obligations' that contracts are meant for performance and not breach' the GST Council has eliminated ambiguity regarding the taxability of such charges. The exclusion of penal charges from the GST ambit ensures compliance with RBI directives and prevents undue financial burdens on regulated entities and borrowers,"" Mohan added.

With regard to taxation on payment aggregators, the CBIC said it has received representations seeking clarity on the applicability of GST exemption to Payment Aggregators (PAs) in relation to settlement of up to Rs 2,000 in a single transaction, transacted through credit card, debit card, charge card or other payment card services.
Payment Aggregators (PAs) are entities that facilitate e-commerce sites and merchants to accept various payment instruments from their customers without the need for the e-commerce sites and merchants to create a separate payment integration system of their own. In the process, PAs receive payments from customers, pool and transfer them on to the merchants within a specified time period.
The CBIC also quoted RBI guidelines which distinguish PAs and Payment Gateways, which provide technology infrastructure to route and facilitate processing of an online payment transaction without any involvement in handling of funds.
""It is hereby clarified that GST exemption ... is available to RBI regulated Payment Aggregators (PAs) in relation to settlement of an amount, up to Rs 2,000 in a single transaction, transacted through credit card, debit card, charge card or other payment card services, as PAs fall within the definition of 'acquiring bank',"" the CBIC said.
The CBIC also clarified that this GST exemption is limited to payment settlement function only, which involves handling of money, and does not cover Payment Gateway services.
EY Tax Partner, Saurabh Agarwal said the clarifications issued by the CBIC on interpretative issues demonstrate the Government's commitment to foster a predictable tax environment for businesses. This approach is likely to lead to greater tax certainty and a more conducive business environment.

Lower budget borrowing may add to India cash boost cheer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/lower-budget-borrowing-may-add-to-india-cash-boost-cheer/articleshow/117622195.cms,28-01-2025,"India’s net borrowings will likely decline for a second straight year, possibly extending a rally in the nation’s bonds, as the government is expected to stick to its fiscal consolidation path.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration will borrow 11.4 trillion rupees ($132 billion) for the fiscal year that begins April 1, lower than the 11.6 trillion rupees for the current year, according to the median estimate of 20 economists polled by Bloomberg. Gross borrowing, which includes repayments, may rise slightly to 14.7 trillion rupees.
Bond yields slid to a fresh three-year low after the central bank unleashed a raft of steps late Monday to infuse nearly $18 billion of liquidity in the system. Yield on the 10-year bond dropped as much as six basis points to 6.63%.
The borrowing announcement will be made during the Feb. 1 federal budget, with the financial system facing a cash squeeze and foreign investors selling out of India’s markets. Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
is tasked with reviving growth, maintaining fiscal discipline, and win a sovereign ratings upgrade. Most economists predict she’ll stick to the roadmap of narrowing the
budget
deficit to 4.5% of the gross domestic product in the next fiscal year.
“The fiscal consolidation should continue to bring down the deficit to more sustainable levels and reduce the overall debt pile,” said Pankaj Pathak, fixed-income fund manager at Quantum Asset Management Co. “This is a favorable environment wherein the supply of bonds is not growing or growing at a tepid pace” while demand from long-term buyers is rising.

Bloomberg
While demand from insurance and pension funds will continue to support the market, the key change is a shift in incremental demand. The central bank is seen as a main buyer of sovereign debt amid waning demand from overseas funds. The secondary market purchases are aimed at easing a cash deficit, which widened to its most in a decade last week.
Nomura Holdings Inc. earlier estimated around 2 trillion rupees of purchases from the
RBI
, while Standard Chartered Plc’s forecast was for as much as 1.5 trillion rupees for the coming year. More liquidity infusion might still be needed before the fiscal year-end in March, analysts at Standard Chartered and Citigroup Inc. said after Monday’s announcement.
This comes as heightened global uncertainty clouds the outlook for foreign flows into India. The country will reach its full 10% weight in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s emerging market bond index by March, likely diminishing a key source of demand. Last year, bonds eligible for index inclusion drew $14.3 billion, pushing Indian yields down 41 basis points, even as US yields surged nearly 70 basis points.
The 10-year yield is expected to drop to 6.50% by the end of the year, as per the Bloomberg poll, suggesting about 15 basis points easing from the current levels.
“While gross Indian government bond issuance could increase modestly in FY26, the continued decline in net issuance is more important,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Upasana Chachra wrote in a note. “That should still allow government securities to rally over the medium term.”

Liquidity push: RBI readies ₹1.5 lakh crore injection,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/liquidity-push-rbi-readies-1-5-lakh-crore-injection/articleshow/117611950.cms,28-01-2025,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monday announced a host of measures to inject durable
liquidity
into the system, including a ₹60,000-crore bond purchase, a 56-day variable repo rate auction of ₹50,000 crore, and a $5-billion USD/rupee buy/sell swap auction for a six-month tenure.
Economists believe these steps increase the probability of a rate reduction in February.
These measures are estimated to collectively inject ₹1.5 lakh crore in a phased manner into the banking system, which witnessed a peak gap at ₹3.15 lakh crore on January 23, and has faced an average daily deficit of ₹1.96 lakh crore through this month.
""The RBI will continue to monitor evolving liquidity and market conditions and take measures as appropriate to ensure orderly liquidity conditions,"" said a central bank statement announcing the measures.
Yields on 10-year government bonds, which touched a three-year low on Monday at 6.64%, are expected to ease further to the 6.60% level in the next few days.

RBI Action Last Week
The RBI's concerted action follows the net purchase of Rs 10,175 crore of bonds in the
secondary market
in the week ended January 17, data published by the central bank last Friday showed. The market estimates the RBI likely purchased another Rs 10,000 crore of bonds in the week ending January 24.
Treasury heads and economists say the measures to ease liquidity in the system would pave the way for a repo rate cut. The RBI's rate-setting committee will meet between February 5 and 7.
""The RBI measure shows a preference for tools other than the
cash reserve ratio
(CRR) to inject durable liquidity, and so we no longer expect a CRR cut in the upcoming policy,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, head of India economic research, Standard Chartered Bank.
She expects the RBI to buy more bonds to inject durable liquidity, and has advanced the projection of two 25 basis point repo rate cuts to February and April, respectively, from April and June earlier.
One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Liquidity & Rates
At a recent meeting with the RBI, treasury heads suggested a policy rate cut without liquidity infusion would not be effective in transmitting rates.
Treasury heads and economists estimated the liquidity deficit to peak to Rs 4 lakh crore by the end of March, partly due to advance tax outflows, if the RBI did not act.
""We expect more easing will be needed given the continued pressure over the next few months,"" said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist,
Kotak Mahindra Bank
. ""The liquidity easing measures also increases the probability of a repo rate cut in the upcoming February policy.""
After the market closing hours, the RBI announced three bond purchases auctions under the open market operations (OMO) of Rs 20,000 crore each on January 30, February 13, and February 20. It will hold a 56-day VRR auction on February 7 for Rs 50000 crore, while the USD/Rupee buy/sell swap auction of USD 5 bn for the tenor of six months will be held on January 31.
""This is probably one of the ways the RBI could indirectly cut rates with easy liquidity, without actually cutting rates,"" Madhavi Arora, lead economist,
Emkay Global
, told ET. ""With these measures, I think positions will be comfortable for the next two months.""
Similarly, economists had made a case for the RBI to infuse liquidity and refrain from selling dollars to support the rupee.
""The core liquidity deficit stood around Rs 53,000 crore as on January 17 and could rise to Rs 1-1.5 lakh crore by the fiscal year-end only due to currency leakage. (There are) other factors also at play, such as foreign-exchange outflows, which totalled Rs 5 lakh crore since end-September,"" Kanika Pasrisha, chief economic advisor,
Union Bank of India
told ET.

NITI Aayog
.
The state secured the highest overall FHI score of 67.8, ranking No. 1 in the nation for the first time.
The FHI report, which evaluates the fiscal health of Indian states based on key parameters, highlights Odisha's strong performance in several areas, particularly in Debt Index and Debt Sustainability.
It said ""Odisha excels in fiscal health with the highest overall index score of 67.8. It tops the Debt Index (99.0) and Debt Sustainability (64.0) rankings with better than average scores under Quality of Expenditure and Revenue Mobilization"".
The state achieved an outstanding score of 99.0 in Debt Index, indicating its effective debt management, and 64.0 in Debt Sustainability, which reflects its ability to maintain manageable debt levels. Odisha's fiscal discipline has been key to maintaining low fiscal deficits, a good debt profile, and an above-average Capital Outlay/GSDP ratio.
Live Events
In addition to its strong debt management, Odisha has performed better than average in two other crucial sub-indices: Quality of Expenditure and Revenue Mobilization.
The state has shown significant progress in mobilizing non-tax revenue, especially through mining-linked premiums. On average, Odisha's own non-tax revenue accounted for 21 per cent of its total revenue, placing it alongside states like Jharkhand, Goa, and Chhattisgarh in effectively leveraging non-tax sources.
The state's ability to prioritize both social and economic services, especially in sectors like health and education, has been another factor contributing to its success.
Odisha's revenue expenditure on health and education grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.8 per cent during 2020-2022, outpacing the growth in these areas by major states, which stood at a CAGR of 22.6 per cent.
The NITI Aayog report highlights that Odisha is committed to prudent fiscal management, as it is among the few states in India that have adhered to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act's parameters since 2005.
The state has taken numerous measures to ensure its fiscal indicators remain healthy, with a focus on long-term sustainability.
Overall, Odisha's performance in the Fiscal Health Index highlights its robust economic management, making it a role model for other states in terms of fiscal prudence and development.

Donald Trump
to the White House raises hopes of friendly regulations and these assets attaining the status of reserves, said the participants in a panel discussion at the
World Economic Forum
.
The newly sworn-in U.S. administration, led by President Donald Trump, is expected to bring renewed hope for clear
cryptocurrency
regulations, which could drive increased investment and user adoption of blockchain technology globally, according to a panel of industry executives at the World Economic Forum.
“This is the dawn of the new day,’’ said Brian Armstrong, cofounder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. ""In the last four years in the US, there was a very hostile environment. The lack of clarity got weaponised and some people in the government tried to curtail or kill the industry unlawfully. Now, we have a path to get clear roles and hopefully have legislation passed through congress which will bring in a lot of new investments.”
Fortunes of crypto assets have been yo-yoing for years as regulators and governments have been averse to have a full-fledged currency status for the technology backed assets. While some accept cryptos such as Bitcoins, some emerging markets such as India are averse to even treating them as assets, leave alone currency.
Trump’s directive for every U.S. government agency to create rules supporting innovation in the sector is a remarkable step, and its contribution to the surge in the price of cryptocurrencies cannot be denied, said Armstrong.
Live Events
Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, said the regulatory clarity will emerge quickly as Trump has promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world.
Bitcoin Strategic Reserves
Trump had proposed the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve (SBR), which would involve the U.S. purchasing large amounts of the cryptocurrency over the coming years to back the fiat currency.
Armstrong said the volatility associated with Bitcoin would recede over a period of time and that it should be considered the new gold standard. If the US passed legislation it would gain currency and force others to follow suit, including the G20 nations, potentially driving up Bitcoin’s value significantly.
The panel discussed the path to mass crypto adoption, emphasising the integration of traditional financial services with blockchain. They cited the approval of ETFs, which became the fastest-growing ETFs of all time, as an important milestone.

Domestic investment announcements cross Rs 37 lakh crore in last two years: SBI Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/domestic-investment-announcements-cross-rs-37-lakh-crore-in-last-two-years-sbi-report/articleshow/117480684.cms,23-01-2025,"New Delhi:
Domestic investment announcements
in India have seen a remarkable surge, crossing Rs 37 lakh crore in the last two fiscal years (FY23 and FY24), according to a report by the State Bank of India (SBI).
This represents a significant jump from the Rs 10 lakh crore recorded in FY21, driven by robust contributions from both the government and private sectors.
It said ""Domestic Investment Announcements - Crossed Rs 37 lakh crore in last two years"".
The report highlighted that during the first nine months of FY25 (9MFY25), investments worth over Rs 32 lakh crore were announced, marking an increase from Rs 23 lakh crore during the same period in the previous year. This growth highlights the sustained momentum in investment activities across the country.
A notable trend observed in the report is the rising share of private sector participation in investment announcements. From around 50 per cent in FY21, the private sector's share climbed to approximately 68 per cent in FY22 and FY23.
Live Events
The report added that this upward trend continued in 9MFY25, with private players accounting for over 70 per cent of the total announced investments.
It said ""In 9MFY25, investment of more than Rs 32 lakh crore announced as compared to Rs 23 lakh crore previous year"".
Sector-wise, the report revealed that the manufacturing sector saw the highest number of projects, with 1,493 announcements amounting to Rs 5,97,921 crore in investments during 9MFY25. The power sector attracted the largest investment value, with 1,172 projects worth Rs 13,58,783 crore.
The mining sector recorded 72 projects with a total investment of Rs 56,628 crore, while the oil and gas sector saw 62 projects worth Rs 35,623 crore.
These figures reflect the ongoing efforts to boost economic activity and create a favorable environment for investment in critical sectors, paving the way for sustained growth in the coming years.

"RBI expected to transfer another bumper payout to govt, analysts say",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-expected-to-transfer-another-bumper-payout-to-govt-analysts-say/articleshow/117478141.cms,23-01-2025,"India’s central bank will likely make another windfall payout to the government on account of its intervention in currency markets to stem the decline in the rupee, according to economists.
IDFC First Bank
Ltd. estimates 2 trillion rupees ($23.1 billion) of transfer by the
Reserve Bank of India
while QuantEco Research pegs the dividend around 1.5 trillion rupees for the fiscal year that ends in March. The payout stood at 2.1 trillion rupees in the earlier year.
The RBI makes an annual payout to the government from the surplus income it earns on investments and valuation changes on its dollar holdings, and the fees it gets from printing currency. The central bank retains some amount from the surplus to boost its capital, but a large part of the amount is transfered to the government.
While the exact amount is ratified by the RBI’s central board in May, the government pencils in an amount beforehand for its budget calculation.
Bloomberg
Live Events
The likely bonanza comes at a crucial time as the government is trying to revive an economy weighed down by weak consumption, anemic private sector investments and moderating tax revenues.
Aastha Gudwani, an economist with Barclays Plc. said the bumper RBI dividend will help the government in partly offsetting “sluggish corporate tax revenue and a shortfall in divestment proceeds.” Standard Chartered Plc. Anubhuti Sahay expects the economy’s reliance on
RBI surplus transfer
to remain high, at around 0.5%-0.55% of gross domestic product, against the usual norm of 0.1%-0.4% of GDP.
The RBI has been selling dollars through the past year to cushion the depreciating rupee. It sold gross $196 billion of forex during April-November against $113 billion in the same period last year, according to IDFC First. The figure for the full financial year through March could be closer to $250 billion, estimates Sahay.
The dollar sales are profitable for the RBI as the greenbacks were acquired at a cheaper exchange rate in the past. The profits, however, are hard to quantify as the RBI doesn’t disclose the average acquisition value.
“The RBI is expected to maintain elevated dividend levels, likely around two trillion rupees, supported by increased income from
foreign exchange transactions
as it sold more dollars to stabilize the rupee in 2HFY25,”
ICICI Bank Ltd
. economists led by Sameer Narang wrote in a note.
Under former Governor
Shaktikanta Das
, the monetary authority built up a record reserve pool of $705 billion in September. The stockpile has since fallen to $626 billion as the central bank sold dollars to quell the rupee volatility in the wake of Donald Trump’s reelection as US President.
Trump’s pledge to impose hefty tariffs on imports into US boosted the dollar and sent other currencies tumbling. The rupee fell to a record low of 86.7025 earlier this month.
Full year earnings from foreign exchange transactions for RBI are estimated at 1.85 trillion rupees in the fiscal year as against 836 billion rupees in fiscal 2024, according to IDFC First estimates.
Some economists, however, said the dividend transfer could have been much higher but for the central bank’s need to set aside more money as provisions to account for an expanded balance sheet.
“The RBI may choose to transfer a higher amount to reserves for contingency provisions, which would reduce the dividends available,” wrote Nomura Holdings Inc. economists led by Sonal Varma in a note last week. “Overall, we do not expect any major adverse impact on the RBI’s dividend transfer to the government, though the quantum should be lower.”

CBDT: No Lens on investments under old tax treaties,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cbdt-no-lens-on-investments-under-old-tax-treaties/articleshow/117466280.cms,23-01-2025,"New Delhi: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (
CBDT
) has said that the
Principal Purpose Test
(PPT), which allows for deeper scrutiny of treaty benefits claimed by investors, will apply prospectively.
A guidance note issued by the country's apex direct taxes body clarified that past investments made under
tax treaties
with countries including Mauritius, Cyprus and Singapore will not be subject to PPT, bringing relief to investors.
The PPT, a globally accepted rule, aims to prevent large companies from avoiding taxes by scrutinising business arrangements that have been made purely for
tax benefits
as their main purpose. India is among the 140 nations which have signed the pact that provides for this rule.
The latest guidance note from the CBDT assumes significance in the backdrop of the amendment to the
India-Mauritius tax treaty
in April 2024 to include the PPT.
The amendment had unnerved foreign investors who had routed their investments from Mauritius as PPT would have allowed tax authorities to question benefits claimed under the tax treaty even if the benefits enjoyed grandfathering. The amended protocol, however, is yet to be notified.
Live Events
""The note clarifies various aspects for interpreting the Principal Purpose Test that has now been featured in most Indian tax DTAAs (
double taxation avoidance agreements
),"" said Rohinton Sidhwa, partner at Deloitte India. Most importantly, it establishes the primacy of the grandfathering article that features in some treaties (namely Cyprus, Mauritius and Singapore), he said.
""With this clarification, there is a likelihood that the protocol would be notified and go into effect in the coming financial year beginning April 1, 2025,"" Sidhwa said.
Akhilesh Ranjan, partner at PWC, said, ""The circular clarifies that the PPT rule will apply only to taxable events taking place after the rule or the amending protocol takes effect, and that the grandfathering provisions will be respected.""
However, he also said there is no complete immunity for past investments. ""PPT could still apply to investments made prior to 2017, if the circumstances warrant such application,"" Ranjan said.
""The application of PPT would more likely than not be a context-specific and fact-based exercise,"" said Vishwas Panjiar, partner, Nangia Andersen LLP.
He cited a recent example before the Delhi
Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal where the tax department, perhaps for the first time, invoked PPT in case of the India-Luxembourg DTAA.

Further, exemption has been provided for any income of a foreign company from lease rentals of cruise ships, received from a related company which operates such ship or ships in India.
As per the amendment to I-T Rules, 1962, notified on January 21, the applicability of this presumptive taxation regime is subject to conditions, including that the non-resident, engaged in the business of operation of cruise ships operate a passenger ship having a carrying capacity of more than 200 passengers or length of 75 metres or more, for leisure and recreational purposes and having appropriate dining and cabin facilities for passengers.
The conditions also include that the non-resident operate such ship on

CBDT
), has clarified that past investments made under certain tax treaties with countries like Mauritius,
Cyprus
, and Singapore will not be affected by a new rule called the
Principal Purpose Test
(PPT).
The circular issued Wednesday move puts to rest industry concerns that their past investments might be reopened for scrutiny and clarify this aspect of retrospective vs prospective application of the Protocol to avoid any confusion or unnecessary litigation.
This is a big relief for taxpayers and investors who do business across borders with these countries.
In April, 2024, India and Mauritius amended their double-taxation avoidance agreement and included a clause which said revenue authorities would now scrutinise the exemption available under the treaty as per the Principal Purpose Test laid down in the protocol.
What is principal purpose test?
In the global tax treaty, signed by both India and Mauritius, there is Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) rules under ‘pillar two’ model, which is crafted to ensure large MNCs pay a minimum level of tax on income arising in each jurisdiction they operate in.
Live Events
As per the BEPS rules there is provision to decline the shelter of a DTAA cover if the principal purpose of a business arrangement is to save tax and is gauged by using a Principal Purpose Test.
The protocol was amended in line with the provisions of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting that both countries have joined. Mauritius at that time had not included India as a treaty partner to whom the MLI would apply.
Both the country agreed to amend the treaty bilaterally.
Why this clarification is important?
The revised language in the amendment specifically stated that relief under the treaty cannot be for the indirect benefit of residents of another country.
This meant that revenue authorities would now scrutinise the exemption available under the treaty as per the Principal Purpose Test laid down in the protocol.
Experts that time pointed out that though the protocol would come in into force from a future date, based on past practice, it is likely to be applied even for shares acquired before April 1, 2017.
They feared it would be imperative for the FPIs to prove that there is a sufficient non-tax justification and commercial rationale for them to be based in Mauritius in order for them to claim the treaty benefit.

Union Budget will balance fiscal consolidation and growth; capital expenditure likely to rise to Rs11-11.5 lakh cr: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/union-budget-will-balance-fiscal-consolidation-and-growth-capital-expenditure-likely-to-rise-to-rs11-11-5-lakh-cr-report/articleshow/117442649.cms,22-01-2025,"The
Union Budget
for the fiscal year 2025-26, to be presented on February 1, 2025, is expected to strike a delicate balance between
fiscal consolidation
and growth-oriented measures, according to a
Bank of Baroda
report.
To encourage private investments, the government is likely to increase its capital expenditure to Rs11-11.5 lakh crore in FY26, up from Rs10 lakh crore in FY25.
Despite headwinds from slowing global growth, a stronger US dollar, and potential tariff threats by President-elect Donald Trump, the government aims to ensure India's growth trajectory remains resilient.
Key priorities include boosting domestic consumption, fostering private investments, and continuing flagship schemes such as PM-KISAN, MGNREGA, and Housing for All.
With an anticipated fiscal deficit reduction to 4.3-4.4 per cent of GDP in FY26 from 4.8-4.9 per cent in FY25, the government demonstrates a firm commitment to fiscal prudence.
Live Events
The report mentioned, ""For the fiscal year 2025-26, Union
budget
will skilfully balance fiscal consolidation, and measures for advancing growth. We expect centre to achieve or maybe even undershoot (by ~10bps) its fiscal deficit target of 4.9 per cent ( per cent of GDP), owing to expected savings on the expenditure side.""
This fiscal room will be supported by a normalizing nominal GDP growth of 10.5 per cent and stable revenue growth driven by revived consumption and rationalized subsidies.
The quality of expenditure will remain a focus, ensuring funds are allocated to enhance infrastructure, social schemes, and skilling programs.
Amid signs of moderation in real GDP growth and urban consumption, the budget is expected to prioritize both rural and urban growth.
Enhanced allocations for schemes like MGNREGA, PM-KISAN, and affordable housing are anticipated to support these goals.
The budget may also introduce new initiatives such as a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for MSMEs, increased funding for the Skill India program, and expanded infrastructure for electric vehicle (EV) charging and agricultural warehousing.
Tax incentives, such as higher standard deductions, increased limits under sections 80C and 80D, and measures to promote sustainable tourism and reduce customs duties, are also on the agenda.
While the overall subsidy burden is expected to decline slightly in FY26, food and fertilizer subsidies will remain significant to protect farmers and consumers.
The subsidy allocation is projected to reduce to Rs4 lakh crore from Rs4.2 lakh crore in FY25, with savings primarily from food subsidies. Despite higher costs for fertilizer imports due to a stronger dollar, the government aims to stabilize retail prices.
Revenue receipts are expected to stabilize in FY26, supported by buoyant indirect tax collections, particularly GST. Direct tax collections, however, may see slower growth due to subdued corporate tax receipts. Non-tax revenues, including the surplus transfer from the RBI, will continue to provide critical fiscal support.
The government is likely to keep its borrowing program relatively steady, with gross borrowing for FY26 projected at Rs15 lakh crore.
Net borrowing is expected to ease to Rs10.8 lakh crore, supported by savings from lower expenditure. With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) anticipated to begin a rate-cutting cycle in FY26, lower bond yields and deposit rates will further help reduce the debt burden.
Capital expenditure will remain a cornerstone of the budget, aimed at driving investments in infrastructure, health, education, and space technology.
The government plans to invest significantly in projects such as ports, railways, roads, and renewable energy, aligning with its vision of ""Viksit Bharat.""
Revenue expenditure is also expected to grow modestly, driven by higher allocations for schemes like PM-Awas Yojana and MGNREGA.

""The other thing which is interesting is this whole shift to AI,"" Aggarwal said. ""I think that also marks the shift from a product-based to a service-based world... India, which has historically had a strength in services, could benefit from this change.""
Sanjeev Krishan, chairman of accounting firm PwC India, said while incentives are promoting manufacturing, much work remains, particularly on the logistics side. He said some other countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, are doing better than India in manufacturing and digital competitiveness.
The panellists also highlighted the need for greater investments in skill development to attract global companies and investors to India.
""Look at the GCCs... They are now starting to struggle with the skilling element,"" Krishan said. ""That's something we need to focus on because India's demographic is India's strength, and we need to be able to harness it, which means there has to be a huge focus on skilling.""
He said the complexities around the GST continue to remain an issue among the global executives.
Another advantage India has is that global companies across sectors are viewing it as a promising market with great potential for growth, thanks to its demographic advantage, panellists noted. ""What gets people excited about India is this exponential scale. It's not incremental over the next 10 years,"" said Kartikeya Sharma, President, AB InBev India.
Niranjan Hiranandani, and managing director of real estate developer Hiranandani Group, noted that structural reforms in the commercial real estate sector have made it easier to attract FDI, with most states aligning their policies to facilitate this. Also, the return on investment (ROI) is higher in commercial realty than the residential sector, he said.
If the country can attract more FDI and internal funds into the real estate market, ""similar to what has been done in the capital markets, even if 10% of it is done, your GDP growth will grow from 6.5% to 10% in the next two years,"" Hiranandani said.

"Divestment, asset monetisation target for FY25 may be cut 40%",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/divestment-asset-monetisation-target-for-fy25-may-be-cut-40/articleshow/117340070.cms,17-01-2025,"The government will likely slash its disinvestment and
asset monetisation
target for the current fiscal to less than ₹30,000 crore in the revised estimate from the budgeted ₹50,000 crore, people aware of the deliberations said.
For the next fiscal, the target may be set at about ₹45,000-50,000 crore, as the government intends to conclude the
IDBI Bank
transaction and step up its asset monetisation bid, one of them told ET.
It will also continue to dilute its stakes in some entities via the offer-for-sale route, he added.
The government has stopped declaring a separate
disinvestment target
from the current fiscal. Instead, it has announced a combined disinvestment and asset monetisation goal.
Live Events
It has raked in ₹8,625 crore in disinvestment proceeds so far, this fiscal.
The government, which owns a 45.48% stake in IDBI Bank, is looking to divest 30.48%. State-run
Life Insurance Corporation of India
, too, plans to sell 30.24% of its 49.24% stake in the lender.
The central bank has already assessed the ""fit and proper"" candidates from the interested investors and financial bids are expected by the end of this fiscal, said one of the persons cited above.
At Friday's share price on the BSE, the sale of 30.48% stake in
IDBI Bank
could fetch the government ₹27,544 crore.
The centre has, in recent years, cut back on its aggressive sell-off strategy and raised focus on creating value and bolstering profitability at
central public sector enterprises
(CPSEs) so they can pay regular dividends to shareholders, including the government.
""Money is fungible. Whether it comes from disinvestment or dividend, it will have the same effect on the budget,"" a senior official had told ET earlier. Dividend receipts have surpassed the revised estimates for a third straight year through 2023-24.
Last month, the government said it was following a ""calibrated disinvestment strategy"" through the listing of CPSEs as well as gradual dilution of minority stakes through the stock market, ""aligned with the interest of minority shareholders.""
The review of the earlier strategy was spurred by the delay in privatisation bids as the strategic sale process remains time-consuming, and many factors - including market conditions and litigations by stakeholders - are beyond the government's control, officials said.

"Budget 2025: Govt should target capex of Rs 11 lakh cr in FY26, give relief to taxpayers in lower bracket, says ICRA",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/budget-2025-govt-should-target-rs-11-lakh-cr-in-fy26-give-relief-to-taxpayers-in-lower-bracket-says-icra/articleshow/117262859.cms,15-01-2025,"The government should target a capital spending of Rs 11 lakh crore in the Budget for the next fiscal while giving inflation-adjusted relief on personal
income tax
to boost consumer spending, rating agency
ICRA
said on Wednesday. ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said last year's record budgeted capital expenditure of Rs 11.11 lakh crore is likely to fall short by about Rs 1.4 lakh crore and the next year's target should be fixed at the last year's level with a focus on keeping borrowing within reasonable limits.
Further, Nayar said capex numbers are trailing the run rate required to get to the Budget target in the current fiscal.
Between April and November 2024, capex spending stood at Rs 5.13 lakh crore, 46 per cent of the Budget estimates of Rs 11.11 lakh crore.
""We are looking at a large shortfall in the current fiscal. For next year, we are hoping that we will get fiscal space to prioritise capex... For FY26, based on the revenue numbers...a fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent of GDP will be quite reasonably achieved. That would allow us Rs 11 trillion of capex, a growth of 11-12 per cent over the number that we think is feasible for FY25,"" Nayar told PTI in an interview.
She said putting in a larger capex number may not be ""prudent"" as a larger borrowing and fiscal deficit would push up yields.

She said the Budget for 2025-26 should put a ""realistic capex number"" upfront and if, during the course of the year, it looks like it will be over-achieved, then the government could take the supplementary demands for grants route to up the target.
To shield the economy from the impact of Covid, the government has been spending heavily on infrastructure and building capital assets. It earmarked Rs 4.39 lakh crore capex in 2020-21, which increased to Rs 5.54 lakh crore in 2021-22. In 2022-23, capex spending was hiked to Rs 7.5 lakh crore and in 2023-24, it reached Rs 10 lakh crore.
On being asked if the government would continue with the investment push in FY26 as well, Nayar said the capex push creates positivity in the economy and a virtuous cycle that trickles down to other parts of the economy as well.
""I would think that capex would be low in FY25 and the fiscal space available should be prioritised for capex. Our forecast suggests that every 10 basis points of additional fiscal deficit would get us another Rs 35,000 crore of capital expenditure. Probably better to start with a realistic capex number, a fiscal deficit that would come down in line with medium-term forecast that will give a reasonable borrowing figure for markets to absorb,"" Nayar said.

What the real estate sector is expecting from Union Budget 2025
ICRA forecasts a fiscal deficit, which is the difference between government expenditure and revenues, at 4.8 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal and 4.5 per cent in FY26.
Nayar also said that GDP growth has bottomed out in the September quarter and going forward, it is expected to recover. The ratings agency projects GDP growth of 6.5 per cent for both the current and next fiscal years.
She said rural consumption is expected to be steady, while urban consumption would be uneven. Once food inflation starts to recede, urban consumption may begin to see a bit of an uptick, she said.
On her expectations from the Budget, Nayar said some tinkering with income tax slabs and rates would give a ""mood upliftment"" for urban taxpayers. That is what the budget can bring in without too much revenue loss.

""Inflation does eat away disposable income. It is not an unfair ask (tax relief). While some modest concessions could be given in terms of tax relief, we need to make sure that we are not losing out too many people from the I-T net,"" she said, adding that two things will be important -- one, not to have too much revenue loss, and second, not to lose too many taxpayers from the tax net.
""Perhaps either a tinkering with the rates at the lower slab or sort of inflation adjustment of the slabs to give a little bit of relief right in the beginning. We can look at income tax filers continuing to file tax, while we are bringing in a slightly higher slab for the initial I-T bracket,"" Nayar said.
Currently, individual taxpayers can file their income tax returns (ITR) either under the old tax regime which offers benefit of deductions and exemptions, or under the new tax regime which offers a lower rate of taxes.
The 2024-25 Budget had hiked the standard deduction for salaried taxpayers to Rs 75,000, and the deduction on family pension for pensioners to Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime.
The new tax regime exempts income up to Rs 3 lakh. Those earning annually between Rs 3-7 lakh pay 5 per cent tax, Rs 7-10 lakh (10 per cent), Rs 10-12 lakh (15 per cent), Rs 12-15 lakh (20 per cent) and above Rs 15 lakh (30 per cent).
The old tax regime, however, exempts income up to Rs 2.5 lakh from taxes. Income from Rs 2.5-5 lakh attracts 5 per cent tax, and 20 per cent for income between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. A 30 per cent tax is levied on income above Rs 10 lakh.

Union budget
, the
Union home ministry
has capped the expenditure of the
Census Survey
and Statistics to about half of what was allocated in
Budget Estimates 2024-25
but has made a provision, saying the RGI can access more funds through a special route.
The Registrar General of India (RGI) is expected to hold the much delayed census and update the National Population Register this year and the Union finance ministry is likely to allocate for the same during the upcoming budget, according to officials. It will further change the future census cycles completely. As per the Revised Estimates (RE) for a census survey, a sum of ₹1.25013 crore was allocated during the
budget
estimates for 2024-25, however, a sum of ₹0.52209 crore has been earmarked in the Revised Estimates for 2024-25.
The order further noted, ""It may be ensured that the total expenditure under each head of account during the current financial year does not exceed the outlay indicated in the Revised Estimates 2024-25."" It added, ""Where the provision in RE has been reduced below the Budget Estimates (BE) provision, the expenditure may be kept within the RE outlay so fixed and where RE provision has been increased, it does not per se authorise expenditure beyond BE provision.""
The process enumerated in 2019 for Census 2020 got delayed due to Covid-19 and later general elections 2024. On the caste census, the government had earlier informed the
Parliament
that there is no plan to enumerate caste-wise data in Census 2021 other than the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
""The Government of India has not enumerated caste-wise populations other than SCs and STs in Census since Independence,"" the MHA had said in response to a Parliament question. ""We are also aware that several state assemblies have passed resolutions for caste-based census,"" explained another official. In 2018, the Modi government announced that Census 2021 envisages collecting data on OBC for the first time.

, the chief economist of
Axis Bank
, who is also a member of the
Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister

Comparing the situation with Japan of the 1980s, Mishra said India's northern neighbour will be ""spewing out"" a lot of capital given the very low yield of 1 per cent on government bonds and a negative
foreign direct investment
.
Mishra, a part-time member of the EACPM, acknowledged the sensitivities involved given the frosty ties between India and its northern neighbour, and also pointed to the ""
Press Note 3
"" of 2020 attempting to restrict flows from China.
""...if there are funds, and we already have like China Light and Power owns power plants in India. So it's not that we haven't seen that, but (Chinese) can be a very important source of capital,"" Mishra said while speaking at a conference organised by the Sebi-promoted NISM here.
Drawing parallels with Japan, Mishra said in the 1980s, Japan was being blamed for being too aggressive and concerns were also being raised about the country taking away jobs.

""As we think about a much more competitive world in terms of
capital flows
and tight financial conditions, I think these kind of parallel structures (like investments from China) will actually help us navigate,"" Mishra said.
Mishra said countries tend to slow down the economy in times when the currency is under pressure but advocated against India adopting such a stance.

Niti Aayog exploring ways to find balance between govt and corp debt markets: Bery,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/niti-aayog-exploring-ways-to-find-balance-between-govt-and-corp-debt-markets-bery/articleshow/117119406.cms,10-01-2025,"Niti Aayog
is exploring ways to realign the balance between the very deep
government debt market
and the
corporate debt market
, a top official said on Friday. The government think tank will also examine the possible impact of any moves which may be aimed at deepening the corporate debt market, its vice chairman
Suman Bery
said at an event here.
""A balance that we are going to have to get right is between corporate debt and government debt, and exactly what that takes in terms of both fiscal adjustment and in terms of the liquidity in the corporate debt market. These are issues that we have been exploring at Niti (Aayog),"" Bery said at an event organised by the Sebi-promoted NISM here.
The
government securities market
is very deep for many years now, helped by policies like a mandatory statuary liquidity ratio (SLR) for banks which ensures that the government has adequate resources to carry out its developmental agenda. There is also a very active secondary market where such bonds are traded.
As against that, a lot of efforts have gone into deepening the corporate debt market which can serve as an alternative to bank borrowing for entities.
The government's net borrowing for FY25 has been pegged at Rs 11.63 lakh crore, while entities have raised Rs 7.3 lakh crore from the corporate debt market in the first nine months of the fiscal.

Bery also said that along with rising income levels, there is a need to ensure that
financial literacy
reaches more people, which will include efforts to ensure that an ""excess focus"" on safety does not push people into riskier portfolios.
He said Sebi will have to ""aggressively"" embark on an
investor education
as the willingness of Indian households to move into the riskier world of
capital markets
gets established.
India can adopt an approach which is a blend between banking dominated system and the more riskier one dominated by capital markets, he said.
Explaining the two distinct approaches, Bery said the US approach is helmed by capital markets willing to back riskier ideas, while Europe has traditionally been a banking-system led one.

financial conditions in FY26
, according to an analysis by
India Ratings

volatile banking system
liquidity and domestic growth-inflation conundrums, the rating agency said in a report.
""In the milieu of external headwinds and weakening domestic credit conditions, the overall credit market is expected to see higher volatility and elevated spreads especially for the entities with a weak credit outlook,"" said Soumyajit Niyogi, director, core analytical group, India Ratings. ""Given the limited tailwinds from the monetary and fiscal space and cautious financing conditions, easing of
banking system liquidity
on a sustained basis and timely availability of risk capital have become critical.""
As per the report, due to weak macro and micro conditions, a sustained easing of the banking system liquidity has become necessary. Stable surplus liquidity will not only ease the pressure on banks'
lending rates
but also ensure ease of financing, it said.
The rating agency said that the large and frequent volatility in the banking system liquidity does not augur well for the financing conditions, especially when the overall environment is not so favourable. The high volatility in the banking system liquidity also acts as a deterrent for commercial banks in terms of addressing adverse loan-to-deposit ratios and asset liability pricing, it said.
India Ratings also forecast that while deposit rates in the banking system have peaked out, the structural shift in the system will keep the downward rigidity intact. As a result, it said, banks' lending rate is expected to elevate in FY26, though it could soften from the September quarter.

RBI adds 8 tons gold to its reserves in November 2024: WGC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-adds-8-tons-gold-to-its-reserves-in-nov-2024-wgc/articleshow/116997220.cms,06-01-2025,"Central banks around the world collectively, in November 2024, added 53 tonnes of
gold
to their reserves, of which the
Reserve Bank of India
's addition was 8 tonnes, the World Gold Council (WGC) said in a report on Monday. In 2024, central banks - mostly those from emerging markets - remained keen buyers of gold, driven by the need for a stable and secure asset amid global economic uncertainties.
""Assessing the final act of 2024, central banks around the world continued to play a leading role in the demand for gold. November represented another solid month of gold buying as central banks collectively added a net 53 tonnes to global official holdings,"" WGC said in a report - Central bank gold statistics November 2024.
The gold price dip in November, following the US election, may have provided some central banks with added impetus to accumulate, WGC said.
WGC further noted that the Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) continued with its 2024 buying streak, adding a further 8 tonnes to its
gold reserves
in November.

Diversifying assets: RBI strategy has a heart of gold,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/diversifying-assets-rbi-strategy-has-a-heart-of-gold/articleshow/116925658.cms,04-01-2025,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) has accelerated gold purchases since October to mitigate revaluation risks to its foreign exchange stockpile and minimise currency volatility, with a part of the reserves that have come off record highs since late September likely also being used to cushion the rupee's fall against the US dollar.
The central bank bought 20 tonnes of gold during October-November, compared with 30 tonnes during the first six months of the current financial year, showed an ET analysis of latest RBI data. ""The buying of gold by central banks is driven by the need to diversify assets in which forex reserves are held,"" Gaura Sengupta, chief economist at IDFC Bank, told ET. ""The high concentration of foreign currency assets in securities such as short-tenor US treasuries opens up risks of revaluation loss when US Treasury yields rise.""
Rarely Traded
Cumulatively, the central bank has bought 50 tonnes of gold so far in FY25.
RBI's gold reserves are at 876.18 tonnes as of November 29, 2024. This financial year, gold prices have risen 19%. But prices were relatively stable in the two months during which RBI stepped up its gold purchases.
Live Events
Significantly, unlike many of its peers - such as the central banks of Turkiye, Switzerland or China -RBI seldom sells gold, as it is a politically difficult decision. World Gold Council data showed that gold's share in India's foreign exchange reserves is one of the highest among major central banks, at more than 10%.
As of September, 83.5% of India's foreign currency assets were held in securities and the rest in deposits with other central banks and the Bank for International Settlements.
""While safety and liquidity constitute the twin objectives of reserve management in India, return optimisation is kept in view within this framework,"" RBI said in its latest half-yearly report on the 'Management of Foreign Exchange Reserves.'
India's foreign exchange reserves declined $47 billion between end-September, when both the stockpile and equity indices had hit record highs, and end November. The bulk of the fall in reserves is attributed to valuation losses.
""Another risk of revaluation loss rises during periods of dollar strength. Currently, central banks are facing both rising US Treasury yields and dollar strength, resulting in substantial revaluation loss,"" Sengupta said. ""The diversification of forex reserves into gold is aimed at reducing the risk of revaluation loss.""

No cause for concern over sufficiency of GST cess fund: Finance Ministry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/no-cause-for-concern-over-sufficiency-of-gst-cess-fund-finance-ministry/articleshow/116893400.cms,02-01-2025,"New Delhi: The
finance ministry
Thursday said there is no cause for concern regarding the sufficiency of the
compensation cess
fund under Goods and Services Tax (GST), and that the Centre is on track to meet all related compensation and repayment obligations.
It said that the cess fund could generate some surplus after all obligations are met.
The ministry added that the Centre remains committed to ensuring that states receive their due compensation, and that the repayment of the
back-to-back loans
is completed in accordance with the established timelines.
""It is expected that the entire loan will be repaid before March 2026, with a minor surplus projected in the cess account, which will be shared equally between the Centre and states,"" the finance ministry said in a written statement, responding to a report that appeared on Tuesday.
The ET report had said ""GST Cess May Fall Short of 1.37 L Cr by Mar 31,"" citing data from a submission to the parliamentary standing committee on finance.
Live Events
Detailing the situation with the cess, the ministry added that the budget estimates for compensation cess for the
fiscal year
are Rs 1.51 lakh crore, with collections reaching Rs 1 lakh crore by November 2024, representing 66% of the target and a 7% growth compared with last year.
""This indicates that collections are on track to meet the target, dispelling concerns of a shortfall,"" the statement said.
A significant portion of the cess is being used to repay the back-to-back loans, with ₹92,087 crore repaid in FY 2023-24 and ₹1.34 lakh crore planned for FY 2024-25, the ministry added.
The compensation cess is levied on sin goods such as tobacco, aerated drinks, and some other items in the highest 28% tax bracket under GST. Proceeds from the cess are used to compensate states for any revenue loss on account of the transition to GST for five years since the rollout of the indirect tax in July 2017, as assured in the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017. The Centre has borrowed and released to states ₹1.1 lakh crore in 2020-21 and ₹1.59 lakh crore in 2021-22, after having raised the funds in back-to-back loans, to meet a part of the shortfall in cess collection.
Subsequently, it extended the compensation on sin goods from July 1, 2022, to March 31, 2026, and said that the collections would be used to pay the principal and interest on the back-to-back loans taken by the Centre to compensate the states during the pandemic period.
There is an additional component of ₹13,000 crore as final payment to the state, of which the Centre has disbursed ₹5,508 crore. The remaining compensation will be paid once audited accounts from six states are received, said the finance ministry.

The revenue distribution for December includes ₹32,836 crore from Central GST, ₹40,499 crore from State GST, ₹47,783 crore from Integrated GST, and ₹11,471 crore from cess.

GST cess may fall short of Rs 1.37 lakh crore for states compensation; Centre likely to meet shortfall,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-cess-may-fall-short-of-rs-1-37-lakh-crore-for-states-compensation/articleshow/116843548.cms,01-01-2025,"The goods and services tax (GST) compensation cess fund could face a shortfall of ₹1.37 lakh crore by March 31, with the Centre looking to clear the interest of ₹50,000 crore due on the back-to-back loans taken during the Covid period, officials said. Those loans had been taken to meet the shortfall in the fund at that time.
The Centre may have to pay additional final compensation of ₹13,000 crore to states in the current fiscal year after reconciliation of audited accounts, the officials said.
A compensation cess is levied on sin goods such as tobacco, aerated drinks and others in the highest 28% tax bracket under GST. The proceeds from the cess are used to compensate states for any revenue loss on account of the transition to GST for five years since the roll out of the indirect tax in July 2017. It was extended till March 31, 2026, to pay for the principal and interest on the back-to-back loans.
Payment of additional compensation is pending in cases where states have not furnished the Auditor General's certificate, or where reconciliation of accounts and payment is under process after submission of the certificate, an official said. Eight states are yet to submit the AG's certificate for their FY22 accounts. The Centre has asked them to submit it by January 31, so that the pending amount can be reconciled and released.
The Centre, however, is confident that cess collections until March 31, 2026, will be able to make up for the shortfall. ""As we will close the financial year, the compensation fund account will have a shortfall of ₹1.37 lakh crore but then we have 12 more months to collect cess which will take care of the shortfall ,"" a senior official told ET.

RBI seen loosening stranglehold on rupee in 2025,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-seen-loosening-stranglehold-on-rupee-in-2025/articleshow/116793053.cms,30-12-2024,"MUMBAI: The
Reserve Bank of India
will need to rethink its
foreign exchange strategy
and loosen its hold on the rupee in 2025, economists said, with the currency at its strongest against peers in at least two decades in trade-weighted terms.
The rupee's 40-currency trade-weighted real effective exchange rate (
REER
) stood at 108.14 in November, indicating the currency was overvalued by around 8%, the Reserve Bank of India's latest bulletin showed.
The rupee's overvaluation relative to its trading partners makes India's exports more expensive. This is the most overvalued the rupee has been since 2004,
RBI
data showed. Data prior to 2004 is not available.
The rupee's overvaluation on a REER basis reflects its appreciation in nominal terms against its peers and the widening interest rate differentials, economists said.
The former is largely thanks to a central bank that has intervened regularly in the forex markets to slow the pace of rupee's decline, keeping volatility in check.

In fact, the RBI's repeated two-sided intervention this year has meant the rupee has been the least volatile Asian currency after the pegged Hong Kong dollar.
But that could change in 2025.
""Given the rise in rupee's overvaluation...the pace of
RBI forex intervention
will need to slow,"" said Gaura Sen Gupta, India economist at
IDFC FIRST Bank
. That would mean the currency is likely to weaken and witness higher volatility.
There is already evidence of this. The rupee's 30-day daily realised volatility is at a six-month high and the currency is on course to post its biggest monthly decline in two years having dropped 1.2% so far in December.
Last Friday, the rupee dropped to an all-time low of 85.8075 against the U.S. dollar and traded in a 50-paisa range, the widest this year.
Considering the ""flagging"" overvaluation, there is likely to be further rupee depreciation, said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at
Union Bank of India
.
MULTIPLE HEADWINDS
A shallow rate cut cycle by the U.S. Federal Reserve, worries over the likely impact of Donald Trump's trade policies, rising U.S. bond yields and India's growth slowdown will be challenges for the rupee.
""It is after several years that both 'pull' (growth slowdown) and 'push' factors (external headwinds) for portfolio flows are not in favour of the rupee,"" said Dhiraj Nim, an economist and FX rates strategist at ANZ. ""So, an adjustment is warranted.""
NEW RBI GOVERNOR
The appointment of
Sanjay Malhotra
as the RBI's new governor earlier this month, a development that market participants had not expected, is further fuelling expectations of a change in how the rupee is managed.
""The RBI governor plays an important role in driving the central bank's currency management strategy,"" Nomura said in a note released immediately after the change in guard at RBI.
""It is possible that a bit more flexibility is allowed in currency fluctuations, going forward, as compared to the relatively tighter leash seen over the last one year and more.""

Non-profits have to also share their receipt and payment accounts with the government along with the audited accounts.
Several non-government organisations whose licenses under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act - a stern and oft-invoked law - expire on December 31, have learnt about the new compliance requirements after logging on to the
FCRA portal
hosted by the ministry of home affairs which frames the regulations.
Also, applicants must now scan the original copy of their constitution even if it is in a language other than English and make sure that the documents uploaded are legible and not blurred. With the government delaying FCRA renewals of a number of NGOs and questioning the intent of some of the overseas donors during the past few years - amid suspicions that funds were spent on activities unrelated to the stated purposes or amounts spent on administrative expenditure breached the regulatory limit - the new conditions would make key NGO officials more accountable and cautious.
According to Dr Gautam Shah, partner of the CA firm Gautam Shah & Associates, which advises many trusts, the additional requirements for new applications and renewal of FCRA are a welcome, but never in the past were they proposed or discussed. ""If it was conveyed to the trusts that these conditions would have to be followed at the time of application, a lot of time would have been saved. Getting FCRA registration or renewal is very difficult. For better governance a separate helpline or email or any other social media channel should be provided to address the grievances of applicants,"" said Shah.

ALIGNING WITH GLOBAL PRACTICES?
Practitioners like Isha Sekhri, partner at the CA firm Ajay Sekhri and Co think that the further tightening of KYC norms is a step to align with global best practices in compliance and transparency. ""Mandating the chief functionary's signature on every page of key documents ensures accountability and reduces the risk of document manipulation. Also, the shift to a year-wise activity report, instead of a generic summary brings granularity to the evaluation of an organisation's operational history and the use of foreign contributions.While the norms may demand more rigorous compliance efforts, they would ensure that foreign contributions are managed with integrity and aligned to their intended purposes,"" said Sekhri.
However, there is always a lurking fear among NGOs over how the law would be invoked to stop foreign donations. Among other things, what fuelled the debate since 2020 was the allegation that dollar donations were being diverted to lure the poor to embrace a new faith.
TACKLING TAX
Of late, some of the NGOS are also facing a tax issue. A charitable trust is entitled to exemption for accumulation of income and for amounts spent by it. So, if a NGO spends 85% of its income, the entire income is exempt from tax. If spending in any year is less than 85% of its income, it can choose to accumulate the shortfall amount to be spent for specific purposes within the next 5 years. According to Gautam Nayak, partner at CNK & Associates, which advises several charitable trusts, ""Till AY 2022-23, this accumulated amount could be spent in the year following the completion of 5 years, and if not spent, it would be taxable in the sixth year.

Other recommended steps include unbundling the
electricity supply industry
and privatizing power generation and distribution. These measures, the report noted, are crucial for enhancing the
financial health of DISCOMs
and, by extension, improving the overall quality of State finances.
It added, ""Unbundling the electricity supply industry, and privatising generation and distribution remain critical and would significantly improve the quality of State finance.""
Despite multiple financial restructuring efforts, the report highlighted that the DISCOMs' total outstanding debt has grown at an average annual rate of 8.7 per cent since 2016-17.
The report also outlined that the states need to prioritise operational efficiency by minimising distribution losses, improving metering systems, ensuring timely tariff revisions, and incentivising the power sector to gradually reduce reliance on government subsidies
This reflects an improvement from previous years and demonstrates a commitment to responsible financial management.
Additionally, the report also mentioned that the States have made progress in improving expenditure quality.
On a more positive note, the
RBI report
observed that States have made strides in maintaining fiscal discipline. In 2023-24, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) of States was contained at 2.91 per cent of GDP, staying well within the 3 per cent limit set by the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL).
The capital outlay, which is a critical indicator of investment in infrastructure and long-term growth, rose to 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2023-24, up from 2.2 per cent in the previous year.
Looking ahead, the report projects that States are expected to maintain fiscal discipline in 2024-25, with the GFD budgeted at 3.2 per cent of GDP.

Funds devolved to states under 15th Finance Commission higher: Finance Minister,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/funds-devolved-to-states-under-15th-finance-commission-higher-finance-minister/articleshow/116512762.cms,20-12-2024,"Funds devolved to states under the 15th Finance Commission (2021-2024) is more than what was devolved under the 14th Finance Commission (2015-20), finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said on Friday. In a pre-budget meeting with states, Sitharaman remarked that because of healthy macroeconomic environment, buoyancy and efficiency in the tax collections, the devolution has increased.
""The funds devolved to the states in the last 45 months (April 2021 to December 2024) under the 15th Finance Commission is more than what was devolved in 60 months under the 14th Finance Commission (2015-20),"" an official statement quoting Sitharaman said.
The Union finance minister also referred to the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI), which was first announced in the Union Budget 2020-21, and acknowledged that it has received a very good response from states.
States have been requesting the Central government to enhance the outlay under the scheme as it is leading to construction of crucial capital assets.
Sitharaman stated that the Centre has allocated an additional amount of approximately Rs 30,000 crore as 'Untied Funds' under the SASCI-2024-25.
Live Events
This allocation may be used by state governments in any sector to further increase expenditure on creation of capital assets.
In addition to this, the Union finance minister stated that the Centre has created an additional dispensation under SASCI for the states affected by disaster of a severe nature as assessed by the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT), deputed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
This will aid the states in their efforts for reconstruction of the damaged infrastructure, like roads and bridges, water supply lines, electricity poles, and culverts etc.
Sitharaman said the states which suffered a natural disaster of severe nature (as assessed by IMCT) in FY25 may be eligible for up to 50 per cent of their allocation under Part-1 (Untied) of the
SASCI scheme
.
This amount will be in addition to the funds provided under the National Disaster Response and Mitigation Fund (NDRMF), Sitharaman added.
Many states in the pre-budget meeting with Sitharaman demanded an increase in
disaster relief funding
in the upcoming budget for 2025-26.

CBDT launches campaign to intimate taxpayers on mismatch in ITR filed and AIS,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cbdt-launches-campaign-to-intimate-taxpayers-on-mismatch-in-itr-filed-and-ais/articleshow/116395606.cms,17-12-2024,"New Delhi: The
income tax department
on Tuesday said it is sending SMS and emails to taxpayers and non-filers where it has identified mismatch between transactions reported in
Annual Information Statement
(AIS) and income disclosed in ITRs for the financial years 2023-24 and 2021-22. In a statement, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said it has launched an electronic campaign to assist taxpayers in resolving mismatches between the income and transactions reported in the AIS and those disclosed in Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the financial years 2023-24 and 2021-22.
This campaign also targets individuals who have taxable income or significant
high-value transactions
reported in their AIS but have not filed ITRs for the respective years.
The initiative is part of the implementation of the e-Verification Scheme, 2021.
As part of this campaign, informational messages have been sent via SMS and email to taxpayers and non-filers where mismatches have been identified between transactions reported in AIS and ITRs filed.
Annual Information Statement (AIS) is comprehensive view of information for a taxpayer. Taxpayers can access AIS on the income tax department portal and provide feedback on information displayed in AIS. AIS shows both reported value and modified value (i.e. value after considering taxpayer feedback).
Live Events
The CBDT said that the purpose of this campaign is to remind and guide individuals who may not have fully disclosed their income in their ITRs to take this opportunity to file revised or belated ITRs for FY 2023-24, the last date of which is December 31.
For cases pertaining to FY 2021-22, taxpayers can file updated ITRs by the limitation date of March 31, 2025.
Taxpayers can also provide their feedback, including disagreeing with the information reported in the AIS, through the AIS portal accessible via the e-filing website.
Last month, the CBDT launched a campaign under which messages were sent to taxpayers who have not disclosed high-value foreign income or assets in their ITRs for AY 2024-25.
These messages were intended for individuals identified through information received under bilateral and multilateral agreements, suggesting that they may hold foreign accounts or assets, or have received income from foreign jurisdictions.

UPI becomes top transaction mode in rural, semi-urban India: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-is-scanning-qr-codes-upi-becomes-top-transaction-mode-in-rural-semi-urban-india-report/articleshow/116392323.cms,17-12-2024,"Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has emerged as the most preferred mode of financial transactions for
rural and semi-urban India
, according to a new report released by
EY
and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).
The report, titled ‘
Financial Inclusion
through Technology and Literacy in India: Strategies for Sustainable Growth’, was launched at CII’s Annual Technology Summit in New Delhi.
Based on a survey of 1,033 respondents, the report highlights UPI’s growing adoption, with 38% of respondents from rural and semi-urban areas choosing it as their primary transaction mode. Preference for UPI was notably higher among individuals aged 18 to 35. However, 19% of respondents still relied solely on cash, while 11% did not prefer UPI at all.
The report also emphasised a strong savings culture, with 96% of respondents expressing a willingness to save and invest, presenting financial institutions an opportunity to offer customised investment products. Additionally, 55% of participants showed interest in learning financial management, covering savings, budgeting, loans, and insurance.
While digital payment adoption grows, trust in traditional banking remains strong. The survey found that 86% of account holders in rural and semi-urban regions still prefer visiting physical bank branches. For loans, 60% of borrowers use formal banking channels.
Live Events
Saurabh Chandra, Senior Partner & Financial Services (Domestic) Consulting Head at EY India, said, “As India moves towards becoming a $5 trillion economy, financial inclusion must be at the core of this growth strategy. Our report’s findings suggest a fertile ground for financial institutions to introduce innovative saving and investment solutions, particularly in rural and semi-urban India, where there is inclination to learn about financial management. Technology, coupled with
financial literacy
, has the potential to empower millions of individuals.”
The report further revealed significant gender gaps in financial literacy and digital access. While 69% of women use
digital banking services
, only 44% transact regularly. Awareness of government financial inclusion schemes remains uneven, with 18% of women unaware of initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and Atal Pension Yojana (APY).
Highlighting the role of technology, Vijay Rai, Chairman – CII Delhi Panel on Emerging Technologies & IT/ITES, stated, “Technology and financial literacy are transforming India's financial landscape. The shift towards digital payments is evident, but we must focus on empowering under-banked communities with the tools and knowledge they need to thrive in this evolving ecosystem.”
The report calls for short-term initiatives to understand the unbanked segments and improve their access to financial tools through technology and literacy programs. For long-term impact, it suggests building a tech-driven financial ecosystem leveraging AI and automation to deliver personalised and secure financial services.
The findings underline the need for a collaborative approach involving financial institutions, policymakers, and technology providers to drive sustainable financial inclusion and economic growth in rural and semi-urban India.

"India's fiscal deficit will be 4.8 pc in FY25, below budget estimate of 4.9 pc: CareEdge Ratings",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-fiscal-deficit-will-be-4-8-pc-in-fy25-below-budget-estimate-of-4-9-pc-careedge-ratings/articleshow/116352253.cms,16-12-2024,"New Delhi: The fiscal deficit of the central government is projected to be 4.8 per cent of GDP for FY25, slightly below the budgeted estimate of 4.9 per cent, according to a report by CareEdge Ratings. The marginal improvement is attributed to healthy tax collections, despite certain shortfalls.
It said ""Overall, we project the fiscal deficit at 4.8 per cent of GDP, marginally lower than the budgeted 4.9 per cent"".
The report also noted that the Gross tax revenue has seen strong performance in goods and services tax (GST) and income tax collections. These gains have helped cushion the impact of weaker collections in corporate tax and union excise duties.
However, the Centre's capital expenditure (capex) is expected to fall short of its target by Rs 1.5 trillion, which could impact long-term infrastructure growth. At the same time, revenue expenditure might exceed budget estimates due to additional allocations under the first supplementary grant.
It said ""Gross tax revenue supported by healthy performance in GST and income tax collection. This has helped partially offset the weakness in corporate tax and union excise duty collections"".
Live Events
The report noted that the nominal GDP growth is estimated to be lower at 9.9 per cent, compared to the budgeted 10.5 per cent for FY25. Despite this moderation, India's real GDP growth is expected to remain healthy at 6.5 per cent in FY25. The report also predicts moderation in consumer price index (CPI) inflation, as food prices stabilize.
The central government is anticipated to maintain its fiscal consolidation efforts, keeping the fiscal deficit trajectory on track.
On the external front, India's export performance is expected to be mixed. Merchandise exports are projected to grow modestly by 2.5 per cent in FY25, as global uncertainties weigh on demand.
However, services exports are forecast to grow robustly by 13 per cent, supported by sectors like IT and professional services. Additionally, remittances are likely to remain strong, further aiding the current account balance.
India's current account deficit (CAD) is projected to remain manageable at 0.9 per cent of GDP for FY25, reflecting resilience in the external sector.
Overall, the report paints a balanced picture of the economy, with positive tax revenue trends and services exports offsetting some challenges in capex and merchandise trade.

"India must do more to tax its super-rich, France's Piketty says",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-must-do-more-to-tax-its-super-rich-frances-piketty-says/articleshow/116296525.cms,16-12-2024,"India should do more to tax its super-rich given its high levels of inequality, French economist and author Thomas Piketty said on Friday.
The writer of the best-selling book ""Capital in the 21st Century"" called on India to follow through on a July pledge by
finance
ministers from the Group of 20 major economies to cooperate on effectively taxing the world's largest fortunes.
""India should be active in taxing the rich,"" Piketty said at an event organised by Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) and the Delhi School of Economics.
He said India could raise annual revenue worth 2.73% of its
gross domestic product
by imposing a 2% wealth tax on people with assets of more than 100 million rupees ($1.18 million), and a 33% inheritance tax on property worth at least the same amount.
The proportion of national income held by the top 1% richest Indians now surpassed that of their counterparts in the United States and Brazil, Piketty said, citing a 2024 report he co-authored, published by the World Inequality Lab.
Live Events
In 2022-23, he added, the richest 1% of India's population controlled 22.6% of the national income and held 40.1% of the nation's total wealth.
Speaking at the same event, the Indian government's chief economic adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, opposed Piketty's call, saying higher taxes could lead to higher outflows.
India's government abolished a wealth tax in 2015 and has since rejected calls for its return or the introduction of an inheritance tax.
In April, Indian Finance Minister

The first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2024-25 was tabled in the Lok Sabha by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary to seek approval of Parliament to authorise gross additional expenditure of Rs 87,762.56 crore.
Of this, proposals involving net cash outgo aggregate to Rs 44,142.87 crore and gross additional expenditure, matched by savings of the Ministries/ Departments or enhanced receipts/recoveries, aggregates to Rs 43,618.43 crore.
The additional spending includes Rs 6,593.73 crore towards the fertiliser subsidy scheme, about Rs 9,000 crore for agriculture and farmer welfare, and Rs 8,000 crore towards defence spendings.
It also includes expenditure of Rs 3,000 crore towards expenditure by the Ministry of External Affairs and Rs 4,800 crore towards expenditure by Home Ministry.
ICRA
Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said the net cash outgo under the first Supplementary Demand for Grants is relatively modest and could end up being offset by savings in departments other than those included in this supplementary, for instance, capital expenditure.
Live Events
""We don't see this additional expenditure as posing a risk to the achievement of the fiscal deficit target, given the expectations of capex undershooting the budgeted amount by at least Rs 1 lakh crore,"" Nayar said.

Tax refunds up by 46.31% to Rs 3.08 lakh crore in FY 2024-25: Finance Ministry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/tax-refunds-up-by-46-31-to-rs-3-08-lakh-crore-in-fy-2024-25-finance-ministry/articleshow/116238152.cms,12-12-2024,"The
Finance Ministry
announced on Thursday a significant improvement in the issuance of tax refunds for the financial year 2024-25.
Between April 1 and November 27 this year refunds amounting to Rs 3.08 lakh crore were issued, marking a 46.31 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2023.
It also stated that at its peak this year the Income Tax Return portal handled more than 900 filings in a second and nearly 70 lakh ITRs (Income Tax Returns) in a day. This year more than 1.62 crore ITRs were processed in a single day for A.Y. 2024-25.
As the year 2024 comes to an end, the ministry shared the prominent initiatives or announcements it had undertaken this year.
It said ""Highest filing of ITRs in one day 69.93 lakh ITRs filed on 31st July 2024. 8.50 cr ITR filed till 22.11.24 which is 7.32 per cent higher than ITRs filed for the corresponding period of the preceding year""
Live Events
A special initiative was undertaken to address 35 lakh failed refund cases from various assessment years, ensuring refunds were processed for validated bank accounts. This step not only expedited the issuance of pending refunds but also streamlined the overall process.
In the corresponding period last year between 1st April 2023 and 30 November 2023, refunds totalling Rs 2.03 lakh crore were issued, reflecting the ministry's concerted efforts to expedite the process this year. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (
CBDT
) played a crucial role in achieving this milestone.
Last year the ministry noted that the introduction and enablement of the
TIN 2.0
platform have been a game-changer in achieving these results. Over 3 crore refunds were credited using TIN 2.0, with an impressively low error rate of just 0.002 per cent.
The ministry highlighted the importance of these refunds in ensuring liquidity for taxpayers and promoting trust in the tax administration.
The increased efficiency and higher refund disbursement demonstrate the government's commitment to improving taxpayer services and leveraging technology for enhanced governance.
The significant rise in refunds is expected to provide relief to individual taxpayers and businesses alike, contributing to overall economic activity and compliance.
With the successful implementation of TIN 2.0, the government aims to sustain and further improve its performance in the coming years. (ANI)

Japan's megabanks are flush with cash and hunting overseas deals. On their radar? India.,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/japans-megabanks-are-flush-with-cash-and-hunting-overseas-deals-on-their-radar-india-/articleshow/116160390.cms,10-12-2024,"Japan
’s megabanks are awash in cash and eager to invest.
Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and
Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. are enjoying record earnings. Selling off cross-shareholdings is bringing in even more money. Even as they reward shareholders with buybacks and higher dividends, they are determined to fund overseas expansion.
Their primary focuses are on the US and India, respectively the world’s largest economy and the fastest-growing. While the banks have had a presence in the two countries for decades, this year has seen a fresh push in investment and hiring. Buying stakes in local companies also puts their excess funds to work as the banks are under pressure from the
Tokyo Stock Exchange
to boost their valuations.
“Their investment strategy including M&A is key to whether the banks can reach the next level of growth,” said Nana Otsuki, a senior fellow at Pictet Asset Management Japan Ltd. “Given their price-to-book ratios still aren’t comfortably above one, it’s a priority to better utilize their capital.”
All of the companies have more cash on their balance sheets than their target common equity tier 1 ratios and have plans to reduce their strategic holdings over the next several years. MUFG aims to cut its stakes in clients by at least 700 billion yen ($4.7 billion) by March 2027.
SMFG
has a similar plan to dispose of 600 billion yen in such holdings by March 2029 and Mizuho’s aim is to reduce its cross shareholding by 300 billion yen by March 2026.

“We are now moving from the stage of capital buildup to the stage of striking a balance between growth investment and enhanced shareholder returns,” said Mizuho CEO Masahiro Kihara at an investor presentation on Nov 15.
Bloomberg
In the race to deploy their excess capital, the hottest area for all three banks has been India. The country’s strong economic growth is fueling demand for loans to fund capital expenditure across industries. Consumer demand is creating additional opportunities for lending and a record amount of money is set to be raised in initial public offerings this year.
MUFG has singled the country out as a specific pillar of its Asia growth strategy. It has aggressively courted India’s top conglomerates including Reliance Industries and the Adani Group. The bank has a goal of doubling its loan exposure in India to about $30 billion over the next several years. MUFG and its Japanese rivals plan to keep business ties with Adani Group despite founder Gautam Adani facing bribery charges in the US.
Japan’s largest bank took a strategic investment with a $333 million stake in DMI Finance Pvt Ltd. That deal valued the Indian shadow bank at $3 billion. MUFG has made clear though that it’s appetite is much larger.
“If there are good opportunities, we can spend big money,” said Yasushi Itagaki, head of MUFG’s global commercial banking business, adding multi-billion deals are possible. He was commenting on both India and the bank’s expansion into the Asian digital industry and declined to talk about specific deals.
India’s white-hot market for IPOs is also drawing in the Japanese. Mizuho and Nomura Holdings Inc. are the leading bidders to buy control of Avendus Capital Pvt., one of the country’s biggest investment banks. The two companies are jockeying to purchase a 63% stake from KKR & Co., which is seeking at least $400 million, according to people familiar with the situation.
Bloomberg
Retail loans for India’s growing middle class are another area where Japanese lenders anticipate high demand over the next decade. The country experienced strong credit growth in the last few quarters as retail customers borrowed for everything from buying homes and vehicles to funding holidays and impulse purchases. SMFG, Japan’s second-largest lender, spent $700 million in March to take full control of the local company formerly known as Fullerton India Credit Co. after first buying a $2 billion stake in 2021. The unit specializes in housing and car loans. Like MUFG, SMFG has singled India out as a key focus because of its high growth potential.
“We will keep allocating necessary resources to capture its high economic growth,” said Yoshihiro Hyakutome, Sumitomo Mitsui’s co-head of global banking unit.
Mizuho is also chasing Indian retail consumers. In February, it announced a deal to buy 15% in Kisetsu Saison Finance（India）Pvt. Ltd., an Indian unit of a Japanese financial company Credit Saison for about $145 million. In corporate and investment banking, Mizuho has also held internal discussions about focusing on winning firms that invest in private businesses, according to people familiar with the talks.
Apart from India, MUFG has made it a priority to invest in fintech companies in other Asian countries. The move represents a major shift in MUFG’s growth strategy in the region, where the bank has spent billions to buy big commercial banks in Thailand and Indonesia.
This year, the bank announced investments of $195 million in Thailand’s Ascend Money Co. and $393 million in the Philippines’ Globe Fintech Innovations Inc., both digital payment companies.
“In the power dynamics of Asia’s unicorn industry, they can raise funds from anywhere,” said MUFG’s Itagaki. “So they are examining who is the best to team up with to boost their value.”
MUFG and SMFG have submitted separate preliminary proposals to buy PT Bank Pan Indonesia, according to people familiar with the matter. Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd. is also a suitor for the Jakarta-listed bank known as Panin Bank.
The US
The banks are following a different strategy in North America. There they are focusing on growth in corporate and investment banking, providing financing and advising companies and institutional clients. The playbook is the one pioneered by MUFG with its investment in Morgan Stanley in 2008, leaning hard on the experience and connections of a US partner.
Mizuho was the latest major bank to adopt this tactic with the completion of its purchase of the investment bank Greenhill & Co. for $550 million last December. It has been on a hiring spree since then, adding bankers for various sectors including financial institutions, health care and infrastructure.
“The Americas is the largest fee pool and Mizuho was historically underrepresented” in M&A advisory, said Jerry Rizzieri, CEO of Mizuho Securities USA. “Our objective is to be firmly entrenched as one of the top 10 corporate and investment banks in the Americas.”
In addition to fees, M&A advisory brings in other banking businesses, such as bridging loans, and underwriting bond issues as deal-making clients seek to finance acquisitions, according to Mizuho officials.
Mizuho has improved its position in some key areas this year, cracking the top ten rankings in several markets. In US corporate bonds, it jumped three spots to #7. In US loans, it rose four spots to #9 and it also ranked #8 in US investment grade corporate bonds, up a notch from the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Our product lineup allows us to access about 80% of CIB fee pool in the US,” said Hidekatsu Take, Mizuho’s deputy president and head of global corporate and investment banking.
Bloomberg
At an earnings briefing in November, Mizuho CEO Kihara said the bank may consider further acquisitions after completing the post-merger integration of Greenhill. He also said investments in asset managers are possible, like what the bank did with private credit manager Golub Capital.
SMFG and
Jefferies
Financial Group Inc. are expanding their partnership and working together on corporate and investment banking deals. In the alliance, the Japanese bank brings its balance sheet and debt capital markets expertise while Jefferies adds M&A advisory and equity financing services. They have jointly worked on about 130 deals including M&A and debt and equity underwriting over the 12 months ending in September, compared with 30 deals as of September, 2023.
The two banks served as financial advisers to US property developer Alliance Residential Co. when it sold a minority stake to Japanese homebuilder Daiwa House Industry Co. Sumitomo Mitsui said the bank’s relationship with Daiwa and Jefferies’ ties with Alliance were utilized for the origination of the deal.
MUFG is expanding the areas of collaboration with Morgan Stanley in the US to the middle market, where the two companies aim to win more businesses in loans, M&A advisory and IPOs targeting smaller companies than they have been banking with so far. The company also recently hired a pair of senior bankers to expand the bank’s presence with mid-sized healthcare companies.
The Japanese banks’ overseas buildup has not been without setbacks. In 2021, MUFG agreed to sell its US regional lender Union Bank to U.S. Bancorp for $8 billion after it determined the unit lacked the scale to keep up with local competition amid growing IT and other necessary spending. The move sent shockwaves through the industry at the time, since Union Bank had long been considered a crown jewel of MUFG’s US operations.
The megabanks “have been doing overseas businesses for years but they haven’t quite done truly globalized management,” said Hideyasu Ban, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “It’s still a challenge for them to secure good local talent and manage them effectively from Tokyo.”

Need to go beyond 'band-aid' to address liquidity: Economists,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/need-to-go-beyond-band-aid-to-address-liquidity-economists/articleshow/116114592.cms,09-12-2024,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) will have to infuse more liquidity into the banking system through additional measures as the expected impact of the 50-basis-point
cash reserve ratio
(CRR) cut announced Friday will likely wane within a few months, economists said.
The central bank will likely use other liquidity instruments, like open market operations (purchases), foreign exchange swaps, and long-term variable rate repo auctions (VRR), they said.
The RBI in its policy statement on Friday said that it will continue to be 'nimble and proactive' in its liquidity management operations to ensure that money market interest rates evolve in an orderly manner. Speaking to the media soon after announcing the policy, Governor Shaktikanta Das declined to give more details on the likely liquidity operations by the RBI.
""I will not be able to spell out what actions we have on the table, it will all depend on how the liquidity situation evolves,"" Das had said.
System liquidity is expected to be under pressure by March because banks would likely deploy this additional liquidity - caused by the
CRR cut
- to repay some of their non-deposit liabilities. Banks' liabilities to the rest of the banking system doubled to ₹5 lakh crore on October 23, to ₹2.5 lakh crore in 2019, according to
Piramal Enterprises

""The CRR cut only serves as a band-aid to ease money markets as liquidity tightens from December 2024 to March 2025. This announcement will potentially release ₹90,000 crore in December and ₹1.16 lakh crore by March 2025. The effect is expected to fizzle out beyond that,"" said Debopam Chaudhuri, chief economist at Piramal Enterprises.
The average system liquidity in October was at ₹1.47 lakh crore, reaching a two-year high of ₹2.88 lakh crore. In November, the average liquidity was ₹1.34 lakh crore, RBI data showed.
A stronger dollar environment will also put pressure on system liquidity, as the RBI intervenes in the currency market to curb excess volatility in the rupee. The Indian rupee has depreciated to fresh lows of 84.74/$1 recently, as the Reserve Bank likely intervened in the foreign exchange market to prevent excess volatility in the rupee. The RBI has net sold $46 billion of its foreign reserves since October.
""The rupee may weaken more against the dollar than we have seen in the recent past. Constant inflation worries and a strong dollar environment will be the flavour of the year to come and may limit
repo rate
cuts to two (February and April). In this environment, liquidity instruments are likely to dominate, like the CRR, which was used on Friday,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
The RBI on Friday delivered a 50 basis-point CRR cut to infuse liquidity in the system amid tight conditions. This becomes effective in two tranches - December 14 and December 28 - and offsets tight liquidity conditions caused by advance tax and GST outflows.
""One feels going ahead, it might be important for RBI to continue monitoring banking system liquidity conditions closely and continue to provide support for durable liquidity in order to support growth in credit to the productive sectors of the economy,"" said Siddhartha Sanyal, chief economist at
Bandhan Bank

Cash still has demand in times of digital push,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cash-still-has-demand-in-times-of-digital-push/articleshow/116111250.cms,08-12-2024,"Even as digital payments touch fresh peaks every month,
cash
still continues to have loyal users. Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) data on currency in circulation shows that it has been a roller coaster ride for
cash demand
this year.
It rose sharply during elections and festivals and fell at the same pace subsequently.
An ET analysis shows that cash demand went up by Rs 87,000 crore from the date the Lok Sabha elections were announced in mid-March until the last phase of the election in the first week of June. Then, they fell by Rs 84,000 crore until end September.
Again, it climbed Rs 85,000 crore until early November ( November 8), coinciding with the major festival periods of Navratri and Diwali. It was also the period prior to the state assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.
Currency in circulation (CIC) contracted Rs 20,000 crore in the subsequent three weeks. Significantly, it fell Rs 10,000 crore in just one week after the assembly election in the week ending November 29 .

Odisha govt suffered loss of Rs 75 crore excise revenue during COVID pandemic: CAG,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/odisha-govt-suffered-loss-of-rs-75-crore-excise-revenue-during-covid-pandemic-cag/articleshow/116102391.cms,08-12-2024,"The
Comptroller and Auditor General
(CAG) unearthed a loss of excise revenue amounting to Rs 75.07 crore due to manipulation of manually maintained sales registers by retail shops of alcoholic beverages in Odisha during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In its report, which was placed in the assembly on Saturday, the CAG said that the
Odisha Excise Department
in May 2020 imposed the Special COVID Fee (SCF), at the rate of 50 per cent of the maximum retail price, on all foreign made foreign liquor, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), beer, wine and ready to drink beverages, sold in the state.
SCF was imposed in view of the expected loss of excise revenue, on account of the two months' shutdown, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
SCF was applicable on the alcoholic beverages, to be traded with effect from March 24, 2020, including the unsold stock lying with the retailers. To enforce this provision, excise field officials were instructed to verify the stock of the liquor shops, it said.
To examine the process of levy of SCF, the CAG intended to scrutinise 1,378 sales registers of 1,378 retail liquor shops functioning under 21 district excise offices. Out of these, 108 (7.84 percent) were not furnished to the audit.

The price of the liquor products depend on the brand and size (in ml) of the bottle. However, brand-wise and size-wise sale registers had not been maintained by the retail shops. The excise officers-in-charge of the retail shops had not enforced maintenance of such data.
Hence, without maintaining the brand-wise and size-wise registers, it was not possible to levy the exact amount of SCF applicable to each retailer, based on the closing stock, as on March 24, 2020, the audit pointed out.
The closing balances, from the manually maintained sale registers, as on March 24, 2020 had not been collected, prior to the reopening of the retail outlets. Thus, the sales registers, had not been thoroughly examined and verified by the excise OIC, prior to levy of SCF.
The CAG estimated that 1,27,21,915 liquor bottles (whiskey, rum, vodka, brandy and beer) had been reported as having been sold in excess of the normal sales trends, by 716 licensed retailers, prior to the levy of SCF.
""Due to this irregular reporting of excess sales, through manipulation of the sales registers, there had been an estimated loss of Rs 75.07 crore, towards levy and collection of SCF,"" it said.
The audit was hinted at the possibility of collusion between the licensed retailers and the excise in-charge officers concerned.
It is of the view that the acts of omission and commission, which resulted in loss of government revenue, were sufficiently egregious, as to warrant initiation of disciplinary action against the excise officers concerned.
While accepting the above observations of the CAG, the Excise Commissioner (in April 2023) said non-furnishing of sales registers to audit was a serious matter and the superintendents of excise concerned had been instructed to issue show cause not only to the licensees but also to the excise officers concerned for such non-submission.
The commissioner had also ensured that follow up action would be taken against the licensees and erring officers following due process and all possible steps would be taken for realisation of government revenue, the report said.

Key investment destination: FDI inflows in India cross $1 trillion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/key-investment-destination-fdi-inflows-in-india-cross-1-trillion/articleshow/116099455.cms,08-12-2024,"Foreign direct investment
(FDI) inflows into India have crossed the USD one trillion milestone in the April 2000-September 2024 period, firmly establishing the country's reputation as a safe and key investment destination globally. According to data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the cumulative amount of
FDI
, including equity, reinvested earnings and other capital, stood at USD 1,033.40 billion during the said period.
About 25 per cent of the FDI came through the Mauritius route. It was followed by Singapore (24 per cent), the US (10 per cent), the Netherlands (7 per cent), Japan (6 per cent), the UK (5 per cent), UAE (3 per cent) and Cayman Islands, Germany and Cyprus accounted for 2 per cent each.
India received USD 177.18 billion from Mauritius, USD 167.47 billion from Singapore and USD 67.8 billion from the US during the period under review, as per the data.
The key sectors attracting the maximum of these inflows include the services segment, computer software and hardware, telecommunications, trading, construction development, automobile, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.
According to the Commerce and Industry Ministry, since 2014, India has attracted a cumulative FDI inflow of USD 667.4 billion (2014-24), registering an increase of 119 per cent over the preceding decade (2004-14).

""This investment inflow spans 31 states and 57 sectors, driving growth across diverse industries. Most sectors, except strategically important sectors, are open for 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.
FDI equity inflows into the manufacturing sector over the past decade (2014-24) reached USD 165.1 billion, marking a 69 per cent increase over the previous decade (2004 -14), which saw inflows of USD 97.7 billion, an official has said.
To ensure that India remains an attractive and investor-friendly destination, the government reviews FDI policy on an ongoing basis and makes changes from time to time after having extensive consultations with stakeholders.
The overseas inflows into India are likely to gather momentum in 2025, as healthy macroeconomic numbers, better industrial output and attractive PLI schemes will attract more overseas players amid geopolitical headwinds, experts said.
They added that despite the global challenges, India is still the preferred investment destination.
Avimukt Dar, Founding Partner, INDUSLAW, said the inflows are likely to continue in a robust form. There is strong anticipation that private equity financing in the tech sector, which had slowed down in the past, will pick up again since various funds have enjoyed good exits in the public markets and are ready to deploy again.
""The government can continue with structural reforms, particularly in the space of M&A, by nudging SEBI to make the public takeover regime more friendly for foreign players,"" Dar said.
Rumki Majumdar, an economist at consultancy Deloitte India, said FDI inflows are likely to remain modest amidst expected policy changes in the US and the impact of policy stimulus on China's economy.
Geopolitical situations may alter supply chains, and trade regulations would dampen investors' sentiments, keeping capital flows volatile, she said, adding that the government will have to prioritise infrastructure capex with timely project execution, boost workforce skilling via PPPs and incentives, invest in digital ecosystems for productivity gains, and foster R&D for digital solutions that help inclusion and formalisation of the economy.
Commenting on the data, Manav Nagaraj, Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said FDI in India is likely to continue to rise in all areas -- early stage investments, growth capital and strategic investments.
""India as an investment destination has historically been and continues to be attractive for foreign investors across various countries, whether from the US, UK, continental Europe or Asian countries,"" he added.
FDI is allowed through the automatic route in most of the sectors, while in areas like telecom, media, pharmaceuticals and insurance, government approval is required for foreign investors.
Under the government approval route, a foreign investor has to get a prior nod from the ministry or department concerned, whereas, under the automatic route, an overseas investor is only required to inform the Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) after the investment is made.
At present, FDI is prohibited in some sectors. They are lottery, gambling and betting, chit funds, Nidhi company, real estate business, and manufacturing of cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes using tobacco.
FDI is important for India as it will require huge investments in the coming years for the infrastructure sector to boost growth. Healthy foreign inflows also help in maintaining the balance of payments and the value of the rupee.

Tough to mop up taxman's outstanding demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/tough-to-mop-up-taxmans-outstanding-demand/articleshow/116084378.cms,07-12-2024,"The
outstanding tax demand
of the
income-tax department
has grown more than fourfold to ₹42 lakh crore as on October 1 this year, from ₹10 lakh crore in 2019-20, according to a report of the parliamentary standing committee on finance. Of this amount, ₹27 lakh crore is flagged as difficult to recover by the department.
The dues sought by the department include ₹5.42 lakh crore where the assessees are not traceable, ₹8.60 lakh crore where there are not adequate assets attached for recovery and more than ₹2 lakh crore stuck in companies facing insolvency proceedings or liquidations, the report, tabled in Parliament, highlighted.
In case of the
Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs
(CBIC), the arrears have risen to more than ₹4.26 lakh crore in 2023-24 from over ₹3.02 lakh crore in FY22.
The committee expressed concern that in about 85% of indirect taxes and nearly 65% in direct taxes, the outstanding amounts were difficult to collect.
While the income tax department has made an action plan to recover the outstanding tax demand of ₹15 lakh crore, which is collectible, the committee has asked the CBIC to make a proper plan to recover the outstanding indirect tax.

Free cash everywhere! States' election win pitch with Maha freebies comes with big budget burden,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/free-cash-everywhere-states-election-win-pitch-with-maha-freebies-comes-with-big-budget-burden/articleshow/116066629.cms,07-12-2024,"The
Delhi government
’s ambitious plan to provide ₹1,000 per month to women over 18 years of age under the
Mukhya Mantri Mahila Samman Yojana
(MMMSY) is projected to cost ₹4,560 crore annually, according to the finance department. With the city’s subsidy bill nearing ₹11,000 crore, officials have raised concerns that implementing the scheme from FY 2025-26 could result in a budgetary deficit.
A draft proposal for the scheme, submitted by the Women and Child Development Department, estimates that approximately 38 lakh women in Delhi would qualify for financial assistance. However, the finance department has cautioned that a revenue deficit could lead to central government intervention, potentially limiting Delhi’s financial autonomy.
Fiscal challenges amid rising expenditure
Delhi’s finance department highlighted that the city’s government, unlike other states, cannot raise market loans and must rely on the costlier National Small Saving Fund for borrowing. The additional expenditure from MMMSY and other commitments, such as a ₹2,500 crore grant to the Delhi Jal Board, could increase revenue liability by ₹7,000 crore in FY 2025-26.
The department’s communication to Chief Minister Atishi noted that anticipated revenue growth would likely fall short of covering incremental liabilities and normal expenditure increases. “There is a serious possibility of significant revenue and budget deficits and cash imbalances,” it warned.
Live Events
CM Stresses Implementation Feasibility
In response, Chief Minister Atishi has said that it is premature to conclude whether MMMSY can be implemented within the current fiscal year. The 2024-25 budget allocated ₹2,000 crore for the scheme, and Atishi emphasized that implementation timelines could vary. “It is too early to decide whether MMMSY shall be implemented in FY 2024-25 or not,” she stated.
Sources in the administration told TOI that the current year’s allocation might suffice, given higher-than-expected revenue collections. “Revised estimates passed in the assembly are ₹1,700 crore higher than the budget estimate,” a source said, dismissing concerns about a revenue deficit.
Political implications of cash handouts
Cash handouts to women voters played a significant role in the recently concluded Maharashtra state assembly elections, reflecting a growing trend in Indian politics. Ahead of the elections, the BJP-led coalition announced a ₹1,500 monthly financial assistance program for 2.5 crore women. This initiative was included in the state budget to boost voter support, particularly in rural and economically disadvantaged areas.
The strategy appeared to have paid dividends. The BJP and its allies secured a commanding victory, overturning losses from the April-May parliamentary elections, where opposition parties had made significant inroads. Analysts believe the

program not only addressed immediate financial needs of underprivileged women but also served as a targeted political tool to bridge the electoral gap.
Observers note that such schemes highlight India’s socio-economic inequalities and underscore the political value of targeting underprivileged groups with financial assistance. However, they also raise questions about the long-term fiscal impact of such measures on state budgets.

RBI adds 27 tn gold to country's reserve in October: WGC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-adds-27-tn-gold-to-countrys-reserve-in-october-wgc/articleshow/116015035.cms,05-12-2024,"Gold buying by central banks surged to 60 tonnes in October, mainly led by the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) which added 27 tonnes of the precious metal to its reserves, the World Gold Council (WGC) said on Thursday. India added 27 tonnes of gold in October, bringing its total gold purchases to 77 tonnes from January to October, according WGC data based on reported monthly data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
This buying by RBI represents a five-fold increase as compared to the same period of 2023, said WGC.
According to the data, with this purchase the total gold reserve of India is now at 882 tonnes, of which 510 tonnes are held in India.
WGC further stated that emerging market central banks continued to dominate the market with Turkey and Poland adding 72 tonnes and 69 tonnes from January-October 2024, to their gold reserves, respectively.
These three central banks alone accounted for 60 per cent of total global net purchases reported this year, it added.

October's figures have surpassed the quarterly total of April-June and July-September quarters, it said.
Further, it revealed that the National Bank of Poland recorded net buying of 8 tonnes during October, its seventh consecutive month of net buying.
The NBP's annual report highlights its commitment to accumulating gold, with the central bank targeting a 20 per cent allocation as a percentage of its total official reserve assets, it added.
The data further highlighted that the National Bank of Kazakhstan added 5 tonnes of gold to its reserves after five months of net selling, however, the country remains a net seller.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) added 2 tonnes of gold, making October its 20th consecutive month of net buying, it said adding that CNB has accumulated 37 tonnes of gold over the period increasing its total gold reserves to 49 tonnes.

Govt open to idea of alternate financing model for MSME: Piyush Goyal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/govt-open-to-idea-of-alternate-financing-model-for-msme-piyush-goyal/articleshow/116006915.cms,05-12-2024,"New Delhi: The government is open to the idea of alternate financing model to support micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) and that particular areas can be earmarked for them in the proposed industrial townships, commerce and industry minister
Piyush Goyal
said Thursday.
Urging the industry to share specific issues they are facing in accessing bank credit, Goyal said: “If we get that more specific feedback then we will be able to take it up with the bankers. ECGC is looking at factor services also but my own personal view is that being costlier, people will still prefer to go to the bank and take a loan but we are open to the idea of alternate financing models”.
He also added that MSMEs can be provided land at concessional rates to develop their businesses in the townships.
“Give me specific details (as in) what kinds of problems they (MSMEs) face. Is too much collateral being asked? Suppose an ECGC (Export Credit Guarantee Corporation) cover is available, do they (banks) still ask for collateral, what kind of interest they charge when a 90% guarantee is taken by ECGC in the event of any failure of export credit?,” the minister said at an Assocham event.
His statement assumes significance in the wake of exporters raising concerns over declining bank credit.
Live Events
Goyal also said that India should aim for one startup per 1,000 people as is the case in Israel as against one startup per 10,000 people in India at present.
On setting aside areas for MSMEs in industrial townships, he said: “I am happy to commit to a particular area earmarked for MSMEs because without MSMEs no large industries will survive. If Toyota is investing Rs 20,000 crore in one of our industrial cities at Shendra-Bidkin at Sambhaji Nagar (Maharashtra), clearly they will need 100s of MSMEs in their support ecosystem.”
In August, the cabinet approved 12 new project proposals under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme with an estimated investment of Rs 28,602 crore to set up industrial parks/townships in the country.
Single window, Boiler’s Bill
On the Boiler’s Bill which was passed by the Rajya Sabha Wednesday, he said: “Even in the boilers bill. What was the effort? And it's not as if I claim that everything has been done only by our government. It's been a continuing effort”.
Further, he expressed “pain” that the industry is not giving feedback on the ministry's single window system Initiative.
“I've invested huge amount of money, huge amount of personal time to create that single window… (if) you don’t use it, and when you don’t use it, I don’t get any feedback whether it is worth its effort or not,” he said.

"Delayed spending by states may help govt save Rs 30,000 cr this FY",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/delayed-spending-by-states-may-help-govt-save-rs-30000-cr-this-fy/articleshow/115946162.cms,04-12-2024,"New Delhi: Delayed spending by states and tighter monitoring of usage of funds under
centrally sponsored schemes
(CSS) could save the Centre about ₹30,000 crore in the overall allocation of ₹5.05 lakh crore for such programmes in the current fiscal year, according to an official.
The Centre is expected to use the savings under CSS to increase spending under other heads.
""We expect the CSS expenditure to be lower than the BE (budget estimates) by ₹28,000 crore to ₹30,000 crore in the current fiscal year,"" a senior official told ET.
Officials said about ₹17,000 crore may be saved on account of slow progress on spending in some of the flagship schemes due to the Lok Sabha and state elections this year. The Centre is likely to save another ₹13,000 crore by plugging loopholes in various schemes.

The Centre had allocated ₹5.05 lakh crore for CSS in the budget for 2024-25, 9.8% higher than the target in the revised estimates in key flagship centrally sponsored schemes such as Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). This is almost half of the total capital expenditure for the current fiscal year. Currently, CSSs accounts for 10.4% of the Centre's expenditure budget of ₹48.2 lakh crore for the year.
The official said changes to allocation would be firmed up closer to the budget. ""The Centre is nudging states to expedite spending but allocations may still remain unspent,"" the official said.
The government is already in the process of further rationalising the CSS, including share of funding between the Centre and the states.
In March 2015,
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
had constituted a sub-group of chief ministers on rationalisation of CSS. The Centre has almost halved the number of centrally sponsored schemes to 75 from 130 in 2015.
Officials said that some of the ministries are already doing their internal evaluation and may include the recommendation in their demand for funds for the budget for FY25. ""The target is to limit the number of CSS to 50 and ministries are carrying out assessment on parameters such as funds released, fund utilised, impact and future relevance, among others,"" the official said.
Separately, the government think tank Niti Aayog is working on further
rationalisation of schemes
for agriculture, health, skill development, urban development, water resources and environment.

The central board of trustees is the highest decision making body of the EPFO. It is chaired by the labour and employment minister and comprises representatives of the employees, employers and the government.
The 236th meeting of the board approved over a half a dozen other proposals including simplification of the criteria for empanelment of banks, both agency and scheduled commercial banks, for centralised collection of EPF contributions. “This initiative will enhance both the ease of doing business and the ease of providing service,” it said.
Besides, the board approved the proposal to pay interest to EPFO subscribers till the claim settlement date unlike the existing provisions under which the claim settled till 24th of the month was entitled to interest up to the end of the preceding month.
“Now, the interest will be paid to the member up to the date of settlement. This will result in financial benefit to the members and reduce the grievances,” it said, adding after this decision, these claims will be processed for the entire month leading to reduced pendency, timely settlement and optimized utilization of resources.

Share ESOP tale: Taxman to remind MNC staff,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/share-esop-tale-taxman-to-remind-mnc-staff/articleshow/115817909.cms,30-11-2024,"Mumbai: The Indian tax office will alert multinational corporations to forewarn employees about the pitfalls of not disclosing their stock options.
I-T department
has drawn up a list of 42 foreign companies whose arms and subsidiaries employ over 1.2 lakh employees, many of whom are covered under employee stock option (ESOP) or employee stock purchase plans (ESPP).
Tax officials, according to an internal presentation of the department, would contact the HR and payroll cells of these MNCs to inform them about the employees whose names have figured in the lists shared by other countries of Indian residents owning assets abroad. The tax office is inundated with such data from other jurisdictions having 'automatic exchange of information' pacts with India.
Non-disclosure of security holdings post exercise of ESOPs, probably often unwittingly, could attract stiff penalty under the Black Money law while using the proceeds later to buy offshore properties or other assets could further complicate matters for taxpayers if the newly acquired assets are not declared in the I-T returns (ITRs).
ET Bureau
Since 2012, taxpayers have to disclose their foreign assets -such as offshore bank accounts, properties, beneficial ownerships and trusteeship of foreign trusts, and properties- under the FA schedule of the ITR forms.

The present move by the department is part of the drive to tax undeclared overseas assets, with the number of resident Indians having foreign assets having tripled to 1.9 lakh last in 2023-24 from 60,000 in 2020-21.
""There is a myth amongst salaried employees that since their TDS on salary is deducted at source, there is no further tax obligation on them to make any disclosure in respect of assets including foreign assets,"" said Siddharth Banwat, partner at the CA firm S Banwat & Associates LLP.
""In fact, there are many startup founders who had initially set up ventures in the US while they were abroad and later returned to India but continued to hold equity which is allotted while they were non-residents. Here, the vesting of shares (or the acquisition of full rights) happens as the startup progresses. In such cases, there are lapses in reporting foreign assets including social security accounts. These are genuine mistakes and steps taken by the
tax department
to create awareness are welcome,"" said Banwat.
The present move by the department is part of the drive to tax undeclared overseas assets, with the number of resident Indians having foreign assets having tripled to 1.9 lakh last in 2023-24 from 60,000 in 2020-21.
According to Harshal Bhuta of the CA firm P. R. Bhuta & Co, “It is not unusual to encounter instances of non-disclosure of foreign assets and/or income among certain classes of taxpayers, such as erstwhile NRIs, foreign expatriates working in India, and employees receiving foreign ESOPs, often due to a lack of awareness. However, taxpayers have the opportunity to rectify such omissions by filing a revised return for FY 2023-24 before 31st December 2024, allowing them to report their foreign assets and income.”
“If this opportunity is missed, residents may still benefit from the foreign asset non-disclosure penalty exemption having a threshold limit of Rs 20 lakhs, effective from October 1, 2024, for foreign assets other than immovable property. Additionally, based on Supreme Court rulings, one may also be able to claim this limit to be retrospective,” said Bhuta.
Some of the large international banks and technology biggies are part of the MNCs shortlisted by the department. The department may get in touch with a few large Indian software companies, probably to sensitise the employees --- many of whom could join MNCs later --- of the significance of FA declarations.
Practitioners say that there is a lack of awareness even for local asset disclosure. “In many cases (where no foreign assets are involved) individuals do not make appropriate asset and liability disclosure which they have to do when total annual income exceeds Rs 50 lakh,” said Banwat.

While the pandemic flared up in India in 2020-21, it did impact economic output towards the end of 2019-20, especially in the wake of a lockdown in late March in 2020, although the slowdown had set in before the Covid onslaught.
While states’ own revenue mop-up has exceeded the 2018-19 level since 2022-23, lower central transfers have kept their overall revenue collections from rising in tandem, thanks to the discontinuation of GST compensation grants and lower devolution, it said.
Their own revenue collection is budgeted to touch 8.3% in 2024-25, against 7.7% in the last fiscal and 7.5% in 2018-19.
Live Events
States’ combined
fiscal deficit
has started inching up again from last fiscal when it rose to 3% of GSDP from 2.7% in the previous year, partly as interest burden for elevated borrowing during Covid started to impact.
For the current financial year, states have budgeted an even higher fiscal deficit of 3.2% of GSDP.
SGST revenue beats 2018-19 level
The collection of
state goods and services tax
(SGST) touched 2.9% of GSDP last fiscal, exceeding the 2018-19 level of 2.7%. The SGST mop-up made up a significant 40% of states’ own revenue last fiscal, although there were sharp
inter-state variations
.
The report said the share of revenue from integrated GST (IGST) remained higher for states with lower manufacturing and mining, ostensibly because it’s a consumption tax.
Meanwhile, states’ revenue from integrated GST (IGST) made up around 46% of the total SGST revenue. However, for states with a lower share of manufacturing and mining, the share of IGST was higher, thanks to greater consumer base in those states.
Pension switch to inflate states’ burden
The report said switching to the new
Unified Pension Scheme
(UPS) could involve additional expenditure for states. States’ pension expenditure is estimated at 1.6% of GDP this fiscal.
Between 1980 and 2002, pension expenditure of states grew at a higher rate than their revenue, which had prompted pension reforms about two decades ago. Most state governments also transitioned to a defined contribution plan over subsequent years.
However, over the last two years, states such as Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Punjab, have decided to re-adopt the old pension scheme.
Subsequently, the Centre approved in August the UPS to provide assured pension for central government employees. Under this, the contribution of the central government will rise from 14% of basic pay and dearness allowance of the employee to 18.5%. Maharashtra has decided to implement the UPS for its employees and some others are also assessing the impact of such a shift.
Shifting to the UPS from the current pension scheme “may involve higher expenditure for states due to increased employer contribution”. “If the corpus built during employment is insufficient to meet the assured pension, state governments may also have to allocate funds from the annual budgets to cover the gap,” it added.

Income Tax probe finds 500 'actionable' cases of undisclosed Dubai assets held by Indians,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/i-t-probe-finds-500-actionable-cases-of-undisclosed-dubai-assets-held-by-indians/articleshow/115779979.cms,29-11-2024,"Mumbai: The income-tax department has found more than 500 ""actionable"" cases related to undisclosed immovable properties held by Indians in Dubai and raids conducted in Delhi alone have discovered evidence of
unaccounted transactions
worth more than ₹700 crore, people in the know told ET.
The Delhi investigation wing of the department has carried out more than a dozen searches and found evidence about 43 undisclosed immovable properties in Dubai, said a tax official. ""The figure of the suspected evasion just in Delhi is over ₹700 crore. Since the investigation is pan India, this amount is only going to go up. We suspect this to run into a few thousand crores,"" added the official.
Recently, Germany shared with India information about properties owned by Indians in the Middle East under the '
Spontaneous Exchange of Information
' mechanism of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between the two countries. The information included details of properties owned by more than a thousand Indians.
It is not immediately clear how such information landed up in the hands of German authorities.
Taxpayers have admitted undisclosed cash investment of more than ₹125 crore during the Delhi searches, said the official cited earlier.
Live Events
During the searches, the department found bogus receipts of bogus cash payments, receipts and purchases, the people said. ""These are being studied to understand the modus operandi of parking unaccounted capital outside the country - extent of the non-disclosure of assets abroad and the scope or potential of black money,"" said another official, adding that they are looking at applying the Income Tax Act or Black Money Act in these cases.
Since the end of October, a flurry of notices has been issued based on this information that the government shared with the Director General of Income Tax - Investigation.
The department has asked its investigation wing to conduct 360-degree profiling of the taxpayers under scrutiny, along with determining the residency and cross-mapping of foreign assets already declared, people in the know said.

"RBI injects ₹6,956 crore as liquidity turns to deficit",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-injects-6956-crore-as-liquidity-turns-to-deficit/articleshow/115706959.cms,26-11-2024,"Mumbai: After running surplus
liquidity
of about ₹1.4 lakh crore for over two months, the
banking
system saw a decline in cash, prompting the
Reserve Bank
of India to inject ₹6,956 crore on Monday.
The liquidity deficit was because of the balance of payments turning negative in the ongoing quarter at $23 billion, due to persistent outflows from foreign portfolio investors (FPI) and the RBI selling dollars in the market to support the rupee, economists said.
This also led to the weighted average call rate (WACR) moving 22 basis points higher than the policy repo rate at 6.72% on Monday, pushing up borrowing costs for banks. A higher WACR correspondingly pushes up borrowing costs also for companies raising funds through other debt instruments, such as certificates of deposits and commercial papers.
""This deficit of system liquidity is because balance of payments (BoP) turned negative in Q3FY25, plus a widening trade deficit and rise in FPI outflows since October 2024 resulted in RBI selling dollars (and buying the rupee),"" said Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist at IDFC First bank. ""This is also reflected in core liquidity, which has reduced from peak levels. Reduction in core liquidity indicates that system liquidity tightness could persist if BoP outflows persist,"" she said.
Core liquidity - system liquidity plus government surplus - reduced from peak surplus of ₹4.6 trillion on September 27 to ₹1.6 trillion on November 15. India's foreign exchange reserves fell by $17.8 billion in the week ended November 15, to reach a four-month low of $657.9 billion, RBI data showed.

RBI
) injected funds into the
banking system
as the weighted average call rate, a barometer for short-term borrowing costs, rose 23 basis points above the policy
repo rate
at 6.73% on Friday.
Surplus liquidity in the banking system shrank to ₹84,154.75 crore due to monthly GST outflows. This is akin to a fine-tuning exercise to manage call rates near the repo rate, as monthly tax outflows drew surplus liquidity out of the banking system,
money market
experts said.
The RBI injected funds worth ₹25,000 crore via a
variable rate repo auction
(VRR) to ensure that recent overseas outflows from local debt and equity do not drive up banks' cost of funds, analysts said. This is the second such auction that the RBI has conducted post its change in stance to neutral from withdrawal of accommodation.
On Thursday, surplus liquidity - as measured by absorption of funds by the RBI - dropped to a one-month low of ₹84,154.75 crore, central bank data showed.
""The RBI has been very flexible and quick to manage liquidity. I am also expecting some VRR auctions to happen around mid December when there are advance tax outflows,"" said Vikas Goel, MD and CEO at
PNB Gilts
. ""The RBI wants to keep durable liquidity positive and roughly about 1% to 1.2% of NDTL, to make sure that the call rates don't move away from the repo rate,"" he said.

In the auction on Friday, the RBI received bids worth ₹35,420 crore from banks versus the notified amount of ₹25,000 crore, reflecting the need for funds from lenders.
So far in November, the rupee has weakened nearly 0.5% to 84.45/$1 and foreign investors have sold $4 billion from Indian stocks and bonds, depository data showed. Likely intervention by the RBI has capped the rupee from depreciating further, currency dealers said.

The rupee appreciated 0.1% in September boosted by strong risk appetite following the US Federal Reserve's outsized 50 bps rate cut.
However, the currency's upside was limited due absorption of dollar inflows by the Reserve Bank of India.
The currency moved in a tight range in September from 83.8/$1 to 83.7/$1, as the RBI absorbed dollar inflows.
The RBIs
foreign exchange reserves
also reached a record high of $704.89 billion on September 27.
Live Events
The stated position of the RBI is that it intervenes in the currency exchange market to cap excess volatility and does not target particular levels.
The routine intervention by the RBI has caused overvaluation of the rupee compared currencies of its 40 trading partners.
The rupee’s real effective exchange rate (REER) shows that the local currency was overvalued by 7.21% as of October 31, close to its highest level in nearly six years, RBI data showed.
REER is a measure of the currency’s competitiveness as against the 40 currencies.
Overvaluation of India's currency adversely impacts the country’s exports by making them more expensive.
But ""the sensitivity of India's merchandise exports to real exchange rate changes seems to have come down over the years,"" the RBI said in its monthly bulletin.
India's merchandise exports grew by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% since April 2018, faster than the world's average of 4%, the bulletin said.

not to seek protective cover of weak currency as it is not a substitute for productivity and investment in research and development. A weak currency can be good for exporters, making their products relatively less expensive for buyers abroad.

Nageswaran further said the reliance on weak currency should not be the answer, if anything it should be part of the policy arsenal to be deployed contextually, but not as a substitute for productivity, investment in R&D and quality, but as a complement at best.
""We should not be thinking about in terms of the transformation of competitiveness, which is to continuously expect the weak currency to bail us,"" he said at an event organised by the Institute for Studies in Industrial Development (ISID).
Noting that China relied on weaker currency but it was guided by domestic productivity leaps in the first decade and also in the last decade of the new millennium.

""In many other developing countries, including India, weak

actually has become a protective cover for lack of productivity.
""It was used to hide our inefficiencies. That should not be the case,"" Nageswaran said.

""But, we usually in the past has tended to shield, take cover behind the weaker exchange rate,"" the CEA said, adding that it should not continue.
Nageswaran said many countries now focusing on exchange rates as a tool of industrial policy, so there will be reactions and counter-reactions.
Observing that the world has already entered the era of de-globalisation, he said, ""The reliance on global GDP growth and global export growth, driving our export growth... is not going to happen"".
So, it is important for corporates to invest in human capital, the CEA emphasised.
While noting that the annual average economic growth of India between 2013-14 to 2023-24 was 5.9 per cent, he said, ""Industrial transition is necessary for us to get back to high growth rate"".
Pointing out that no country has achieved industrial growth without a cheap energy supply, Nageswaran said the energy transition will be incomplete without cross-subsidisation that prevails in various sectors.

, which would allow for prompt credit of taxpayers’ refunds on order issuance, enabling adjustments against outstanding demands or future income tax liabilities.
“The government’s progress in digitalisation is already reshaping the tax landscape, enhancing the ease of doing business and driving efficiencies that taxpayers highly appreciate,” said Rohinton Sidhwa, Partner at Deloitte India.
""The
2024 Budget
’s focus on ‘Viksit Bharat’, with a strong emphasis on innovation and R&D (research and development), seeks to continue the transformative change in tax administration,"" he added.
The report titled ‘Income
Tax Digitalisation
in India 2.0’ covered over 250 industry professionals from industries, such as technology, financial services, consumers, government and public services.

One of the priorities of taxpayers was to streamline TDS/TCS compliance, with 70% of respondents calling for a reduction in the number of sections and/or achieving uniformity in rates, the report highlighted.
It also further noted that around 92% of organisations have either transitioned or plan to implement a technology-driven tax function in the next five years. Moreover, 77% of companies have increased their budgets for
tax transformation and automation
in 2023-24, up from 67% the previous year.
However, challenges remain towards tax digitalisation, such as shortage of skilled tax technology professionals, resistance to adopting new technologies and difficulties in integrating existing systems with external solutions or government portals, the report mentioned.

Non-financial CPSE dividend target may be retained in FY25 revised estimate,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/non-financial-cpse-dividend-target-may-be-retained-in-fy25-revised-estimate/articleshow/115427676.cms,19-11-2024,"The government will likely maintain its 2024-25 budgeted target for dividends from non-financial central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and entities in which it holds minority stakes at Rs 56,260 crore in the revised estimate, a person aware of the development said.
The dividends have touched Rs 30,226 crore in just over seven-and-a-half months of the current fiscal and constitutes 54% of the full-year target, showed the latest data by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). But a bulk of the mop-up is expected in the crucial March quarter, pushing up the dividends to the targeted level, he said.
“If the global oil prices remain stable around $75 barrel, domestic oil companies will continue to make good profits and boost the dividend kitty. Power companies are also expected to do well,” said the person.
Global Brent crude oil prices have remained in the range of $71 and $76 a barrel over the past month, having eased from $85 in early July.
DIPAM’s dividend collections had scaled a new peak of Rs 63,749 crore in 2023-24, beating the revised estimate (Rs 50,000 crore) for a third straight year and partly offsetting the shortfall in the disinvestment revenue.

This year, however, the dividend collections may not exceed the initial estimate by a wide margin, although they will still remain strong, said another person.
CPSEs in the petroleum and natural gas sector led the pack of entities with dividends of Rs 9,666 crore to the government, followed by those in power (Rs 4,416 crore), mines (Rs 3,832), communications (Rs 3,443 crore) and coal (Rs 2,096 crore), the
DIPAM data
showed.
Divestment proceeds
Meanwhile, disinvestment revenue, however, remained low at Rs 8,625 crore so far this fiscal, garnered mainly through the government dilution of a part of its stakes through offers for sale (OFS). The OFS of
Hindustan Zinc
fetched Rs 3,449 crore, General Insurance Corporation Rs 2,346 crore and
Cochin Shipyard
Rs 2,015 crore. Another Rs 815 crore came as the remittance from the Specified Undertaking of The Unit Trust of India.
From the current fiscal, the government has stopped declaring a separate disinvestment target. Instead, it announced a combined divestment and asset monetisation goal of Rs 50,000 crore for 2024-25.
The government is in the process of conducting the strategic sale of
IDBI Bank
, which, if realised this fiscal, will substantially lift the disinvestment revenue.
Analysts have, however, said a shortfall on account of disinvestments and taxes could be offset by a potential drop in the government’s capital spending from the targeted Rs 11.11 lakh crore and the Reserve Bank of India’s record dividend of Rs 2.11 lakh crore. This will enable the government to meet its fiscal deficit target of 4.9% of gross domestic product in 2024-25, against 5.6% in the previous year.

Govt to exceed FY25 direct tax collection target: CBDT chief,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/govt-to-exceed-fy25-direct-tax-collection-target-cbdt-chief/articleshow/115411558.cms,18-11-2024,"The government will exceed the Rs 22.07 lakh crore
direct tax collection target
set for the current fiscal,
Central Board of Direct Taxes
(
CBDT
) chairman
Ravi Agarwal
said on Monday.
Agarwal also said that taxpayers who have not disclosed their foreign income or assets in their ITRs have time till December 31 to file their revised return for the 2023-24 fiscal. The tax department is in the process of sending SMS and emails to those assessees who have not disclosed high-value assets.
Inaugurating the Taxpayers Lounge at the
India International Trade Fair
(IITF), Agarwal also said that more than 6,000 suggestions have come in for a review of the income tax law to make the language simple and easy to understand.
""We are hopeful and we believe that we will exceed the budget target for tax collection. Collections from corporate and
non-corporate taxes
have risen,"" Agarwal told reporters here.
As per the latest data released by the CBDT, between April 1 and November 10, net direct tax collection has grown 15.41 per cent to Rs 12.11 lakh crore.
Live Events
This includes net corporate tax of Rs 5.10 lakh crore and non-corporate taxes (including taxes paid by individuals, HUFs, firms) of Rs 6.62 lakh crore.
Securities transaction tax (STT) worth Rs 35,923 crore was mopped up during the period.
The government has set a target to collect Rs 22.07 lakh crore from direct taxes during the current fiscal.
This includes Rs 10.20 lakh crore from corporate tax and Rs 11.87 lakh crore from personal income tax, corporate tax and other taxes.
With regard to notifying taxpayers for non-disclosure of foreign assets, Agarwal said the tax department gets all details about foreign assets from nations under the automatic exchange of information and match such details with the disclosures in the ITRs.
""The basic intent is to remind taxpayers to declare the foreign assets. They can file revised return by December 31,"" he said.
Foreign assets include foreign bank accounts, foreign cash value insurance, financial interest in any business/entity, immovable property outside India, foreign equity or debit interest, accounts in which an assessee has signing authority, and any other capital assets.
When asked about the progress in
income tax law review
, the CBDT chief said that public consultation is ongoing and more than 6,000 suggestions have been received by the department.
""I would invite tax payers to come forward and give suggestions on international best practice, statute,"" he added.
Last month, the CBDT's internal committee invited public inputs for review of the the six-decade-old I-T Act with regard to simplification of language, litigation reduction, compliance reduction, and obsolete provisions. The CBDT has set up 22 specialised sub-committees to review various aspects of the Act.
Pursuant to the Budget announcement by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for a comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act, 1961, the CBDT had set up an internal committee to oversee the review and make the Act concise, clear, and easy to understand, which will reduce disputes, litigation, and provide greater tax certainty to taxpayers.

"India likely to attract $20-25 billion FPI inflows in FY25, recent outflow temporary: Bank of Baroda",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-likely-to-attract-20-25-billion-fpi-inflows-in-fy25-recent-outflow-temporary-bank-of-baroda/articleshow/115402635.cms,18-11-2024,"Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows into India are projected to remain positive in FY25, with an expected inflow of USD 20-25 billion, according to a report by
Bank of Baroda
.
Despite recent outflows from the Indian markets, the report suggested that this is a temporary trend and a reversal in FPI flows will happen in FY 25 because of the strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the country.
The report said, ""Given India's robust macro fundamentals, the recent bout of FPI outflows is likely to be only temporary. For FY25, we expect
FPI inflows
to be positive at USD 20-25bn in FY25"".
It also noted that India's external and fiscal deficits are under control, while economic growth remains resilient. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also built a substantial foreign exchange reserve of over USD 675 billion, which can be deployed strategically to support the domestic currency if needed.
The recent outflow of capital by foreign investors from emerging markets, including India, is attributed to a knee-jerk reaction to global developments.

These include the recalibration of expectations surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cut cycle and political uncertainties following Donald Trump's re-election in the United States.
However, the report believes these outflows are likely to reverse as markets gain clarity on U.S. fiscal and monetary policies.
The report mentioned that India remains a favored destination for foreign investors, given its robust economic growth prospects. Even conservative estimates place India's GDP growth at above 7 per cent, making it one of the fastest-growing economies globally.
For investors seeking higher returns, the report said that emerging markets like India continue to be attractive over the long term.
""EM markets continue to be attractive for investors seeking higher returns. India's growth fundamentals remain on a strong footing with GDP growth expected to be above 7 pc even by a conservative estimate"" the report stated.
The positive outlook for FPI inflows also bodes well for the Indian Rupee compared to dollar and financial markets. With its strong fundamentals and strategic policy framework, India is well-positioned to benefit from foreign investment in the coming fiscal year.

As on August 1, there was an outstanding
tax demand
of ₹26.13 lakh crore, of which over Rs 9 lakh crore was in the 'difficult to recover' category. The Mumbai zone has the maximum outstanding amount, followed by Delhi and Gujarat zones. They also have maximum recovery targets.
Officials said that based on data available with the department, the top 5,000 cases of 'arrear demand' cover almost 60% of the total demand and the department is focussing on these cases. The field formations were asked to work on cases which are not under the 'difficult to recover' category with a more focused and targeted approach to manage tax demands.
Every zone was asked to create a special team comprising the principal commissioner of income tax to provide analytics of cases falling under the 'top 5,000' identified by the CBDT.
""Data analytics is helping in being more specific with the recovery process and officers are using this to categorise demands which are over 10-year-old and where the person is either dead or missing,"" the official cited earlier said, adding that officials have also been asked to give a list of cases for write-offs.

Own-source revenue for panchayats remains low at Rs 59 per capita,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/own-source-revenue-for-panchayats-remains-low-at-rs-59-per-capita/articleshow/115358709.cms,16-11-2024,"Own Source Revenue (OSR) generation for
panchayats
remains low, with the income through tax collected by the
rural local governance
bodies on an average being just Rs 59 per capita between 2017 and 2022, according to
government data
. Even as the generation of OSR for panchayats has come into focus to give these rural bodies more
financial autonomy
, according to the data compiled by the
Panchayati Raj ministry
, between 2017 and 2022, only an amount of Rs 5,118.98 crore was raised as OSR by the panchayats.
This comes down to Rs 59 per capita and Rs 2.27 lakh per panchayat over the five-year period for 2.25 lakh gram panchayats across the country. The total population coming under these panchayats was more than 86.95 crore in the said period.
Among the states, Gujarat collected the highest amount as OSR at Rs 829.75 crore, while Kerala came second collecting Rs 802.95 crore.
Andhra Pradesh, which raised Rs 791.93 crore, occupied the third position, followed by Karnataka (Rs 627.56 crore), Tamil Nadu (Rs 516.3 crore) and West Bengal (Rs 435.17 crore).
In terms of the per capita OSR raised by the panchayats, Goa topped the list with Rs 1,635 raised in taxes per person, followed by Puducherry, which raised Rs 757 per capita.
Live Events
At a one-of-its-kind conclave organised by the Panchayati Raj ministry recently, in which representatives from the 16th Finance Commission participated along with officials from the ministries of Panchayati Raj, rural development, finance, housing and urban affairs, experts and representatives from the state finance commissions and other relevant institutions, the issue of panchayats raising their own resources was discussed.
However, according to the information shared by the ministry at the conclave, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Ladakh and Lakshadweep are among the states and Union territories that do not have OSR rules.
Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Puducherry, meanwhile, have framed these rules.
Panchayats, which act as grassroot-level bodies to implement government programmes and for achieving the sustainable development goals, get grants from the Centre, state governments, as well as raise their own revenue in a limited way through internal sources like local-tax revenues and user charges, and from external sources, including grants from international bodies like the World Bank.
The total 15th Finance Commission fund allocation to rural bodies is around Rs 2.36 lakh crore (2021-22 to 2025-26). Of this, around 60 per cent is ""Tied Grants"", which include heads like drinking water supply, rainwater harvesting, sanitation and maintenance services, while around 40 per cent is ""Untied Grants"" for improving basic services.
For panchayats to generate OSR, the states may authorise them to levy taxes, duties, tolls and fees, and it strengthens the panchayat identity as a local government through tax-based OSR. However, limited elected representatives' hesitance and administrative limitations often restrict it.
Matching grants based on OSR have been used as one of the ways by the Centre to encourage panchayats, like in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, up to three times of the OSR is given as incentive.
Sharing of royalties from local mining and Goods and Services Tax (GST) and District Mineral Fund (DMF) revenues with gram panchayats are among other the means for these rural bodies to raise their own revenue.
The government has also been pushing for the utilisation of tools like the SVAMITVA data for property-tax assessments to enable the rural local bodies to raise more funds.

Arvind Panagariya
said on Thursday. Speaking at a one-Day Finance Commissions Conclave themed ""Devolution to Development"" organised by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Panagariya also said that a convergence is being witnessed in the demands of the
urban and rural local bodies
.
At the conclave, which aims at facilitating crucial deliberations on addressing systemic challenges, ensuring timely constitution of State Finance Commissions, implementation of recommendations and strengthening institutional mechanisms to ensure a smooth flow of funds to the
Panchayati Raj Institutions
(PRIs), fostering financial autonomy and self-reliance among the Panchayats was among the topics in focus.
The issue of
Panchayat finances
, including devolution of funds, functions and functionaries, along with strategies to enhance local revenue sources were among the key issues.
Panagariya said that local bodies should look at raising their own resources as well.
""From the view point of service provision it is important to raise some own resources also... when citizens pay taxes, they are also aware of services that ought to be rendered to them,"" he said.

""It is also the logic of devolution of the functions at local levels. Locals know what they need and want. That knowledge will convert into a more activist kind of demand.""
Panagariya said it will also mobilise the citizens.
""In some way efforts should be made by the panchayats and urban local bodies to raise at least some part of their revenues from their own jurisdiction. That is an important way to mobilise citizenry in terms of its expectations and demands,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Panchayati Raj Secretary Vivek Bharadwaj said the conclave brings together stakeholders so that there is an integration in thought and action.
""For the 2.5 lakh Panchayats and people, the Finance Commission is responsible for devolution of resources. We have been trying that there should be an integration of action and thought between the central and state finance commissions. Through this conclave, all stakeholders have come on one platform,"" he said.
The conclave being organised by the Panchayati Raj Ministry brings together key representatives from the 16th Finance Commission, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, as well as eminent experts and representatives from the State Finance Commissions and other relevant institutions.

Also, the income tax liability of those earning above Rs 50 lakh has gone up 3.2 times, from Rs 2.52 lakh crore in 2014, to Rs 9.62 lakh crore in 2024.
A source said that 76 per cent of income tax collected is from those earning above Rs 50 lakh a year. This has led to reduced tax burden on the middle class.
Also, the increase in number of people filing ITRs with annual income above Rs 50 lakh is due to ""strong anti tax evasion and black money laws implemented by the Modi government"", the source added.
The source further said that in 2014, individuals earning above Rs 2 lakh a year had to pay income tax. However, because of various exemptions and deductions announced by the Modi government, individuals earning up to Rs 7 lakh need not pay any taxes.
The percentage of income tax collection from taxpayers earning less than Rs 10 lakh has reduced, from 10.17 per cent of the total tax paid in 2014, to 6.22 per cent in 2024.
Live Events
According to the source, the income tax liability of those earning between Rs 2.5 and Rs 7 lakh was an average Rs 43,000 in 2023-24, which is around 4-5 per cent of their income -- a level which is the lowest amongst emerging economies.
The source further said that as per official calculations, after adjusting
inflation
over the 10-year period, there is almost 60 per cent decrease in tax liability for those earning in the range of Rs 10-20 lakh.
The number of income tax returns filed by individuals have increased, from over 3.60 crore in 2013-14, to 7.97 crore in 2023-24, representing an increase of 121 per cent.

"India may cut import taxes if desi companies are not hurt, FM Sitharaman says",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/import-taxes-india-may-cut-import-duties-if-local-companies-are-not-affected-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-says-amid-donald-trump-tariff-worries/articleshow/115216289.cms,12-11-2024,"India’s Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
has said the country could consider easing some import taxes, as long as these changes in duties do not harm domestic businesses. Her comments suggest a possible softening of India’s trade policies, following remarks by US president-elect
Donald Trump
, who called India the “biggest charger” of tariffs.
“It is possible to explain every tariff we have levied,” Bloomberg cited Sitharaman saying during an event hosted by Republic Media Network in New Delhi on Tuesday. Sitharaman said she has “responsibility” to protect Indian companies.
Sitharaman said the government can “lift tariffs” on imports, provided it does not hinder the nation’s manufacturing capability. “I have to balance the two,” she said.
Her statement comes after Trump promised reciprocal actions against countries like India for imposing high import taxes on US goods.
The US has become India’s top trade partner, with two-way trade reaching $119.7 billion in the last fiscal year—a rise of over one-third in five years. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit with India has been widening, reflecting India’s export strength even in the face of restrictive tariffs.
Live Events
India's growing presence in the US market highlights its competitive edge in certain sectors and positions the country well to benefit as global supply chains evolve and trade policies shift.
Trump’s second term, according to a report by Elara Capital, offers a mixed but broadly positive outlook for India’s economy. While indirect effects on some Indian exports are possible, sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, electronics manufacturing services (EMS), and defence are anticipated to gain from Trump’s expected economic and foreign policies. Elara Capital remains bullish on Indian equities, especially in resilient sectors such as IT, pharma, EMS, and defence.
Trump’s tough stance on China could also play to India’s advantage, potentially redirecting US investments from China to India, which would support Indian markets and boost manufacturing. Supply chains have already started shifting towards India, and Trump’s re-election may accelerate this trend.
During Trump’s 2017–2021 presidency, India-US relations made significant progress, bolstered by the close rapport between Trump and Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
. However, there were also tensions. In his first term, Trump branded India the “tariff king,” and in an August interview, he criticised India’s tax rates as being excessively high.
In 2019, India imposed retaliatory tariffs on several US goods in response to Washington’s refusal to exempt India from increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. During his last term, Trump had also removed India’s preferential trade status amid tariff disputes.

Go splurge! India may lift spending limits to hit record capex goals,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-may-relax-spending-limits-to-meet-fy25-capex-target-source-says/articleshow/115204583.cms,12-11-2024,"India is considering the relaxation of quarterly spending limits to ensure it does not fall short of its capital expenditure target for the financial year 2024/2025, according to a government source.
Federal government spending slowed during April-June due to the national elections, with total expenditure in six months through September at about 44% of the full-year target.
Analysts say the weaker spending is one of the reasons for a recent slowdown in India's high frequency economic indicators.
India's industrial output dropped for the first time in nearly two years in August but is expected to grow 2.5% in September, according to a Reuters poll.
""Capital expenditure will pick up in the coming months, and we will ensure as much as possible capex happens in January-March,"" said the government source, who declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media.
Live Events
The
finance ministry
did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Capital expenditure, or spending on building physical infrastructure, was at 4.15 trillion rupees ($49.18 billion) during April-September, or 37% of the annual target, against 4.9 trillion rupees a year earlier.
The government targets capital expenditure at a record 11.11 trillion rupees in the fiscal year ending March 31.
The government is unlikely to alter its market borrowing for the fiscal year 2024/2025, as the plan was firmed up considering the higher redemption of loans availed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the source said.
This would also impact the gross borrowing in 2025/26, which may see a spike due to repayments even as the net borrowing may not be as high, the source said.
The government aims to borrow a gross amount of 14.01 trillion rupees through bonds in the current financial year.
In fiscal year 2021, India borrowed 12.6 trillion rupees, up from 7.1 trillion rupees in the previous year as revenues dried up due to lockdowns. Borrowings have remained elevated since then.

Health insurance tax relief coming soon? GST Council may consider lowering tax rates on insurance in December meeting,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/health-insurance-tax-relief-coming-soon-gst-council-may-consider-lowering-tax-rates-on-insurance-in-december-meeting/articleshow/115203919.cms,12-11-2024,"The
GST Council
will likely look at lowering the tax rate on certain insurance plans during its upcoming meeting in Rajasthan on December 21st and 22nd, according to a ToI report.
The GST Council in its upcoming meeting may completely remove the 18% tax on
term insurance
plans. The Council will also consider eliminating the tax on health insurance for senior citizens and those buying coverage up to Rs 5 lakh.
However, broader changes to GST rates for other goods and services are unlikely at this meeting. Several states, including Kerala and West Bengal, are concerned about potential revenue loss if taxes are lowered. Most non-NDA governed states opposed reducing the GST rate slabs from four to three. Currently, goods and services are taxed at rates of 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with the 18% and 28% slabs making up about three-quarters of total revenue.
Concerns about revenue loss have also slowed any broad reduction in GST on health insurance, which generates around Rs 2,500 crore. States are cautious about losing this revenue, especially since the Centre is no longer compensating them for shortfalls. A group of ministers, led by Bihar’s Deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, has already put together a proposal on reducing GST for health insurance, which is the least controversial of the main issues under review.
Another panel, led by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, is reviewing the future of the compensation cess. However, a decision on this is expected only by late 2025, as the cess on luxury and ""sin"" goods will remain in place until March 2026.
Live Events
While some discussions have explored reducing GST on essential items and increasing it on luxury goods, no concrete decisions are expected during this meeting. The emphasis for now remains on insurance.
Why India is calling for health insurance GST cut
The demands for junking indirect tax on health insurance came to limelight afer Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari demanded so in a letter to India's finance minister earlier this year. FM Nirmala Sitharaman later said the letter wasn’t meant to be public.
In a nation with significant income inequality and pressing needs for enhanced healthcare infrastructure, many Indians are questioning why they should be taxed on healthcare—a service widely viewed as essential. Insurance penetration in India remains much lower than in many other countries, and taxes add an extra burden on citizens who seek medical insurance.
A group of ministers (GoM) was tasked by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council to oversee rate rationalisation, is considering lowering the GST on premiums paid for life and health insurance policies. This potential reduction could offer a good financial relief to individuals and families having insurance coverage.
However, there's a concern that insurance companies may keep the benefit of lwer GST on insurance for themselves and not pass it on to people buying health insurance, a state finance minister had told ToI in September. Another minister said that although there’s pressure to lower the burden on consumers, companies have been raising premiums ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, citing increased claims. While COVID-related claims have since decreased, insurance companies haven’t given any relief to policyholders. Instead, they claim that the cost of handling claims is still higher than the premiums they collect.

'Govt FY25 spends to be in sync with Budget estimates of ₹48.2 lakh cr',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/govt-fy25-spends-to-be-in-sync-with-budget-estimates-of-48-2-lakh-cr/articleshow/115190131.cms,12-11-2024,"New Delhi: The government’s total expenditure in the current fiscal may remain around the budgeted Rs 48.2 lakh crore, despite a batch of supplementary demands for grants that will be placed for parliamentary approval in the winter session, starting November 25, a senior official said. This will help the Centre meet the 2024-25 fiscal deficit goal of 4.9% of gross domestic product, he said.
A large part of the additional expenditure demands may be met through savings or enhanced receipts of various ministries and departments, without letting the overall spending to skyrocket, he indicated.
He hinted that the overall 2024-25 subsidy outgo may remain within the budgeted limit of Rs 4.28 lakh crore, even though there could be variations in the dole-out amounts earmarked for each of the major segments.
The finance ministry wrapped up its pre-budget meetings with various ministries and departments on Monday. It will now move on to the process of firming up the revised estimates for this fiscal and the budget estimates for the next.
'Capital spending to pick up'
The government expects capital spending to accelerate in the coming months after a sluggish first half and reach targeted Rs 11.11 lakh crore this fiscal, the official said. It may waive the spending limit for the March quarter to boost such productive expenditure, if required, he added.

The Centre is nudging all states to fully utilise the 50-year interest-free loans (Rs 1.5 lakh crore for 2024-25) earmarked for them to create capital assets, he said. Under the scheme for special assistance to states for capital investment, their projects worth only Rs 50,069 crore were approved in the first half of 2024-25. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been regularly reviewing the capex this fiscal.
The Centre has raised its capital spending outlay for FY25 by 17.1% from a year before. However, expenditure in the first half of the fiscal fell 15.4% from a year before, reflecting the impact of the general election in the June quarter on project execution and heavy monsoon downpours in August and September.
The government has been sharply raising its annual capital spending since the pandemic, betting big on the high multiplier effect of such productive expenditure to spur economic growth.
Higher 2025-26 gross market borrowing
The Centre’s gross market borrowing through dated securities may go up in the next financial year to accommodate a part of its repayment obligations against the loans taken to meet the spike in the spending requirement during the pandemic, he said.
However, it has already initiated steps to smoothen the repayment process by conducting buybacks of about Rs 80,000 crore and switches of Rs 1.35 lakh crore this fiscal to avoid a heavy burden in 2025-26, he added.
The net market borrowing, therefore, is unlikely to see a commensurate hike, he indicated. The government is sticking to its FY25 gross market borrowing at the budgeted level of Rs 14.01 lakh crore, which was down from Rs 15.43 lakh crore a year before. The net market borrowing is budgeted at Rs 11.63 lakh crore for the current fiscal, compared with Rs 11.80 lakh crore in 2023-24.

RBI steps keep average call rates in check,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-steps-keep-average-call-rates-in-check/articleshow/114990193.cms,05-11-2024,"Mumbai: The
Reserve Bank of India
has been actively managing surplus
liquidity
in the
banking system
by conducting variable rate repo and variable rate reverse repo auctions to absorb or inject liquidity, so that the weighted average call rate (
WACR
) aligns with the repo rate of 6.50%. However, the tri-party repo (
Treps
) segment in the overnight market has witnessed rates below the repo rate for the past four months.
The bulk of the volume in the overnight segment is in the Treps segment, where the rate has been about 12 basis points lower than repo.
Liquidity management is a key aspect of monetary policy, said Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist at
IDFC First Bank
. ""So, in any stance, their aim will be to make sure the WACR stays as close as possible to the repo rate. The WACR is somewhat aligned to the repo but, more importantly, the Treps rate has been below the repo rate since July.""
The Treps rate was 6.34% in October and 6.42% in September, show
RBI
data. The Treps segment permits participation by a broader set of market participants such as mutual funds and insurance companies in addition to banks. While the RBI regulates banks, others like insurers do not fall under the RBI's jurisdiction.
The WACR for October was 6.35%, as the RBI conducted 14 variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions to absorb excess liquidity. Banking system liquidity on an average was a surplus of ₹1.47 lakh crore, data showed. The WACR was 6.52% in September when the RBI conducted eight VRRR auctions and four variable rate repo (VRR) auctions as liquidity went into a brief deficit mode that month. The average surplus in September was ₹1.05 lakh crore.

CBDT sets monetary limit to waive interest,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cbdt-sets-monetary-limit-to-waive-interest/articleshow/114966771.cms,05-11-2024,"The central board of direct taxes (CBDT) has set monetary limitations for waiver or Reduction of Interest on Tax Payments with riders.
According to the circular issued late night Monday, principal chief commissioners of Income Tax can waive up to Rs. 50 lakhs, chief commissioners or director generals of Income Tax can waive between Rs. 50 lakhs and Rs. 1.5 crores, and principal chief commissioners of Income Tax can waive interest above Rs. 1.5 crores.
The notification will be effective Tuesday.
The interest waiver or reduction will be considered if payment of the amount would cause genuine hardship to the taxpayer, or if default was due to circumstances beyond their control, the circular said.
Taxpayers must also co-operate in assessment or recovery proceedings, the circular added.

Although the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data does not give the source of dividend and profits, a sizable portion of private equity exits comprising dividend and profits get reflected in the investment income. Capital gains made from enhanced valuations are part of the

— not income outflows.
Private equity exits in the first half of 2024 reached a six-year high, according to a report by US-based consultancy Bain & Co.

Exit Deal Values Up 40% YoY
Exit deal values grew by 40% year-on-year, from $9.5 billion in the first half of calendar 2023 to $13.3 billion in the first half of 2024.
“PE firms made good profits over the last couple of years as surging stock markets gave them good valuations for their investments in listed firms, giving them an opportunity to give good returns to the investors,” said Kuntal Sur, partner-risk consulting and leader-financial services and treasury risk management, PwC India. “Besides, for many investors, there have been many reinvestment opportunities in their home countries as interest rates were high.” Profits and dividends taken out of investments made in India by multinational companies are also reflected in the investment income.
“There are two factors. One is to add to overall revenue at a time when profits are volatile due to a slowdown” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda. “Second, there is less need felt for reinvestment given excess capacity in some sectors of manufacturing.” Pressure on current account From the balance of payments perspective, investment income is a part of “invisibles” in the current account.
Invisibles essentially comprise income from various services, remittances by the diaspora, repatriations by foreigners to their families back home and income from various investments in debt, equity and fixed income instruments. To be sure, an unbridled surge in such outflows could add to the pressure on the current account and be detrimental to the external sector indicators. But economists say that it is still a small part of the current account outflows.

GST mopup rises 8.9% to ₹1.87 lakh crore in October,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-mopup-rises-8-9-to-1-87-lakh-core-in-october/articleshow/114859130.cms,02-11-2024,"India collected ₹ 1.87 lakh crore in goods and services tax in October, marking the second-highest gross
GST collection
in any month to date, reflecting the resilience of the country's economy amid global uncertainties.
The collection was up 8.9% year on year.
Even when collections from customs and imports remained muted last month, festival demand kept the collections high with
domestic GST
collections rising 10.7% on year to ₹1.42 lakh crore, official data released on Friday showed. ""GST collections close to 1.9 lakh crore and increase in GST collections on domestic supplies by 10% plus depict the robustness of the Indian economy,"" said Abhishek Jain, indirect tax head and partner at
KPMG
.
While most of the large states have shown an increase above the national average of 9%, GST collections from Tamil Nadu, Telangana and poll-bound Jharkhand were comparatively weak.
""The increase in GST collections on domestic supplies for the month and on a cumulative basis for FY24 is 10.5% compared to FY24 , indicating that domestic demand has largely been uniformly high during FY24,"" said MS Mani, tax partner at Deloitte India. Revenues from tax on imports rose about 4% to ₹45,096 crore.

The net GST revenue last month stood at ₹1.68 lakh crore, up 7.9% from October 2023, as there was a significant surge in processing of GST refunds.
Experts, however, remain cautious on the short-term outlook, saying recent global development may impact domestic demand even as the long-term tax collection prospects remain robust.
""Despite short-term uncertainties, the long-term prospects for GST collections remain promising due to India's expanding consumer base and the government's pro-growth policies,"" said Saurabh Agarwal, tax partner at EY.
He said November collections will be crucial to determine a short-term outlook. ""The collections made this month on account of the festive season, particularly the performance of the automobile sector, will be crucial in determining the short-term trend,"" Agarwal said.
The government collected ₹33,821 crore as central GST last month, while state GST collection stood at ₹41,864 crore, integrated IGST at ₹99,111 crore and cess at ₹12,550 crore.

GST records second-highest collection at Rs 1.87 lakh crore in October driven by domestic sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-collects-22-25-bln-in-goods-and-services-tax-in-october/articleshow/114845620.cms,01-11-2024,"New Delhi: Gross
GST
collection in October rose 9 per cent to over Rs 1.87 lakh crore, the second-highest ever, on pick-up in domestic sales and improved compliance. The Central GST collection stood at Rs 33,821 crore, State GST at Rs 41,864 crore, Integrated IGST at Rs 99,111 crore and cess at Rs 12,550 crore during the month.
As per the government data released on Friday, the total gross Goods and Services
Tax
(GST) revenue grew 8.9 per cent to Rs 1,87,346 crore. In October 2023, the mop-up was at Rs 1.72 lakh crore.
October 2024 recorded the second-best GST mop-up. The highest ever collection was in April 2024 at over Rs 2.10 lakh crore.
During the month under review, GST from domestic transactions grew 10.6 per cent to Rs 1.42 lakh crore, while revenues from tax on imports rose about 4 per cent to Rs 45,096 crore.
Refunds worth Rs 19,306 crore were issued during the month, registering 18.2 per cent growth over the year-ago period.
Live Events
After adjusting refunds, net GST collection grew 8 per cent at over Rs 1.68 lakh crore.
Deloitte India Partner MS Mani said the buoyancy in
GST collections
is on account of an excellent combination of festive season sales and increased compliance.
""The driver appears to be domestic supplies... While many large states have recorded an increase in GST revenue above 9 per cent, some of them and many of the smaller states have shown a below average increase, which would be an area of concern for those states,"" Mani said.
EY Tax Partner Saurabh Agarwal, however, said the single-digit growth in monthly GST collections signals a cooling-off period, indicating a potential slowdown in consumer spending in India, which surged in the previous fiscal year.
He said the November collections will show a better picture of the festive demand and the performance of the automobile sector will be crucial in determining the short-term trend.
""While the festive season is expected to boost collections, the overall outlook for the near future remains cautious despite short-term uncertainties, the long-term prospects for GST collections remain promising due to India's expanding consumer base and the government's pro-growth policies,"" Agarwal said.
KPMG Indirect Tax Head & Partner, Abhishek Jain, said the collections depict the robustness of the economy.
Deloitte India, Partner and Leader, Indirect Tax, Mahesh Jaising said ""as we look ahead to the November GST Council meeting, key discussions on streamlining the tax rate structure and continued focus on trade facilitation areas are expected.""
The GST Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister and comprising state counterparts, are slated to meet this month and take up the recommendations of the Group of Ministers (GoM) on rate rationalisation on over 100 items.

""The investors' interest is ranging from a full
acquisition
of Centrum Housing Finance, to a majority or minority
stake sale
as well. We are exploring all the possibilities but at the end of the day, the decision will depend upon the valuation and counterparty. The deal will be finalized before the end of this financial year. Bindra said.
The group with interests ranging from banking to wealth management holds about 60% in the
mortgage lending
arm while Morgan Stanley has 25% stake. The balance is held by employees and others.
It started scouting for an investor around this time last year and engaged EY for this.
Earlier in 2022, the Centrum group transferred all its lending businesses except housing finance
business
to Unity Small Finance Bank, which is 51% owned by it. The housing business could not be transferred since it is partly owned by Morgan Stanley.
Centrum Housing Finance, which commenced operations in 2017, acquired the business of National Trust Housing Finance (Natrust) in December 2022 to enter the southern market.
Centrum group's consolidated
revenue
stood at Rs 868 crore at the end of September, up 61% over Rs 537 crore seen in the year ago period. Its EBITDA was at Rs 401 crore, up 68% over the same period.

Fiscal deficit in 1st Half of FY25 drops to 29.4% of annual target,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/fiscal-deficit-in-1st-half-of-fy25-drops-to-29-4-of-annual-target/articleshow/114788762.cms,30-10-2024,"The central government's
fiscal deficit
in the first half of 2024-25 touched 29.4% of the annual target, compared with 39.3% a year before, as it kept a lid on expenditure, showed official data released on Wednesday.
The lower deficit, experts said, will enable the government to contain its fiscal gap at the targeted 4.9% in 2024-25, despite a potential drop in
disinvestment revenue
. In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit stood at ₹4.75 lakh crore, against ₹7.02 lakh crore a year earlier. This is mainly because of a lower fiscal deficit earlier in the year when the resource mop-up had remained strong and
government spending
was constrained by the general elections.
The government aims to contain its fiscal deficit at 4.9% of gross domestic product (
GDP
) in 2024-25 and below 4.5% in 2025-26. The deficit had widened in August on the back of a post-poll spurt in revenue spending, but it shrank again in September by 33.4% from a year earlier to ₹39,344 crore.
Capital spending
hit its peak this fiscal in September but—at ₹1.14 lakh crore—it still remained 2.4% lower than a year before. Experts blamed heavy monsoon downpours in various parts of the country for faltering project executions in recent months.
Live Events
Meeting the FY25 capital spending target of ₹11.11 lakh crore would now entail a considerable expansion of 52% in the second half of this fiscal from a year before, said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar. “This appears rather challenging at this juncture,” she added.
The capex target miss could provide “some cushion to absorb the shortfall on account of disinvestments and taxes,” Nayar reckoned. She said the 2024-25 fiscal deficit will likely print in line with or trail the target of ₹16.1 lakh crore, or 4.9% of the GDP. Revenue expenditure in the first half of this fiscal grew just 4.2% from a year earlier to ₹16.97 lakh crore, against the annual target of a 6.2% rise.
The government’s major subsidy payout (on account of food, fertiliser and fuels) in the first half touched 56% of the annual estimate, compared with 55% a year earlier.
The pace of increase in net tax receipts in the first half of this fiscal touched 9% year-on-year, lower than the full-year target of 11.1%, to touch ₹12.65 lakh crore. Non-tax revenue mop-up, boosted by a record RBI dividend windfall of ₹2.11 lakh crore, surged 50.9% to ₹3.57 lakh crore.

The Ministry of Labour and Employment, along with the EPFO, has taken systemic reforms at the retirement fund body as one of its priorities in the first 100 days of the new government to ensure seamless transactions.
Labour and employment minister
Mansukh Mandaviya
last month approved the centralised pension payment system (CPPS) under the Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995, to enable 7.8 million EPS subscribers to withdraw pension from any bank and any branch across India.
Besides, it will also ensure disbursement of pension throughout India without any need for transfer of
pension payment orders
(PPOs) from one office to another, even when the pensioner moves from one location to another or changes his bank or branch.

fiscal deficit
for the first half of this fiscal year through September stood at 4.75 lakh crore rupees, or 29.4% of annual estimates, government data showed today.
The fiscal deficit widened from 39.3% reported in the comparable year-earlier period.
Total receipts stood at 16.37 lakh crore rupees, while overall expenditure in April to September was at 21.11 lakh crore rupees. They were 51% and 43.8% of this fiscal year's
budget target
.
Total receipts in the year-earlier period was at 52.2% of estimate, while expenditure narrowed from 49% a year earlier.
Revenue receipts stood at 16.22 lakh crore rupees, of which tax revenue was 12.65 lakh crore rupees and non-tax revenue was 3.57 lakh crore rupees.
Live Events
Tax and non-tax revenues were 49% and 65.5% of the budgeted estimate. While tax revenue was narrower than 49.8% of budget estimate in the last fiscal year, non-tax revenue swelled from 78.5% of budget forecast in the same period last year.
Non-tax revenue jumped as the Reserve Bank of India transferred Rs 2.11 lakh crore as surplus to the central government. The dividend payout is more than double the amount budgeted from the central bank and state-run lenders.
Revenue deficit was at 74,155 crore rupees or 12% of the fiscal year's budget target, data showed. Revenue deficit narrowed from 26.6% last year.
On the expenditure side, New Delhi spent about 2.15 lakh crore rupees on major subsidies such as food, fertilisers and petroleum. This was 56% of the annual aim, tad wider than 55% of budgeted expenditure in the comparable period last year.
While announcing the federal budget for this fiscal year that started April 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman revised the
fiscal gap
aim down to 4.9%, well below the 5.1%
budget gap
pegged in the Interim budget. Sitharaman also pegged the fiscal deficit target at 5.1% for the next fiscal year.
In the Budget, the government stuck to its fiscal consolidation roadmap even as coalition parties demanded more funds from the Modi government and the middle class urged for tax relief measures.
The lower fiscal deficit target for 2025-26 was expected on hopes of strong tax collections, despite the government’s continued capex push that is crucial to shore up consumption and create jobs and help India achieve its aim to be world’s third largest economy by 2030.

While the value of gold has risen by close to $20 billion in 2024 to $62 billion at the end of August, India's - predominantly RBI's investment in US treasury securities is up $11 billion to $245 billion in the same period. In addition to global economic uncertainties, US treasury prices have fallen in 2024 due to the Fed tightening policy rates making investments in these bonds unattractive if the intention is to trade in the portfolio. The value of gold had further jumped to $67 billion by mid October, the Reserve Bank of India data shows.
""RBI’s forex reserves have grown by $43bn in FY'25 till Oct 18t. Most of the increase took place in Q2FY25 due to revaluation gains. During this period, UST yields were lower, there was dollar weakness and gold prices continued to climb"" said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist at IDFC Bank.
Central banks across the world including India's and China's a aggressively buying gold as a safe have asset though profit is not a motive."" While safety and liquidity constitute the twin objectives of reserve management in India, return optimization is kept in view within this framework"" said the central bank's latest "" Half Yearly Report on Management of
Foreign Exchange Reserves
"".
In value terms (USD), the share of gold in the total foreign exchange reserves increased from 8.15 per cent as at end-March 2024 to about 9.32 per cent as at end-September 2024.

At the end of March 2024, 387.26 metric tonnes of gold were kept with the Bank of England and the BIS while 26.53 metric tonnes were held in the form of gold deposits, according to the RBI's half-yearly report for October-March.
In June, RBI governor
Shaktikanta Das
had said that while the quantum of gold held by the central bank outside the country was static for a long time, in recent years data had shown that the monetary authority had been buying gold as a part of its reserve management and the quantum held outside was going up.
""We have domestic capacity now, and we felt part of the gold should be stored within the country. That is it. Nothing more should be read into it,"" Das had said at the RBI's June monetary policy press conference.
The RBI's foreign exchange reserves increased to $705.78 billion as of September 30 from $646.42 billion as of March 31, the central bank said in its latest half-yearly report.
The RBI's foreign currency assets, which are maintained in major global currencies, are expressed in US dollar terms. Movements in the foreign currency assets occur primarily due to the purchase and sale of foreign exchange by the RBI, income arising out of the deployment of the foreign exchange reserves, external aid receipts of the central government and changes on account of revaluation of the assets, the central bank said.
Out of the RBI's total foreign currency assets worth $617.07 billion as of September, $515.30 billion, or 83.51% was invested in securities, $60.11 billion was deposited with other central banks and the BIS and the remaining $41.66 billion was made up of deposits with commercial banks overseas.
As of March 31, the RBI's total foreign currency assets were $570.95 billion, of which $468.99 billion, or 82.14%, was invested in securities.

The
MSME Development Act
prescribes a 45-day payment timeline for buyers to make payments if they are buying from the MSMEs. If the buyers fail to pay within 45 days, they are liable to pay interest at three times the prevalent
bank rate
on the pending amount.
Last year, the Centre introduced amendments to the Income Tax Act to ensure that the pending amount to MSMEs becomes ineligible for deduction from the income of the entity. The move was aimed at prodding entities, which were buying from these businesses to settle their dues quickly.

RBI ups domestically-held gold by another 102 metric tonnes in Apr-Sep,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-ups-domestically-held-gold-by-another-102-metric-tonnes-in-apr-sep/articleshow/114736908.cms,29-10-2024,"The Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) added another 102 metric tonnes to the
domestically held gold
in the April-September period, as per a disclosure made on Tuesday. The overall quantity of the precious metal stored in local safes stood at 510.46 metric tonnes as of September 30, which was up from over 408 metric tonnes as on March 31, 2024.
The central bank said it added another 32 metric tonnes of
gold reserves
in the six-month period to take the overall tonnage to 854.73 metric tonnes, as per the half yearly report on management of
foreign exchange reserves
.
India has been gradually moving gold reserves to local vaults -- said to be located in the financial capital and Nagpur -- over the past few years. In FY24, it had moved 100 metric tonnes more from the UK to domestic locations.
The movement of the commodity, happening at time of increased geopolitical tensions globally, was said to be one of the biggest movements of gold undertaken by India since 1991, when it had to pledge a substantial part of the gold holding to tide over a foreign exchange crisis that resulted in its movement out of vaults.
The RBI disclosure said 324.01 metric tonnes of gold were kept in safe custody with the Bank of England and the bank for international settlements (BIS) and 20.26 metric tonnes were held in the form of gold deposits.

In value terms, the share of gold in the total foreign exchange reserves increased from 8.15 per cent as at end-March 2024 to about 9.32 per cent as at end-September 2024 on the back of an increase in tonnage and also the surge in prices.
As of March this year, 413.79 metric tonnes of gold was held abroad, as per an RBI annual report.
In late May, sources had indicated that a call was taken to reduce the holding abroad that is part of the standard review procedures.
In 2009, India had bought 200 tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), after which it has been buying the precious commodity from the secondary market as part of its foreign exchange asset diversification efforts.
Typically, officials from the Ministry of Finance, the RBI and other agencies take care of the movement of gold in complete secrecy given the high value, as per the sources.

I-T dept notifies tolerance range for AY25 for transfer pricing cases,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/i-t-dept-notifies-tolerance-range-for-ay25-for-transfer-pricing-cases/articleshow/114729868.cms,29-10-2024,"The
income tax department
has notified the
tolerance range
for variation between
arm's length price
and
transfer pricing
for international and specified domestic transactions for Assessment Year 2024-25. The range has been retained at the same level as last year's -- one per cent for ""
wholesale trading
"" and three per cent for all other taxpayers, the
Central Board of Direct Taxes
(CBDT) said.
The term 'wholesale trading' will be defined as an international transaction or specified domestic transaction of trading in goods subject to certain conditions.
""The notification of tolerance range shall provide certainty to taxpayers and reduce the risk perception associated with the pricing of a transaction in transfer pricing,"" the CBDT said in a statement.
The 'tolerance range' means that if the arm's length price varies up to one per cent of the transaction price for wholesale trading and three per cent for other taxpayers, then the transaction price would be the arm's length price under the transfer pricing rules.
Under
tax laws
, transfer pricing refers to the pricing of the goods and services that are exchanged between related companies.
Live Events
Arm's length price refers to the price which is applied in a transaction between entities other than related parties.
Nangia & Co LLP Partner - Transfer Pricing Nitin Narang said the recently notified tolerance range for transfer pricing is applicable for cases where arithmetical mean is considered for computation of arm's length price/ margin.
""The notification of tolerance range also suggested that it shall provide certainty to taxpayers and reduce the risk perception associated with pricing of a transaction in transfer pricing. Similar to preceding years, no specific reason or clarification is given in relation to why a different tolerance limit is set for wholesale traders and others, and how the range of 3 per cent has been determined,"" Narang added.

estimate for fiscal 2025, because general elections had dragged down spending in the first half of the year.
The government in the July budget had sanctioned ₹1.5 lakh crore under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure. However, in the first half of the fiscal year, projects worth only ₹50,069 crore were approved. It may now lower the allocation to ₹1.30-1.35 lakh crore in the revised estimate, a senior official told ET.
""Because of general elections in the first half, states may not be able to utilise the complete amount and we see only 80-85% of the utilisation of funds,"" the official said.
The government is nudging states to increase their spending in the second half, but it may not match up the pace required to fully utilise the budgeted amount.
Pre-budget meetings to finalise revised estimates for FY25 are ongoing and will conclude by November 11. Under the scheme, the Centre extends 50-year loans to states to boost their durable assets creation. States are required to undertake stipulated reform measures to obtain a part of the
capex
loans that are conditional in nature. The Centre had increased the budgetary allocation under the scheme to ₹1.5 lakh crore for this fiscal year from ₹1.05 lakh crore last fiscal year.
Live Events
Out of this, ₹55,000 crore is unconditional loan, while disbursement of the remaining ₹95,000 crore is tied to different conditions including industrial growth, land reforms and capex growth by states.
Out of ₹95,000 crore conditional loan, the official said ₹25,000 crore is linked to capex achievement by states.
States will get 50% of the corresponding share if they have reported capex growth of 10% or more in FY24. For the remaining 50%, they must achieve 10% capex growth this fiscal year. State capex had been slow in the first half of this year.
Earlier this month, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman asked expenditure secretary Manoj Govil to coordinate with states to expedite the submission and approval of project proposals and ensure that they undertake capital investments in a timely and efficient manner.
The Centre had initially allocated ₹1.30 crore for FY24, but it was slashed in the interim budget by 19% to ₹1.05 lakh crore.
This was because states like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Punjab did not receive any funds in FY24 as they did not fulfil the conditions or failed to fully spend the amounts allocated to them in the previous fiscal year under the scheme.

Gold helps hold up forex reserves,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gold-helps-hold-up-forex-reserves/articleshow/114659783.cms,29-10-2024,"The Reserve Bank has added 31.6 tonnes to its stock of gold since the beginning of the fiscal. The volumes are up 4% over the levels as of March 31.
The outstanding stock of RBI’s

The RBI started buying gold from the markets in December 2017. The central bank has become more active in the last two to three years, particularly after the war between Ukraine and Russia early this year.
The RBI and the Chinese central bank are reckoned to be active buyers of gold in the international markets. The 25% rise in

The Ministry of Finance said that corporates now have until November 15, 2024, to submit their income tax returns, an extension from the original deadline of October 31, 2024.
The extension applies to taxpayers covered under sub-Section (1) of Section 139 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, it said in a media release.
Notably, the extension comes after the government extended the deadline to submit tax audit report to October 7, 2024, from the initial deadline of September 30, 2024.
The income tax law requires certain taxpayers to conduct an income tax audit and submit the report by September 30 of the assessment year.

AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said the CBDT's decision to extend the deadline for filing income tax returns for AY 2024-25, though not accompanied by an official explanation, seems aligned with the upcoming festive season.
""By extending the deadline to November 15, 2024, taxpayers and professionals alike can prioritise accuracy and compliance without the stress of last-minute filings amidst celebrations,"" PTI quoted Mohan as saying.
Jhunjhunwala said, ""This targeted extension seeks to facilitate compliance during a peak period while upholding the timely submission of critical audit documentation"".

RBI injects funds to rein in bank funding costs amid forex outflows,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-injects-funds-to-rein-in-bank-funding-costs-amid-forex-outflows/articleshow/114598548.cms,26-10-2024,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India's move on Friday to inject funds into the banking system despite the prevalence of a headline
liquidity surplus
reflects an adroit strategy by the central bank to ensure that recent overseas outflows from local capital markets and festival-related cash withdrawals do not drive up banks' cost of funds, analysts said.
The
RBI
's provision of a short-term liquidity window on Friday comes around two weeks after the central bank shifted its stance of monetary policy to neutral from one of withdrawal of accommodation. Money market experts broadly were of the view that the neutral stance, which provides the option for rates to be lowered or raised, signalled more central bank tolerance of easier liquidity conditions than the stance of withdrawal.
On Friday, the RBI infused funds worth Rs 25,000 crore through a
Variable Rate Repo
(VRR) auction, the first such operation since September 24 when a combination of quarterly advance tax outflows and goods and services tax payments had drained the system of funds. At Friday's auction, the RBI received bids worth Rs 48,700 crore from banks versus the notified amount of Rs 25,000 crore, reflecting the need for funds from lenders.
ET Bureau
""This appears like a fine-tuning exercise because headline liquidity as on October 24 is still in surplus. The reason is maybe because over the last few weeks, there has been some amount of pressure in the currency market, and it is likely that the RBI would have intervened,"" said Vivek Kumar, economist, Quanteco Research.

""The second aspect is that some part of the recent decline in liquidity surplus is because of the GST outflows while the third reason is that we are entering the Diwali phase which is typically a phase of very cash-heavy demand,"" he said.
With
foreign portfolio investors
having pulled out funds worth a record $9.6 billion, or Rs 80,954 crore, from Indian equity markets so far in October, the rupee has faced pressure, weakening past the 84/$1 mark for the first time earlier this month. The pace of depreciation in the currency, however, has been contained, likely due to interventions by the RBI in the form of dollar sales, analysts said. The RBI's stated position is that it intervenes in the currency market to prevent excess volatility in the exchange rate.
India's
foreign exchange reserves
fell by another $2.163 billion in the week ending October 18 to $688.26 billion. This is the third week in a row that the forex reserves fell - cumulatively by $16.61 billion from the all-time high of $704.88 billion, according to RBI data.
Dollar sales by the RBI drain the banking system of rupee liquidity. On Wednesday, surplus liquidity in the banking system - as measured by absorption of funds by the RBI - dropped to a one-month low of Rs 57,428.30 crore, central bank data showed. The shrinking cash surplus with banks pushed up the weighted average call rate (WACR) to 6.75% on Wednesday, 25 basis points higher than the repo rate of 6.50%.

Is there a chink in India's industrial armour? RBI MPC's Nagesh Kumar explains why a 25-bps rate cut is needed,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/is-there-a-chink-in-indias-industrial-armoury-rbi-mpcs-nagesh-kumar-explains-why-a-25-bps-rate-cut-is-needed/articleshow/114508448.cms,23-10-2024,"The RBI-led
Monetary Policy Committee
's new member,
Nagesh Kumar
, has expressed concerns over the ongoing demand deficits in both, domestic and international markets, in the minutes of the October meeting, released on Wednesday. Kumar attributed the slowdown to the lack of momentum in
private investment
.
He noted that despite companies having healthy balance sheets and the numerous reforms and incentives provided by the government, private investment is yet to gain momentum.
According to Kumar, weak demand is a major factor, contributing to the overall sluggishness in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. This demand slowdown has been evident in India’s export figures, which have shrunk by 9.3 per cent in August, as well as in the broader domestic market where core sectors such as cement, iron, steel, and chemicals have reported negative growth.
Kumar, who was the sole MPC member advocating for a 25 basis point
rate cut
in the latest meeting, opined that the weak demand is holding back the investment recovery.
A call for rate cuts
Given the current inflationary trends and the flagging demand in both domestic and export markets, Kumar argued that it is an opportune moment for the
RBI
to begin normalising monetary policy by cutting interest rates. He cautioned that if India does not follow the global trend of rate cuts, the rupee could appreciate further, potentially harming the competitiveness of Indian exports.
Live Events
Citing the successful anchoring of inflation expectations, Kumar advocated for a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate to help revive demand and boost private investment.
Kumar highlighted that while India remains the fastest-growing large economy globally, with relatively low inflation, exchange rate stability, and substantial foreign exchange reserves, emerging trends are indicating a potential economic slowdown.
Economic growth is projected to decelerate from 8.2 per cent in 2023-24 to 6.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2024-25. Despite the government’s infrastructure push through record capital expenditure, private investment has not responded as hoped, partly due to the higher cost of capital since the RBI started raising policy rates in March 2022.
Kumar also mentioned that general economic conditions, according to various surveys, have worsened compared to a year ago, with moderating business sentiment and demand across major manufacturing sectors. The Consumer Confidence Survey and the PMI for manufacturing also indicate weaknesses in both domestic and external demand, contributing to the overall slowdown.
Views on 'slowbalisation', 'China+1' strategy
Despite the challenges, Kumar identified an opportunity for India in the global shift towards diversifying supply chains, commonly referred to as the China+1 strategy.
As per the member, the disruptions caused by the pandemic have prompted global companies to reduce their reliance on China, and India could capitalise on this trend if it improves its investment climate, logistics, and cost of doing business.
Kumar pointed to
Apple
’s decision to expand iPhone production in India through its vendors like Foxconn as an example of this opportunity in action.
However, he warned that India must remain vigilant in maintaining its competitiveness, particularly in the face of growing protectionism and trade wars in the West. Large excess industrial capacities in China, combined with trade barriers, could pose significant challenges to India’s efforts to grow its manufacturing sector.
""The rise of protectionism in the West, trade wars, and the collapse of multilateral trade negotiations have turned globalization into ‘slowbalization.’ The situation is complicated further, especially for India, by large excess industrial capacities sitting next door in China, with access to the Western markets made more difficult, and the threat of predatory dumping in our markets is real,"" he stated.

Starting from this financial year, the government aims to provide two instalments of DA and DR annually to employees and pensioners, as clarified by
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan
in the legislative assembly, according to the statement.
Despite the financial challenges faced during the COVID-19 period, a better salary revision was implemented in Kerala, Balagopal said.
""The benefits, including DA, were provided in cash at the beginning of the 2021-22 financial year. However, due to unfavourable measures taken by the central government, Kerala faced an unusual financial crunch, causing delays in disbursing some employee benefits,"" the minister said.
Balagopal emphasised that the government remains committed to ensuring benefits for employees and pensioners.

"Digital payments surge: Cash usage declines post-pandemic in India, says study by RBI economist",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/digital-payments-surge-cash-usage-declines-post-pandemic-in-india-says-rbi/articleshow/114471507.cms,29-10-2024,"Sixty percent of consumer expenditure is still cash based as of March 2024. But its share is declining rapidly post COVID. The share of digital more than doubled in three years from 14-19 percent in March 2021 to 40 to 48 percent in March 2024, a study by an
RBI
economist showed.
“ A
cash usage
indicator (CUI) taking into account both physical and digital modes of payments indicates that the cash usage remains significant but has been declining during the period under study “ said the author Pradip Bhuyan from the Reserve Bank’s department of
currency management
in a paper titled ”Cash Usage Indicator for India” which analysed consumer spending data from 2011-12 to 2023-24.
Cash Usage Indicator for India. The views are of the author and not necessarily of the central bank. “ CUI is a quarterly indicator and can facilitate currency management” the author said.
The CUI or the share of cash usage in the private final consumption expenditure, which ranged from 81 to 86 percent in January-March 2021 is down to 52 to 60 percent by January-March 2024.
Significantly
digital payments
platforms particularly the United Payments Interface or
UPI
was launched commercially during demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in 2016 . But the usage attained scale and got a big boost only after the COVID-19 induced nation-wide lockdown in 2020.
Live Events
The study analysed various relevant data for consumer spending through cash and digital modes and noted that average ticket size of UPI transaction was at Rs 3872 in 2016-17 when UPI was launched and stood at Rs 1525 in Rs 2023-24. At the same time, cash is used for low-value purchases.
The currency with the public (CWP) to GDP ratio which had peaked to 13.9 percent of GDP in 2020-21 , post demonetisaton of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in 2016 is down at 11.5 percent of GDP in 2023-24. The share of UPI in person to merchant (P2M) transactions increased from 33 percent in 2020-21 to 69 percent in 2023-24 in value terms and from 51 percent to 87 percent in volume terms.
Therefore, the decline in the average size of
UPI transactions
, the increase in the share of P2M in UPI (in volume and value) and the moderation in the ratio of CWP to GDP in 2023-24 from its pre-pandemic level suggest substitution of cash with UPI for small value transactions.

mix is primarily made of sugar, not milk. Consequently, it will attract an 18%
Goods and Services Tax
(GST) rate, ToI reported.
The decision came following an application by VRB Consumer Products, a private company, seeking clarity on the classification of its ‘Vanilla Mix’. This mix is sold to buyers who produce soft serve ice cream using specialized machines. The company argued that the mix should be classified as a
milk product
under Heading 0404, which includes products with natural milk constituents, thus qualifying for a lower GST rate of 5%.
However, the AAR found that the mix's main ingredient is sugar (61.2%), with
milk solids
making up only 34%. The ruling stated, “On account of a higher percentage of sugar 61 percent in the final product, the advance ruling authority concluded that ‘milk solids are added to sugar’ and not that ‘sugar is added to milk solids’.”
Harpreet Singh, Partner, Indirect Tax, at Deloitte-India, explained that the ruling rejected the argument to classify the product as a milk product because it comprises several ingredients, each playing a crucial role.
This ruling adds to previous GST classification disputes involving milk-based products. For example, lassi, a fermented milk product, was previously exempted from GST, whereas flavored milk was subjected to a 12% GST.

Besides, payments against court decree would be included as well as cases where the finance ministry has specifically advised moving of the supplementary demand in the winter session, it said.
""While processing proposals for
supplementary grants
, the grant controlling authority must invariably identify savings within the grant so that the infructuous or inflated supplementary demands are weeded out and the eventuality of surrender after obtaining supplementary grant is avoided,"" it said.
The
Budget 2025-26
is likely to be presented on February 1.
Previously, when the Budget was presented at the end of February, the three-stage Parliament approval process used to get completed sometime in mid-May, weeks ahead of the onset of monsoon.
This meant government departments would start spending on projects only from August-end or September, after the monsoon season ended.

Inter-state disparity in terms of revenue receipt remains huge: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/inter-state-disparity-in-terms-of-revenue-receipt-remains-huge-report/articleshow/114411113.cms,21-10-2024,"New Delhi: The
revenue disparity
among
Indian states
continues to be significant, while some states have shown
revenue growth
in
FY25
but others have reported a revenue contraction, highlighted a report by
National Stock Exchange
.
The report said ""Inter-state disparity in terms of revenue receipts remains huge"". It noted that while the central government has budgeted a 14.7 per cent growth in revenue receipts, many states have set more modest targets.
""In FY25BE, while the Centre budgeted 14.7 per cent growth in revenue receipts, most states have budgeted a lower growth except Telangana, Karnataka, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh"" the report added.
The report highlighted that the states like Telangana, Karnataka, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh have projected higher growth in revenue receipts.
On the other hand, several states, particularly in the eastern and northern regions of India, are showing signs of slower revenue growth. States like Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Assam, and Mizoram have either budgeted a contraction or minimal growth in their revenue receipts when compared to the revised estimates of FY24.

""Thus, the moderation in revenue receipts is a likelihood of moderating growth in FY25"" the report said.
Despite these variations, India's overall revenue to GDP ratio is still lower than that of most other emerging markets.
However, on a positive note, the revenue collection performance of states has improved over the years. For FY25, the revenue receipts to Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) ratio for a sample group of states has risen to 15.2 per cent, up from an average of 14.8 per cent over the past 12 years.
This improvement, while modest, reflects better revenue management and collection efforts by states. However, the wide gap between states highlights the ongoing challenge of addressing inter-state disparities and ensuring more balanced growth across the country.
States with weaker fiscal growth will need to focus on reforms and policies that can help boost their revenue generation to avoid falling further behind.

"Grant-in-aid, tax devolution from Centre to States will moderate at 4.5% from 15.3% last fiscal: NSE",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/grant-in-aid-tax-devolution-from-centre-to-states-will-moderate-at-4-5-from-15-3-last-fiscal-nse/articleshow/114389712.cms,20-10-2024,"New Delhi: State governments across India are expected to face tighter finances in FY25, as grants-in-aid from the Centre are projected to decline by 6.3 per cent, highlighted a report by
NSE
.
The report noted that this is a significant change compared to the 13.9 per cent growth in these grants seen in FY24. This drop in grants, which are a crucial part of non-tax revenues for many states, could place financial pressure on those heavily dependent on central support.
""The states have budgeted grants-in-aid from the Centre to drop by 6.3 per cent in FY25BE as against a growth of 13.9 per cent in FY24RE"" the report said.
The reduction in grants is particularly concerning for states that rely heavily on this source of income. States in eastern and northeastern regions--such as Meghalaya, Mizoram, Himachal Pradesh, and Assam--are among the most affected.
The report highlighted that these states receive a significant portion of their revenue from grants-in-aid, with such grants constituting between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of their total revenue receipts.
Live Events
In FY25, these states are expected to see a 26 per cent decline in grants from the Centre, which could severely impact their financial health.
""This is particularly true for eastern and northeastern states (Meghalaya, Mizoram, Himachal Pradesh, Assam) who have about 25 per cent to 40 per cent of their revenue receipts coming from the grants-in-aid from the Centre"" the report added.
Alongside the drop in grants, the growth in devolution, which refers to the transfer of taxes from the Centre to the states, is also expected to slow.
Devolution is set to rise by just 11 per cent in FY25, down from 16.2 per cent in FY24. The report said ""Further, growth in devolution is also expected to moderate to 11 per cent in FY25BE from 16.2 per cent in the previous year (FY24RE), translating into a modest 4.5 per cent growth in overall transfers from the Centre (devolution+ grants-in-aid) vs. 15.3 per cent in FY24RE"".
Overall, the combined transfers from the Centre, which include both devolution and grants-in-aid, are expected to grow by a modest 4.5 per cent, a sharp drop from the 15.3 per cent increase witnessed in FY24. This slowdown in central transfers could make it harder for states to balance their budgets and fund key projects.
During the pandemic in FY21, the share of grants-in-aid from the Centre in overall non-tax revenues for many states surged to 77 per cent. However, this has been declining since then and is expected to fall to 61 per cent in FY25. For states that depend on these transfers, any contraction in grants will force them to either cut spending or find alternative revenue sources, which could be a difficult task.
This overall reduction in central assistance, combined with other financial pressures, means states may need to adopt more stringent financial management strategies to ensure they can meet their expenditure needs while maintaining fiscal stability.

RBI may act against more NBFCs to check obscure lending practices: Morgan Stanley,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-may-act-gainst-more-nbfcs-to-check-obscure-lending-practices-morgan-stanley/articleshow/114343845.cms,18-10-2024,"As
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) on Thursday sought action against four Non Banking Financial Companies asking them to cease and desist from making new loan sanctions and disbursements, a report by
Morgan Stanley
suggests more lending companies might face similar scrutiny.
The report noted that
lending rates
at
Asirvad Microfinance
, one of the impacted
NBFCs
, are not significantly different from other lenders, based on data provided by MFIN, an industry body for microfinance lenders.
The report observes and asks whether lending rates alone were the cause for concern by RBI against specified NBFCs or whether broader issues are at play.
""Based on an observation of lending rates data collated and presented by MFIN (industry body for microfinance lenders), we note that Asirvad Microfinance's lending rates are not very different from other lenders"" said the report.

RBI today took decisive action against four non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), namely Asirvad Microfinance,

These companies, including two
microfinance institutions
(MFIs), have been directed to halt new loan approvals and disbursements starting from the close of business on October 21, 2024. This move is part of the RBI's effort to enforce strict regulatory compliance among lenders.
The Morgan Stanley report observes that more regulatory action might follow in the sector. Although, it clarifies and believes that the RBI's intention is not to shut down new lending by microfinance institutions and NBFCs entirely.
It says a sharp rise in credit costs was observed at Asirvad, which was also seen at other companies in the sector.

""This could mean that either lending rates, in isolation, were not the issue at Asirvad, or there is likely more action to follow across lenders. We don't think RBI's intent would be to shut down new lending to the sector"" the report said.
RBI's restrictions will stay in place until these NBFCs show that they have fully aligned their practices with regulatory guidelines.
The central bank's move is seen as a signal that it is closely monitoring the sector to ensure healthy lending practices and protect borrowers from unfair treatment.
Earlier the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das has cautioned Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) to check giving incentives and fixed targets for granting loans to their employees.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, while announcing the October monetary policy emphasized that such practices could negatively impact customer interests and lead to an unhealthy work culture.
""The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring these areas and will not hesitate to take appropriate actions if necessary. Self-correction by NBFCs would, however, be the desired option."" Said RBI Governor
RBI Governor expressed concern that these practices could create a high-pressure work environment, which may result in poor customer service. (ANI)

India Inc.’s spending splurge may not trickle down,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/view-india-inc-s-spending-splurge-may-not-trickle-down/articleshow/114298817.cms,17-10-2024,"The carnival of capital expenditure that was awaiting Narendra Modi’s return to power in
India
seems to have been delayed. That’s partly because the prime minister’s narrow election win doesn’t augur well for economic reforms. Also, interest rates are high, fiscal policy tight and local firms are worried about price competition from Chinese rivals facing weak sales at home. Large Indian companies, however, are still drawing up ambitious plans, even though they will need debt — lots of it — to decisively move away from a decade-long investment drought that only ended with a post-pandemic boom. That surge is now exhausted. And tiny enterprises, which create nonfarm jobs at the vast bottom of the pyramid, look stretched. Can a handful of titans lift all boats?
S&P Global Ratings says Indian conglomerates are poised to invest $800 billion over the next 10 years, almost triple the past decade’s level. The bulk of it will go to existing businesses, where family-controlled enterprises led by Kumar Mangalam Birla, Anand Mahindra, Rajiv Bajaj, Pawan Munjal, as well as the Chennai-based
Murugappa Group
and
ITC Ltd.
, the erstwhile Imperial Tobacco Co., will participate.
They are the more cautious spenders.
About 40% of the investment, however, will be in new areas like green hydrogen, clean energy, aviation, semiconductors, electric vehicles and data centers, S&P says. Most will come from bolder players: the
Tata Group
, Gautam Adani, Mukesh Ambani,
Sajjan Jindal of JSW
and Anil Agarwal’s
Vedanta
. “The opportunity is huge,” S&P analysts Neel Gopalakrishnan and Cheng Jia Ong wrote in a report this week. “But this also presents risk — execution risk, and the risk of borrowing heavily on technology with unproven commercial payoff.”

The past decade was dominated by Ambani’s aggression.
Reliance Industries Ltd.
, India’s most valuable private-sector firm, ended up investing more than 25 times its 2014 Ebitda. The coming 10 years could well belong to Adani, Asia’s second-richest tycoon behind Ambani. The rating firm’s analysts estimate that Modi’s friend from his home state of Gujarat will spend more than 20 times his group’s 2024 Ebitda between now and 2034. JSW, Vedanta and
Tata
will also bet a large multiple of their current profit — more than they did in the 2014-2024 period. Ambani might pace things a little, though he would still spend big in absolute terms.
How can India Inc. afford the outlay? Carving up telecom, media, cement, aviation, energy and transport infrastructure among just two or three behemoths will be one way. It will give the conglomerates greater pricing power over everything from people’s phone and power bills to flight tickets and building-material costs in a market of 1.4 billion consumers. Higher profits in old industries will embolden the tycoons to raise debt for their new undertakings. As for equity, they will find plenty of foreign partners willing to shoulder the risk. Besides, markets will likely gobble up shares in Adani’s airport unit and Ambani’s telecom and retail ventures.
However, risk-taking doesn’t occur in a political-economy vacuum. Although it looks like Modi’s coalition government will compete its third five-year term, any losses in crucial state elections — two of which were announced this week — could further weaken the leader’s grip. An abrupt shift in power to more left-leaning parties could lead to a less tight-fisted fiscal strategy, which could spook financial investors and raise India’s cost of capital. But the bigger risk to conglomerates is the current administration’s very liberal policy support to them. It could dry up just when they are in the middle of an investment cycle. If politicians force local industries to become more competitive, pricing power will ebb.
On the economic front, the worry is jobless growth and anemic consumer demand, particularly in villages. Between 2005 and 2018, as many as 66 million people came out of agriculture, which is typically what happens when surplus farmhands in any developing economy chase better jobs in cities. But Covid-19 has sent a bigger number of workers — 68 million — back to the farm.
Reversal of a decade’s worth of progress has consequences. The pandemic is long over, but 800 million Indians are still on state-funded free food grains. The central bank is wary about the rapid growth in consumer loans. Even many micro enterprises are now overly leveraged.
India Ratings
, a unit of Fitch, recently drew attention to early signs of stress in finance companies’ unsecured business loans to tiny businesses at interest rates of 25% or higher. With the post-pandemic bump in demand plateauing, higher costs and rising competition “have started to bite into the margins of micro enterprises,” the firm’s analysts wrote in a recent report.
If this year’s abundant rainfall tames food inflation, the central bank would have the scope to cut rates more deeply than the half percentage point some analysts currently expect. It’s also possible that multinationals will bring new technologies and capital to India as the West drifts further apart from China. Forays into new industries like green hydrogen might pay off early. Most importantly, there could be a new cycle of housing demand, which according to analysts at Axis Capital in Mumbai, was the biggest component of the 2012-2021 investment slowdown.
Right now, though, the bull case is perched on lofty equity valuations that may struggle to hold up if corporate profit disappoints, as Ambani’s flagship Reliance Industries’ earnings did this week. While the world is fixated on China’s slowdown, India’s investment revival will also matter for global growth. The top end of the skilled workforce will undoubtedly benefit from more capital. But will the spending on machines, factories, warehouses and stores trickle down to lower rungs of the country’s 600 million workforce, boosting jobs, wages and consumer demand? That’s where the road ahead looks treacherous.

GoM on GST compensation cess holds first meeting: No new levies until future is decided,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gom-on-gst-compensation-cess-holds-first-meeting-no-new-levies-until-future-is-decided/articleshow/114293058.cms,17-10-2024,"The 10-member
group of ministers
(GoM) on
compensation cess
decided in its first meeting on Wednesday not to extend the levy to any new item until a final call on its future is taken, said people with knowledge of the matter.
The panel, headed by Union minister of state for finance
Pankaj Chaudhary
, is tasked with deciding on the future of compensation cess levied on
sin goods
under the
goods and services tax
(GST) regime beyond March 2026.
The GoM will meet again in November second week to hear members' views on the future of the cess. ""It was just an introductory meeting with general discussion, and a detailed agenda will be set and discussed in the next meeting,"" said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.
Compensation cess, imposed on products in the 28% slab, was introduced after the 2017 rollout of GST to cover any shortfall in states' revenue due to the switchover to the new regime for five years.
The panel will consider whether the ongoing compensation cess should continue after repayment of the back-to-back loans taken to assist the states or whether it should be subsumed into the highest
tax bracket
. It will also decide on what to do with the
excessive cess collections
expected after the repayment of these loans and their associated interest.

GST Compensation Cess Future: Group of Ministers proposes merger with taxes,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-compensation-cess-future-group-of-ministers-proposes-merger-with-taxes/articleshow/114281454.cms,16-10-2024,"The group of ministers (GoM) on

Minister of State for Finance
Pankaj Chaudhary, on Wednesday discussed merger of compensation cess into GST. States suggested that during the transition of cess, once it is decided to merge with taxes no new goods should be added to the list of luxury, sin and
demerit goods
.
States were of the view that since the compensation cess ends in March 2026, the only way to restructure it is to merge the levy with the taxes and bring about separate
tax rates
for the items on which cess is levied currently.
""GST compensation cess is coming to an end. A discussion needed to be done on what will be the future of the cess. Every state has given their views. This was the first meeting,"" Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said.
Should it continue as cess or be converted to tax and whether there would be changes in luxury, demerit and
sin goods
items, Chaudhary said, ""Discussion is going on"".
The next meeting of the GoM on compensation cess is in the second week of November.

End of GST compensation cess may not be blessing for 'sin taxed'
Sources said all states have suggested
merger of taxes
under GST, because compensation cess has expired.
""But no new goods will be added. Compensation period has ended and if it has to be brought under GST then it has to be restructured and brought in as taxes,"" sources said.
The Group of Ministers (GoM), which includes members from Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, will submit its report to the
GST Council
by December 31.
In the GST regime, compensation cess at varied rates is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods over and above the 28 per cent tax. The proceeds from the cess, which was originally planned for five years after GST roll-out or till June 2022, was used to compensate states for revenue loss incurred by them post the introduction of GST.
In 2022, the Council decided to extend the levy till March 2026 to repay the interest and the principle amount of the Rs 2.69 lakh crore worth loan taken in the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years to make good states' revenue loss during Covid years.
With just one-and-a-half year remaining for the cess to end, the GST Council in its 54th meeting on September 9 decided to set up a GoM to decide the future course of the cess.

"FY25 gold bond float target may be cut again to below ₹10,000 cr",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/fy25-gold-bond-float-target-may-be-cut-again-to-below-10000-cr/articleshow/114097059.cms,10-10-2024,"New Delhi: The government will likely cut its
gold bond float target
for 2024-25 drastically again to less than ₹10,000 crore, as it finds current market conditions unfavourable and the mopup of funds through this route costly, a senior finance ministry official said.
The government had in July slashed this target to ₹18,500 crore from the interim budget level of ₹29,638 crore, ET had reported on July 26.
""It will be cut again, possibly to well below ₹10,000 crore. The precise size of the issuance would be finalised in due course,"" the official told ET.
""There is also this question as to whether such bond issuances are really required at the moment, given the high cost of borrowing through such instruments,"" he added.
The government had garnered a record ₹28,240 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24 through gold bonds. While finalising its
market borrowing
calendar for the second half of this fiscal, the finance ministry last month decided to assess market conditions and requirements afresh before floating such bonds this fiscal.
Live Events
A senior official had then said that it's not a social security scheme that the government must support it constantly.
Holders of such bonds, denominated in grams of gold, get a 2.5% annual interest and an exemption from
capital gains tax
upon maturity, on top of any appreciation in the precious metal rates.
While these benefits have made the gold bonds attractive for investors in recent years, they have also pushed up the government's cost of fund mop-up through such papers above its usual market borrowing rates, the official said. This has prompted the government to undertake a cost-benefit analysis.
Gold prices
have shot up by 30% over the past one year and almost 5% in the last one month to Rs 74,834 per 10 grams (24 karat), according to the
India Bullion and Jewellers Association
data.
The spike is caused by investors' flight to safe-haven assets like gold in the wake of the persistent
geopolitical tensions
, especially after the
Israel-Hamas war
, and sticky global inflation, experts said. The sovereign
gold bond scheme
is targeted at those looking at gold as an investment-helping them buy ""paper gold"" instead of physical gold.
The government had launched the scheme in late 2015 to discourage physical purchases of the precious metal and trim imports to reduce their debilitating effect on the current account deficit.

volumes of standard assets touched Rs. 60,000 crore in the September quarter, domestic rating agency
ICRA
has estimated.
Securitisation
grew 36% sequentially and 31% on year basis.
“The sharp increase in the quarterly volumes has been fuelled by large
private sector banks
selling down their portfolio to improve their credit-to-deposit ratio, given the relatively lower pace of deposit accretion being witnessed,” ICRA noted.
The securitisation volumes for the first half of the current fiscal is estimated to have crossed Rs 1.04 lakh crore, reflecting a modest year-on-year growth of 2% as the volumes had been relatively muted in the June quarter.
ICRA believes that the market is on track to reach Rs 2.1 lakh crore in the current fiscal compared to Rs 1.9 trillion in fiscal year 2024.

HDFC Bank originates India’s largest securitisation transaction
“The securitisation volumes in the current year would benefit from participation of private sector banks as originators, given the challenges being faced to raise deposits while the
credit demand
remains strong,” said Abhishek Dafria, Senior Vice President and Group Head, Structured Finance Ratings, at ICRA. “In Q2 FY2025, about 35% of the assets securitised had been originated by private sector banks, which is a significant boost, compared to previous years when banks used to be almost non-existent in this market as originators.”
The non-banking financial companies (
NBFCs
) also continue to raise funding through securitisation as it diversifies their borrowing liabilities and improves the asset-liability mismatch.
Securitisation is largely being done through the issuance of pass-through certificates (PTCs) in the current fiscal while the proportion of direct sell-down or direct assignments (DA) has reduced.
Vehicle loan receivables continue to form the highest market share among the various asset classes being securitised, given the presence of large-size NBFCs in this space in the market as well as the moderate tenure of the product, ICRA said.

HDFC Bank continues aggressive deposit accretion, adds Rs 1.2 lakh crore in September quarter
On the other hand,
mortgage-backed loans
such as home loans or loan against property continue to face challenges in the PTC market, given their longer tenure as well as interest rate risks, which act as a deterrent for investors.
Volumes of personal loan securitisation remain healthy as certain banks are selling down these loans to maintain their desired mix of unsecured loans in the overall portfolio, whereas investors benefit from a higher yield on these products.
“The securitisation market has been widening over the past few years with the emergence of new originators as well as investors, and this development has continued in the current fiscal as well,” said Dafria. “There is a wide divergence among the asset classes too though the development of the retail mortgage-backed securitisation market should remain a key priority of the industry.”
ICRA expects microfinance loan securitisation to witness some momentary challenges due to the recent spike in delinquency levels seen in this asset class, but the introduction of guardrails by the industry body to avoid over leveraging of the borrowers would help regain confidence in the second half.

Financial stability could weigh more than macro signals,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/financial-stability-could-weigh-more-than-macro-signals/articleshow/113992355.cms,06-10-2024,"Unlike most central banks that move in conventional cycles-either tightening or easing-the
Reserve Bank of India
need not, thanks to its role as a full-service central bank.
When the role of the monetary policy maker is also that of a financial markets regulator and supervisor of the players in it, balacing the interests of consumers as well, interest rate and liquidity decisions are often swayed by the priority of maintaining
financial stability
.
As the
Monetary Policy Committee
meets with three new external members, the more dominant question is not interest rate reduction, or monetary stance, but liquidity and deposits crunch that banks face.
The consensus is the MPC will go for a status quo on interest rate, and the possibility of shifting its stance to 'neutral' from 'withdrawal of accommodation.'
It's a triple challenge-uncertainty caused by
geopolitical developments
in the Middle East, the farm output impact on inflation trajectory, and the softening of growth impulses. Which one will weigh the most?
Live Events
While this meeting is set amidst the reduction of policy rates by the Federal Reserve by 50 basis points, the RBI's declared stance is that it goes by the mantra 'what is good and needed for the Indian economy' rather than to be dictated by actions elsewhere. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
Outcome of geopolitical conflicts is what even those driving it don't have control over. The Russia-Ukraine conflict that started in 2022 shows what's probably in store in the Middle East flare-up involving Israel and the Arabs. The first-level reaction-oil prices shot up more than 8% in a week. Be comforted that RBI's assumption of crude oil prices for its forecast is $85 a barrel compared to Friday's $78 a barrel.
Inflation, mostly driven by food prices which has 46% weighting in the Consumer Price Index, is more uncertain than geopolitics given its exposure to shocks from truckers' strike to excess rainfall in a region. But the bountiful monsoon has given hopes of it softening and taking it towards the 4% target, from an average of 6.6% for five and a half years. The comfort factor here is that core inflation-stripping out food and fuel-has averaged 3.5% this year reflecting the success of inflation targeting.
India's flexible inflation targeting mandates maintaining 'price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth.' That brings in the latest macroeconomic numbers which though robust are showing signs of slowing.
""The latest GDP, PMI Manufacturing, motor sales, cement production, bank credit, corporate tax collections, GST revenue growth and goods exports, have been softer than before,"" says Pranjul Bhandari, economist at HSBC.
While these may be core of the MPC debate, the financial system is hobbled by deposits, and liquidity which are more powerful than the policy repo rate, the rate at which RBI lends banks. It is at 6.5%.
Core liquidity which measures the system, plus the government cash balances is at ₹4.5 lakh crore, up from ₹2.3 lakh crore in March. Expectation of a change in stance and flows due to JP Morgan Index inclusion has already pushed down yields by about 30 basis points.
But the deposit scenario is not half encouraging where the financial stability plays a role as well. After a clampdown on unsecured loans and lending to non-banking finance companies, the regulator is still agitated. The latest diktat on gold loans is an example.
Pure macroeconomic conditions-inflation and growth outlook-may present a case for a reduction in
interest rates
.
""The RBI doesn't gain from waiting any longer,"" says HSBC's Bhandari.
If financial stability weighs more than the macroeconomy, the choice may be to wait.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman calls for faster cap investment rollout by states,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-calls-for-faster-cap-investment-rollout-by-states/articleshow/113949179.cms,05-10-2024,"Finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
on Friday asked expenditure secretary Manoj Govil to coordinate with states to expedite the submission and approval of
project proposals
and ensure that they undertake capital investments in a timely and efficient manner.
Under the scheme for special assistance to states for
capital investment
, their projects worth only ₹50,069 crore have been approved in the first half of 2024-25, against the budgetary allocation of ₹1.5 lakh crore for the entire year, the
finance ministry
said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).
Under this scheme, the Centre extends 50-year loans to states at zero interest to boost their durable assets creation. States are required to undertake stipulated reform measures to obtain a part of the
capex loans
that are conditional in nature, although a large part remains untied.
In a meeting to review the scheme's progress, Sitharaman also directed senior finance ministry officials to nudge states to carry out the required reforms and use up the entire capex allocation.
This was a part of her series of meetings lined up to review the capital spending and resultant asset creation across ministries. Economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth and other senior finance ministry officials also attended the meeting.

BofA sees India’s forex pile reaching $745 billion in March 2026,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/bofa-sees-indias-forex-pile-reaching-745-billion-in-march-2026/articleshow/113936624.cms,04-10-2024,"India’s
foreign-exchange reserves
will likely rise to $745 billion by March 2026, giving the central bank more potential firepower to influence the rupee, according to
Bank of America
.
The monetary authority “seems relaxed about holding larger forex reserves, owing to its desire to build buffers against contingent external risks,”
BofA
analysts Rahul Bajoria and Abhay Gupta wrote in a note Friday. India’s reserves adequacy appears strong compared with other major emerging markets, but not necessarily excessive, they said.
India has the world’s fourth-biggest foreign reserves at $692 billion as rising overseas inflows into the nation’s stocks and bonds have helped the
Reserve Bank of India
boost its stockpile to a record high. The amount provides stability to the rupee against external shocks, with the RBI using its reserves to limit extreme swings in the currency hovering near a record low.
Bloomberg
The growth in FX reserves will be driven by a
balance-of-payments surplus
, owing to a smaller
current-account deficit
, the analysts wrote.

RBI Governor
Shaktikanta Das has repeatedly stressed the need to build a forex buffer to act as a shield during periods of market volatility.
“USD/INR‘s wider daily ranges recently have created some wiggle-room for limited INR appreciation, and higher volatility compared to over the past year,” Bajoria and Gupta wrote. “However, the RBI can simultaneously attain its multiple objectives of building a larger reserves buffer and maintaining currency competitiveness, while allowing limited bilateral INR appreciation.”

Upcoming decades to be a 'defining era' for Indians to live in: FM,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/upcoming-decades-to-be-a-defining-era-for-indians-to-live-in-fm/articleshow/113928491.cms,04-10-2024,"Finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
on Friday said the coming decades will see the steepest rise in
living standards
for the common man, making it “a period-defining era for an Indian to live in”.
While the country took 75 years to achieve a
per capita income
of $2,730, as per the International Monetary Fund projection, it will take only five years to add another $2,000, she said.
The “Indian era”, the minister said, will be shaped by its predominantly youthful population, who will provide a large base for total factor productivity improvements, savings and investment, on top of being a key and sustained driver of domestic consumption. Youths below the age of 24 account for 43% of population.
The financial system is now well capitalised to fuel productive credit growth and remains nimble to the expanding needs of a developing
India
, as it widened its scale and scope of financial inclusion. The country’s innovation prowess is maturing across sectors.
Sitharaman was speaking at the inaugural session of the
Kautilya Economic Conclave
in the national capital, organised by the finance ministry.
Live Events
“India also finds itself amidst a global geopolitical re-positioning. This re-positioning can act as a structural force to India’s advantage by creating robust supply chains with countries with strategic congruence,” Sitharaman said.
“India benefits from the new international order, which is reshaping better to reflect the power distribution of today’s world,” she added.
Inequality has been declining, as reflected in the
Gini coefficient
for both rural and urban India and would improve further, she said, “as the effects of the last ten years of economic and structural reforms manifest more thoroughly in the data in the coming years” with the Covid shocks fading away.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast India will remain the world’s fastest-growing major economy in the current
fiscal year
and the next, with rates of expansion touching 7% and 6.5%, respectively, more than double the global averages.
Growth in a tougher environment
India’s growth over the coming decades will take place in a much more different and tougher global environment, Sitharaman said. “In the early 2000s, emerging markets like China grew relatively more easily due to a favourable global trade and investment climate,” she said. This poses a potential challenge (and an opportunity) for India.
Against this back drop, India must develop its domestic capacity to develop sustainably, while simultaneously pushing for diplomacy and cooperation, as it did during its G20 Presidency last year, she said.
India, accounting for 18% of the global population, seeks to double its per capita income in a matter of a few years, “in a fragmented and fractured world where several persistent conflicts may worsen, posing a threat to global peace that is the bedrock of prosperity”, she said.
The country’s development journey will also have to “contend with the twin challenges of dealing with the legacy emissions of the developed world and managing India’s energy transition”.
This balancing act “requires a whole-of-government approach and contextualised solutions unique to India”. “Moreover, India’s energy demand and energy use practices have something to offer the world, such as the food-to-feed balance,” Sitharaman said.
The minister also underscored the disruption potential new technologies and their lasting impact on labour, including workers at all levels.
“The resulting economic and social impacts may be more profound than the world has experienced. While this is a global phenomenon, it is more acute for India, given its vast young population and the need to create livelihoods for millions,” the minister said.
“It is also a question of the kind of society we wish to create that people gathered here and outside have to reflect upon,” she added.
Fiscal discipline
and reforms
Sitharaman reiterated the pledge to prudent spending, saying the “commitment to fiscal discipline will not only help keep bond yields in check but will translate to lower economy-wide borrowing costs”. The fiscal deficit is estimated to decline from 5.6% of GDP in FY24 to 4.9% this financial year.
“Additionally, a larger proportion of fiscal deficit is now accounted for by capital outlays, indicating an increasingly investment-oriented deficit financing,” she said.
Capital spending is estimated to touch a record Rs 11.1 lakh crore in the current fiscal.
The decline in commodity prices has facilitated the lowering of the budgeted allocation for subsidies on fertiliser and fuel, she said.
“The role of the government lies in unleashing the structural drivers of growth using effective governance through Jan Bhagidari (people’s participation), with sound economic policies and strategic planning forming the cornerstone of the growth process,” she said.
“To ensure policy continuity, the bedrock of sustained growth, our government has initiated and sustained reforms across infrastructure, banking, trade policy, investment, and ease of doing business,” she added.

India to take five years to almost achieve an income feat that earlier took 75 years: Nirmala Sitharaman,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-to-take-five-years-to-almost-achieve-an-income-feat-that-earlier-took-75-years-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/113926218.cms,04-10-2024,"Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
expressed optimism about India's economic growth, projecting that
per capita income
will increase by $2,000 over the next five years.
During her address at the
Kautilya Economic Conclave
, she highlighted that it took 75 years to reach a per capita income of $2,730, but the next significant jump is expected to occur much more rapidly.
Sitharaman emphasised the role of consumption, which comprises over 60% of India's GDP, pointing out that nearly 43% of the population is under 24 years old. This demographic advantage is seen as a driver for organic consumption growth.
She also discussed the strength of India's financial system, claiming it is now comparable to global markets, and underscored the importance of nurturing the youth to ensure they are both mentally and physically strong. Additionally, she drew a comparison to China's growth, noting that the latter benefitted from a favorable global trade and investment climate.
Sitharaman's message was one of confidence in India's capacity for sustained economic growth, fueled by innovation and a robust financial framework.

Earlier, the finance minister had stated that India stands out globally in terms of economic growth and will continue to do so for the next few years.
""We are much better off than many other countries, even if they are advanced countries. Today they are struggling to grow,"" Sitharaman had said. ""We are standing out as an economy which is growing at the fastest rate in the last few years, this year and the next few years also, for which we can make predictions.""
The economy grew at 8.2% in 2023-24. The Economic Survey 2023-24, tabled in Parliament in July, projected the economy to clock 6.5-7% growth this fiscal year.

RBI's overseas reserves deployment income up 52% in June quarter,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-overseas-reserves-deployment-income-up-52-percent-in-june-quarter/articleshow/113914729.cms,03-10-2024,"Gayatri NayakThe
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) earned 52% more by deploying its reserves overseas in the June quarter thanks largely due to higher returns on
treasury bonds
and interest on deposits parked with other central banks. But rate cuts by the
US Federal Reserve
going ahead could trim these gains.
Income from reserve assets amounted to $4.1 billion during the June quarter, compared with $2.7 billion in the same period a year ago, showed the latest figures on the balance of payments.
""It could reflect higher returns on bonds (coupon payments) and deposits as the global rate cut cycle has just begun. The RBI’s forex reserves rose by $5.2bn in Q1FY25 (excluding revaluation change). The combination would support income on reserve assets,"" said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist, IDFC Bank.
The central bank deploys its
foreign currency assets
mostly in bonds issued by top rate sovereigns- predominantly US government bonds and also as deposits with foreign central banks and multilateral agencies . A small portion is also parked with foreign commercial banks.
The RBI is also likely to have earned higher commission on dollar sales.
Live Events
""Another possibility is the rise in gross dollar sales in Q1FY25 worth $49.1bn v/s $4bn in Q1FY24. The change in accounting norms a few years ago to historical cost accounting has supported profits from
foreign exchange transactions
,” said Sengupta. “As per our estimate the historical cost of dollar purchases is tracking at 65.8, which remains significantly lower than current USD/INR spot rate.""
From the central bank's income and balance sheet perspective and the possibility of higher dividend payout, a lot of other factors are at play. One of them would be valuation gains and losses on various assets.
""The valuation change in FX reserve assets in June quarter was significantly higher than the same period last year primarily driven by higher
gold prices
which more than offset the valuation losses due to higher UST yields,"" said an economist with a foreign bank. ""The trend on valuation changes going forth would depend on gold prices as further downtick in UST yields is likely to be limited.”
""The front loaded impact is positive, as rates go down and gold prices go up. In the medium term though it can again lower returns for RBI on its foreign assets, so there is some trade off."" Rahul Bajoria, Head of India and ASEAN
Economic Research
, BofA Securities India
Going ahead, given that the Fed's rate cut cycle has just begun, interest income on reserves holding is likely to be substantial this fiscal.
""Given that the rate cut cycle globally has just started, the income from coupon payments on bond holdings and interest on deposits will remain substantial in FY25. The historical cost accounting will continue to support profits on foreign exchange transactions,"" said Sengupta.

GST Rate Cut: Tax on several mass-use products may be reduced,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-rate-cut-tax-on-several-mass-use-products-may-be-reduced/articleshow/113907071.cms,03-10-2024,"A ministerial panel on
GST rate rationalisation
is considering lowering GST rates on several mass-use items, including medicines and tractors, to 5%. However, the tax on products like cement is likely to remain unchanged. Tractors currently face a 12% or 28% GST, depending on their classification.
To offset the potential revenue loss from reducing GST on tractors, the panel is discussing increasing GST on high-end electric vehicles (EVs) that cost over Rs 40 lakh and are imported, from the current 5%.
A reduction in GST on health and term insurance is expected soon. Health insurance could see a reduction from 18% to 12%, while term insurance might be taxed at 5%. There were suggestions to place term insurance in the 'nil' rate segment. However, a zero rate would prevent input tax credit for suppliers, making it less attractive. Hence, 5% GST on term insurance seems more likely.
The panel, led by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, might not reduce the number of GST slabs from four to three but is considering moving several items from the 12% bracket to either 5% or 18%. This move is part of a gradual transition to a three-rate structure.
The discussions will be more detailed by the end of the month. The panel on insurance, also headed by Chaudhary, is set to meet on October 19, followed by the rate rationalisation panel's meeting on October 20. By then, the fitment committee will have worked out the details.

Some state finance ministers within the group of ministers (GoM) support a three-rate structure, while others, like those from Kerala, Karnataka, and West Bengal, prefer the current system. Kerala's Finance Minister K N Balagopal is particularly hesitant, possibly due to the state's poor financial situation.
Revenue loss is a key concern for states. Lowering GST on medicines from 12% to 5% could result in an over Rs 11,000 crore shortfall for both the Centre and the states.
Health insurance GST
contributes over Rs 8,000 crore. The 18% and 28% GST slabs generate the most revenue, with the latter accounting for around 72-73% of collections.
Concerns about cartelisation in certain industries, like cement, are influencing decisions. Cement's GST rate is likely to remain at 28% due to past issues with price fixing. Revenue considerations will also affect the taxation of items like cigarettes, soft drinks, and packed snacks.

economic growth
.
September's Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections showed a 6.5% increase compared to last year. However, experts are optimistic about the upcoming months, citing the ongoing
festive season
and the government's efforts to maintain stable revenue.
The Finance Ministry reported that September’s
GST collections
were Rs 1.73 lakh crore, compared to Rs 1.62 lakh crore in September 2023.
“While the GST revenues for the month may be a little underwhelming, considering the fact these collections relate to supplies in August, which is typically the beginning of the festive season buying spree, resulting in increased revenues,” said MS Mani, Partner at Deloitte India.
Mani noted that GST revenues in the upcoming festive season will be closely monitored as an indicator of economic growth and its correlation with GDP figures. He also mentioned the government's initiatives to expedite refunds and simplify the refund process.

Mahesh Jaising, Partner and Leader of Indirect Tax at Deloitte India, described a 6.5% year-on-year growth in GST collections as healthy.

Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner at
EY India
, mentioned that growth in regions like Ladakh, Puducherry, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is contributing to the collections. “While collections for this month haven’t shown significant increases, it is anticipated that next month’s collections should see a significant increase due to the upcoming festive season,” he added.
Overall, CGST, SGST, IGST, and cess all increased year-on-year in September. So far in 2024, total GST collections have been 9.5% higher at Rs 10.9 lakh crore compared to Rs 9.9 lakh crore in the same period of 2023.

He noted that increased spending in rural areas is expected to drive this growth. ""We are on track to achieve a growth rate exceeding 7%."" Furthermore, Paras Jasrai, senior economic analyst at India Ratings and Research, indicated that economic performance in FY25 has been robust thus far, with demand drivers becoming more diverse, as evidenced by strong growth in both consumption and investment.

pegged in the Interim budget. Sitharaman also pegged the fiscal deficit target at 5.1% for the next fiscal year.
In the Budget announced in July, the government stuck to its fiscal consolidation roadmap even as coalition parties demanded more funds from the Modi government and the middle class urged for tax relief measures.
On the expenditure side, New Delhi spent about 1.79 lakh crore rupees on major subsidies such as food, fertilisers and petroleum. This was 47% of the annual aim, tad narrower than 48% of budgeted expenditure in the comparable period last year.

Government bond yields likely to soften further by end of the fiscal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/government-bond-yields-likely-to-soften-further-by-end-of-the-fiscal/articleshow/113791124.cms,29-09-2024,"Kolkata:
Government bond yields
are likely to soften further by the end of the fiscal, leading to an annualised savings of Rs 1,000-2,000 crore for the exchequer. Higher demand, especially from
foreign portfolio investors
, would help yields remain tamed, economists said, pointing to North Block’s second-half borrowing calendar published last week.
The Centre’s gross borrowings for the second half of the fiscal have been fixed at Rs 6.61 lakh crore with the borrowing target for the entire fiscal being maintained at Rs 14.01 lakh crore, the central bank said last week. About 77% of the bond issuances will be for 10 years or higher tenure.
""Given the favourable global and domestic backdrop, we expect a further downward bias in domestic yields, leading to a steepening bias in the yield curve,""
Bank of Baroda
economist Aditi Gupta said.
Bond yields have eased gradually in the first half of the fiscal, with the
10-year benchmark yield
at more than a two-and-a-half year low last week, tracking lower US treasury and soft oil prices.
""The 10-year government-security yield is expected to reduce towards 6.5% by March 2025, supported by favourable demand-supply dynamics and expected
RBI rate cut
,"" an
IDFC First Bank
report said. Demand for g-secs is bolstered by India's inclusion in the JP Morgan Emerging Market bond index, besides the usual demand from insurance, provident- and pension funds.

A whopping $24 billion overseas inflows is expected as a result of the inclusion in the JP Morgan Emerging Market index.
The softening trend in yield will further be supported by RBI's policy rate reduction towards the end of the fiscal, as anticipated by the market.
DBS Bank senior economist Radhika Rao expects a dovish policy outcome from RBI's
monetary policy committee
in October, while
IDFC First Bank
projects the rate cut cycle to begin in December, with
food inflation pressures
expected to ease.
""By March 2025, we expect a cumulative 50 basis points rate cut"", the IDFC First Bank note said.
All these factors would keep the actual interest cost for the government lower.
""Based on movement in yields, we estimate that the savings in interest costs on an annualized basis would be between Rs 1000-2000 crore,"" Bank of Baroda's Gupta said.
The annualized interest cost on the second half market borrowing would be around Rs 45,000 crore, if the government sticks to the borrowing borrowing programme, she added. This is based on present yields in the market.

"Centre to borrow Rs 6.6 lakh crore in H2, stays within FY25 Budget target",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-to-borrow-rs-6-6-lakh-crore-in-h2-stays-within-fy25-budget-target/articleshow/113713089.cms,26-09-2024,"The Centre will borrow Rs 6.61 lakh crore from the market through dated securities in the second half of this fiscal, staying with the budgetary target of Rs 14.01 lakh crore for the full year, the finance ministry said on Thursday.
It has borrowed close to Rs 7.4 lakh crore in the fiscal first half ending this month.
Experts said maintaining the borrowing target could slightly impact the
bond market
that was preparing for a cut, but would eventually prevent any flare-up in yields.
The benchmark 10-year yield ended at 6.7178% on Thursday, its lowest since February 21, 2022.
""In order to smoothen repayments of borrowing of two years of pandemic, we would make necessary adjustments in dated borrowings going forward,""
economic affairs secretary
Ajay Seth said.
Live Events
""This approach was adopted in the H2 (borrowing) calendar also,"" he added.
Of the projected borrowing, the government said it will raise Rs 20,000 crore via sovereign
green bonds
in the second half of FY25.
In the July Budget, the government had reduced the FY25 gross market borrowing target to Rs 14.01 lakh crore from Rs 15.43 lakh crore in FY24, as it went on a fiscal consolidation drive.
A sharp decline in redemptions would entail a 32% year-on-year expansion in the net borrowings to ₹6 lakh crore in the second half of the fiscal, said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at credit rating agency
ICRA
.
""Aided by the favourable outlook for revenues and a possible undershooting of the ambitious capex target, ICRA expects the Centre's
fiscal deficit
to print in line with or mildly trail the budgetary target of Rs 16.1 lakh crore or 4.9% of GDP, at the current juncture,"" she said.
The borrowing in the second half is scheduled to be over in 21 weekly tranches. The share of borrowing, including through the green bonds, under different maturities will be: 3-year (5.3%), 5-year (10.6%), 7-year (7.6%), 10-year (24.8%), 15-year (13.2%), 30-year (12.1%), 40-year (15.9%) and 50-year (10.6%).
The government also keeps the right to exercise a green-shoe option to retain an additional subscription of up to ₹2,000 crore against each of the securities indicated in the auction calendar. It will continue to carry out switching or buyback of securities to ""smoothen the redemption profile"", the finance ministry said in a statement.
Weekly borrowing through treasury bills in the third quarter of this fiscal is expected to be Rs 19,000 crore for 13 auctions, it said. There will be a weekly treasury bill issuance of Rs 7,000 crore under the 91-day category and Rs 6,000 crore each under the 182-day and 364-day brackets.
The Reserve Bank of India has fixed the Ways and Means Advances limit for the second half of FY25 at Rs 50,000 crore to help fix temporary mismatches in the government accounts.

The gross market borrowing of Rs 6.61 lakh crore shall be completed through 21 weekly auctions.
The market borrowing will be spread over 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 30, 40 and 50 year securities.

It will continue to reserve the right to exercise greenshoe option to retain an additional subscription of up to Rs 2,000 crore against each of the securities indicated in the auction notifications, it said.
Weekly borrowing through issuance of Treasury Bills in the third quarter of 2024-25 is expected to be Rs 19,000 crore for 13 weeks with issuance of Rs 7,000 crore under 91 dated treasury bills (DTBs), Rs 6,000 crore under 182 DTBs and Rs 6,000 crore under 364 DTBs.
To take care of temporary mismatches in government accounts, the Reserve Bank of
India
has fixed the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) limit for H2 of FY 2024-25 at Rs 50,000 crore.
Out of the gross market borrowing of Rs 14.01 lakh crore estimated for 2024-25, Rs 7.4 lakh crore, or 52.8 per cent, is already raised in first half (H1).
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the interim
Budget
had proposed to borrow Rs 14.13 lakh crore by issuing dated securities to meet revenue shortfall in the next financial year.
However, she reduced the gross borrowing estimate by Rs 12,000 crore in the final Budget tabled in July on account of robust revenue collection.
The gross borrowing for FY25 is lower than last year's gross borrowing estimate of Rs 15.43 lakh crore, which was the highest ever.
""The gross and net market borrowings through dated securities during 2024-25 are estimated at Rs 14.01 lakh crore and Rs 11.63 lakh crore respectively. Both will be less than that in 2023-24,” she had said.
There are signs of private investment picking up in the steel and cement sector due to massive capital expenditure by the government.
Against the estimate of Rs 10 lakh crore for 2023-24, the government has earmarked Rs 11.11 lakh crore for this year.

Tax on 100 items to be slashed? GST's rate rationalisation panel to decide next month,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-rate-rationalisation-gom-discusses-pruning-12-pc-slab-next-meeting-on-oct-20/articleshow/113693419.cms,26-09-2024,"The Group of Ministers (
GoM
) on
GST rate rationalisation
has reviewed the possibility of revising tax rates on over 100 items, aiming to reduce the burden on the
common man
, reported PTI.
West Bengal Finance Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said on Thursday that the GoM is considering lowering the
GST
on certain goods from 12% to 5%, and the next meeting is scheduled for October 20. Among the key items up for discussion are bicycles and bottled water.
During the meeting held on Wednesday, the GoM also discussed reducing tax rates on medical and pharmaceutical items currently in the 12% tax slab. Further deliberation on this matter will take place in the October meeting.
To balance potential revenue losses from these reductions, the GoM is exploring the option of increasing the GST on some goods, such as aerated water and beverages, which are currently taxed at 28%, plus cess. ""States cannot bear any reduction in GST revenue at this point of time,"" PTI quoted Bhattacharya as saying.
Currently, India has a four-tier GST structure with rates of 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. As per GST laws, tax rates on goods and services can be raised to as high as 40%. The average GST
rate
has dropped to 11.56% in 2024, below the revenue-neutral rate of 15.3%. This has triggered discussions on GST rate rationalisation.

Bhattacharya emphasized that reducing the GST on essential items, like food products, from 12% to 5% could significantly reduce prices for consumers. However, some items in the 18% slab, such as hair dryers, beauty products, and similar goods, may see an increase back to the 28% slab.
""There was no discussion on pruning the slabs. The GoM had consensus that the common man should get relief, and it also converged that if tax rates are reduced on items for common man, then it should also look at means to make up for the lost revenue,"" Bhattacharya said.
The GoM will present its recommendations to the GST Council, chaired by the Union Finance Minister, following the October 20 meeting. This council includes representatives from all states and Union Territories (UTs).
Currently, bicycles and their parts attract a 12% GST, while electric bicycles are taxed at 5%. Bhattacharya indicated that the GoM would consider reducing the GST on bicycles used by the general public.

"Health, life insurance premiums need a tax cut? GoM to meet on October 19",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/health-life-insurance-premium-needs-a-tax-cut-gom-to-meet-on-october-19/articleshow/113690829.cms,26-09-2024,"The ministerial panel to decide on lowering goods and services tax (GST) on health and life
insurance premiums
will have its first meeting on October 19, officials said. Currently, 18 per cent GST is levied on insurance premiums and there have been demands to either exempt or reduce the tax.
The
GST Council
in its meeting earlier this month decided to set up a 13-member GoM to decide on tax on health and life insurance premiums.
Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary is the convenor of the GoM.
The panel includes ministers from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana.
The GoM has been mandated to submit its report to the Council by October-end.
Live Events
A final call by the council on taxation of insurance premiums is likely to be taken in the next meeting in November, based on the GoM report.
""The GoM on GST on insurance will meet on October 19 in Delhi,"" the official said.
The terms of reference (ToR) of the panel also includes suggesting tax rate of health/medical insurance, including individual, group, family floater, and other medical insurance for various categories like senior citizens, middle class, persons with mental illness.
The ToR also include suggest tax rates on life insurance, including term insurance, life insurance with investment plans, whether individual or group and re-insurance.
Some Opposition-ruled states, including West Bengal, had demanded complete exemption of
GST on health
and life insurance premiums, while some other states were in favour of lowering the tax to 5 per cent.
Even Union Transport Minister
Nitin Gadkari
had in July written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the issue saying ""levying GST on life insurance premium amounts to levying tax on the uncertainties of life"".
In 2023-24, the Centre and states collected Rs 8,262.94 crore through GST on
health insurance
premium, while Rs 1,484.36 crore was collected on account of GST on health reinsurance premium.
Sitharaman in her reply to discussion on Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha in August had said that 75 per cent of the GST collected goes to states and the Opposition members should ask their state finance ministers to bring the proposal at the GST Council.

Aim to increase FDI inflows to $100 billion a year: DPIIT Secy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/expecting-fdi-to-increase-to-usd-100-bn/annum-in-coming-years-dpiit-secy/articleshow/113666997.cms,25-09-2024,"India aims to increase inflows of
foreign direct investment
(
FDI
) to $100 billion a year from $70-80 billion annually in line with its focus on
Make in India
, and plans no changes in the Press Note 3 which mandates prior government approval investment from its land-border sharing countries including China,
Amardeep Singh Bhatia
, secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (
DPIIT
) said Wednesday.
He also said with a higher labour availability than Vietnam and Bangladesh, India is looking to encourage labour-intensive sectors to increase use of available skill sets. Citing the example of Apple Inc's contract manufacturers such as Wistron and Foxconn bringing in their labour-intensive assembly units, he said that the DPIIT has already given its inputs to the heavy industries ministry on the proposed EV policy, though he termed it premature to comment on the changes that have been proposed. ""We are targeting much higher
investment flows
. We have about $ 70 billion to $ 80 billion which is coming in every year. But we are expecting this to increase to at least $ 100 billion a year in the years to come,"" Bhatia said on the 10th year of Make in India initiative.
The overseas inflows in the last 10 financial years (2014-24) were $667.4 billion against $304.1 billion in 2004-14. Automobiles, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals were the sectors that saw the highest FDI.
In the first quarter of this fiscal, India attracted FDI worth $ 22.49 billion as against $17.56 billion in April-June FY24. ""So I think, we are going towards a better trajectory as compared to last year... There has been a continuous effort for liberalising FDI,"" said an official.
As per the DPIIT, defence contracts worth billions of dollars were awarded to Indian companies like Tata, L&T, and
Bharat Forge
, fostering a growing ecosystem of defense manufacturing.
Live Events
On plans to extend investment attraction beyond mobiles in the electronics sector, Bhatia said that while critical technologies will continue to be on the government's radar, steps are underway to bring the larger value chain to India, like the semiconductor mission.
He also said that there are no plans at present to extend the production linked incentive (PLI) schemes beyond the 14 existing sectors and the department is working on doing away with penalties for nearly 100 amendments as part of Jan Vishwas 2 to encourage ease of doing business.
As far as PLI is concerned, at the end of June 2024, the 14 sectors covered under the scheme have seen investment realisation of ₹1.32 trillion and production of ₹10.90 trillion, generating employment for approximately 8.5 lakh individuals. ""The policy with regard to investments (from China) is laid down in the Press Note 3, so we continue with that policy. As of now, there is no change in that policy. In case if any change comes in, we will let you know,"" he said.

"India to announce October-March borrowing plan on Thursday, sources say",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-to-announce-oct-march-borrowing-plan-on-thursday-sources-say/articleshow/113657292.cms,25-09-2024,"The Indian government is likely to announce the country's
market borrowing
plan for October through March on Thursday, two sources told Reuters on Wednesday, with the market hoping for a higher supply of
longer-dated bonds
.
Of its planned 14.01 trillion rupees ($167.61 billion) in gross borrowing for the April-March financial year, the government has about 6.61 trillion rupees left for the remaining six months.
While some market participants expect a cut to the leftover amount, the majority expect the government will stick to its budgeted borrowing.
The ""market has not given up hope of a cut in the borrowing program, (but it) may be in December or January. A cut in borrowing is much more positive for the longer-end (bonds),"" said A Prasanna, head of research at
ICICI Securities
Primary Dealership.
Market participants are keen to see the government's appetite for shorter-tenor treasury bills, especially after it, in an unprecedented move, canceled two such auctions earlier this month.

But, the overwhelming demand is for more longer-dated paper, especially as yields have dropped drastically, pulling the government's borrowing costs for such paper to a near three-year low.
Nearly 40% of the government's borrowing from April to September was via longer-end papers.
Demand from Indian
insurance companies
and pensions funds pulled the yield on 50-year bonds under 7% for the first time ever earlier this month, while the 30-year bond yield has declined 50 basis points so far this year.
Insurers and pension funds invest a majority of their corpus into long-term
government bonds
to ensure adequate cash flow down the line as payouts come due, leading to unrelenting demand for such papers.
""We are present at every auction with demand of 10-15 billion rupees and, irrespective of the yields, we have to buy long papers for our product mix,"" a trader with a large pension fund said.
The trader and the two sources mentioned above declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

"Revenue over relief? Govt has room to cut customers some slack over oil prices, or choose to swell its own pocket",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/government-may-raise-excise-duty-amid-oil-price-decline-providing-relief-to-consumers/articleshow/113655689.cms,25-09-2024,"The recent sharp decline in oil prices may enable the Indian government to bolster its finances by increasing
excise duty
while offering partial relief to consumers through moderate reductions in
petrol and diesel
prices. This approach could help ease inflationary pressures, according to a report by
BofA Securities
, the investment banking division of
Bank of America
.
The report, accessed by TOI's Sanjay Dutta and Sidhartha, highlights a potential trade-off between fiscal revenues and
inflation
control.
“A fall in oil prices and the resulting reduction in import costs can be viewed as savings for India. However, it is up to the government to decide whether and how much of this savings should be passed on to the public through lower
fuel prices
,” said Rahul Bajoria in the report.
The report estimates that crude prices could decline by nearly Rs 9 per litre between September 2023 and March 2024. Since the last fuel price revision in April, oil prices have fallen by 20%, leading to wider margins for fuel retailers. BofA Securities suggests that the government could leverage these gains.
“The government could see a revenue boost of nearly Rs 110 billion annually from every additional rupee earned by oil companies on petroleum products. This could potentially translate to around Rs 1 trillion on an annual basis, or 0.3% of GDP, assuming these numbers hold steady over the next year,” the report stated. This would allow the government to recover revenue lost in the past two years when excise duties were cut to shield consumers from rising energy prices.
Live Events
Should the government opt to pass on the savings to consumers, it could have an immediate impact on inflation. Petrol holds a 2.19% weight in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), while diesel, primarily used for industrial purposes, has a weight of 0.15%. A Rs 5 per litre reduction in fuel prices could lower the fuel index by 5.5%, leading to a 14 basis point direct reduction in inflation, with an additional 14–15 basis points of indirect impact over the next few months, according to the report.
With India importing 80% of its oil needs, the report estimates that a 20% drop in crude prices could result in annual savings of approximately $13 billion for every $10/barrel decrease. This would further strengthen the country's external finances, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already added $67 billion in foreign reserves in 2024 alone.
Brent crude
prices, which recently dropped to $70/barrel — the lowest since December 2021 — remain below $75/barrel, marking a 20% decrease from the April peak of $92/barrel. The report also noted that increased imports of discounted Russian crude have contributed to reduced energy costs for India.

Bid to promote green funding: Centre reviews proposals to promote transition finance,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/bid-to-promote-green-funding-centre-reviews-proposals-to-promote-transition-finance/articleshow/113643272.cms,24-09-2024,"New Delhi: The government is examining recommendations to promote
transition finance
, aimed at helping high carbon-emitting industries fund their shift towards
decarbonisation
at lower interest rates.
One of the suggestions made by stakeholders, including banks, is to create a specific fund set up by state-run financial institutions for lending and refinance to smaller and emerging companies, said people aware of the developments.
""The proposed fund structure aims to help smaller companies scale up green operations and secure lower-cost credit, tied to meeting specific
carbon emissions
reduction targets,"" said an official, who did not wish to be identified, adding that it would be easier to monitor smaller firms to ensure that they are following norms and not greenwashing.
Greenwashing refers to firms falsely claiming that they are reducing polluting emissions.
The fund can be set up by firms such as
IIFCL
and
IREDA
, and developmental financial institution NaBFID, the official said, adding, ""This is also being discussed with sectoral regulators like the
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) and market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India."" ""More clarity will emerge when the sector definitions are in place, making it easier for foreign investors to participate,"" said another official.
Live Events
Suggestions on transition finance are part of various measures being examined to promote
green finance
, according to the official.
The government is expected to come out with a taxonomy for climate finance in the next seven to 10 months, as announced in the budget in July.
Separately, bankers in August met officials from France for discussion on green finance and climate change. ""It was held through the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), and there were discussions on how G20 nations can help fund the cost of transformation to a low-carbon economy in developing countries,"" said a senior bank executive, adding that this was also shared with the finance ministry. In her budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the government would develop a taxonomy for climate finance to help improve the availability of funds for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ""This will support the achievement of the country's climate commitments and green transition,"" she said.
Last month, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das acknowledged the scalability challenges in green bond and green deposit frameworks and observed that the market for green bonds needed to expand significantly to attract larger issuances and a diverse set of investors. ""Ensuring authenticity and the impact of green projects, financed through these frameworks, requires robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms,"" he said.

money market
dealers said.
The WACR, which is the operating target of the RBI's monetary policy, was at 6.68% the previous day. The
WACR
rises when liquidity conditions in the banking system are in a deficit mode.
The banking system liquidity, as measured by net injection of funds by the RBI, stood at a deficit of Rs. 33,447 crore, as of September 23, central bank data showed.
Banking system liquidity is in a deficit mode due to advance tax payments and goods and services tax (GST) outflows and is expected to go back in surplus mode in October as
government spending
kicks off again, said market participants.
To ease liquidity conditions, the RBI conducted short term variable rate repo (VRR) auctions on Monday and Tuesday worth Rs. 1,00,101

"Fake registration drive: GST officers detect 10,700 bogus firms, over Rs 10k cr evasion",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/fake-registration-drive-gst-officers-detect-10700-bogus-firms-over-rs-10k-cr-evasion/articleshow/113627617.cms,24-09-2024,"New Delhi: Tax officers have detected around 10,700 fake registrations under the GST, involving evasion of Rs 10,179 crore in the ongoing all-India drive against
fake companies
set up to defraud the exchequer, a senior official said on Tuesday.
Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs
(CBIC) member Shashank Priya said
Aadhaar authentication
of
GST registration
is already in place in 12 states and by October 4, another four states would join.
Eventually, 20 states, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, will start Aadhaar authentication.
Speaking at an Assocham event, Shashank Priya also said that in future, the tax authorities may also put certain restrictions on new taxpayers based on their risk profile.
""How many invoices they can issue in a month, we may also put some restriction on that in the future... We feel very pained at the misuse of the system. We have to use all methods that are at our command to ensure that those are stopped,"" he said.
The CBIC official also said that the government is taking targeted action to check fake GST registration and more physical verification is taking place.
Live Events
The second all-India drive against fake registration began on August 16 and will continue till October 15.
He said the tax authorities have identified 67,970 GSTINs. Of this, 59 per cent of the GSTINs or 39,965 have been verified as of September 22.
Shashank Priya said, ""27 per cent have been found to be non-existent. This percentage is almost similar compared to the last drive. We have detected evasion of Rs 10,179 crore. Blocked ITC of Rs 2,994 crore. Also, recovery of Rs 28 crore has been done (in the second drive till September 22).""
In the first drive against fake registration between May 16, 2023 and July 15, 2023, a total of 21,791 entities having GST registration were discovered to be non-existent.
An amount of Rs 24,010 crore of suspected
tax evasion
was detected during the first special drive last year.
In the GST regime, there is a problem of data mismatches which is leading to more than one lakh show cause notices being issued last fiscal by tax officers, he said.
""Going forward, we are proposing at some point in time, we have not decided when there will be a system to lock (GSTR-3B). But before that, we will make sure that all the areas, all the channels through which input tax comes they are reflected in the ledgers and returns so that they are populated to GSTR-3B and then it is locked. But that is for the future,"" Shashank Priya said.
He said going forward once the GSTR-1A and the Invoice Management System (IMS) stabilise, there would be no need for an edit facility of GSTR-3B.
""Whatever figure goes in GSTR-3B that gets locked in. That would be an ideal situation for taxpayers and tax administration,"" he added.
GSTR-1A gives an option to taxpayers to amend outward supply or sales return form (GSTR-1), while GSTR-3B is used to pay taxes monthly.
Separately, GSTN would start the IMS from October 1, which will facilitate taxpayers in matching their records/invoices vis-a-vis issued by their suppliers for availing the correct
Input Tax Credit
(ITC). IMS would enable taxpayers to efficiently address invoice corrections/ amendments with their suppliers through the portal.
During 2023-24, Shashank Priya said, 1,12,852 show cause notices were issued.
The major areas of dispute are short
payment
of GST in GSTR-3B as compared to GSTR-1 liability, excess ITC availed in GSTR-3B, non-payment of GST under reverse charge mechanism, interest for late filing of GSTR-3B and GSTR-1, ITC availed beyond prescribed time limit, difference in taxable value in e-way bill issued and taxable value reported in GSTR-3B, and classification issues.
""Out of the seven major areas of disputes, 6 relate to data discrepancies. So if we can address data mismatches by use of technology, then we will be able to solve a lot of disputes and pain points of the taxpayer,"" he said.
Out of the 1.12 lakh SCN, only 555 pertains to classification disputes. ""So policy level disputes are much less,"" he said, adding that the CBIC is analysing these classification disputes to see if any policy guidelines to address them.

The
Supreme Court
in 2021 allowed the government to disinvest its residual stake in Hindustan Zinc in the open market.
Meanwhile, Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) has held fresh discussions with the government on a proposal to divide the company into two verticals, instead of three proposed earlier, CEO Arun Misra had said on Wednesday.
The company's restructuring plan to create separate entities was put on hold as the government had expressed resistance to the bid.
Misra had said with regard to Hindustan Zinc's demerger, the discussions happened very well with the government.
The Mines Ministry had earlier written to the company, pointing out that any restructuring of business operations would require the ministry's clearance.
Misra had said that he was with the mines secretary recently and both the government and HZL are communicating on this subject which is ""big"".

capex loans
to states so far out of the total ₹1.5 lakh crore allocated for FY25.
""So far, ₹46,000 crore has been approved for sanction under the capex loan to states, out of which ₹25,000 crore has been released,"" a senior government official told ET. Of the ₹95,000 crore conditional loan, ₹25,000 crore is linked to the capex performance of states. States will get half of the corresponding share only after reporting capex growth of 10% or more in FY24, and the remaining 50% after achieving a 10% growth in capex this fiscal.
""This will provide an incentive for states to increase their capex,"" the official said.
The Centre had allocated ₹1.30 lakh crore in FY24 as loans to states towards capex. The amount was later pared by 19% to ₹1.05 lakh crore as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Punjab did not get the loans having failed to meet the eligibility requirements. This year, ₹15,000 crore is allocated for
industrial growth
and livelihood-friendly cities, which will be given on first-cum-first-serve basis to states.
Another ₹15,000 crore is linked to completion of major urban and rural
infrastructure projects
such as railways, metro rail, highway and power projects, ₹5,000 crore to urban land reforms and ₹5,000 crore to rural land reforms.

Real money gaming sector tops GST evasion list,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/real-money-gaming-sector-tops-gst-evasion-list/articleshow/113362172.cms,15-09-2024,"The real money
online gaming
sector topped the apex goods and services tax (
GST
) intelligence and investigation agency’s evasion list with detection to the tune of about Rs 1.10 lakh crore, involving show cause notices to 34 taxpayers, action against 118 domestic entities and 658 offshore entities.
In its annual report released Saturday, the
Directorate General of GST Intelligence
(DGGI) identified online
gaming
as one of the challenging sectors with offshore entities based in tax havens.
“Bringing the gaming entities under tax net continues to be an uphill task,” the report said. Use of the dark web and virtual private networks (VPNs) based platforms for such have been cited as key challenges.
The report added that the DGGI had recommended 167 URLs and websites for blocking.
""Many such firms are set up in offshore tax havens (Malta, Curacao Islands, British Virgin Islands, Cyprus etc.), known for their opacity, thus making it difficult to ascertain their ultimate ownership,"" DGGI said in its report. Some online
gaming platforms
keep changing URLs and apps to avoid tax compliance.

The DGGI recommended a multi-agency approach to deal with this sector.
“An inter-departmental committee, comprising the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Enforcement Directorate, ministries of electronics and information technology, corporate affairs, information and broadcasting, consumer affairs, Reserve Bank… along with industry bodies may be set up to develop comprehensive strategy and regulations to combat the proliferation of such platforms, ensuring regulatory compliance,
consumer protection
and national security,” the report said.
Creating awareness and education among digital citizens about safe and responsible gaming practices, promoting the use of legitimate platforms registered with Meity and entering into reciprocal arrangements with foreign governments for information sharing and
tax enforcement
may go a long way toward effecting regulatory compliance.

The Finance Ministry said in a statement, ""As part of a broader initiative to streamline and rationalise existing rules and regulations to further facilitate ease of doing business, the compounding proceeding rules were comprehensively reviewed in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India.""

The finance ministry is also working to introduce digital payment options for application fees and compounding amounts, with a focus on simplification and rationalisation of the provisions to eliminate ambiguity and clarify the process.
""These amendments indicate the commitment of the government towards promoting 'ease of investment' for investors and 'ease of doing business' for businesses,"" the ministry said.
The Compounding of Foreign Exchange (FEMA) Proceedings Rules, 2000 govern the process of resolving or settling offences related to violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999.
Compounding under these rules allows individuals or entities to admit a violation and pay a penalty to avoid protracted litigation or criminal prosecution.
The move was taken after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman emphasised that the government would prioritise foreign investment in the country and that it would come up with flexible rules to promote foreign investments.
The finance minister has indicated in her budget speech that the rules and regulations for FDIs and overseas Investments will be simplified to facilitate foreign direct investments, nudge prioritisation, and promote opportunities for using Indian Rupee as a currency for overseas investments.

The government's allocation for the flagship universal health coverage scheme was increased in the budget for 2024-25 to ₹7,300 crore from the revised estimate of ₹6,800 crore for the financial year.
It is not yet clear if this would suffice to absorb the additional cost for increased central share on account of the latest extension of the scheme to
senior citizens
.
For now, however, the government has yet to accept the other expansion proposal to double the health coverage to ₹10 lakh which could increase the overall cost to the exchequer considerably.

On Wednesday, the Union cabinet approved the health coverage to all senior citizens in the country aged 70 years and above irrespective of income under the flagship scheme. It is expected to benefit about 45 million families - with 60 million senior citizens - with free
health insurance cover
of ₹5 lakh per family per annum.
An
electoral promise
that figured prominently in the BJP's manifesto ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the expanded AB-PMJAY could, however, spark political controversy over
central funding
.
At present, about a dozen states are already giving a range of health coverage benefits to senior citizens over 70 years of age, at their own cost. The latest expansion of AB-PMJAY will allow them the opportunity to get 60:40 fund sharing, with the Centre footing a larger share of the bill.
This process, however, will involve merging the component with the centrally sponsored scheme and adopting its rulebooks and nomenclature, which underlines the central role.
The Centre is unlikely to allow separation of the expanded scope of the scheme - health coverage for those above 70 years of age - as an independent scheme, according to the people cited earlier.
Several such schemes have run into rough weather, especially in the opposition-ruled states, on account of political messaging.
A case in point is Tamil Nadu's continued wrangling with the Union education ministry over the PM SHRI model school scheme tied up with Samagra Shiksha funding. Similar instances have been seen in West Bengal and Punjab, among other states.
The original AB PM-JAY scheme also took time to scale up for similar reasons.

"Rise in cess, surcharge shrinking states' share in divisive pool of taxes: Kerala CM",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rise-in-cess-surcharge-shrinking-states-share-in-divisive-pool-of-taxes-kerala-cm/articleshow/113281765.cms,12-09-2024,"Thiruvananthapuram:
Kerala
Chief Minister
Pinarayi Vijayan
on Thursday said that the cess and
surcharge
levied by the Centre was showing a ""rising trend"" and resulting in ""shrinkage"" of states' share in the divisive pool of taxes.
Vijayan said the rise in surcharges and cesses, which are not included in the divisive pool, was happening at a time when the
Finance Commission
has been recommending a higher share for the states from the net proceeds of the taxes collected by the Centre.
Vijayan was speaking at a conclave of five non-BJP-ruled states organised by Kerala to discuss the key issues related to the 16th Finance Commission. He said that the 16th Finance Commission needs to factor in this rising trend in surcharges and cesses, when it recommends the prescribed share of the states from the net proceeds of taxes collected by the union government.
The CM further said that the share of the states in the divisive pool needs to be increased further from the 41 per cent recommended by the
last Finance Commission
. He said that Kerala and many other states have made this
demand
in the past with the southern state suggesting that it be increased to 50 per cent.
""The demand for a higher share for the states in the taxes collected by the Union is having continued relevance and it is my request to the eminent scholars and colleagues who are here to formulate this in a concrete manner. ""This will help the states to make an effective case before the 16th Finance Commission for raising the share of taxes which are distributed to the states, in view of the widening vertical fiscal Imbalances,"" Vijayan said.

Sitharaman-led GST Council has a key task now to develop a long-term vision for tax,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/sitharaman-led-gst-council-has-a-key-task-now-to-develop-a-long-term-vision-for-tax/articleshow/113254159.cms,11-09-2024,"As
GST Council
concluded it 54th Council meeting, it was clear that the council had once again quickly reacted to certain industry pain points and rectified them and also simultaneously put in place GOMs for long-term policy corrections.. Its tax policy administration at its best and the spirit of cooperative federalism shown is the icing on that cake.
The Council's recommendations encompass a wide array of initiatives, starting from rationalization of GST rates on various goods and services and regularizing the past period on ‘as-is where-is basis’ to avoid any future litigation like in case of film distribution service, provide exemptions on research and development services and reducing tax rates on cancer drugs.
The GST council also brought about changes in the law and rates to rectify unintended levies and demands starting with exempting import of services by an establishment of a foreign airlines company from a related person outside India, when made without consideration and regularizing past cases on an ‘as is where is’ basis thereby putting to rest the huge demands that were raised on foreign airlines in the recent past. Further, clarifying the place of supply in case of advertising services and data-hosting services when provided to foreign entity to be the location of recipient thereby to be treated as export of services, are all decisions that will help resolve multiple ongoing litigations and provide the much-needed relief to the respective industries.
Want to know what GST Council decided in 54th meeting? Click Here
Another key outcome of the council meeting was the formulation of two new GoMs which have been created to find possible solutions to some critical issues, namely – GoM on life and health insurance and GoM to study the future of compensation cess with the mandate to present their findings by Oct 24 end to enable the council to deliberate on the same and achieve consensus.
GoM has further made an effort to streamline the metal industry by accepting their long standing demand of making the payment on reverse charge for supply of metal screap from unregistered dealers. However, given that intermediate dealers may be unregistered there is a possibility of substantial cascading in certain situations. Accordingly, the fine print is awaited to understand the complete implications.

The introduction of e-invoicing for B2C transactions is a major step towards streamlining compliances and moving towards refunds for goods purchased and exported by foreign tourists. Also, the IMS system is a major step to bring efficiency in credit availment and was proposed in the initial implementation of the GSTN portal, but deferred due to technical issues. However, there is a need to make explicit provisions under law to give it a legal backing. Both these changes will take compliances to a new level and would bring maturity to the current GST processes.
Here's everything Finance Minister Sitharaman and the GST Council decided
With every meeting, the council takes a step towards streamlining and resolving disputes under the GST law. While a lot has already been achieved by the Council, the same is a continued journey of democratized decision making. While the decisions taken by GST Council are a testament to the government's commitment to fostering a conducive business environment, it is the need of the hour that the council develops a long-term vision for this tax.
There are two main areas which require council’s immediate attention - the first is re-evaluation of ITC admissibility, which will not only require a complete re-look at Section 17(5) of GST law which restricts credits in some cases but also look at sectors where credits have been restricted to keep the rates low.
The second area which requires immediate attention is the multiplicity of audits, assessment and investigations being carried out on large corporates across the country. Multiple organizations, as part of their revenue augmentation targets, audit and investigate the corporates, most of them having multiple registrations in various jurisdictions. It is time that the council re-formulate the audit process to have centralised coordinated audits with possible rotation between centre and state.
The GST Council's proactive approach in addressing the concerns of industry is a reassuring sign of the government's dedication to making India an easier place to do business. The nation now looks forward to the findings of the GoMs which are set to pave the way for a more streamlined and efficient tax system, ultimately contributing to the overarching goal of
ease of doing business
in India.

Telangana urges 16th Finance Commission to increase states' share in Central taxes to 50%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/telangana-urges-16th-finance-commission-to-increase-states-share-in-central-taxes-to-50/articleshow/113219150.cms,10-09-2024,"Hyderabad: The
Telangana Government
on Tuesday requested the 16th
Finance Commission
to increase the share of states in Central taxes from the existing 41 per cent to 50 per cent as over the years cesses and surcharges that are not shared with states have increased. Deputy Chief Minister in-charge of
finance
Bhatti Vikramarka in his speech at the meeting with
Finance Commission
Chairman
Arvind Panagariya
and members also urged the
finance
panel to ensure that states are given the necessary autonomy to tailor CSS (centrally-sponsored scheme) programmes to their specific development needs.
""In addition, we propose increasing the share of states in Central taxes from 41 per cent to 50 per cent. Over the years, cesses and surcharges that are not shared with states have increased, leaving states with a smaller share of total gross
tax revenue
,"" he said.
Increasing the vertical devolution will give states the fiscal space they need to strengthen welfare programmes, address infrastructure gaps and prioritise local development, he further said.
He, however, said it is not just a demand for
Telangana
but for all states, ensuring a more cooperative federal structure that will benefit the nation as a whole.
Bhatti further said the state government urges the Finance
Commission
to reconsider the use of per capita income distance as the primary indicator in determining horizontal devolution as measuring prosperity and well-being solely by per capita income would deny
Telangana
the resources needed to address the inequities that exist within the state.

The state government is suggesting that the formula for horizontal devolution be modified to add at least a 50 per cent weightage to GSDP (gross state domestic production) contribution.
""A greater weight on GSDP would incentivise states to adopt reforms that improve productivity, attract investment and create jobs, ultimately contributing to the national economy. This approach would not only make states more competitive but also help reduce regional disparities, encouraging more balanced growth across the country,"" he opined.
Pointing out that certain expenditures for schemes such as
Rythu Bharosa
, farm loan waivers and food subsidies are often mislabelled as ""freebies,"" he urged the
Commission
to recognise these programmes as necessary investments in the welfare of our people.
He mentioned that a large part of the state's resources is now being diverted toward
debt
servicing and hence requested the Finance Commission's support in either restructuring this
debt
or providing additional assistance to help free up resources for further development.
The 16th Finance Commission, led by its chairman Arvind Panagariya, held meetings with several political parties, representatives of local bodies and industry chambers here on Monday as part of its visit to Telangana.

GST Council spices things up: Here's what got cheaper overnight in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-council-spices-things-up-heres-what-got-cheaper-overnight-in-india/articleshow/113214656.cms,10-09-2024,"The
GST Council
’s meeting on Monday added some flavor to the Indian tax system, announcing significant cuts aimed at making essential services and goods more affordable. Among the key reductions were tax cuts on cancer drugs, helicopter travel, and snacks like
namkeen
.
In a series of decisions, the Council reduced GST on select cancer medications to 5 per cent, cut the levy on fried snacks (namkeen) from 18 per cent to 12 per cent, and lowered the tax on shared helicopter rides to 5 per cent.
Drugs
: Among the most significant decisions, the reduction of GST on life-saving cancer drugs like
Trastuzumab Deruxtecan
, Osimertinib, and Durvalumab from 12 per cent to 5 per cent was praised as a step towards making these treatments more accessible. Industry experts highlighted the importance of this move, which complements the customs duty exemption for cancer drugs announced earlier this year. ""With the increasing burden of chronic diseases in India, this is a move toward making life-saving drugs accessible and improving health outcomes,"" said
Sudarshan Jain
, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance.
R&D activities
: The Council also agreed to exempt research and development (R&D) activities funded by private and public sources, including universities, from GST, marking a win for educational institutions engaged in R&D under central or state laws.
Helicopter travel booking
: The decision to reduce GST on helicopter travel booked on a 'seat-share' basis to 5 per cent will benefit travelers to popular pilgrimage destinations like Kedarnath-Badrinath and Vaishno Devi. However, chartered helicopter services will continue to attract the higher 18 per cent GST.
Namkeens (Snacks)
: The GST rate has been reduced prospectively from 18 per cent to 12 per cent for namkeens and savoury items.
In addition to these tax reductions, the Council deferred decisions on two key issues: lowering GST on health and life insurance and extending the compensation cess beyond January 2026. These matters were referred to two ministerial panels for further consideration. The panel on insurance, led by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister
Samrat Chaudhary
, will review the exemption thresholds, treatment of senior citizens, and group insurance sales by resident welfare associations, with recommendations expected by the end of October.
The Council also clarified that uncooked or unfried snack pellets will attract a 5 per cent tax, while increasing the GST on car and motorcycle seats from 18 per cent to 28 per cent. Roof-mounted package unit air conditioners used in railways were also moved into the highest GST slab. The decision on taxing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations was postponed.
Live Events
However, there was no relief for
payment
aggregators, who had launched a social media campaign seeking exemptions after receiving tax notices last month. Revenue Secretary
Sanjay Malhotra
confirmed that the exemption currently only applies to banks.
As part of its broader agenda, the Council also aligned preferential location charges (PLC) for residential, commercial, and industrial properties with the same GST rate applicable to construction services.

It is setting up two groups of ministers - one to look into GST on life and health insurance premiums and a second to examine the compensation cess. Members also discussed the status report on rate rationalisation by a ministerial panel as well as tax of online gaming.
The exemption provided to foreign airlines will provide significant relief for the sector that was facing a tax demand of about ₹39,000 crore.
Regularisation of Tax Notices
Educational institutions set up under state and central laws and those exempt from income tax won't have to pay GST on research and development grants.
This will regularise the existing show-cause notices issued to seven institutions, including IITs, by the
Directorate General of GST Intelligence

The finance minister clarified that the tax notices sent to the institutions were merely an interpretational issue. ""The issue of research related funds going to institutions and notice which had gone to seven such institutions was not an attempt at tax terrorism and I say this with certain responsibility,"" union finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said, adding that the matter was flagged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself recently.
Briefing reporters on the outcome of the 54th
GST Council
meeting on Monday,
Sitharaman
said it had mandated a group of ministers (GoM) to look into the GST on life and health insurance premiums. The
GoM
has been asked to submit its report by October end, she said, adding that the issue would then be taken up at the November meeting of the council. The GoM will be headed by Bihar deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary, who also leads the panel on GST rate rationalisation. The issue of taxation of insurance premiums had come up in parliament with opposition members asking that they be exempted from GST.
First GST meeting since PM Modi's third term
This was the first meeting of the GST Council after the formation of the new government at the Centre in June.
The GST Council also decided to set up a GoM to decide on the roadmap for the compensation cess beyond March 2026 and will take a call on the additional ₹40,000 crore collected after adjusting for back-to-back loans taken by the states and interest.
The minister said a committee of secretaries headed by additional secretary, revenue, will be formed on integrated GST, which is currently facing a negative balance. It will look into ways to retrieve the money from states.
Other decisions
The council approved the introduction of B2C e-invoicing to facilitate consumers on a voluntary basis in select states. It also decided to bring renting of commercial property by unregistered persons to a registered person and supply of scrap under the reverse charge mechanism (RCM) under GST to prevent revenue leakage.

GST Council meet
ing on Monday, the Centre decided to cut down on the cost of
namkeen
and savoury products, announced Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
at the press meet after the meet. The GST rate on such products have been reduced prospectively to 12 percent from 18 percent, she said.
""Decision on namkeens, extruded, expanded savoury food items - GST rate on these is being reduced prospectively from 18 to 12 percent,"" she said during the press conference. The finance minister further clarified that the GST rate has been reduced 'prospectively' and not 'retrospectively.'
The food items that are included in this are extruded or expanded savoury or salted products, excluding un-fried or un-cooked snack pellets (regardless of their name) produced through extrusion and classified under HS 1905 90 30.
This aligns the rate with that of namkeens, bhujia, mixture, chabena (pre-packaged and labeled), and similar ready-to-eat preparations classified under HS 2106 90.
Snacks made using the extrusion process will be taxed at 18 percent. However, other snacks and savory items, such as bhujia, could potentially be subject to a 12 percent GST.
Live Events
However, un-fried or un-cooked snack pellets produced through extrusion will continue to be taxed at a GST rate of 5 percent.
Currently, expanded snacks face an 18 percent GST, while regular savory snacks are taxed at 12 percent, which the recent ratification addressed.
The Fitment Committee established by the Council recommended classifying these items as savory snacks. Therefore, new cases will be subject to a 12 percent GST, while existing cases will continue to incur an 18 percent GST for the time being.
The press briefing was held by the Finance Minister, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chowdhury, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra, Chairperson CBIC Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, and researchers Shanshank Priya and Vivek Ranjan in New Delhi.
Other major announcements from the 54th GST Council meet
The recent council meeting reviewed a status report on online gaming, which showed a staggering 412 percent increase in gambling revenue, reaching Rs 6,909 crore over six months. In response, two new Groups of Ministers (GoMs) have been established - one to focus on medical and health insurance and another to decide the use of compensation cess after March 2025.
Additionally, the GoM on rate rationalization, now including new members specifically for medical insurance, has been tasked with submitting a report in October for discussion at the committee's November meeting.

GST Council meet
on Monday, Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
announced that the Centre has seen a 412 percent jump in
revenue
from the increased levy on online gaming, according to a status report submitted to the fitment committee.
""Revenue from online gaming has increased 412 percent reaching ₹6,909 crore in six months,"" Sitharaman said, adding that revenues of
casinos
have ""jumped by 30%.""
Online games
, including skill-based and chance-based, were placed in the 28 percent GST slab in the 50th GST meeting in July 2023. It came into effect from October 1, 2023. Earlier,
skill-based games
were taxed at 18 percent.
This is in addition to the
tax
on winnings from different gaming tournaments that are either in the form of cash or gift prize. As per the income tax law, these winnings are treated as winnings from online games and taxed at 30 per cent under the head 'Income from other Sources'.
Prime Minister Nardendra Modi had recently acknowledged the country’s gaming potential, saying in his Independence Day speech, “I am seeing a big market that has come up in the field of gaming, but even today, the gaming world has a big foreign impact in terms of producing the games and earning revenues. India has a big heritage in the area and we can bring lots of new talent to the world of gaming.”
Live Events
How has the gaming industry fared after the hike in GST?
Reports suggest that the industry has struggled since the increase in GST. According to a study by EY, the placement of online games in the highest tax bracket has affected the industry negatively. A USISPF survey found companies facing challenges in raising funding, making a good margin and have seen a stalled revenue since the GST rates were hiked.
This change resulted in a higher tax burden for companies operating the online gaming sector, most of which had to function with the increase in tax to sustain their operations.
Of the companies surveyed in the study, just 42 percent reported revenue growth following the GST amendment. The growth ranged from 1-25 per cent, while 58 per cent companies faced revenue decline or stagnation. This includes two companies with a massive 50 percent decrease in revenue. This represents a notable shift from the industry's prior trend of exponential growth and highlights the significant financial impact of GST on the online gaming sector.
The hike in GST, absorbed by the companies, led to reduced margins and triggered workforce reductions, including layoffs, hiring freezes, and in some cases, operations were completely shut.
What do gaming companies want?
Most companies have recommended an amendment of the GST valuation mechanism to a ‘net deposit’ model (i.e., GGR/ platform fee), and some companies have recommended reducing the total withdrawals from the total deposits for GST purposes.
The online gaming industry has been filing returns since 2017, but they paid 18 percent from August 18, 2017 and October 2023.
The issue got complex with the GST department's decision that all games involving bets played between August 2017 and October 1 2023 would have to pay a tax of 28 per cent instead of the earlier 18 per cent.
As many as 71 online gaming companies have received tax notices to pay a total of Rs 1.12 lakh crore, with some demands surpassing their annual turnover, according to the GST department's calculations.
India currently has 442 million gamers, the second largest in the world behind China. The industry is valued at $3.1 billion and is expected to grow to $8.92 billion in the next five years.

GST Council Meeting Key Takeaways
The Fitment Committee, comprising the Centre and state tax officials, on Monday presented a report giving data and analysis and implications of GST reduction on life, health and reinsurance premiums.
Live Events
The
54th GST Council meeting
was expected to bring relief to individuals and senior citizens with a significant decision on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate applied to health insurance premiums.
The current GST rate on health and life insurance policies stands at 18 per cent, and the industry was expecting that this could be reduced to ease the financial burden on policyholders.
A report on the implications of GST levied on life, health, and reinsurance premiums will be presented to the GST Council, reported PTI, citing sources. After reviewing this report, the Council was expected to discuss whether to proceed with a reduction in the GST rate on health insurance premiums. There was also a speculation that the
GST on health insurance
premiums could be slashed from 18 per cent to nil.
The fitment committee, consisting of central and state tax officials, convened on Sunday to weigh the pros and cons of reducing the GST rate on health premiums.
Additionally, the GST Council is expected to address other financial matters, such as the taxation of online payments exceeding Rs 2,000. Currently, online transactions made through payment gateways are not subject to GST, and this issue was likely to be discussed during the meeting.
West Bengal Finance Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya had already submitted a request to reduce the 18 per cent GST rate on life and health insurance premiums. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, who leads the reconstituted Group of Ministers on GST for rate rationalisation, acknowledged last month that changes to health insurance tax rates are under review.
The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising state finance ministers, is responsible for determining the tax rate adjustments.

Tax terrorism? A storm brewing in India’s academic circles can't be taken for granted,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/tax-terrorism-a-storm-brewing-in-indias-academic-circles-cant-be-taken-for-granted/articleshow/113184131.cms,09-09-2024,"Seven prominent Indian institutions, including the prestigious
IIT Delhi
and Anna University in Chennai, are facing a significant financial challenge: they have received showcause notices from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) for unpaid taxes on
research grants
given since 2017. This move has sparked a major debate within the academic community, with some calling it ""tax terrorism"", ToI reported.
The DGGI's stance is that research and development grants received by educational institutions are not exempt from taxes, but many academicians, scientists, and funding agencies argue otherwise, noting that such grants are typically hard to secure and are often tax-exempt in other countries.
Institutions like IIT Delhi have been asked to pay ₹120 crore, including penalties, over the past seven years. Others are facing demands ranging from ₹5 crore to ₹60 crore.
Infosys
co-founder T V
Mohandas Pai
voiced his discontent on social media, tagging GST India and PM Modi, calling the situation “tax terrorism.”

“GST on research grants will reduce money allocated for research. So, the govt must remove GST,” said Kris Gopalakrishnan, another Infosys co-founder who is a strong advocate for education and funds research projects in institutions like IIT and Indian Institute of Science (IISc). ToI said, according to experts, research inherently involves risks, and without the burden of taxes, institutions are more likely to invest in innovative, high-risk projects potentially leading to groundbreaking discoveries. They argue that some significant research studies span several years.

Orthopaedic surgeon Dr George Thomas, former editor of the Journal of Indian Medical Ethics, emphasized the importance of long-term investments in research. “The Framingham Heart Study, for instance, is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study of residents of Massachusetts that began in 1948,” he said. “The National Institutes of Health invested USD 14 million in the Lower Extremities Assessment Project (LEAP), a comprehensive research initiative designed to evaluate and improve outcomes in patients with severe injuries of the legs. Without large investments, breakthrough research is difficult. Taxing research grants reduces the already low investments.”
Researchers also pointed out that funds for research have not increased in line with inflation, while the scope of research has expanded. Scientist Ashok Jhunjhunwala, who has chaired government committees and boards of institutions like IIT, suggests that
GST on research grants
could be absorbed by the grantee. “When researchers receive grant money from the ministry, the govt should pay the GST. Researchers would welcome it because they currently pay GST on equipment or components bought with grant funds. If grants were given with GST already paid, they could offset the GST costs they currently bear,” he explained.
Research grants are typically itemized with specific amounts allocated for equipment, components, travel, salaries, and overheads. “Where is the GST money supposed to come from within this? Placing a GST demand on research institutions is just harassment,” Jhunjhunwala further elaborated. Several universities are now preparing for litigation against the GST demand, but legal experts are urging the Centre to reconsider before the matter reaches the courts.
“GST is levied on the supply of goods and services,” stated K Vaitheeswaran, an advocate and tax expert heading the taxation committee of the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “For example, at a shop there is a tax on sold goods. GST is on the supply of goods or services for consideration. When a university receives a research grant, there is no quid pro quo to provide any goods or services. A grant is not a consideration; it is akin to a donation.”
Legal experts argue that research outcomes are uncertain and may not always result in saleable goods or services. Therefore, research grants and donations, whether from government or private agencies, should not be taxed based on anticipated outcomes but on actual monetized results. They further noted, “When income tax provides an accelerated tax shield for research institutions notified under section 35(1)(ii), GST too should extend the same reasoning and logic for research grants.”
Delhi Minister Atishi expressed her opposition to
GST on research
grants and other services during a GST Council meeting. “Show cause notices have been sent to big educational institutes including IIT Delhi and Punjab University. It is wrong. Research is an investment in development of the country. There shouldn't be a GST on research grants. On one hand, the Centre is decreasing the research grants and on the other, they are levying GST. We will oppose it,” she said. She also noted concerns about GST potentially being levied on online payments via gateways, which could burden startups.
Academicians are hopeful that this issue will be discussed at the GST Council meeting on September 9, chaired by Union Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
. “Research grants to universities must be considered a subsidy as funds are used solely for delivering public good without any profit motive, making it a quasi-government endeavour by the university,” said one academician.
T V Mohandas Pai suggested setting up an expert committee within GST India akin to the one at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. “Questions should be referred to this committee, position paper prepared, put out for public comments and after that issued as the official view,” he recommended. “This will ensure uniform policy throughout the industry and eliminate arbitrary action by GST officers which harm the country and business as well as reduce tax terrorism. Officials must raise contestable questions and debate it out before they issue such notices.
Tax on research grants
given to universities can have a chilling effect on research outputs. I hope it’s axed.”

Surplus liquidity shows govt's foot on spending pedal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/surplus-liquidity-shows-govts-foot-on-spending-pedal/articleshow/113173466.cms,10-09-2024,"A rebound in
government expenditure
is evident from a build-up of surplus liquidity conditions in the banking sector, as the Centre loosens its purse strings and injects cash into the system. The absence of the key driver of economic growth had been felt in the first quarter of the year. Analysts are of the view that the Reserve Bank of India’s tolerance of surplus liquidity suggests it could be gradually gearing up toward a softer
monetary policy
.
Last week, while emphasising that India’s growth story remains intact after a lower-than-expected expansion of 6.7% in the GDP in June quarter, central bank governor Shaktikanta Das buttressed his statement by saying that government expenditure would pick up pace for the rest of the year in line with budget estimates. Banking system metrics suggest that the pick-up has been steadily underway for the last couple of months.
For all of July, August and so far in September, the banking system has experienced surplus liquidity conditions, with the average amount of funds lenders have parked with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on a daily basis clocking in at Rs 1.34 lakh crore, an analysis of central bank data showed. When the
RBI
absorbs funds from banks it indicates the prevalence of surplus liquidity conditions. From a peak of more than Rs 5 lakh crore in May, when elections were in full swing, the government’s cash balance has dropped sharply now, indicating the Centre’s spending push.
“The rise in (surplus) liquidity conditions represents a pick-up in government expenditure post the election,” said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist,
IDFC First Bank
. “This is reflected in the reduction of the government cash surplus to Rs 2.3 lakh crore as of August 2024 from peak levels of Rs 5.1 lakh crore as of May 24.”
Banking system liquidity
was broadly in deficit mode in May and June.
Live Events
Spending by the government typically flows through the banking system, thereby increasing cash with lenders, although expenditure reforms by the Centre over the past few years have reduced that float.
Das had said last week that the headline GDP growth number for the first quarter had printed lower than expectation, perhaps due to muted spending by the Centre and states during the general elections, which ended in early June.
Borrowing Costs, RBI Stance
The easier cash conditions in the banking system over the past two months have brought down the weighted average rate for the overnight segment of money markets, which represents banks’ overnight cost of funds.
“One of the most notable statements in the recent speech by the RBI governor was that the balance for growth and inflation is very well poised. This is a significant shift from the August policy statement where he mentioned unambiguous focus on inflation,” said Anubhuti Sahay, head, India, economic research, Standard Chartered Bank. “Assuming there are no negative surprises on inflation, I think the comfort with liquidity is likely to remain and that can then move a step forward by bringing a change in stance and then probably rate cuts beginning by the end of the year.”
The weighted average rate for the overnight segment of money markets has averaged 6.38% from July 1 to September 5, 12 basis points lower than the central bank’s repo rate of 6.50%. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
The easier liquidity and lower cost of overnight funds has reduced yields on the government’s treasury bills, which are used as pricing benchmarks for various credit products across the economy. From an auction on June 26 to the latest on September 4, yields on T-bills of different maturities have dropped 17 basis points to 24 basis points, RBI data showed.
In 2023, when the RBI was faced with an abrupt rise in food inflation in the second half of the year, the central bank was averse to tolerating surplus liquidity in the banking system, given its potential inflationary impact.
In the last few months, the RBI has taken some steps to rein in the amount of rupee liquidity being added to the banking system through foreign flows into debt. The central bank has conducted open market bond sales worth a total Rs 18,225 crore through secondary market operations between mid-July and now. However, it has stopped short of conducting large-scale, open-market sales of government bonds through auctions.
Indian debt markets received net inflows worth $4.8 billion in July and August, official depository data showed.

In August alone, the state government borrowed ₹10,000 crore loans in four equal installments. In the last fiscal year, Madhya Pradesh borrowed ₹76,230 crore as per revised budget estimate, taking the total debt of the state to ₹4,18,056 crore. The BJP government is planning to borrow ₹94,431 crore this fiscal year.
The state has allocated ₹18,984 crore for the Ladli Behna scheme this year. In addition, it offers ₹4,775 crore on agriculture pump subsidy, ₹3,500 crore for offering 100 units of electricity at ₹100, ₹6,290 crore on electricity
subsidy
to farmers and ₹1,231 crore for the
Ladli Laxmi
scheme for girls. The above subsidies and direct cash transfer amount to a total of ₹34,780 crore.
This year, it made a provision of ₹1,17, 945 crore for salaries, pension and interest payment on loans. The state government has estimated a
fiscal deficit
of 4.1% of the state GDP or GSDP, which is higher than 3.5% recommended by the central government. In his budget speech, deputy chief minister Jagdish Devda had said the state will try to bring the fiscal deficit back to the prescribed limits.
Karnataka
The
Congress
government in March hired consultancy firm Boston Consulting to suggest measures to generate additional ₹55,000-60,000 crore to fulfil the five guarantees it promised to the people during elections in 2023. In June, the government increased sales tax on diesel and petrol saying the state needs funds to fulfil its guarantees.
In FY24, the state spent ₹36,000 crore for the guarantees. This year, it has earmarked ₹53,674 crore for five guarantees. More than half of it (₹28,608 crore) has been allocated to the Gruha Lakshmi Scheme, which provides women head of each BPL family ₹2,000 per month. The other schemes include free power for agriculture, free bus rides for women and free units of electricity to households among others. Karnataka plans to borrow ₹1,05, 246 crore in the current budget. The state's borrowings have significantly increased over the past two years.
Punjab
The AAP government is spending ₹17,110 crore for free electricity to farmers and households. The state fiscal deficit is at 3.8% of the SGDP, higher than the recommended 3.5%. The outstanding liability on the state stands at ₹3,51,130 crore as of March 2024, according to RBI data.
Telangana
The Congress government has earmarked ₹20,378 crore for fulfilling the poll promises. The amount includes ₹15,470 crore for debt relief to farmers, ₹3,083 crore for Mahalakshmi free bus ride to women and ₹1,825 crore for free 200 units of electricity to households. The government is yet to provide the promised financial assistance to women under the Mahalakshmi scheme. In the budget, it announced a support of ₹12,000 annually to agriculture labourers and housing assistance of ₹5-6 lakh to SC/ST to help build 450,000 houses.
Finance minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka in his budget speech said the state needs ₹31,000 crore for fulfilling farmers' loan waiver promise and it is working on ways to generate this money. The government is currently reviewing all the ongoing schemes to rationalise them and continue only those found to be useful for the state. This was mentioned in the budget document of 2024-25.

GST cut on health insurance: You may not celebrate a likely tax cut this time,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-cut-on-health-insurance-you-may-not-celebrate-a-likely-tax-cut-this-time/articleshow/113145019.cms,07-09-2024,"As the
GST Council
prepares for its next meeting on Monday, a big topic on the agenda is the high
GST
on health and life insurance policies. While there is talk of lowering the tax, states are worried that insurance companies may not pass the savings on to consumers if there’s no system in place to make sure it happens.
Concerns about health insurance GST cuts
The idea of reducing GST on life insurance seems to be mostly agreed upon, with state finance ministers showing fewer concerns about it. However, the real problem lies with health insurance, and it’s not just about losing revenue.
Official are exploring options that could help consumers, but there's a concern that insurance companies may keep the benefit for themselves and not pass it on to people buying health insurance, a state finance minister told ToI.
Another minister said that although there’s pressure to lower the burden on consumers, companies have been raising premiums ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, citing increased claims. While COVID-related claims have since decreased, insurance companies haven’t given any relief to policyholders. Instead, they claim that the cost of handling claims is still higher than the premiums they collect.

Previously, the government had anti-profiteering laws that ensured businesses passed on tax benefits to consumers when GST rates were reduced. These laws allowed authorities to step in and make sure companies didn’t pocket the savings. However, with fewer GST rate changes happening, the government has made these laws inactive. This leaves officials without the power to guarantee that consumers will see lower premiums if the GST is cut.
Many within the government now agree that the 18% GST on
health insurance
is too high and needs to be reduced. But without an active anti-profiteering body, there’s little assurance that insurance companies will reduce premiums accordingly.
GST on health insurace: Helping only high-premium policies?
One idea on the table is to provide tax relief for policies with annual premiums between ₹50,000 and ₹60,000. However, this may not help most middle-class families. A typical family of four, including two children, often ends up paying around ₹50,000 for a health insurance policy with a cover of ₹15 lakh. But in case of a serious illness, even this amount can be inadequate. For senior citizens, the cost of insurance is much higher due to age and health risks.

Moreover, setting such cut-offs for tax benefits could complicate the GST system, which was originally designed to be simple. Yet, there seems to be a push within the bureaucracy to bring back these kinds of complexities.
States worry about revenue loss from GST cut
The call to lower GST on health insurance gained momentum after Union Transport Minister
Nitin Gadkari
urged the Finance Ministry to scrap GST on these policies. In his letter, Gadkari pointed out the financial burden on citizens, especially retirees and senior citizens who rely on their savings.
This sparked a wider debate about whether it’s fair to heavily tax something as essential as healthcare. In a country with income inequality and a healthcare system in need of improvement, health insurance is seen as a necessity, not a luxury. Despite this, India’s insurance coverage remains low compared to other countries, and the tax on health insurance only makes it harder for people to afford.

No friction between Centre and states over GST, says FM Sitharaman
According to a report from NITI Aayog, about 30% of India’s population, or around 40 crore people, don’t have any financial protection for healthcare. This leaves many vulnerable to high medical bills. While the Economic Survey predicts that India’s insurance coverage will rise from 3.8% of GDP in FY23 to 4.3% by FY35, the immediate issue of the 18% GST on health insurance continues to be a burden for consumers.
Even though there’s pressure to lower GST on health insurance, many states are hesitant because of the potential revenue loss. The GST fitment committee, which includes officials from both the Centre and the states, hasn’t been able to agree on a solution. States worry that cutting the tax could result in a major drop in revenue, especially now that they no longer receive compensation from the Centre, as they did in the early days of GST.
Between April 2021 and March 2024, the Centre and states collected over ₹21,000 crore in GST from health
insurance premiums
. In the last fiscal year alone, this figure was around ₹8,200 crore. States get half of this revenue, meaning they would lose around ₹4,100 crore if the GST on health insurance is reduced. Additionally, states receive 41% of the central GST, meaning a further dent in their finances if the tax rate is lowered.

The debate around the

Nitin Gadkari urged the Finance Ministry to scrap GST on health insurance
. In his letter, Gadkari highlighted the increasing financial burden on policyholders due to the consistent rise in insurance premiums, which often climb by 10 to 20 percent annually. This surge, he argued, adds strain on Indian citizens, particularly senior citizens, who are either retired or dependent on their savings for survival.

As medical costs continue to rise, many in India question why a service as essential as healthcare is taxed so heavily. In a country with significant income inequality and a healthcare system in need of improvement,
health insurance
is often seen as a necessity rather than a luxury. Despite this, India’s insurance penetration remains relatively low, and the added tax on health insurance only exacerbates the financial challenges faced by those seeking medical coverage.

States’ Reluctance to Cut GST on insurance
While there is pressure to reduce the GST on health insurance, several state governments remain opposed to the idea due to the potential revenue loss, ToI reportd. The GST fitment committee, which includes officers from both the Centre and the states, has been unable to reach an agreement on the matter. Many states fear that cutting the tax could result in a substantial drop in revenue, a concern made even more pressing by the fact that they no longer have the cushion of compensation from the Centre, which was previously offered when GST was introduced.
Between April 2021 and March 2024, the Centre and states collected over Rs 21,000 crore in GST from health insurance premiums. In the last fiscal year alone, this figure was estimated at Rs 8,200 crore. With the states receiving half of the GST revenue, they stand to lose around Rs 4,100 crore annually if the tax is cut. Furthermore, states also receive 41% of the central GST, meaning any reduction in the tax rate could further impact their finances.
States no longer have the safety net they once did, when they were open to tax cuts because the Centre would cover any revenue loss through the compensation cess, an official told ToI.

This financial strain has led even some of the strongest advocates for lower GST, such as West Bengal (ruled by the Trinamool Congress) and Karnataka (ruled by Congress), to publicly oppose changes to the current GST structure. These states fear that a tax cut would hurt their already strained budgets.
India’s Low Insurance Coverage
A report by Niti Aayog highlights the stark reality: nearly 30% of India’s population, or around 40 crore people, still lack any form of financial protection for healthcare. This lack of coverage leaves millions vulnerable to the high costs of medical treatment. The Economic Survey predicts that India’s insurance penetration, measured as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), will rise from 3.8% in FY23 to 4.3% by FY35. This growth is expected to be driven by the increasing demand for life insurance, particularly term policies, alongside the growth of Insurtech and a younger, more financially aware population.
Despite these optimistic forecasts, the current tax burden on health and life insurance remains a pressing issue for consumers. At present, these policies attract an 18% GST, a rate that many argue is too high for essential services.
Other Items on the Agenda at GST Meet
While the debate over GST on health and life insurance will likely dominate discussions, the Council will also address other key issues during Monday's meeting. One of these includes a status report on the taxation of online gaming, a subject that has sparked significant debate. Additionally, clarifications on GST regulations for branches of companies are expected to be discussed. This is particularly relevant for companies like
Infosys
, foreign airlines, and shipping firms, which have been hit with demands from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence.
As the
GST Council
gears up for what promises to be a critical meeting, all eyes will be on the discussions surrounding insurance tax relief. The outcome could have far-reaching implications for consumers, especially those seeking health insurance, as well as for state governments concerned about their revenue streams.

"General Insurance stake sale: Govt likely to earn Rs 4,700 crore from 6.8% divestment in GIC Re",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/general-insurance-stake-sale-govt-likely-to-earn-rs-4700-crore-from-6-8-divestment-in-gic-re/articleshow/113054668.cms,04-09-2024,"The government plans to sell a 6.8% stake in
General Insurance Corporation of India
(
GIC Re
) through an offer-for-sale. The shares will be priced at Rs 395 each, which is a 6% discount compared to Tuesday’s closing price. This move is expected to raise around Rs 4,700 crore, adding to the government's
disinvestment
fund for the year.
Since major strategic sales are limited, except for
IDBI Bank
, the government is likely to focus on smaller share sales to meet its target of Rs 50,000 crore in disinvestment for the current financial year. The share sale will be conducted over two days: non-retail investors can bid starting Wednesday, while retail investors and GIC Re employees can place their bids on Thursday.
Currently, the government owns about 85.8% of GIC Re, India’s only reinsurance company that helps insurers manage risk. This sale is part of the government’s strategy to follow regulatory guidelines and reduce its stake in public sector companies. GIC Re’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2017 was valued at Rs 11,176 crore. For comparison,
Coal India
raised Rs 22,400 crore through an offer-for-sale in 2015.
GIC Re’s market cap is Rs 73,904 crore, and at the floor price, the market value is Rs 69,298 crore. The government plans to offer nearly 6 crore shares, which is 3.4% of GIC’s total capital. There is an option to sell up to 11.95 crore shares if the oversubscription option is fully used.

Out of the total offer, 50,000 shares are reserved for GIC Re employees. Retail investors can bid at the floor price or a 'cut-off price,' which will be set based on the previous day's sales to non-retail investors.
At least 25% of the shares are set aside for mutual funds and insurance companies, while 10% are reserved for retail investors. The offer might be canceled if there are not enough bids above the floor price or if there are settlement issues. The sale will be available on both the BSE and NSE.
In Q1 FY25, GIC Re reported a 42% increase in net profit, reaching Rs 1,036 crore, up from Rs 731 crore last year. Gross premium income rose by 39% to Rs 12,406 crore from Rs 8,918 crore. However, investment income dropped by 21.5% to Rs 2,007 crore. The incurred claims ratio improved to 89.8% from 95.1%, and the combined ratio decreased to 109.6% from 118.5%.

View: India needs more lending — but not to everyone,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/view-india-needs-more-lending-but-not-to-everyone/articleshow/113046905.cms,04-09-2024,"Indians are justifiably proud of how easy it has become for them to pay for stuff. If you have an Indian phone number and bank account, instant
digital transactions
are fairly seamless. Now, the
Reserve Bank of India
wants to expand the country’s unified payments interface, or UPI, to lending: The central bank’s governor has repeatedly promised that a “unified
lending
interface” will soon be rolled out. That carries great potential — and not a little risk.
India’s model for financial interconnectedness is based around what it calls “digital public infrastructure.” The idea is simple: The government, or a closely regulated quasi-public entity, invests in, manages, and pays for the system through which digital transactions take place. Businesses can create apps that use this infrastructure; interoperability is built in, so those apps must compete on cost and quality rather than on the size of their network.
Consumers can decide how much of their information they are willing to share with specific apps or for specific transactions, and theoretically the seller’s access to private data is neither permanent nor very deep. The Indian IT whizzes who designed the system insist it avoids the worst of the US model (which is fragmented, insecure, and expensive), European systems (which are overregulated, lecture to business, and stifle innovation) and the Chinese network (which does not privilege privacy or allow for accountability to civil society).
Quite a bit of information has been put on India’s UPI, from educational certificates and medical history, to land records. Now that instant payments linked to bank accounts have been in use for years, there’s also a lot of financial data that could be put to work.
At least, that’s what the
RBI
hopes. Its governor argued that the availability of granular transfer data — as well as tax payments and land records — should make it easier for
financial institutions
to lend to farmers and small businesses that had previously struggled to access
credit

That task has been a constant headache for India’s financial policymakers. The formal banking system is dominated by the public sector, which lacks much of a profit motive and thus has deeply conservative lending practices.
When the government wants to juice lending, it creates schemes that target specific groups. Then the system switches to the other extreme, handing out cash to anyone and everyone without much discrimination.
That’s risky. Meanwhile, the private sector naturally doesn’t want to make the effort to enter a lending market dominated by borrowers with little access to collateral, minimal documentation, and few formal records.
Now those same borrowers have a paper trail on the various digital platforms that the government secures. Even the amount of milk sold to various cooperatives by individual dairy farmers is on there somewhere.
Getting that information to lenders in a way that incentivizes them to create a business model for small borrowers, while also protecting citizens’ data, is the problem the central bank claims to have solved.
The payoff could be vast. Indian small businesses typically do not grow larger — partly because of constraining regulation, but also because of differential access to credit. India’s unproductive agricultural sector, in particular, is short of capital investment and heavily dependent on public finance; it is both credit-hungry and lacks avenues to access cash on demand.
So, what’s the worry? Simply this: the potential impact on Indian household behavior.
Throughout India’s modern economic history,
household debt
has been pretty low. That’s slowly begun to change. According to the RBI, net household savings are at a 47-year low. In fact, they fell by two whole percentage points of GDP just between 2022 and 2023.
Indian households are stressed and borrowing more. The new system might make it much easier to take out collateral-free loans. The potential for this structural shift to become a macro risk is easy to see.
That isn’t enough of a reason to hold back
financial innovation
, especially if it might pay dividends in the longer term. But the government needs to be very watchful indeed for unintended consequences.
India has long boasted that its growth model has been led by demand and consumption. If increased consumer spending winds up leading to unsustainable household borrowing patterns, the economy will be in real trouble.

RBI's Michael Patra on what'll largely finance India's investment needs in coming decades,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-michael-patra-on-whatll-largely-finance-indias-investment-needs-in-coming-decades/articleshow/113018441.cms,03-09-2024,"Domestic savings
have been crucial in financing India's investment requirements and are expected to remain the predominant source of net lending in the coming decades, Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra said on September 3.
Patra shared these insights during the keynote address at the Financing 3.0 Summit: Preparing for Viksit Bharat, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) in Mumbai.
The main focus of the discussion was on the continuing significance of household savings in financing economic growth in India, the evolving financial landscape, and the respective roles of the private corporate sector and public sector in this dynamic. It also covered the importance of external financing while maintaining a strong policy focus on debt sustainability and leveraging India's demographic dividend to fuel future growth.
Patra explained that household net financial savings have significantly decreased from 2020-21 levels. This change is attributed to behavioural shifts, including the unwinding of prudential savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a move from financial assets to physical assets such as housing. Despite this decline, he noted that the trend is beginning to reverse.
""Going forward, boosted by rising incomes, households will likely build back their financial assets...This process has already begun. Households' financial assets have increased from 10.6 percent of GDP during 2011-17 to 11.5 percent during 2017-23 (excluding the pandemic year),"" Patra observed.

Post-pandemic behavioural change
Patra highlighted that physical savings by households have also seen an upsurge in the post-pandemic years, exceeding 12 percent of GDP and potentially increasing further. He observed that physical savings reached 16 percent of GDP in 2010-11.
""Accordingly, households will remain the top net lenders to the rest of the economy in the coming decades,"" he said.
Patra pointed out that the private corporate sector has notably decreased its net borrowings from the economy, a result of increased internal accruals and subdued capacity creation. However, he projected that the sector's need for borrowing might escalate with a revival in the capital expenditure (capex) cycle.
""These financing requirements will largely be met by households and external resources,"" he noted.
Regarding public sector financial behaviour, Patra noted that there has been a moderation in net dis-saving, albeit uneven. He emphasized that the public sector will continue to be a net borrower, considering the pivotal role of fiscal policy in shaping India's future economic landscape.
""If the nation, as a whole, has a deficit, it borrows from the rest of the world and the inflow of foreign savings helps finance its investment needs,"" he explained.
Main investment sources for India
Patra asserted that domestic savings have played a significant role in financing India's investment growth, with external financing serving as a supplementary source. This is demonstrated by the modest overall current account deficits.
""As the productive capacity of the economy rises and its ability to absorb foreign resources expands, the volume of external financing and its composition may undergo fundamental shifts, but in the light of past experiences, external debt sustainability will remain a policy priority,"" Patra said.
During his talk, Patra also highlighted India's advantageous demographic position. He emphasised the importance of a productive workforce for value creation and acknowledged the supportive role of capital.
CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee praised the performance of India's external sector. He underscored the role played by the
RBI
in ensuring that financial flows are stable, sustainable, and in harmony with the nation’s economic policies.
Banerjee noted, ""Greater investment can be useful to garner more financing in physical infrastructure, components for the digital economy, as well as emerging sectors like renewable energy, warehousing, semiconductor ecosystem, and data centres.""

"Despite increased Capex, Government on the path of fiscal prudence says Anand Rathi",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/despite-increased-capex-government-on-the-path-of-fiscal-prudence-says-anand-rathi/articleshow/112989388.cms,02-09-2024,"The central government is continuously moving on the path of
fiscal prudence
with the
fiscal deficit
of the government on July 24 declining to Rs 1.41 lakh crore as compared to Rs 1.54 lakh crore in the corresponding period last year, as per a report by Anand Rathi, a financial services company.
The report further highlights that the reduction in fiscal deficit is because of moderate growth in
tax revenues
and stable
government spending
. Over the first four months of the current fiscal year (April-July), the deficit stood at Rs 2.8 lakh crore, or 17.2 per cent of the estimated total, compared to Rs 6.1 lakh crore in the same period last year.
It added that the Government spending during these months was lower than last year, with
capital expenditure
down by 17.6 per cent year-on-year.
""In the first four months the fiscal deficit stood at Rs 2.8 trn (17.2 per cent of the estimate) compared to Rs 6.1 trn reported in the corresponding period last year"" said the report.
The report also noted that the personal income tax collections continued to perform strongly in July 2024, growing by 64 per cent year-on-year as the deadline for annual tax returns approached. So far, these collections have reached 33 per cent of the budgeted target for FY25.
Live Events
However, the corporate tax collections, which had briefly reversed a negative trend in June 2024, turned negative again, partly due to ongoing refunds.
The Indirect tax collections have improved, with customs duty revenues rising by up to 29 per cent year-on-year. Revenue from divestment has been stagnant, but non-tax revenues of the government have increased by 70 per cent year-on-year.
The report said ""Indirect tax collection growth recovered with robust customs duty collections which posted 29 per cent y/y growth. The receipts from divestment are currently stagnant., while the non-tax revenues are up by 70 per cent y/y""
As per the report the total government spending in the first four months recovered to 27 per cent of the budgeted target. While monthly revenue expenditure decreased by 14 per cent year-on-year in July 2024, capital expenditure however rebounded with a 108 per cent year-on-year growth.
But, despite this rebound, capital spending by the government remains 18 per cent lower in the first four months of the fiscal year. The model code of conduct during the first two months of the year has slowed spending and the recovery after the elections has been limited, pending the full-year budget announcement.
The report says expenditure is expected to pick up as funds are released following the approval of the finance bill by the Parliament.
The strong growth in personal income tax collections and a record dividend payment of Rs 2.11 lakh crore by the RBI have improved the fiscal situation, potentially offsetting any shortfalls from divestment collections, which have yet to gain momentum.
With the strong revenue performance, the report suggests, the government is unlikely to alter its borrowing programme, as it plans to maintain robust spending to support the infrastructure and social schemes.

"India's growth prospects bright, but must avoid financialization, says CEA V Anantha Nageswaran",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-needs-to-avoid-financialization-as-it-marches-towards-viksit-bharat-goal-says-nageswaran/articleshow/112987916.cms,02-09-2024,"India
is well-positioned for strong global
economic growth
, but the country must be cautious of
financialization
as it progresses towards becoming a developed nation by 2047, Chief Economic Advisor (
CEA
) V Anantha
Nageswaran
said on Monday. Speaking at the
CII
Financing 3.0 Summit in Mumbai, Nageswaran highlighted the risks of an oversized financial market influencing public policy and economic outcomes, a trend that he believes India should avoid.
India's
stock market
capitalization currently stands at approximately 140 percent of its GDP. Nageswaran noted that the growing profitability of the financial sector and high levels of
market capitalization
require closer scrutiny. ""When the market becomes bigger than the economy, it is natural, but not necessarily reasonable, that the market’s considerations dominate public discourse and influence policy,"" he warned.
Nageswaran defined financialization as the dominance of financial markets over public policy and macroeconomic outcomes. Citing the experience of developed countries, he said financialization has led to unprecedented public and private debt levels, economic growth reliant on rising asset prices, and increased inequality. ""India must be wary of these outcomes and avoid this trap,"" he urged.
As India steps into the lower middle-income category, Nageswaran emphasized that the country cannot afford the financialization and its consequences that are affecting advanced economies. He stressed the importance of retaining policy autonomy to protect the economy from the instability of global capital flows.
Looking ahead, Nageswaran called for a balance between national economic priorities and investor interests. He also encouraged India to aspire to become a global agenda setter rather than an agenda taker. ""Economic size and clout will influence our ability to set the global agenda, which in turn will impact our economic performance,"" he said, adding that while some actions can be initiated now, their outcomes may take time to materialize.

Large offshore investment write-offs trigger RBI alert,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/large-offshore-investment-write-offs-trigger-rbi-alert/articleshow/112974481.cms,02-09-2024,"Mumbai: Large write-offs of
overseas investments
are raising the hackles of the regulator. About half a dozen companies have drawn the Reserve Bank of India's attention in the past few months for significantly-and, sometimes abruptly-reducing the value of their offshore investments. The banking regulator, which has the last word on cross-border fund flows, sources said, suspects that such overseas investments were not genuine business decisions in the first place, and were simply a subterfuge to move money abroad.
The 'overseas direct investment' (ODI) route was used to transfer large amounts which could not have been remitted under other
foreign exchange regulations
.
""Overseas investment is permitted for bona fide
business purposes
abroad. Further, there are additional conditions such as continuing the investment for at least one year prior to disinvestment. Cognizance of such matters has been taken recently and a closer review is being done in case of unusual erosion in value,"" said Moin Ladha, partner at the law firm Khaitan & Co.
Since a company can remit up to four times its net worth as ODI, the amount that company promoters can shift outside could be considerably more than the yearly limit of $250,000 a resident individual can invest abroad in securities and properties under RBI's liberalised
remittance
scheme (LRS).
Live Events
RBI is doing whatever it can to verify whether all overseas subsidiaries or joint ventures are engaged in bona fide businesses-more so, as many have used this vehicle in the past to do things that are not permitted directly, said Rajesh P Shah, partner at Jayantilal Thakkar and Company, a CA firm specialising in foreign exchange regulations. ""So, RBI is making companies go through all the checks, like various disclosures including mandatory audit of overseas subsidiaries,"" said Shah.
Exits trigger standard procedures such as submission of transfer-related documents, valuation confirmation from a local agency, the rationale for exit and a comparison between the original investment amount and the expected realisation amount.
""The regulator's suspicion is stoked when large write-downs are shown within just a few years of the investments. For ODI the Indian investor entity must have a track record and net worth, but there are instances where such entities are leveraged and the possibility of fund diversion cannot be ruled out,"" said Mitil Chokshi, senior partner at the tax, advisory and forensic firm Chokshi & Chokshi.
Under the new overseas
investment rules
which came into force from August 2022, a write-off can be initiated by the company automatically.
The recent cases that have come under regulatory glare relate to ODI deals prior to 2022.
But professionals like Harshal Bhuta, whose firm PR Bhuta & Co is advising the write-off of an US subsidiary with the business proving to be unsustainable, think that any business suffering losses should not be suspected as sham investment. ""There are checks in place at various stages to ensure that the investment made in an overseas entity is towards bona fide purposes. Indian entities have to submit valuation reports,
investment evidence
, annual performance reports and other documents to authorised dealer banks which have to satisfy themselves about the genuineness of the investment/disinvestment. Additionally, in any investment/disinvestment case requiring RBI approval, the bank has to submit its comments or recommendations to the RBI,"" said Bhuta.
There are situations where an overseas investee entity must follow the closure process in the foreign country, entailing liquidation and a no-objection certificate from overseas authorities. This can be time-consuming-while the procedure is comparatively simpler in jurisdictions such as the US, UK, and UAE, a more detailed explanation is sought by countries like Belgium, Singapore, and South Africa. ""Now, justifications for losses are accepted by the local jurisdiction, the same could be accepted by Indian authorities too,"" felt Chokshi.

In April, the total GST mop-up surged to a record high of Rs 2.10 lakh crore.
""The
August 2024 GST
collections reflect the resilience and robustness of India's tax framework. The consistent year-on-year growth of around 10 percent underscores the effectiveness of ongoing GST reforms and compliance measures. The significant rise in import revenue highlights the buoyancy in the external sector, while the strong domestic collections, affirm the continued momentum in the economy,"" said Mahesh Jaising, Partner and Leader, Indirect Tax, Deloitte India on recent GST mop-up.
Live Events
In August 2024, domestic revenue grew 9.2 per cent to about Rs 1.25 lakh crore. Gross GST revenues from import of goods were up 12.1 per cent to Rs 49,976 crore.

After adjusting refunds, net GST revenue increase was 6.5 per cent at Rs 1.5 lakh crore during the month under review.
The GST council is likely to meet on September 9 or later where Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman led- panel will discuss rationalisation of tax rates but a final decision on tweaking taxes and slabs will be taken later. She also said that compensation cess on luxury and sin goods are also going to be discussed in the upcoming meeting.
""The upcoming GST Council meeting on September 9th will be crucial in further refining the tax structure, especially with potential decisions on ease of doing business. The government's continued efforts in maintaining this trajectory are commendable, ensuring sustained revenue streams that contribute to the nation's economic stability,"" said Jaising on upcoming GST council meet.
The panel also tasked the fitment committee -- a group of tax officers -- to analyse the implication of tinkering rates on some items and present them before the GST council.
GST was introduced on July 1, 2017, and states were assured of compensation for the revenue loss till June 2022, arising on account of the GST rollout.

The size of digital lending is expected to be over $1 Trillion by 2030, according to a BCG report, and most of the loans will be disbursed using AI.
“We use AI for multiple use cases, especially in the collection phase, where the algorithm classifies a person according to their borrower behaviour. About 15% of our borrowers are classified in the low, medium, high-risk category, where we can intervene and take the process forward”, said Harshvardhan Lunia, CEO, Lendingkart.
Responsible borrowers are important, especially when the nation is young, and regional languages play an important role when it comes to pushing financial literacy contents, said Lunia.
Even the RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday said that AI/ML are poised to revolutionise financial services in unprecedented ways. “AI algorithms are already being deployed for fraud detection. Machine learning models are increasingly being employed in credit scoring, leveraging predictive analytics to assess creditworthiness, and expand access to credit,” Das had said. “As AI and ML capabilities continue to evolve, their potential applications in
regulatory compliance
, investment advisory services, and algorithmic trading are expected to further redefine the financial landscape,” he said.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das' 5-point agenda for India’s financial future at GFF 2024,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-5-point-agenda-for-indias-financial-future-at-gff-2024/articleshow/112870052.cms,29-08-2024,"At the
Global Fintech Festival
(GFF) 2024 in Mumbai, Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
Governor Shaktikanta Das
delivered a compelling address highlighting India’s transformation into a fast-growing economic powerhouse. Das attributed this growth to the country's tech-savvy population and an increasingly dynamic
fintech
ecosystem. In his speech, he outlined five strategic priorities that are essential for shaping the future of India's financial landscape.
1. Financial Inclusion
Governor Das began by celebrating the significant advancements in
financial inclusion
across the country. He pointed out that the RBI’s Financial Inclusion Index has risen from 53.9 in March 2021 to 64.2 in March 2024. Central to this progress has been the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, a flagship financial inclusion initiative that has completed a decade of success. Under this scheme, over 530 million bank accounts have been opened, with 66% of them in rural and semi-urban areas, and 55% benefiting women.
“Jan Dhan accounts, despite initial skepticism, have demonstrated significant savings accumulation,” Das remarked, emphasizing the scheme's tangible impact on the lives of millions. Looking ahead, he stressed the importance of leveraging technology over the next two decades to address the financial needs of underserved regions. He highlighted the crucial role that fintech companies will play in bridging gaps and ensuring seamless access to financial services.
2. Enhancing Digital Public Infrastructure
The second priority outlined by Das was the enhancement of
Digital Public Infrastructure
(DPI), which he identified as a key driver in integrating advanced technologies into India's financial system. He discussed the RBI's pilot project on the Unique Lending Interface (ULI), which is set to be launched on a full scale soon. This initiative, combined with the existing JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) trinity and UPI, represents a new era in India’s financial journey.
“DPI has the potential to revolutionize financial services in India,” Das asserted, highlighting the transformative impact that these initiatives will have on the financial landscape. By streamlining access to financial products and services, DPI is expected to bring about greater financial inclusion and efficiency across the country.

3. Strengthening Cybersecurity
In an increasingly digital world,
cybersecurity
has emerged as a critical pillar in safeguarding India’s financial ecosystem. Das emphasized the importance of real-time monitoring and regulatory compliance, especially in light of the recently enacted Digital Personal Data Protection Act. This legislation empowers individuals with greater control over their data, thereby enhancing trust in digital financial services.
“Banks and fintech firms, particularly NBFCs, are expected to adopt a customer-centric approach, ensuring transparency in financial products and fair lending practices,” Das stated. He also stressed the need for continuous vigilance against cyber threats and the importance of promoting cybersecurity awareness to build a secure digital economy.
4. Promoting Long-Term Sustainable Finance
Das then turned his attention to the importance of long-term
sustainable finance
. He highlighted the RBI’s initiatives, such as sovereign green bonds and green deposits, as steps towards promoting sustainability within the financial sector. However, he acknowledged the challenges of scalability in this area, noting that the green bond market requires further expansion.
“Technology, particularly artificial intelligence and big data, will play a transformative role in assessing environmental risks and accelerating the transition to sustainable finance,” Das explained. He emphasized the pivotal role that fintech companies are expected to play in driving this transition over the next two decades, positioning India as a leader in sustainable finance.
5. Reinforcing Financial Infrastructure
Finally, Das underscored the need to strengthen India’s
financial infrastructure
, with a particular focus on cross-border payments. He emphasized the RBI’s ongoing efforts to make UPI and RuPay truly global, highlighting this as a key agenda moving forward.
“We must adopt artificial intelligence carefully and in a calibrated manner, understanding both its potential and the risks it poses,” Das cautioned. He also pointed to the Internet of Things (IoT) as the next frontier of opportunity for the financial sector, underscoring the importance of innovation in reinforcing India’s financial infrastructure.
The Global Fintech Festival (GFF) 2024, held in Mumbai, provided a platform for industry leaders, policymakers, and innovators to discuss the future of fintech in India. As one of the fastest-growing economies globally, India has seen a surge in fintech startups, with over 11,000 companies founded and $6 billion in funding secured over the last three years. This growth is indicative of the country's broader economic trajectory, driven by a young and tech-savvy population eager to embrace digital financial services.
Governor Das’s address at the GFF 2024 was a reflection of the RBI’s strategic vision for India’s financial future, emphasizing the need for innovation, inclusion, and resilience in the financial system. The priorities he outlined are set against the backdrop of India’s broader economic goals, which include achieving financial inclusion for all, fostering sustainable growth, and positioning the country as a global leader in fintech.

States are also cautious on GST rate cuts: FM Sitharaman,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/states-are-also-cautious-on-gst-rate-cuts-fm-sitharaman/articleshow/112857718.cms,28-08-2024,"Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
on Tuesday said that even states were cautious on moving ahead with rate cuts.
""I am not blaming them...they want revenue without burdening the people...when they sit there, they know their job is not to please anyone but protect revenue,"" she told reporters.
The comments come amid discussions to rework the rates on goods and services, which Sitharaman indicated will take some time. The
GST Council
is expected to kick off the debate in its meeting on September 9.
In recent months, the Centre has faced criticism for high
GST
rates, but Sitharaman countered it, saying that on almost all goods and services rates were lower than July 2017, when the new regime kicked in after subsuming several taxes and cesses.
""There is a lot of vicious, false campaign on social media. I won't get into that... the entire country is benefiting from GST,"" she said, explaining that apart from rates, border checks have been removed making goods movement smoother and faster.

She also said that revenue neutral rate has now come below 11.6%, the level estimated in 2019, against 15.3% recommended by an expert panel before GST launch in 2017.
The group of ministers on rate rationalisation, led by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, has decided to recommend that the four slabs - 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% - should be left unchanged even as it looks at reworking other rates.
Sitharaman said contrary to impression that is created, state FMs and the Centre discuss issues in a very congenial manner and a decision is taken after detailed deliberations. FM also said that compensation cess on luxury and
sin goods
are also going to be discussed. While cess was to end in 2022, the requirement of states to meet their spending requirements led to the GST Council agreeing to extend it up to March 2026 to repay the borrowings. Govt officials expect the 2.7 lakh crore borrowings to be repaid by Nov 2025.

RBI looks to soften blow of tighter infrastructure funding rules,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-looks-to-soften-blow-of-tighter-infrastructure-funding-rules/articleshow/112816747.cms,27-08-2024,"The
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) is contemplating a staggered
implementation
of the increase in provisioning for
project financing
to soften the blow on
lenders
and give them ample time to prepare for any impact on
profitability
. Projects nearing completion may also be given some leeway in
provisions
, people familiar with
RBI
's plans said.
Facing flak from both lenders and the finance ministry, the
central bank
is treading a cautious line to ensure that the new norms don't lead to any cost escalation, making projects unviable. However, it is determined to increase provisioning for such projects and implement them across regulated entities to plug emerging risks from a sector notorious for its delays.
""As of now, the thinking is to implement these norms slowly, staggering the provisions, so that lenders' profit margins are not vastly impacted. Project finance lenders will be given enough time with due care taken to ensure funding for projects is not impacted,"" said a person directly aware of RBI's thinking. To be sure, the draft guidelines released in May said all regulated entities need to make 5% provisions in a phased manner when a project is in construction phase.
Big increase
A three-year path has been proposed to achieve this: 2% in fiscal 2025, 3.5% in fiscal 2026 and 5% by 2027. It substantially increases provisions from the flat 0.4% standard asset provisions on project loans currently.
Live Events
The central bank's thinking is to delay either the onset of these provisions by a year or increase the number of years to make the full provision. However, that decision has not yet been made, said the person cited above. ""For projects that are a few months away from being operational, some sought of waiver may be allowed on a case-to-case basis,"" this person said.
A spokesperson for RBI did not reply to an email seeking comment.
The draft norms say that for projects where the date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) is cumulatively deferred for more than two years and one year for infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects, respectively, lenders shall maintain additional specific provisions of 2.5% over and above the applicable standard asset provision.
Lenders are, however, more perturbed by the norms which say that the provisions will have to be made retrospectively even in projects where the loan was given earlier. Besides banks, infrastructure finance companies like Power Finance Corp and Rural Electrification Corp, which together have amassed more than Rs 15 lakh crore of loans, are likely to be most impacted.
""Staggered implementation is good, but the rise in provisions will ultimately impact profitability and make financing these projects unviable. This is in total contrast to the government's push for infrastructure,"" said a senior banking official.
Financial executives said the sharp backlash from both lenders as well as the finance ministry has led to a rethink in the RBI. ""The government has asked a lot of questions in the last couple of months. The main point is RBI guidelines do not make a distinction between a hybrid annuity model (HAM) and a toll model or even a solar project. The risks for all three are different. The probability of default that the RBI has calculated is also on the higher side, which means solar projects which depend on debt financing, for example, will surely feel the pressure,"" said another financial sector executive.
Unlike a private sector-maintained toll road, a HAM project involves participation of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), reducing its risk substantially. Also, solar energy is an important part of the government infrastructure plan which envisages a total investment of more than Rs 11 lakh crore this fiscal. Financial executives said discouraging infrastructure lending will have a direct impact on the government's 7% economic growth target for this fiscal.

One-time UPS allocation won't have big impact on fiscal math,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/one-time-ups-allocation-wont-have-big-impact-on-fiscal-math/articleshow/112787289.cms,26-08-2024,"Assured pensions
under the newly introduced
Unified Pension Scheme
(UPS) may require a significant one-time allocation in FY25, but that may not significantly impact the government's fiscal math in the years ahead, said economists.
The major budget impact of UPS will come from the increased
monthly contribution
by the government - 18.5% of the basic and dearness allowance (DA), compared with 14% at present.
""The union government's contribution is likely to increase by 32.1% from the NPS (
National Pension System
) and could be around ₹40,000-45,000 crore in FY25,"" said DK Pant, chief economist at India Ratings.
This increase is due to the government's commitment to paying arrears to employees who retired earlier.
Live Events
""
Pension liabilities
in the union budget may increase by 20% from the FY25 budgeted amount of ₹2,43,296 crore. Going forward annual increase is likely to reduce to ₹10,000-15,000 crore,"" he added.
According to Aditi Nayar, chief economist at
ICRA
, the UPS will reduce the uncertainty for employees, but the fact that the government will provide an assured pension will add to the government's committed expenditures in the future.
""This will have to be built into the
fiscal consolidation roadmap
going ahead,"" she said.
The UPS is much like the
Old Pension Scheme
(OPS) in terms of benefits. However, in the case of OPS the liabilities were unfunded and paid out of the budget. In the case of UPS, two funds will be created to meet the future payouts.
The government's liability could, however, increase if the returns from the pension corpus are not sufficient to provide the minimum assured pension and the dearness relief.
The union cabinet gave its nod to the UPS Saturday, proposing an assured pension of 50% of the average basic salary drawn over the 12 months preceding superannuation for those completing at least 25 years of service.
The new scheme will offer a minimum pension of ₹10,000 a month and will be inflation-adjusted.
Pant from India Ratings, however, argued that there will be ""nil or insignificant impact"" on the government exchequer on account of the corpus increase required to meet the minimum 50% pension guaranteed under UPS.

The move brings cheer to foreign shipping lines, such as
Maersk
, Orient Overseas Container Line Ltd and Hapag Lloyd Mediterranean Shipping, who were facing notices for non-payment of goods and services tax (
GST
) on
import of services
from July 2017 onwards.
The tax demand was dropped after the shipping companies gave a joint undertaking that there was no import of services in 2017-18, the people said.
However, the tax demand for subsequent years will stay, they said.
Live Events
The DGGI had in October 2023 started investigation into allegations that the branch offices of foreign shipping companies and foreign airlines in India had not paid GST under the
reverse charge mechanism
for services such as rental, maintenance of aircraft and salary paid of crew abroad.
The agency also sought detailed clarifications from these companies, while raising tax demand for the period from July 1, 2017, to March 2024. The DGGI, in February this year, also sent out summons to all the foreign shipping lines operating in India.
After receiving summons from the DGGI Ahmedabad and DGGI Mumbai, these companies jointly approached the finance ministry. They also provided a break-up for the import of services to the DGGI.
""This exemption is only for the financial year 2017-18 and will not apply to the subsequent years for which the investigation is on,"" said one of the officials, who did not wish to be identified.
The fitment committee of the
GST Council
will decide on the exemption for subsequent years and also whether the import of services by such companies was taxable.

Gross inflows had risen by approximately 23% in the previous quarter, despite a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) over the last two financial years, which the government attributed to weak sentiments in developed markets.

to consider waiving off the Goods and Services Tax imposed on life and

GST on insurance
products.
""I want to raise two important points - tax has been there on medical insurance even before the introduction of GST. There was already a pre-GST tax on medical insurance, before the GST was introduced. This is not a new issue, it was already there in all the states. Those protesting here... did they discuss regarding the removal of this tax in their states?""

'Remove 18% GST on insurance'
The demands for

as one of her colleagues, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, demanded so in a letter. Sitharaman later said
the letter wasn’t meant to be public

Nonetheless, in a country that has high income inequality and healthcare infrastructure needs further major boost, Indians are debating why they should be taxed for something that is associated as a necessity - healthcare. The insurance penetration rate in India is far lower compared to many other nations and tax is an added cost that citizens need to bear if they want to buy medical insurance.
A report by the Niti Aayog said that 30 percent of the population, around 40 crore Indians, still lack any form of financial protection for health.
The Economic Survey forecasts that insurance penetration, measured as a percentage of GDP, will rise from 3.8% in FY23 to 4.3% by FY35. At the same time, life insurance premiums are expected to grow at an annual rate of 6.7% between 2024 and 2028. This growth is driven by increasing demand for term life insurance, a younger population, and advancements in Insurtech.
Health insurance: The question of affordability

Parthanil Ghosh, Director and Chief Business Officer at
HDFC ERGO
General Insurance, told ET Online that although the tax structure has been simplified since the introduction of GST in 2017, the affordability factor has become an adverse issue for policyholders.
“While the single rate has ensured that the tax structure for policyholders is simplified and transparent, the affordability factor has been negatively impacted as it has made health insurance premiums costlier by the GST amount,” Ghosh explained.

Ghosh, however, highlighted a silver lining: “With Input Tax Credit available on the GST paid by the insurer, the net impact of GST is comparatively lower than that under Service Tax for some non-life insurance products.”

“Insurance companies determine the gross premiums based on the expected cost of claims and associated expenses. These premiums include the applicable GST. Thus, an insurance policy with a premium of Rs 15,000 will have an additional cost of Rs 2,700 (Rs 15,000 * 18%). The input tax credit availed by an insurance company against the services procured ensures that these costs are not passed onto the policyholders,” he said.
Insurance Samadhan
’s COO and co-founder Shilpa Arora argues that the amount of GST imposed on premiums is ‘not justified.’
“GST of 18% is not justified on premiums. Insurance products are bought to safeguard families against financial losses due to early death or illness. Where IRDAI is talking about insurance for all by 2047, the government should reduce the GST to make premiums more affordable,” Arora told ET Online.
Star Health didn’t respond to ET Online’s query.
Indians' reluctance to buy insurance
Premiums on insurance often increase by 10 to 20 per cent, thus adding to the financial strain on the policy buyer. This annual surge in premiums adds to the cost burden for Indians and particularly affects senior citizens, especially ones who have retired and may be depending on savings for survival.
“In India, where around 40 crore people have no financial protection for health, it is a matter of worry, especially in the case of senior citizens, who may need a high sum insured and thus bear the significant brunt of the GST rate,” said HDFC Ergo’s Ghosh.
18% GST removal can bring down health insurance costs
Shilpa Arora weighed in on this sentiment and said that if the government decides to reduce GST on insurance, it would help bring down premium prices too.
“In life insurance, if an endowment product is bought, the customer pays Rs 59,000 as a premium, but the investment will be considered as Rs 50,000 (with further mortality charges and expenses deducted), and Rs 9,000 being the GST element. This results in lower returns because the policyholder calculates the total price paid and the return he has received. He often feels cheated and loses trust in insurance products. We receive many complaints where health insurance premiums have increased significantly, and the policyholder is asking for relief. Here we cannot do much, but the government can definitely help by reducing the GST percentage,” Arora explained.
GST withdrawal on health insurance: A real possibility?
Taxes are what help run a nation. Asking for a tax exemption seems to be a challenging proposition in a developing country like India. Experts believe that reduced or exempted taxes would have a positive ripple effect on citizens. But what impact would such an exemption have on insurers?
“If GST is exempted on insurance premiums, then insurance companies would not be able to avail input tax credit (ITC) on the GST paid by the insurance company, and thus, it might not truly benefit the policyholders,” Ghosh said.
Shilpa Arora, on the other hand, welcomed any future prospects of a possible exemption from taxes on life and health insurance.
“This will make premiums more affordable; people can buy better coverages. The returns of life products will improve,” she said.
Ghosh offered a different solution.
If the GST rate is set at 0% or any rate lower than the current rate of 18% instead of exempted, then the benefit equivalent to the ITC credit availed would still be passed on to customers, and this is expected to result in lower premiums for the customer,” Ghosh stated.
Can GST removal in insurance help improve low percentage of insurance penetration?
India’s insurance penetration has increased from 3.9 percent in 2013-14 to 4 percent between 2022-23, according to Financial Services Secretary Vivek Joshi. Though the insurance industry has seen an influx of people investing in life and health insurance plans, awareness of insurance remains low in India compared to other nations.
Ghosh said that various factors contribute to the slow growth in insurance penetration.
“Affordability of health indemnity policies and financial literacy are major hurdles, as many people are unaware of the benefits of insurance in the country. With lower affordability, consumers are difficult to convince on indemnity policies. There is also a lack of customised products and lower trust in insurance policies.”
What lower health insurance premium can do
Insurance Samadhan’s Arora stated that a decrease in premiums would help encourage more investments in life and health insurance policies. She agreed that an easier tax regime would help increase the percentage of policyholders.
“Lower premiums will result in increased coverage and also reduce the lapsation of policies in later years. We strongly feel that 18 per cent is too high for an essential product for every Indian family,” Arora said.
India’s insurance penetration percentage reveals that many people don’t sign up for insurance. Experts associate this low percentage with two crucial factors: medical inflation and the absence of a healthcare regulator.
“The absence of a healthcare regulator has resulted in over 10% annual medical inflation, which in turn makes health insurance premiums costlier. In fact, post-COVID, we have observed medical inflation rising steeply coupled with modern technology costs, resulting in an increase in health insurance premiums,” Ghosh elaborated.
Moreover, he said that “in order to propel insurance penetration in India, it is essential to adopt a multi-faceted approach and complement it with other factors such as a strong distribution network, innovative products and services, and a seamless claims experience to increase insurance awareness.”
Moment of truth: Insurance claim rejections
GST may be one of the problems when it comes to Indians’ reluctance to invest in insurance policies. Another significant reason for this reluctance can be linked to the increased percentage of rejected insurance claims.
A survey conducted by Local Circles showed that at least 43 per cent of insurance claims have either been partially approved or rejected in the last three years.
The survey cited the experiences of several policyholders, who revealed the challenges they faced while applying for an insurance claim.
“From insurance companies rejecting claims by classifying a health condition as a pre-existing condition to only approving a partial amount, 43 per cent of health insurance policyholders who filed a claim in the last three years struggled with getting it processed,” the report said.
“The insurance industry experiences significant fraud in the reimbursement mode, leading to high rejection rates,” countered HDFC Ergo’s Ghosh.
Shilpa Arora acknowledged that an insurance claim’s rejection does have a negative impact on policyholders.
“Insurance claim rejection does break the trust of the policyholder because the moment of trust for an insurance product is the claim. A lot is being done by IRDAI to improve the policyholder experience like the new health insurance guidelines and the revamped grievance mechanism,” Arora said.

Brookfield Corporation, one of the largest investment management companies globally, is slated to hold meetings with Naidu and government officials on Tuesday to take forward various investments in the state.
Apart from this, the Oberoi group has decided to set up five hotels in Amravati, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Gandikota and Horsely Hills. While sites have been identified at four locations, the government is yet to identify land in Amravati.
The Naidu government is looking at private investments to re-energise the state economy and deliver its poll promise of providing 20 lakh jobs over the next five years. Official data shows Andhra Pradesh's public debt has risen from 31.02 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in 2019-20 to 33.32 per cent in 2023-24, indicating worsening fiscal health over the last five years. In the recently-concluded Assembly session in July, Naidu said the government would take two more months to present the Budget due to ""financial constraints.""
On Monday, Naidu was in Tirupati to inaugurate projects and sign memorandums of understanding for investment worth ₹3,700 crore.

Outward remittances exceeding ₹6 lakh come under I-T scanner,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/outward-remittances-exceeding-6-lakh-come-under-i-t-scanner/articleshow/112476025.cms,13-08-2024,"New Delhi: The
Central Board of Direct Taxes
(CBDT) has launched a comprehensive scrutiny and verification of high-value outward
foreign remittances
of above ₹6 lakh to identify discrepancies in remittance data and likely
tax evasion
.
The move follows detection of cases where foreign remittances and expenditures did not align with the income declared by individuals, and lapses in tax collected at source (
TCS
), ET has learnt.
The board has asked the field formations to start the verification process and scrutiny of
Form 15CC
- a quarterly disclosure statement of outward remittances filed by authorised dealers to the income-tax department, officials aware of the development said.
The Form 15CC data was being collected and segregated since 2016 and it will be available for analysis from this year, they said.
""A comprehensive review was recommended last year... This will (soon) be made available to field formations for the first time,"" a senior official told ET.
Live Events
The move will help the government to identify cases where the remittance was sent but was not reported by the taxpayer in their filling, the official said.
""The whole exercise will curb tax evasion and ensure that legitimate remittances are facilitated while preventing abuse of relaxations in foreign remittance reporting,"" the official added.
The board will prepare a list of high-risk cases based on scrutiny of data from 2020-21 onwards.
It has directed the field formations to frame a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) to detect high-risk cases and to submit a list of such cases latest by September 30.
The government has set a deadline of December 31 for sending first notices to those identified as having undeclared income.
Elaborating on the irregularities, the official quoted above said that in one case, an individual with declared annual income of ₹5 lakh is found to have sent ₹15 lakh abroad in the last three years, using three different dealers so that it will not attract mandatory TCS and escape the tax net.
The government collects 20% TCS on foreign remittances of above Rs 7 lakh under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), with some exceptions on medical and education expenditure.
Under the foreign remittance reporting through Form 15CC, if the remitter, or deductor, certifies that the remittance is not taxable, no further details are required - for instance, payments by importers, by companies to their subsidiaries, or loans to non-residents.
However, officials said, the department has detected some cases of potential misuse of this relaxation.
""Monitoring these payments where exemption is claimed is crucial to prevent abuse of these relaxations,"" said the official quoted above.
The CBDT has already asked banks to report total forex spends as a distinct category, in addition to total credit card spends, even when they are not collecting TCS. This data is being recorded in annual income statement, used to assess the income tax. The government had raised TCS on foreign remittances under LRS to 20% from 5% starting October 1, 2023.
The budget 2023 had also brought international credit card payments under the ambit of LRS and implemented TCS on such transactions. However, it was later rolled back following wide criticism.

Most of these guarantees are given budgetary support for repayment of their liabilities by the State government. Further investment is made by the State in the Guarantee Redemption Fund (which is managed by the Reserve Bank of India) to meet any exigencies. Till date no claim has been raised from this fund. There is negligible potential risk to State’s financial stability due to contingent liabilities.

Normalcy returning to household saving behaviour: RBI Dy Guv Michael Patra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/normalcy-returning-to-household-saving-behaviour-rbi-dy-guv-michael-patra/articleshow/112380237.cms,08-08-2024,"Reserve Bank
Deputy Governor Michael Patra on Thursday said
household saving behaviour
is returning to ""normalcy"" now. Drawing from official data, he said there is not a lot of exposure to
equities
among the households.
The households had saved higher proportions in
financial assets
during the pandemic both as a precautionary measure and as the avenues to spend had dried up, and with the ebbing of Covid, there has been a propensity to invest more in
physical assets
, he said.
""If you take both of them together, then the total household savings have stabilized at around 20 per cent. It was falling for quite a while and now it is stabilized. All in all, I see a return of normalcy in household saving behaviour,"" he told reporters here.
It can be noted that concerns were raised about the
net financial savings
dropping to 5.3 per cent, an over four-decade low in FY23 recently.
Meanwhile, Governor Shaktikant Das advised banks to use their branch networks to ensure that they get sufficient deposits to sustain and support their
credit growth

"RBI's stance provides elbow room to check inflation, aid growth: Experts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-stance-provides-elbow-room-to-check-inflation-aid-growth-experts/articleshow/112376425.cms,08-08-2024,"The
Reserve Bank
's decision to keep interest rate unchanged will provide it an elbow room to continue focus on moderating inflation for resilient and sustained
economic growth
, said industry experts. For the ninth time in a row, the central bank decided to continue the status quo and kept the benchmark repo rate at 6.5 per cent.
Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist,
Bank of Baroda
said the
RBI
has quite unambiguously stated that the focus would be on headline inflation and that one cannot ignore food inflation, especially if it is persistent.
""This indicates that while inflation will come down in Q2, it will rise in Q3, and one cannot take a rate cut for granted in future. Any decision will be data-driven and hence a calibrated call will be taken. The picture may not be very clear in October and hence any change in policy and stance could be more likely not before December,"" Sabnavis said.
Commenting on the RBI's decision to keep the benchmark rate unchanged, industry body Assocham said it has come about in the wake of robust GDP prospects of 7.2 per cent in 2024-25 providing elbow room to the central bank to continue with its focus on moderating inflation for a resilient and sustained economic growth.
""The message in the RBI monetary policy is to keep price stability at the top of its priority list with an objective of sustained economic growth. We see convergence in these two objectives even as there is an expectation of change in stance towards 'accommodation' in the next one or two policy reviews,"" said Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood.

Sanjeev Agrawal, President, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, ""The status quo stance of the monetary policy, amidst continuing geopolitical crises and strong domestic macroeconomic fundamentals is welcome.""
Ranen Banerjee, partner and leader, economic advisory, PwC India said the continued pause in the policy rate and sticking with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation was expected given the RBI Governor's earlier statements.
""There is no pressing need for any action on the policy rate as the yields on 10-year paper have already softened by almost 20bps owing to the index-linked flows. There is still volatility in food prices and risk of food inflation that will keep the CPI elevated above 4 per cent in FY25,"" he said.
In his comment, Nikhil Gupta, Chief Economist, MOFSL Group said what probably was more important was the Governor's emphasis on the headline inflation and the focus on inflation deceleration when growth remains so good.
""This, to our mind, indicates that rate cuts are not coming anytime soon (unless growth falters),"" Gupta added.
The RBI also announced several measures on payment and lending fronts, including steps to speed up cheque clearance and increasing frequency of reporting to CICs.
Anil Gupta, Senior Vice President,
ICRA Ltd
said given the ease of credit availability through digital processes, the leveraging and the credit profile of the borrowers can change quickly and faster reporting by lenders to credit bureaus will help in improved decision-making by the lenders.
Angad Bedi, managing director, BCD Group said the RBI's decision to maintain the status quo on the repo rate underscores the central bank's commitment to stability and prudence in India's economic landscape.
""This approach is expected to keep EMIs at a manageable level and borrowing costs predictable, which will benefit homebuyers and house loan borrowers. The real estate sector is poised to benefit from this steady stance, leading to an increase in sales and investments, thereby fostering economic growth,"" Bedi said.
Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com welcomed RBI's step to set up a repository of digital lending apps.
""It is a move that will help consumers identify fake apps and encourage them to use only legitimate digital lending apps. Only regulated entities will be permitted to report and update info about the digital lending apps whose services they are availing,"" Shetty said.
CFO of BPTP Manik Malik said the RBI's decision is a highly encouraging move for the Indian real estate industry, as stable home loan rates foster an environment conducive to rapid growth and development.
""This announcement is expected to significantly benefit real estate hubs like Gurgaon, which are likely to see a surge in demand in the second half of 2024. The RBI's effective regulation of inflation rates sets the stage for substantial growth and development in the latter part of the year,"" Malik said
Mihir Vora, CIO, TRUST Mutual Fund said the tone of the policy was 'mildly hawkish'.
""The Governor in his statement mentioned the potential implications on the emerging markets due to potential growth slowdown in major economies, geopolitical tensions and the unwinding of carry trades causing turmoil in global financial markets,"" he said.
However, Governor Shaktikanta Das reassured that India's macroeconomic fundamentals are robust and that strong buffers have been built to mitigate any such global spillovers, Vora added
Lakshmi Iyer, CEO (Investments & Strategy), Kotak Alternate Asset Managers said the RBI does not seem to be under any duress to act just because of global developments.
""Markets to be guided by Development on the global policy front, domestic inflation, and monsoon progress. Bond yields to continue to find anchor due to FPI buying,"" Iyer said.
Parijat Agrawal, Head – Fixed Income at Union Mutual Fund said RBI's focus remains on bringing headline inflation on a durable basis to a 4 per cent target.
""Although core inflation is in disinflationary trend, volatile food inflation is a cause of worry. Growth remains robust as visible in high-frequency indicators,"" Agrawal added.
Vaidyanathan Srinivasan, Operating Partner, Essar Capital, said the RBI's cautious stance acknowledges the fragile economic environment, emphasising the importance of fostering growth initiatives while keeping inflation in check.

India's CAD eminently manageable this year: RBI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-cad-eminently-manageable-this-year-rbi/articleshow/112366584.cms,08-08-2024,"India's
current account deficit
(CAD)- excess of imports of goods and services over exports, would be manageable according to the Reserve Bank of India. The central bank has expressed optimism on the external sector outlook despite a turmoil in the sub continent and medium term challenges in outlook at the global level.
""We expect CAD to remain eminently manageable during the current financial year"" said
RBI
governor Shaktikanta Das in his monetary policy statement of Thursday. In Q1'2024-25 ( April-June) merchandise trade deficit widened as imports grew faster than exports. Buoyancy in services exports49 and strong remittance receipts are expected to keep CAD within sustainable level in Q1:2024-25.
As for the past trend CAD moderated to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2023-24 from 2.0 per cent of GDP in 2022-23 due to a lower trade deficit and robust services and remittances receipts.
The government's latest economic Survey highlights the positives for services exports. For services, India’s improving integration in global value chains (GVCs) as well as a thriving Global Capability Centre (GCCs) landscape has led to a steady improvement in India’s
services exports
, the Survey said. Besides, schemes like
Atmanirbhar Bharat
and PLI are likely to benefit India’s merchandise exports.
Highlighting the strength of the external sector the governor pointed that India’s external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7 per cent at end-March 2024 from 19.0 per cent at end-March 2023. The net International Investment position to GDP ratio improved from (-) 11.3 per cent to (-) 10.3 per cent during the same period.

"India needs to open economy further, privatise banks: Finance Commission chairman Arvind Panagariya",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-needs-to-open-economy-further-privatise-banks-finance-commission-chairman-arvind-panagariya/articleshow/112355742.cms,08-08-2024,"India needs to open its
economy
further,
privatise banks
and introduce
factor market
reforms to lift its growth beyond 6.5-7% levels, 16th Finance Commission chairman Arvind Panagariya said.
""The main reform we need is the
privatisation
of banks, "" he said, adding that the country had in the last 20-25 years undergone through two cycles of non performance asset and then the government had to step in to clean up. ""And each time we did the cleanup, we got the growth spurt,"" he pointed.
The first cleanup happened under the Vajpayee government, and after that beginning in 2003-04, we began to grow about 8% in real terms, he said, adding that a lot of the macro
reforms
and micro reforms were done, but the banks by then had been in very good shape. ""Private banks were okay even if they got a little bit of these NPA's and they took care of it themselves,"" he said, point out that the government did not have to invest taxpayers' money. ""I think it is a very important part of the reform that's required, "" he said. He also emphasised the need to give more space to the
private sector
in the economy. ""In spite of the expansion of the private sector, the overall economic activity in manufacturing remains heavily in the
public sector
,"" Panagariya said at launch of 'India@100', a book authored by K V Subramanian, Executive Director, International Monetary Fund (IMF) organised by FICCI. ""And the capital is not being efficiently used by the public sector,"" added Panagariya.
Panagariya said that among factor market reforms, which includes land, labour and capital, reform related to land was the most difficult to implement, but
land acquisition
has to be made easier in the country.
The four labour codes also need to be implemented for the
Indian economy
to grow rapidly. He said even if 4-5 states implemented these it will accelerate the growth of the Indian economy.

The figures suggest that the state government will have to mobilise substantial amount, over Rs 2.86 lakh crore, by 2032-33 for servicing of public debt and this could put significant pressure on the state finances, CAG opined.
Considering the off-Budget borrowings (OBB) Rs 1.19 lakh crore and other liabilities for the year 2022-23, which are being serviced out of the
State Budget
, the ratio of
Debt to GSDP
would be 35.64 per cent, which is 10.64 per cent above the set target of 25 per cent as per the TSFRBM Act (Telangana State FRBM), the report said.
This is also 5.94 per cent above the limit (29.70 per cent) prescribed by the XV Finance Commission., it further said.
During 2022-23, the Telangana government resorted to Ways and Means Advances for almost the entire year, except 24 days.
Ways and Means Advances is a temporary facility for the Centre and the state to borrow money from Reserve Bank of India.

Introduced on July 1, 2017, the GST aimed to simplify the previous fragmented tax system. The GST regime has since reduced inefficiencies, simplified compliance, and minimized the cascading impact of taxes. The GST Council, led by the Union Finance Minister and comprising Finance Ministers from all states, plays a key role in managing the tax.
A Finance Ministry study revealed that consumers have saved at least 4% on their monthly household expenses due to GST, with reduced costs for daily essentials like cereals, edible oils, sugar, sweets, and snacks. Key items such as hair oil, toothpaste, soap, detergents, wheat, rice, curd, lassi, wristwatches, TVs up to 32 inches, refrigerators, washing machines, and mobile phones have seen substantial GST rate cuts or zero rates, benefiting consumers nationwide.

was at 6.91 per cent in June, compared to 6.93 per cent in May 2024.
The WALR on outstanding rupee loans of SCBs was placed at 9.91 per cent in June 2024, up from 9.88 per cent in May 2024.
One-Year median marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR) of SCBs remained unchanged at 8.85 per cent in July 2024.
The trend is significant because the Reserve Bank has kept the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for over a year now.
The official stance of the
central bank
is that it wants the transmission of the rate hike to be full. However, some market participants say that the liquidity operations of the central bank have implicitly facilitated lower rates.

RBI
’s annual report on currency and finance which was themed around digitalisation said.
The report citing German data and statistics platform Statista said globally, cybercrime costs are expected to reach $13.82 trillion by 2028, up from $8.15 trillion in 2023. “The average cost of a
data breach
has also risen to $4.45 million in 2023, a 15% increase over three years (IBM, 2023). Recognising the significant costs involved, most central banks have increased their cyber security investment budgets by 5% since 2020. The most common attacks in India are phishing (22%), followed by stolen or compromised credentials (16%),” the report said.
An industry-wise distribution of cyber-attacks in India shows that the automotive industry is the most vulnerable, with smart mobility application programming interfaces (APIs) and electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure emerging as major attack vectors. Government, education and power sectors are the other top sectors most vulnerable to cyber-attacks, the report said. The banking and financial sector and information technology sectors are the least likely to face a cyber-attack the report said.

Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
“Given considerations of financial stability and global coordination, the shift towards open economy digitalisation is expected to be gradual and measured, which has been India’s approach. The internationalisation of the
UPI
is a pertinent example of this approach. The initial steps were aimed to enable Indian travellers and diaspora to make merchant payments using UPI abroad. The next upgradation was the ability to make person-to-person remittances using UPI with the same efficiency as of domestic transactions.” The report said.
Bilateral or multilateral trade and payments arrangements, special vostro accounts, local currency settlements and bilateral swap arrangements are among the ways listed by the central bank to internationalise the rupee.
The report suggested that multilateral arrangements like the ones with the Asian Clearing Union (ACU), SAARC Currency Swap Framework, the UPI-PayNow linkage between India and Singapore and bilateral understandings such as with the Central Bank of the UAE could be a way to internationalise the rupee and support liquidity arrangements especially in times of a financial crunch.
“Authorised dealer banks are permitted to open special rupee Vostro account (SRVA) to settle trade transactions in rupee with any country. Rupee payments for imports can be credited to these accounts. Balance in the SRVA can be used for any permissible current and
capital account
transactions,” the report said.

Venture Capital funds
located in Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) City will not have to disclose the source of their funds after a
budget proposal
is implemented, said officials. The relaxation has been listed in the budget under measures to promote investment and employment, they said.
“This is being done to ease compliance burden on the VC funds headquartered in the
IFSC
(international financial services centre) and bring them on a par with the
Sebi
(Securities and Exchange Board of India)-registered ones,” said a senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.
The budget said, “It is proposed that where a VC fund located in International Financial Services Centre extends a loan/other amount to an assessee, it shall no longer be called upon to explain the source of funds.”
Officials, however, said that the exemption would not provide any immunity under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and that action would be initiated in case a violation is detected.

It also proposed that retail schemes and exchange-traded funds in the IFSC would enjoy
tax exemptions
along similar lines as those available to specified funds. In addition, surcharge would not apply on income tax payable on income from securities by specified funds in the IFSC once the budget proposal gets approved.
“These proposals will exempt a VC fund from scrutiny under section 68 of the Income Tax Act, when regulated by the IFSC Authority,” Gokul Chaudhri, president-tax, Deloitte South Asia, told ET. This is similar to how Sebi-regulated VCs were exempted last year, he said.
According to Chaudhri, section 68 was reworded a few years ago to widen its applicability. “Effectively, a company receiving money from an investor could face scrutiny if the latter did not have documentation to disclose the source of the funds.”
Core Settlement Guarantee Fund
The budget also proposed that certain income of the Core Settlement Guarantee Fund set up in the IFSC be considered exempt. Besides, it said, section 94B would not be applicable to certain finance companies located in the IFSC.
This section addresses concerns over “thin capitalisation”, which leads to reduced taxability on interest income, it said.

RBI selects 5 entities under its regulatory sandbox scheme,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-selects-5-entities-under-its-regulatory-sandbox-scheme/articleshow/112047076.cms,26-07-2024,"The Reserve Bank has selected five
entities
, including Indian Banks'
Digital Infrastructure
Company and Signzy Technologies, to test products they have offered under the

Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, said a growing number of retail investors are now parking their investible surplus in equities, anticipating better returns.
""People are also unsure whether gold prices would rise further (in the short-to-medium term) after a rally in recent years,"" he said.
Similarly, savings of people in rural areas have been hit by retail
inflation
and other factors, Galipelli said.
The government had launched the gold bond and gold monetisation
schemes
in late 2015 to discourage physical purchases of the precious metal and trim imports to reduce its debilitating impact on the
current account deficit
.
The gross mop-up through these two schemes is now budgeted at Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, against Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) last fiscal.
Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, compared with Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore a year before.
The estimates of mop-up through the gold monetisation scheme, however, have been retained at the interim budget level.
The
sovereign gold bond
scheme is targeted at those looking at gold as an investment - helping them buy paper gold instead of physical gold.
The gold monetisation scheme seeks to bring out idle gold with households, temple trusts and others to raise domestic supply.
Both were intended to curb gold imports, which, together with crude oil, have been a big contributor to India's
current account
deficit. Having touched Rs 16,049 crore amid Covid-19 in 2020-21, gold bond issuances moderated before the surge in 2023-24.

"Focus on value creation in CPSEs, not to push disinvestment just to meet targets: DIPAM Secretary",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/focus-on-value-creation-in-cpses-not-to-push-disinvestment-just-to-meet-targets-dipam-secretary/articleshow/112014491.cms,25-07-2024,"New Delhi: The focus of the government will be to improve the performance of CPSEs with a view to maximise wealth creation and not to push disinvestment just to meet targets,
DIPAM
Secretary
Tuhin Kanta Pandey
said on Thursday. He said the market capitalisation of 77 listed public sector entities, which include banks, insurance companies and Central
Public Sector Enterprises
(CPSEs), has jumped 4 times in the last three years to about Rs 73 lakh crore.
In an interview with PTI, Pandey said there has been an improvement in the performance of public sector entities and markets have started valuing these entities in a much better manner. Also,
LIC
has contributed significantly to the total market capitalisation of CPSEs. According to the latest BSE data, LIC's market capitalisation stands at Rs 7.2 lakh crore.
There is a marked performance improvement, capex improvement, management incentives are getting aligned with the performance of CPSEs and markets are noticing it and therefore, there is a change in perception about CPSEs, he said.
""Disinvestment strategy is only supportive. It is subsumed into the asset management strategy, it is not a dominant strategy. If you have a dominant disinvestment strategy then it is a fiscal asset management strategy and not a public asset management strategy. We are seeing a shift towards value creation strategy and focus on creating wealth,"" Pandey said.
The government has also stopped giving any clear target for disinvestment receipts in the Budget document. It now provides the budget for capital receipts, which includes receipts from disinvestment and asset monetisation.
Live Events
In the current fiscal, the government has budgeted Rs 50,000 crore from capital receipts, up from Rs 30,000 crore in the last fiscal.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) will follow a calibrated disinvestment strategy, Pandey said, adding, ""Why should we go on not trusting our stocks? We simply cannot say that this is the target, so come what may, sell the shares. That approach hasn't helped"".

Customs duty structure review to focus on reducing number of rates: Revenue Secretary,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/customs-duty-structure-review-to-focus-on-reducing-number-of-rates-revenue-secretary/articleshow/111993769.cms,24-07-2024,"The government is looking at bringing down the number of
customs duty
levies to five from about a dozen presently, as part of the duty rationalisation exercise,
Revenue Secretary
Sanjay Malhotra said on Wednesday. The reduction in the number of customs rates will help reduce classification disputes, he said when asked about the Budget proposal for a comprehensive review of the
rate structure
in six months.
On Tuesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech said the government will undertake a comprehensive review of the customs rate structure over the next six months to rationalise and simplify it for ease of trade, removal of duty inversion and reduction of disputes.
In an interview to PTI, Malhotra said the rationalisation is intended to reduce the number of
tax rates
levied on import and export of goods.
""Right now, the number of tax rates is more than 10, in double digits... Other than exceptions, we want to reduce this to may be 4 or 5 at the most. The purpose basically is to simplify so that classification disputes do not arise...More the rates, more are the classification disputes. The effort is to merge these rates into fewer number of rates so that classification disputes are reduced,"" Malhotra said.
Talking about the proposal, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC) Chairman Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the exercise would be completed in the next six months so that the proposal could be taken up in the next budget in February 2025.

""Customs duty is levied at various rates. In 6 months time we will definitely look into the various rates and try to bring certain rationalisation in that. In next year's Budget that exercise will be completed and would be presented in next rationalisation. We will look at the number of rates. We will try to keep not too many rates. If there is any inversion that will be corrected,"" Agarwal said.
The FY25 Budget has lowered customs duty on mobile phone, mobile PCBA and mobile charger, 25 critical minerals, gold, ferro nickel and blister copper, oxygen free copper for manufacture of resistors and certain parts for manufacture of connectors.
The customs duty was increased on printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) of specified telecom equipment, ammonium nitrate, and exemption on solar glass and tinned copper interconnect was withdrawn.
Agarwal said the rationalisation was intended to give impetus to domestic manufacturing, strengthening and diversification of the supply chains and giving boost to factors in exports.
In addition, corrective steps have been taken by hiking customs duties in case where items were being imported into the country at unusually cheap rates which were impacting domestic industries.
Likewise, duty inversion on certain items has been corrected.
""The underlying philosophy behind the customs duty rationalisation made in FY25 budget is to boost domestic manufacturing, make the inputs available to domestic industry where there is no availability of such inputs within the country,"" Agarwal said.

On customs duty rationalisation, Saloni Roy, Partner at Deloitte India, said that changes are made to support domestic manufacturing, deepen local value addition and promote export competitiveness.
Changes in basic customs duty (BCD) rate have been announced for various sectors, including medical, mobiles, minerals, solar energy and telecommunications.
""To give further impetus to the phased manufacturing programme and the exponential growth in domestic production and export in the mobile industry, BCD is reduced on mobile phone, mobile PCBA (printed circuit board assembly) and mobile charger from 20 per cent to 15 per cent,"" Roy added.
She said that an increase in BCD rates will discourage the import of concerned items and give direct support to domestic manufacturing.

borrowing
later in the financial year if inflows into national small saving schemes (NSSF) are high, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth told Reuters on Wednesday.
NSSF consists of public investments in schemes like postal deposits, savings certificates, public provident fund and senior citizens' savings scheme, among others.
The Central government has increased its reliance on borrowing from NSSF over the last few years to meet its funding requirements.
In the federal
budget
announcement on Tuesday, the government reduced gross borrowing by Rs 12,000 crore ($1.43 billion) to Rs 14.01 lakh crore for the fiscal year, and cut the fiscal deficit target by 20 basis points to 4.9%.
Market participants were expecting the borrowing to be reduced by around Rs 50,000 crore, after a larger-than-expected surplus transfer from the Reserve Bank of India.

interest-free loans
of ₹1.5 lakh crore in this financial year to bolster their

, FM
Nirmala Sitharaman
announced in her budget speech.
""For promoting competitive federalism and incentivising states for faster implementation of reforms, I propose to earmark a significant part of the 50-year interest-free loan,"" she said. The outlay for states under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure scheme has been raised by ₹20,000 crore from the interim budget level of ₹1.3 lakh crore. Under this scheme, the Centre extends 50-year loans to states at zero interest to boost their durable assets creation. States are required to undertake stipulated reform measures to obtain a part of the capex loans that are conditional in nature. Sitharaman stressed that effective implementation of several of these reforms, especially in land, labour and capital, requires collaboration between the Centre and the states and building consensus, ""as development of the country lies in development of the states"".
The minister also encouraged states that charge high stamp duty to moderate the rates, and also consider further reduction in duties on properties purchased by women. ""This reform will be made an essential component of urban development schemes,"" she said.The FM said that land-related reforms in both rural and urban areas that warrant the active role of states will cover land administration, planning and management, and urban planning, usage and building bylaws.

The government has revised a system introduced in 2020 where annual income of up to 1.5 million rupees is taxed between 5%-20%, while income of over 1.5 million rupees were taxed at 30%.

Currently, Indian taxpayers have the option to select between two tax systems - a legacy plan that allows exemptions on housing rentals and insurance, and a newer one introduced in 2020 that offers slightly lower rates but does not allow major exemptions.
""Increased exemption limits, especially in the way inflation has risen in India is a step in the right direction,"" said Bijal Ajinkya, Khaitan, partner at law firm Khaitan & CO.

Budget Tax Targets: Sitharaman hopes to bump up tax revenues further in FY25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/budget-2024-union-budget-tax-budget-tax-targets-nirmala-sitharaman-hopes-to-bump-up-tax-revenues-further-in-fiscal-2025/articleshow/111956190.cms,23-07-2024,"Key Budget Announcements: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed in the Budget 2024 to increase the collection of gross taxes for this fiscal year. The move to raise tax collection targets reflects hope for a boost in income and consumption in an economy striving to become the world’s third largest.
New Delhi aims to raise gross tax revenue of Rs 38.40 lakh crore, according to Budget document. The Budget now eyes to raise Rs 22.07 lakh crore from direct taxes and Rs 16.33 lakh crore from indirect tax.
In the interim budget, gross tax revenue for fiscal 2025 was estimated at Rs 38.31 lakh crore, up 10.65% from last fiscal year’s Rs 34.65 lakh crore (provisional). The government had aimed to raise Rs 21.99 lakh crore from direct taxes and Rs 16.31 lakh crores from indirect taxes in fiscal 2025 when it presented the interim Budget in February ahead of Lok Sabha polls.
Higher tax kitty for fiscal year 2025 will provide the government a much-needed shot in the arm to stick to the fiscal glide path, crucial for its pitch to rating agencies for a promotion in sovereign rating. The higher tax collection will also help the government channelise funds to capital expenditure, subsidies and welfare schemes.
The government collected ₹19.58 lakh crore as net direct tax in 2023-24, 17.1% more than in the previous fiscal and exceeding the revised estimates by ₹13,000 crore. India had raised Rs 16.64 lakh crore net direct tax in FY23 and Rs 14.08 lakh crore in fiscal 2022.

India's net direct tax collections, comprising corporation tax and personal income tax, rose about 20% on year to Rs 5.74 lakh crore in this fiscal year as of July 11. The personal income tax collections went up by nearly 23 per cent to Rs 3.62 lakh crore till July 11. Personal income tax collection is expected to increase, with more individuals paying taxes with their FY24 returns. The deadline for filing income tax returns is July 31 for the 2024-25 assessment year
While a K-shaped economic recovery in India is seen to be a strong trend, according to several economists, the economy has also beaten almost all countries in terms of rising wealth, according to a Credit Suisse-UBS report. Richer India has also helped in tax collections and is likely to add more to the tax coffers with predictions of higher ultra HNIs and billionaire population.
In FY23 and FY22, indirect tax collections stood at Rs 13.94 lakh crore and Rs 12.94 lakh crore, respectively.
GST collection in this fiscal year is estimated at Rs 21.24 lakh crore, up from Rs 20.14 lakh crore collected in fiscal 2024.

pledged 2 trillion rupees ($23.9 billion) to boost jobs and improve education in India, increased spending to his new allies, while also targeting a smaller fiscal deficit for this year. The government will focus on employment, skilling, small businesses and the middle class in the
fiscal year
through March 2025, Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said in her budget speech Tuesday. She announced a number of employment-linked incentives for businesses to help spur jobs.
The budget is the first under a new
coalition government
led by Modi after his party lost its majority in elections. Joblessness and the high cost of living despite India’s rapid economic growth emerged as key voter concerns.
Bloomberg
The prime minister is seeking to shore up voter support and balance the demands of his coalition partners without blowing out the budget deficit. Curbing the deficit and government debt will be key to raising India’s credit ratings, which are currently at the lowest investment-grade level.
Sitharaman said the government will narrow the deficit to 4.9% of
gross domestic product
in the current financial year, lower than her February projection of 5.1%. She pledged to curb the deficit gradually over time.

“The fiscal consolidation path has served our economy very well and we aim to reach the deficit below 4.5% next year,” she said. “The government is committed to staying the course.”
A revenue windfall this year has boosted the government coffers, giving it ample resources to boost spending while keeping the fiscal deficit under control. The central bank paid the government a record $25 billion dividend, while tax revenues have surged on the back of a stronger economy.
The smaller deficit means the government will cut its borrowing for the year slightly to 14.01 trillion rupees this year. Yields on India’s 10-year bond dropped to its lowest level since April 2022 after the news, before revising their declines. Stocks edged slightly lower, while the rupee traded little changed.
Modi allocated 150 billion rupees in
financial aid
through multilateral agencies to one of his key allies, the Telugu Desam Party, which governs the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. A request for support from a second ally, which runs Bihar state, will be expedited, Sitharaman said.

Capital expenditure in the fiscal year through March 2025 will reach 11.1 trillion rupees, unchanged from February’s forecast

Budget 2024: Govt cuts gross market borrowings to Rs 14.01 lakh crore for 2024-25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/budget-2024-govt-cuts-gross-market-borrowings-to-rs-14-01-lakh-crore-for-2024-25/articleshow/111953807.cms,23-07-2024,"The government lowered its planned gross market borrowing for the financial year ending March 2025 by Rs 12,000 crore on Tuesday.
The government aims to borrow a gross of Rs 14.01 lakh crore, down from Rs 14.13 lakh crore announced at the time of the interim
budget
in February.
In the previous financial year, the federal government borrowed Rs 15.43 lakh crore.
It aims to reduce its fiscal deficit to 4.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from 5.1% as per the interim budget.
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
Government borrowings are one of the key drivers for bond yields, which have fallen since the start of this financial year.
Live Events
India's government finances have also come into sharper focus this year as local currency bonds have been included in JPMorgan's emerging market debt index.
Foreigners bought $8 billion worth of bonds on a net basis in 2024, and the outlook on government finances is being watched keenly by offshore debt investors looking to invest in India.
MARKET REACTION
Government bond yields fell briefly after the borrowing cut.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield declined, hitting its lowest level since April 2022 to 6.9260%.
However, it rose again as the cut in borrowing was lower than what many market participants had anticipated. The yield was at 6.9687% on Tuesday, against 6.9588% before the budget announcement and 6.9633% previous close.

banks
, which was much more than what the lenders had recovered through previous mechanisms of Lok Adalats, DRTs, and the SARFAESI Act, it said.
Since the implementation of IBC in 2016, a total of 31,394 corporate debtors cases ""involving a value of Rs 13.9 lakh crore have been disposed of (including pre-admission case disposals) as of March 2024"", said the Survey tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
.
The loss of control immediately after the beginning of the resolution process has led debtors settle with creditors as soon as the applications are filed with the National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
).
""A singularly notable fact is that Rs 10.2 lakh crore of underlying defaults were addressed at the pre-admission stage. This change in debtor behaviour has been a big boon for banks and other lending institutions,"" it said, adding the government has ""taken several measures to improve the insolvency ecosystem"".
The IBC has created an ""optimal incentive-disincentive mix"" to facilitate above-board and transparent dealings in creditor-debtor relations, it said.

""One in four cases settled after admission was also from this sector. Of the 891 corporate debtors resolved, 133 were real estate companies, forming 15 per cent of the companies resolved,"" it said.
As of March 2024, NCLT has facilitated the closure of 4,131 corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRP).
The Survey said: ""3,171 corporate debtors have been rescued, of which 947 cases have been resolved through approved resolution plans, which brought in a realisable value of Rs 3.36 lakh crore.""
""In the resolved cases, the creditors recovered approximately 32 per cent of their claims,"" it added.
This amounted to a recovery of 85 per cent of the fair value and 162 per cent of the liquidation value of assets.
Now IBC is the dominant recovery route for SCBs (scheduled commercial banks), the Survey said.
Over 3,000 businesses have emerged out of the CIRP, with continued business operations extending the productive use of resources trapped due to financial distress in these corporate debtors.
The firms that went through the resolution process have witnessed a significant improvement in their performance in terms of increase in tangible assets and average capex in the post-resolution period compared to the pre-resolution period.
""The aggregate market valuation of resolved firms rose from around Rs 2 lakh crore in the pre-resolution phase to Rs 6 lakh crore in the post-resolution phase,"" it said.
Also, there is a substantial increase in total employment and around a 50 per cent increase in the average employee expenses in the resolved firms (listed) in the three years post-resolution.
""It is hard to find another policy measure that has created winners,"" the latest Economic Survey said.
As of March this year, 2,476 CIRPs ended in liquidation as they failed to find a buyer within the stipulated time frame.
A total of 586 firms were dissolved at the end of the liquidation process, releasing whatever resources were needed for alternate uses.
The Survey also said that the government has strengthened the NCLTs, regarding infrastructure, increasing its strength by filling vacancies and proposing an integrated IT platform.
Presently, the NCLT has 15 benches spread across the country with the Principal Bench at New Delhi.
""The IBC has established itself as an indispensable component of the asset recovery and reconstruction market. In the process, it has forever changed the credit market landscape in the country for good,"" the Survey said.
The IBC has provided an avenue for corporate debtors to resolve their debt and get an honourable exit from failed business endeavours.
It has promoted ""ease of doing business and encouraging entrepreneurship"", the Survey said, adding, ""The Code has established itself as an effective solution for addressing banks' stress by aiding in significantly reducing GNPAs and helping rescue failing corporate debtors.""

Deposits still most preferred instrument of saving: RBI article,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/deposits-still-most-preferred-instrument-of-saving-rbi-article/articleshow/111843534.cms,18-07-2024,"Mumbai:
Deposits
are still the most preferred instrument of saving in India although market-based instruments are gaining share, said an article published in the Reserve Bank's July Bulletin. The article provides estimates of quarterly financial balance sheet of households and their net financial wealth for 2011-12 to 2022-23.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
The article has been authored by Anupam Prakash, Suraj S, Ishu Thakur and Mousumi Priyadarshini, all officials from the
RBI
's Department of Economic and Policy Research.
""The accumulation of
financial assets
and net financial wealth jumped in 2020-21 due to the pandemic-induced restrictions on mobility and spending along with subdued growth in liabilities; net financial wealth has since exhibited some normalisation as household consumption picked up on the return of normalcy,"" the article stated.
As at end-March 2023, households' financial assets stood at 135.0 per cent of GDP while their financial liabilities were 37.8 per cent of GDP; accordingly, their net financial wealth was placed at 97.2 per cent of GDP, it said..
The spike in financial assets during the Covid-19 pandemic led to an increase of 12.6 percentage points in net financial wealth between end-March 2020 and end-March 2023.

""The listed
equity wealth
of households rose to a peak of 19.4 per cent of GDP as at end-Dec 2021, subsequently moderating to 14.9 per cent of GDP as at end-March 2023. The compilation is restricted to the listed equity holdings in the absence of estimates on unlisted equity investments,"" the article said.
It further said while households have leveraged up, their debt-to-financial assets ratio has remained stable.
It may also be noted that a significant proportion of wealth in India is held in terms of non-financial assets such as housing, which are not covered in this article, the authors said.
The central bank said the views expressed in the article are those of the authors and do not represent the views of the RBI.

Budget: India set to cut fiscal deficit target?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/budget-india-set-to-cut-fiscal-deficit-target/articleshow/111838285.cms,18-07-2024,"Union Budget
: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government will likely reduce its fiscal deficit target slightly, according to people familiar with the matter, signaling an intent to keep a grip on finances as speculation grows about increasing demands from allies.
The gap for the year through March 2025 could be 5% of gross domestic product or even lower, the people said, compared with the 5.1% target set before the national elections. A final decision is expected to be taken in the coming days before Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
gives her budget speech on July 23, they said.
Modi returned to power only with the support of coalition partners, who have been seeking more money for their states. They have already put demands on the table for more than $15 billion in financial aid for the states they run.
While there is pressure to spend more, government finances are boosted by a big dividend transfer from the central bank and healthy tax collections in the world’s fastest-growing major economy, the people said, asking not to be identified before the official budget announcement.
A spokesperson for the Finance Ministry didn’t respond to a request seeking comments.

A windfall gain of $25 billion in dividend from the central bank has created the headroom for extra spending. Net direct tax collections have also grown at about 20% in the fiscal year through July 11.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey also predict the deficit target will be cut to 5%, allowing the government to keep its borrowing unchanged at Rs 14.1 lakh crore ($169 billion) this fiscal year. A lower-than-expected deficit could give an extra fillip to India’s bond market, where benchmark yields are edging toward a two-year low.
India’s fiscal plans are coming under more scrutiny than before after its bonds were included in key global indexes last month. Credit rating companies are considering upgrading India’s debt if the fiscal metrics improve.

Telangana govt to launch farm loan waiver scheme,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/telangana-govt-to-launch-farm-loan-waiver-scheme/articleshow/111827139.cms,18-07-2024,"Telangana government
is all set to launch a farm loan waiver programme, part of its poll promise benefitting 70 lakh farmers, on Thursday, official sources said. Chief Minister A
Revanth Reddy
had earlier announced that the government would implement the loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh by August 15.
The loan waiver funds up to Rs one lakh will be deposited in the farmers' accounts at 4 pm on Thursday.
The chief minister said Rs 7,000 crore in total would be credited to the accounts of farmers whose loans of up to Rs one lakh are being waived. Crop loans of up to Rs 1.5 lakh would be waived by the end of July, and the loan waiver process would be completed in August when loans of up to Rs two lakh are dispensed with.
Reddy also suggested organising a gathering of
farm loan waiver scheme
beneficiaries at ""
Rythu Vedikas
"" and Ministers, MLAs and other public representatives of the respective districts should also attend and share the joy with the farmers.
Ahead of the launching of the flagship programme,
Deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka
will hold a meeting with bankers this morning.
Live Events
A senior level officer will be made available for two districts (undivided old district) in the Secretariat to clarify the doubts, if any, raised by the Collectors on loan waiver scheme and resolve them immediately.
The state government has clarified that ration cards are used only for family identification.
The total number of ration cards in the state is 90 lakh and the number of farmer accounts with bank loans is only 70 lakh.
The chief minister clarified that 6.36 lakh farmers who do not possess ration cards and took farm loans are also eligible to avail the farm loan waiver benefit.

IDBI Bank
ahead of the
Union Budget
2024 and all eyes are now on Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
.
The Narendra Modi government had set the ball rolling for divesting its stake in the development financial institution-turned bank in May 2021. Since then, the Centre has been waiting for the green signal from the
RBI
as the central bank assessed if the bidders met the fit and proper norms. These norms check if the bidders are compliant with regulations and are not under the scanner of other regulators.
The central bank has given its report on all but one bidder which happens to be a foreign participant, which did not share information and the overseas regulator too has not provided data, TOI on Thursday reported. With the current market cap nearing Rs 95,000 crore, the Centre could potentially realize around Rs 29,000 crore from the disinvestment. However, several observers have noted that the transaction terms are not very attractive.
ET Online has not been able to verify this report independently.
Shares of
IDBI Bank
were upbeat, as the scrip traded with gains of nearly 5 per cent as of 11:40 am while the benchmark indices were down 0.3 per cent.

The government and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) collectively own 94.72 per cent of IDBI Bank, with
LIC
holding a 49.24 per cent stake and the government holding 45.48 per cent. Public shareholders account for the remaining 5.28 per cent.
Centre wants to sell 60.7 per cent stake in the bank, comprising 30.5 per cent of its own and LIC's 30.2 per cent.
Market observers view IDBI Bank as a more straightforward
divestment
candidate since it operates as a private lender, with government stake increasing due to substantial capital infusion to manage bad debt-driven losses.
BUDGET 2024: Modi government's divestment agenda in focus
Despite the Modi government's ambitious
privatisation
agenda, targeting public sector companies such as
BPCL
, CONCOR, BEML, Shipping Corporation, IDBI Bank, state-run lenders, and an insurance company, there has been very limited progress. The privatization efforts have been virtually frozen for the last 18 months due to the upcoming general elections.
Recently, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri reiterated that the government has no interest in paring stake in BPCL either. This decision marks a reversal from the 2020 efforts when the government aimed to divest its entire 52.98 percent stake in BPCL. Minister Puri cited BPCL's strong financial performance as a crucial reason for maintaining state ownership.
The Modi government's stance on privatisation is eagerly anticipated, especially as it now depends on coalition partners. The upcoming Union Budget is expected to provide key insights. With the recent rise in PSU stocks, the government is optimistic about meeting its disinvestment target of Rs 50,000 crore for the current financial year.
Despite the government's repeated emphasis on exiting ""non-strategic"" sectors, the only significant success in the last 10 years has been the Air India disinvestment.
Modi likely to shun privatization plans?
Given the recent disappointment in the divestment sphere, the Modi government might depart from his privatisation agenda altogether, news agency Reuters recently reported. Instead, the government would focus on overhauling these state-run firms.
In an interim budget presented before the election, the government did not disclose any figures on stake sales for the first time in over a decade.
The 2021 announcement to privatize most state-run companies included two banks, one insurance company, and firms in the steel, energy, and pharmaceutical sectors, along with plans to close loss-making companies.
However, India has only managed to complete the sale of debt-ridden Air India to the Tata Group, while reversing plans for some others. Additionally, only a 3.5% stake in
LIC
has been sold, along with shares in a few other companies.

Budget: India's food subsidies to cost 11% more than initially planned?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-food-subsidies-to-cost-11-more-than-initially-planned/articleshow/111804928.cms,17-07-2024,"India is likely to spend Rs 2.25 lakh crore ($11.97 billion) on food subsidies this financial year, four government sources said, up around 11% from the interim
budget
estimate in February due to higher spending on the support price for farmers.
The country's combined food and fertiliser bill is expected to reach Rs 3.88 lakh crore, up 5% rise from the estimate in the interim budget unveiled before the election.
Interim budget estimates will be replaced by a new budget from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government that will be presented on July 23.
Food and fertiliser subsidies in the interim budget accounted for about 8% of India's total spending of Rs 47.66 lakh crore during the fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2025.
In the interim budget, the
food subsidy
bill was estimated at Rs 2.05 lakh crore, two of the sources said.

The increase since then is largely due to a rise in the price at which the government buys rice and wheat from domestic farmers, one of the sources said.
Meanwhile, the government is likely to stick to its previous estimate of Rs 1.64 lakh crore for the fertiliser subsidy, two of the sources said.
The ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

"Budget 2024-25: Divestment, dividend targets for FY25 likely to be retained",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/budget-2024-25-divestment-dividend-targets-for-fy25-likely-to-be-retained/articleshow/111615133.cms,10-07-2024,"Budget Expectations
: The government is unlikely to alter, in the full budget, its revenue mop-up target of close to ₹1 lakh crore for FY25 from disinvestment & asset monetisation, and dividends from non-financial central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), senior officials said.
In a rare move, the interim budget in February clubbed the government's disinvestment and asset monetisation targets under the 'miscellaneous capital receipts' head, instead of declaring them separately. The combined realisation for this fiscal was pegged at ₹50,000 crore, against the curtailed FY24 revised estimate of ₹30,000 crore.
Another ₹48,000 crore was to come as dividend from the non-financial CPSEs and entities in which the government holds minority stakes.
While actual dividend collections beat initial estimates for a third straight year through FY24 and analysts expect another good year for CPSEs, the government may not raise this target from the interim budget level, one of the officials told ET.

""The idea is not to present estimates that will fall short of actual realisations and upset resource allocation plans,"" he said. However, a final call, especially on the precise asset monetisation target, will be taken closer to the budget, which will be presented on July 23. The government's disinvestment proceeds totalled ₹16,507 crore and asset monetisation fetched around ₹16,000 crore, beating the combined revised target of ₹30,000 crore for FY24.
Dividend collections from the CPSEs and other entities also rose to a fresh peak of ₹63,749 crore in FY24, according to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (
DIPAM
) data. The FY24 dividend revenue was about 27.5% higher than the revised estimate of ₹50,000 crore, suggesting strong performance by state-run firms across sectors.
As for this fiscal, the government has raked in ₹4,918 crore in such dividends so far. It now expects to conclude the privatisation of
IDBI Bank
and divest stake in
Shipping Corporation of India
and
NMDC Steel
, among others, in FY25. This will help it boost its divestment revenue.
In a report, analysts at CareEdge Ratings said: ""With a bumper dividend from the RBI (₹2.11 lakh crore), the central government's fiscal position remains comfortable, which may limit the urgency to push hard on divestments"". As such, the combined divestment and asset monetisation target accounts for just 1.6% of the government's budgeted non-debt receipts for FY25. It signals the government's diminishing reliance on such revenue to finance its fiscal deficit.

The CareEdge analysts have, however, estimated a huge disinvestment potential of about ₹11.5 lakh crore at current market capitalisation, assuming the government maintains at least a 51% stake in public firms and offloads excess shares.
DIPAM secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had earlier told ET that setting a high annual disinvestment target would potentially create an ""overhang in the market"" and could be detrimental to the value creation strategy of the CPSEs concerned. So, the government would follow a ""calibrated disinvestment strategy"", he said.

accounted for 69 percent of reserves pile-up for the Reserve Bank of India during the April-June quarter benefitting from both volumes in terms of gold purchases and valuation gains due to price rise.
Reserve Bank of India added $5.6 billion to its stock of reserves in the June quarter, the latest Reserve Bank of India data indicated. Of this while foreign currency assets rose $1.9 billion during the quarter, the value of gold in reserves rose $3.8 billion during the quarter. India’s foreign currency reserves are at $652 billion as of June 28.
As per the latest available data with the
RBI
the RBI bought around nine tonnes of gold between end March and end May. The per tonne value went up from $63.44 million per tonne as of end March 2024 to $68 million in end May 2022. At the global level the demand from central banks is triggering a price rally in
gold prices
according to the World Gold Council. This in turn is helping them valuation gains.
“We are building up gold reserves, the data is released from time-to-time” said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das at the post policy media conference on April 5. “All aspects while building up the reserves are assessed and then we make a decision.”
The central bank’s stated objective of holding gold in reserves is mainly to diversify its foreign currency assets base, as a hedge against inflation and foreign currency risks.

The Reserve Bank is one of the top three central banks to accumulate gold in the first quarter of the calendar year according to the World Gold Council data with only Turkey and China’s central bank buying more gold than India.
Central banks globally have actively started accumulating gold more aggressively after the Russia- Ukraine war started in February of 2022. The RBI too has followed the trend of central banks globally. Besides, it is slowly moving physical gold bought overseas back home likely as a measure of precaution after the escalation of geopolitical tensions in the northern hemisphere
In what was an interesting quarter for the gold market, central banks made clear their commitment to the longstanding trend of gold buying. While the recent price rally may have impacted trade execution, for those central banks that manage their gold reserves more actively, we do not expect it will derail any strategic gold accumulation plans they may have, the World Gold Council said in iits recent report.
The Resrrve Bank has been actively accumulating gold as part of its resreves management strategy since December 2017. But it has become more aggressive post COVID.

India's high public debt offers limited space for welfare spending: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-high-public-debt-offers-limited-space-for-welfare-spending-report/articleshow/111577268.cms,08-07-2024,"India's high
public debt
offers limited fiscal space to undertake welfare measures which can help stimulate the economy, a foreign brokerage said on Monday. In a report that comes weeks ahead of the presentation of the budget,
Goldman Sachs
said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may continue on the fiscal consolidation roadmap, sticking to the 5.1 per cent
fiscal deficit
target announced in the interim budget.
It said investors are expecting from the budget some relaxation in fiscal consolidation path and a shift in focus to
welfare spending
from capital expenditure.
However, the same is not plausible, the brokerage hinted.
""There is limited fiscal space in our view to stimulate the economy given high public debt, (and) India's infrastructure upgrades have created long-term positive growth spillovers which policymakers may not be willing to give up,"" it reasoned.
It said that the final fiscal deficit target may also be lowered from the present 5.1 per cent, and Sitharaman may further reduce the number to 4.5 per cent in FY26.

Even if there is ""some expenditure allocation"" towards welfare spending, it may not require a reduction in capex given the Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend transfer from the Reserve Bank, it said.
There is a limited fiscal space for stimulus in FY25, it said, pointing out that interest expense constitutes a large share at 5.4 per cent of GDP in the general government's budget.
""Our fiscal impulse calculations also show that general government fiscal policy has been a drag on growth since FY22 and will remain so in FY25 and FY26 given the fiscal consolidation target of the central government,"" it said.
Capex grew at a healthy 31 per cent between FY21-24, giving a boost to growth, it said.
The brokerage said the upcoming budget may go beyond just fiscal numbers, and lay emphasis on job creation.
For this it may focus on labour-intensive manufacturing, credit for small businesses, continued focus on services exports by expanding global capability centres. It may also have a thrust on domestic food supply chain and inventory management to control price volatility, the report said.
It may also lay out a path for the future of public finance in India, which will entail a roadmap for public debt sustainability, and green finance.

Budget 2024: Drugmakers want Nirmala Sitharaman to prescribe tax relief tablet for the economy
Moreover, a Reuters report has stated that Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's JD(U) another key ally to the Modi-led NDA government has demanded additional grant for his state.
JD(U) and TDP's hefty demands
With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) faiing to win a clear majority in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, it is, to a large extent, relying on Naidu’s TDP and the Janata Dal (United), to sit in power.
These regional parties, in turn, have come with their own set of demands from the BJP-led government. As per a Reuters report, these two states, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, are now demanding Rs 48,000 crore in additional funds for the financial year ending March 2025. This is according to a document as reviewed by Reuters, which listed demands from one of the state governments, and its source.
Further, both states have asked the centre to nearly double unconditional long-term loans offered by the government to all states for infrastructure spending to Rs 1 lakh crore, according to Reuters report.
Meanwhile, TDP has reiterated old demands that Andhra Pradesh has been consistently raising and Naidu broached again include Outer Ring Road project for Amravati (which has been under consideration since 2018), 6/8-laning of Hyderabad to Vishakhapatnam national highway (which has been under consideration since 2019), support of state for development of Dugarajapatnam port (proposal accept by ministry of shipping and ports in 2012), Andhra Pradesh IPS cadre review (pending since 2015), release of Rs 385 crore for Greyhounds training centre (a part installment had been released in 2018).
With the BJP promising to restore Andhra Pradesh's development progress during campaigning for the polls, it is only imperative that the demands will have to be met.
How grants to states may make Modi pay in Budget 2024
In the interim Budget 2024, Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the continuation of the scheme of fifty-year interest free loan for capital expenditure to states with total outlay of Rs1.3 lakh crore.
Further, a provision of Rs 75,000 crore as fifty-year interest free loan was proposed this year to support the State Governments for the milestone-linked reforms of Viksit Bharat.
In the recent meeting between Naidu and BJP leaders, the proposed financial package for Andhra Pradesh includes raising the fiscal deficit ceiling of 3 per cent of state gross domestic product by allowing an additional 0.5% of borrowing for the financial year through March 2025. That’s equivalent to about Rs 7000 crore, Bloomberg reported.
Alongside, demands also include Rs 50,000 crore to build the new capital of Amaravati, of which Rs 15,000 crore to be allocated in the current fiscal year; Rs 12,000 crore this fiscal year for the Polavaram irrigation project, and a commitment for more funds going forward; Rs 15,000 crore over the next five years to clear overdue debt; Rs 10,000 crore for infrastructure development under the federal government’s 50-year loan scheme.
The states also want more headroom to borrow funds from the market, a limit set by the federal government, according to Reuters report.
The ask for additional payout may mean a lot of changes to existing allocated funds and that announced in the interim budget.
However,
sources told ET that Sitharaman assured Naidu that she would consider Andhra Pradesh's demands
within the constraints of the national budget.
Will the incessant demands be a hurdle on way to meet fiscal target?
In order to maintain it's 5.1 per cent fiscal deficit target, the government may have to do a 'tight rope walking' to align with multiple state demands, as per economists.
""Given the pressure on State finances and the competing claims by multiple State Governments, the Union Government will do a tight-rope walking by incentivising States to promote internal resource generation,"" said Dr. Manoranjan Sharma, the Chief Economist at Infomerics Ratings.

Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda said that there could be some minor tweaking for some of the line items.
""As mentioned earlier it is the same government with the same schemes which are already part of the interim budget. There could be some minor tweaking for some of the line items which can be subsumed in the large sized budget,"" he said.
Sabnavis added: ""As far as states are concerned all transfers are mandated by the Finance Commission and hence there is no deviation here. For the long term loans given for infra, it is based on the states also bringing in some reforms as well as contributing partly for the projects which are largely financed by the interest free loan given by the centre.""

Modi’s top coalition ally Chandrababu Naidu seeks more than Rs 1 lakh crore handout,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/modis-top-coalition-ally-chandrababu-naidu-seeks-more-than-12-billion-handout/articleshow/111513960.cms,05-07-2024,"A key ally in Prime Minister Narendra
Modi
’s coalition government is demanding financial support of more than Rs 1 lakh crore ($12 billion) for the state he runs in southern India, according to people familiar with the matter, adding pressure on the federal budget.
N Chandrababu Naidu
, head of the
Telugu Desam Party
and also chief minister of
Andhra Pradesh
state, met Modi Thursday to request an aid package to build the capital city in the state and fund other projects. Naidu has requested a substantial portion of the support to be paid from this year’s national budget, the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party failed to win an outright majority for the first time in a decade in recently held national elections, and is reliant on Naidu’s TDP and another coalition party — Janata Dal (United) — to run the government. Local media reported that JDU, which is led by Nitish Kumar, is also seeking a special financial aid package for the eastern state of Bihar, which he governs. Modi’s government is expected to announce its national budget later in July.
Modi has agreed in principle to providing the financial support to Naidu, the people said. The TDP leader met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday to discuss the details. The government hasn’t yet agreed on the exact amount of the support, the people said.
The financial package of more than 1 trillion rupees sought by Andhra Pradesh includes the following, some of the people said:

Raising the
fiscal deficit
ceiling of 3% of state gross domestic product by allowing an additional 0.5% of borrowing for the financial year through March 2025. That’s equivalent to about Rs 7000 crore
Rs 50,000 crore to build the new capital of Amaravati, of which Rs 15,000 crore to be allocated in the current fiscal year
Rs 12,000 crore this fiscal year for the Polavaram irrigation project, and a commitment for more funds going forward
Rs 15,000 crore over the next five years to clear overdue debt
Rs 10,000 crore for infrastructure development under the
federal government
’s 50-year loan scheme
The funding demands will add pressure on the national budget, which Modi’s government has been trying to curb in order to bring down debt. Sitharaman, who was reappointed to her post last month, had pledged to narrow the budget deficit to 5.1% of GDP in the fiscal year through March 2025. Credit rating companies like S&P Global Ratings are closely watching the fiscal outlook to determine whether to upgrade India’s debt.
Naidu has been pushing to create a new capital in Andhra Pradesh after the state was split from Telangana in 2014, with the then-state capital of Hyderabad going to Telangana. The project to create Amaravati as the capital stalled after Naidu lost the 2019 state elections.
Andhra Pradesh’s government is facing severe financial strain, according to the TDP, with expenses like salaries, pensions and debt servicing exceeding the state’s revenue. The state’s public debt was 33% of its GDP at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 31% four years ago, official data show.
“There is no other way to face such challenges except by way of financial hand-holding by the central government,” the TDP said in a statement Thursday.

Key among Naidu's demands were funds for the Polavaram irrigation project, special assistance for backward regions, and support for the development of the new capital, Amaravati.
The chief minister also sought resolution of pending issues stemming from the bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh.
The meeting assumes significance as it comes just weeks before the presentation of the Union Budget 2024-25.
The sources indicated that Sitharaman gave a patient hearing to Naidu's concerns and gave an assurance that she will look into Andhra Pradesh's demands within the broader fiscal constraints.
Naidu has been vocal about the state's financial distress and sought increased central support to tide over the fiscal challenges, when he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several Union Ministers on Thursday.
The Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party is a crucial partner of the NDA with its 16 Lok Sabha MPs supporting the Narendra Modi-led government.

Centre sacrificed large amount of GST revenue to compensate states: Former CEA Subramanian,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-sacrificed-large-amount-of-gst-revenue-to-compensate-states-former-cea-subramanian/articleshow/111493775.cms,04-07-2024,"The Centre has sacrificed a large portion of revenue from Goods and Services Tax (GST), up to 1 per cent of GDP, every year since the rollout of the new
indirect tax regime
to fund a 14 per cent compensation guarantee provided to states, former Chief Economic Advisor
Arvind Subramanian
said on Thursday. Subramanian, who was actively involved in the implementation of the
GST
regime, also said that it would not be advisable at this point in time to bring
petrol and alcohol
under the GST.
GST was rolled out on July 1, 2017, subsumed 17 taxes and 13 cesses into a 5-tier structure, thereby, simplifying the tax regime.
Addressing an event organised by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress(CSEP), Subramanian further said that the GST is a remarkable reflection of cooperative federalism and a counterexample to the narrative of fiscal centralisation by the Centre in the last decade.
Subramanian, currently a senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that the GST has worked broadly on expected lines to benefit the poorer states.

""The centre has lost 0.5-1 per cent of GDP in revenue every year in the last seven years,"" he said, adding that bringing the cess into a rationalised rate structure can ensure that compensation may not be necessary in future.
The eminent economist pointed out that GST revenues have come back to the pre-GST level, despite rate cuts showing that collections have improved and indirect
taxation
has become a bit more progressive.
Subramanian further said that reforms in the GST structure are deeply necessary but highly unlikely to happen.
""What you could have done at the founding moment...GST rates could have been simplified at the founding moment,"" he observed.
On bringing alcohol and petroleum under the GST regime, Subramanian said, ""I do not think it is politically advisable now to press states to give up more
fiscal sovereignty
"".
The GST compensation cess was discontinued after fiscal 2021-22.
The gross GST collection increased 8 per cent to Rs 1.74 lakh crore in June.
GST contributes significantly to state revenues - states receive 100 per cent of SGST collected in that state, approximately 50 per cent of IGST (i.e. on inter-state trade). A significant portion of CGST -- 42 per cent -- is devolved to the states based on the Finance Commission's recommendations.

""After the demerger of land assets of the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), its possible divestment looks likely in FY25, provided favourable market conditions prevail. If the government offloads its entire stake in SCI, it could generate Rs 12,500-22,500 crore as divestment proceeds,"" according to the report.
The other plausible candidates include
CONCOR
and Pawan Hans, the rating agency said, adding that they continue to be on the slow burner.
In the last ten years, the government has raised Rs 5.2 lakh crore from the divestment initiatives.
According to the report, the government can raise Rs 11.5 lakh crore by selling stakes in state-owned companies without getting the stake below 51 per cent.
Selling stakes in central public sector enterprises can contribute Rs 5 lakh crore, while the remaining Rs 6.5 lakh crore can come from stake sales in insurance firms and banks, it said.
The government may not opt to divest all its potential, and the decision to divest these listed firms may be influenced by the industry's strategic nature, the companies' profitability, financial market conditions and welfare/social considerations, the agency added.

Giving example, the ministry said that the rate of food items like unpacked wheat, rice, curd, and lassi, which were taxed at 2.5%-4% before GST implementation, is nil after the GST rollout. The ministry said there was saving on expenditure on many items of mass consumption after GST implementation like cosmetics, wrist watches, furniture and mattresses, which are taxed at lower rate than pre-GST era.
Even items like mobile phones, TVs refrigerators, washing machines and electrical appliances, which attracted 31.3% taxes in the pre-GST era, are now in the 18% GST slab in GST regime.
The finance ministry added that GST has also reduced the compliance burden for the small taxpayers, by waiving off annual return filing requirement for taxpayers with aggregate annual turnover of up to ₹2 crore in fiscal 2023-24.
Experts say that going forward, rationalizing
GST rates
, removal of ITC restrictions, and implementing specific sectoral reforms, will set a new era of GST reform. ""As we celebrate the 7th anniversary of GST today, the enhanced positive sentiment of industry and the continued buoyancy in GST collections sets the decks for pursuing forward-thinking reforms under GST 2.0,"" said Mahesh Jaising, partner, direct tax, Deloitte India.

"Finance ministry lauds GST, says it reduced tax rates on household goods, brought relief to every home",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/finance-ministry-lauds-gst-says-it-reduced-tax-rates-on-household-goods-brought-relief-to-every-home/articleshow/111403209.cms,01-07-2024,"Finance Ministry on Monday lauded the Goods and Services Tax (
GST
), which marked seven years of implementation, and said that it has brought significant
relief
to households by reducing taxes on essential items like household appliances and mobile phones.
Launched on July 1, 2017, GST replaced around 17 local taxes and cesses. The theme for this year's GST Day is ""Sashakt Vyapar Samagra Vikas"" (Empowered Trade Overall Growth).
The finance ministry highlighted that the reduction in
tax rates
on
household goods
post-GST has brought happiness and relief to homes. ""With
reduced
tax rates on household goods after GST implementation, #7yearsofGST has brought happiness and relief to every home through lower GST on household appliances and mobile phones,"" the ministry stated in a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).
Since its rollout, the GST taxpayer base has expanded significantly, reaching 1.46 crore in April 2024 from 1.05 crore in April 2018. ""We have witnessed a quantum jump in the taxpayer base along with improved compliance,"" PTI quoted Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) Chairman Sanjay Kumar Agarwal as saying.
Comparative charts released by the ministry show that GST has made living easier by lowering the expenditure on food items and mass consumption goods. Food items such as unpacked wheat, rice, curd, and lassi, which previously faced taxes of 2.5-4 percent, are now tax-free under GST.

Additionally, household goods including cosmetics, wrist watches, sanitary plastic ware, doors and windows, furniture, and mattresses are now taxed at 18 percent, down from the 28 percent rate under the old excise and VAT regime. Essential electronics like mobile phones, TVs up to 32 inches, refrigerators, washing machines, geysers, and fans, which were previously taxed at 31.3 percent, now fall under the 18 percent tax slab.
The ministry also emphasized the reduced compliance burden for small taxpayers. The
GST Council
has recommended waiving the annual return filing requirement for taxpayers with an aggregate annual turnover of up to Rs 2 crore in fiscal 2023-24. The Quarterly Return Filing and Monthly
Payment
of Taxes (QRMP) scheme has cut the number of returns filed annually from 24 to 8 for over 44 lakh small taxpayers. Additionally, the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF) has ensured seamless passage of Input Tax Credit (ITC).
GST's implementation has not only simplified the tax structure but also fostered growth and compliance, bringing tangible benefits to households and businesses alike.

Fiscal deficit in April-May at 3% of annual target,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/fiscal-deficit-in-april-may-at-3-of-annual-target/articleshow/111349274.cms,29-06-2024,"New Delhi: The central government's
fiscal deficit
in the first two months of FY25 narrowed to 3% of the annual target, compared with 11.8% a year before, as revenue mop-up rose on the back of a generous
central bank dividend
in May while expenditure eased, substantially erasing the April gap.
The deficit was to the tune of 12.5% of the full-year target in April, against 7.5% a year before.
The improved performance in May keeps the government firmly on course to realise its target of containing the fiscal gap at 5.1% of GDP in FY25, analysts said. It aims to reduce the gap further to 4.5% of GDP in FY26. The official data released on Friday showed, in absolute terms, the fiscal deficit between April and May stood at just ₹50,615 crore, compared with ₹2,10,287 crore a year before. In May alone, the government witnessed a rare fiscal surplus of ₹1.6 lakh crore, driven by a record ₹2.11 lakh crore central bank dividend and a compression in both capital and revenue spending amid the general election, the data showed.
In the first two months of this fiscal, revenue expenditure grew 4.7% from a year earlier, while capital spending dropped 14.4%. The moderation is sharper in May alone-capex crashed by a half while revenue spending dropped 33% from the year before. Consequently, total expenditure between April and May eased 0.4% from a year earlier to ₹6.23 lakh crore.
Live Events
""The revenue upside seen from non-tax--and to a smaller extent--tax receipts suggests headroom to both boost expenditure and target a faster fiscal consolidation than what was pencilled into the Interim Budget for FY2025,"" said
Aditi Nayar
, chief economist at
ICRA
.
Total receipts hit ₹5.73 lakh crore until May, up 37.8% from a year before and way above the targeted full-year increase of 10.8%, thanks to better-than-expected tax and non-tax revenue.
Net tax receipts until May rose 14.7% from a year before to ₹3.19 lakh crore, while non-tax revenue mop-up surged 87% to ₹2.52 lakh crore.

balance sheets
, low levels of impairments and strong capital buffers, but the Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) remains watchful of the emerging risks, including those from cyber hazards,
climate change
and global spillovers, governor Shaktikanta Das said in his foreword in the bi-annual financial stability report (FSR).
The highest priority must be assigned to governance – strong governance is at the core of resilience of stakeholders in the financial system, Das said. “Our approach of balancing growth and stability, with willingness to take proactive and prudent actions to prevent accumulation of risks, is promoting long-term resilience and stability of the financial system. It is vital that we consolidate these gains and nurture a financial system that is future-ready and supports the needs of India’s growing economy,” Das said.
Results of the bi-annual stress test conducted by the RBI showed that even in a severely stressed macroeconomic environment, the aggregate CET1 (common equity Tier 1) for banks would reduce by 300 basis points only, from the 13.8% at the end of March 2024, much higher than the minimum regulatory CET1 ratio of 5.5%.
Moreover, the gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio of all commercial is likely to improve to 2.5% by March 2025 from 2.8% at the end of March 2024 under the baseline scenario worsening to 3.4% if the macroeconomic environment worsens to a severe stress scenario.
Under the severe stress scenario, the GNPA ratios of public sector banks may increase to 4.1% in March 2025 from 3.7% in March 2024 and to 2.8% in March 2025 for private sector banks from 1.8% in March 2025. For foreign banks it will increase to 1.3% in March 2025 from 1.2% in March 2024.

Das said that though the matrix of financial stability is perhaps at its best currently, but the real challenge is to maintain it and improve upon it further. “The regulators, on their part, remain committed to these goals. We are focused on having in place an ecosystem that is adaptive and proactive in safeguarding the stability of the financial system,” Das said.
All
financial sector
regulators, remain committed to promote innovation, financial inclusion, efficient payment and settlement systems, and a robust financial system. But though new technologies offer gains in efficiency and customer experience, but they can also bring with them sudden and widespread disruptions to the financial system, he said.
He urged all financial sector stakeholders to invest adequately to take full advantage of technological advancements, but also take steps to safeguard the security and soundness of their systems.

security
establishment is advocating a cautious approach to any unhindered and blanket approval to the
FDI
proposals from China given the history of corporate behaviour of
Chinese
companies in the country.
ET has learnt that it has been suggested that before lifting the
restrictions
for Chinese FDI that were put in place during Covid, a system of
risk assessment
must be put in place.
There must be
review
and monitoring, including through robust IT tools and databases, when it comes to FDI from countries of concern, highly placed sources told ET. Once a system is in place, disposal of cases should take place through a time-bound mechanism, sources pointed out.
National
security should not be overlooked while advocating unhindered FDI from countries of concern, sources explained. Desirable investments that can contribute to access of new technologies and
domestic value addition
should be encouraged and approved; sources suggested.
The 2020 restrictions on Chinese FDI and subsequent probe by agencies is not holding back Chinese investments in certain sectors. Sources also pointed out that pre-entry mechanisms are not the only part of improving the
investment
climate in the country.

Online gaming companies get summons for cashback to players since October,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/online-gaming-companies-get-summons-for-cashback-to-players-since-october/articleshow/111294551.cms,26-06-2024,"The Directorate General of
GST
Intelligence (
DGGI
) has sent fresh
summons
to
online gaming companies
, including
Delta Corp
, seeking details of the
cashback
given to the
players
from October onwards.
The agency detected reimbursements of taxed money back to players as cashback in a separate promo account by online gaming companies post implementation of the 28% GST (goods and services
tax
) on the full entry level betting amount.
The
DGGI Gurgaon
has sent summons for a period between October 2023 and June 15, 2024, ET has learnt.
""Investigation detected that the real money gaming companies were offering cashback to the players in their promo account for which summons had been sent,"" a person aware of the notices sent told ET, clarifying that these were fresh summons and not related to past tax issues.
""There are multiple companies which are being probed,"" the person said, declining to divulge details.
Live Events
Typically, a player has three accounts - a deposit wallet, a payment wallet and a promo wallet. These companies were transferring cashback in the promotional wallet to players.
Email and text queries sent to
Delta Corp
, which owns poker site Adda52.com, remained unanswered till the time of filing of the story.
In August, the GST Council had clarified that 28% GST was applicable on online gaming and that the tax is to be levied on entry-level bets on online gaming platforms and not on what players pay in each game from the winning amount. The effective date for the amendments was October 1, 2023.
Legal experts said cashback should not be subject to GST.
""When the taxes are already paid on the entire consideration paid by the user, the credit from the online companies should not be subject to further GST,"" said Abhishek Rastogi, founder of legal services firm
Rastogi Chambers
.
The GST Council was expected to review the tax on online gaming after six months, but in its last meeting the review could be taken up.
Gaming companies are already staring at tax demands of about ₹1.14 lakh crore with appeals against it pending in various courts.

external debt
was contained to $663 billion as of March 2024, up 6 percent over March 2023. The external debt to
GDP ratio
too declines to 18.7 percent from 19 percent, But the
debt service
ratio increased to 6.7 per cent of current receipts at end-March 2024 from 5.3 per cent at end-March 2023, reflecting higher debt service cost.

The valuation impact helped contain India's external debt by one percentage point.
Valuation effect
due to the appreciation of the dollar vis-à-vis the rupee and other major currencies such as yen, the euro and SDR amounted to $ 8.7 billion. Excluding the valuation effect, external debt would have increased by $ 48.4 billion instead of $ 39.7 billion at end-March 2024 over end-March 2023, the central bank release said.
Notably, the share of vulnerable short terms debt has also declined. The share of short-term debt with original maturity of up to one year declined to 18.5 per cent at end-March 2024 from 20.6 per cent at end-March 2023.

Centre may prepay market loans taken to compensate states for GST revenue loss during Covid years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-may-prepay-market-loans-taken-to-compensate-states-for-gst-revenue-loss-during-covid-years/articleshow/111204000.cms,23-06-2024,"New Delhi: The central government may be able to repay Rs 2.69 lakh crore loans it had taken to compensate states for
GST revenue
loss in FY21 and FY22 by November 2025, four months ahead of its scheduled repayment, an official has said. The full repayment of the market borrowings is expected earlier than the previously calculated timeline of March 2026.
The issue is expected to be taken up for discussion in the next meeting of the
GST
Council in August, the official added.
The compensation cess was initially brought in for five years to make up the revenue shortfall of states, following the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The compensation cess expired in June 2022, but the amount collected through the levy is being used to repay the interest and principal of the Rs 2.69 lakh crore that the Centre had borrowed during COVID-19.
At the 53rd GST Council meeting on Saturday, it was learnt that Karnataka had raised the issue of continuation of compensation cess levy, repayment of the loan amount and its way forward.
""It was clarified to the states that the loan amount may be repaid early. Maybe, by November 2025 instead of March 2026. So, how the cess amount would be apportioned beyond November 2025, all this would be discussed in the next Council meeting,"" the official said.
Live Events
The GST Council will now have to take a call on the future of the current GST compensation cess with regard to its name and the modalities for its distribution among the states once the loans are repaid.
To meet the resource gap of the states due to the short release of compensation, the Centre borrowed and released Rs 1.1 lakh crore in 2020-21 and Rs 1.59 lakh crore in 2021-22 as back-to-back loans to meet a part of the shortfall in cess collection.
In June 2022, the Centre extended the levy of compensation cess, which is imposed on luxury, sin and demerit goods, till March 2026 to repay borrowings taken in FY21 and FY22 to compensate states for revenue loss.
GST was introduced on July 1, 2017, and states were assured of compensation for the revenue loss till June 2022, arising on account of the GST rollout.
Though states' protected revenues were growing at 14 per cent compounded growth post-GST, the cess collection did not increase in the same proportion. COVID-19 further increased the gap between the protected revenue and the actual revenue receipt, including a reduction in cess collection.
To meet the resource gap of the states due to the short release of compensation, the Centre borrowed and released Rs 2.69 lakh crore in 2020-21 and 2021-22 as back-to-back loans to meet a part of the shortfall in cess collection. This loan was to be repaid by March 2026.

While speaking at the

organised by the College of Supervisors, the
RBI chief
said ""Our timely action resulted in slowing down growth of unsecured loans. If left unattended, vulnerabilities on unsecured loans could have become a bigger problem.""
Unsecured loans, which are loans not backed by collateral, have seen a surge in demand. This increase has raised concerns within the RBI about the potential for higher default rates and the overall impact on the financial system.
He also noted that the RBI has been closely monitoring the situation and urged financial institutions to exercise caution in their lending practices.
Governor Das also underscored the importance of maintaining robust
credit assessment
processes and
risk management
frameworks. He called on banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to strengthen their oversight mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with unsecured lending.

'Indian financial system in a stronger position'
The RBI governor lauded India's financial system and said that it is in a much better position than what it was before the Covid pandemic.
In his address, he said, ""India’s domestic financial system is now in a much stronger position, characterised by robust capital adequacy, low levels of nonperforming assets, and healthy profitability of banks and NBFCs.""
""There is, however, no room for complacency. We must keep constant vigil and continue to take proactive measures to sustain this progress,"" he further added.

Incremental currency in circulation since the
election
commission announced the election date in March till the last phase of election at Rs 89,080 crore as of June 7 was 22 percent higher than Rs 72,680 crore in the same period of 2019 elections. This could be probably due to the impact of COVID related disruptions and the surge in inflation over the five year period.
Currency in circulation amounted to Rs 35.87 lakh crore as of June 07, 2024, reflecting the data of the period when the last phase of election ended, according to the latest data released by the Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday compared to Rs 34.98 lakh crore as of March 15, a day before election date was announced.
The surge in currency in circulation is significant despite the withdrawal of Rs 2000 note earlier in May 2023 . The growth in currency in circulation, the major constituent of reserve money with a share of 75.1 per cent – decelerated to 4.1 per cent during 2023-24 from 7.8 per cent a year ago, due to the withdrawal of Rs 2000 banknotes,
RBi
’s latest Annual Report said.
Reserve Bank studies in the past have shown a strong link between
election spending
and sure in currency in circulation. But this link is weakening due to the surge in
digital
transactions. “ This could largely reflect the higher cost of managing election funding as inflation has risen faster compared to earlier few elections” said an economist with a private bank, requesting anonymity.

A substantial part of the precious commodity is stored abroad, the sources said, adding that India also had its holding with the
Bank of England
like other countries.
The movement of 100 metric tonnes into India has taken the overall quantity stored locally to over 408 metric tonnes of gold, which means the local and foreign holding is now split almost evenly.

Members of the panel would include representatives of NPCI, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.
From the payments industry, Vipin Surelia, head of risk at Visa, Arif Khan, chief innovation officer at Razorpay, Jitendra Gupta, founder of Jupiter, and Pranay Jhaveri, managing director of Euronet, have been appointed as members of this committee, sources told ET Bureau.
The platform will define the operational parameters and processes that will determine the extent to which data will be provided by reporting entities like banks and fintechs. The committee will have to specify these parameters.
Surging digital frauds
An analysis of frauds reported across banks has revealed a significant increase in the number of cases in FY24, with a total of 36,075 cases, marking a nearly 300 per cent rise from the 9,046 cases reported in FY22.
Despite this surge, the amount involved in these frauds has drastically decreased from Rs 45,358 crore to Rs 13,930 crore, according to the central bank's annual report for FY24.
The report highlighted a 46.7 per cent drop in the total value of frauds reported during FY24 compared to the previous year. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) noted that while
private sector banks
reported the highest number of fraud cases over the past three years,
public sector banks
accounted for the majority of the fraud amounts.
Frauds in digital payments, including card and internet transactions, were the most common in terms of the number of cases, the RBI stated. However, when considering the value, the majority of frauds were linked to loan portfolios. The analysis indicated, ""While small value card/internet frauds contributed maximum to the number of frauds reported by the private sector banks, the frauds in public sector banks were mainly in loan portfolio.""
The number of frauds related to card and internet payments surged from 3,596 in FY22 to 29,082 in FY24. The value of these frauds also increased significantly from Rs 155 crore in FY22 to Rs 1,457 crore in FY24.
Additionally, a study of fraud cases reported during FY23 and FY24 showed a 'significant' time lag between the occurrence and detection of frauds.
The RBI reported that 94 per cent of the fraud amounts reported in FY23 occurred in previous financial years. Similarly, 89 per cent of the fraud amounts reported in FY24 were from earlier fiscal periods.

The clean economy pillar focuses on

, how to mitigate
greenhouse gas emissions
in various industries,
carbon capture
utilisation and storage, and collaborative financing mechanisms to facilitate trading and reduce barriers for low-carbon projects.
Member countries are expected to decarbonise and reduce the climate impact of the transportation sector, follow advanced sustainable agricultural practices, address drivers of deforestation and degradation, including by working with companies that source products from the Indo-Pacific region, and create enabling conditions necessary to facilitate these activities.
Trade experts cautioned that India should not allow the import of genetically modified seeds and foods in the pretence of food security as it may lead to a surge in subsidised agriculture commodity imports.
""Large seed monopolies want farmers to buy seeds from them every time if once bought,"" said a Delhi-based trade expert on condition of anonymity. So, the country should ""not agree to restrict farmers' rights to reproduce or exchange seeds or surrender the right to limit trade or provide subsidies to farmers for fertilisers, electricity, and irrigation"", the person added.

India set for first current account surplus in 10 quarters by Q4FY24: Ind-Ra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-set-for-first-current-account-surplus-in-10-quarters-by-4qfy24-ind-ra/articleshow/110732121.cms,05-06-2024,"India Ratings and Research
(
Ind-Ra
) projects that India's current account balance (CAB) will achieve a surplus of approximately USD 6 billion (0.6 per cent of GDP) in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2024 (Q4FY24).
This marks the first surplus since the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 (1QFY22), a significant turnaround from the previous quarter's deficit of USD 10.5 billion (1.2 per cent of GDP).
Despite this positive quarter, the overall CAB for FY24 is expected to remain in deficit at 0.6 per cent of GDP, the lowest since FY17, excluding the pandemic-affected FY21.
The
global economic environment
, though still uncertain, is showing signs of improvement for 2024. Easing inflationary pressures and robust economic growth in the US and several emerging markets contribute to a brighter outlook.
The global manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has been expanding for three consecutive months, reaching 50.3 in April 2024, with consistent growth in the US and emerging economies, except for the European region.
Live Events
Ind-Ra forecasts a sharp increase in
merchandise exports
to about USD 112 billion in 1QFY25, an 8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise, the fastest in seven quarters, partly due to a favorable base effect.
Merchandise imports
are expected to reach USD 169 billion in the same period, up 6 per cent YoY, resulting in a
goods trade deficit
of USD 57 billion.
Services exports, although resilient, are anticipated to see slower growth due to a high base effect and weakening demand in IT/ITES, with a
services trade surplus
increasing by 6.5 per cent YoY to USD 38 billion.
Consequently, the CAB is expected to register a marginal deficit in 1QFY25.
Merchandise exports grew by 4.9 per cent YoY in 4QFY24, reaching a seven-quarter high of USD 120.4 billion, driven by steady demand from the US, UAE, and the Netherlands.
Significant growth was noted in sectors such as telecom instruments, aircraft and spacecraft parts, chemicals, drug formulations, and jewelry, with volume growth ranging from 2.0 per cent to 66.9 per cent YoY and value growth between 11.7 per cent and 407.9 per cent YoY.
Merchandise imports saw a modest 2.0 per cent YoY increase in 4QFY24, driven primarily by a 21.2 per cent YoY rise in consumer durable goods imports, the highest in six quarters.
Imports of infrastructure and intermediate goods also contributed to this growth. However, imports decreased sequentially to USD 170.7 billion from USD 174.4 billion in the previous quarter.
Notable growth was observed in imports of gold, silver, electronics components, and medical instruments, with value growth ranging from 4.2 per cent to 1,432.0 per cent YoY.
The
Nominal Effective Exchange Rate
(NEER) and
Real Effective Exchange Rate
(REER) indicate a widening gap since FY21, with NEER declining and REER remaining flat.
This divergence suggests increasing inflation differentials between India and its trading partners, eroding India's
export competitiveness
.
Sectors with low entry barriers such as agriculture, textiles, and base metals have been particularly affected, with export growth significantly lagging behind the overall goods exports CAGR of 14.4 per cent during FY21-FY24.
The persistent depreciation of the Indian Rupee (INR) as reflected in NEER, and the flat REER, indicate that inflationary pressures are impacting India's trade dynamics, potentially challenging its long-term export growth in several key sectors.

(CBDC) in the

In the wholesale segment, the outstanding amount stood at ₹8 lakh in March 2024, from ₹10.6 crore last year, and in the retail segment, the amount climbed to ₹234 crore in March 2024, from ₹6 crore last year.
India's CBDC, the

Sharp drop in provisions helped RBI transfer bumper dividend to RBI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/sharp-drop-in-provisions-helped-rbi-transfer-bumper-dividend-to-rbi/articleshow/110566083.cms,31-05-2024,"The
Reserve Bank of India
's income rose 17 percent last fiscal on higher
interest income
from
bond holdings
, but it was the sharp drop in
provisions
transferred to the
Contingency Fund
that helped it pay a record Rs. 2.1 lakh crore in
dividend
to the central government.
An amount of ₹42,819.91 crore was provided towards CF to maintain the Available Realised Equity at the level of 6.50 per cent of the size of the balance sheet. This provision was higher at Rs 1.30,874 crore in FY’2022-23. “ The lower need for provision was because the risk buffers were supported by
revaluation gain
on
foreign securities
due to INR depreciation” said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist at
IDFc First Bank
. “ INR appreciation against USD (and other currencies) results in revaluation loss as
RBI
’s balance sheet is denominated in INR. Increase in gold prices also supported revaluation gains”.
No provision was made towards the Asset Development Fund (ADF). Accordingly, balance in CF as on March 31, 2024 was ₹4,28,621.03 crore as compared to ₹3,51,205.69 crore as on March 31, 2023.On the income side, RBI’s interest income was supported from foreign sources – on foreign securities (such as US treasuries) and interest on deposits. Around 82% of
foreign currency assets
are held as securities and the rest as deposits with other Central banks and BIS. “ RBI’s foreign currency assets increased by 14% in FY24 and the rate of earning also increased 4.2% in FY24 v/s 3.7% in FY23” said Sengupta. Overall Economic Capital (or risk buffers) is tracking at 22.5% of total assets which is well within the recommended range of 20.8-25.4.
Overall RBI’s income in 2023-24 was Rs 2,75,572 crore versus Rs 2,35,467 crore the previous year and its expenditure was sharply lower at Rs 64694 crore due to drop in provisioning versus Rs 1,48,037 crore in expenditure in the previous year. As a result, the central bank could manage to earn a surplus income of RS 2,10,878 crore for FY '2023-24 , which in turn could be transferred to the government.

Timely rescue of firms pushes IBC recovery to 49%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/timely-rescue-of-firms-pushes-ibc-recovery-to-49/articleshow/110543746.cms,30-05-2024,"Creditors
have been able to recover nearly half their claims under the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
(IBC) when the
resolution
has been completed within the 330-day deadline but
delays
lowered the proportion of money they got back. Creditors recovered as much as 49% of claims when the
IBC
process was finished on time but this dropped to 26% when it took 600 days or more, according to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) data. The IBC was introduced eight years ago, in May 2016.
The latest data by the bankruptcy regulator establishes the cost of delays in insolvency resolution, going beyond anecdotal evidence.
Insolvency resolution
holdups, caused mainly by
litigation
, have been the IBC’s gravest challenge, experts said. They called on the government to address this in amendments to the IBC--introduced in May 2016--that are expected to be made once the next government is in place. The IBC by itself isn’t a recovery tool but a law that facilitates the market-driven resolution of
stressed firms
. However, recoveries through this route have often been flagged to gauge its efficacy.
The resolution of 947 stressed companies under the IBC over these years has fetched creditors Rs 3.36 lakh crore, or 32.1% of claims. A company’s insolvency resolution takes an average 679 days, pointing to the scourge of delays.
Timely resolution in each case—within 330 days as per the IBC, including time spent on litigation--could have prevented asset value erosion and sharply raised
recovery prospects
. As of March 2024, resolution in 68% of the ongoing cases has exceeded nine months.
ET Bureau
Live Events
Stakeholders may explore measures such as implementing specialised regimes for specific sectors like real estate, placing greater emphasis on cross-border insolvency and group companies, reviewing timelines under the IBC to ensure greater efficiency and cut delays, said Padmaja Kaul, partner at
IndusLaw
.
“However, all proposed changes must focus on making the IBC a more accountable, transparent and stakeholder-centric framework in alignment with its foundational principles,” Kaul said.
If timing concerns are fixed, the IBC will gain in strength, said Veena Sivaramakrishnan, partner, banking and finance and IBC practice, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.
A formal prepack regime for all companies, backed by IBC principles, will have a positive impact, Sivaramakrishnan said. A prepackaged process involves debtors agreeing with creditors on a resolution process before formal bankruptcy proceedings begin. Currently, this bankruptcy regime, which is more compact than the extant corporate insolvency resolution process, is applicable only to MSMEs.
Sumit Khanna, leader, turnaround and restructuring,
Deloitte India
, pitched for the introduction of a formal insolvency mechanism for group companies to ensure more consistent and effective resolutions. He also called for an effective cross-border insolvency framework.
“The lack of such a framework results in significant value loss for corporate debtors holding assets in foreign jurisdictions where Indian law is inapplicable,” he added.
Resolution, recovery
While stress resolution under the IBC has improved in recent years, recoveries haven’t kept pace. For instance, recoveries by creditors were as high as 54% in both FY18 and FY19 before losing pace, expectedly dropping to 22% in the pandemic year of FY21. It inched up to 23% in FY22 and to 36% in FY23 before losing momentum to 27% in FY24.
The number of resolutions, however, soared to a record 269 in the last fiscal year, against 189 in FY23 and 144 in FY22, driven mainly by the government substantially filling National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) vacancies in the past two years.
Cumulative recoveries by creditors, however, have been more robust relative to the fair value of the stressed companies when they were admitted for insolvency—85%. This also underscores the importance of invoking the IBC on time for stress resolution, experts said. With regard to liquidation value, the recovery rate has been 161.8% of the assets, as per the IBBI data.

The realisation for

from the resolution of stressed companies during the fiscal went down to ₹47,653 crore from ₹55,449 crore in 2022-23, according to the
Insolvency

full-fledged money changers
to ensure that the value of
foreign currency notes

on a quarterly basis.
The

’s directions are effective from July 1, 2024, the

“Data of such sale and purchase should be maintained and made available for audit / inspection,” the RBI said. Central bank norms allow full fledged money changers to obtain their normal business requirements of foreign currency notes from other full fledged money changers and authorised dealers in India.
The banking regulator has also instructed full fledged money changers to submit their annual

Dividend income fuels surge in personal income tax: Motilal Oswal report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/dividend-income-fuels-surge-in-personal-income-tax-motilal-oswal-report/articleshow/110467982.cms,27-05-2024,"A recent report by
Motilal Oswal
has highlighted that
taxes
on
dividend income
have significantly contributed to the
surge
in
personal income tax
(PIT) over the past four years. According to the report, this shift accounts for 60-65% of the growth in PIT, despite a moderation in personal disposable income growth, reported TOI.
The report indicates that the growth in PIT has been robust, increasing at a compounded rate of 20% during FY21-24. By FY24, PIT reached 3.5% of GDP, up from 2.5% in the pre-pandemic period. In contrast, personal disposable income and
GDP
have grown at a more modest rate of less than 10%.
The surge in PIT can be traced back to the 2020-21 Budget announcement by the
finance minister
, which abolished the Dividend Distribution Tax (
DDT
) and introduced the classical system of dividend taxation. Under the new system, companies no longer pay DDT; instead, dividends are taxed in the hands of the recipients at their applicable personal income tax rates.
This policy change shifted the tax burden from corporations to individual taxpayers, significantly impacting the PIT landscape. Previously, DDT was taxed at a rate of 15% (plus surcharges and cess). With the shift, dividends are now subject to the recipient's personal income tax rate, which can be substantially higher.
In FY20, DDT under
corporation taxes
amounted to Rs 50,000 crore or 0.3% of GDP. The report points out that in the United States, 87% of
corporate equities
and mutual fund shares were held by the top 20% of income earners in 2023. A similar trend is likely in India, where high-income earners are subject to a higher tax rate on their dividend income since FY21. Including surcharges, the effective tax rate on dividends can reach 35-40%, double the previous rate.
Live Events
The report estimates that, with an effective tax rate of 36%, taxes on dividends could amount to Rs 1.8-2 lakh crore in FY24, or 0.6-0.7% of GDP. This significant increase in dividend taxation explains much of the rise in PIT. Without considering dividend taxes, the growth in PIT aligns more closely with nominal GDP growth, rising to 2.8% of GDP in FY24 from 2.4% in FY23.

RBI's ₹2 lakh-crore boost may help India's new govt have an easy-peasy run to achieve a goal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-2-lakh-crore-boost-may-help-indias-new-govt-have-an-easy-peasy-run-to-achieve-a-goal/articleshow/110458724.cms,27-05-2024,"The robust
dividend
announced by the Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) may help the newly-elected Indian government meet the 5.1 per cent of GDP deficit target for the fiscal year ending March 2025 (FY25), said
Fitch
Ratings in its latest report on Monday.
It further stated that the
dividend income
could be used to lower the deficit beyond the current target.
The RBI on May 22 announced a record-high dividend transfer to the government, equivalent to 0.6 per cent of GDP (Rs 2.1 lakh) from its operations in FY24. The figure has surpassed the 0.3 per cent of GDP expected in the FY25 budget from February. Hence, the rating agency said that it will aid the authorities in meeting near-term deficit reduction goals.
Although the detailed breakdown by RBI is awaited, Fitch termed the higher interest revenue on foreign assets as a significant driver of the higher RBI profits.
The new government’s budget, following the release of election results in June, is likely to be presented in July and it will determine how the
dividend
will be used.
Live Events
Agencies
Source: Fitch Rating Agency
Govt aims to...
The government had signalled its aim to narrow the deficit gradually to 4.5 per cent of GDP by FY26. RBI-led
Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) member Ashima Goyal had said that she sees potential for a slight reduction in the targeted
fiscal deficit
for the current year, suggesting that India could comfortably achieve its fiscal consolidation goals.
""Sustained deficit reduction, particularly if underpinned by durable revenue-raising reforms, would be positive for India’s sovereign rating fundamentals over the medium term,"" Fitch said in its report.
The Fitch report cited two alternatives which can be used by the newly-formed government in its post-election budget.
First, the government could opt to keep the current deficit target for FY25, and the windfall could allow the authorities to further boost spending on infrastructure, or to offset upside spending surprises or lower-than-budgeted revenue, for example from divestment. Alternatively, all or part of the windfall could be saved, pushing the deficit to below 5.1 per cent of GDP.
The choice by the new government will provide a clarity around its medium-term fiscal priorities.
A Reuters report stated that the incoming government has two primary avenues to consider for utilising the surplus: reducing the fiscal deficit or increasing public expenditure. Each option has distinct implications for different sectors of the economy.
Reducing the deficit
: Economists argue that channeling the surplus towards deficit reduction could be beneficial for India's sovereign ratings. According to Citi Research's Samiran Chakraborty, using the funds to cut the fiscal deficit could bring it down by 0.3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). This approach is likely to be favored by bond markets, which would see a decline in yields, as already indicated by a recent drop in bond yields following the surplus announcement.
Increasing public expenditure
: Alternatively, the government could boost spending on infrastructure or introduce populist measures. Equity markets would likely support this route, as increased spending can stimulate economic activity and growth. The Sensex’s rise by 1,300 points in response to the surplus news underscored investor optimism about potential expenditure increases.
Transfers from RBI to the government can be significant at the margin for fiscal performance, however it depends on various factors, including the size and performance of assets held on the central bank’s balance sheet and India’s exchange rate.
Transfers may also be influenced by the RBI’s views on what level of buffer is appropriate to maintain on its own balance sheet. ""The potential volatility of transfers means there is significant uncertainty about their medium-term path, and we do not anticipate that dividends as a share of GDP will be sustained at such a high level,"" said Fitch.
A cheque worth Rs 2 lk cr for new govt
On June 4, India will usher in a newly elected government, and with it, a significant financial boon awaits: a surplus transfer of Rs 2.11 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This windfall presents a strategic opportunity for the new administration to shape the country’s fiscal landscape over the next eight months. Economists and investors alike are speculating on how this substantial amount could be utilised.
ET Online
In the run-up to the elections, different political parties have laid out their fiscal visions. The
Congress
has promised substantial
welfare measures
, including annual cash handouts to women and jobless youth, and a commission to waive farmers' debts. In contrast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the
Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) have refrained from making similar populist promises, focusing instead on infrastructure development.
According to a Reuters report, Shreya Sodhani, an economist at
Barclays
, noted that despite the higher revenue from the
RBI dividend
, a BJP-led government might not opt for increased populist expenditure. The BJP’s recent budgets have prioritised
infrastructure spending
over welfare programs, even in an election year. For instance, the final pre-election budget significantly increased infrastructure expenditure to Rs 11.11 lakh crore, three times the amount spent in 2019.
Economists suggest that using the surplus to reduce the fiscal deficit could have long-term benefits for India's sovereign ratings. S&P Global Ratings Analyst YeeFarn Phua pointed out that the additional dividends from the RBI, amounting to around 0.35 per cent of GDP, could support fiscal consolidation if directed towards deficit reduction. This would potentially improve India's sovereign rating over time, currently affirmed at 'BBB-' with a stable outlook by S&P.
The new government is expected to present the final budget in July, leaving eight months to allocate and utilise the funds. Despite slow expenditure in the lead-up to the elections, robust
tax collections
indicate a strong economic performance. In April 2024, the government collected a record Rs 2.10 lakh crore in goods and services taxes (GST), reflecting buoyant economic activity.

"Govt's cash balance surges, banks starve",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/govts-cash-balance-surges-banks-starve/articleshow/110444996.cms,27-05-2024,"Mumbai: The ongoing general
elections
have thrown up a problem of plenty for the government - its cash balances are much higher than before the previous two Lok Sabha polls, but curbs on
spending
mean that
banks
are parched of
funds
while the Centre tries hard to prevent the money from sitting idle.
The adoption of more efficient fund management practices by the Centre, healthy
tax collections
and a build-up of cash by state governments have resulted in overall government cash balances swelling past ₹3 lakh crore and locking out funds from the banking sector.
As a result of the constraints on spending during a long-drawn national election, government expenditure - which traditionally flows through banks - has moderated, leading to a tight money market and, consequently, higher borrowing costs.
""Government cash surplus - Centre-plus-states - is currently tracking at ₹2.5 lakh crore as on May 17, which is significantly higher than the same period last year at ₹1.4 lakh crore as of May 19, 2023,"" said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist at

The government's cash balances have likely crossed the ₹3 lakh crore mark after the latest round of goods and services tax (GST) collections.
As of May 16, 2014, just a few days after the general elections that year, the cash balance of the Centre and states was at a deficit of ₹94,000 crore, implying that government expenditure was in full swing.
The matter has been compounded by the strides taken by the Centre in the adoption of 'just-in-time' cash management. While the relatively new practice has yielded greater efficiency in
cash management
for the government, it has left banks starved of the huge float of
liquidity
they earlier enjoyed as the Centre now releases funds on the specified date unlike in the past when it would transfer funds weeks in advance.
""Another factor for accumulation of large cash surplus (this year versus previous election years) is better cash management by the Centre with the implementation of just-in-time cash management for expenditure on schemes - central sector schemes and centrally sponsored schemes,"" Sengupta said.
Over the past year, the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has often spoken about how the ebb and flow of government expenditure has a major exogenous impact on liquidity conditions in the banking system. From May 1 to May 23, daily average deficit liquidity, as measured by banks' borrowings from the
RBI
, was at ₹1.4 lakh crore, the latest central bank data showed.
The RBI has taken steps to infuse liquidity, with the central bank having held eight rounds of fine-tuning variable rate repo operations and two rounds of main 14-day repo operations so far in May.
The government, on the other hand, has also been trying to buy back some of its outstanding bonds, so as to make good use of the large cash balance it is sitting on and bring down interest costs. However, these operations have been largely unsuccessful as the Centre and its debt manager - the RBI - have been unwilling to buy back bonds at high prices from banks.
In 2021, the government began a new model of cash management - the
Single Nodal Agency
(SNA). This involved an SNA account set up with banks for central sector and centrally sponsored programmes. Under this model, funds sit in the account for some time before payouts are made.
The Centre has now moved toward a model called the SNA SPARSH, which aims to bring about just-in-time releases for centrally sponsored programmes and central and state consolidated funds.

This substantial financial aid aims to address the state's pressing economic needs and facilitate the execution of critical projects for the
welfare
of its citizens.
While announcing the assistance, Minister Chandrasekhar emphasized the importance of utilizing the allocated funds efficiently and transparently.
He urged Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to ensure that the funds are utilized judiciously for the welfare of the people, without any instances of leakages or corruption.
""I urge @pinarayivijayan to use funds properly for the welfare of the people of Kerala, without any leakages & corruption,"" the Minister added.
In addition to the
financial assistance
, Minister Chandrasekhar called upon the Kerala government to take immediate action on key initiatives to address the state's economic challenges effectively.
Payment of salaries and pensions for government employees, including those of Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) employees, who have been facing financial hardships due to delayed payments.
Execution of the
Coastal Protection
and the Mini Harbour Project, vital infrastructure projects aimed at safeguarding coastal areas and promoting maritime activities.
Completion of the ongoing recruitment process for the Coastal Police Officers (CPO), ensuring the reinforcement of coastal security measures.
Acceleration of pending development projects, particularly focusing on Thiruvananthapuram, to spur economic growth and enhance infrastructure in the region.
Earlier,
Kerala Finance Minister
KN Balagopal had expressed concerns that there has been a reduction in the percentage of funds that the southern state is getting from the Centre.
""The funds collected by the Union (government) increased 11 times during this period but the increase in tax to Kerala is only 8.8 times which means there is a sharp decline. So the reduction is huge and that is why states like Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, and West Bengal are raising this issue,"" Balagopal said.
Kerala Finance Minister further stated that the state government is facing a shortage of funds to meet the expenditure for its social schemes.""We are facing the problem of giving minimum necessary things as well. We have to give pensions to 62 lakh families who were entitled to one. However, the release of these pensions are getting delayed because of lack of payments from the Union,"" he added.

"Most SFBs would not clamour to become universal banks if RBI eases some curbs, says ex-Secy",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/most-sfbs-would-not-clamour-to-become-universal-banks-if-rbi-eases-some-curbs-says-ex-secy/articleshow/110438040.cms,26-05-2024,"New Delhi: Highlighting the importance of
small finance banks
(SFBs) in fostering
financial inclusion
, former
Financial Services
Secretary D K Mittal said most of them would not clamour to become
universal banks
if some restrictions are eased by the Reserve Bank.
To promote financial inclusion in the country, RBI, in 2014, issued the guidelines for licensing of small finance banks (SFBs) in the private sector. Following this,
RBI
granted licences to a dozen entities.
As per the
RBI guidelines
, SFBs are required to open at least 25 per cent of their branches in unbanked rural centres and are mandated to provide 75 per cent of loans to the
priority sector
compared to 40 per cent for the commercial banks.
Last month, the RBI invited applications from small finance banks meeting specified criteria, including a minimum net worth of Rs 1,000 crore, for becoming regular or universal banks.
""While issuing guidelines for Small Finance Banks to become universal banks, it would be in the larger national interest of financial inclusion if RBI lifts some of the restrictions imposed on such SFBs including tag of SFBs,"" he told
PTI

Talking about restrictions, he said, the RBI should consider allowing co-lending, pass through certificate (PTC) and securitisation, and setting up of subsidiaries.
Idea should be to make them at par with commercial banks except for three basic principles of priority sector, below 25 lakh and Basel II for capital, he said, adding that these should work as universal banks with a differentiated focus on financial inclusion.
""After all they comply with all guidelines applicable to universal banks except a few related to capital but with additional responsibility of 75 per cent priority sector and 50 per cent below Rs 25 lakh lending. This will ensure that customers look at all commercial banks as equal which is so,"" he said.
""If it is done, they would be as good as a universal bank with the added responsibility of furthering the objective of financial inclusion and serving the population of the lowest strata of society. This will also ensure that most SFBs would not clamour to become universal banks,"" he added.
As per the April guidelines of the RBI, an
SFB
aiming to become a universal bank should have a minimum net worth of Rs 1,000 crore at the end of the previous quarter (audited) and the shares of the bank should have been listed on a recognised stock exchange.
It should also have a net profit in the last two financial years and Gross NPA and Net NPA of less than or equal to 3 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, in the last two financial years.
Other conditions include a prescribed CRAR (capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio) requirement and a satisfactory track record of performance for a minimum period of five years.

Rejig of riches: Study moots robin hood tax for equality,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rejig-of-riches-study-moots-robin-hood-tax-for-equality/articleshow/110406954.cms,25-05-2024,"New Delhi: A new study co-authored by economist
Thomas Piketty
suggests
India
should impose a
wealth tax
on the
ultra-rich
to tackle
inequality
and create fiscal space for investments in the
social sector
.
The paper, released on Friday, suggests imposing a 2% annual tax on net wealth over ₹10 crore, and a 33% inheritance tax on estates exceeding ₹10 crore in valuation. This could generate
revenue
amounting to 2.73% of gross domestic product (
GDP
), it said.
According to the paper, Towards Tax Justice & Wealth Redistribution in India: Proposals, based on the latest inequality estimates, 0.04% of the adult population holds more than a quarter of total wealth, and imposing this tax would leave 99.96% unaffected. ""Progressive wealth
taxation
, effective redistribution, and broad-based social sector investments are urgently needed to build an equitable and prosperous India,"" said
Anmol Somanchi
, one of the four authors of the report.
Near Doubling of
Public Spending
The other three authors are Piketty, Nitin Kumar Bharti and Lucas Chancel. Bharti, lead author of the study, noted that this may also help establish trust, as it would put the money to more transparent use. ""To develop trust among the rich, the government could transparently allocate the wealth tax revenues towards social sector spending - such as improving the quality of public schools and hospitals - which will lead to a more educated and healthy labour force,"" Bharti noted in response to
ET
's queries.

The additional revenue generated would allow a near doubling of the current public spending on
education
and other social sectors, closer to the 6% of GDP target the government has envisaged.
Calculations
The study outlines baseline, moderate and ambitious projections.
""In that respect, besides addressing extreme wealth inequality, such taxes could also play a small role in weakening the rigid link between social and economic inequalities in India,"" Somanchi said in the study. ""For example, the baseline scenario would allow nearly doubling the current public spending on education, which has stagnated at 2.9% of GDP over the past 15 years, well below - less than half - the 6% target set by the government's own
National Education Policy 2020
(NEP 2020).""
The moderate scenario envisages 4.59% of GDP in additional tax revenues, with a higher 4% annual tax kicking in for people with over Rs 100 crore net wealth and 45% inheritance tax. The ambitious tax regime envisages a 3% and 5% annual tax on those with net wealth over Rs 10 crore and Rs 100 crore, respectively. Additionally, it places 45% and 55% duty on estates, amounting to tax collection of 6.08% of GDP.

RBI dividend to have limited impact on medium-term fiscal consolidation: Fitch,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-dividend-to-have-limited-impact-on-medium-term-fiscal-consolidation-fitch/articleshow/110406595.cms,24-05-2024,"New Delhi: A larger-than-expected
surplus transfer
by the
RBI
will have a limited impact on India's
medium-term fiscal consolidation
,
Fitch Ratings
said Friday.
""While supportive of near-term fiscal performance, the one-off nature of the dividend, however, means the medium-term impact of this windfall on India's consolidation and debt path will be limited,"" said Jeremy Zook, director,
Fitch
Ratings'
Asia-Pacific Sovereigns
team. The ratings agency noted that a positive rating impact would rather be dependent on sustained deficit reduction owing to
revenue-raising reforms
.
""Sustained deficit reduction, particularly if underpinned by durable revenue-raising reforms, would be positive for the rating fundamentals over the medium term,"" Zook said. The government has set a target of bringing the fiscal deficit down to 4.5% of the GDP by FY26. For FY25, it had set a target of 5.1% of the GDP in the interim budget. The
RBI board
earlier this week announced a ₹2.11 lakh crore surplus transfer to the government, which experts note is expected to provide an extra 0.4% of GDP space to the government.
""The use of the dividend-whether it is saved or used for additional spending-could provide a signal around the
government's fiscal priorities
,"" Zook noted.
Moody's Ratings analysts
note that the windfall can also be used for policies and initiatives the new government plans to launch. ""The government could preserve expenditure restraint and facilitate further progress towards meeting its deficit target while lowering borrowing requirements that could, in turn, free up liquidity in the market for other purposes; the government could also deploy these extra funds towards new policies and initiatives,"" said Christian de Guzman, senior vice president, Moody's Ratings. On Thursday, an S&P Ratings analyst said the extra funds could provide rating support over time if it leads to a full decrease in the deficit. Experts have been factoring in a 0.2% reduction in fiscal deficit, given slippages in revenue collection and additional allocation to expenditures. All three ratings agencies have retained India's rating with a stable outlook.
In its January review, Fitch noted that ""implementation of a credible medium-term fiscal strategy, for instance, from further revenue-enhancing reforms, which lowers the general government debt and interest/revenue ratio towards the levels of 'BBB' category peers"" could affect ratings positively.

Finance Ministry
on Friday released its
economic review
for the month of April, touching on the Met's monsoon prediction, inflation, debt sustainaility, and
geopolitical tensions
.
""The prediction of a normal
Southwest Monsoon
also augers well for
food production
and easing of
price pressures
. With the assumption of normal monsoon, the RBI forecasts a 4.9%
retail inflation
for FY25’s first quarter,"" the
FinMin
said.
In its review, the Finance Ministry also reiterated its faith in India's ability to deal with adverse pressures from geopolitical tensions, while continuing to make progress on its growth numbers.
""The positive indications in the
farm sector
should help India firewall against any adverse pressures that may arise from geopolitical tensions and
global commodity prices
,"" the review from the Finance Ministry added.
April's report also addressed concerns about debt sustainability, with the report saying ""robust trends in the capital spending of the general government during April-February of FY24"" have ""laid to rest concerns about debt sustainability.""
Live Events
""Likewise, the strong
macro-economic buffers
of India should help the
real sectors
of the economy navigate the external headwinds smoothly and continue the growth momentum of the previous year,"" the report adds.
Amid a poll battle on unemployment, the BJP government's monthly review termed job trends ""reassuring,"" saying that, ""while the urban unemployment rate declined y-o-y during the quarter ending March 2024, the labour force participation rate and worker-topopulation ratio have improved.""
The Finance Ministry's review for April also talked of India's inflation trajectory, saying that it would be influenced by several factors, including government initiatives, open market sales, monitoring of stocks, import of pulses, and export restrictions.
Friday's report also cautioned of ""ongoing geopolitical tensions"" that ""could potentially driveup international commodity prices and disrupt supply chains.""
Addressing India's currency performance, the report said foreign exchange reserves are comfortable, calling the Indian rupee ""one of the most resilient vis-à-vis the US dollar in recent months.""
The Finance Ministry's statement comes even as the Indian rupee strengthened by the most in five months, as the country’s key equities gauges hit a record high and amid a larger-than-expected dividend payout to the government.
On Friday, the rupee rose as much as 0.3% to 83.03 against the dollar, the most since December 15, as markets reopened after being shut on Thursday.

Dalal Street cheered this bumper surplus transfer from Mint Street, as Sensex rose as much as 1,300 points. Bond yields too declined.
The surplus fund can help the new government bring down its fiscal deficit by 0.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) or increase spending on infrastructure or ""populist"" stimulus, Reuters reported Citi Research's Samiran Chakraborty as saying.

India to get rating support if it uses RBI dividend to reduce fiscal deficit: S&P analyst
""The bond markets would likely hope that the government follows the deficit reduction route, while the equity markets would likely prefer the government taking the expenditure increase one,"" said Chakraborty.
ALSO READ: Swaminathan Aiyar wonders how RBI managed to give Rs 2.1 lakh cr dividend to govt, says it will make a huge difference to July Budget
In the run-up to the elections, the
Congress
pledged annual cash handouts of Rs 1 lakh to impoverished women and jobless youth. Additionally, Rahul Gandhi vowed to set up a '
karza maafi commission
', to waive farmers' debts.
However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the
Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) has not given any indications of offering welfare sops, despite a stronger sense of coming back to power for the third consecutive term.
""Despite higher revenue from the
RBI dividend
, we doubt the government would opt for more populist expenditure in its budget, if the government is BJP-led. The current government has not shown a disposition towards populist spending even in an election year,"" said Shreya Sodhani, an economist at
Barclays
.
The government led by the BJP refrained from splurging trillions of rupees on welfare programs for the underprivileged in its final budget before the election. Instead, it augmented infrastructure expenditure to Rs 11.11 lakh crore, exceeding three times the amount spent in 2019.
Sovereign rating support
Economists feel that if India uses the money to reduce its fiscal deficit, overtime, it will help with India's sovereign ratings.
""The additional dividends from the RBI are around 0.35 per cent of GDP. Whether it would support the narrowing of the fiscal deficit in fiscal 2024-25 would really depend on the final budget that would be passed after the June election results,"" S&P Global Ratings Analyst YeeFarn Phua told PTI.
The additional dividend from the RBI may not necessarily lead to a full decrease in the deficit due to potential revenue shortfalls in areas like divestment receipts or additional allocation to expenditures in the final budget, Phua said in an email interview from Singapore.
However, ""if it does lead to a full decrease of the deficit, we believe it will lead to a faster path of fiscal consolidation that, in turn, will provide rating support over time"", Phua added.
In May last year, S&P Global Ratings affirmed India's sovereign rating at 'BBB-' with a stable outlook on growth but flagged weak fiscal performance and low GDP per capita as risks.
'BBB-' is the lowest investment grade rating.
Fiscal deficit in control?
Keeping with the tradition, it is anticipated that the new government will unveil the final budget in July, granting them merely eight months to utilise allocated funds.
With elections commencing in April, government expenditure has been sluggish. However, robust
tax collections
reflect the buoyant state of the economy.
In April 2024, Centre collected Rs 2.10 lakh crore in goods and services taxes (GST), a record high.
India is targeting to achieve fiscal deficit of 5.1 per cent of GDP for the year. This suggests that the government might prioritize fiscal consolidation using the substantial dividend.
Reuters reported that Monetary Policy Committee Member Ashima Goyal sees a scope for a slight reduction in the targeted fiscal deficit for the current year.
Eventually, India wants to bring down fiscal deficit to 4.5 per cent of GDP by FY26. Goyal feels India could do so comfortably.

""We are currently engaged in discussions with India to explore avenues for facilitating payments in rupees,"" the minister said.
An India-Maldives joint statement during the official visit of the then President of Maldives Ibrahim Mohamed Solih to India in August 2022 said: ""The two leaders welcomed the ongoing work to operationalize the usage of
Rupay Cards
in Maldives and agreed to consider further measures to boost bilateral travel and tourism and economic inter-linkages.""
Over the last few years, multiple banks and payment companies from across various countries have partnered with NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the international arm of NPCI, to accept UPI and RuPay in one form or the other.
Ever since the pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu assumed power last November, the relations between the Maldives and India have soured. The repatriation of 80 plus Indian military personnel manning three aviation platforms earlier this month from the archipelago nation at his insistence has left a bitter note on bilateral ties.

RBI's record dividend invites mixed reactions from economists,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-record-dividend-invites-mixed-reactions-from-economists/articleshow/110370758.cms,23-05-2024,"The
Reserve Bank of India
's (RBI) decision to declare its highest-ever dividend of Rs 2.11 lakh crore evoked mixed reactions from economists. While noted economist Suman Mukherjee hailed it as a sign of
economic strength
, Abhirup Sarkar expressed worries that the dividend could restrict the
RBI
's ability to rescue lenders in future as the central bank might not have enough money to step in immediately.
""This is not a fluke,"" Mukherjee told PTI, attributing the windfall to a confluence of factors including a surge in
foreign exchange reserves
, loans to commercial banks and the
government's proactive approach
in managing contingencies.
He highlighted that the positive impact of RBI development is evident on the
stock market
ending in a record high.
Mukherjee downplayed concerns about rising
interest rates
, suggesting that focus on maintaining low rates will counter potential recessionary effects.
However, Abhirup Sarkar, another noted economist and a former professor at the
Indian Statistical Institute
, expresses reservations.

RBI's Rs 2.1 lakh crore payout: When it all adds up to deliver a windfall to govt,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-rs-2-1-lakh-crore-payout-when-it-all-adds-up-to-deliver-a-windfall-to-govt/articleshow/110342446.cms,23-05-2024,"If the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) had private shareholders, as it had before 1949, they would have been a happy lot on Wednesday evening. The old lady of Mint Street will deliver its bounty from the
financial markets
- by far the most generous
payout
it has ever made - to New Delhi. At a time when some of the central banks in the advanced world have reported losses and negative equity,
RBI
will hand over a
dividend
cheque of more than ₹2.1 lakh crore to its sole owner, the
government
.
However, the optics of the event - a monetary authority headed by a former bureaucrat making a huge transfer to a macho government towards the end of a long, noisy general election - masks a more prosaic truth. The payout number is a function of local and offshore currency and money markets, coupled with RBI's active intervention in the foreign exchange market.
FY24 WAS DIFFERENT
What contributed to RBI's higher earnings? First, the higher returns from $469 billion investments in sovereign securities of the first-world governments - of which US treasury bills account for about $250 billion. The
interest income
from these risk-free bonds (which are part of the
forex reserves
kitty along with gold which earns nothing), has been distinctly higher in FY24 (at almost 4% returns from US T-bills) compared with the previous year.
Second, the interest earned from short-term lending to liquidity-starved commercial banks - a transaction commonly called repo (or repurchase agreement). Unlike in FY23 when there was 'surplus liquidity' in the local money market - driving banks to park extra funds with
RBI
- it was largely a 'deficit' situation in FY24, pushing banks to borrow from RBI. Thus, as against in FY23 when RBI had to pay interest to banks (under reverse repo), in FY24 it received interest from banks (under repo).
Live Events
Third, the gains booked by the RBI through its 'gross sale' of
dollars
.
THE DOLLAR SALE STORY
It's the last source of gains that appears to have made a difference, resulting in doubling the size of the dividend from what was stated in the government's interim budget on February 1.
Every dollar the RBI sells from its basket of forex reserves to cushion the rupee earns a 'profit', which is the difference between the prevailing rupee/dollar exchange rate at which the dollar is sold and the average cost (of the exchange rates) at which it had bought dollars at different points in the past.
Suppose, this average cost or purchase price is 78 and it sells dollars at 83, RBI makes a gain of ₹5 for each dollar sold. Given a gross sale of over $150 billion in FY24, a sizeable part of the dividend is explained by a series of such transactions which were primarily done to generate the payout amount.
The story is better captured in the RBI's 'net purchase' (as opposed to the 'gross sale'). Net purchase is the difference between gross purchase and gross sale of dollars in the forex spot market. With a balance of payment surplus in FY24, RBI made a 'net purchase' of $41 billion.
RBI sells dollars to support the rupee when the currency comes under pressure. Hypothetically, if there is a $5-billion shortage, RBI can either directly sell $5 billion to add to the dollar supply; or, it can sell $25 billion and buy back $20 billion, to generate a net supply (or sale) of $5 billion. It's the latter which RBI did during the year. Why? Because gains can be booked through gross sales - the higher the gross sale, the higher the gains from dollar sales, and more is the elbow room to declare a bigger dividend.
WHAT ABOUT FY25?
All this, however, diminishes the scope to post similar gains and the opportunity to offer large dividends in subsequent years. Why? When RBI does large dollar purchases (on the back of large gross sales) as it did in FY24, the average cost of dollars in the reserves basket rises. As it buys more and more dollars at the current rates of 82 or 83, the average cost of the reserves inches up from 78 to a higher number, say, 80. So, unless the rupee further falls this year, it would be difficult to book similar gains in FY25. Will that make it tougher for Shaktikanta Das's successor to announce an impressive dividend next year?
There are too many moving pieces for an easy answer. Will earnings from other sources come down? Will the market turn volatile? Will more from the reserves have to be set aside as buffers?
Das's team has been conservative in building a higher buffer against contingent risks (at the upper band of 6.5% of the book compared to the permissible range of 5.5-6.5%). The
central bank
also has to provide for economic capital, which is linked to volatility and calculated by a dynamic model. This too is understood to have been raised by some notches from the historical level of 20.5%.
Buoyed by higher yields in global markets and aggressive forex sales, Das has done his bit. Now, it's up to the
North Block
whether to bet on a lower fiscal deficit or higher spending.

Rs 2.1 lakh crore: RBI’s record dividend swells govt coffers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rs-2-1-lakh-crore-rbis-record-dividend-swells-govt-coffers/articleshow/110342374.cms,23-05-2024,"Mumbai/New Delhi: The
Reserve Bank
of India (
RBI
) on Wednesday said it would pay a record
dividend
of `2.1 lakh crore for FY24 — more than double the amount the Centre had budgeted for — as Mint Road made windfall
interest
gains from its overseas investments.
The benchmark bond yield retreated below 7% on expectations that New Delhi would now need to borrow less this fiscal year.
“The higher dividend is welcome, of course,” finance secretary TV Somanathan told ET. “It exceeds our estimate by 0.2-0.3% of GDP.”
In the interim budget, North Block had factored in receipts of Rs 1.05 lakh crore under dividends and profits.
The record central bank
surplus
transfer would help push New Delhi’s resource envelope in FY25, allowing for either enhanced expenditures or a sharper fiscal consolidation than what was baked into the pre-polls budget passed in February, said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at rating agency
Icra
. “Increasing the funds available for capex would certainly boost the quality of the fiscal deficit,” she said, pointing to the need for the Centre to borrow less money
Live Events
But a shorter time window after the formation of the new
government
might make it difficult to fully deploy the additional funds this fiscal year itself, Nayar added.
The probability of a narrower fiscal gap caused cheer in Mumbai's bond market. Yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond closed four basis points lower at 6.99%. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Bond prices and yields move inversely. Government bonds are the pricing benchmarks for a host of credit products in the economy.
Last fiscal year, the
dividend payout
amounted to Rs 87,416 crore, including dividends from public sector banks and other undertakings. The government has a borrowing target of more than Rs 14 lakh crore for FY25, with slightly more than half the amount expected to be garnered in the first half.
“The large
RBI dividend
is likely supported by interest
income
on foreign
securities
and rupee securities. RBI’s foreign currency assets rose by 13.8% year-on-year in FY24 (till March 29), led by forex reserves accumulation,” said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist at
IDFC First Bank
.
INTEREST INCOMES
The unexpected gains are largely attributed to higher interest income on Mint Road’s holdings of bonds and securities, making good the decline in commission income from dollar sales during the year. Of the $646 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves as of March 2024, $409 billion was parked in securities in top rated sovereign instruments, RBI data showed.
Yields on benchmark bonds in the developed markets have risen by 300-400 basis points over the previous year, automatically translating into a sharp rise in interest income from investments in these securities.
The surplus amount was arrived at on the basis of the
Economic Capital Framework
(ECF) adopted by the central bank on August 26, 2019, in accordance with recommendations of the expert committee to review the economic capital framework.
Chaired by former central bank governor Bimal Jalan, the panel had recommended the risk provisioning under the contingent risk buffer (CRB) be maintained within a range of 6.5 to 5.5% of the RBI’s balance sheet.
“As the economy remains robust and resilient, the board has decided to increase the CRB to 6.50% for FY24,” RBI said in a statement. Its economic capital (or risk buffer) in FY24 is tracking at 25.5% of total assets as of March 29, showed estimates by IDFC First Bank. This is higher than the recommended range of 20.8-25.4%.
LOWER PROVISIONS
“The RBI balance sheet didn’t change much, and the need for provisioning was lower. This was one of the most important reasons why the dividend inflow was large,” said Anubhuti Sahay, head of South Asia economic research at
Standard Chartered Bank
. “The total income RBI generated in FY24 was much, much larger than what we expected. We expected a slight dip in income because the gross dollar sales in FY24 were lower than in FY23, but they most probably booked higher profits per dollar and interest earnings.”

RBI buys 1.5 times more gold in January-April than whole of 2023,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-buys-1-5-times-more-gold-in-january-april-than-whole-of-2023/articleshow/110340250.cms,23-05-2024,"The
Reserve Bank of India
added 24 tonnes of
gold
to its stock of
reserves
in four months from January to April this year as a hedge against volatility amid
geopolitical tensions
. This is reckoned to be a part of strategic diversification of reserves in challenging times.
This is almost one and a half times the volume it did during the whole of 2023 when it added 16 tonnes to its reserves an analysis of the Reserve Bank data indicates.
The Reserve Bank held 827. 69 tonnes worth of gold as a part of its
foreign exchange
reserves as of April 26,2024, up from 803.6 tonnes as of end December according to the latest Reserve bank of India data.
Though India has been one of the largest consumers of gold as far as the Indian household is concerned, the country’s
central bank
was rarely active in piling its gold reserves. It came in for heavy criticism when it had pledged a part of its
gold reserves
in 1991 when it faced foreign exchange crisis. Though all the gold is back in the central bank’s coffers, it started adding to its stocks from
market purchases
only from December 2017. Though it was seen actively buying from the markets in 2022, it was lying low in 2023 only to come back aggressively since January this year.
Agencies
The share of gold in the total foreign exchange reserves increased from 7.75 per cent as at end- December 2023 to about 8.7 per cent as at end-April 2024. In addition to volumes, the central bank is also making valuation gains because of steady increase in
gold prices

The Reserve Bank, like most other emerging market central banks, is diversifying its reserves as a hedge against
currency volatility
. “ The heightened
global uncertainty
is sending emerging market central
banks on a spree of gold buying, adding 290 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024 and accounting for a quarter of overall global gold demand” said an assessment of the state of the economy by the Reserve bank economists published in its latest monthly bulletin.
“ Amid geopolitical developments and a slowing global economy, these central banks are signaling that living in challenging times calls for strategic diversification”, it said.
As an asset gold’s age-old credential is in its character as ‘store of value”. “ Last year central banks placed great emphasis on gold’s value in crisis response, diversification attributes and store-of-value credentials” said a senior analyst at the
World Gold council
a in note. “ A few months into 2024 the world seems no less uncertain meaning those reasons for owning gold are as relevant as ever”.

Net financial savings rose to 6% in FY24: Goldman Sachs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/net-financial-savings-rose-to-6-in-fy24-goldman-sachs/articleshow/110340024.cms,22-05-2024,"A faster increase in household deposit growth likely pushed net
financial savings
to 6% of
GDP
in FY24 from 5.1% in the previous year,
Goldman Sachs
said in a report on Wednesday.
“This (increase in net financial savings) is mainly driven by our estimate of higher gross financial
savings
of 12.5% of GDP (vs 11.0% of GDP in FY 2023) owing to our estimate of higher bank deposit growth,” it said.
The global investment bank’s research unit noted that gross financial savings are expected to outpace the increase in household financial liabilities in FY24.
Goldman Sachs has predicted a rise in household liabilities to 6.6% of GDP in FY24 from 5.9% in the previous year.
Rising household liabilities was one of the primary factors for the decline in net financial savings, as they jumped 1.7 times from the previous year.

The investment bank, in its research, highlighted the trend of financialisation of household savings, which it said could help fund the capex cycle without affecting the current account deficit.
The research noted that increasing financial literacy, digitalisation, formalisation and performance of equity markets were reasons for the switch.
“The overall AUM of retirement savings, insurance, and mutual funds grew at a 15% CAGR, outpacing bank deposit CAGR of 9% over the last ten years,” it said, pointing out that levels would still be lower than developed nations and Asian giants like Korea and Taiwan.
The research also pointed to increased investment in retirements and pension funds as a factor which has curbed volatility by keeping government bond yields flat.
However, it noted a need for further development of corporate market to take advantage of this trend.
“It is important that the quasi-government / corporate bond market is incentivised to move towards long-dated issuance, to channel the long-term savings towards infrastructure asset creation,” it said.

liquidity deficit
of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.41 billion) so far in May.
The government, meanwhile, has seen strong
tax revenue
due to a
buoyant economy
.
While the government could choose to cut borrowings, this is last option, said a second source aware of the government's thinking, adding that options such as buybacks may be preferable for now.
A cut in borrowings can only be decided on when a new government is in place and the final budget for the year is presented, the first source said. (

India may raise FY25 CPSE dividend target in full budget,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-may-raise-fy25-cpse-dividend-target-in-full-budget/articleshow/110294287.cms,21-05-2024,"The
finance ministry
is likely to raise the CPSE
dividend estimates
by Rs 5,000 crore to around
Rs 53,000 crore
for the
current fiscal
in the
full budget
to be presented in July. In the
interim budget
2024-25, the
government
had pegged dividend estimates from non-financial central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) at Rs 48,000 crore for the current fiscal.
""The estimates may go up by about Rs 5,000 crore in the final budget to be presented in July,"" an official told PTI.
The interim budget estimates were based on the estimates in December 2023, and January 2024, and the estimates in the full budget will be higher as we have a better picture of the dividend now, the official added.
The
dividend receipts
of the government in a particular fiscal include interim dividends announced by state-owned companies during the fiscal, as well as final dividends for the previous fiscal. So far in the current financial year, the government has obtained Rs 4,837.25 crore as dividends from the CPSEs.
This includes Rs 3,443 crore as a special dividend from
Telecommunications Consultants India Limited
(TCIL), a public sector enterprise under the
Ministry of Telecom

Centre may get around ₹1 lakh crore in RBI dividend,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-may-get-around-1-lakh-crore-in-rbi-dividend/articleshow/110254766.cms,20-05-2024,"Recent actions by the
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) suggest that it may transfer a higher
dividend
- possibly in the region of ₹1 lakh crore - to the
government
than last year, giving a potential boost to New Delhi's
finances
.
Last week, the RBI announced a steep cut in the government's borrowing through
Treasury Bills
, reducing the amount of funds that the Centre would have garnered through these short-term instruments by ₹60,000 crore.
The
central bank
also took some measures to ensure greater success of an upcoming operation where the government plans to prematurely pay back ₹60,000 crore of earlier borrowings.
Both these actions, which seek to utilise government funds that are currently sitting idle due to election-related constraints on spending, also hint that the Centre's finances may soon be handsomely replenished.
The RBI, which is the government's debt manager, is likely to announce the transfer of its surplus funds to the government in late May.

""We expect the RBI to transfer a surplus of INR 1,000 billion (₹1 lakh crore) to the government in FY25... while there are many moving parts in the
RBI dividend
calculation, our assessment shows a likely repeat of a strong dividend number,""
Union Bank of India
's chief economic advisor, Kanika Pasricha, recently said in a research note.
Earnings from
Foreign Assets
Calculations conducted by analysts based on public information about the RBI's balance sheet make a case for the central bank to surpass the
surplus transfer
of ₹87,416 crore that was given to the Centre last year.
""Totalling up all the operating expenses and subtracting them from total income, we arrive at a surplus (before provisions) of ₹3.4 trillion (₹3.4 lakh crore). Once we account for provisions of ₹2.2 trillion, that leaves us with a dividend of ₹1.2 trillion,"" A Prasanna, head of research at
ICICI Securities Primary Dealership
, recently wrote in a note to clients. ""Such a large dividend is likely to be paired with the maximum permissible rise in (the central bank's) core capital ratio as well, thereby strengthening RBI's balance sheet for a rainy day.""
Among the key factors that could contribute to a large surplus transfer is a sharp increase in interest that the RBI would have earned through its foreign exchange assets, amid aggressive rate increases by the US Federal Reserve over the last couple of years.
Further, while the RBI's gross sales and purchases of US dollars were lower in FY24 than FY23 - a year when the central bank intervened heavily in markets to shield the rupee from excessive volatility - analysts still expect a hefty boost to the central bank's earnings from foreign assets.

Need proactive risk mitigation measures to tackle cyberattacks: RBI DG,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/need-proactive-risk-mitigation-measures-to-tackle-cyberattacks-rbi-dg/articleshow/110215333.cms,17-05-2024,"RBI
deputy governor Swaminathan J said the potential impact of a cyberattack on a bank's operations, reputation, and
financial stability
cannot be ""overstated"", as he emphasised the need for
proactive risk mitigation strategies
. Speaking at the Conference of Heads of Assurance of
Urban Cooperative Banks
here on Thursday, the deputy governor said that in the ever-changing landscape of banking, new risks constantly emerge. While traditional risks like credit, market and liquidity risks remain significant, new challenges like
cybersecurity threats
and operational disruptions have emerged.
The proliferation of
digital technologies
and the interconnected nature of financial systems have exposed banks to a myriad of cyber threats, ranging from data breaches to malicious ransomware attacks, he added.
""The potential impact of a successful cyberattack on a bank's operations, reputation, and financial stability cannot be overstated, underscoring the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures and proactive risk mitigation strategies,"" the deputy governor added.
He further said the focus of regulation and supervision is shifting towards activity-based. Similar activities, having similar risks, need to have the same level of regulatory and supervisory oversight, albeit with an element of proportionality to factor in the scale and complexity of operations.
""Therefore, regulations for cooperative banks are becoming harmonised with that for commercial banks, but with certain calibrations wherever required,"" he noted.
Live Events
The expectations from
Urban Cooperative Banks
(UCBs), especially for corporate governance and the effectiveness of assurance functions, are much higher now.
""As some of our recent enforcement actions would have demonstrated, there is now zero tolerance for poor corporate governance practices such as loans to directors or their relatives,"" Swaminathan said.
The deputy governor added that assurance functions namely the risk management, internal audit and compliance functions play very crucial roles, as guardians ensuring the bank operates safely, ethically and within regulatory and legal boundaries.
Assurance functionaries by becoming effective gatekeepers can give the required comfort to all stakeholders that the bank is on the right track, its systems are strong, operations are reliable, and risks are managed effectively, he said.
""As conscience keepers of the bank, they are intended to detect and prevent any deviations or build-up of any potential risks, safeguard the reputation of the bank and help uphold the trust of its customers and other stakeholders,"" the RBI Deputy Governor said.
He also emphasised that one of the most important facets of effective assurance functions is independence.
There are regulations already in place that provide for adequate stature, direct lines of reporting and preventing dual hatting of assurance functionaries, Swaminathan said.

estimates in the full budget.
Officials

collections
at ₹38.30 lakh crore, a growth of 11.45% over the revised estimates for FY 2023-24.

RBI's investment in IIFC UK subsidiary fell by a fifth in FY23-24,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-investment-in-iifc-uk-subsidiary-fell-by-a-fifth-in-fy23-24/articleshow/110091148.cms,13-05-2024,"The
RBI
's
investment
in the state-owned
India Infrastructure Finance Company
(
IIFC
)
UK subsidiary
fell by a fifth from a year earlier to $932 million in FY’2023-24, according to the latest Half Yearly Report on Management of Foreign Exchange Reserve released on Monday.
The central bank is mandated to invest small portion of its foreign exchange reserves- $ 5 billion in the company following demands from the government in the past to fund infrastructure.
The
Budget 2007-08
had announced that, with a view to further supplementing financial resources for
infrastructure development
in India, an
off-shore wholly owned subsidiary
of
IIFCL
would be set up.
The
subsidiary
company would borrow funds from the RBI and lend to Indian companies implementing
infrastructure
projects in India, or to co-finance their External Commercial Borrowings for such projects, solely for capital expenditure outside India. RBI’s investment in the company is through subscription of bonds issued by the company.
Though the proposal was not initially acceptable to the central bank then, it was subsequently decided to carve out $5 billion of the reserves to invest in the
UK
subsidiary of IIFC.
Live Events
The report also highlighted that during the half-year period under review, reserves increased from $ 587.71billion as at end-September 2023 to $ 646.42 billion as at end-March 2024.
On a balance of payments basis (i.e., excluding valuation effects),
foreign exchange reserves
increased by $ 32.9 billion during April-December 2023 compared to the reduction of $ 14.7 billion during April-December 2022. Foreign exchange reserves in nominal terms (including valuation effects) increased by $ 44 billion during April-December 2023 as against a decrease of $ 44.6 billion in the corresponding period of the preceding year.
Although both US dollar and Euro are intervention currencies and the Foreign Currency Assets (FCA) are maintained in major currencies, the foreign exchange reserves are denominated and expressed in US dollar terms.
Movements in the FCA occur mainly on account of purchase and sale of foreign exchange by the RBI, income arising out of the deployment of the foreign exchange reserves, external aid receipts of the Central Government and changes on account of revaluation of the assets.

Since the bank is comfortably placed with respect to capital with capital adequacy ratio of 21.2 percent,
Exim
may not need any capital support from the government.
The bank’s loan portfolio grew by 17% in FY2023-24, driven by strong growth in sectors such as clean and renewable energy, automotive, engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications.
Exim is looking at 10 to 12 percent growth in its business is FY’2024-25, but a lot would depend on the external environment Ms Banagari said.

India to extend budgetary support of $50 million to Maldives,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-to-extend-budgetary-support-of-50-million-to-maldives/articleshow/110085310.cms,14-05-2024,"India on Monday decided to continue its
budgetary support
to the
Maldives
government with the
rollover
of a $50 million
treasury bill
for another year. This follows the
Maldivian
government's special request made during
Foreign Minister
Moosa Zameer's visit here last week.
The State Bank of India has subscribed for one more year to the $50 million Government Treasury Bill, issued by the Ministry of Finance of Maldives, upon maturity of the previous subscription, the High Commission of India in Male said in a statement.
These treasury bills are subscribed by
SBI
under government-to-government, a unique arrangement at zero cost (interest-free) to the Government of Maldives.
The continuation of subscription has been made at the special request of the Government of Maldives to secure budgetary support from India, the statement said. The Maldivian government thanked India for its support. ""I thank EAM @DrSJaishankar and the Government of #India for extending vital budgetary support to the Maldives with the rollover of
USD 50 million
Treasury Bill. This is a true gesture of goodwill which signifies the longstanding friendship between #Maldives and #India,"" Zameer wrote on X.
""Government of India's decision to rollover the T-Bill came following a request to that effect made by Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer to India's External Affairs Minister Dr
S Jaishankar
, during the official bilateral visit to India from May 8-10,"" according to a Maldivian
Foreign Ministry
. The statement said a large number of infrastructure and high-impact community developmental projects are underway with assistance from India, which consists of a notable part as grant assistance.Zameer and Jaishankar had discussed the means to expedite the projects currently being built on soft loans and grants provided by India to the Maldives.
Live Events
Several infrastructure and connectivity projects have been built and are being built in the Maldives under the Exim Bank of India line of credit of $800 million. Some key projects will be inaugurated over the next few months. In August 2022, India announced a financial assistance of more than $250 million for the Maldives, one of the main beneficiaries of the Modi government's 'Neighbourhood First' policy.
The two sides had signed six agreements at the time, including one on cybersecurity and another on creating a network of police facilities in the archipelago, as the then visiting Maldivian President, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, held talks with PM Narendra Modi, officials said. In November 2022, India provided additional financial assistance of $100 million to the Maldives, they said. In 2018, India had given a financial assistance package of $1.4 billion to the Maldives. This included $50 million as budgetary support, subscription by the SBI to the Maldives treasury bills of $150 million, currency swap agreement for $400 million, and eight infrastructure projects under the $800 million line of credit.
Five of the eight projects are under implementation--water and sanitation on 34 islands, Addu Development Project (roads and land reclamation), Hanimaadhoo International Airport redevelopment project, expansion of Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company facilities in Felivaru and Gemanafushi, and Gan International Airport redevelopment project.

RBI likely to transfer Rs 1 lakh crore to govt in FY25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-likely-to-transfer-rs-1-trillion-to-govt-in-fy25/articleshow/110012330.cms,10-05-2024,"The
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) is likely to transfer approximately Rs 1 lakh crore to the
government
IN
FY25
according to a report by
Union Bank of India
.
The report said that RBI is anticipated to maintain a robust
dividend
payout for the
fiscal year
2025 (FY25). This projection represents a slight increase from Rs 874 billion transferred in the previous fiscal year.
""The government has budgeted the FY25 dividend for RBI and PSU banks & financial institutions at Rs 1020bn, vis-a-vis Rs 1044 bn in FY24. In our view, a positive surprise is likely, similar to last year when initial budget estimate for overall dividend was only Rs 480 bn"" said the report.
Analysts in the report predict a potential positive surprise, akin to the previous fiscal year, when the initial budget estimate for dividends was significantly lower at Rs 480 billion. Despite several factors influencing RBI's dividend calculation, such as
interest earnings
and
foreign exchange
(FX) gains, analysts predict a continuation of strong dividend figures.
About 70% of the Reserve Bank of India's
balance sheet
is comprised of foreign currency assets, while around 20% is held in domestic government bonds. It is anticipated that interest income generated from these securities will fall within the range of Rs 1.5-1.7 trillion.

Additionally, interest from liquidity operations has increased RBI's earnings, particularly as the banking system returned to a deficit mode from September 2023.
While income gains of RBI from FX (
Forex
) sales decreased slightly due to lower sales volumes, they are expected to remain substantial despite a rise in the weighted average cost of
reserves
.
Moreover, a decline in
provisions
likely contributed to boosting RBI's dividend. Provisions for reserves, as per the Economic Capital Framework outlined by the Jalan committee, saw a rise in the contingency fund provision due to increased balance sheet growth.
The impact of the RBI dividend announcement on markets may be limited in the near term, especially with ongoing elections potentially delaying government spending.
However, if the surplus balance is utilized for activities like G-Sec buybacks, it could support the shorter end of the G-Sec curve. Overall, analysts maintain a positive outlook on longer-duration G-Secs due to favorable demand-supply dynamics.

India's transaction trends: ePayment riches leave circulation of currency poorer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-transaction-trends-epayment-riches-leave-circulation-of-currency-poorer/articleshow/109958715.cms,09-05-2024,"India’s leap to
digital payments
is structurally tamping down on traditional
currency leakage
from its banking system, with growth of
currency in circulation
(CIC) in FY24 declining the most since demonetisation. The Reserve Bank of India’s (
RBI
) withdrawal of Rs 2,000 banknotes from circulation last year also contributed, triggering a flood of currency deposits close to the recall deadline and lowering growth in CIC by `1 lakh crore. The
demonetisation
in FY17 sought to replace more than four-fifths of notes by value.
“Over the last few years, a steady reduction in currency leakage is being seen with the rise of
electronic payments
, especially the Unified Payments Interface (
UPI
),” said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist at
IDFC First Bank
.
“In FY24, currency in circulation was higher by Rs 1.4 lakh crore, which is significantly lower than Rs 2.4 lakh crore in FY23, due to the rise of UPI payments and the
Rs 2,000 note withdrawal
,” said Sengupta of
IDFC First Bank
.
CIC Growth Slowing Steadily
Central bank data showed CIC growth has fallen steadily over the past three years, while the volume of transactions using UPI and other digital platforms — such as the
National Electronic Fund Transfer
(NEFT) — has soared. In April this year,
UPI transaction
values were at `19.6 lakh crore, nearly 40% higher than `14.1 lakh crore the same time a year ago, data published by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) showed. Meanwhile, NEFT, which is run by RBI, has registered growth of 700% in volume terms and 670% in value terms from 2014 to 2023, the central bank said. On February 29,
NEFT
processed 41 million transactions in a single day, a record high, RBI said earlier.
Live Events
This year, while currency leakage began to pick up in January, February, and March — ahead of the Lok Sabha elections — the numbers have trended lower in April, RBI data showed. In the first month of the current financial year, the increase in currency in circulation was at `50,800 crore, down from `59,400 crore a month ago and sharply lower than `76,800 crore a year ago.
STRUCTURAL SHIFT
“The usage of electronic systems over a longer period of time should help lower the usage of hard cash. This is a more structural story, which will have an impact over multiple years,” said Namrata Mittal, chief economist at
SBI Mutual Fund
. “There has been lower CIC withdrawal in FY24. A part of it could also be because of the fact that right after Covid, CIC withdrawals were slightly above trend. I would still attribute it in a large portion to the discontinuation of `2,000 notes,” she said.

global concern
surrounding
environmental issues
and
clean energy
pose certain threats to
Indian companies
planning to invest abroad, consultancy major
EY
said in a report. While deeper insights are needed in areas like Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (
CBAM
),
transfer pricing
regime,
permanent establishment rules
, it said that higher
investment
limits for strategic
PSUs
investing overseas and investment by
family offices
are expected to spur overseas investments.
India’s outward
foreign investment
increased to $22.88 billion in FY23 from $1 billion in FY02.
On CBAM, it said: “Effective October 2023, it will be an additional cost for importers of specific emission-intensive product categories into the
EU
and means new compliance and reporting obligations. Companies therefore need to proactively address CBAM-related challenges for exporting ‘covered products’ to their overseas subsidiaries by understanding the requirements, assessing the potential impact on their operations and by developing a compliance plan”.
Referring to India’s new-age free trade agreements (FTA), it said that Indian
MNCs
would need to undertake comprehensive market analysis to identify new avenues for growth and understand tariff reductions, market access, regulatory changes and overall compliance environment to seize emerging opportunities and competitiveness in the post
FTA
regime.
“As companies navigate this expansion, they must astutely manage the local environment and manage emerging challenges like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to maintain competitive exports. Additionally, a robust financing strategy and meticulous post-acquisition integration are crucial for successful global acquisitions,” said Ajit Krishnan, Tax Partner, EY India.
Live Events
Another emerging issue in recent years, under consideration of foreign multinationals in oil and gas sector, is the structuring of investments in developing nations through a jurisdiction that has a ‘Bilateral Investment Treaty’(
BIT
), with the operating (local) jurisdiction.
“This could mitigate risk of dilution of interest in the event the local government seeks to nationalize or take any other regulatory step which impacts the Indian MNC’s value in the overseas asset,” it said.
As countries implement the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar 2 rules, there could be variations and inconsistencies, adding complexities to cross-border investments and
tax planning
.
“While the rules aim to prevent tax evasion, they may also lead to potential double taxation scenarios if not applied uniformly across countries,” EY said.
Place of Effective Management (POEM), investment regime and incentives in the foreign country and differences in intellectual property laws and enforcement mechanisms may impact the protection of patents and proprietary technologies, posing risks to investment returns, according to the report.
“Further, in some regions, local manufacturing requirements or import restrictions may require a specific strategy for supply chain management for operations,” EY said.
As per the report titled ‘India abroad: navigating the global landscape of overseas investment’, energy security, technological collaborations and access to new markets are among the key factors for overseas investment.

Six-week long election leaves RBI with liquidity dilemma,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-6-week-long-election-leaves-rbi-with-liquidity-dilemma/articleshow/109877144.cms,06-05-2024,"RBI
is stepping in to ease
banking system
liquidity conditions as a national
election
which stretches over six weeks is hurting government
spending
despite strong tax collections.
Voting in national elections began on April 19 and will conclude on June 1, with counting on June 4. Typically,
government
spending slows during polls and picks up only after a new government is in place and a budget is presented.
On Friday, the government announced a surprise
buyback
of
bonds
worth Rs 40,000 crore ($4.8 billion), which will infuse funds into the banking system. Yields on bonds maturing in 2-5 years fell 3-5 basis points on Monday. Longer-term yields also cooled.
The buyback of securities is a
liquidity
injecting tool, and will help in easing liquidity in the system, a source familiar with the government's thinking said.
India
's average banking system liquidity has been in deficit since April 20 and is expected stay in deficit or close to neutral this month, according to economists.
Live Events
""The buyback announcement could be an exercise to infuse liquidity because we have an interim budget and the
general election
, so the government expenditure is lesser than usual,"" Gaura Sen Gupta, India economist at
IDFC FIRST Bank
said.
In April-June 2023, government spending was Rs 2.78 lakh crore, and stood at Rs 1.75 lakh crore in the same period a year before, according to Anitha Rangan, an economist at
Equirus Group
.
""This year, April-June spending would be significantly lower than that due to elections,"" she said.
India's
central bank
has also stepped up short-term liquidity infusions.
Since mid-April, the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has infused Rs 1.7 lakh crore via variable rate repo auctions,
Citi
economists said in a note on Monday.
""The RBI might be anticipating that the election-related delayed decision-making in the government might constrain spending and in turn cause further liquidity tightness,"" they said.
The central bank's dividend is likely to be transferred to the government in May but spending may be delayed due to the elections, Citi said.

ET explainer: Why RBI's dividend payout to govt this year will be lower,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/et-explainer-why-rbis-dividend-payout-to-govt-this-year-will-be-lower/articleshow/109858899.cms,05-05-2024,"The
Reserve Bank
may transfer a lesser dividend to the government for FY'2023-24 compared to previous year's bumper Rs 87416 crore. An explainer on why the dividend will be lower. The budget estimates dividend transfer in FY'2024-25 at Rs 1.02 lakh crore from the Financial sector entities including the Reserve Bank and public sector banks. But a bulk of the dividend flows is from the central bank.
What is the Reserve Bank's dividend distribution policy?
The Reserve Bank follows the recommendations of the report by a committee headed by former
RBI
governor Bimal Jalan which has recommended that provisioning in the form of Contingent Risk Buffer (CRB) has to be maintained within a range of 6.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent of the RBI’s balance sheet, comprising 5.5 to 4.5 per cent for monetary and financial stability risks and 1.0 per cent for credit and operational risks. This risk provisioning is made primarily from retained earnings and only then the surplus income is transferred to the government as dividend.
What are the estimates for the central bank's transfer to the government ?
RBI dividend
is expected to Rs 75000 crore to RS 85000 crore this year depending on the provisioning compared to Rs 87416 crore according to estimates by IDFC First Bank. Income is expected to be supported from interest income on foreign securities and rupee securities. Earnings on foreign exchange transactions, which accounts for more than half of the central bank's income, are expected to be lower with gross dollar sales at $151.4 billion in April-February 2023-34 compared to $206.4billion in the same period a year ago.
Why will the government transfer less?
For one the central bank sold fewer dollars than the previous year which brings down the commission income on forex sales. Also its balance sheet grew faster 11.4 percent in FY'24 from Rs 63.4 lakh crore in March 2023 to Rs 70.7 lakh crore in March 2924 compared to 2.5 percent growth in FY'23, which raises the absolute levels of economic capital that the central bank needs to set aside, which in turn brings down the surplus.
What is going to support RBI's income?
Interest income from foreign securities is likely to rise with expansion of holdings of foreign currency assets. Also income from liquidity adjustment facility or LAF operations could be higher as system level liquidity was in deficit on an overall basis as the during the year was higher. Loans to commercial banks were more than double the last year's levels at Rs 1.53 lakh crore.

What are the implications of the
dividend payout
?
The dividend payment (in mid-May) will support government surplus and there-in support government expenditure and liquidity in May 2024, according to IDFC First Bank.
What is the outlook for FY' 2024-25?
A lot would depend on forex inflows, level of the rupee versus dollar and the system level liquidity. Banking system liquidity is expected to improve in the second half of the fiscal supported by higher capital inflows. Around 60% of the bond index inflows are expected to come in the second half , supporting FPI inflows into debt, according to IDFC First Bank. Other capital inflows are expected to pick-up in the second half as the Fed starts easing rates.

A senior bank executive said that one of the major focus areas of
PSBs
in FY25 will be developing capabilities for raising green funds and increasing their green lending portfolios. ""Banks will set up specialised cells that will also focus on physical and transition risk in the existing loan portfolio and new loan opportunities,"" he said, adding that other responsibilities include assessment of the environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related risks of borrowers through data.
According to a report by the Reserve Bank of India, the country's
green financing
requirement is estimated to be at least 2.5% of GDP annually until 2030. Earlier this year, the banking regulator came out with draft guidelines on the disclosure framework for climate-related financial risks in 2024. The draft also proposes a glide path for detailed disclosures by regulated entities (REs) in the areas of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.
Bankers have been making demands for more incentives in order to promote green financing, including deposits. Earlier this year, State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara had said that they have approached the RBI seeking relaxation in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement for green deposits. ""We have put across the ask. One, of course, is a reduction in CRR for green deposits, and second, if at all as a policy, it can be incorporated into the regulatory policy mechanism,"" he had said.

's leading cash logistics company,
CMS Infosystems
, revealed a notable 5.51% growth in the monthly average
cash withdrawals
from ATMs, reaching Rs 1.43 crore in FY24. Despite the increasing popularity of digital payment modes like
UPI
, which has led to speculation about a decline in cash usage, the report indicates a steady demand for cash across the country.
The report highlights that the average cash withdrawn saw a significant 10.37% increase in metro areas, followed by a 3.94% increase in semi-urban and rural areas (SURU), and a 3.73% increase in semi-metros. This growth underscores the continued reliance on cash transactions in various parts of the country.
According to the report,
ATM
cash withdrawals in metro locations have surged by 37.49%, while SURU witnessed a growth of 12.50% in ATM cash withdrawals, reflecting the varying cash usage patterns across different regions.
The distribution of ATMs across different areas also varied between state-run and
private sector lenders
. Approximately 49% of ATMs of
state-run lenders
are located in metropolitan and urban areas, whereas the figure stands at 64% for private sector lenders. The remaining ATMs are situated in semi-urban and rural areas for both categories of lenders.
Karnataka
emerged as the state with the highest absolute withdrawals per ATM, with an annual average withdrawal of Rs 1.83 crore, followed closely by Delhi at Rs 1.82 crore and West Bengal at Rs 1.62 crore, indicating strong cash demand in these regions.

Cash in circulation more than doubles since FY17 on consumption demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cash-is-king-along-with-upi/articleshow/109670328.cms,29-04-2024,"Despite phasing out Rs 2000 notes,
cash
in circulation has more than doubled since FY'2016-17, the year of
demonetisation
and launch of
UPI
. Tracking
HSBC PMI
and
CMS cash index
shows that they have moved in tandem indicating that cash is also as important as digital modes of transactions.
The
currency in circulation
has more than doubled from Rs 13.35 lakh crore in March 2017 to Rs 35.15 lakh crore in end March 2024. Significantly the currency in circulation has happened despite the central bank deciding to withdraw the Rs 2000 denomination banknotes from circulation from May 2023 which resulted in the central bank getting 97.83 percent of Rs 3.56 lakh crore worth notes back to the banking system.
While
digital payments
through UPI was launched in 2016, it gained scale only after COVID-19 in 2020 and has gone up almost nine times. The value of monthly UPI transactions has gone up from Rs 2.06 lakh crore in March 2020 to a record Rs 18.07 lakh crore in February 2024.
The Reserve Bank's assessments on currency in circulation shows that currency demand often tends to be higher during festivals and prior to big elections or in a year in which the agricultural sector clocks a strong growth as it props cash demand from rural areas.
Live Events
Underscoring the importance of cash in the system the CMS Info System's (which offers cash management and other business services) CMS cash index has trended in with HSBC Purchase Manager's Index since the CMS index was launched in 2017. While the CMS cash index has gone up from 100 in April 2017 to 125.6 in March 2024, the HSBC PMI went up from 100 to 117 in the same period. Th
The trend indicated a strong core;ation between the level of economic activity and cash spends. “For an
economy
to flourish, it is imperative that the payments ecosystem allows all modes of transaction. Cash payments are an indispensable complement to mobile, electronic, and other forms of digital payments"" said Anush Raghavan, President, Cash Management Solutions,
CMS Info Systems
. ""This balance is especially vital for a consumption-driven economy like India, where the ability to spend influences overall economic health.”
Smaller economies like Brazil, South Africa, Russia, and the UK had much lower volumes of CiC, when compared to the larger economies like the US, China, Japan, and India indicating the direct correlation between CIC and the size of the economy. Raghavan said.
The CMS Cash Index is a weighted index consisting of two factors namely the cash that goes into circulation via the ATM channels as replenishment and the cash collected from the organised retail channels post-consumer purchases. Both are covered by CMS Info Systems across cities and towns in India.
CMS Info Systems' Consumption Report 2024 titled ‘Unfolding India’s Consumption Story 2024’ showed that spends are increasing in consumer durables and FMCG sector and also for travel and entertainment and topped growth in FY'24. Delhi, Tamil Nadu,
Uttar Pradesh
, West Bengal, and Karnataka lead with the highest growth in ATM withdrawals for spends in FY24.

"Mop up from divestment, asset sale beats FY24 RE of Rs 30,000 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/mop-up-from-divestment-asset-sale-beats-fy24-re-of-rs-30000-crore/articleshow/109602779.cms,26-04-2024,"The
government
's ""miscellaneous capital receipts"", which include realisation from disinvestment and
asset monetisation
, exceeded the revised estimate of Rs 30,000 crore in
fiscal 2024
, a senior official said.
While disinvestment proceeds totalled Rs 16,507 crore, asset monetisation fetched around Rs 16,000 crore, he told ET. ""Some road assets were monetised on a ToT (toll, operate and transfer) basis,"" he added.
In a rare move, the interim budget for FY25 clubbed the government's disinvestment and asset monetisation targets under the ""miscellaneous capital receipts"" head, instead of declaring them separately. The budget, presented on February 1, had pegged the combined realisation for FY24 at Rs 30,000 crore (revised estimate) and Rs 50,000 crore for FY25.
The government had initially budgeted a disinvestment target of Rs 51,000 crore for the last fiscal year ended on March 31. But it had to tamp down its disinvestment ambition, as the
IDBI Bank
sell-off process spilled over to FY25.
Meanwhile, dividend collections by the government from non-financial central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and entities in which it holds a minority stake rose to a new peak of Rs 63,749 crore in 2023-24, according to data from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (
DIPAM
). The dividend revenue - about 27.5% higher from the revised estimate of 50,000 crore - beat the previous best of Rs 59,533 crore recorded in 2022-23, reflecting strong performance by state-run firms across sectors.
Live Events
Higher-than-estimated revenue mop-up through miscellaneous capital receipts and CPSE dividends are expected to have helped the government meet its revised FY24 fiscal deficit target of 5.8% of GDP, or even better it if other projections also held true. Details of the government's FY24 fiscal deficit data will be released next month.
DIPAM secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had earlier told ET that setting a high annual disinvestment target would potentially create an ""overhang in the market"" and could be detrimental to the value creation strategy of the CPSEs concerned. So, the government would follow a ""calibrated disinvestment strategy"", he said, adding that any
asset sale
or monetisation road map must be subservient to the value creation strategy.
Improved performances of CPSEs not just help enhance their market value, but also boost the government's dividend prospects, Pandey had said.

"India growth story to benefit Japan's firms, says Nomura",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-growth-story-to-benefit-japans-firms-says-nomura/articleshow/109567756.cms,25-04-2024,"Mumbai:
Japan
, Asia’s second-biggest economy long hobbled by a shrinking home consumer base, is increasingly looking toward
India
for viable
investment
choices – both in physical and financial assets – as the world’s fastest-expanding country seeks to consolidate its lead at the top of the growth ladder, showed a
Nomura
report.
Foreign direct investment (
FDI
) from Japan in India has been rising, and Japanese investments in foreign equities (as of end-2022) showed India at the top of the list for developing countries, underscoring Mumbai’s increasing importance to investors in Tokyo seeking durable returns on investments.
Japanese individual investors are also investing more aggressively in Indian stocks by way of investment trusts, with India now at the top of the list among emerging market economies, the report said. China, a traditional beneficiary of Japanese investments over the years, has slid in the preference rankings.
“In the ranking of countries seen as promising for the medium term in the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)'s FY23 Survey on Overseas Business Operations by Japanese Manufacturing Companies, India took the top spot for a second consecutive year, even as China fell to number three,” said the Nomura report, a collaborative effort by Indian and Japanese economists and
equity
strategists.
Manufacturing sectors have been the main driver of Japanese direct investment in India to date, with transport equipment accounting for 35.1% of direct investment in the country, machinery equipment for 10.5%, and chemicals and pharmaceutical for 6.5% as of end-2022.

"FDI reform 2.0: Banking, defence, insurance reforms on table",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/fdi-reform-2-0-banking-defence-insurance-reforms-on-table/articleshow/109481950.cms,22-04-2024,"New Delhi: The government is examining if foreign direct investment norms (
FDI
) for banking, insurance and defence can be further liberalised, after rules were relaxed for the space and satellite sectors recently.
Officials said that although the bulk of the heavy lifting in terms of FDI reforms has been completed, talks are ongoing to see if conditions for these key sectors can be further eased. Any changes will be made after the elections that end on June 1.
“Some areas in finance and insurance, (and) even in defence, could still be looked at in terms of further reduction. Brainstorming is going on, but it has not reached anywhere,” said an official aware of deliberations. A final call will be taken after consultations among officials and with stakeholders.
FDI equity inflows fell 13% year-on-year to $32.03 billion during April-December 2023.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) has attributed the FDI slump in developing nations to weak investment and economic uncertainty.
Live Events
FDI in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), outsourcing as well as R&D — the group that attracted the highest inflows — was at $5.18 billion in April-December 2023.
The Centre’s view is that India should relax FDI rules further, though its current policy is more liberal than that of some other nations, officials said.
“We are more liberal than most of the Asean countries, which are generally considered very open,” the official said.
India allows 74% FDI in private sector banking. Up to 49% is permitted through the automatic route; government approval is needed beyond that. In public sector banking, the FDI cap is fixed at 20% through the government route.
India permits 49% FDI in insurance companies through the automatic route and 100% in insurance intermediaries, subject to conditions.
The defence industry is subject to industrial licence under the Industries (Development & Regulation) Act. FDI can go up to 100% in manufacture of small arms and ammunition under the Arms Act, of which up to 74% is permitted through the automatic route, subject to conditions.
Between April 2000 and December 2023, FDI equity inflows in defence amounted to $16.38 million.

She stated, ""When big companies show interest in coming to India, we will do everything to make it attractive for them to come and invest. In that process, if there is anything to discuss, we will certainly discuss. But whatever we have done, we have done it through policy.""
Sitharaman highlighted the success of the government's approach, especially after concerns arose about China plus one strategy among industry experts. She emphasized that policies have been tailored to make India an attractive destination for both manufacturing and services.

Regarding inflation, Sitharaman noted that except for one month, inflation has not crossed the tolerance band under the Narendra Modi government. She contrasted this with the pre-2014 period when the economy was struggling, and inflation was in double digits.
She stated, ""At that time, nobody had any expectations from the country. After much hard work, we have emerged as the world's fifth-largest economy and are confidently saying we will be third in the next two to two-and-a-half years.""
On the topic of
employment
, Sitharaman acknowledged the lack of complete data from both formal and informal sectors but highlighted the government's initiatives that have provided jobs to lakhs of people.
She mentioned, ""All I can say regarding employment is that the money given to people and startups through different schemes...people in crores have availed support. Between October 2022 and November 2023, through the Rozgar Mela, Modi has given government jobs to 10 lakh people.""
""The data is inadequate. I am not saying this pride but while accepting its weakness. All I can say regarding employment is that the money given to people and startups through different schemes...people in crores have availed support. Between October 2022 and November 2023, through the Rozgar Mela, Modi has given government jobs to 10 lakh people,"" she said. When asked about the rule that requires larger companies to pay Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (
MSMEs
) within 45 days of receiving goods or services, Sitharaman said the law has been existence since 2007-08 and is not new.
Sitharaman also addressed the rule that requires larger companies to pay Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) within 45 days of receiving goods or services. She clarified that this law has been in existence since 2007-08 and is not new.
She further explained, ""Later MSMEs themselves came and said the 45-day payment is not happening within that financial year. But within that financial year, this amount is shown as expenditure and to that extent tax is not being paid. All that we have done through the Finance Act that was passed in Parliament on February 1, 2023.""
""We just said tax treatment remains the same. Make a claim in the year you pay to the MSMEs. How can you claim when you have not made payment?"" she asked.
Responding to queries about the Indian rupee weakening against the US dollar, Sitharaman attributed the fluctuation to global uncertainty, wars, and uncertainty in the supply of crude oil from the Middle East.
Earlier, speaking to industry leaders from Gujarat on 'Viksit Bharat -2047', Sitharaman praised the state's remarkable progress in attracting capital under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. She highlighted Gujarat's readiness for semiconductor manufacturing, stating, ""So semiconductor manufacturing for India comes first in Gujarat, which has a policy as well as government and ecosystem ready for manufacturing for Viksit Bharat 2047.""
""The IFSC at GIFT City in Gandhinagar is a big gateway for services to grow in Gujarat. A world-class financial services centre very close to Ahmedabad is just the key for India to reach that kind of global market for attracting more investment and more financial operations,"" Sitharaman said. She also said Gujarat was in third position in attracting FDI in manufacturing.
Sitharaman also praised the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City in Gandhinagar, calling it a gateway for services to grow in Gujarat and a key for India to reach the global market for attracting more investment and financial operations. She noted that Gujarat ranks third in attracting FDI in manufacturing.

"Investment proposals from border nations: 201 denied, 124 approved",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/investment-proposals-from-border-nations-201-denied-124-approved/articleshow/109443275.cms,19-04-2024,"New Delhi: India has approved 124
investment proposals
from bordering countries and rejected 201 in the past four years since the government amended the norms for such investors, officials said.
In April 2020, India made prior government approval mandatory for FDI from bordering countries, irrespective of sectoral caps, by amending Press Note 3 (PN3) to curb opportunistic takeovers of Indian companies. As per the amendment, ""an entity of a country, sharing land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an
investment
into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the government route"".
""On PN3, 526 proposals came in. Of these, 124 were approved, 201 rejected and the rest, which is another 200, are pending 2020 onwards,"" said an official, who did not wish to be identified. While the majority of the proposals were from China, a couple from Bangladesh and Nepal also came in. Investment proposals from these countries are subject to a scrutiny mechanism which is handled by the ministries of home affairs and external affairs, In case of adverse reports about any of the promoters in terms of links to the Chinese Communist Party or the People's Liberation Army, the proposed investments get held up.
""Some discussions are underway about whether this can be further nuanced but they have not reached any conclusion,"" the official added. At $2.5 billion, China's share in India's FDI equity inflows was 0.38% from April 2000-December 2023. Its position in FDI inflows to India dropped two notches to 22 from 20 in the April 2000-December 2021 period. ""While such proposals don't have a big influence on FDI and that is not even 1% of our FDI, there may be dampening effects in general. We should be able to ensure that the ones which are investing in our manufacturing should be allowed,"" the official said.

IMF applauds India for maintaining fiscal discipline in election year,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/imf-applauds-india-for-maintaining-fiscal-discipline-in-election-year/articleshow/109422878.cms,19-04-2024,"The
International Monetary Fund
has applauded
India
for maintaining
fiscal discipline
in an election year, saying that the Indian
economy
is doing well and continues to be the world's bright spot.
""At this point in time, India's economy is doing well. Growth at 6.8 per cent is very good. Inflation's coming down. We have to make sure that
inflation
comes down to target and it is there on a durable basis. Macro fundamentals look pretty good,"" Krishna
Srinivasan
, Director, Asia and Pacific Department, at the
IMF
told PTI in an interview.
""One thing I would say is that maintaining fiscal discipline, especially in the election year, for me, has been quite a highlight because countries do embark on fiscal adventures in the election year.
""This government has maintained a discipline, I think, is very important because at the end of the day, sound macro fundamentals are the basis on which countries prosper and have durable growth. So that's very important to maintain that,"" Srinivasan said.
India, he said, has successfully navigated multiple shocks over the last several years. It's emerging to be one of the fastest major economies in the world. ""In fact, for this year, for 2024-25, we project growth at 6.8 per cent led by
private consumption
and public investment. Inflation is coming down gradually. It's now below 5 per cent,"" he said.

""If you look at the macro fundamentals, they're pretty solid, despite this being an election year, the government has adhered to fiscal discipline. You look at the reserve position, it's strong. If you look at overall macro fundamentals, it's pretty good,"" he said, adding that risks to the economy are broadly balanced.
According to the Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
), India's forex reserves jumped by USD 2.98 billion to a fresh peak of USD 648.562 billion for the week ended April 5. In the previous reporting week, the forex kitty had increased by USD 2.951 billion to USD 645.583 billion, which was an all-time high.
""In the short-term, an important risk is volatile commodity prices with various tensions... But going beyond the short-term, you could think in terms of weather-related shocks, fragmentation, all these are things to worry about in terms of risks to the outlook.
""Of course, there are also risks to the upside when I say private consumption could be stronger. The impact from CapEx spending in India could be stronger with more crowding in the private investment. So those are upside risks. In a nutshell, India has a sweet spot at this point in time,"" the IMF official said.
Srinivasan said India is among the main drivers of global growth. ""This year we expect economic growth at 6.8 per cent. That is led by private consumption and a lot of public investment... India will contribute almost 17 per cent of global growth. So that's one reason why we think it's a bright spot,"" he said.
""The second driver is Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). I think this is an important moment, almost like a watershed moment. It's very fundamental because what the DPI does is it enhances productivity by fostering competition and innovation. It also furthers financial inclusion and makes the public sector that much more efficient. So this is a big thing,"" he said.
That's another reason why the IMF thinks India a bright spot.
""The third reason, is that India has a young and growing population. India is likely to add 15 million people to the labor force every year. There could be other factors which lead us to believe it's a bright spot. But again, when I talk about the young population and to benefit from the demographic dividend, I think a lot of reforms will be needed, which going forward over the medium-term will require a lot of reforms,"" he said.
For the demographic dividend to be reaped, India has to invest a lot in education and health. ""I cannot emphasize this more because it's not just about the population and how to employ them proactively. You're going to have transformations like AI coming into play.
""In India's labor force, the young have to be well skilled, well equipped to deal with these transformation changes to contribute effectively to the economy. In that sense, yes, investment in education, health is very important. That's one thing in terms of reforms,” he said.
""I would also say that making the labor market smoother, functioning well by implementing these labor reforms which have been passed recently is very important. Reducing the number of trade restrictions is important because this is, you give opportunities for people to expand the horizon beyond the domestic economy. Making the country more attractive to business investment is very important.
""Even now when you talk to investors, they talk about the red tape, the bureaucracy, how long it takes to get things done in India. I think those are things which need to be addressed effectively for India to gain from this young population and have long-term growth,” Srinivasan said.
""For the medium-term, we have a growth rate of 6.5 per cent, which is good. But you need more than that. And the last thing I would say is for investors to make well-informed decisions about the economy, about various issues, it'll be important to also at a fundamental level think in terms of our macroeconomic statistics, which can help people make well-informed decisions about investment, which is more durable,” said the IMF official.

Now beaming: Relaxed FDI cap for space inc,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/now-beaming-relaxed-fdi-cap-for-space-inc/articleshow/109382321.cms,18-04-2024,"The finance ministry has notified enhanced foreign direct investment (FDI) limits for satellite-related activities under the
Foreign Exchange Management
(Non-Debt Instruments) Rules. The new rules, based on the
Cabinet
decision in February on the relaxed
FDI
caps, came into effect from April 16, according to a gazette notification by the ministry.
The rules, coming just days ahead of Tesla chief
Elon Musk
's
India
visit, are aimed at drawing a larger number of foreign investors into the Indian space sector. Musk is reportedly planning to announce investments of $2-3 billion, mainly in the EV segment, and meet Indian space players as well during his India visit starting April 21.
As per the new rules, up to 100% FDI is allowed in the space sector. However, up to 74% FDI is permitted under the automatic route in satellite manufacturing and operation, satellite data products and ground and user segment. Beyond 74%, FDI in these activities requires government approval.
Similarly, up to 49% FDI is allowed under the automatic route in the launch vehicles and associated systems or subsystems, and in the creation of spaceports for launching and receiving spacecraft. Beyond this limit, government approval is needed. Also, up to 100% FDI under the automatic route is allowed in the manufacturing of components and systems or sub-systems for satellites and the ground and user segments.
The latest notification said: ""the investee entity shall be subject to sectoral guidelines as issued by the department of space"".

CBDT signs record number of 125 Advance Pricing Agreements in FY24,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cbdt-signs-record-number-of-125-advance-pricing-agreements-in-fy24/articleshow/109353918.cms,16-04-2024,"The Central Board of Direct Taxes (
CBDT
) has entered into a record 125
Advance Pricing Agreements
(APAs) with
Indian taxpayers
in 2023-24. This includes 86
Unilateral APAs
(UAPAs) and 39
Bilateral APAs
(BAPAs), the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
This marks the highest ever APA signings in any financial year since the launch of the APA programme, it said.
The number of APAs signed in 2023-24 also represents a 31 per cent increase compared to the 95 APAs signed during the preceding financial year.
With this, the total number of APAs since inception of the APA programme has gone up to 641, comprising 506 UAPAs and 135 BAPAs, it said.
During 2023-24 CBDT also signed the maximum number of BAPAs in any financial year till date, it said, adding, the BAPAs were signed as a consequence of entering into
mutual agreements
with India's treaty partners namely Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Singapore, the UK and the US.
Live Events
The APA Scheme endeavours to provide certainty to taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by specifying the methods of pricing and determining the arm's length price of international transactions in advance for a maximum of five future years.
Further, the taxpayer has the option to rollback the APA for four preceding years, as a result of which, tax certainty is provided for nine years.
The signing of bilateral APAs additionally provides the taxpayers with protection from any anticipated or actual
double taxation
.
The APA programme has contributed significantly to the government of India's mission of promoting ease of doing business, especially for multinational enterprises which have a large number of cross-border transactions within their group entities, it said.

RBI steps up gold buying amid US dollar volatility,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-steps-up-gold-buying-amid-us-dollar-volatility/articleshow/109294141.cms,15-04-2024,"The Reserve Bank of
India
(RBI) has stepped up gold purchases to help diversify its foreign exchange reserves base amid
US dollar
volatility. The rise in the value of outstanding gold reserves made up more than four-fifths of the near $3-billion increase in forex reserves at a record $ 648.5 billion as of April 5. In January-February this year the
RBI
bought 0.43 million troy ounce, or close to 13.3 tonnes of gold, from the market. That is over 80% of the total gold purchases of 0.52 million troy ounce in 2023 by the central bank.
""We are building up gold reserves, the data is released from time-to-time"" said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das at the post policy media conference on April 5. ""All aspects while building up the reserves are assessed and then we make a decision.""
The central bank's stated objective of holding gold in reserves is mainly to diversify its foreign currency assets base, as a hedge against inflation and foreign currency risks. The Reserve Bank of India has started to accumulate gold regularly from the market since December 2017. Its stock of gold as of end February, 2024 is 26.26 million troy ounce, up from $17.94 million troy ounce in December 2017.
Gold is seen as a stable asset at times of uncertainties and political turmoil. ""In my opinion the reason to buy gold is both political and economical,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist,
Bank of Baroda
. ""Dollar in general has been a very stable currency, but the dollar ceased to be reliable after the Ukraine war. Today, US bonds are at their highest yields. Dollar is not as strong a currency as it used to be, even though all trades happen in dollars.""
Live Events
Moreover, the over 7% appreciation in international gold prices since February has also helped in boosting the value of gold in reserves. The gold value in reserves which linked to the prices at the London Bullion exchange is revalued every week. The yellow metal prices are touching new highs and are trading at over $2300 a troy ounce (one troy ounce is about 31 gms).
Also, the faith in dollar assets by central banks appears to be diminishing. Non-US central banks' holding of US treasury bonds has fallen from 50.1% in January 2023 to 47.2% as of January 2024, according to the US treasury department data. ""It makes a lot of sense (to invest in gold), given the increased volatility in the FX market, elevated interest rates in the US, and, of course, also as the central banks in each economy would like to diversify the asset classes in which they are parking their reserves,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, head of South Asia Economic Research,
Standard Chartered Bank
."" For India, the total amount of gold reserves is bound to increase because the corpus of reserves has increased. Moreover, with gold appreciating, that's also giving a boost. Central banks don't usually go by just valuation though, there will be bigger factors in our view, which would be diversification of reserves.""
In value terms (USD), the share of gold in the total foreign exchange reserves increased from about 7.9% as of early April 2023 to about 8.41% as at early April 2024.
But the central bank holds only a portion of the reserves locally. According to the latest Report on Foreign Exchange reserves, of the total 800.79 metric tonnes of gold (including gold deposits of 39.89 metric tonnes) the Reserve Bank held 388.06 metric tonnes of gold overseas in custody with Bank of England and Bank of International Settlements (BIS), and 372.84 metric tonnes of gold is being held domestically, as of September 2023.

Amended India-Mauritius tax treaty will not be applied retrospectively: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/amended-india-mauritius-tax-treaty-will-not-be-applied-retrospectively-report/articleshow/109248124.cms,12-04-2024,"A revised tax treaty between India and Mauritius will come into effect only once the two countries sign the agreement and will not be applied retrospectively, news channel CNBC-TV18 reported on Friday, citing sources.
The new provisions in the treaty include a principle purpose test, which will be used to judge whether tax benefits under the treaty will apply to investments or not, according to the text of the treaty released by India's foreign ministry.
As per the amended treaty, tax benefits for investments will not be granted if it is ascertained that availing tax benefits was one of the reasons of the transaction.
India's finance ministry did not immediately respond to queries.
Investment into India by Foreign Portfolio Investors (
FPIs
) from Mauritius stood at Rs 4.19 lakh crore ($50.20 billion), about 6% of total the FPI investments as of March 2024, according to data from the National Securities Deposit

India benefiting from growing interest from multinationals: UN report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-benefiting-from-growing-interest-from-multinationals-un-report/articleshow/109200698.cms,10-04-2024,"India
is benefiting from growing interest from
multinationals
, which see it as an alternative manufacturing base in the context of developed economies' supply chain diversification strategies, a flagship report by the UN has said, underlining that investment in the country remains strong.
The '2024 Financing for Sustainable Development Report: Financing for Development at a Crossroads (
FSDR 2024
)' launched Tuesday said that urgent steps are needed to mobilise financing at scale to close the development financing gap, now estimated at 4.2 trillion dollars annually, up from 2.5 trillion dollars before the COVID-19 pandemic. underlining that investment in the country remains strong.
Meanwhile, rising geopolitical tensions, climate disasters and a global cost-of-living crisis have hit billions of people, battering progress on healthcare, education, and other development targets.
The report said that investment is expected to remain subdued globally.
""In contrast, investment in South Asia, particularly in India, remains strong. India is benefiting from growing interest from multinationals, which see the country as an alternative manufacturing base in the context of developed economies' supply chain diversification strategies,"" it said, in an apparent reference to China.

The report noted that prospects in most developing countries are also weak due to softer external demand, volatile commodity prices, high borrowing costs and fiscal consolidation pressures. ""High levels of debt amid subdued growth continue to constrain fiscal space, making it harder for governments to borrow and invest. Conflicts hamper investment in parts of Africa and Western Asia,"" it said.
It added that the past 20 years have been marked by several large crises alongside major shifts in the geopolitical and economic landscape.
""In the early 2000s, the global economy experienced a period of significant expansion driven by globalisation, advancements in technology and robust economic growth in large developing countries, notably China and India,"" the report said, adding that the rise in global demand during this period fuelled a commodity boom.
Global trade activities were also buoyed by the proliferation of global value chains as well as key milestones in trade liberalisation, including China's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001 as well as the earlier formation of the European Union in 1995.
""Against this backdrop, global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows grew rapidly. This strong performance came to a halt in 2008. Developed economies were hit hard by the 2008 world financial and economic crisis, which caused severe recessions and massive job losses,"" the report said.
Citing the example of digital payments in India, the report further said that advances in fintech have facilitated financial inclusion. Fintech providers have enhanced access to and the use of digital financial services for individuals and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). They have improved the affordability and personalisation of financial product services that make them more relevant for diverse customer needs.
""Prominent examples include mobile payment services such as M-PESA in Kenya and online payments and messaging apps in developing countries such as China and India,"" it said.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, fintech companies played a notable role in enabling quick-yet-contactless deployment of government support measures via digital financing to MSMEs and individuals, especially those living in marginalised and poor communities.
With only six years remaining to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, hard-won development gains are being reversed, particularly in the poorest countries. If current trends continue, the UN estimates that almost 600 million people will continue to live in extreme poverty in 2030 and beyond, more than half of them women.
""This report is yet another proof of how far we still need to go and how fast we need to act to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"" UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said.
""We are truly at a crossroads and time is running out. Leaders must go beyond mere rhetoric and deliver on their promises. Without adequate financing, the 2030 targets cannot be met,"" she said.
According to the report, debt burdens and rising borrowing costs are large contributors to the crisis. Estimates are that in the least developed countries debt service will be 40 billion dollars annually between 2023 and 2025, up more than 50 per cent from 26 billion dollars in 2022.
Stronger and more frequent climate-related disasters account for more than half of the debt upsurge in vulnerable countries. ""The poorest countries now spend 12 per cent of their revenues on interest payments -- four times more than they spent a decade ago. Roughly 40 per cent of the global population live in countries where governments spend more on interest payments than on education or health,"" it said.
""We're experiencing a sustainable development crisis, to which inequalities, inflation, debt, conflicts and climate disasters have all contributed,"" UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Li Junhua said.
""Resources are needed to address this, and the money is there. Billions of dollars are lost annually from tax avoidance and evasion, and fossil fuel subsidies are in the trillions. Globally, there is no shortage of money; rather, a shortage of will and commitment,"" he said.

Reserve Bank of India leads surge in gold reserves amid global central bank slowdown,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/reserve-bank-of-india-leads-surge-in-gold-reserves-amid-global-central-bank-slowdown/articleshow/109080048.cms,06-04-2024,"The
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) stood out with its continued accumulation of
gold reserves
. Weekly data from the
RBI
revealed a 6-tonne increase in gold holdings in February alone.
This brings the total year-to-date buying by the RBI to over 13 tonnes, with total gold reserves now reaching 817 tonnes.
India's consistent efforts to bolster its gold reserves reflect a strategy aimed at diversifying its
foreign exchange reserves
and mitigating risks associated with currency fluctuations and
economic uncertainties
.
While India remains a significant player in the global gold market, other
central banks
also contributed to the accumulation in February.
Central banks around the globe continued their steady accumulation of gold reserves, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous month, in February.

This trend has been predominantly driven by emerging market banks, particularly those of India and China, as reported by the World Gold Council.
According to a report Published in the World Gold Council by Senior Analyst, EMEA World Gold Council, Krishna Gopal, global central banks increased their gold reserves by a net of 19 tonnes in February.
While this marks the ninth consecutive month of growth, it represents a significant slowdown from January, with a 58 per cent decrease in net purchases.
Despite the deceleration, the broader trend of central bank buying remains intact. Year-to-date data for January and February shows an addition of 64 tonnes, indicating a fourfold increase compared to the same period in 2022, although it's notably 43 per cent lower than the corresponding period in 2023.
The People's Bank of China (PBoC) emerged as the largest buyer during the month, increasing its gold reserves by 12 tonnes.
However, amid the overall trend of accumulation, there were notable instances of selling as well.
Despite the slower pace of accumulation witnessed in February, analysts remain optimistic about the outlook for central bank demand for gold.
The broader trend indicates a continued interest among central banks in diversifying their reserve assets, particularly amidst geopolitical uncertainties and economic volatility.
Looking ahead, market observers anticipate the release of the next Gold Demand Trends report in late April, which will provide comprehensive insights into central bank demand for the entire first quarter of the year.
Overall, while the pace may have moderated in February, the underlying trend suggests that central banks, including India's RBI, remain committed to bolstering their gold reserves as a strategic hedge against global economic uncertainties.

India seeks to attract $100 billion a year in FDI as it woos investors looking beyond China,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-seeks-to-attract-100-billion-a-year-in-fdi-as-it-woos-investors-looking-beyond-china/articleshow/109079524.cms,06-04-2024,"India aims to attract at least $100 billion a year in gross foreign direct investment, a top official said, as the South Asian nation courts investors looking to diversify away from
China
.
“Our target is that we will average at least $100 billion over the next five years. The trend is very positive and upward,” Rajesh Kumar Singh, secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, said in an interview in New Delhi.
The ambitious target compares with an annual average of more than $70 billion in
FDI
in the five years through March 2023 and would be a reversal in trend after last year’s decline. Singh said that the figure for the current fiscal year will be “closer to” the $100 billion target.
Bloomberg
The world’s fastest-growing major economy is appealing to businesses that want to hedge against geopolitical tensions by spreading their operations more broadly — sometimes called a “China plus one” strategy. Companies like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. have boosted manufacturing in India, taking advantage of incentives offered by Prime Minister
Narendra Modi

Still, foreign investment hasn’t matched the pickup in local manufacturing. Singh attributed that to higher inflation and interest rates in developed nations, as well as geopolitical conflicts and risk perception about emerging markets.
India has “unmatched market growth opportunity in a variety of sectors such as electric vehicles, electronic goods or general consumer goods, where penetration levels in our population is far lower than the global average,” he said in the interview Thursday. He vowed that the government will take more steps to ease FDI rules.
Boosting the share of manufacturing in India’s economy has been one of the key promises made by Modi, who is seeking a third term in elections that start on April 19.
The government’s production-linked incentive program has already helped boost manufacturing and reduce India’s dependence on imports for products like tellecommunications and auto components, Singh said. He cited export growth that’s been driven by new industries. “We have at least 39 new medical devices being made in India that were never made,” he said.
The administration has plans for several new industrial corridors that would likely get approval within the first 100 days of a new government, Singh said. He acknowledged that the incentive plan has made slow progress in the steel and textile industries, and cited plans to expand the list of items covered under it.
The government is also working to address delays in granting visas to Chinese vendors and professionals who are needed to install machinery, an issue that’s been raised by businesses, Singh said.
“Short-term visas should be provided to Chinese technicians, as we are trying to boost our own manufacturing,” he said.

that has been restrained over the past few quarters from leaping. However, risks to price stability have not entirely receded into the background, said RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, after the first policy review meeting in the new fiscal year.
Global Headwinds
There are likely spillovers from global developments such as high
public debt
in developed markets and an uncomfortable increase in commodity prices, including that of crude oil, which climbed $10 a barrel from the last review meeting in February on uncertain geopolitics and supply constraints.

""Two years ago, around this time, the elephant in the room was inflation,"" said Das. ""The elephant has now gone out for a walk and appears to be returning to the forest. We would like the elephant to return to the forest and remain there on a durable basis.""
While the
Monetary Policy Committee
(
MPC
) did not explicitly mention the global
interest rate
scenario where the
Federal Reserve
Chairman Jerome Powell was cautious about easing too early, it echoed the sentiment that easing at this juncture could undo the gains made.
""As the central banks navigate the last mile of disinflation, financial markets are responding to changing perceptions on the timing and pace of
monetary policy
trajectories,"" the MPC said in its statement.
Monetary policy must continue to be actively disinflationary to align inflation to the target of 4% on a durable basis, Das said. An ET poll of 14 respondents had said the MPC would keep the
repo rate
unchanged at 6.5%.
""The undercurrents that face the RBI MPC are similar to the
US Fed
,'' said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Group.

"Even at all time high of $645.6 billion, RBI to continue to accumulate reserves",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/even-at-all-time-high-of-645-6-billion-rbi-to-continue-to-accumulate-reserves/articleshow/109070766.cms,06-04-2024,"The central
bank
will continue to accumulate
foreign exchange reserves
even though it is at an all-time high as it looks to strengthen its position to counter
volatility
due to spillovers.
India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at a record $645.6 billion as of March 29.
“We have been consciously building reserves over the past four five years as the market moves prevailing upon the market situation,” said central bank governor
Shaktikanta Das
at the post-policy media briefing Friday. “That effort continues because it acts as a buffer against future risks especially in situations when the cycle turns and there is significant outflow of dollars.”
To be sure, reserves started depleting from September 2021 onward, after it had peaked at $642.45 billion on September 03, 2021. The Reserve Bank was selling dollars since then whenever the rupee weakened against the dollar beyond its comfort level.

“The decline then was also partly due to the valuation impact,” Das said. “The
RBI
used its forex reserves in a judicious manner.”
But the reserves started picking up steadily since early December 2023 and have crossed the September 2021 levels after almost two and a half years.
Governor Das, in his
monetary policy
statement, has said that the external sector is resilient and the latest external vulnerability is eminently manageable. The country’s forex reserves are at 99.6% of outstanding
external debt
at end-December 2023.
“It is our duty to build a strong buffer of reserves when it rains heavily,” Das said. ”This whole approach adds to the strength of the national
balance sheet
.”
Currently, the reserves are equivalent to 11.3 months of projected merchandise imports in 2023-24, still lower than the levels that one saw before the global financial crisis of 2008, when for months the import cover was as high as equivalent to up to 15 months’ imports.

"CBDC transaction volumes down, P2M transactions growing: RBI",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cbdc-transaction-volumes-down-p2m-transactions-growing-rbi/articleshow/109066280.cms,05-04-2024,"The Central

Digital
Currency
(CBDC)
transaction
volumes have gone down after crossing 10 lakh in late-December 2023,
Reserve Bank of India
Governor T Rabi Sankar said on Friday. The overall number of transactions has touched 2.2 crore since the launch of the
CBDC
pilot on December 1, 2022, Sankar said, adding that the number of participants in the pilot stands at 50 lakh.
""Volumes have not been the same, they have come down,"" Sankar said, adding that the target of 10 lakh a day was met earlier on the back of measures such as interoperability with a very popular
UPI
platform.
As per a news report, banks disbursed employee benefits using the digital rupee in December, which helped the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) meet its target of 10 lakh daily transactions.
Sankar said there are 46 lakh users and 4 lakh merchants transacting in CBDC right now, and added that as the acceptance of CBDC grows, there has been a growth in the P2M, or peer-to-merchant, transactions.
""Volumes are shifting from P2P (peer to peer) to P2M as more merchants are available,"" Sankar said.

Sankar also said the programmability feature on the CBDC kickstarted on Friday, with a use case, where a farmer was transferred
money
designed specifically for buying agricultural inputs.
A closed-user group within the bank is testing newly developed offline CBDC use cases, Sankar said, adding that the same will be launched for the public later.
It can be noted that earlier in the day, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had proposed to make CBDC-retail accessible to a broader segment of users by enabling non-bank
payment
system operators to offer CBDC wallets.
The move will facilitate testing of the resiliency of CBDC platform to handle multi-channel transactions, Governor Shaktikanta Das had said.

CBDC pilots in the Retail and Wholesale segments are underway with more use-cases and more participating banks. While the number of retail CBDC users is 46 lakh, the number of merchants using CBDC is 4 lakh. The CBDC Retail (CBDC-R) pilot currently allows for Person to Person (P2P) and Person to Merchant (P2M) transactions using Digital Rupee wallets provided by selected banks.
“The objectives of the pilots is to try out various alternative technologies, use cases,” said T Rabi Shankar deputy governor RBI. “Last year we tried to test the resilience of the system if the transactions are raised to 1 million. This target was achieved and it was helpful in rolling out interoperability of UPI.”
RBI has found that volumes are moving to P2M from P2P.
There are around 50 lakh participants and total transactions is around Rs 2.2 crore, said Sankar.

The RBI, continuing with this approach, has now proposed to make CBDC-Retail accessible to a broader segment of users in a sustained manner, by enabling non-bank payment system operators to offer CBDC wallets. “This is expected to enhance access and expand choices available to users apart from testing the resiliency of the CBDC platform to handle multi-channel transactions. Necessary changes will be made to the system to facilitate this,” said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies.
At present, the CBDC pilot is operational across 13 banks including
State Bank of India
,
ICICI Bank
,
Yes Bank
, and
IDFC First Bank
. Later
Bank of Baroda
,
Union Bank of India
,
HDFC Bank
, and
Kotak Mahindra Bank
were included.
CBDC, also known as Digital Rupee or e₹, is a digital version of physical currency, offering trust, safety, and easy settlement like cash. However, it doesn't earn interest and can be converted into other forms of money. The RBI creates and distributes CBDC tokens to Token Service Providers (TSPs), who then distribute them to users for transactions, similar to physical cash.
Earlier this year, RBI had earlier added programmability and offline functionality to the digital currency as part of the CBDC pilot program for better reach and connectivity to areas with poor internet connectivity. This would allow government agencies to ensure payments are made for specific benefits, while letting companies allocate funds for today where farmers are transferred CBDC for expenses such as business travel. RBI had said that these functionalities will be introduced in a phased manner to expand the participation of more banks, users, and locations.
“The first use case in programmability was introduced today where farmers can use CBDC for their input. RBI is testing the offline connectivity in closed group and will open up once it settles.,” said Sankar.

Indian securitisation market growth expected to slow as co-lending gains traction: ICRA,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indian-securitisation-market-growth-expected-to-slow-as-co-lending-gains-traction-icra/articleshow/109041561.cms,04-04-2024,"Growth
of the Indian
Securitisation market
is set to slow this fiscal year keeping the trend witnessed in the last quarter of fiscal 2024 as non banking finance companies and banks get into
co-lending
reducing the demand for such papers.
If similar trends continue, Rating company
ICRA
projects securitisation volumes to cross Rs 2 lakh crore this fiscal, from Rs. 1.9 lakh crores in the last fiscal year. The securitisation volumes in the last quarter of fiscal 2024 fell 24% to Rs. 48,000 crores, from Rs. 63,000 crores a year earlier. The overall market volumes expanded by 25% in the fiscal full year to Rs 1.9 lakh crore.
“The increasing share of co-lending by the
NBFCs
and HFCs would challenge the growth in the securitisation market, though at this juncture we expect an increase in both forms of funding”, said Abhishek Dafria, Senior Vice President,
ICRA
Ratings.
India's securitisation market has been growing in fits and starts as various regulations and the demand for such papers have been fluctuating. While banks and other investors have been buying such papers, the rising
private credit market
with Alternative Investment Funds are yielding higher returns, outpacing securitised papers.
Bank originated volumes grew 50% to Rs. 10,000 crores in fiscal 24, from Rs. 6,600 crores in fiscal 23. This can be attributed to banks trying to find new ways to raise funds as cost of funds for banks increase due to repricing of deposits and shift of depositors from current and savings account to term deposits impacting their Net Interest Margins.

“Securitisation can be an efficient funding avenue for banks, without attracting incremental cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio requirements”, said Wazeem Aboobacker, Associate Director,
CRISIL Ratings
. “We are likely to see more banks, especially those with higher credit-deposit ratios, evaluate securitisation in the near to medium term.”

The GST remained at a high point during the last fiscal with collections reaching a record high of Rs 1.87 lakh crore in April 2023 and the second-highest collection coming in at Rs 1.78 lakh crore in March 2024.
The gross tax collection target, as per the revised estimate, stood at Rs 34.37 lakh crore for FY24.
Tax collection is a reflection of economic activity. India is recording a world-beating growth rate and is projected to grow at 7.6 per cent in 2023-24, as per NSO estimates.
Domestic consumption and government capex are the main drivers of the country's economic momentum.
Indian economy grew by over 8 per cent for three consecutive quarters (April-December), and various agencies have revised the growth estimates of India for FY24 closer to 8 per cent.
SBI Research and Moody's expect GDP growth for FY24 to be 8 per cent. Fitch and Barclays raised their growth forecast to 7.8 per cent.

's endeavour always is to promote a robust and resilient financial intermediation system with an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework.

financial sector
as they have immense potential to increase the reach of financial firms, enhance the range of product offerings and conveniences for customers, expand the ambit of finance to hitherto excluded segments.
""At the same time, we need to be alert to the possibilities that the new entrants into the
financial services
space, including
FinTech firms
, could significantly alter the universe of financial services providers,"" the deputy governor said.
This could affect the degree of market concentration and competition and may give rise to new challenges, he added.
In his speech, he touched upon various aspects of regulations.

On containing risks from pro-cyclical lending, Rao said unbridled credit growth and any laxity in credit discipline or underwriting standards can be deleterious to the health of the financial entity concerned and if widespread, could give rise to systemic concerns.
""From this perspective, in recent times, credit offtake towards the consumer credit segment, especially the unsecured portfolio was observed to be quite substantial. Also, increasing dependency of NBFCs on bank borrowings was leading to regulatory concerns,"" he said.
Although asset quality at broader portfolio level was not exhibiting any major signs of stress, the consistent high credit growth reported in the above segments warranted regulatory intervention.
Accordingly, certain quantitative and qualitative measures were undertaken from a
macro-prudential perspective
.
""As regulators, we would want to ensure continuous vigil to mitigate risks emerging from both within and the periphery of the financial eco-system,"" the senior RBI official said.
Citing an example, Rao said the digital lending guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank envisage that regulated entity undertakes the due diligence required for lending decisions even when the loan is being sourced through a lending service provider (LSP).
The increased reliance of banks/NBFCs to identify and onboard borrowers through fintech partners should not mean lowering of underwriting standards and improper pricing of risks, he added.
The deputy governor emphasised that even as the financial landscape evolves and transforms, the underlying principles of good governance, robust risk management, effective compliance, customer protection and responsible business conduct will be increasingly relevant.
A robust culture within the organisation which delivers financial services while embracing these principles will stand the system and the Institutions in good stead in the long run, he added.

Tax collection is a reflection of economic activity. India is recording world-beating growth rate and is projected to grow at 7.6 per cent in 2023-24, as per NSO estimates.
Domestic consumption and government capex are the main drivers of the country's economic momentum.
India grew above 8 per cent for three consecutive quarters (April-December) and various agencies have revised the growth estimates of India for FY24 closer to 8 per cent.
SBI Research and Moody's expect GDP growth for FY24 to be 8 per cent. Fitch and Barclays raised their growth forecast to 7.8 per cent.

asset monetisation
in
financial year 2023-24

Taxman puts some FPI assessments on hold for more information,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/taxman-puts-some-fpi-assessments-on-hold-for-more-information/articleshow/108953897.cms,02-04-2024,"After a flurry of probing questionnaires over the past few months, the income tax (I-T) department has held back
assessment orders
on several foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to fish out more information on them from jurisdictions such as
Mauritius
.
While the matters, mostly relating to the financial year 2021-22, became time-barred on March 31, 2024, the
tax office
has invoked the provision under the law to buy more time on the grounds that efforts are underway to obtain more facts.
The final assessment orders have not been issued to around 10 funds, industry sources told ET.
""Probably, they were not convinced by the responses from the FPIs, and are keen to establish their case of 'lack of substance' in the fund structures in the tax havens,"" said a banker.
According to Rajesh Gandhi, partner at Deloitte India, which advises many offshore portfolio managers, in some selective cases assessments have been kept on hold and information has been sought from Mauritius under the inter-government exchange of information arrangement.

""In such cases, the tax officer gets another year to pass the assessment orders. It is not clear what additional information has been sought from Mauritius,"" said Gandhi.
The final assessment orders pertaining to FPIs were keenly awaited this year given the detailed nature of queries from the tax officials. ET had reported a month ago that some of the funds were asked whether they had borrowed money to trade on stock exchanges; a few notices had asked the FPIs to share minutes of old board meetings held years authorising the purchase and sale of securities and as well as the opening of bank accounts in Mauritius. Most funds were told to disclose their ""beneficial owners"" and ""authorised signatories"".
""It's likely that the tax office may share the information with the capital market regulator. However, the I-T has accepted the explanations given by many funds,"" said another person.
If the department intends to prove the age-old suspicion that the funds (which have been picked for further enquiry) have been running just a paper outfit in Mauritius with actual decision-making happening in New York or London, then it would need the cooperation of Mauritius authorities to fish out more data. Such inadequate 'substance' would be a ground to question tax benefits that FPIs enjoy under the treaties India has with Mauritius and Singapore.
As per these tax treaties, FPIs from these financial centres pay no tax on gains from equity futures and options trading on exchanges here. Besides, under the revised terms of the treaties, there is no tax on FPIs' capital gains made on the sale of shares that were purchased before April 2017.

"Dividend from non-financial CPSEs at ₹63,749 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/dividend-from-non-financial-cpses-at-63749-crore/articleshow/108953820.cms,02-04-2024,"The
government
's
dividend
collections from non-financial central public sector enterprises (
CPSEs
) and entities in which it holds minority stakes scaled a new peak of ₹63,749 crore in 2023-24, showed the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (
DIPAM
) data released on Monday.
The dividend
revenue
represents an increase of about 27.5% over the revised estimate of ₹50,000 crore for the financial year and beats the earliest best of ₹59,533 crore in 2022-23, reflecting strong performance by state-run firms across sectors. Dividend receipts in March alone totalled almost ₹12,200 crore.
Disinvestment
Revenue
Meanwhile, disinvestment proceeds in 2023-24 fell just short of expectations and touched ₹16,507 crore, mainly as the
IDBI Bank
sell-off process spilled over to this
fiscal
. The government had factored in a disinvestment revenue of ₹18,000 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24, DIPAM secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had said after the interim budget in February.
In the absence of any strategic sale, the divestment proceeds were generated through the government's dilution of minor stakes in 10 entities, mostly via the offer for sale (OFS) route. These include the OFS of
Coal India
(₹4,186 crore),
NHPC
(₹2,488 crore),
NLC India
(₹2,129 crore),
Rail Vikas Nigam
(₹1,366 crore),
SJVN
(₹1,349 crore) and
IRCON International
(₹1,193 crore). The IPO of
Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency
fetched ₹858 crore.

and service providers have urged the government to stop routing domestic deals involving
foreign currencies
like dollars via the US banking system to avoid
transaction fees
and save foreign currency. Intercontinental Consultants and Technocrats (ICT) chairman
K K Kapila
said at present a transaction fee is levied on US dollar transactions within the country.
Citing an example, Kapila said payment in USD from Delhi to even nearby Faridabad from one entity to the other in the current dispensation is required to be undertaken through the US banking system.
""This should be undertaken directly through the
Reserve Bank of India
and there should be no requirement of routing them through the American Banking system,"" he said.
Kapila pointed out that a small country like the Philippines does not route its internal foreign exchange transactions through the United States. India can also do the same, he added.

government
has garnered Rs 16,507 crore by selling minority stake in state-owned companies in 2023-24 fiscal, lower than what was projected in its
revised estimates
. During the 2023-24 fiscal, which ended March 31, the government sold stakes in 10 central
public sector enterprises
(CPSEs) through offer for sale (OFS).
Share sale in
Coal India
fetched Rs 4,186 crore, while in
NHPC
and
NLC India
it garnered Rs 2,488 crore and Rs 2,129 crore, respectively. The government raised Rs 858 crore though initial public offering of IREDA.
The government also sold shares in
RVNL
,
SJVN
,
IRCON International
,
HUDCO
and earned remittances from SUUTI.
The
budget
had pegged
disinvestment
proceeds for 2023-24 fiscal at Rs 51,000 crore. However, the revised estimates (RE) on February 1, 2024, did away with separate head for disinvestment receipts.
Under the heading of capital receipts, the government estimated to collect Rs 30,000 crore. Officials said this include Rs 20,000 crore from disinvestment and RS 10,000 crore from asset monetisation.
Live Events
The actual collections for FY'24 through OFS and share sale to employees at the end of March 31, 2024, stood at Rs 16,507.29 crore, according to the data on the website of DIPAM (Department of Investment and Public Asset Management).
The government historically has been missing the disinvestment targets set in budgets with the exception of 2018-19 and 2017-18 financial years.
The highest ever mop-up from disinvestment at Rs 1,00,056 crore was recorded in 2017-18, marginally exceeding the budget target of Rs 1 lakh crore.
In 2018-19, the government collected Rs 84,972 crore from CPSE disinvestment, higher than Rs 80,000 crore pegged in the Budget for that year.

""The extra funds were released to the rural development ministry a few days ago (in March). This will be enough to cater for the improved demand,"" said the official, who did not wish to be identified. This was the second time in 2023-24 that the government released urgent assistance for MGNREGS. The first such transfer was of ₹10,000 crore in the third quarter of the fiscal which was subsequently adjusted against the supplementary demands for grants of ₹26,000 crore. Work demand from individuals under the MGNREGS, which had declined marginally in the June quarter, grew in the range of 9.5-19.5% each month between July and October from a year before, driving up the expenditure under the programme. The demand was mainly driven by erratic seasonal rains that prevented the typical large-scale migration of rural workers into farming, forcing them to hold on to work under the MGNREGS, according to experts.
However, demand from individuals again contracted from November, mirroring improved economic activity. The economic growth rate of 8.4% in the third quarter beat analysts' projections and pushed up the full-year forecast to 7.6% from 7.3% predicted earlier, according to the second advance estimate of the National Statistics Office. Still, an up to 10% increase in the daily wage rate under the scheme across states in 2023-24 prevented any sharp moderation in the wage cost.
India witnessed ""below normal""
monsoon
in 2023, the first in four years, as overall rainfall touched 94% of a benchmark long period average. This upset the government's initial projections of a sharp deceleration in work demand from the 2022-23 level on the back of improved economic activity.

"Centre gets a dividend boost as receipts from state-run undertakings surpass revised estimates by 26% to Rs 63,000 cr",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/dividend-receipts-from-cpses-exceed-revised-estimates-by-26-pc-to-rs-63k-cr/articleshow/108912317.cms,31-03-2024,"The Centre's kitty got a boost as
dividend receipts
from state-run undertakings exceeded the revised
budget estimate
by 26 per cent to about Rs 63,000 crore. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had revised dividend receipts in the Interim Budget to Rs 50,000 crore for the current fiscal.
Among the PSUs, Coal India, ONGC,
Powergrid
and
GAIL
were the top dividend payers to the government. In March, the government received hefty dividend tranches from
ONGC
(Rs 2,964 crore),
Coal India
(Rs 2,043 crore), Power Grid Corporation of India (Rs 2,149 crore),
NMDC
(Rs 1,024 crore),
HAL
(Rs 1,054 crore) and
GAIL
(Rs 1,863 crore).
In the last fiscal (2022-23), dividend receipts stood at Rs 59,952.84 crore.
Higher dividend is a reflection of the robust financial performance of
CPSEs
during the 2023-24 fiscal. The payouts by CPSEs also benefit retail and institutional shareholders and will help generate interest in PSU shares.
As per DIPAM's capital restructuring guidelines, CPSEs which do not have plans to deploy their capital optimally for business purposes should have a professional look at the surplus funds available to them.
Live Events
The CPSEs sitting on cash piles are required to pay dividends, which will, in turn, help keep investors interested in the stock.
The combined market capitalisation of CPSEs, banks and insurance companies has grown 500 per cent in the past three years from Rs 15 lakh crore to Rs 58 lakh crore.
Also, the government's equity holding has risen 4 times to Rs 38 lakh crore from Rs 9.5 lakh crore in January 2021.

India's improving savings-investment dynamic amid lower deficits,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-improving-savings-investment-dynamic-amid-lower-deficits/articleshow/108884678.cms,30-03-2024,"If there is one figure which captures a country's changing
savings-investment dynamic
, it is the current account. It captures the gap between overall
domestic savings
in the economy and domestic investment. The lower the
current account deficit
, lesser is the dependence on external savings, to finance investments.
Post the taper tantrum, there has been a marked
reduction
in India's current account deficit from 4.8% of
GDP
in FY13 to an average deficit of 1.1% per annum over FY14 to FY21. This reduction is due to steeper fall in investment as a percentage of GDP, which outpaced reduction in overall domestic savings. Gross Fixed Capital Formation reduced from 34.3% of GDP in FY12 to 27.3% in FY21.
However, since FY22, there has been a gradual increase in investments (Gross Fixed Capital Formation) to 30.7% in FY23. Despite the pick-up in investments, the current account deficit has remained well contained at 2.0% of GDP in FY23. This is because gross domestic savings also picked-up to 30.2% of GDP in FY23 from 29.1% in FY21.
The improvement in domestic savings since FY22, reflects reduction in general government deficit (centre plus states). Or alternatively lower dis-saving by the government at -2.3% of GDP in FY23 v/s -6.7% of GDP in FY21. Corporate savings (both private and public sector) increased over this period, to 14.1% of GDP in FY23 v/s 13.1% in FY21. This more than balanced the reduction in household savings, from 22.7% of GDP in FY21 to 18.4% in FY23. The reduction in household savings is due to reduction in financial savings while physical savings which is mostly in real estate has picked-up to 13.3% of GDP in FY23 v/s 10.9% in FY21.
In FY24, the current account deficit is expected to narrow even further to 1% of GDP. The reduction in current account deficit is due to improvement in domestic savings to 31.9% of GDP in FY24 from 30.2% in FY23. The improvement in domestic savings is likely led by further reduction in general government
fiscal deficit
, reflecting lower in central government fiscal deficit. Meanwhile, corporate savings has likely risen further in FY24. Household physical savings is expected to hold-up in FY24, reflected by pick-up in household mortgage loans.

The combination of lesser dissaving by the government sector and rise in corporate savings is being channelled into investments. Resulting in investment (Gross Fixed Capital Formation), estimated to rise to 31.3% of GDP in FY24 from 30.7% in FY23. The rise in investments is being led by the household sector with resources being channelled into real estate sector. Household's investment has risen to 12.9% of GDP in FY23 from 10.7% in FY21. Corporate investments have also picked-up to 13.8% of GDP in FY23 from 12.8% in FY21. The focus on capital expenditure led by Central government has supported a rise in General Government investment to 4.0% of GDP in FY23 from 3.9% in FY21.
Looking ahead, in FY25 we expect these dynamics to persist with continued healthy saving-investment dynamics. Current Account Deficit is expected to be moderate at 1.3% of GDP in FY25. Savings will be supported by further consolidation of fiscal deficit led by both Centre and State governments. This is expected to support continued recovery in investments supported by greater channelisation of resources by households into real estate. Private corporate investment is also expected to improve with rising capacity utilisation levels and healthy corporate and bank balance sheets.

"Centre to borrow ₹7.5 lakh crore in H1FY25, eyes ₹12,000 crore via green bonds",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-to-borrow-7-5lcr-in-h1-of-fy25-eyes-12kcr-via-green-bonds/articleshow/108829706.cms,28-03-2024,"The Centre will borrow ₹7.5 lakh crore from the
market
through dated securities in the first half of FY25, which makes up 53.1% of the full-year target of 14.13 lakh crore, the
finance ministry
said on Wednesday.
The sum is lower than the usual
borrowing
of about 57-60% of the total for a
fiscal year
in its first half. This is in part due to the upcoming elections in April-May, when official spending is expected to decelerate a bit, experts said.
A lower borrowing target for the first half would have a benign impact on
bond yields
.
Of the projected borrowing, the government will raise ₹12,000 crore via sovereign
green bonds
in the first half of FY25, the ministry said.

Greenshoe option
It has also introduced a new dated security with a 15-year tenor, citing market feedback and global market practices. ""The sharp 15.5% year-on-year fall in the government's gross supply (of papers) in the first half of FY25, along with the bond index inclusion starting end-June, is expected to augur well for G-sec yields,""
Icra
chief economist Aditi Nayar said. She expects yield on the 10-year G-secs to ease to 6.8-7% during the first half, from 7.07% on Wednesday.
JPMorgan has announced that it will include Indian
government bonds
in its widely tracked emerging market debt index, starting June 2024.
In the interim Budget last month, the government had reduced the FY25 gross market borrowing target to Rs 14.13 lakh crore from Rs 15.43 lakh crore in FY24, as it went on a fiscal consolidation drive.
The borrowing in the first half is scheduled to be over in 26 weekly tranches, each ranging from Rs 20,000 crore to Rs 38,000 crore, the ministry said. The share of borrowing, including through the green bonds, under different maturities will be: 3-year (4.80%), 5-year (9.60%), 7-year (8.80%), 10-year (25.60%), 15-year (13.87%), 30-year (8.93%), 40-year (19.47%) and 50-year (8.93%).
The government also keeps the right to exercise a greenshoe option to retain an additional subscription of up to Rs 2,000 crore against each of the securities indicated in the auction calendar. It will continue to carry out switching of securities to ""smoothen the redemption profile"", the ministry said. Weekly borrowing through
treasury bills
in the first quarter of FY25 is expected to be Rs 27,000 crore for the first seven auctions and Rs 22,000 crore for the subsequent six auctions, it said. There will be a weekly treasury bill issuance of Rs 12,000 crore under the 91-day category, Rs 7,000 crore under the 182-day and Rs 8,000 crore under the 364-day brackets in the first seven auctions.

Balancing fintech regulation with innovation tricky: World Economic Forum official,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/balancing-fintech-regulation-with-innovation-tricky-world-economic-forum/articleshow/108754752.cms,26-03-2024,"Financial regulators
across countries have the ""tricky"" task of striking a balance between regulations and
innovation
, given the rapid strides in technological advancement, said Matthew Blake, head of the
World Economic Forum
's Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems.
Countries in the Asia-Pacific (Apac) region have a more accommodative regime for fintech firms than others, said Blake who is a member of WEF's executive committee.
Citing a January 2024 report by WEF and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, he said about 70% of the surveyed fintech entrepreneurs gave the regulatory environment in the Apac region a favourable rating, higher than the global average of 63%.
""If you're a regulator, understanding the technological innovations that are happening (at a brisk pace) and then applying an appropriate framework to try and protect people from being scammed is not an easy task,"" Blake told ET in an interview.
In India, the Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) and other
regulators
and the finance ministry seem to be holding regular deliberations with relevant sectors, he said. ""My sense is there's a push to self-regulate. I think those are good steps,"" he added.

There are instances of frauds by those who seek to take undue advantage of innovation.
""So, the regulator needs to thread the needle in a way where it's not easy (to perpetrate fraud),"" Blake said.
""But the bottom line is right now, it feels like the entrepreneurs and the regulators are on somewhat of an even keel. Whether or not the regulatory environment becomes stricter if you see more frauds - that's a question to be seen.""
In India, fintech regulations came under heightened public glare in recent months after the RBI imposed restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank Ltd, reportedly for the entity's failure to comply with KYC norms and on money laundering concerns, among others.
Vibrant economy
The Indian economy is expected to remain ""robust"", remaining a major contributor to global growth, Blake said. However, elevated inflation and interest rates, which are by and large global challenges, could pose risk to growth, he indicated.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast India's FY24 growth to touch 6.7%, more than double the global average.
Crypto challenges
Blake said the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems will put out a research report on digital assets in the next few months, which will enable policymakers who are still deliberating what to do to make informed decisions about
crypto assets
.
He said his team is in the process of studying digital asset policies and regulations in different jurisdictions including the UAE, Singapore, the US, Europe and a few others, and assessing the intended and unintended consequences flowing from such regulations.
India's push for a global framework to regulate crypto assets, given the cross-border nature of such transactions, is a ""laudable"" goal to pursue, Blake said.
At present, different jurisdictions have adopted different regulatory standards for crypto and some have outrightly banned it, he added.

Lending rates to start easing only in second half of FY'25: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/lending-rates-to-start-easing-only-in-second-half-of-fy25-report/articleshow/108623488.cms,19-03-2024,"The
Reserve Bank of India
is expected to ease
liquidity
conditions in FY'2024-25, but its impact on
lending rates
would be seen only in the second half of the fosca; 2024-25,
India Ratings
said in its outlook for FY' 2024-25.
“While fiscal and
regulatory tightening
will continue,
monetary conditions
starting with the
banking system
liquidity beginning to ease” said Soumyajit Niyogi, Director Core Analytical Group. “However, the overall lending rates are likely to remain elevated and easing, if any, will be visible only from 2HFY25 ”.
Bank deposit rates are unlikely to rise further. But the structural shift in the system will keep downward rigidity intact. Hence, banks’ lending rate is expected to remain high in FY’25 with some modest softening towards the end.
On the other hand, regulatory tightening and pricing dynamics in the
capital
market suggest the prevailing rates will continue and any decline in risk-free rates will be compensated by an increase in credit premium by widening of the credit spread and term structure, the ratings firm said. Commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposits (CD) rates are expected to ease in sync with the easing of liquidity conditions and a constructive view on the monetary policy.
The expectation of easing of monetary conditions will be visible in the short-term rates according to the ratings firm. But long term yields in the banking system and bond markets would remain broadly at an elevated level,it said.

Given the expectation of limited supply of bonds and higher demand from investors, IndRa expects bond issues to be higher in FY’25 than in FY’24.
The consequence of increase in CIC is to be reflected in the banking system liquidity, which is already in deficit on an average. However, given the elections are scheduled during 1Q, the impact on the credit will be modest, as the first quarter is a lean season for credit. The agency expects government spending to gain traction in the starting of the new fiscal along with the Reserve
Bank
of India’s dividend transfer, said India Ratings.

debt recovery process
, the
Finance Ministry
has set up a panel to suggest amendments to the
SARFAESI
and DRT Acts, including a provision for granting
legal sanctity
to
e-notices
to debtors, sources said. The committee headed by an Additional Secretary held several meetings, and discussions are in the advanced stage in this regard, sources told PTI.
Last month, the Finance Ministry held extensive deliberations with the top brass of banks and Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) to enhance the efficacy of DRTs for expeditious
recovery of debts
.
""We have formed a committee led by the Additional Secretary to decide on relevant amendments. The aim is to make the debt recovery process less tedious and more effective. We are also planning to introduce a provision to provide legal sanctity to e-notices.
""So that an SMS and e-mails sent by banks can be considered as notice. This will help in fast-tracking the recovery of debt,"" sources said.
The Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) Act was enacted in 1993 to provide a legal framework for the expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions.

However, the efficacy of this legislation in expediting debt recovery proved to be limited. As a result, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act 2002 was enacted to address these shortcomings and provide a more robust framework for debt recovery.
The government has undertaken several amendments to the
DRT Act
and the
SARFAESI Act
over the years.
The last changes in the law were made in 2016, when the government had moved amendments to the SARFAESI Act, and the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) Act in Parliament to make debt recovery more effective.
The Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (Amendment) Act, 2016 amended the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, and the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and the Depositories Act, 1996.
The changes were aimed at a faster and more transparent system to tackle the bad debts in the banking system by fast-tracking the recovery process for banks and other financial institutions.
Other than this, the government has taken various initiatives to control non-performing assets (NPAs). As a result, the net
NPAs
of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) have declined to Rs 1.36 lakh crore (0.95 per cent) in March 2023 from Rs 2.31 lakh crore (3.13 per cent) in March 2015.

income tax department
has recovered ₹73,500 crore of
pending dues
in this financial year up to March 15, on the back of a targeted
recovery plan
drawn up as part of efforts to step up collection of
outstanding tax arrears
, officials said.
Of the total, pending
corporate tax dues
amount to ₹56,000 crore, ₹16,500 crore is
personal income tax
and ₹50 crore is undisclosed income from
foreign assets
, said a senior official.
""We have recovered about ₹73,500 crore and the number may go up further,"" the official told ET on condition of anonymity. The department had collected over ₹52,000 crore in FY23.
The official said while it was difficult to give year-wise details of outstanding dues, the collection averaged 8% of annual outstanding till 2021-22, which went up to 10.78% in 2022-23 and is about 17% in this fiscal so far. Pending
tax arrears
, which had crossed ₹21.94 lakh crore in January 31, 2023, from ₹15 lakh crore in April 2021, have been a key area of concern for the tax department.
Live Events
The department had drawn up a roadmap to help it recover outstanding dues more efficiently, including identification of cases where recovery was possible, use of technology to track untraceable defaulters and handing out zone-wise targets to field formations.
""This year the recovery is much better and in the last two-and-a-half months only we have recovered ₹37,000 crore,"" said the official cited earlier. In some cases, arrears date to assessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05, for which the department tracked defaulters through the use of technology. In some cases, though taxes had been paid, they were not reflecting in their system and effort was on to update the database, the official said.

"Government's dividend collection from CPSEs hits record Rs 61,149 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/governments-dividend-collection-from-cpses-hits-record-rs-61149-crore/articleshow/108571950.cms,18-03-2024,"New Delhi: The
government
's
dividend
mopup from non-financial central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and entities in which it holds minority stakes has touched a record ₹61,149 crore, 22% higher than the
revised estimate
for 2023-24, with almost a fortnight to go this fiscal, according to the latest
finance ministry
data.
Dividend receipts in the first half of March alone totalled nearly ₹10,000 crore. The revised estimate in the interim budget last month estimated the
dividend collection
for 2023-24 at ₹50,000 crore, higher than initial target of ₹43,000 crore.
""The dividend collection has surpassed all expectations this fiscal. CPSEs across sectors have been performing well, and the strong dividend flow is the clearest sign of that,"" said an official, who did not wish to be identified. ""Also, global crude oil prices didn't quite surge as was feared after the Israel-Hamas war in October last year. So, the profitability of
oil companies
didn't quite take a beating, which augurs well for dividend flow. Power sector companies, too, have been doing well.""
Higher dividend would offset any potential shortfall in the government's miscellaneous receipts, which include disinvestment and monetisation, from the revised estimate of Rs 30,000 crore for this fiscal.
Live Events
This month, the government has received dividends of Rs 2,149 crore from
Power Grid Corporation of India
, Rs 2,043 crore from
Coal India
, Rs 1,115 crore from
NTPC
, Rs 1,054 crore from

NHPC
, Rs 647 crore from
Power Finance Corporation
, Rs 188 crore from
National Aluminium Company
and Rs 67 crore from
Cochin Shipyard
, according to the official data.
The total receipts by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which comprise disinvestment and dividend collection, have touched Rs 75,886 crore. The disinvestment revenue so far this fiscal stands at Rs 14,737 crore.
The DIPAM's dividend receipts had hit a record Rs 59,533 crore last fiscal, driven significantly by the payment of about Rs 9,000 crore by Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) for the government's 29.54% holding in the miner.
The CPSE dividend flow has been fairly broad-based this fiscal, even though HZL's payout hasn't been as generous, said officials.
The DIPAM had issued an advisory on a consistent dividend policy in 2020, which has also served to nudge CPSEs not to hold back on such payouts for no reason.

So far, corporates have paid Rs 6.72 lakh crore in advance tax while individuals accounted for Rs 2.37 lakh crore.
“Advance

But, with the central bank's last ERM dating back to 2012, this was work that had to be done, it said.

AI increases cybersecurity challenges manifold for financial institutions: RBI Guv Das,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/ai-increases-cybersecurity-challenges-manifold-for-financial-institutions-rbi-guv-das/articleshow/108529349.cms,15-03-2024,"Mumbai:
Reserve Bank
Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday said that with the advent of artificial intelligence (
AI
),
cybersecurity challenges
can rise manifold, and called upon
financial institutions
to dedicate substantial efforts to protect
customer information
. Regulated entities serve as repositories of data on financial transactions, customer interactions, and operational activities, the governor said in his inaugural address at the Annual Conference of RBI Ombudsman here.
""Within this extensive repository lies a unique opportunity to enhance customer service through robust data analysis,"" he said.
By harnessing the power of
data analytics
, Das said regulated entities can proactively anticipate customer needs, address issues promptly, and streamline processes. A data-driven approach would not only optimise operational efficiency but also reinforce the commitment to providing exemplary customer service.
He noted that with the rise in
fraudulent transactions
, it is critical to strengthen monitoring systems and use technology to detect potential frauds before they materialise.
""Maintaining a focus on root cause analysis of consumer grievances can result in preventing such complaints from coming up repeatedly. With the advent of AI, cybersecurity challenges can rise manifold,"" he said.
Live Events
Cybersecurity challenges can expose consumers to
identity theft
, fraud, and unauthorised access to personal information, which can affect consumer trust.
""Financial Institutions must dedicate substantial efforts to protect customer information and ensure that vulnerabilities exposing customers to risk are promptly identified and addressed,"" the governor said.
He further said the litmus test of the working of any institution or entity is the efficacy of its
grievance redressal
mechanism.
Fragmentation and inefficiency in grievance redressal mechanisms can hinder the timely resolution of consumer complaints, he said, adding that multiple layers and lengthy resolution processes should, therefore, be avoided.
The Reserve Bank-Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS, 2021) has brought in several structural changes in the operations of the Ombudsman scheme. Under the RB-IOS scheme, 2.34 lakh grievances were received during the first full year of its operation (2022-23), followed by 2.68 lakh grievances in the current financial year (2023-24) so far.
The disposal rate in both years has been about 98 per cent. The average turnaround time for closure across all categories of complaints has come down to 33 days for 2022-23 from 57 days prior to the introduction of the new scheme.
""Our analysis of the grievances received at the offices of the RBI ombudsman reveals certain gaps in the systems and procedures in the regulated entities. We have brought such deficiencies to the notice of the individual banks and NBFCs. Our effort is to work with the regulated entities and rectify such deficiencies,"" Das said.
He stated that while the Offices of Ombudsman need to intensify data analytics and use of technology for streamlining the internal processes, the adoption of a similar approach by the regulated entities is crucial for upholding public trust.
There is also a need for further strengthening the internal grievance redress systems, including the internal ombudsman framework in the regulated entities, the governor said.

Cos under recast get more time to file modified income returns,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cos-under-recast-get-more-time-to-file-modified-income-returns/articleshow/108503461.cms,15-03-2024,"In a major relief to
companies
undergoing
business reorganisation
such as amalgamation,
merger
or demerger, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (
CBDT
) has allowed them to file
modified returns
of income with an extended deadline.
Companies undergoing business reorganisation, particularly those involved in schemes of amalgamation, merger, or demerger or succession post insolvency sanctioned by competent authorities, after June 2016 but prior to April 1, 2022, may now file modified return up to June 30, CBDT said in an order issued on Thursday.
Experts said the CBDT decision underscores the government's commitment to a business-friendly ecosystem as it brings relief to companies whose reorganisation orders were issued before the implementation of the Finance Bill 2022.
The bill mandated entities undergoing business reorganisation from April 1, 2022, onwards to furnish modified returns of income post reorganisation. However, it was applicable only for companies where sanction order for restructuring was issued between April 1, 2022, and September 30, 2022. This left companies with reorganisation orders issued before April 1, 2022, in a procedural conundrum. Many even approached the court.
The latest order by CBDT recognises delays in reorganisation orders and problems with filing returns by the successor company, experts said.

"Centre may save ₹45k cr on lower capex by states, subsidy payout",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-may-save-45k-cr-on-lower-capex-by-states-subsidy-payout/articleshow/108503447.cms,15-03-2024,"The Central government's fiscal 2024 spending is expected to be about ₹45,000 crore less than the revised estimates presented with the budget on February 1, because of lower
capital expenditure
and subsidy pay-out.
The savings could mainly come from the
subsidy bill
on account of softening
fertiliser prices
, under-utilisation of funds by states, including for their capital spending and interest from states on money parked in single nodal agency accounts, a senior official told ET. The government, in the budget presented last month, had revised its 2023-24 expenditure estimate to ₹44.90 lakh crore from the previously budgeted ₹45.03 lakh crore.
Any unspent amount from the
revised estimate
, backed by improved
tax collections
, could help the Centre further trim its
fiscal deficit
from the budgeted 5.8% of gross domestic product unless there is some last-minute adjustment necessitating an additional outgo, the official said.
The Centre had revised its fiscal deficit target for fiscal 2024 to 5.8% of GDP in the current fiscal year from the 5.9% gap forecast in the budget for the year. Its total expenditure is estimated at ₹47.66 lakh crore.

""Despite the hike in LPG and food subsidy, the total subsidy bill is likely to be lower by ₹8,000 crore from the revised estimate,"" the official added.
The FY24 allocation for fertiliser subsidy was revised to ₹1.89 lakh crore from the budgeted ₹1.75 lakh crore. However, moderating global fertiliser prices, reduced import volume and efficient subsidy utilisation could result in the lower subsidy outgo. The Centre also expects about ₹15,000 crore saving against the revised Rs 1.05 lakh crore capex loan target for states this fiscal year.
While the finance ministry is pushing states to exhaust the entire allocated amount for this fiscal year to bolster their capex, based on the utilisation so far, a portion of the outlay may remain unspent, said officials. The Centre has been extending, in recent years, a 50-year loan to states at zero interest to build durable assets and help boost economic growth.
""We have released ₹90,000 crore (in capex loan to states) so far and are ready to release another ₹10,000 crore next week if there are takers. However, the states are unlikely to be able to use up the entire amount,"" the official added.

"Northeast among biggest gainers of GST, says Finance Minister Sitharaman",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/northeast-among-biggest-gainers-of-gst-says-finance-minister-sitharaman/articleshow/108503243.cms,15-03-2024,"Finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
on Thursday said
north-eastern states
have remained the Modi government's centre of focus and they have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the goods and services tax (
GST
) regime that has pushed up their
indirect tax collections
.
Speaking at the
Indian Institute of Technology
in Guwahati, Sitharaman said the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of GST revenue of the north-eastern states has been 27.5% since its introduction in 2017-18. This was way above the CAGR of 14.8% under the earlier indirect tax regime. Elevated tax mop up has enabled these states to spend more on development programmes, she added.
The minister termed as ""historic"" the
Tata Group
's decision to set up a ₹27,000-crore indigenous
semiconductor assembly
and test facility in
Assam
, highlighting that the state is now attracting new-age businesses, and not just the traditional ones.
Sitharaman said investors can take advantage of the north-eastern region's geographical proximity with south-east Asian nations, including Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, to expand their reach and market access.
Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
has laid the foundation for seven cancer hospitals in Assam, which is aimed at making the region a
medical hub
, Sitharaman said.

"Unicorns to add $1 trn to economy by 2030, generate 50 mn jobs: CII study",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/unicorns-to-add-1-trn-to-economy-by-2030-generate-50-mn-jobs-cii-study/articleshow/108500061.cms,14-03-2024,"New unicorns are likely to add USD 1 trillion to the
Indian economy
, which would reach USD 7 trillion size by 2030, and add 50 million new jobs, according to a report released by industry body CII on Thursday. Startup firms valued over USD 1 billion are categorised as unicorns.
The report 'Unicorn 2.0: Adding the Next Trillion' has been prepared with McKinsey & Company as the knowledge partner, the chamber said.
The
CII report
introduces an ambitious 'Unicorn 2.0' scenario, envisioning the
startup ecosystem
's potential to add USD 1 trillion to India's estimated USD 7 trillion economy by FY30, thereby creating over 50 million jobs.
Sectors such as retail and e-commerce, next-gen financial services, manufacturing, and SaaS and digital are poised to drive massive growth in the coming years.
The first unicorn was seen in India in 2011, and after a decade, India has crossed the mark of 100 unicorns. The combined valuation of 113 unicorns is USD 350 billion as of January 2024.
Live Events
The industry body said that the emergence of over 100 unicorns is a remarkable achievement, attributed to several pivotal factors, which encompass a digitally adept young population facilitated by widespread access to mobile internet, the growth of the middle class, and a supportive regulatory framework.
CII President R Dinesh stated that the startup ecosystem is a vibrant tapestry woven with threads of innovation, resilience, and transformative ideas.
""As we dissect the components that foster growth, we navigate through the realms of
economic contribution
, job creation, and ground-breaking innovations that redefine industries,"" he said.
Chandrajit Banerjee
, Director General of CII, opined that startups and their corporate counterparts contribute significantly to India's economy, injecting an impressive USD 140 billion in fiscal 2022-23.
""Projections suggest this could rise to USD 1 trillion by 2030. The impact of startups goes beyond balance sheets. Socially, these enterprises can be architects of change. Initiatives aimed at
societal betterment
in India, from education and healthcare to sustainability, underscore the commitment of startups to positively impact communities,"" Banerjee added.
According to the findings of the CII report, India's 100-plus unicorns and about 100,000 startups have contributed a significant 10 to 15 per cent to GDP growth between 2016 and 2023.
Moreover, rapid digitization has not only transformed urban centres but has also permeated rural areas, catalysed inclusivity and driving the creation of 20-25 per cent of all new employment opportunities.
Startups are playing a pivotal role in powering India's economy across 9 sunrise sectors - manufacturing; IT and digital services; agricultural ecosystems; healthcare services; travel and tourism, modern retail and e-commerce; next-generation financial services; communication, media and entertainment; and skills and education. These sectors not only serve as current growth engines but are also projected to spur further growth, employment, and can have 20-23 times impact on exports by FY30.
India is home to 20 times more startups today than in 2015, going from 4,000 to over 100,000. Startups and related corporate ventures have contributed an estimated USD 140 billion in economic value in FY23.

"Indian economy is resilient... changes in bilateral trade are a huge opportunity, says Crisil CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indian-economy-is-resilient-changes-in-bilateral-trade-are-a-huge-opportunity-says-crisil-ceo/articleshow/108373977.cms,11-03-2024,"For those wondering why
private sector capex
is not visible, here's an answer - it has reached a critical stage from where it is beginning to flow - said , CEO at Crisil, the biggest rating company that has the pulse of the Indian corporate world. Recent regulatory actions may slow the growth rate, but there is no trouble in sight, Mehta told Bhaskar Dutta and MC Govardhana Rangan in an interview. Edited excerpts:
The latest
GDP growth
numbers surprised everyone. There are divergent views on it and we aren't seeing private capex yet. What are the corporates telling you?
There are a few parts to this. One is the
PLI
(production-linked incentive scheme). It's very targeted - 15 sectors - and it's going to happen. Then there is
conventional capex
, the point that you are talking about. We are looking at
capacity utilisation
across multiple segments right now. What we are seeing is that in the top eight key segments, the capacity today is higher than the decadal average capacity utilisation that we have seen across those segments whether you take cement, steel, oil and gas, etc. Cement and steel plants are already expanding, refining is talking about green capex investment. Capex investment in these companies is at 13-14% versus 7-8% earlier. We are talking 13-14% growth in fixed assets. They have now started investing at a higher pace than earlier.
The next question is about the sustainability of this growth. Can this be repeated?
The resilience of the
Indian economy
is on the back of continued domestic demand and consumption. We are not seeing the impact that we would have expected with the interest rates moving up. Interest rates went up by 250 basis points and because of that, we will see some impact on consumption. We have moderated our next year's GDP (growth projection) to 6.8%. Global trade continues to see an impact because Europe still continues to be slow. The US is better. That will have its own impact on the Indian economy. Further, the fiscal discipline of the government means that its expenditure would be a little controlled. We are hoping for a normal monsoon, so the agriculture sector will be okay. At 6.8%, India would still be the fastest-growing major economy.
If the government slows spending, the private sector has to step in. Which would be the top?
We are going to see investments in three different areas. On PLI, the government has put a scheme - ₹3 lakh crore is expected. ₹1 lakh crore has already been done and another ₹2 lakh crore is likely to happen in the next two to three years. Most of it will happen in 2024 and 2025, that's where the impact will be because the scheme is being driven in that fashion. You also have emerging sectors - semiconductors, and renewables.

What is beyond these headline projects...
There's a huge
opportunity
for India at this point in time because there are a lot of changes happening from a
bilateral trade
perspective. There was a global supply chain network, which was set up 10-20 years back. People went to the lowest-cost locations and went for scale. That's how China and some of the other countries came up. I think at this point in time, with all the things which have happened from the geopolitical side, what's happening from the perspective of friendly relations between countries presents a huge opportunity for India.
Even 20 years ago, there were opportunities being spoken of. What is the difference between the opportunities from then and now?
The entire logistics of getting things into India if you're importing from wherever you are - for instance, in Indian ports, the turnaround time has actually become half versus 10 years back. Then you have road connectivity. The connectivity of highways right up to whatever locations you want. Port connectivity, rail connectivity and road connectivity - the investments which have been made in these three sectors - are showing you traction. The interconnectedness of these three - when you talk about creating logistics paths, you make sure that you're enabling that. Now, there are people who are ready to commit. That only happens when all of this is available.
How has that helped?
The other enabler is on the digital infrastructure side. Just look at FASTags, look at GST, which has removed all the toll roadblocks. The efficiency has gone up. Earlier, a truck in India could only do two trips from one part to the other at best in a month. Today, six trips are possible. That is the conversion because of the efficiency that has come in.
What more needs to be done?
Of course, we need to look at reforms, because ultimately the pace of economic growth will depend on what sort of reforms are being done. Whether there are labour reforms, whether there are land acquisition reforms. I think those will need to be looked at. Agricultural reforms - because agriculture still remains a large labour force. I would also look at the productivity side of things. We expect manufacturing as a percentage of GDP to grow because we are seeing a huge impetus there - it's 17.5% of GDP and likely to go to 20% as far as we think.
Crisil estimates that ₹30-35 lakh crore of debt will be needed to be funded by the private sector alone for capex. How do you fund it with a shallow bond market?
There are a couple of things happening. One is, that with global bond index inclusion happening, there will be space created for investment in the infrastructure sector. The other is that if you look at some of the parameters of the A-rated companies now with the AA companies in 2016-17, they are virtually similar. What this means is that A-rated companies today are where AA companies were six to seven years back. If you look at risk-adjusted returns for A-rated companies today, you are seeing a 50-basis-point higher return versus what you see in AA-rated companies. A-rated companies are improving in their fiscal discipline and that is a huge opportunity. Financial savings in mutual funds are largely going to equity. If you're able to demonstrate stability and good risk-adjusted returns, it will come back into debt. Global investors would want to invest in bonds in the infrastructure space.
Banks are key for any growth funding. Given the scramble for deposits, how do you see things unfolding?
We see an increase in the cost of deposits for banks because it's taking time for the costs to be passed down. We will see some impact on net interest margins by maybe 10-20 basis points. But the return on assets is healthy. Also, they are going to see some benefits on credit costs because of just the sheer efficiency. The impact might be offset by some of the benefits that banks may see on credit costs. Overall, we don't see too much of a challenge on profitability. There will be some impact which is likely to happen but not necessarily something which we are worried about - we don't think it will be material.
With the RBI having curbed excessive growth in some lending segments, how will NBFCs fare?
For NBFCs, we expect the growth to continue. It might be one or two percentage points lower than last year. Housing and vehicle demand is going to continue, The only place where you might see some impact is the unsecured retail credit where growth is already moderating. Let's be very clear, it is already moderating because that is what is the intent - to bring that growth down, to be mindful about that growth.
This means that the NBFCs will have to tighten their assurance and their credit underwriting processes. They will need to make sure that the due diligence that they are applying to that portfolio is stronger. Their costs have anyway gone up because the risk provisioning has gone up from the banks' side. What we are seeing so far is that it might have a few basis points worth of an impact on the growth in the retail credit side, which is unsecured credit. But all the other segments are likely to continue to grow.

States' capex focus pivots away from roads to social services,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/states-capex-focus-pivots-away-from-roads-to-social-services/articleshow/108373567.cms,11-03-2024,"The
capital expenditure
of states on
roads
is
budgeted
to slow down in FY25 as they focus on other
social services
and try to meet their
fiscal targets
, as per ET's analysis of
Budget
documents.
The share of states'
spending
on roads in the total capital spending will decline to 21.7% in FY25 from 21.9% in the current fiscal, according to the Budget documents of 21 states and Union Territories (UTs).
In FY23, the share was higher at 24.7%. ""Road capex has slowed down because of a shift towards social services, specifically public health, family welfare and education,"" Paras
Jasrai
, senior analyst at India Ratings and Research, told ET.
Jasrai said that this is also a post-pandemic phenomenon, where the share of social services increased to 32% from 22% in the pre-pandemic period. ""Post-pandemic states have realised that there is a requirement to support and develop human capital,"" Jasrai said. Fiscal considerations may also dampen capital expenditure.
Live Events
Madan Sabnavis, Bank of Baroda's chief economist, said, ""Compromises are being made to ensure fiscal targets are met.""
States are trying to reduce their fiscal deficit to 3% of GSDP in FY25 from 3.4% in the previous year. ET's analysis of 21 states and UTs found that state spending on roads and bridges is set to expand by 7% in FY25, compared with the 22% growth witnessed in the previous year. These 21 states/UTs will likely spend ₹1.85 lakh crore in FY25 compared with ₹1.73 lakh crore spent in the previous fiscal, as per the revised estimates. Of the 21 states/UTs, nine will likely witness a reduction in road spending in FY25 compared with the previous year.
Bihar's capex on roads, for instance, is likely to be ₹3,818.6 crore in FY25--nearly half of ₹6,935.9 crore in FY24. Assam and
Madhya Pradesh
are expected to witness a 24% decline. West Bengal's spending is set to decline by 13.4%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and Telangana are likely to step up their spending on roads by over a third.
The capital expenditure on roads is also budgeted to grow at a slower pace for the Centre, decelerating to 3% in FY25 from 28% in the current fiscal. The share of roads in the Centre's total capex will likely come down to 24.5% from 27.8% in the current and previous fiscal.

Unspent Central funds to states to be settled in real time from Apr 1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/unspent-central-funds-to-states-to-be-settled-in-real-time-from-apr-1/articleshow/108277013.cms,07-03-2024,"Settlement of the unspent amount from the funds that the
Centre
sends to states through the
single nodal agency
(SNA) will happen within a day from April 1, eliminating the need to
park it outside
the
government account
for more than 24 hours.
The SNA account is used for transferring funds to states for centrally sponsored programmes and there are timelines for the expenditure. The settlement of unspent money currently happens on a
quarterly or monthly basis
. The Department of Expenditure and the
Reserve Bank of India
are working together to upgrade the SNA system to settle the unused amount by the states in real time, which will also eliminate disputes over the payment of interest earned on such unspent funds lying in state SNAs, officials in the know said.
The government and the banking regulator have already launched a pilot project in five states and will implement it across India from April 1, they said.
""This is taking the SNA functionality to the next level, making the usage of funds more efficient and in a more transparent manner,"" a senior official told ET.

Currently, states are earning interest accrued on the unutilised funds lying with the state-level single nodal agencies, the official said. Several states have not paid interest on the Centre's share on such funds, he added.
With most of the states not complying with the communication sent to them on sharing of the interest, the Centre has said unless the states pay the interest by March 31, it would not release the 50-year interest free loans offered to them. ""With the new SNA functionality, that dispute will not arise and states have to exhaust the amount before getting the fresh sanction,"" the official said.
This will also eliminate any possibility of diverting the fund to another account.
Last year, finance secretary
TV Somanathan
said how data analytics helped the Centre detect that some states were parking money from SNA accounts to some other bank accounts, which was prohibited. The Centre had budgeted to provide ₹1.3 lakh crore to states as interest-free, long-term capex loans for the ongoing fiscal year. However, the target was cut to Rs 1.05 lakh crore, with some states failing to meet the eligibility criteria to receive the loan.
For the fiscal year 2025 also, the Centre has budgeted an outlay of ₹1.3 lakh crore as interest-free, long-term capex loans to states.

apex court
made the observation while it was hearing a suit filed by the Kerala government accusing the Union of India of interfering in the exercise of its ""exclusive, autonomous and plenary powers"" to

The dialogue between the Centre and the state must not stop merely because of the pending suit, the court said while stressing on the need to resolve the issue.
""Let all the senior officials who are capable to take decision and who are already involved in decision making sit together and resolve this,"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and K V Viswanathan said.
The Kerala government had told the top court on February 19 that a meeting held on February 15 failed to make much headway in resolving the contentious issue.
Appearing for the Kerala government on Wednesday, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the state was left with no choice but to agitate the issue. Sibal said he wanted to inform the court with a ""heavy heart"" that though the issue needed to be resolved in the spirit of cooperative federalism, it has not.

At the moment, Sibal said, the state needed a breather.
The bench said Sibal had submitted a note at the last hearing where he gave a brief description about an agreement that was probably reached at the February 15 meeting. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkataraman, appearing for the Centre, had also given a note, the court recalled.
The notes, the bench recalled, said since Kerala has challenged the Centre's power to impose conditions on borrowing, the state's request for additional borrowing can only be considered after it has withdrawn the suit.
""What we only want to suggest you right now is that you don't insist on the condition of withdrawal of the suit,"" the bench told the Centre, adding the
Government of India
can impose other conditions for improved fiscal management.
With Attorney General R Venkataramani and ASG Venkataraman representing the Centre, the bench said, ""You cannot say withdraw the suit. That is a constitutional right under Article 131 (of the Constitution).""
Article 131 empowers the apex court to deal with disputes between the Centre and a state or between states.
Sibal said there was a need to tackle the issue today as the state needs to borrow a certain amount.
""It is not that the Union has picked out something which is only adverse to a particular state,"" the attorney general said.
The bench, while taking note of their arguments, said the matter requires ""very serious consideration because fiscal mismanagement of the states is an issue with which the Union must be concerned because ultimately it has its own impact on the nation's economy"".
At the previous hearing, the apex court was told that in the February 15 meeting, the Union of India had said it was going to release over Rs 13,000 crore to the state straightaway. The bench observed the Centre has said it will approve release of Rs 13,608 crore to the state.
""As regards their (Kerala) additional demand, let a meeting be held today itself in the afternoon or may be tomorrow,"" the court said.
The ASG, while advancing his arguments, said fiscal deficit is on ""deep decline"" and that India is better placed than G-7 nations in terms of economic stability.
The bench concurred with him and observed that the world was recognising the robustness of India's economy.
""Even in judicial functions, when we go outside the country, there we get this kind of feel... It is not based on perception. It is based on correct facts and figures and the strong pillars on which the economy is surviving and thriving,"" the bench said.
The bench said the dialogue between the Centre and the Kerala government on the issue must not stop. ""The dialogue must continue. That is the strength of the relationship between the Union and the state,"" it said.
The bench said it will not fix a next date for hearing the matter and the parties were at liberty to mention it whenever they want.
The Kerala government has approached the Supreme Court accusing the Centre of interfering in the exercise of its ""exclusive, autonomous and plenary powers"" to regulate the state's finances by imposing a ceiling on net borrowing.
In an original suit filed under Article 131, the Kerala government has said the Constitution bestows fiscal autonomy upon states to regulate their finances under various articles, and the borrowing limits are regulated by a state legislation.
In a note submitted before the top court, the Centre had said uncontrolled borrowing by states would affect the credit rating of the whole country, and that the fiscal edifice of Kerala has been diagnosed with ""several cracks"".

States borrowing cost falls to 32-week low of 7.40 percent,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/states-borrowing-cost-falls-to-32-week-low-of-7-40-percent/articleshow/108241749.cms,05-03-2024,"Amid continuing
lower supplies
, the
borrowing cost

32-week low
of 7.40 per cent Tuesday, down by 4 bps from the previous week's auctions. Throughout January, the interest rates were hovering at a two-year high of close to 7.9 per cent. Then rates started falling after states began to auction lower than earlier disclosed debt after the
government cleared
the Central share of tax devolution in early February.
Eleven states raised Rs 28,000 crore from
state government securities
(
SGS
), which is 27 per cent lower than the Rs 38,200 crore indicated for this week in the auction calendar, according to a note by
Icra Ratings
.
As a result, the
weighted average
cut-off eased by 4 bps to 7.40 per cent, the lowest in the past 32 weeks.
The fall in the pricing was despite a mild increase in the weighted average tenor to 15 years from 14 during the week.
The spread between the cut-off of the 10-year state bonds and the benchmark 10-year G-sec (7.18 GS 2033)
yield narrowed

Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra emphasised the crucial role of enforcement in ensuring the success of the GST system.
Malhotra outlined key priorities - targeting high-risk areas, combating tax evaders, balancing enforcement with taxpayer rights, strengthening collaboration between central and state authorities, and gathering feedback for improvement in policy and technological interventions.
Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) chairman Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said that fake entities and GST evasion not only erode revenue but also distort fair competition and fuel an underground economy.
He highlighted the importance of strong data analytics, the use of technology and the need to stay ahead of the perpetrators of GST evasion.
Agarwal also reminded the officers to follow the instructions issued by CBIC with respect to the procedure to be followed during enforcement action.
The nationwide crackdown on fake registrations and bogus billing from May 2023 alone has resulted in the detection of ITC tax evasion of Rs 49,623 crore, involving 31,512 bogus firms.
CBIC officers have detected fake ITC evasion of Rs 1,14,755 crore from the year 2020 till date.
During the conference, Maharashtra state GST officers said they have identified 41,601 suspected non-genuine taxpayers, out of which 6,034 NGTPs were detected based on various intelligence gathered during registration, e-way bills and inputs from CBIC/other states and outlined the steps taken to improve detection rate at an early stage.
It was decided to conduct the National Conference of Enforcement Chiefs of State and Central GST Formations bi-annually moving forward, the statement added.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has previously spoken about ""Ram Rajya"" and how his government is working for the benefit of the people of Delhi in accordance with its principles. He has highlighted the 10 principles of AAP's governance inspired by ""Ram Rajya', which include ensuring no one goes hungry, providing equal and quality education and healthcare, 24-hour access to electricity, water supply, pilgrimage opportunities for the elderly, ensuring safety for citizens and women, employment for all, controlling inflation, and equal opportunities for all.
Finance Minister Atishi presented her first budget, while for the AAP government, it will be the 10th such annual exercise. The budget holds greater significance in light of the upcoming Lok Sabha election. With a focus on ""Ram Rajya"" in the budget, the party aims to send a message to voters about AAP's model of governance and politics, which is not only religious but also has a socialist character, according to party sources.
Before presenting the budget, Atishi sought the blessings of Manish Sisodia's mother and wife, both senior AAP figures. Sisodia, the former Deputy Chief Minister, had been arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 26 in connection with the excise policy case. He had resigned from the cabinet after his arrest. Last year, Kailash Gahlot had presented the budget in his absence.

CPSE dividends cross FY24 revised estimate in 11 months,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cpse-dividends-cross-fy24-revised-estimate-in-11-months/articleshow/108147224.cms,02-03-2024,"The government’s
dividend
collection from non-financial central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and other investments so far this fiscal has breached the revised estimate to touch Rs 51,556 crore, reflecting robust profitability of these entities, showed the latest finance ministry data.
The interim budget last month estimated such dividend receipts at Rs 50,000 crore for the current fiscal, higher than the initial target of Rs 43,000 crore.
“The dividend receipt could exceed Rs 55,000 crore by the end of this fiscal, with CPSEs in various sectors like power doing well,” a senior official told ET.
Higher dividend would offset any potential shortfall in the government’s miscellaneous receipts, which include disinvestment and monetisation, from the revised estimate of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24.

The total receipts by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (
DIPAM
), which comprise disinvestment and dividend mop up, have touched Rs 64,164 crore. The disinvestment revenue so far this fiscal stands at Rs 12,609 crore.
CPSEs, including
ONGC
,
GAIL
,
NTPC
,
Coal India
,
Power Grid Corporation
, IRFC and
SAIL
, have forked out dividends this fiscal, boosting the government’s revenue.
Last fiscal, DIPAM’s dividend receipts had touched a record Rs 59,533 crore, driven significantly by the payment of about Rs 9,000 crore by
Hindustan Zinc Ltd
(HZL) for the government’s 29.54% holding in the miner. Such a generous dividend from HZL is unlikely this fiscal as it has depleted its cash reserves.
However, prospects of robust dividends by large state-run oil firms have brightened from the situation 3-4 months ago when oil prices remained elevated in response to the geopolitical tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war.
Officials had then apprehended that if the global crude oil prices kept rising and state-run oil firms didn’t pass on the costs to consumers in the build-up to the 2024 general election (expected in April-May), their profitability and ability to pay dividends could falter. However, CPSEs from some other sectors, such as power, had been doing well and might continue to give good dividends, they had said.

States' borrowing cost decline marginally to 7.44 per cent,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/states-borrowing-cost-decline-marginally-to-7-44-per-cent/articleshow/108048624.cms,27-02-2024,"The
borrowing cost
for
states
continued to fall for the third week in a row, with the weighted average price falling to 7.44 per cent in the
debt auction
on Tuesday. The cost had remained at a two-year high throughout January sniffing at 7.8 per cent.
However, the overall cost has been falling since the interim Union Budget, which forecast a lower than anticipated borrowing and a
fiscal deficit
target of 5.8 per cent for this fiscal and 5.1 per cent for the next financial year.
The weighted average cut-off rate eased by 2 basis points to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday, with issuance trailing the indicated amount for the fifth consecutive week, Icra Rating said in a note.
Twelve states raised Rs 32,800 crore through State Government Securities (SGS) on February 27 and the amount is 27 per cent lower than the highest-ever weekly auction of Rs 45,200 crore indicated for this week in the fourth quarter auction calendar.
Both limited supply and the falling overall
interest rates
pulled down the weighted average cut-off to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday from 7.46 per cent last week despite a mild increase in the weighted average tenor to 14 years from 13 years, Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra, said.

On May 19, 2023, RBI announced withdrawal of Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes from circulation.
As on January 31, nearly 97.5 per cent of the Rs 2,000 banknotes were returned to the banking system, and only about Rs 8,897 crore worth of such notes are still with the public.
The total value of Rs 2,000 banknotes in circulation was Rs 3.56 lakh crore at the close of business on May 19, 2023, when the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 banknotes was announced.
Public and entities holding such notes were initially asked to either exchange or deposit them in bank accounts by September 30, 2023. The deadline was later extended to October 7, 2023. Deposit and exchange services at bank branches were discontinued on October 7, 2023.
Starting October 8, 2023 individuals have been provided with the choice of either exchanging the currency or having the equivalent sum credited to their bank accounts at the 19 offices of RBI.
The Rs 2,000 banknotes were introduced in November 2016, following the demonetisation of the then-prevailing Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 banknotes.

improved across lending and deposit rates in January. However, the cumulative rise in most deposit and lending rates remained lower than the 250 basis points of repo rate increase by the RBI since May 2022, the report said.
This incomplete transmission of

""We believe that the central bank will be active in liquidity management and adopt regulatory measures to prevent excesses in credit growth. We foresee the RBI cutting rates from June 2024,"" it said.

credit discipline
helps to access new borrowing opportunities and also helps them better manage debt according to a report by credit bureau Transunion Cibil.
With the number of Indian consumers enrolling to monitor their credit Score rising 73% in 2023, a new global study by the credit bureau has found that the benefits are shown to lead to better credit profiles, greater access to credit, or an improved ability to
pay down debt
, depending on the intent of consumers who monitor credit.
In India, 92% of surveyed consumers said that it is important to monitor their credit with nearly two fifths (39%) saying it’s extremely important. This finding demonstrated that consumer awareness of credit monitoring is high and is a likely driver behind the surge in monitoring activity in recent years, a release by the credit bureau said.
The survey findings show that the most common reason Indian consumers initially signed up for credit monitoring services was to improve their
CIBIL Score
(38%), to protect against fraud (34%), and to learn of credit offers they qualify for (29%).
Additionally, after using monitoring services for some time, consumers reported added benefits that credit monitoring has allowed them to achieve: learn how to monitor and manage their CIBIL Score (43%), get better credit offers (43%), learn how to make regular payments (40%), gain visibility to changes on their credit report (33%), and pay down debt (28%).

.
The realisation in the December quarter—Rs 4,281 crore from 79 firms—seems to have been hit by long delays in resolution. About two dozen of these rescued firms saw the resolution processes stretching beyond four years, well beyond the stipulated time frame of 270 days, suggesting erosion of the stressed asset value.
The recovery, however, was 74.7% of the fair value of the stressed companies when they were admitted for resolution and 128.6% of the liquidation value of these companies, according to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India data.
The cumulative recovery since the insolvency regime came into force in late 2016 stood at Rs 3.21 lakh crore, or 31.9% of the claims that were admitted by the adjudicating authority relating to the 891 stressed firms.
To be sure, the cumulative proceeds were 86.6% of the fair value of the rescued companies (when the IBC was invoked), based on the proceeds involving 783 resolved cases. The realisation in all the resolved cases was 168.6% of the liquidation value of the firms.

Experts, however, have advised against judging the IBC’s performance based on the recovery rate for any one quarter, arguing that the law is still the best tool for bad debt resolution. The recovery rate under the IBC is way above that through other channels such as Lok Adalat, Debt Recovery Tribunal or the SARFAESI Act, they have said. Also, recovery prospects hinge on when the IBC proceedings are invoked against a stressed firm--the more is the delay, the greater is the chance of lower realisation.

The state government led by CM
Stalin
said that the revised estimate for 2023-24 was also higher than the budget estimates for the same year which was pegged at Rs 37,540 crore.
Thangam Thennarasu
, who replaced PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan as the state's Finance Minister last year, presented his maiden paperless, e-budget which he said was aimed at achieving the 'Tamil dream' through seven objectives - social justice, welfare of the marginalized, transforming young Tamils as global achievers, knowledge based economy, equality focused on welfare of women, sustainable green future and Tamil language and culture.
""The revenue expenditure is estimated at Rs. 3,48,288.72 crore in Budget Estimates 2024-25 which shows an increase of 9.70 per cent over revised estimates for 2023-24,"" he said. ""The revenue expenditure is estimated to be Rs. 3,59,949.99 crore in 2025-26 and Rs. 3,89,005.49 crore in 2026-27.""
In his speech, the state's FM hit out at the Centre when he said that the Union government was stifling the state by exercising arbitrary and discriminatory control over Tamil Nadu's finances.
""The imposition of stringent conditions on the borrowing ceiling by the Union Government has unduly restricted the ability of the State to raise resources to fund its development initiatives,"" he said.
Live Events
Further, he added that the 'inordinate delay' by the Union Government in approving the Chennai Metro Rail Project has forced Tamil Nadu to incur the entire project expenditure so far from its budgetary resources, resulting in an expenditure of Rs 9,000 crore in the current year.
""Further, the termination of GST compensation regime since 30.06.2022 has caused a revenue shortfall of approximately Rs 20,000 crore per annum. Under these challenging circumstances, the Budget for the year 2023-24 had been presented in March last year,"" he explained.
Thennarasu added that during the current year, this situation was further aggravated by the onslaught of twin disasters, which caused a severe strain on the state finances.
""While unanticipated expenditure to provide necessary cash relief assistance and to undertake temporary and permanent restoration works has been incurred, there has also been a significant dip in the revenue collections,"" he said. ""Despite multiple requests, the Union Government has not provided any support to the State from the National Disaster Response Fund.""
As per the Budget, Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs 1,08,690 crore for 2024-25, which is 3.44 per cent of the GSDP. In line with the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, the FM said the Government is following the 'glide path' of fiscal consolidation and has reduced it from 3.46 per cent in 2022-23 to 3.45 per cent in 2023-24 to 3.44 per cent in 2024-25.
The fiscal glide path represents the route taken by the Finance Ministry and the government to meet their self-set fiscal targets, crucial to prevent adverse effects of uncontrolled budget deficits on long-term economic growth.

PHDCCI
on Friday said it apprehends ""severe hit"" to
trade and industry
and loss of

in the northern states from a lingering
farmers' agitation
which would result in economic losses of over Rs 500 crore daily. ""A lingering
agitation
will cause Rs 500 crores
economic loss
daily and will have an impact on Q4 Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of northern states majorly Punjab, Haryana and
Delhi
,"" said Sanjeev Agrawal, President, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The industry body looks forward to an early resolution of the issues from both the government and the farmers, with a common consensus for the welfare of all in the country, he added.
Agrawal stated that the
farmers
' agitation is severely impacting the businesses of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan as raw materials of such units are procured largely from other states to execute production processes and to meet up demand of the consumers.
The major hit will be on the MSMEs in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi.
""The combined GSDP of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi is estimated at Rs 27 lakh crore in 2022-23 at current prices. There are around 34 lakh MSMEs in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi which employ about 70 lakh workers in their respective factories,"" said Agrawal.

Besides suggesting tax devolution between the Centre and states and revenue augmentation measures, the commission would review the present arrangements for financing disaster management initiatives with reference to the funds constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
Finance Commission
is a constitutional body that gives suggestions on centre-state financial relations.
The erstwhile 15th Finance Commission under NK Singh had recommended that states be given 41 per cent of the divisible tax pool of the Centre during the five-year period from 2021-22 to 2025-26, which is at the same level as was recommended by 14th Finance Commission under Y V Reddy.

Reserve Bank of India
’s
gold purchases
in the last calendar year fell to their lowest levels since the
central bank
started accumulating the yellow metal in 2017 amid a strong US dollar.
It had added 0.04 million troy ounces of gold in
December
, 2017, when the gold stock had touched 17.94 million troy ounce then.
The central bank’s stock of gold holding in 2023 increased 0.52 million troy ounces (ozt) to 25.84 million ozt by the end of December from 25.32 million ozt a year earlier.
One troy ounce is approximately 31.10 grams.
The
RBI
may have trimmed the purchases like most other central banks amid rising
gold prices
, which help it make mark-to-market valuation gains on its historical stock of yellow metal. The central bank started accumulating gold in small quantities in December 2017 as a part of its strategy to have adiversified portfolio of its foreign ex- change reserves.

“My sense would be that for 2023, the RBI would have not bought a lot of dollars, and given the fall in securities holdings in 2022, it made sense to bring hard currency assets back, since they are remunerative, while for gold you only have to hope for capital appreciation,” said Rahul Bajoria head of EM Asia (ex China) economics research, Barclays Investment Bank.
“We need to know RBI policy on this,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at
Bank of Baroda
. “It is likely the possible allocation (for gold) is in proportion to dollar reserves and with the (gold) price being at high levels it would mean lower tonnage.”
In its halfyear report on forex reserves released in November, the central bank said that as at end-September 2023, it held 800.79 metric tonnes of gold (including gold deposits of 39.89 metric tonnes).
While 388.06 metric tonnes of gold were held overseas in safe custody with the Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), 372.84 metric tonnes of gold were held domestically.
In value terms, the share of gold in the total forex reserves decreased from 7.81% at end-March 2023 to about 7.37% at end-September 2023, it said. As of end December 2023, the share of gold in reserves rose to 7.70%. This is reckoned to be higher than China’s share of gold in reserves, which, according to the World Gold Council, is at 4% in December 2023.
The RBI and People’s Bank of China accounted for one-third of the 1,037 metric tonnes of gold purchased collectively by all central banks in the world in 2023, the council said. The average 2023 gold price of $1,940.54 /oz — also a record — was 8% higher than 2022, it said.
Unlike other central banks, the Reserve Bank of India has never sold its stock of gold to book profits. “While safety and liquidity constitute the twin objectives of reserve management in India, return optimisation is kept in view within this framework,” RBI said in its report.

"Businesses navigate new tax law impacting MSE payments, seek government intervention",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/businesses-navigate-new-tax-law-impacting-mse-payments-seek-government-intervention/articleshow/107607122.cms,12-02-2024,"Many big and small businesses are playing a cat-and-mouse game. Some are taking an aggressive stance, while most are waiting it out, knocking on the government's doors, as a well-meaning, yet unsettling, law aims to move the wheels of commerce faster. Under the law - Section 43B(h) of the
Income Tax Act
- whose impact would be felt for the first time this year, a business entity failing to pay its vendors registered as 'micro' or 'small' (
MSE
) within 45 days of
delivery
, would not get the deduction of its purchase in the year of the purchase but can claim the deduction only in the year of 'actual payment'. Thus, deduction disallowance for unpaid outstandings would increase the
taxable
income and
tax
of companies for FY24.
In grappling with the new statute, companies and vendors are trying to escape its impact in different ways - some of which may not later stand the scrutiny of the auditors and tax office.
Tacit deals with vendors
For instance, many companies are sending registered letters to vendors asking them if they are classified as
MSEs
with a tacit understanding that the latter would not respond. In the absence of a response, the vendor is not considered as a government-registered MSE and the purchases are treated as deductible.
""Some companies are issuing cheques to suppliers and showing the payment in the books with the understanding that the suppliers would deposit the cheques only on the agreed dates. There are those who are raising an objection within 15 days from the delivery of goods, in which case the payment obligation would arise only when the issue is resolved. Large buyers are also telling the micro/small suppliers to surrender the MSME registration which would make the entire
MSMED Act
no more applicable on transactions between them,"" said Manish Dafria, a senior chartered accountant based in Indore.
Live Events
Indeed, a large southern association has advised micro and small enterprises (MSEs) that since it's not possible to pay within 45 days, the suppliers should either cancel their registration or immediately reclassify themselves to ""trading"" from ""manufacturing"" entities as wholesale and retail traders, say many tax practitioners, are not eligible for this benefit. The association has also conveyed that its members are planning to return all goods for which payments cannot be made within 45 days and may stop further purchases from MSEs. It feels that the government should not meddle in to re-define business relationships which are ""based on trust and honour.""
Knocking on g
ovt's door
The law was passed by the government to lessen the plight of small businesses who are paid 60 to 180 days after the delivery of goods and services. ""The law should allow deduction on expenditures as long as payments are made before the filing of the IT returns, which is October 31 for corporates. Today, this is allowed for other items but not for SME payments. The transition to a strict 45-day payment schedule would take time and the impact would be felt the most in the financial year ending March 31, 2024,"" said Gautam Nayak, partner at CNK & Associates, a tax and audit firm. In partially softening the blow to big buyers from the change in the tax law, some vendors are 'voluntarily' giving up their claims on interest applicable for delayed payment. However, some practitioners think this may not work out, thanks to provisions of the MSMED Act. Non-payment to registered MSMEs results in payment of interest which is triple the RBI bank rate.
""But enforcement is not consistently strict. Companies receiving goods/services from MSMEs with payments exceeding 45 days and failing to file MSME-1 to the ministry of corporate affairs face penalties. Suppliers can also file delayed payment claims against buyers, but most MSMEs hesitate due to potential impact on future relationships,"" said Paras Savla, partner at KPB & Associates, a CA firm.
Last week, a leading industry association from Surat met finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to put across the problems generated by the new law. Maharashtra business bodies have made representations to Narayan Rane, the minister of micro, small and medium enterprises. Some of the trade organisations have requested deferring the law by a year and fixing the payment period to at least 60 days.
What has rattled industry is the question mark that the law puts on the way businesses have happened for ages. According to Anurag Poddar, who represents multiple trade associations, ""Ideally, the government should not be laying down the payment terms. These are commercial deals between businesses and vendors. What the law should probably say is that if a MS supplier is not paid within, say, 15 days of the agreed payment period, such expenditure would be disallowed. But 45 days is too short in the Indian environment. After all, even exporters get 180 days to bring in their proceeds...There is a risk that business could shift from MSEs, and thus end up harming rather than benefiting them.""

However, in a verdict last month, the appellate body dismissed Toyota Kirloskar's appeal against the payment of dividend distribution tax (DDT) using the India-Japan Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). The appellate body approved the company's
royalty
payment of ₹646 crore at 6% of local value addition and rejected the transfer pricing officer's estimate of ₹437 crore at 2.62% of net sales. Moreover, it also upheld Toyota Kirloskar's method of combining all its international transactions to determine the arm's length price for the royalty payment.

"Fragile-five days long gone as funds pile into India, Indonesia",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/fragile-five-days-long-gone-as-funds-pile-into-india-indonesia/articleshow/107606537.cms,11-02-2024,"India
and
Indonesia
were once famously lumped together as part of Morgan Stanley’s “Fragile Five.” A decade later they are investor favorites. The outlook for the bonds and currencies of the two Asian behemoths has brightened following successful programs of
reforms
and fiscal restraint, according to
fund managers
including Fidelity International, Robeco Group and abrdn. Even
elections
in the two countries this year are unlikely to spook
investors
.
The original
Fragile Five
— which also included Turkey, South Africa and Brazil — referred to nations perceived to be most at risk due to their heavy reliance on foreign investment to drive growth. Improving finances — as reflected in credit-default swaps — show the market’s view of India and Indonesia has swung almost 180 degrees since the term was coined in 2013.
“Both India and Indonesia have strong near- and long-term fundamentals,” said Kitty Yang, tactical asset allocation analyst for multi asset at Fidelity International in London. “Growth is underpinned by positive (and continuing) reforms over the past 10 years under Prime Minister Modi and President Jokowi.”
Bloomberg
India’s five-year credit default swaps — derivatives used to protect bonds against default — have dropped about 85% from their 2013 peak, reflecting an improvement in the nation’s credit quality. Similar-maturity CDS on Indonesia’s debt has fallen 70% in the same period. In contrast, prices of Turkey’s default swaps have risen.

Overseas investors poured a combined $14 billion into Indian and Indonesian bonds last year, even as global debt markets were sold off on the prospect of higher-for-longer global interest rates. That was the highest joint inflow into the two countries since 2019, and compares with outflows of $3.9 billion in 2013.
‘Long overdue’
India’s bonds have rallied over the past four months on the prospect of global index inclusion, and they extended gains in February after the government surprised the markets by announcing lower-than-estimated debt sales.
The government also said it planned to cut its budget deficit to 5.1% of gross domestic product, below the 5.3% predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey.
“India is long overdue for a
credit rating
upgrade” as reforms have improved its fundamentals and resilience, thus creating some of the best opportunities in
equity
and fixed-income markets, said Kenneth Akintewe, head of Asian sovereign debt at abrdn Asia in Singapore.
Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
, who is standing for re-election in May, referenced the Fragile Five in a speech to parliament this month. During the previous government, “the entire world used words like ‘Fragile Five’ and policy paralysis for India. And in our 10 years - among the Top 5 economies. That is how the world talks about us today,” he said.
The expression “Fragile Five” was coined by Morgan Stanley’s James Lord about a decade ago, identifying the countries as vulnerable economies. Lord is now global head of FX and EM strategy at the bank. A representative from Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
Disciplined Indonesia
Indonesia has also taken great strides in improving its finances.
After temporarily breaching the regulatory fiscal deficit limit of 3% of gross domestic product in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-related spending, the government narrowed the shortfall to 2.38% in 2022, one year earlier than projected. The fiscal gap shrank to 1.65% in 2023, below a revised projection of 2.28% made in July.
Indonesia has been very disciplined with keeping its fiscal deficit below the 3% threshold, with the exception for a couple of years during Covid, said Stephen Chang, a fund manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Hong Kong. “Even with a new administration, we think some of these economic policies will continue.”
Risk factors
An election to appoint a new Indonesian president on Feb. 14 would previously have been a major risk factor for investors, but is currently seen as less of a concern given reforms are so entrenched.
That’s despite the fact that front-runner Prabowo Subianto has campaigned on promises such as free lunches for 83 million beneficiaries, and said he’s comfortable with the nation increasing its debt levels to as much as 50% of gross domestic product.
Markets have also been jittery about the potential resignation of Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati who has been credited with stabilizing the government’s finances.
Sri Mulyani has made the Ministry of Finance “a better place than she found it in both of her terms, and that assists the fundamental investment thesis for Indonesia,” said Philip McNicholas, an Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco Group in Singapore. Still, “it seems unlikely that there would be an evident deterioration in the overall process of the ministry,” he said.
McNicholas said the outlook for both Indonesia and India remains positive.
“Both economies have favorable longer-term economic outlooks. A lot of low-hanging fruit remains, offering scope to enhance growth prospects further.”

"ET Now GBS 2024: India among most attractive foreign investment hotspots, says Gerry Grimstone, chairman, Gemcorp Capital Management",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/et-gbs-2024-india-among-most-attractive-foreign-investment-hotspots-says-gerry-grimstone-chairman-gemcorp-capital-management/articleshow/107588788.cms,10-02-2024,"India
has become one of the most attractive destinations in the world for
foreign investment
, but there is a need to level up those states in the country that have fallen behind, said Lord
Gerry Grimstone
, chairman,
Gemcorp Capital Management
.
The former UK minister for investment said, addressing a session on 'Unlocking Growth through Foreign Investment' on Saturday, that manufacturing has a ""profound"" social and economic impact as it helps re-establish the social hierarchies in towns and cities.
""Extraordinarily, foreign investment has increased 20 times in India in the last 20 years and this hasn't come about by accident and particularly since 2014,"" Grimstone said. Since 2014, there have been government policies such as the impact of the
ease of doing business
, reforms to the tax code to make it transparent, many economic changes and ""a real sea change in the welcoming attitude that India pays to
foreign investors
"", he said.
Emphasising that India has a ""very investor friendly environment"", he said, ""I really do believe that India has now become one of the most attractive destinations in the world for foreign investment. And that has enormous implications going forward.""
As per
Grimstone
, five states in India at the moment attract 90% of foreign direct investment. ""How do we level up states that have fallen behind or weren't so lucky to benefit from this?"" he said. This situation is similar to that in the UK, where there is a huge concentration of economic activity in London, he said. ""We found that foreign investment was vitally important. And we over-incentivised foreign investors to set up investments, particularly manufacturing investments, in those parts of the UK which needed levelling up,"" he said.

Central Board of Trustees
(CBT) of the
Employees' Provident Fund Organisation
(EPFO) is likely to recommend an interest rate of about 8% for
FY24
when it meets on Saturday, people familiar with the matter told ET. The
EPFO
had credited 8.15% interest in FY23 and 8.10% in FY22.
The retirement fund body is also likely to seek the board's approval to substantially increase its
investment
in stocks to 15% from around 10% now to enhance the
return on investments
. ""This being an election year, the government will ensure a sustainable rate of return on provident fund (PF) deposits which is also at par with the existing rates to avoid any backlash,"" said an EPFO board member.
The state-run retirement fund has over 60 million subscribers. The
finance ministry
notifies the final rate of interest after taking the recommended rate into consideration. The EPFO has circulated the agenda for the 235th meeting of the CBT scheduled for February 10 that includes an update on pensions, budgetary estimates and compliance issues.
While the interest rate and equity investment matters are not part of the agenda circulated by the EPFO, the retirement fund body is likely to introduce the two items before the CBT with the permission of its chairman, the labour minister. The investment pattern notified by the finance ministry allows 5-15% of incremental investments in stocks, but the EPFO has to seek the board's approval to enhance its equity exposure.

RBI adds increased functionality to CBDC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-adds-increased-functionality-to-cbdc/articleshow/107519990.cms,08-02-2024,"The
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) is ramping up efforts to roll out its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) by introducing new features to enhance its functionality. As part of the
CBDC
pilot program, the
RBI
is adding programmability and offline functionality to the digital currency.
The CBDC Retail (CBDC-R) pilot currently allows for Person to Person (P2P) and Person to Merchant (P2M) transactions using Digital Rupee wallets provided by selected banks.
Now, the RBI plans to expand its use cases by introducing programmability, which will allow government agencies to ensure payments are made for specific benefits, while letting companies allocate funds for expenses such as business travel.
Also, the RBI is introducing features like validity periods and geographical usage restrictions that can be programmed into the CBDC, said RBI in its statement on developmental and regulatory policies.
In a bid to accommodate areas with poor or limited internet connectivity, the RBI is proposing to introduce offline functionality for CBDC-R transactions. Various offline solutions, both proximity and non-proximity based, will be tested in hilly, rural, and urban locations.
Live Events
Addressing concerns about whether programmability and restrictive usage impact fungibility of the currency, deputy governor T Rabi Sankar said that it is a facility that RBI is providing. He cited an example- if a school gives digital money to a student for buying books from a specific shop, the student can only use it for that purpose. Once the books are purchased, the currency becomes fungible as it transfers to the shop owner. If the books are not bought, the money returns to the school and remains fungible. This limited fungibility only applies during that period, and can be used as a means of controlling expenditure, with both the recipient and the one imposing restrictions agreeing to the facility.
Governor Shaktikanta Das added that at the later date when CBDC is fully implemented, if the government wants to give some cash support for a specific purpose, programmability will be useful in such situations as the money will be used for specific purposes.
These functionalities will be introduced in a phased manner to expand the participation of more banks, users, and locations.
CBDC, also known as Digital Rupee (or e₹), is a digital form of physical currency. The RBI creates tokens and distributes them to selected banks, known as Token Service Providers (TSPs), which then distribute the tokens to interested parties and customers. These digital Rupee tokens will function similarly to physical cash, allowing users to conduct transactions without the need for paper currency.
Currently, the pilot is operational across 13 banks. There were four banks in the first phase of the pilot including State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, and IDFC First Bank. Later Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank, and Kotak Mahindra Bank were included.
The digital currency offers features similar to physical cash, such as trust, safety, and settlement ease. However, like cash, CBDC does not accrue interest and can be converted into other forms of money, such as bank deposits.

NPCI working on ‘Digital Payments Score’ to improve the credit identity of Indians,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/npci-working-on-digital-payments-score-to-improve-the-credit-identity-of-indians/articleshow/107498529.cms,07-02-2024,"The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is working on a ‘
Digital Payments
Score’ from which users will have a
credit
score that will help them in getting
retail credit
, a senior executive said. The
NPCI
will partner with a few lenders and run a pilot to improve the credit identity of Indians soon.
India is an under penetrated market when it comes to retail credit, even when Indian
Fintech
companies are witnessing substantial growth in loan disbursals. In the first quarter of this fiscal, these Fintech companies disbursed a total of 22.2 million loans, growing 30.6% from the previous year, said a report by Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (
FACE
).
“When it comes to retail penetration, even amongst emerging markets like Colombia and South Africa, the number of people who have a credit score is limited. Underserved and unserved population is very high – about 720 million”, said Praveena Rai, COO, NPCI.
Fintechs will be the primary drivers of the Digital Payments Score as this plays out in the next few years. There is a need to balance both utilisation risk and credit risk while eliminating friction. The parameters for how this score will be calculated will evolve through the process, she said.
The need to build a credit identity and create an awareness about credit score is lacking. “In the US, even a student will start using a credit card, because they want to build their credit identity so in the future when they go on to buy a house etc, they have a mature score that is available”, Rai said.

India expects $1.8 billion in dividends from state-run banks in 2024/25: Finance Ministry official,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-expects-1-8-billion-in-dividends-from-state-run-banks-in-2024/25-finance-ministry-official/articleshow/107459831.cms,06-02-2024,"Rising profits at India's
state-run banks
could produce nearly $2 billion in dividends for the government in the next
fiscal year
starting in April, a solid jump from this year, a top
finance ministry
official said.
Since taking charge in 2014, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
has taken steps to strengthen state banks including merging weaker banks with stronger ones and a
bankruptcy law
to recover money from defaulters, while channeling more than Rs 3.3 trillion ($39.7 billion) to recapitalise stressed banks.
The government expects to receive at least Rs 150 billion ($1.8 billion) in dividends from state banks in 2024/25, up 8.7% or more from an expected Rs 138 billion in the current fiscal year ending in March, Vivek Joshi, India's financial services secretary, said late on Monday.
""This is a conservative estimate (about dividends),"" Joshi, told Reuters in a post-budget interview, noting net profits of state banks, including India's largest bank,
State Bank of India
, were set to cross Rs 1 trillion ($12 billion) in the current fiscal year, fuelled by strong credit demand.
The 12 state-run banks have reported net profits totalling Rs 980 billion in three quarters ending December, said Joshi, one of the top officials at the finance ministry.
Live Events
The asset quality of state banks also has improved over the years, with gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) declining to 3.2% in September 2023, from 9.6% in the March 2017 quarter, central bank data showed.
Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
, while presenting the interim budget last week, estimated the government would receive Rs 1.02 trillion ($12.3 billion) in dividends from the Reserve Bank of India, state banks and financial institutions in 2024/25 as against 1.04 trillion in current financial year.
Every year, a large chunk of the dividends comes from the country's central bank. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) transferred Rs 874.16 billion in dividends to the government in the current fiscal year.
State banks have raised Rs 430 billion through markets in the current fiscal year so far, compared to Rs 450 billion in all of the last fiscal year, Joshi said, indicating banks were no more dependent on budgetary support.

India to remain on alert for 'hot money' after bond index inclusion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-to-remain-on-alert-for-hot-money-after-bond-index-inclusion/articleshow/107456223.cms,06-02-2024,"India
will monitor flows of
foreign funds
after its inclusion into
JPMorgan
's emerging market debt index and will take steps to avoid 'hot money' that can trigger volatility in its currency and bond markets, a senior government official said.
""We will keep monitoring it. And when necessary, steps will be taken,""
T.V. Somanathan
, a senior
finance ministry
official told Reuters in an interview.
The aim will be to ""prevent volatility or volatile inflows"" but ""never"" to restrict outflows, he said, adding that ""all possibilities are open to keep volatility in check.
However, any talk about measures right now is ""hypothetical"", said Somanathan.
Last year, JPMorgan announced it will include some Indian bonds in the Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets and its index suite from June, which could lead to incremental inflows of around $23 billion.

Foreign investment in Indian government bonds jumped in the last three months, when investors bought securities worth 446 billion Indian rupees ($5.37 billion).
Somanathan said the government's main concern with index investors was that some of these longer-term investors ""come in passively and leave passively"" and their exit does not always reflect the economic conditions on the ground.
Asked about the government's borrowing, Somanathan said
New Delhi
was likely to raise nearly 200 billion rupees through sovereign green bonds in the 2024/25 fiscal year.
""Within that total borrowing program, some component is likely to be green bonds. Likely to be around the same level as last year but a final decision has not been taken,"" he said.
India issued sovereign green bonds for the first time in the previous financial year.
Last week, the government unexpectedly lowered its gross borrowing target for next financial year to 14.13 trillion rupees ($170.36 billion) and set fiscal deficit aim of 5.1% of gross domestic product.

"Interest rates, borrowing costs in APAC to stay high this year, says Moody’s",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/interest-rates-borrowing-costs-in-apac-to-stay-high-this-year-says-moodys/articleshow/107451748.cms,06-02-2024,"Interest rates
in the
Asia-Pacific region
will remain elevated this year even as moderating
inflation
means that central banks will adopt a slower pace of
monetary tightening
, Moody’s Investor Service said.
“...interest rates are set to remain elevated and decline only gradually for most of the region. We also do not preclude the possibility of occasional rate increases to guard against inflationary pressures,” the rating agency said in a note on Thursday.
With commodity and food prices having declined, Moody’s estimated the median inflation rate in the Asia-Pacific region at 2.6% in 2024, sharply lower than the peak of 5.3% in 2022.
However, given that benchmark policy rates are seen staying above the levels that existed in the last decade,
borrowing costs
will stay elevated, posing a hurdle for economic growth.
“Refinancing and liquidity risks will be highest for frontier markets and high-yield issuers,” Moody’s said.

The silver lining for borrowers, however, is the fact that US interest rates peaked at the end of 2023, with the
Federal Reserve
likely to lower interest rates by the middle of 2024.
India’s central bank has kept interest rates on hold after a cumulative 250 basis points of rate hikes from May 2022 to February 2023.
CHINA WEAKNESS
Amid continued weakness in China’s stock markets, Moody’s said that the decline in the country’s growth trajectory reflected continued emphasis on domestic rebalancing as well as the slowdown in its property sector.
“However, the slowdown in China will be mitigated by robust domestic demand in other large emerging markets in the region, such as Indonesia and India,” the rating firm said.
The weakness in the world’s second-largest economy threatens to spill over in the region through the transmission channels of trade in goods and services, commodity prices and investment.
Economies which have higher services trade exposure to China include Thailand and Cambodia, while those which have higher goods trade exposure include Mongolia and Taiwan, Moody’s said.
While the stress in China’s property market will continue to plague the country’s nonfinancial companies, Moody’s said that its outlook for nonfinancial companies in the rest of Asia-Pacific is stable.
This reflects “robust earnings potential from still-strong economic growth in other large markets, such as India and Indonesia,” the firm said.
However, non-financial companies in the region still face risks from higher funding costs and muted demand in other markets with larger exposures to China, such as Japan, Singapore, and Australia.

government
on Monday sought parliamentary approval for an extra net expenditure of ₹78,673 crore in the second and final batch of supplementary demands for grants for 2023-24, on top of the ₹58,378 crore additional spending approved in the first batch in December last year.
Despite the additional expenditure, the government expects to rein in its fiscal deficit for this financial year at 5.8% of gross domestic product, bettering the 5.9% budgeted goal, as revenue mop-up is estimated to breach the initial projections, according to the
interim budget
for 2024-25.
The latest set of demands involves gross additional spending of more than ₹2 lakh crore in this fiscal. However, nearly ₹1.22 lakh crore of it will be met through savings or enhanced receipts of various ministries and departments, showed the papers tabled in Parliament.
The government had budgeted total expenditure of ₹45 lakh crore for 2023-24, while its tax and non-tax revenue was pegged at ₹26.3 lakh crore. However, the interim budget revised the expenditure estimate to ₹44.9 lakh crore, in the wake of an expected drop in capex from the budgeted level, and tax and non-tax revenue to ₹27 lakh crore.

The latest supplementary demands comprise a total of 71 grants and one appropriation.
The net outgo under the two batches of supplementary demands for grants in 2023-24 is way below the level a year before, when the government had sought clearance for a net spending of ₹4.74 lakh crore. However, this was because the Ukraine war broke out unexpectedly, leading to elevated global commodity prices that inflated the government's subsidy bill in 2022-23.
J&K interim budget for 2024-25
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday presented an interim budget of almost ₹1.19 lakh crore for 2024-25 for the Union territory of Jammu & Kashmir, up 9.7% from the revised estimate (RE) for 2023-24.
Revenue spending in the next fiscal is pegged at ₹80,162 crore, up 5.3% from 2023-24 (RE), while capital spending will see a 20.4% jump to ₹38,566 crore. The interim budget estimated a fiscal deficit of ₹20,760 crore in 2024-25, down from ₹23, 542 crore in 2023-24 (RE). It also projected a 7.5% expansion in the gross state domestic product next fiscal.
""The government is maintaining law and order to ensure security while simultaneously implementing initiatives for economic and social development. The government has adopted a policy of zero tolerance against terrorism,"" Sitharaman said.

Talking about the benefits of large outlay on capital expenditure, Seth said, it has a multiplier effect on the economy, attracts private investment and generates jobs for factory workers, skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled persons.
The government in the Interim Budget 2024-25 has hiked capital expenditure (capex) by 11.1 per cent to Rs 11.11 lakh crore for the next financial year from Rs 9.5 lakh crore estimated for the current financial year.
Infra-spending has a multiplier effect on the economy. This means that not only does the project contribute immediately through increased demand for labour and construction materials but also through the second-order effects in terms of improved connectivity.
Various studies have estimated the multiplier to be between 2.5-and 3.5 times. So for every rupee spent by the government in creating infrastructure, GDP gains are worth Rs 2.5-3.5.
According to NITI Aayog, in times of economic contraction, this multiplier is larger than the one during economic expansion. This implies that public investment, if timed and targeted right, can actually 'crowd-in' private investment rather than 'crowd-out' such funds.

Paytm Payments Bank: The controversies and challenges ahead for India's fintech poster boy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/explainer-paytm-payments-bank-meltdown-its-meaning/articleshow/107402188.cms,04-02-2024,"Son of a schoolteacher from Aligarh district in Uttar Pradesh,
Vijay Shekhar Sharma
was enamoured by Jack Ma-run Alibaba's focus on smartphones rather than desktop computers, when he built a digital payments company that would let Indians pay for vegetables, pay utility bills or buy cinema tickets using their mobile phones. Sharma, the poster boy of India's fintech boom, also set out to build an Alipay-like mobile marketplace to go alongside the payments business, allowing businesses to sell goods from matchbox to iPhones online.
With fame came a set of controversies for arguably the most high-profile of a wave of Indian tech entrepreneurs.
But none like the one now. The current crisis where the Reserve Bank has ordered
Paytm Payments Bank
to halt most of its business, is an existential one.

The regulator last week ordered Paytm Payments Bank Ltd, a restricted bank that can take deposits but cannot lend, to not take any further deposits or conduct credit transactions or carry out top-ups on any customers accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, cards for paying road tolls after February 29.
Paytm wallet customers can use money till the time their balance is exhausted. They cannot add money after February 29. And in case RBI does not relent, top-up for Paytm wallet will stop and transactions through it would no longer can be carried.
So what is Paytm Payments Bank, and who owns it?
Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) is an associate of One97 Communications Limited (OCL). One97 Communications holds 49 per cent of the paid-up share capital (directly and through its subsidiary) of PPBL. Vijay Shekhar Sharma has a 51 per cent stake in the bank.
PPBL commenced operations as a payments bank with effect from May 23, 2017. Paytm Payments Bank offered digital banking, including savings accounts, current accounts, fixed deposits with partner banks, and balance in wallets, UPI, and FASTag, among other services.
Paytm Wallet, which comes under PPBL, leads the segment. As per RBI's provisional data for December 2023, Paytm Wallet users carried out 24.72 crore transactions worth over Rs 8,000 crore for purchase of goods and services while 2.07 crore transactions were carried out for transferring over Rs 5,900 crore.
What happened and what it means for customers?
The RBI on January 31 directed the Paytm Payments Bank to stop accepting deposits or top-ups in customer accounts, wallets, FASTags and other instruments after February 29. Withdrawal or utilisation of balances by its customers from their accounts, including savings bank accounts, current accounts, prepaid instruments, FASTags, National Common Mobility Cards, are to be permitted without any restrictions, up to their available balance.
Paytm Wallet users can continue to carry on transactions till February 29. However, after February 29, they will be able to use their existing balance till the time it is exhausted but not add any money to their account.
The same rule is applicable on PPBL accounts, Paytm wallet linked services like FASTag, National Common Mobility Card that are used for travel in metro and other public transport.
What are the alternatives for users?
There are over 20 banks and non-banking entities that offer wallet service. The leading one after PPBL wallet includes Mobikwik, PhonePe, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Amazon Pay etc.
Similarly, there are 37 banks comprising all the known public and private sector banks like SBI, HDFC, ICICI, IDFC, Airtel Payments Bank which are authorised to provide FASTag. Customers can recharge FASTag online using their banks mobile banking, internet banking or third party apps like Google Pay, PhonePe etc.
Why did Paytm Payments Bank come under RBI lens?
The banking regulator had been frequently flagging off issues.
According to sources, money laundering concerns and questionable dealings of hundreds of crores of rupees between popular wallet Paytm and its lesser-known banking arm had led Reserve Bank of India to clamp down on Vijay Shekhar Sharma-run entities.
Sources further said that PPBL had lakhs of non-KYC (Know Your Customer) compliant accounts and in thousands of cases single PANs were used for opening multiple accounts. There were instances of the total value of transactions -- running into crores of rupees, much beyond regulatory limits in minimum KYC pre-paid instruments raising money laundering concerns, sources said.
What has been the company's response to the RBI's Jan 31 action?
While users have the option to switch to other wallets, and FASTag services etc being provided by other vendors, Paytm management has said that PPBL is in discussion with RBI to comply with their direction for continuing the business.
Paytm has said that its financial services such as loan distribution, insurance distribution and equity broking are not in any way related to PPBL and are expected to be unaffected. The company's offline merchant payment network offerings like Paytm QR, Paytm Soundbox, Paytm Card Machine will continue as usual, where it can onboard new offline merchants as well.
Paytm sees an impact of Rs 300-500 crore on its annual operational profit.
How has One97 Communications' shares responded?
Following the RBI's crackdown, shares of One97 Communications Ltd, which owns Paytm brand, slumped 40 per cent in the last two days. The stock tanked 20 per cent to Rs 487.05, its lowest trading permissible limit for the day, on the BSE on Friday.
In two days, the company's market capitalisation (mcap) eroded by Rs 17,378.41 crore to Rs 30,931.59 crore.

"Focus to be on concluding ongoing strategic sales in FY'25, says DIPAM Secretary",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/focus-to-be-on-concluding-ongoing-strategic-sales-in-fy25-says-dipam-secretary/articleshow/107397737.cms,04-02-2024,"The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) will focus on concluding the ongoing privatisation transactions, like
IDBI Bank
and BEML, and may not look at any new CPSE for a strategic sale in the next fiscal, a senior official said. DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey in an interview to PTI said that no specific company is there in the list for
Initial Public Offering
(IPO) for next fiscal, but there would be share sale offers from subsidiaries of listed CPSEs.
Pandey said the combined market capitalisation of central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), banks and insurance companies has grown 500 per cent in past three years from Rs 15 lakh crore to Rs 58 lakh crore.
Also, Government of India's equity holding has risen 4 times to Rs 38 lakh crore, from Rs 9.5 lakh crore in January 2021.
""There has been a huge value creation in public sector enterprises which has been due to robust performance, growth prospects, capital restructuring, consistent dividend policy as well as a calibrated disinvestment strategy, amid a positive Indian economy context,"" Pandey said.
DIPAM, which manages government equity in public sector companies, is also working on privatisation of CPSEs where preliminary Expressions of Interest (EoIs) has been received from prospective bidders.

Pandey said the companies where EoIs have been issued and where initial bidder interest has already come in, those will be pursued in next fiscal.
""We are not looking at any further things at the moment. We are focusing on conclusion which we initially thought would be completed in this financial year but there is a spillover for some of the reason which is extraneous to us, we would like to follow up more effectively and go for culmination of those transactions,"" Pandey said.
Strategic sale of a host of CPSEs, including
Shipping Corporation
,
NMDC Steel
, BEML and HLL Lifecare, besides IDBI Bank are in the pipeline and were targeted for completion this fiscal.
With regard to government stake dilution in
Hindustan Zinc
(HZL), Pandey said the plans for selling stake in tranches are facing uncertainties with respect to demerger plans of the management.
Last year too, Anil Agarwal-owned
Vedanta
had planned to sell its global zinc assets to HZL, a move which analysts saw as an attempt to tap into the erstwhile state owned firm's huge cash pile. The government, which has a directorial position on HZL board, opposed the move over valuation concerns.
Agarwal-owned HZL now plans to demerge the company into three separate entities.
""We had setbacks there. Initially our intent was to exit in tranches and going to the market as per order of
Supreme Court
, but subsequently we had setbacks because of the certain decisions taken by the promoter and management which was not consistent with our objective, like related party transaction. Now there are more uncertainties around demerger. The
Ministry of Mines
is closely examining all those issues and until these uncertainties are resolved, investors are not going to be interested in the stock and forthcoming in our share sale,"" Pandey said.
Promoter Vedanta
group owns 64.92 per cent equity in HZL, while the government holds 29.54 per cent. The remaining around 5 per cent stake is with public shareholders.
In the interim budget 2024-25, the government has targeted to raise Rs 50,000 crore from other capital receipts which include proceeds from disinvestment and asset monetisation.

interim budget
has proposed withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands if the amount is up to ₹25,000 a year till fiscal 2010 and up to ₹10,000 between fiscal 2010 and 2014. But a taxpayer can seek the withdrawal of tax notices for more than one year with a total cap of ₹1 lakh, revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra tells Anuradha Shukla and Deepshikha Sikarwar. Edited excerpts:
The finance minister has announced withdrawal of past demands up to fiscal 2014. Will there be certain conditions attached and by when would it be operationalised?
This will take about two months. The details are being worked out. The only condition is the relief to a single taxpayer will not exceed ₹1 lakh. If an individual demand amount is limited to ₹25,000, the taxpayer can have more than one demand. But the total amount that will be withdrawn per individual will not exceed a lakh.
Will this apply even in search cases?
This will apply to all.
FM has spoken about taxpayer services in her speech? What could be next on the table for taxpayer services?
Live Events
Improving taxpayer services is something which has been the focus of the government for the last five years and shall continue to be so. It is a continuing agenda because there is much to be done. Trust, technology, tax certainty, tax simplification and rationalisation are going to be the core pillars on which we propose to improve taxpayer service.
What are you alluding to in respect of simplification and rationalisation?
I am not alluding to anything specific. There will be various measures as and when they are required. This is only an interim budget. The main
budget
will be in July and then things can happen, even outside the budget. We keep getting suggestions from various quarters. For example, look at indirect taxes. We reduced customs duty on most of the parts for mobile phones to 10% from 15% as there was a need felt in the interest of simplification and to avoid disputes. There were interpretational issues, so now those were done outside the budget.
The intent of the government is always to keep things simple. But in the process, sometimes things happen inadvertently that do not pan out as expected. So that remains to be a focus area. There are some grievances on the technology side in direct taxes. There are some tax demands that are because of technical errors in the IT system. Similarly, how we can improve our risk assessment with use of better artificial intelligence, better machine learning and new technologies so that we are able to pinpoint more correctly those who have avoided or evaded the taxes. Use of technology for improving taxpayer services as well as for better enforcement is very much part of our agenda.
There was an expectation that the 15% rate for manufacturing companies would be extended...
Manufacturing investments take a long time to fructify. That is why in 2019, a four-year window was given and then extended because of Covid. It was not extended last year but before that. So sufficient time had already been given. And we have seen the benefits thereof. Some companies have started coming in and they have used this particular taxation provision; they will get the benefits thereof. Even otherwise, corporate tax rates are very reasonable now at 22%, if one compares globally.
So, this is off the table.
Certainly. This is something which is behind us.
There is a gradual decline in customs and excise duty estimates. Any specific reason for this?
Overall, trade is down globally. In our country, it is up in rupee terms but down in dollar terms. So, in customs we are having a growth rate of only about 2%. That is why there is a downward projection. Similarly, in excise as we stand till December, there is a 5% decrease. The decrease is primarily because of two reasons. There was a duty cut so there is a base effect. Also, the windfall tax is much less, roughly about 50% less than last year, which was ₹25,000-26,000 crore. As a result, we have reduced the revised estimate compared to budget estimates.
There was a lot of discussion around simplifying capital gains. Is that off the table?
As I said, rationalisation and simplification is an ongoing exercise. If there is a need or people see that there is a need for rationalisation, or if it needs to be simplified, then certainly the government takes cognisance of such demands and takes appropriate decisions at an appropriate time.
Companies were expecting clarity on Pillar 2 (rules under the Global Anti-Base Erosion model)...
This is an interim budget. Clarity will be provided in the main budget. We have set up a committee and they are looking into it.

DIPAM
Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey on Friday said the Rs 30,000 crore
capital receipts
target set in the Revised Estimates for the current fiscal include about Rs 20,000 crore from CPSE
disinvestment
and the remaining from
asset monetisation
. Pandey, in an interview with PTI, said the government has reworked the heading of non-debt capital receipts provided in the
Budget
document. Non-debt capital receipts include
loans and advances
and other capital receipts, as against earlier classification of loans and advances, disinvestment and asset monetisation.
The government has budgeted Rs 30,000 crore from other capital receipts in the Revised Estimates for the current fiscal. For 2024-25, the amount is budgeted at Rs 50,000 crore.
Pandey said the Budget does not have any specific target for disinvestment for the next fiscal and the Rs 50,000 crore receipts is estimated to come from disinvestment and asset monetisation, as well as capital receipts, which are not classified elsewhere.
About the amount estimated to accrue from monetisation of assets of the central government in the current fiscal, Pandey said, ""We have estimated Rs 10,000-12,000 crore in asset monetisation and Rs 18,000-20,000 crore from disinvestment in the Rs 30,000 crore RE.""
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) secretary also said the government expects to complete the strategic sale of IDBI Bank in the next financial year.
Live Events
He said the process of privatisation of IDBI Bank is on and once the regulator clearance is obtained, financial bids will be invited.
Asked if the strategic sale will be completed in the next fiscal, Pandey said, ""Yes, of course"".
The government, along with LIC, is selling nearly 61 per cent stake in IDBI Bank and had in October 2022, invited bids from buyers.
In January 2023, DIPAM said it had received multiple Expressions of Interest (EoI) for buying a stake in IDBI Bank.
The bidders who have shown interest through EoI have to get two sets of clearances -- one from the home ministry for
security
clearance and the other from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for meeting the 'fit and proper' criteria.

Monthly GST mop-up from online gaming companies jump 400 pc since October 1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/monthly-gst-mop-up-from-online-gaming-companies-jump-400-pc-since-october-1/articleshow/107366341.cms,02-02-2024,"Monthly
GST collections
from
online gaming companies
have jumped over 400 per cent to about Rs 1,200 crore since
October 1
when the 28 per cent levy on
e-gaming platforms
has come into effect, a senior official said on Friday. The GST Council had in August last year clarified that online gaming companies will have to pay 28 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the full face value of bets placed on their platforms. Foreign e-gaming companies were mandated to register with the GST authorities, failing which their portals will be blocked.
The amendments to GST law came into effect from October 1, 2023.
""There has been a jump in GST revenues from online gaming companies post October 1. From monthly
revenue
of Rs 225 crore, the aggregate tax paid by the sector now stands at about Rs 1,200 crore,"" the official told PTI.
GST officers had last year sent around 71 show cause notices to online gaming companies for alleged GST evasion of over Rs 1.12 lakh crore during financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24.
However, no overseas online gaming company has registered in the country since October 2023.

""These overseas companies keep changing their VPNs and change their websites when they are blocked. It is a challenge that the tax officers are facing,"" the official added.
The spate of notices to online gaming companies follows the GST Council's clarification in August that 28 per cent tax would be levied on full value of bets placed on online gaming platforms.
GST Council is chaired by the Union finance minister and comprises finance ministers from all states and Union Territories.
Online gaming companies have been approaching High Courts against such GST demands contesting the claims of revenue authorities. These companies claim they were paying taxes at the rate of 18 per cent as games played on their platforms were 'games of skill'.

Fiscal deficit target of 5.1 per cent ambitious but achievable: Finance Secretary,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/fiscal-deficit-target-of-5-1-per-cent-ambitious-but-achievable-finance-secretary/articleshow/107363845.cms,02-02-2024,"Finance Secretary
T V Somanathan has said the government's resolve to bring down the
fiscal deficit
by 70 basis points to 5.1 per cent in 2024-25 is ambitious but achievable in view of the tax buoyancy and
expenditure management
. Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
in the
interim Budget
presented on Thursday refrained from announcing any populist measures but significantly trimmed the fiscal deficit to 5.1 per cent of the
Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) next fiscal and 4.5 per cent in FY26.
""So it is ambitious but it is also realistic. There are three pillars on which this is based. One is we have assumed growth in tax revenue about 11.5 per cent. I think that's a very realistic assumption,"" Somanathan told PTI Videos in an interview.
Besides, he said, the government has projected a slight increase in non-tax revenue from a high base during the current financial year.
On the expenditure side, he said, ""Capex has increased 11.1 per cent... the revenue expenditure we believe is realistically projected. We have been helped by the fact that some of our subsidies have not grown and whether it is food or fertiliser. Both of them are either stagnant or slightly declined. Fertilizer is assisted by decline in commodity prices globally.""
The government has projected the fertiliser subsidy of Rs 1.64 lakh crore for the next financial year as against Rs 1.88 lakh crore allocated for the current fiscal. Similarly, food subsidy outgo will come down to Rs 2.05 lakh crore compared to Rs 2.12 lakh crore for the current fiscal.

""On the basis of three parts, reasonable revenue growth and reasonable increase in non-tax revenue that is tight control over avoidable expenditure and an optimal balanced increase in capital expenditure we are quite confident that we will achieve this (fiscal deficit target of 5.1 per cent of GDP),"" he said.
In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit would be Rs 16,85,494 crore against Rs 17,34,773 crore for the current fiscal.
For the Budget calculation purposes, the government projected nominal GDP growth of 10.5 per cent for the next financial year against the 11 per cent estimated for the current fiscal.
The nominal GDP for BE 2024-25 has been projected at Rs 3,27,71,808 crore, assuming 10.5 per cent growth over the estimated nominal GDP of Rs 2,96,57,745 crore, as per the First Advance Estimates of FY24.
To meet the fiscal deficit, the gap between revenue receipt and expenditure, the government raises funds by issuing bonds in the market.
The gross and net market borrowings through dated securities during 2024-25 are estimated at Rs 14.13 lakh and Rs 11.75 lakh crore, respectively.
Dismissing criticism on capital expenditure (capex), Somanathan said, ""There is an increase of 11.1 per cent over a very high base. So this is an increase of more than Rs 1 lakh crore... Earlier, we had a small base but now we have a large base so it can only be a small increment.""
Capital expenditure of Rs 11.11 lakh crore cannot be done by signing a cheque, he said, adding that it requires action on the ground because there are issues of permission, land acquisition, and construction.
""So it is a very realistic and balanced provision, which is what the economy needs right now,"" he said.

I-T dept will erase petty tax demands on its own: CBDT chairman on Budget announcement,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/i-t-dept-will-erase-petty-tax-demands-on-its-own-cbdt-chairman-on-budget-announcement/articleshow/107363812.cms,02-02-2024,"The income tax department will ""erase"" petty
tax demands
pending against about 80 lakh taxpayers on its own and issue a ""speaking order"" explaining the process to be followed, CBDT chairman Nitin Gupta said Friday, a day after the measure was proposed in the
interim Budget
. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on Thursday declared the government's proposal to withdraw outstanding
direct tax
demands up to Rs 25,000 till 2009-10 fiscal and up to Rs 10,000 for financial years 2010-11 to 2014-15.
This was being done, she said, as part of an effort to improve ease of living and ease of doing business for citizens. The finance minister added that there were ""a large number"" of petty, non-verified, non-reconciled or disputed direct tax demands, many of them dating as far back as the year 1962, which continue to remain on the books, causing anxiety to honest taxpayers and hindering refunds of subsequent years.
""We will erase these demands, we will extinguish such a demand from the records of the tax department. The taxpayer does not have to do anything and we will not be getting in touch with them (taxpayer) at all.""
""This process will not be adverse to the assessee,"" Gupta told PTI in a post-Budget interview.
However, he said, such demands will be put on the e-filing portal of the individual taxpayers so that they can also have a look and if there is any issue, the department will resolve it, the top tax department officer said.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is the administrative authority for the I-T department.
Gupta added, ""If the taxpayer has an issue with regard to these demand cases like rectification or there could be a case where appeal effect has not been given or a refund issue is pending, then it will be taken care of.""
""We will come out with a speaking order that will explain everything...,"" he said.
About 80 lakh taxpayers will benefit from this measure and the amount involved here is about Rs 3,500 crore, the CBDT chief said.
He said only the base figure of the demand (Rs 25,000 and Rs 10,000) will be the ""deciding factor"" for such cases and not the interest amount riding on the basic demand over the years.
""This is basically a measure to give relief to the taxpayers where there were mismatches...like the taxpayer claiming that he has paid the tax but we (I-T department) don't have the records and even the taxpayer may not have the records and hence grievances came up,"" Gupta said.
Due to this, the entire process of issuing refunds is getting slowed down.
The income tax department is a very old organisation and earlier the processes were paper-based and gradually it embraced technology and hence issues came up when the records were being digitised, he said.
""The government has now taken a call that smaller demands can be extinguished so that these do not come up on a recurring basis and affect our entire process. This way we are also able to clean up our books and this decision is in that direction,"" Gupta said.
Talking about another measure brought in by the department to fasten the issuance of refunds, the CBDT chairman said it has been decided to send the refund in the second-mentioned bank account of a taxpayer in certain held up cases where the first bank account is not working.
The I-T department, as of October last year, has been working on about 35 lakh cases were refunds were held up due to a variety of issues like mismatch in taxpayers' vital details or missing validation of their bank accounts.
The department has made good progress in this regard since October and these numbers have ""shrunk significantly"", Gupta said.
What the department is doing in these cases now is that if a taxpayer's primary bank account is not responding or even if the taxpayer is not responding, it will utilise the second bank account that is provided by the taxpayer in their ITR to issue the refund. The department has ""tweaked"" the system to issue refund to the second bank account, Gupta said.
Asked about the response of taxpayers to the new tax filing regime, Gupta said that while the correct figures in this context will only be known by July 31 of this year, the department estimates that ""at least 60 per cent"" of the individual filers should be switching over to the new regime because of benefits like broader slabs, lower tax rates and even reduced surcharge.
Under the new tax regime, no deductions will be allowed to an individual and they will be offered a flat rate of tax under different applicable slabs.

income tax department
has garnered about Rs 4,600 crore in
taxes
from 56 lakh updated I-T returns filed by taxpayers in the past two years,
Central Board of Direct Taxes
(
CBDT
) chief Nitin Gupta said. In a post budget interview to PTI TV, Gupta also said the I-T department has set up a demand management centre at Mysuru, Karnataka, which is focusing on disputed pending large tax demands of above Rs 1 crore.
""We are continuously improving the services and creating litigation free environment. We have come out with a facility for updation of return. 56 lakh updated returns updated and garnered around Rs 4,600 crore taxes from that,"" Gupta said.
The Interim Budget 2024-25 has announced withdrawal of outstanding small tax demands, some even dating back to 1962, of up to Rs 25,000 till 2014-15 in respect of income, wealth and gift taxes. There are about 1.11 crore such disputed demand entries and the aggregate tax demand involved is Rs 3,500-3,600 crore.
Gupta said the move would benefit about 80 lakh unique taxpayers.
""Small tax demand we are tackling in that (withdrawal of demands) manner and large tax demand we are tackling separately (through demand management centre). We think this exercise would yield quite a lot of dividend to us and we will be able to manage the demand in a more meaningful way,"" Gupta said.

With regard to withdrawal of disputed demands which is announced in Budget, Gupta said most of these demands are on the books.
There could be cases where the taxpayer has already paid the tax demand but it has not been updated on the system because it's an old demand when everything was manual. Some of the demand could be fictitious as well in that sense, because it is already been paid or not payable by taxpayer but no one has record of this, Gupta explained.
""So to do away with all these and reduce grievances of taxpayers, this is a step we have taken. We believe that a number of entries of that nature what the Finance Minister has spoken about in budget speech could be a crore or more of the number of entries and number of taxpayers could be 80 lakh or so unique ones,"" he said, adding with this exercise the department can clean its books and it would be beneficial for taxpayers as well.
""The amount Rs 3,500 crore (which is being withdrawn) would be insignificant compared to what we are collecting annually Rs 19.45 lakh crore. This is the right time to do exercise on that front as well and focus on collection of big demand. The manpower is limited and the effort that we will put in to recover or rectify would be much more than the benefit,"" Gupta said.
The budget 2022-23 had announced a scheme for filing updated returns in ITR-U form. The form can be filed within 2 years of the end of the relevant assessment year, and taxpayers will have to give reasons for updating the income -- return previously not filed or income not reported correctly or wrong heads of income chosen or reduction of carried forward loss.

As of the close of business on January 31, 2024, the total value of ₹2000 banknotes in circulation has declined significantly from ₹3.56 lakh crore at the time of the withdrawal announcement to ₹8,897 crore. This represents a return of 97.50% of the ₹2000 banknotes in circulation as of May 19, 2023.
Legal Tender
Status
Despite the withdrawal, it's important to note that ₹2000 banknotes continue to be legal tender.
According to the RBI, ""97.26 per cent of the ₹2000 banknotes that were circulated in the economy till May 19, 2023, have been returned."" This indicates a substantial return of the withdrawn banknotes.
Extended Deposit Opportunity
Initially, banks allowed the deposit and/or exchange of ₹2000 banknotes up to September 30, 2023. However, recognizing the need for additional time, this deadline was extended to October 7, 2023.
Clean Note Policy
The withdrawal of the ₹2000 denomination banknotes is part of the ""Clean Note Policy"" initiated on May 19, with the aim of maintaining the integrity of the currency in circulation. The public was urged to deposit these banknotes to facilitate the transition.
Background on ₹2000 Banknote
Introduced in November 2016, the ₹2000 denomination banknote served the purpose of meeting the currency requirement of the economy promptly after the withdrawal of the legal tender status of ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes. Over time, the total value of these banknotes in circulation declined from ₹6.73 lakh crore at its peak on March 31, 2018, to ₹3.62 lakh crore, constituting only 10.8% of banknotes in circulation on March 31, 2023.
The latest data from the RBI indicates substantial progress in the withdrawal of ₹2000 banknotes from circulation. With 97.50% of the withdrawn banknotes already returned, the central bank continues its efforts to manage the transition smoothly.
The extension of the deposit deadline and the continued acceptance of these banknotes at RBI Issue Offices demonstrate the commitment to facilitating a seamless process for the public.

8. Sri Lanka: Rs 60 crore

10. Mongolia: Rs 5 crore
Finance Minister today presented the Interim Budget in Parliament. It is important to note that this is a vote-on-account, and the complete budget is expected to be announced in July after the new government assumes office. During her sixth consecutive budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the emergence of a new world order amidst the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, conflicts, and geopolitical shifts.
She stated that globalization is being redefined with reshoring and friend-shoring, disruption and fragmentation of supply chains, and competition for critical minerals and technologies. Sitharaman also showcased India's achievements, including assuming the G20 Presidency during a challenging period for the global economy. She emphasized the prevalent global issues such as high inflation, interest rates, low growth, soaring public debt, sluggish trade growth, and climate challenges. Despite these challenges, India has successfully navigated the crisis, providing leadership and building consensus on global problem-solving.

The government revised
direct tax
collection aim to Rs. 19.45 lakh crore for the current financial year, higher than Rs 16.61 lakh crore collected in fiscal 2023 and Rs 14.08 lakh crore in fiscal 2022. India's net direct tax collections, comprising corporation tax and personal income tax, hit Rs 14.70 lakh crore as of January 11, up 19% from comparable year-earlier period and over 81% of the
budget
estimate.
The government revised the
indirect tax
collection for this fiscal year to Rs 14.92 lakh crore. In FY23 and FY22, indirect tax collections stood at Rs 13.94 lakh crore and Rs 12.94 lakh crore, respectively.

New Delhi set a target of raising Rs 10.67 lakh crore from Goods and Services Tax, up from aim of Rs 9.57 lakh crore for this fiscal year.
India’s GST collection has seen a robust trend this year and crossed Rs 1.60 lakh crore monthly revenue mark for the seventh time in December in this fiscal year. The gross GST collection for the FY24 ending December 2023 of Rs 14.97 lakh crore was 12% higher than the gross GST collection for FY23 ending December 2022.
Excise duty receipts are budgeted to be Rs 3.23 lakh crore for FY25, up from downwardly revised Rs 3.08 lakh crore seen this year.
While Sitharaman praised the taxpayers and the revenue collected from them to be crucial for India's economic growth, she left income and corporate tax slabs unchanged.
“As for tax proposals, in keeping with the convention, I do not propose to make any changes relating to taxation and propose to retain the same tax rates for direct taxes and indirect taxes including import duties,” Sitharaman said while presenting the
interim Budget
for the next fiscal year.

Higher tax kitty for the next fiscal year will provide the government a much-needed shot in the arm to stick to the fiscal glide path, crucial for its pitch to rating agencies for a promotion in sovereign rating. The higher tax collection will also help the government channelise funds to subsidies and other welfare schemes, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to return to power for a third term after the Lok Sabha elections in April to May.
The increased direct tax aim suggests likely higher earnings by corporates and tax-paying individuals in a fast-growing economy that, however, faces inflationary and geopolitical challenges.
Check the key takeaways from Modi 2.0's last finance bill
While a K-shaped economic recovery in India is seen to be a strong trend, according to several economists, the economy has also beaten almost all countries in terms of rising wealth, according to a Credit Suisse-UBS report. Richer India has also helped in tax collections and is likely to add more to the tax coffers with predictions of higher ultra HNIs and billionaire population.
Economists had earlier predicted tax revenues to remain buoyant in FY25, beating nominal GDP growth (11.9% gross tax revenue growth vs 10.6% nominal GDP growth).

Budget 2024: Food subsidy bill at Rs 2.05 trillion for FY25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/budget-2024-food-subsidy-bill-at-rs-2-05-trillion-for-fy25/articleshow/107321972.cms,01-02-2024,"The Central government is estimating the
food subsidy bill
for FY25 at Rs 2.05 lakh crore, down from Rs 2.12 lakh crore in the current financial year, Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said on Thursday.
The food subsidy bill was Rs 2.72 lakh crore in 2022-23.
In her
Budget
Speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stressed that the worries about food have been eliminated through free rations for 80 crore people. ""Minimum support prices for the produce of ‘Annadata' are periodically increased appropriately,"" she added.
The Food Corporation of India (FCI) and states receive subsidies for procuring food grains from farmers at government-notified prices. The grains are then sold at lower subsidised prices under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. The NFSA stipulates coverage for up to 75 per cent of the population in rural areas and 50 per cent in urban areas.
Before the
Union Budget
was announced, reports suggested that the Central government was set to allocate Rs 4 lakh crore for food and fertiliser subsidies in the fiscal year 2025.

Govt allocates Rs 1.64 lk cr towards fertiliser subsidy for FY25 in Budget, 13% lower YoY
The food subsidy forms the largestchunk of the overall expenditure by the Department of Food and Public Distribution, with around 96 per cent allotted towards the bill by the department in FY24. These subsidies constitute approximately one-ninth of India's total budget expenditure of Rs 45 lakh crore for the current financial year ending on March 31.
An analysis of Budget documents shows that the government had budgeted Rs 2.07 lakh crore towards food subsidy for FY23, which was eventually revised to Rs 2.87 lakh crore. The government budgeted Rs 1.97 lakh crore towards food subsidy in FY24, down 31.3 per cent from the revised FY23 estimates. The government’s food subsidy spend has remained contained below Rs 1 lakh crore in the first half of the year, 15 per cent lower than the previous year.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi prior to the assembly elections in late 2023 announced the extension of its flagship free food welfare scheme for the next five years. This scheme was originally announced during the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysts expect this move to impact India's overall food subsidy bill in the coming years. Given the significant percentage the ex-chequer spends towards fertiliser and food subsidies, keeping it in control is essential for the government, given the target to bring down India's fiscal deficit to 4.5 per cent by FY26.
“The near-term fiscal and inflation impact of the free foodgrain scheme is manageable. The need for subsidised grains for lower income households is also undeniable. However, once announced, free schemes are always difficult to roll back and can lead to competitive populism,” research firm Nomura said in a note post the announcement of the extension of the scheme. It may be noted that when it comes to food subsidies in India, critics have flagged its insufficient coverage and instances of leakages.

"India Budget: New Delhi to borrow Rs 14.13 lakh crore in FY25, bond yields plunge",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-budget-new-delhi-to-borrow-14-13-lakh-crore-rupees-in-fy25-bond-yields-plunge/articleshow/107319999.cms,01-02-2024,"Finance Minister Nirmala
Sitharaman
announced that the Indian government is set to borrow a gross amount of Rs 14.13 lakh crore in the fiscal year beginning April 1, a sharp fall from from the current fiscal's estimated borrowing of Rs 15.43 lakh crore. Net borrowings for the upcoming financial year are estimated at Rs 11.75 lakh crore.
The gross borrowing figure is lower than the anticipated Rs 15.6 lakh crore as per economists' estimates in a Reuters poll. Following this announcement, India's 10-year benchmark yield experienced an eight basis points drop to 7.0511%, reacting to the unexpectedly lower borrowing target.
""The gross and net market borrowings through dated securities during 2024-25 are estimated at Rs 14.13 lakh crore and Rs 11.75 lakh crore respectively. Both will be less than that in 2023-24. Now that the private investments are happening at scale, the lower borrowings by the Central Government will facilitate larger availability of credit for the private sector,"" the Finance Minister said in her
Budget
speech.
The borrowed funds are intended to finance a fiscal deficit projected at 5.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) for the next year. In addition to market borrowings, the government aims to raise Rs 4.66 lakh crore through India's small savings fund to cover the budget gap for the fiscal year.
“The government has stuck to the path of fiscal prudence and it was a welcome surprise to see the fiscal deficit revised estimates to be at 5.8% and a glide path towards 5.1% and 4.5% over the next two years. Also, growth in tax assumptions are below 12%, which is conservative and gives the government reasonable elbow room to continue its investment oriented growth plans,” said Aniruddha Naha, CIO – Alternates, PGIM India Asset Management.
Live Events
Indian rupee also edged higher against the US dollar. In her final budget speech before the elections, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a planned 11% increase in infrastructure spending to Rs 11.1 lakh crore for the upcoming financial year, accompanied by efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit. Sitharaman expressed optimism about India's economic prospects. The government, buoyed by surging tax revenue, aims to sustain spending while simultaneously keeping the fiscal deficit under check. Projections indicate a fiscal shortfall of 5.8% of the gross domestic product for the current fiscal year ending in March, slightly below the targeted 5.9%. The government intends to further trim the deficit to 5.1% in the subsequent financial year.
The
interim budget
, preceding the assumption of office by a new administration, outlines a substantial allocation of 11.1 trillion rupees ($134 billion) for capital spending, reflecting an 11.1% increase from the previous year. This budgetary commitment follows a pattern of significant annual rises in capital expenditure by the government over the past three years.
""The FY25 interim Budget has come out better than expected even though the heightened expectations on many changes/giveaways have rightfully not been met now. The resolve to continue fiscal consolidation path will be appreciated by global and local investors. Better than street expectations of fiscal deficit for FY24 and FY25 and the consequent lower borrowings target in FY25 has enthused the bond markets. Announcements on Rail infra spend and 11.1% rise in overall capex would be in line with most expectations. All in all, we think the impact of the interim Budget on equity markets will be neutral to mildly positive for the near term and other emerging triggers will drive its trajectory later,"" said Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities.

“This consistent upward trend, evident in surpassing key milestones, reflects the effectiveness of improved tax administration and heightened taxpayer compliance,” said
Saurabh Agarwal
, tax partner, EY.
The government has settled Rs 43,552 crore toward central GST and Rs 37,257 crore toward state GST from integrated GST collections.
With considerable emphasis on completing audits and investigations relating to earlier years, the number is expected to go up further. “The same collection trajectory in the next two months will ensure that the tax collection targets for the year are comfortably surpassed,” Mani said.
Cumulative collections from April 2023 to January 2024 stood at Rs 16.69 lakh crore, up 11.6% from Rs 14.96 lakh crore in the year-before period.
The indirect tax revenue target for the current fiscal is Rs 15.37 lakh crore, out of which the Centre has budgeted Rs 9.57 lakh crore from GST collections, which includes CGST, the Centre’s share in IGST, and compensation cess.

Hard cash refuses to fold as poll fever pushes demand up,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/hard-cash-refuses-to-fold-as-poll-fever-pushes-demand-up/articleshow/107303034.cms,01-02-2024,"MUMBAI: As India gets ready to conduct the biggest democratic exercise on the planet this summer, cash leakage from its banking system has become more pronounced, indicating unusual demand sustenance for hard currency despite the end to the autumnal festive season.
This fiscal year has thrown up unusual trends as currency leakage — measured through the increase in currency in circulation — plunged for five months starting May due to the return of the Rs 2,000
banknotes
to the financial system. Since October, however, the trend has reversed sharply enough for the pace of currency leakage to match that of the previous year.
Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) data showed that from October to January 19, currency leakage was at Rs 1.2 lakh crore. Comparable figures for the previous year, which included the entire January 2023, were Rs 1.3 lakh crore.
“I would like to believe that the elections are also a factor, among others. As of now, it would be prudent to assume that over any given financial year, you would have at least Rs 3 lakh crore of currency leakage,” said
Namrata Mittal
, chief economist, SBI Mutual Fund.
The
Lok Sabha elections
are likely to be held through April-May. Typically, cash usage increases before polls, particularly the general elections. Use of cash also increases during festivals, a bulk of which occurs in the October-April period that coincides with key kharif and rabi harvests.

“Ideally, as we move toward digital currencies, structurally there should be a force over the longer term to bring currency in circulation lower as a percentage of overall economic activity,” Mittal said. “I would expect that to happen somewhere over the medium term, but the reality today is that it’s stuck at 12% of GDP.”
The currency leakages are also a factor contributing to tight liquidity conditions in the banking system as lenders see more withdrawals. A modest pace of government spending and higher credit growth than deposit mobilisation are other factors that have led to a scarcity of funds for banks, pushing up the cost of borrowings.
“Liquidity in the banking system has worsened in January 2024 with the net deficit staying around Rs 2 lakh crore on average, largely due to monthly GST payments and rise in cash-in-circulation over and above the moderate government spending. In case the liquidity conditions do not improve meaningfully, financing conditions will turn critical,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, director, India Ratings.
While the increase in currency in circulation continues to stay high, higher adoption of digital payments has, however, succeeded in making a slight dent in cash usage.
According to IDFC First Bank economist Gaura Sengupta, outstanding currency in circulation was at 11.6% of GDP as of December 2023, versus 12.2% of GDP a year ago.

Relief to SBI Life: CESTAT dismisses revenue dept's ₹387 cr demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/relief-to-sbi-life-cestat-dismisses-revenue-depts-387-cr-demand/articleshow/107302785.cms,01-02-2024,"In a relief for SBI Life, the Mumbai Bench of
CESTAT
set aside the revenue department's ₹387 crore
tax demand
. The
revenue department
had claimed that the demand stemmed from the difference in
Income Tax
Return and
Service Tax
return amount of
SBI Life insurance
for October 2013-March 2014.
The Customs Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal pointed out that service tax arises from the consideration received by a party for the services it provides and not the difference between income tax and service tax returns filed by the assessee.
The revenue department had stated that
SBI Life
Insurance had shown a service
turnover
of Rs 10,382 crore when filing its tax returns under Income Tax and had paid tax accordingly. But SBI Life Insurance had paid service tax on a turnover of ₹7,254 crore, as a result, it was liable to pay an additional service tax of ₹387 crore at 12.36%.

RBI makes additional amount available to primary dealers under liquidity facility,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-makes-additional-amount-available-to-primary-dealers-under-liquidity-facility/articleshow/107266280.cms,30-01-2024,"The Reserve Bank of India will make an additional amount of funds available to standalone primary dealers under the Standing
Liquidity Facility
starting Thursday, a step that comes at a time when liquidity in the
banking
system is at a large deficit.
“Based on an assessment of the prevailing and evolving liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank of India has decided that an additional aggregate amount of ?5,000 crore will be made available to the Standalone Primary Dealers under the Standing Liquidity Facility at the prevailing
repo rate
starting from January 31, 2024,” the
RBI
said on Tuesday.
At present, the repo rate – the rate at which the RBI lends funds to banks – is at 6.50%.
The RBI said that the incremental limit for individual standalone primary dealers will be conveyed to them separately. The Standing Liquidity Facility is a collateralised liquidity facility provided by the RBI to standalone primary dealers.
Primary dealers (PDs) are entities which function as market-makers in the government securities market, meaning that these players are mandated to buy and sell securities to ensure market depth. PDs are of two types – those that are part of a bank and those that are standalone.

deputy governor Swaminathan J countered the popular notion that a small entity like an
Urban cooperative Bank
(
UCB
) is not
systemically important
and underscored the importance of
governance standards
among others to strengthen them.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
“Some may argue that UCBs are not systemically important in view of their size and turnover” RBI deputy governor Swaminathan J.” However, if we consider the
inter-connectedness
that binds the entire spectrum of
financial entities
, it becomes evident that any vulnerable link has the potential to erode public trust and confidence” Mr Swaminathan J said in his speech titled “ Urban Co-operative Banks: Upholding Governance and Professionalism with Capacity Buidling and Technology Upgradation” delivered to the South based UCBs at Hyderabad last week.
In an increasingly interwoven financial landscape, the ripples of even an apparently small disturbance can resonate far beyond its initial impact, said citing that the failure in 2001 of a Gujarat based UCB and more recently in 2019 to a Mumbai based UCB attest to the
contagion risks
posed by even relatively smaller banks.
UCBs form a critical layer of the financial system of the country. Despite the sector's consistent 3-4% presence in the overall banking business, its significance should not be underestimated, he said. In terms of sheer numbers, with a count around 1,500, UCBs significantly outnumber
commercial banks
. Their outreach extends to a broad spectrum of society, serving common citizens, marginalized sections, small and medium-sized businesses, agriculture, and allied activities.
Transparent decision-making, accountability, and adherence to best practices are paramount. Only Boards whose members meet the standard of fit and proper in terms of age, relevant qualifications, experience and proven clean track record along with the right aptitude will be in a position to deliver the desired results.

The RBI deputy governor also urged UCBs to have a good vigilance system, effective internal audit and fraud detection mechanisms in place. When frauds occur, the bank should promptly report to the regulator and other concerned authorities.” Root causes should be suitably addressed. There should be zero tolerance towards acts of malfeasance” he said.
Another area the deputy governor highlighted was technology. By being proactive in adopting technology, UCBs can position themselves as modern and forward-thinking institutions, attracting a broader customer base and retaining relevance in a digital age. UCBs will continue to leverage on member loyalty.
“However, this can wane with time, generational changes, and of course, competition” he said. “Therefore, I would urge Directors to be receptive to adoption of latest technology but ensure that it is procured through credible suppliers and after proper due diligence”.

""To achieve its projected
economic growth
of USD 2.6 trillion by FY 2047-48, it is essential to enhance the allocation for capital expenditure (CapEx) to 5.7 per cent of the GSDP. Over the cumulative period spanning from FY 2025-48, the state should undertake a total CapEx of USD 111 billion,"" the report said.
Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director, Knight Frank India, said Tamil Nadu has consistently stood out as one of the most economically advanced states in India, making substantial contributions to the national GDP. Its economic structure is well-balanced across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors, fostering stable growth.
""To realize this growth potential, the state must strategically invest in industrialisation and urbanisation... This
investment
will facilitate the envisioned economic growth across sectors including real estate,"" he said.
Agriculture, services, manufacturing, and others play crucial roles in driving the state's economic prosperity. Presently, the services sector stands out as the primary catalyst, contributing 53 per cent to the overall economic growth of Tamil Nadu.
As of 2022-23, the size of Tamil Nadu's construction sector is estimated to be USD 32 billion, contributing 11 per cent to the state's overall economy.
Projected at the current growth rate, this sector is poised to expand to USD 208 billion by FY 2047-48.
The manufacturing sector, which accounts for 19 per cent of the state's economy, is expected to expand to USD 374 billion by FY 2048.

Govt may prune FY25 fiscal gap target to 5.3-5.4% on slower capex,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/govt-may-prune-fy25-fiscal-gap-target-to-5-3-5-4-on-slower-capex/articleshow/107209955.cms,29-01-2024,"North Block
is expected to lower its
fiscal deficit
target meaningfully in FY25, in line with the post-Covid consolidation roadmap, but the Centre's gross
debt
sales will likely remain at this FY's record levels despite
New Delhi
expectedly slowing the pace of investments in capital assets.
A slower pace of
capital expenditure
- after three years of a firm push in that area - may give the Centre the room to bring its fiscal deficit target down by 50-60 basis points to a range of 5.3-5.4% of GDP in FY25 from 5.9% pencilled in this year. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Gross market borrowing, which represents the actual supply of government bonds hitting the market, is seen at ₹15.3 lakh crore in FY25, the median of estimates provided by 11 banks, rating agencies and research houses to ET showed.
In the current financial year, the government has projected its gross market borrowing at ₹15.4 lakh crore, an all-time high. The net borrowing is expected at ₹11.7 lakh crore, a shade lower than ₹11.8 lakh crore for the current financial year, the estimates showed.
HSBC
's economists, who estimated the gross borrowing at ₹15.2 lakh crore for FY25, said that figure represented 4.6% of GDP, down from 5.2% in the current fiscal year. They assume 10.6% nominal GDP growth for the next fiscal year.

As a share of GDP, the borrowing is declining. Indian authorities have emphasised the declining trajectory of debt-to GDP ratio with multilateral agencies and rating firms that flagged potential risks from debt levels.
In FY23, general government debt-to-GDP was at around 81%, down from 88% in FY21, the Centre recently said. In 2018, the figure was at 70.4%. The government, which on February 1 will announce the interim Budget for the next financial year, is committed to bringing down its fiscal deficit target to a level lower than 4.5% of GDP by FY26.
High Borrowings
On the gross borrowing front, it is the massive pile of government bonds up for redemption in the next fiscal year that will keep the absolute numbers elevated, the reduction in the fiscal deficit notwithstanding.

Budget: India may keep 2024-25 gross borrowings close to current year's level,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/budget-india-may-keep-2024-25-gross-borrowings-close-to-current-years-level/articleshow/107143824.cms,25-01-2024,"India's government may keep its gross market borrowing for 2024/25 close to this fiscal year's level, according to two government sources, as it looks to rein in its borrowings that have more than doubled, mainly due to pandemic spending.
India may peg its gross market borrowing for next fiscal year at between Rs 15 lakh crore ($180.47 billion) and 15.5 lakh crore, when Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
presents the
budget
on Feb. 1, the two officials aware of the development told Reuters.
That is close to its Rs 15.43 lakh crore target for the current fiscal year that ends on March 31. Of that, the government has raised about Rs 14.08 lakh crore, or about 91%, as of Jan. 22.
But that is already roughly double its gross market borrowings of Rs 7.1 lakh crore in 2019/20, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The government is serious about reducing its market borrowings this fiscal year,"" one of the officials said.

Both the officials did not want to be named as they are not allowed to speak to the media about budget plans, which are in the final leg of discussions before they are unveiled next week.
The likely gross borrowing figures are also close to economists' estimate of Rs 15.6 lakh crore, according to a Reuters poll.
Despite being an election year where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is bidding for a rare third straight term in power, the government is likely to rein in its fiscal deficit by at least 50 basis points by capping its spending on welfare schemes and subsidies.
The Reuters poll also showed economists expect the government to reduce its fiscal deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic output in 2024/25, from 5.9% this year.
India's finance ministry did not immediately reply to an email and a message seeking comments.

Cost overrun ratio rises to a three-month high in December: MoSPI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cost-overrun-ratio-rises-to-a-three-month-high-in-december-mospi/articleshow/107085614.cms,23-01-2024,"The ratio of
cost overrun
in central
government infrastructure projects
rose to a three-month high of 18.65% in
December
, according to data released by the government, Tuesday. The anticipated completion cost at Rs 30.7 lakh crore was higher than the original cost of Rs 25.9 lakh crore for 1,820 projects each worth Rs 150 crore and above.
The rise in cost overruns was also accompanied by a rise in the number of delayed projects. The ratio of delayed projects rose to 46.6% in December compared with 46.1% in the previous month. Of the 848 projects delayed in December, another 198 reported additional delays.
A fourth of these projects belonged to the megaproject category, which pertains to those with a cost of Rs 1000 crore and above. The average time overrun for the delayed projects was 36.59 months.
The report also pointed out that the extent of cost overruns may be even higher as many ministries had not submitted revised estimates.
“It has also been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures may be under-reported,” the ministry reiterated.

A total of 298 projects of 1,820 available on the government's Online Computerised Monitoring System (OCMS) portal had no date of commissioning or tentative gestation period.
Railways
was the worst performer as regards cost overruns. Of the 250 projects reported under the portal, 138 faced cost overruns in December. The average cost overrun in Railways was 50%, with water resources being the only other infrastructure category with higher cost overruns. For the 41 projects categorised under water resources, the anticipated cost of Rs 69,700 crore was 197% higher than the original cost of Rs 23,466 crore.
Nearly half of the projects in the power sector faced time overruns, whereas the corresponding ratio for railways was 40%. Nearly a third of road and highway projects also faced time overruns.
The government lists delays in land acquisition, environmental clearances, lack of infrastructure support & linkages, and tie-ups for project financing as significant reasons for delays.

States' loan guarantee more than triples since FY17 to Rs 9.4 lakh cr in FY23,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/states-loan-guarantee-more-than-triples-since-fy17-to-rs-9-4-lakh-cr-in-fy23/articleshow/107034587.cms,21-01-2024,"MUMBAI: The total loan guarantees extended by 17 major states to their entities have more than tripled to Rs 9.4 lakh crore by FY23 from Rs 3 lakh crore in FY17, says a report. While guarantees are contingent liabilities, they may pose a risk to states' fiscal health if a substantial proportion of the stock needs to be serviced by them, warranting robust guarantee monitoring and prudent extension of guarantees in the future so that the financial system as a whole remains resilient.
States often sanction and issue on behalf of their various enterprises, cooperative institutions, and urban local bodies guarantees in favour of their lenders which are generally banks or other financial institutions.
The total loan guarantees extended by the 17 major states to their entities have more than tripled to Rs 9.4 lakh crore as of FY23 from Rs 3 lakh crore in FY17. This is equivalent to the entire increase in such guarantees of these states during FY2017-22,
Icra
Ratings chief economist
Aditi Nayar
said in the report.
In fact, such guarantees have been steadily increasing over the years, from Rs 3 lakh crore in FY17 to Rs 7.7 lakh crore in FY21 and to Rs 9 lakh crore in FY22.
The states excluded from the report are the Northeastern states and other hilly states along with Goa.
Live Events
The
RBI
guidelines include tighter rules for ascertaining guarantee ceiling by a state than is being currently implemented by most states as well as assigning risk weights to guarantees, in addition to enhanced monitoring.
The guidelines also state that guarantees should not be extended for external commercial borrowings, the amount guaranteed should be limited to 80 per cent of the loan, etc.
Moreover, the guarantees should not be used for obtaining finance through state-owned entities, which substitutes budgetary resources of the states.
According to Nayar, this is in line with the change in guidelines on off-budget debt issued by the Centre in FY23 and she feels that together, these two will nudge states to become more selective while extending guarantees to their entities.
Additionally, the working group has also urged the lenders to assess a loan proposal from state-owned entities without taking comfort of a guarantee, which should make the lenders more cautious, going forward as well.
After the 32nd conference of the state finance secretaries in July 2022 favoured some regulatory caps on their guarantees, the Reserve Bank had in the same month set up a working group on state government guarantees, and its report was released on January 16 which suggested that the states charge a minimum fee for guarantees extended by them on loans taken by their enterprises, local bodies, and cooperative institutions.
The report specifically calls for a specific ceiling of 0.5 per cent of GDP for additional guarantees to be issued by the Centre annually as stipulated under the FRBM Act.
""States may consider charging a minimum guarantee fee for guarantees extended and additional risk premium may be charged based on the risk category and the tenor of the underlying loan,"" the report said.
The panel has also suggested that state governments may consider fixing a ceiling for incremental guarantees issued during a year at 5 per cent of revenue receipts or 0.5 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product, whichever is less.
The group also wants the word 'guarantee' to include all instruments, which create an obligation, contingent or otherwise, on part of the state government. Further, the purpose for which government guarantees are issued should be clearly defined.
""There should not be any distinction made between conditional/unconditional, financial/performance guarantees as far as the assessment of fiscal risk is concerned as all of these are in the nature of contingent liability that might get crystallized on a future date. Also states must classify the projects/activities as high risk, medium risk and low risk and assign appropriate risk weights before extending guarantees for them"" the panel said.
The RBI had, in the past, flagged the issue of bank finance to government-owned entities, often in violation of the prudential guidelines.
""Since most of these loans are backed by explicit guarantees offered by the state concerned, it may be necessary for the states to take into consideration the risk of guarantee being invoked,"" the report said.

The total value of Rs 2,000 bank notes in circulation, which amounted to Rs 3.56 lakh crore at the close of business on May 19, 2023 (when the withdrawal of the currency notes was announced) has declined to Rs 9,330 crore at the close of business on December 29, 2023.
As much as 97.38 per cent of the high-value currency in circulation as of May 19, 2023, has since been returned to the banking system as on December 29, 2023.
The Rs 2,000 bank notes were introduced in November 2016, following the demonetisation of the then-prevailing Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 bank notes.
The Rs 2,000 bank notes continue to be legal tender.

asset under management
(
AUM
) was achieved on January 10, 2024, he told reporters here.
The AUM has increased from Rs 10 lakh crore to Rs 11 lakh crore in 4 months 18 days (August 24, 2023 to January 10, 2024), he said, adding the
private sector
AUM crossed Rs 2 lakh crore.
The authority in September revised the AUM target of Rs 12 lakh crore for the current fiscal.
The pension authority is working on a minimum assured pension plan, and it could become a reality in the next financial year if the guarantee issued is resolved.
""There are a lot of complications in determining the rate of return, what to set as the bar for return. Fund managers are also thinly capitalised. So, you have to keep a check on their liabilities also,"" Mohanty said.

Asked about the Budget wishlist, he said the move to raise the assured return under the Atal pension plan continues to be on the 'wishlist'.
However, he declined to comment if the Interim Budget may take up the issue. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Interim Budget for 2024-25 on February 1.
The pension fund regulatory body was considering raising the current return of Rs 1,000-5,000 to Rs 2,500-7,500.
The chairman of the pension authority also said that few states who have issued notification to pull out of the National Pension System continued to contribute to the plan irrespective of the on-paper withdrawal.
However, he did not wish to identify the states.

""The target for net revenue receipt for the next fiscal year will be modest, ranging between 9-11%,"" a senior official told ET, adding that this is also on account of the already high base. Tax receipts have exceeded revised estimates in the last two years.

Budget 2024 Live Coverage
The government has budgeted its gross tax revenue at ₹33.6 lakh crore for FY24. Devolution to the states from the Centre's tax revenue is estimated to be ₹10.2 lakh crore in FY24.
After devolution, the Centre's net tax receipt is expected to be at ₹23.30 lakh crore, which is 11.7% higher than the revised estimate in FY23.
Independent assessments estimate a sharper rise in taxes. According to the latest report by Goldman Sachs, income taxes and corporate tax are expected to grow by 15% in FY25, and GST is expected to record a jump of 11%.
A modest tax target will give fiscal headroom if the collections are better. ""It is better to keep it understated considering that global crisis is far from over,"" the official said.
India's net
direct tax
collections touched ₹14.7 lakh crore by January 10, reflecting a growth of 19.4% over the same period of FY23 and crossed 80% of the budgeted direct tax target of ₹18.22 lakh crore.

India could ease China investment curbs if border stays calm,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-could-ease-china-investment-curbs-if-border-stays-calm/articleshow/106953024.cms,19-01-2024,"India could ease its heightened scrutiny of Chinese investments if the two countries' border remains peaceful, a senior Indian official said in the first signal that the four-year-old curbs could be lifted.
Border tensions, the biggest irritant to relations between the nuclear-armed Asian giants, have eased, which could lead to improved investment ties, top industrial policy bureaucrat Rajesh Kumar Singh told Reuters on Wednesday at the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
In 2020, India tightened scrutiny on investments from companies based in countries it borders, adding a layer of vetting and security clearances.
The move was widely seen as retaliation for a clash between Chinese and Indian troops on their disputed, 3,800-km (2,400-mile) Himalayan frontier that killed at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers, their worst military conflict in decades.
The curbs have disrupted billions of dollars of investments between the world's two most-populous countries, halting planned projects including from Chinese automakers BYD and Great Wall Motor.
Live Events
The investment rules ""could change once our relationship there stabilises because I think the border issues that we've had - the border has stabilised"", Singh, secretary at the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, said in an interview.
""On the investment side also, if things go well, I'm sure we can resume normal business.""
He did not give a timeframe for a possible easing.
Asked if India's message was that Chinese investments depend on a peaceful border, Singh said, ""You can't have somebody nibbling at your border while at the same time having red-carpet treatment for investments from there.""
The investment curbs, he said, were a slight ""step back"" from India's broader opening to foreign investment in recent years. India has significantly reduced hurdles for inbound investment, lowering or scrapping foreign ownership caps in many sectors and granting automatic approvals.
China's foreign ministry responded to Singh's comments on Friday, saying the resolution process of the border situation should not affect the normal development of relations between both countries.
""China has always believed that the China-India border issue is an issue left over from history and should be placed in an appropriate position within the bilateral relationship and properly handled,"" ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said when asked at a regular news briefing.
Mao added that China hopes that India will ""fully understand the mutually beneficial nature of China-India economic and trade cooperation"" and sought from India a ""fair, just, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment"" for Chinese companies to invest and operate there.
Despite the border problems, China is India's largest source of imports, with bilateral trade rising 32% since tensions flared to nearly $114 billion in the fiscal year that ended in March.
Indian and Chinese troops clashed twice in 2022 even as peace talks were ongoing. New Delhi and Beijing, which fought a brief border war in 1962, have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the conflict.
The two neighbours must find a way to step back from potential confrontation in the western Himalayas, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in June.
But, Singh said, ""In the last year or so, there haven't been any incidents. So I'm expressing the general hope from the business community that things will, you know, stabilise and improve.""
A mechanism to review foreign investments from all countries, resembling those in the United States and Australia, is an option India could eventually consider, Singh said, adding no decision has been taken as India would want to maintain a ""welcoming environment"" for investments.

StanChart sees Indian government's net borrowing unchanged in FY25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/stanchart-sees-indian-governments-net-borrowing-unchanged-in-fy25/articleshow/106927868.cms,17-01-2024,"India's net government borrowing in the next fiscal is likely to remain largely unchanged, a treasury official at
Standard Chartered
said, adding nearly a fifth of the supply may be absorbed by foreign investors who could invest $25 billion-$30 billion in government debt.
""Central government (is expected) to target a narrower FY25 fiscal deficit of 5.3%-5.6% of GDP, vs 5.9% in FY24, and this can lead to a
net borrowing
of 11.80 trillion to 12.20 trillion rupees ($142 billion-$146.83 billion),"" said Parul Mittal Sinha, head of financial markets, India, at the bank.
Since October, foreign investors have bought more than $5 billion of government bonds that are due for inclusion in the JPMorgan emerging market debt index starting June 2024, according to data from Clearing Corp of India.
""The pace of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows in debt has already increased and we expect the momentum to continue as we move towards June 2024,"" Sinha said.
She said Standard Chartered is positive on Indian government bonds (IGB), and is eyeing moderating inflation, potential monetary policy easing, fiscal consolidation and index inclusion-related inflows as major triggers for 2024.
Live Events
Sinha expects the five-year yield to ease to 6.75%, and the benchmark 10-year yield to fall to 6.85% by the end of June. The yields were at 7.03% and 7.16%, respectively, on Wednesday.
""We expect global sentiment to turn positive on EM (emerging markets), Reserve Bank of India commentary to become more dovish in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meetings, and index inclusion related-inflows in IGBs to continue going into June.""
Foreign investors currently hold 2.14 trillion rupees of bonds, or 2.1% of overall outstanding securities. This includes 1.41 trillion rupees of bonds under the Fully Accessible Route, or 3.7% of the outstanding issuance, most of which will be part of the index.

: India may earmark about 4 trillion rupees ($48 billion) for food and fertiliser subsidies for the next fiscal year, two government sources said, indicating fiscal caution ahead of this year's general election.
Food and fertiliser subsidies account for about one-ninth of India's total budget spending of 45 trillion rupees during the current fiscal year that ends on March 31.

The sources, which are directly involved in the decision making on the subsidies, did not wish to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
For all Budget Updates Click Here
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will unveil the 2024/25 budget on Feb. 1.
The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution declined to comment while the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers did not reply to requests for comment.
Maintaining the combined subsidies at their current level would be unusual for a government facing a national election in just a few months, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to win a rare third term in elections scheduled for April and May.
Also, containing food and fertiliser subsidies is crucial for managing India's fiscal deficit, which Modi's government is targeting at 5.9% of gross domestic product this year and planning to lower by at least 50 basis points in the fiscal year 2024/25.
The food subsidy bill is likely to go up next year as Modi's administration late last year extended its flagship free food welfare programme for the next five years.
India runs its multi-billion dollar food welfare programme, the world's biggest such initiative, by buying rice and wheat from millions of domestic farmers at state-set minimum or guaranteed prices and then supplying the staples for free to 800 million Indians.

"Budget's master math on borrowings to pave way for India's ambitions on fiscal gap, growth & G-secs",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/budgets-master-math-on-borrowings-to-pave-way-for-indias-ambitions-on-fiscal-gap-growth-g-secs/articleshow/106888398.cms,01-02-2024,"Budget Expectations
: The Indian growth story remains healthy ahead of the upcoming General Elections, benefitting in large part from the sharp rise in Government capital spending in the last few years. The recently released Advance Estimates pegged the GDP growth in constant terms at 7.3% for FY2024, an envious level indeed in the tepid global context.
Typically, one would look to the
Union Budget
for cues regarding whether Government policy intent and infrastructure spending would sustain the growth momentum in the year ahead. However, the upcoming Union Budget for FY2025 is set to be a vote-on-account ahead of the Elections. As a result, expectations from the same are limited as major policy changes or announcements are likely to take place only when the full budget is released post the Elections by the newly formed government around July 2024.

Nevertheless, the
fiscal deficit
and borrowing figure indicated in the vote-on-account would be keenly eyeballed, given the intent for fiscal consolidation and implications for yields of Government of India securities (G-sec). ICRA expects the Government of India (GoI) to target a fiscal deficit of 5.3% of GDP in FY2025, midway through the expected print of 6.0% in FY2024 and the medium-term target of 4.5% for FY2026. This would entail an absolute fiscal deficit figure of Rs. 17.1 trillion in FY2025, a welcome decline from the Rs. 17.9 trillion budgeted by the GoI and expected by us for FY2024.

Based on our assumptions for the budget math, this fiscal deficit target would correspond to a healthy capex number of Rs. 10.2 trillion in FY2025. Given our expectations of a Rs. 750 billion shortfall in capex for FY2024 vis-à-vis the budgeted amount, it would imply a double-digit growth of ~10%, albeit lower than the expansion of over 20% seen in each of the post Covid years.

Fiscal deficit & market borrowing math in Budget
We anticipate that two-thirds of the fiscal deficit would be financed through market borrowings in the coming fiscal, in line with what we have seen in FY2023 and FY2024. Given our estimates for the fiscal deficit, we project the net G-sec issuances at Rs. 11.3 trillion in FY2025, a dip of 4.4% from the Rs. 11.8 trillion estimated for FY2024. After accounting for redemptions, the GoI’s gross market borrowings are seen at Rs. 15.0 trillion in FY2025; this implies that a YoY contraction, however mild at 2.8%, would emerge after a gap of two years.

Interim Budget: Fiscal deficit target may be set at 5.3% in FY25, say experts
This decline in the G-sec supply would be complemented with an additional source of demand for the same, stemming from the inclusion of India’s G-secs in the J.P. Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) Global Index suite from June 2024 onwards. Based on the AUMs of the funds tracking these indices, the inclusion could result in FPI inflows of at least $18-22 billion into Indian G-secs through the fully accessible route (FAR) during Jun-Mar FY2025, assuming that India reaches a weight of 7-9% in the GBI-EM Global Index by the end of this period. This translates into an additional demand for G-secs amounting to ~Rs. 1.4-1.8 trillion from this avenue during the fiscal, equivalent to 9-12% of the estimated supply for FY2025, thereby auguring favourably for such yields.
FPI investments in G-Secs
In fact, FPI investments in G-secs have already picked up handsomely ahead of the bond index inclusion, with their total holdings under the FAR and the General Investment Route surging to Rs. 2.0 trillion by end-December 2023 from Rs. 1.7 trillion as on end-September 2023.
In contrast with the Centre, the state governments’ market issuances are expected to witness an uptick in FY2025. Assuming that the states’ fiscal deficit at 3.0% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in FY2025, of which 75% is funded by state government securities (SGS), we peg the net SGS issuance at Rs. 7.3 trillion in the fiscal, 10% higher than the expected amount for FY2024. Further, an uptick in redemptions will take the gross issuances of SGS to Rs. 10.5 trillion from Rs. 9.5 trillion expected in FY2024.
Overall, the contraction in the Centre’s net and gross market borrowings in FY2025 would be almost equally offset by the increase in the same for the states in that fiscal. This implies that the net and gross market borrowings of the General Government (i.e. Centre plus states), at Rs. 18.6 trillion and Rs. 25.5 trillion, respectively, in FY2025, would be marginally higher vis-à-vis the levels expected in FY2024.

Interim Budget 2024-25: Key numbers to watch out
Of great importance for the Indian growth story will be the proportion of the General Government borrowings in FY2025 that are channelized towards financing capex. Policy initiatives as well will affect whether the momentum sustains for this key engine of growth.
A muted increase in total supply of G-secs and SGS implies that the General Government would absorb a relatively lower proportion of savings in FY2025 vis-à-vis FY2024. In fact, the softening in Government bond yields across tenures could lead to a downward shift in India’s yield curve, aided by ICRA’s expectations of a shallow rate cut cycle of 50-75 bps starting from Q2 FY2025. This could also impart a downward bias to corporate bond yields, thereby auguring favourably for corporate borrowers as well. This should help to rev up private capex, another key engine of domestic growth.

fiscal deficit
target of 4.5% of GDP by FY26, against the FY24 goal of 5.9%. It is expected to meet the target this year, which means a reduction of 14 percentage points would be needed in the next two years.
It may target a fiscal deficit of 5.2-5.4% of GDP for the next fiscal year.

Budget 2024: From a record high, Modi govt’s infra juggernaut is now likely to slow down
The hike in capital expenditure is expected to exceed the increase in the overall budget, but much more muted than the 33.4% increase in the current fiscal over the FY23 budgeted level.
The Centre’s capex rose 31% in the first eight months of this fiscal year. Given its high multiplier effect, the government expects elevated capex could continue to spur growth and crowd in private investment in FY25 as well.
Experts said the BJP’s victory in three states — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh —of five in December curbed the space for populism ahead of the general election. However, within the projected revenue spending for FY25, it may prioritise some schemes ahead of elections.
The Centre expects nominal GDP expansion next fiscal to improve from the projected 8.9% in FY24 but remain lower than the levels witnessed in the previous two years, said another person.

"India on cusp of FDI flood, Bajaj Finserv Chair says in Davos",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-on-cusp-of-fdi-flood-bajaj-finserv-chair-says-in-davos/articleshow/106873360.cms,15-01-2024,"Davos
: Another five years of a majority government in
India
could usher in a flood of
foreign direct investment
(
FDI
),
Bajaj Finserv Chair
and Managing Director
Sanjiv Bajaj
told Reuters at the
World Economic Forum
annual meeting on Monday.
""Ten years of this growth we have seen, at least another five years of a strong majority government will end up institutionalising those policies to a fair extent,"" Bajaj said in an interview in Davos, Switzerland.
""It doesn't mean someone can't reverse those things but not easy to do when you have 15 years under your belt, so I think that makes a big difference"", Bajaj added.
Bajaj Finserv
is one of India's leading diversified financial services companies and has helped to reshape the business of consumer finance in the country. It is part of the autos to insurance
Bajaj Group
, one of India's oldest family conglomerates, and has a $32 billion market value.
""For the last 10 years, we've had a single party running the government, that just brings in significant amount of alignment and continuity in policy"", Bajaj said.
Live Events
Prior to Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
's Bhartiya Janata Party government coming to power in 2014 India was led by a coalition government.
India is forecasting annual growth of 7.3% in the fiscal year ending in March ahead of the national elections scheduled to be held before May.
FDI FLOOD
""The next three or four quarters are going to be very important for India to get a larger perspective on foreign direct investment. Are we seeing a flood or a trickle? I believe it is going to be a flood"", Bajaj said, referring to a recent slowdown in inflows.
Companies and investors need time to liquidate investments elsewhere to redirect their cash to markets like India, he said, adding they may be waiting for the outcome of elections.
FDI into India was $71.4 billion in 2022-23, 16% lower year-on-year, official statistics show. The global FDI pot is also shrinking on higher U.S. interest rates and tighter liquidity.
India can at times be slow to get started but companies in the electronics sector are starting to show impressive scale after barely existing a decade ago, he said noting the impact of Modi's efforts to boost manufacturing.
Bajaj is the largest financier for mobile phones in the country, he said. Many of India's lower to middle classes use small loans to buy gadgets.
""For every one Apple that does production in India, it gives tremendous confidence to the next 10, and then next 50,"" he said, adding: ""If Tesla comes in, in the next year or two, again, this will create additional confidence as well.""
As India tries to boost domestic manufacturing and electric vehicle (EV) adoption, U.S. carmaker Tesla is proposing to set up an Indian factory, but is demanding lower EV import taxes.
GROWING PAINS
In November, the Reserve Bank of India applied curbs to a small part of the company's lending business, which Bajaj said the company is in the process of complying with.
""It is important because if you're slipping up somewhere small, tomorrow it could be somewhere big, so we have to make sure that we get stronger and stronger on our compliance side as well, as we're growing as a business"", he added.
""Fortunately, we have 40 different product lines. So if two or three slow down, we have many others that are doing well.""

Ministry of Finance posted on X, ""Benefits in Personal Income Tax! Vide Finance Act, 2023, Section 87A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 has been amended to allow rebate to tax resulting in no
tax liability
to persons having income up to Rs. 7 lakh. (1/5) #PromisesDelivered""
https://twitter.com/FinMinIndia/status/1746736491257376966?s=20
The amendment to Section 87A of the Income-tax Act, 1961, has been implemented to offer a rebate, ensuring no tax liability for individuals with income up to Rs. 7 lakh.
This update aligns with the government's commitment to easing the tax burden on the middle-income segment.
Live Events
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has actively delivered on the budget promises for the fiscal year 2023-24, with a particular focus on
personal income tax relief
.
The Finance Act, of 2023, outlined key changes, including the amendment to Section 87A, which directly impacts the tax liability of individuals.
In the announcement, it was highlighted that the current provision exempts those with income up to Rs. 5 lakh from paying income tax in both the old and new tax regimes.
However, as part of the Finance Act, 2023, the rebate limit has been increased to Rs. 7 lakh for individuals in the
new tax regime
.
This implies that individuals falling within this income bracket under the new tax regime will now be exempt from paying any income tax.
The move aims to provide relief to a broader segment of taxpayers and stimulate economic growth by increasing disposable income.
The announcement also emphasized the government's commitment to delivering on promises and ensuring that citizens receive tangible benefits from the proposed changes.

Rate of rupee depreciation coming down: Piyush Goyal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rate-of-rupee-depreciation-coming-down-piyush-goyal/articleshow/106820222.cms,13-01-2024,"Commerce and Industry Minister
Piyush Goyal
on Saturday said the rate of
rupee depreciation
has come down and expressed hope that after 8-10 years, it will start appreciating against
US dollar
, helping the Indian economy to grow at faster pace. Unlike in the past, Goyal said, the Reserve Bank of India and the finance ministry are working together to push the growth of the country.
The
government
has taken a series of measures to boost economic growth and now India has become the fifth largest economy of the world.
Rupee
has stabilised now, otherwise it used to depreciate at a rate of 3-3.5 per cent annually, he said.
After the
Modi-government
came to power in 2014, the rate of depreciation has come down to about 1.5 per cent.
""In the next 10 years, this will reduce further to about 0.5-0.75 per cent. My personal belief is that after 8-10 years, the rupee will start appreciating and with that, the Indian economy will grow further at a faster rate,"" he added.

Piyush Goyal says US fund house looking to invest $50 billion in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/piyush-goyal-says-us-fund-house-looking-to-invest-50-billion-in-india/articleshow/106784414.cms,13-01-2024,"US-based fund house is looking to invest about $50 billion in India in the next 10 years, a reflection of the country's strong macroeconomic fundamentals, commerce and industry minister
Piyush Goyal
said Friday.
""They said we have invested about $13 billion so far, we expect it to double it in the next four years and then double the figure... in the next four years... just one fund,"" Goyal said at the ET NOW Leaders of Tomorrow Awards. He termed the firm ""one of the most prominent"" investment houses of the US but didn't disclose its name.
Goyal said it shows the excitement of global investors over India, which is the fifth largest economy and no more part of the Fragile Five. Forex reserves have soared to over $600 billion and the government is focusing on modernising India's infrastructure--rail, roads, ports and airports. The comment followed his post on X earlier in the day: ""Discussed the 'India opportunity' in my meeting with Mr. Henry R Kravis, Co-Founder and Co-Executive Chairman of
KKR
, a leading global investment firm from New York."" Goyal emphasised that the world today wants to engage with the country on the trade front and negotiate free trade agreements as India is emerging as a large and trusted partner.
""That is the excitement about India today,"" he stated. ""The fact that today we are the fifth largest economy of the world, no more counted as a Fragile Five economy, solid foreign exchange reserves, $623 billion at the last count, management of inflation appreciated across the globe.""
From 100 startups 10 years ago, Goyal said India is now supporting 115,000 registered startups. The country is poised for high growth in the next two or three decades, taking the economy to $35 trillion.

economy
.
Net
foreign investment
in the year through September fell to $13 billion, according to calculations from HSBC Holdings Plc, down from $38 billion in the same period a year earlier. The figure was at a recent high of $44 billion during India’s 2021 fiscal year, which ends in March.
The pullback comes despite a wave of planned investments announced by foreign companies and
investment funds

Gulf
countries.

The
FDI
figures line up with the trend from official balance of payments data released by the Reserve Bank of India.

The slump in FDI was confounding, HSBC said, given the economy’s rapid growth and increasing share in global trade. The government expects gross domestic product will grow 7.3% in the fiscal year ending in March, matching the pace last year.
In explaining last year’s FDI drop, HSBC said it reflects a shift in investor appetite rather than a loss of interest in the
Indian economy
. One factor is the falling investment in Indian tech start-ups, mirroring a global trend, the bank’s economists said in a Thursday report.
Another factor: declining investment in so-called physical sectors, which includes automobiles, pharmaceuticals and construction. But many investors have signaled recent commitments to invest in emerging sectors, like artificial intelligence, data centers and electric vehicles, the bank said, a sign that investor appetite is shifting to new frontiers.
“Being new, these sectors may take more time than normal to materialize,” HSBC economists wrote. “And when they do, a new wave of FDI will likely come in.”
At an event on Thursday, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das acknowledged the fall in FDI into India recently, but said the decline tracks a pull-back globally.
“I think these are the points which are being missed out,” Das said.

Read our full Budget 2024 coverage
""...major policy changes and announcements are unlikely. ICRA expects the fiscal deficit target for FY25 to be set at 5.3% of GDP, midway through the expected print of 6% for FY24 and the medium-term target of sub-4.5% by FY26,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist, Icra. India has set a target of 5.9% fiscal deficit for FY24. Nayar said the government will also have to curtail its capital spending, as Icra forecasts the government to keep a capex target of ₹10.2 lakh crore in FY25.
""A higher capex target would impinge on the GoI's ability to bridge half the required fiscal consolidation in FY2025, thereby making the task of reaching medium-term fiscal deficit target by FY2026 even more challenging,"" Nayar said.

The capex spending in the first eight months of the year was 59.6% higher than the previous year, with the government spending 58.5% of the ₹10 lakh crore target for FY24. ""While a focus on supporting growth via capex is likely to be maintained, we expect the pace of spending to slow in the FY25 budget. The distribution of capex is likely to be largely towards railways, roads, civil aviation and defence,"" said Rahul Bajoria, MD & Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics, Barclays.
Barclays noted that the government will likely increase budgetary allocations for capex-only loans to state governments to ₹1.5 lakh crore in FY25, from ₹1.3 lakh crore announced in FY24 budget.
However, it said that ""the capacity utilisation of states to undertake more spending on infrastructure projects may be nearing its limits."" Barclays expects fiscal consolidation to be led by increased tax revenues rather than any material cutback in expenditure.

On the tax front, Bajoria projected 15% growth in tax and non-tax revenues in FY25, with the subsidy bill remaining high in the coming fiscal as well. ""With food and LPG subsidy spending plans for the next
fiscal year
already announced, we expect the total subsidy bill to remain elevated in FY25,"" said Bajoria.

Interim Budget 2024: Government may simplify withholding tax math,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/interim-budget-2024-government-may-simplify-withholding-tax-math/articleshow/106739789.cms,12-01-2024,"Union Budget 2024: India is reviewing the entire gamut of
withholding tax
provisions in line with the country's overall thrust to simplify the tax structure to make it easier for businesses and reduce disputes.
There are several
tax deducted at source
(TDS) provisions with different thresholds and multiple rates. This has created a TDS maze that leads to frequent disputes as well as the blocking of
working capital
at businesses.

""There is a need to simplify the regime in view of the complexities that have crept in over time,"" said a government official, explaining the need for the review.
The cleanup of the withholding tax regime could take place in the February 1 interim budget if the review is completed in time.

There are about 33 sections in the Income Tax Act dealing with TDS rates that range from 0.1% to 30%.
For example, before 2020, fees for technical services (FTS) and fees for professional services (FPS) were subject to 10% TDS. The rate was reduced to 2% for FTS. This has led to classification issues between FTS and FPS, sparking litigation.

Interim Budget 2024 likely to present a status report on National Pension System
These issues have been flagged by industry over past few years.
""Whilst in the pre-digital era of tax administration there was some merit in this approach, in current times, some of these elevated rates have put undue working capital pressure, especially on MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) besides increasing compliance burden,"" said EY senior partner Sudhir Kapadia.
With the digitisation of payments and advanced data analytics available with the tax department, there is considerable merit in moving toward lower TDS rates of 1-5% across fewer categories, Kapadia said. The tracking of transactions can still be achieved without putting undue pressure on compliance and working capital, he said.

Fiscal prudence likely to remain top priority yet again for FM Sitharaman?
The concept of TDS was introduced to collect tax from the income source. The idea was to widen the tax base as
TDS provisions
help the government capture additional information, helping to plug revenue leakage. Over the years, the TDS and TCS (tax collected at source) net has widened, and rates have also risen.
Under TDS, a person liable to make a payment of a specified nature to another person will deduct tax at source and remit this into the central government's account. The person from whom income tax has been deducted at source is entitled to get credit for the amount and can adjust it against final tax liability.
A higher TDS rate means greater outgo at the time of receiving income, which increases the working capital requirement as credit for the deduction can only be claimed later.

India faces $10 trillion funding gap in bid to meet net zero pledge: FM Nirmala Sitharaman,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-faces-10-trillion-funding-gap-in-bid-to-meet-net-zero-pledge-fm-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/106739207.cms,11-01-2024,"India stares at a ""
funding gap
"" of $10.1 trillion to honour its
net zero
emissions commitment by 2070, finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said on Thursday, as she called for a carbon credit market at the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Gujarat's GIFT City to address resource constraints for the green transition.
Indian companies will soon be able to access global capital by directly listing on exchanges at the IFSC, a deemed foreign jurisdiction, she said.
""We are going through the process in a systematic manner and I am confident that it will happen at the earliest,"" Sitharaman said.
She was addressing a seminar on 'GIFT City-An Aspiration of Modern India', organised as part of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2024 in Gandhinagar.
Extant rules bar Indian firms from listing overseas directly. They are allowed to access overseas equity markets only through depository receipts, such as the American Depository Receipts and Global Depository Receipts, after they go public in India.
Live Events
Sitharaman said Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
has suggested that a platform be set up where green credits can be traded. ""And I would think the authorities here (GIFT City) should work on getting a platform ready so that green credits can be sold by people who are planting trees,"" she said.
Carbon markets typically allow carbon credits to be sold and bought by businesses and others. Carbon credits are the underlying commodities that enable the buyer to retire a stipulated amount of greenhouse emissions and help them meet their targeted emissions cut. These markets are gaining traction, as an increasing number of global firms are committing to net-zero targets.
Boost to ship building
India needs to bolster its ship manufacturing ability given that it's a major trading nation and there has been a shortage of containers globally, Sitharaman said. There are eight ship leasing entities working at the IFSC which can enable access to global finance, she said.
Her comments come at a time when Indian exporters apprehend a sharp increase in costs in the short term by global shipping companies following militant attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. Domestic exporters have been asking the government to help set up shipping lines in India to reduce excessive
reliance
on foreign firms.
GIFT City progress
Sitharaman said GIFT City is poised to be the ""gateway"" for India's vision to emerge as a developed nation by 2047, with gross domestic product (GDP) exceeding $30 trillion (up from about $3.4 trillion in 2022-23). The IFSC needs to build a diverse fintech laboratory to aid the country's economic progress, she said.
She highlighted Gift City's progress in recent years, stating that it now houses three exchanges, including the International Bullion Exchange; 25 banks, including nine foreign ones; 26 aircraft lessors; 80 fund managers; 50 professional service providers and 40 fintech entities.

DIPAM said interested buyers will be required to submit their bids, indicating the number of shares of companies they intend to bid for and the bid price for the respective shares in a specified form.
The government shall fix a reserve price for shares of each of these companies, which shall not be disclosed, it said, adding that price bids submitted at a value lower than the reserve price shall be rejected.
""Shares will be allotted to eligible bidders who have submitted a valid price bid, on a price priority basis subject to the approval of government of India,"" the DIPAM said.
The procedure and mechanism for disposal of enemy shares, under the custody of CEPI was approved by the Cabinet on November 8, 2018.
SBI Capital Markets was appointed as a merchant banker and selling broker for sale of shares held by CEPI.
Last month, Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra had informed Parliament that shares worth more than Rs 2,709 crore were sold by the government as part of its initiative to dispose of enemy properties in the country.
The sale of such shares is done on the recommendation of a high-level committee which suggests the quantum and price level. The proceeds of sale or disposal of the enemy property are deposited into the consolidated fund of India.

"Budget 2024: Modest divestment targets seen for FY25, medium term",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/modest-divestment-targets-seen-for-fy25-medium-term/articleshow/106712301.cms,11-01-2024,"The government could set modest
disinvestment
targets in budgets not just for FY25 but over the medium term too, as it reviews its sell-off strategy, senior officials said.
The
finance ministry
has stepped up focus on bolstering profitability at central public sector enterprises so they can pay regular dividends to shareholders, including the government, one of the officials told ET.
""Money is fungible. Whether it comes from disinvestment or dividend, it will have the same effect on the
budget
,"" he said. Dividend receipts have, so far this fiscal, already breached the annual target, while disinvestment has hit about a fifth of the goal.
Time-consuming process
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has garnered ₹10,052 crore from disinvestment so far, against the budgeted ₹51,000 crore.
On the other hand, dividend receipts stood at ₹43,843 crore, against the FY24 target of ₹43,000 crore. Last fiscal, DIPAM's dividend receipts had exceeded the government's revised estimate by over 37%, more than offsetting a 29% drop in divestment revenue.

The latest review is spurred by the delay in privatisation bids as the strategic sale process remains time-consuming, and many factors - including market conditions and litigation resorted to by stakeholders - are beyond the government's control, said another official.
In companies where the government can dilute stakes through the offer-for-sale (OFS) route to boost divestment proceeds, volatile market conditions over the past two years - especially with geopolitical tensions and interest rate hikes by advanced economies - have weighed on its efforts.
The government wants to ensure that existing investors in those entities are not shortchanged following the offloading of additional equity shares in the markets during volatile times.
Keeping balance
All these have impacted the disinvestment timelines, as the government seeks to balance its privatisation intent with the imperative of right price for its assets, the official cited said.
""While the privatisation intent is very much there, all factors are looked at while firming up a disinvestment strategy. It's better to have modest annual targets and then exceed them when conditions are favourable, rather than setting high targets and missing them,"" the official said.
Additionally, ""easy"" divestment candidates are gone by now, thanks to the sell-off over the years, an official told ET earlier. The government has raked in as much as ₹4.42 lakh crore in total disinvestment receipts since FY14.
Another official pointed out that in certain cases, DIPAM had to scrap privatisation even after announcing the winning bidders, to protect the integrity of its sell-off drive.
The privatisation of helicopter service provider Pawan Hans, for instance, was called off in July 2023 after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) passed an adverse order against a member of the successful consortium in another case. Similarly, it cancelled the sale of Central Electronics Ltd in September 2022.
The expected shortfall in the divestment mop-up for FY24 follows the likely spillover of the strategic sale process involving IDBI Bank into the next financial year.

Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs app to cut litigation time,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/central-board-of-indirect-taxes-customs-app-to-cut-litigation-time/articleshow/106707546.cms,10-01-2024,"The Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (
CBIC
) will roll out an
app
to alert officials about timely disposition of tax appeals by tracking all cases under the litigation process, officials said.
Named 'Samay', the app will capture all the pending orders across levels from adjudicating officer to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (
Cestat
) to High Courts, and reflect the pendency of review orders that are either under process at various levels or awaiting processing at the commissionerate level. The initiative will greatly reduce the litigation time, CBIC officials said.
""Zonal heads can assess how much time their team is taking to dispose of a case and a reminder will be issued every month after that,"" a senior official told ET. The app was launched during the
National Coordination Meeting
held last month and will be formally made available to officials from January 15, officials said. 'Samay' will have the summary of all the cases and rulings, which can guide an official regarding the legal position on certain demands.
""Our focus is to reduce the litigation time and this technology through the app will help to achieve this,"" said the official cited above. When the department raises a claim against a
GST
payer, the latter can contest the claim at various levels, starting from the adjudicating officer followed by appellate authority (commissioner of appeals) and then can move to tribunals.
As of March 31, 2023, there were about 80,000 pending cases in Cestat, with an average pendency of 4-5 years, as per the revenue department.

demand notices
of ₹1.45 lakh crore to about 1,500 businesses in December over discrepancies in
annual returns
and claims for
input tax credit
for
financial year

The large number is because the last date for serving notices for 2017-18 was December 31, 2023. ""There was a
deadline
factor,"" said a senior official, who did not wish to be identified.
""The ₹1.45 lakh crore comprises
penalty and interest

For 2017-18 and 2018-19, 48,000 GST returns were picked up for scrutiny by December 30 after discrepancies were detected or if flagged by the system, the official said, without giving a breakup for both years.
With the 2017-18 time limit lapsed, the department has shifted its focus to 2018-19 and the volume of notices may increase in the coming days, said officials. ""Of all returns for FY19 picked up for scrutiny, 8,000 are due for further scrutiny,"" said the official cited earlier. The government has extended the deadline for issuing demand notices for discrepancies in returns for 2018-19 and 2019-20 to April 30, from March 31 earlier.

Another reason for wide-scale issuance of notices is weak tax recovery in cases where evasion was detected, officials said.
Weak tax recovery
GST evasion of about Rs 1.51 lakh crore has been detected by
central GST officers
in the current fiscal, while recovery stands at Rs 18,541 crore as on December 30, against the internal target of Rs 50,000 crore. The
finance ministry
on Sunday said that since mid-May 2023, a total of 29,273 bogus firms involved in suspected input tax credit evasion of Rs 44,015 crore have been detected.
It said this has helped save Rs 4,646 crore - Rs 3,802 crore by blocking input tax credit and Rs 844 crore by way of recovery - and that 121 arrests had been made so far in the cases.
Tax officials detected evasion of Rs 1.31 lakh crore in 2022-23, with recovery of Rs 33,226 crore.
""Notices for 2018-19 are currently being issued for recovery of tax liabilities on both factual and interpretation issues,"" said Saurabh Agarwal, tax partner, EY.

"Centre may rake in ₹55,000 crore in dividends from key CPSEs",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-may-rake-in-55000-crore-in-dividends-from-key-cpses/articleshow/106617507.cms,07-01-2024,"The government's
dividend
collection from non-financial central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and other investments in this financial year could amount to about ₹55,000 crore, more than a quarter higher than the budgetary target of ₹43,000 crore, said a senior official.
However, the Centre could reduce its combined disinvestment and dividend (from non-financial CPSEs) mop-up in the revised estimate for 2023-24 from the budgeted ₹94,000 crore given the expected steep shortfall in divestment proceeds from the targeted ₹51,000 crore due to the
IDBI Bank
strategic sale process spilling over to 2024-25, the official told ET.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management has garnered ₹53,895 crore in dividend and disinvestment receipts so far this fiscal. At ₹43,843 crore, the dividend has already exceeded the 2023-24 target, even as the disinvestment revenue has remained low at ₹10,052 crore. ET had reported in November 2023 that the 2023-24 dividend target could be surpassed but the surplus dividend might not be enough to fully make up for the disinvestment shortfall.
But given that the combined target makes up less than 3.5% of the government's budgeted non-debt receipts for the fiscal, any such shortfall may not disrupt the government's financial calculations, said another official. One of the officials said there is only a remote possibility of the dividend receipts exceeding last fiscal's level of ₹58,988 crore. A significant driver of last year's dividend revenue was
Hindustan Zinc Ltd
(HZL), which forked out about ₹9,000 crore to the government on its 29.54% holding in the miner, he said. Such a sum from HZL is not feasible in this fiscal as it has depleted its cash reserves.
Moreover, prospects of huge dividends by large state-run oil firms, which usually account for a significant chunk of such non-tax revenue, are uncertain this year given the volatility in global crude oil prices in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas war.

If the global crude oil prices bounce back again and state-run oil firms don't pass on the costs to consumers in the build-up to the 2024 general election, their profitability and ability to pay dividends may falter, officials had told ET in November 2023. CPSEs from some other sectors, such as power, are doing well and may continue to give good dividends.
The average monthly crude oil price (Indian basket) has moderated to $77.1 so far in January. from $77.42 in December and $90.08 a barrel in October (the war started on October 7). Global oil prices rose again last Friday amid fears the crisis may escalate to other parts of West Asia, adding fresh uncertainties to any benign outlook.

No e-way bill sans e-invoice details from March 1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/e-way-bill-generation-without-b2b-e-invoice-details-to-be-blocked-from-march-1/articleshow/106590476.cms,06-01-2024,"In an advisory issued late on Friday, the National Informatics Centre (NIC) asked all taxpayers and transporters to make necessary changes inA their system so that they can adapt to the new norm from March 1.
According to NIC, the move was initiated after many cases surfaced where the invoice details entered separately under
e-way bill
and
e-invoice
were not matching with respect to certain parameters.
This is leading to mismatch in the e-way bill and e-invoice statements. ""To avoid such situations, e-way bill generation will not be allowed without e-invoice details from March 1, 2024,"" NIC said.
This will be applicable for all businesses with turnover above ₹5 crore for e-invoice enabled tax payers and for the
transactions
related to supplies under B2B (Business to Business) and exports. However, e-way bills for other transactions, such as B2C (Business to customers) and non-supplies, can be generated as before, NIC said.
E-way bills are mandatory under the goods and services tax regime for inter-state transportation of goods valued at more than ₹50,000. E-Invoice has been operationalised since October 2020.

: India could set a target for divestment from state firms in fiscal 2024-25 that falls short of this year's goal to stand at the lowest in nine years, as the government turns its focus to general elections due next year, a senior official said.
The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not give an exact figure as the finance ministry is preparing the national budget for next year, to be presented in parliament on Feb. 1.
Setting a figure below this year's
divestment target
of Rs 510 billion ($6 billion) would make it the lowest since the Rs 400 billion set in fiscal 2013/14, when Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
stormed to power for his first term.
Still, a lower target for the next
fiscal year
, which begins on April 1, looks likely as the government is unsure whether regulatory delays will allow it to complete the sale of a majority stake in
IDBI Bank
, the official added.
""There is no clarity on when the 'fit and proper' vetting would be completed, and there will be other approvals required from the RBI once a buyer is shortlisted, making the process time-consuming,"" the official said.

The official, who sought anonymity as finance ministry officials are not allowed to speak to the media during budget preparation, was referring to the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India.
India's finance ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters email request for comment.
When completed, the sale of IDBI Bank is expected to bring more than Rs 200 billion ($2.4 billion) into government coffers, according to a Reuters calculation based on its share price.

The impending elections may shift the government's focus away from divestment and privatisation, the official said.
Governments are generally cautious about launching such exercises ahead of elections, because of the risk of opposition from employees and their powerful unions.
Modi's government has met its privatisation and divestment target only twice in the last decade, even though his government's track record outstrips that of any previous administration.
Despite aiming in 2020 to divest state-run firms in sectors from banking and insurance to transport and energy, the government's only notable success was Air India, while lack of interest forced it to withdraw others, like Bharat Petroleum Corp.

The government official added that the scope for sales of minority stakes in some big state-run companies has narrowed.
This is because the government's shareholding has hit the permissible limit of 51% in many such firms, limiting its ability to raise funds through such sales, he added.
Lowering the divestment target shows the government may be reassessing its policy and may want to focus on running such exercises professionally, said Sandeep Shah, managing partner at a consulting firm, N.A. Shah Associates LLP.
""The recent large dividend payouts, coupled with profitability of public sector companies, and investor interest, can be a trigger point,"" Shah added.
India foresees the dividend payout from state-run firms this fiscal year to exceed government expectations.

government
will likely exceed its
fiscal year target
for dividends from state-run companies by at least 120 billion rupees ($1.4 billion), partly offsetting an expected shortfall from share sales, a government source aware of the matter said on Thursday.
The
dividend
receipts could range from 550 billion rupees to as much as 600 billion rupees, the source said, potentially topping not only the government's target of 430 billion rupees for the April-March
fiscal
year but also the 595 billion rupees it collected in dividends last fiscal year.
So far this fiscal, India has received 438 billion rupees in dividends from state-owned firms, according government data.
The high dividend will partly offset the shortfall in
government's revenue
from sale of equity in state-run enterprises.
The government may not be able to mop up even 300 billion rupees through stake sales this fiscal year, which will be an over-40% shortfall, the source said.

""As on date, the STL outstanding is nil,"" it said in a statement, adding that in the existing

""Floating of Short Term Loan (STL) Tender by Food Corporation of India (FCI) is a regular phenomenon to empanel scheduled banks to offer STL as and when required to meet FCI's working capital requirements to ensure timely release of payment to Farmers, state Govt. Agencies, vendors, etc,"" it said.

Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
The FCI has invited bids from banks for raising a three-month tenure loan to likely meet its
cash flow
mismatch and for the procurement and distribution of food grains, said a person familiar with the matter.
This short-term loan will be on an unsecured basis. Fully owned by the government, FCI has a paid-up capital of Rs 9,999.79 crore.
""The corporation has invited bids and generally, the interest rate for such tenure loans are around 7%,"" said a bank executive aware of the matter.
FCI, in its bids, has sought revolving credit, which essentially means it can avail short-term loans from lenders if their outstanding loan on the date of request is less than the quantum originally offered, irrespective of disbursements and repayments already done.

finance
ministry has sought expenditure proposals for the second and final batch of Supplementary
Demands for Grants
from various ministries and departments ahead of the Budget session likely to commence in the last week of January.
This would be the last session of the 17th Lok Sabha before the general elections and the government would seek expenditure approvals of Parliament for four months till July 2024 through a vote on account.
The second batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2023-24 is proposed to be placed before Parliament in the ensuing Budget session, the finance ministry said in an office memorandum.
The cases that would be eligible to be incorporated under such demands include those where advances from the
Contingency Fund
have been granted.
Besides, payments against court decree would be included as well as cases where the finance ministry has specifically advised moving the supplementary
demand
in the winter session, it said.
Live Events
""While processing proposals for
supplementary grants
, the grant controlling authority must invariably identify savings within the grant so that the infructuous or inflated supplementary demands are weeded out and the eventuality of surrender after obtaining the supplementary grant is avoided,"" it said.
According to the memorandum dated December 29, the ministries are required to submit their supplementary proposals by January 8.
The interim Budget 2024-25 is likely to be presented on February 1. The Budget approval process has been streamlined by the Government led by Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
for better utilisation of funds.
Previously, when the Budget was presented at the end of February, a three-stage Parliament approval process used to be completed sometime in mid-May, weeks ahead of the onset of monsoon rains.
This meant government departments would start spending on projects only from August-end or September after the monsoon season ended.

November
compared to 19.9 per cent in the year-ago period, mainly in the wake of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) introducing punitive risk weighting for loans. The moderation in personal loan disbursals was also due to a downward trend in fresh credit growth in the housing segment, the RBI said on Friday in its report on the sectoral deployment of bank credit for November.
In terms of total outstanding, at the end of November, fresh personal loan disbursals stood at Rs 50,56,524 crore, compared to Rs 41,80,838 crore in the same period a year ago, as per the data.
However, the growth for the month of November this year fell to 18.6 per cent, as against 19.9 per cent recorded in November 2022.
The latest data comprises loan deployment by 41 banks, which accounts for about 95 per cent of the total non-food credit deployment.

Sharing his year-end musings on X (erstwhile twitter), Kotak highlighted a changing landscape where savers are transforming into investors, presenting challenges for the banking sector regarding deposits and funding costs.
""As savers become investors the banking sector faces challenges on its deposits and cost of funds. The large corporate sector has to meaningfully move to capital markets (debt and equity) and away from banks,"" Kotak wrote on a Twitter post which he called his year-end musings and titled 'A Financial Sector Model for India’s dream: 9% annual growth, $30 trillion GDP by 2047'.
""Banks will become distributors of corporate debt rather than storage houses. They will need to penetrate mid sized corporates, MSMEs and consumers,"" he added.
He also said that we need to keep Japan of the 80s at the back of our mind.

Kotak urged vigilance against market bubbles. Referring to the prolonged stagnation of Japan's Nikkei Index even after 34 years, he stressed the importance of policies, regulations, education, and the supply of high-quality investments to prevent similar situations.
Addressing taxation issues, Kotak pointed out the need for a relook at double taxation on dividends, drawing a parallel between shareholders and partners regarding taxation principles. He also stressed the necessity of bridging the gap between debt and equity tax rates to encourage market growth.
Expressing concerns over the potential distortion caused by low-cost leverage through derivatives, Kotak highlighted the importance of attention to prevent market imbalances.
Moreover, Kotak flagged the importance of maintaining a balance between developmental initiatives and regulatory measures. He specifically highlighted two critical areas needing immediate attention in India’s financial sector: acquisition financing and streamlining the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process.

""As India aspires, the financial sector will be the key engine for delivery. Impact of technology is a separate subject of discussion for a future date. The saver/ borrower and the issuer/ investor models will coexist. It is time for a holistic financial sector view,"" said Kotak.
Reflecting on India's evolution from a nation of savers to investors, Kotak noted the historical reluctance of Indian savers toward financial assets, preferring gold and land investments. However, over time, there has been a gradual shift towards bank deposits, UTI, and
LIC
.
In the 1990s, investing in stocks was viewed as speculative, leading companies seeking capital to approach foreign institutional investors (FIIs). While FIIs saw opportunities and invested in companies, Indian savers remained hesitant. This resulted in companies raising capital through the lesser-known Luxembourg stock exchange, essentially exporting India’s capital market.
Recognising this trend, some individuals raised the issue with
SEBI
, prompting the inception of the private placement market (QIP) in the early 2000s, Kotak said. Consequently, FIIs gained access to Indian markets, and the interest of Indian savers in the stock markets grew notably after the global financial crisis.

Highlighting the growth trajectory in the financial landscape, Kotak commended the transformation of savers into investors through mutual fund platforms, equities and derivatives markets, insurance funds, and global private equity in India, among other avenues.
The journey from a risk-averse saver to an eager investor has been a significant evolution, with various financial avenues paving the way for a more vibrant investor ecosystem in India.

Indian state banks to snap two-month streak of selling govt debt: Traders,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indian-state-banks-to-snap-two-month-streak-of-selling-govt-debt-traders/articleshow/106347586.cms,28-12-2023,"Indian state-run banks are likely to resume buying government debt next year, after two months of sales, to cash in on attractive prices, especially before they start rising due to firming expectations of rate cuts, traders told Reuters.
These banks, typically the biggest buyers of government debt, have sold bonds worth Rs 14,380 crore ($1.73 billion) on a net basis so far in December, following sales of Rs 8,840 crore in November, clearing house data showed.
That was after they bought Rs 16,500 crore of notes in October, when the central bank said it would start open market bond sales to manage liquidity.
That news sent the 10-year benchmark bond yield surging 14 basis points (bps) in October, but the lack of any auctions since has contributed to the yield pulling back.
""There was a decent rally in the last couple of months in bonds after the October jump in yields, and this gave a profit booking opportunity,"" a senior treasury official at a state-run bank said.

The pullback has left the 10-year yield around 7.20%, which traders say is attractive.
""The current level is a strong entry point and we would indulge in adding at these and any higher levels,"" the treasury head at another state-run bank said.
The officials requested anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
The government is scheduled to raise only Rs 2.37 lakh crore through debt sales in January-March, sharply below the over four trillion rupees supply in each of the previous quarters.
Treasury officials plan to become more active at primary auctions, rather than indulge only in secondary purchases.
Foreign inflows too, are expected to continue amid front-running ahead of the country's debt being included in the JPMorgan index in June.
Moreover, the central bank is widely expected to start easing policy rates by the middle of the year, which is likely to push yields down further, traders said.
""Benchmark yield should not rise much from current levels,"" said Vijay Sharma, a senior executive vice president at primary dealership
PNB Gilts
.
""We expect a test of 7.10% levels in the last quarter, which leaves some room for fresh position building.""

I-T uses fine-tooth comb to nab both employers & employees for TDS-claims mismatch,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/tech-taxes-i-t-lens-on-mismatch-in-tds-and-claims/articleshow/106276764.cms,26-12-2023,"Mumbai: A mismatch between what an employer computes and what an employee
claims
can drag both under the
taxman
's glare.
The
Income Tax
(I-T) department is using a fine-tooth comb to nab discrepancies in the
tax deducted at source
, or
TDS
, by companies and the declarations by its employees in the annual I-T returns. What's underway is a line-wise reconciliation of the two sets of numbers under different heads - house rent allowance, medical insurance, outgo on home loans,
tax saving investments
under 80c etc.
Around early December, several companies in Mumbai, Delhi and other big cities have been served notices under Section 133C which was introduced in 2014-15, empowering authorities to call for information to verify details. The companies are being asked to either 'confirm the information' or 'furnish a correction statement', two persons aware of the exercise told ET.
The aim of the department is to track cases where tax has escaped with either the company deducting less TDS than it should have or employees claiming refunds through extra investment declarations -- not stated earlier during the year but later included while finalising the ITRs.
""The section 133C (introduced in 2014-15) has been sparingly used so far. But recently many companies have received notices under this section. This would pave the way for a line-wise verification. It's a smart use of technology by the department with the system making such granular level verification of the reportings by both sides -- the deductors in their withholding tax returns as well as the taxpayers in their ITRs. The department is probably well aware of the limitations -- such an exercise is not feasible manually for covering a large number of taxpayers. So, a system-related verification is being done to identify the gaps,"" said Rahul Garg, Managing Partner, Asire Consulting, which advises on tax and regulatory matters.
Live Events
An annexure to the recent round of notices gives a list of employees.
According to Garg, it's important that only the right cases are picked up for scrutiny either at the level of the company or employees. ""This could help in a more cautious approach towards withholding tax compliances with right validations at the level of employers (the deductors), right claims by taxpayers, increase in tax collection, and widening of tax base through a fair selection of the old and new tax regime for individuals,"" he said.
The law puts the responsibility on the employer for correctly computing the TDS of persons it hires and reporting it every quarter. But traditionally, the focus of companies has not been closely verifying the declarations by employees; in some cases employees may not submit the actual documents in time; also, not adequate validation is done by service providers -- several of them are software companies -- to whom companies typically outsource the payroll work.
""This is an effective tool to identify wrong claims. The parties receiving the notices should immediately comply as there is a penalty provision applicable for not replying. If data required is voluminous, then adjournment should be sought. Parties should not take it lightly,"" said Rajesh P Shah, partner at the CA firm Jayantilal Thakkar and Company.
Interestingly, if employees make fake claims and the companies endorse them, a gap will not readily show up in the tax office system. But any difference between the two sets of information would be immediately spotted. However, if a case is picked up by the tax office, chances are it would end up going through records of all employees.

Disinvestment fetches over Rs 4.20 lakh cr in 10 years but target to be missed again in FY24,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/disinvestment-fetches-over-rs-4-20-lakh-cr-in-10-years-but-target-to-be-missed-again-in-fy24/articleshow/106262884.cms,25-12-2023,"With general elections on the horizon, the government's privatisation bandwagon has almost but stalled as a government wary of being accused of selling family silver opts for minority stake sales on stock exchanges over outright privatisation. The result -- the disinvestment target for current fiscal year is again likely to be missed.
Big ticket privatisation plans such as that of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) and CONCOR are already on the backburner and analysts feel meaningful privatisation can happen only after April/May general elections.
In the current fiscal, out of the budgeted amount of Rs 51,000 crore, about 20 per cent or Rs 10,049 crore has been collected through minority stake sales via IPO (Initial Public Offering) and OFS (Offer For Sale).
Strategic sale of a host of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), including SCI, NMDC Steel Ltd, BEML, HLL Lifecare and IDBI Bank, are in the pipeline for completion in the current fiscal.
However, with the process of due diligence and demerger of core and non-core assets yet to be completed with respect to most of the CPSEs, there has been a delay in inviting financial bids.

In the case of IDBI Bank, where the government had received multiple EoIs (Expressions of Interest) back in January 2023, the bidders are yet to get security and 'fit & proper' clearance from the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), respectively.
Hence the privatisation of all the CPSEs in the list and IDBI Bank are likely to spill over into the next financial year.
In total, there are around 11 transactions which are being processed by DIPAM (Department of Investment and Public Asset Management) currently.
There are three more -- Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) and subsidiaries of AI Asset Holding Ltd(AIAHL), the entity holding the former subsidiaries of the now-privatised Air India, for which 'in principle' approval of the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) is already in place but EoIs have not been invited by DIPAM.
""Strategic disinvestment decisions are being governed by political necessities. With elections round the corner, we do not expect any movement on the strategic sale side,"" a market expert said.
General elections in India are due in April-May next year.
Fitch Ratings had earlier this month predicted that the incumbent Narendra Modi administration is ""most likely"" to retain power in the elections.
One of the challenges before the government with regard to strategic sale of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) or Vizag Steel is vehement opposition by employee unions.
Although the government has been narrating the turnaround success story of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL), which was bought by Tata Steel Long Products (PSLP) in 2022 for Rs 12,100 crore, RINL privatisation still remains a challenge as employees are demand that it be given to a public sector company.
After the successful privatisation of the then loss-making Air India to Tata group and NINL to TSLP in 2022, the government was hopeful of going ahead with more CPSE divestments and reaching a quick conclusion.
However, 2023 has no good news on the strategic sale front. The difficulties involved in the strategic sale process, with the involvement of multiple stakeholders, makes the task at hand a long drawn affair.
Economic think tank GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said the pace of PSU (Public Sector Undertaking) stake sales in India has slowed down recently. Compared to a more active 2021-2022, the number of major PSU stake sales in 2023 has been fewer.
""The disinvestment trend has recently experienced a deceleration due to various factors, including extended regulatory processes, global economic volatility, political opposition to privatisation in certain sectors and shifting government priorities in the run-up to the 2024 general elections,"" Srivastava said.
According to him, the disinvestment of certain PSUs, particularly in strategic sectors like defence (BEML) and shipping (SCI), face public and political resistance, leading to postponements and policy reassessments.
""With the general elections approaching in 2024, the government's focus may shift to other political agendas, impacting the priority of these stake sales,"" he said.
Out of the around Rs 4.20 lakh crore raised in the last 10 years from disinvestments, Rs 3.15 lakh crore was realised from minority stake sales and Rs 69,412 crore came from strategic transactions in 10 CPSEs -- HPCL, REC, DCIL, HSCC, NPCC, NEEPCO, THDC, Kamarajar Port, Air India and NINL.
""A fundamental principle behind the government's policy in the post-2014 period has been the engagement with the private sector as a partner in the development process. The government's disinvestment policy has been revived in the last eight years with stake sales and the successful listing of PSEs (Public Sector Enterprises) on the stock market,"" the Economic Survey 2022-23 had said.

The commission would submit its report for the five-year period (2026-27 to 2030-31) to the President by October 31, 2025.
Besides suggesting tax devolution between the
Centre
and states and revenue augmentation measures, the commission would review the present arrangements for financing disaster management initiatives with reference to the funds constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

DCP
as food subsidy during the period between January 1, 2023 to December 15, 2023, it said in response to a question in
Lok Sabha
on Wednesday.
This amount was given as food subsidy under the
National Food Security Act
(
NFSA
) and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). Food grains at subsidized prices are made available by the FCI to states under the PMGKAY for which subsidy is released to the FCI.
Under the scheme, launched in April 2020 in the wake of covid-19 pandemic, 5kg of foodgrain per person per month is provided free of cost to all beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).
In case of states participating in the decentralized procurement, state governments take the responsibility of procurement of foodgrain and it's distribution to eligible households. In such states subsidy is released to the state.
The central government bears the expenditure incurred by the state on procurement operation as per approved costing.

Banks are making concerted efforts to reduce the percentage of inoperative accounts and the progress is being regularly monitored by the government, he said, adding that banks also organise camps at the local level to create awareness about good banking habits, including the benefits of keeping the account active/operative.
As a result of various initiatives, the percentage of inoperative accounts has come down from 40 per cent in March 2017 to 20 per cent in November 2023.
As per the
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) guidelines, a savings as well as current account should be treated as inoperative/dormant, if there are no customer-induced transactions in the account for over a period of two years.
The reasons for the account turning inoperative can be many and it has no direct co-relation to the account-holder being untraceable.
Customers at any point of time can make a request for activation of inoperative account without being charged. The banks make these accounts operative after completing necessary Know Your Customer (KYC) formalities.
Replying to another question, Karad said the transfer of Rs 820 crore to various account holders under the Immediate Payment Service (
IMPS
) facility took place in
UCO Bank
.
The Reserve Bank of India has apprised that up to December 7, UCO Bank has recovered Rs 705.31 crore from 28,891 accounts.

fiscal deficit
target of 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the financial year 2023-24, junior finance minister Bhagwat Karad said on Monday.
India's fiscal
deficit
in the first seven months of the financial year ending on March 31, 2024 was Rs 8.04 lakh crore ($96.86 billion), or 45% of the estimate for the whole year, according to data released by the government last month.
However, the government has collected only Rs 10,050 crore from selling stakes in government-run firms as of Dec. 13, against its full-year target of Rs 51,000 crore, Karad told lawmakers.
""It is difficult to anticipate the quantum of actual proceeds from divestment during the current financial year 2023-24,"" because stake sales depend on factors including market conditions and investor appetite, Karad said.
The Indian government could miss its stake sale target for the fifth straight year, and will struggle to raise even half of the proceeds it had targeted from planned sales of state-run firms this year, Reuters reported last month.

The Centre has budgeted ₹18.20 lakh crore from
direct taxes
in FY24, a 9.6% rise from the latest estimate available for FY23. The budget estimate (BE) for direct tax revenue in the last fiscal (FY23) was ₹14.2 lakh crore. It was later revised to ₹16.5 lakh crore and ended marginally higher at ₹16.61 lakh crore.
""We expect the direct tax collections to overshoot the
budget estimates
,"" said Nayar.
Last week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its FY24
GDP
forecast to 7%, from 6.5% estimated earlier, after the economy surprised on the upside, expanding 7.6% in the September quarter.
The healthy advance tax collections indicate robust corporate profits.
Corporate earnings
The better-than-budgeted tax collections will give the government room to meet its
fiscal deficit
target for FY24, pegged at 5.9% of GDP.
""The growth is reflective of the jump in corporate earnings and an indication that the economy is continuing to expand at a healthy pace,"" Rohinton Sidhwa, partner, Deloitte India. ""In addition, final self-assessment taxes due also seem to have aided the collections as the return filing deadlines have expired on November 30.""
Advance tax collections in FY23 for the April 1 to December 17 period were ₹5.21 lakh crore, and for April 1 to September 17, ₹3.55 lakh crore.

The call centre, set up in Mysuru, helped the department settle a total of 146,385 outstanding tax demands. These were the cases where the taxpayers had paid lower tax than the actual tax liability.
The department had set up the centre to resolve any mismatch between the tax demand and tax paid by the taxpayers.
The centre also reached out to taxpayers to settle any pending validation of the taxpayers’ bank accounts.
“We have started a unique demand management facilitation system about a year back for all such cases where refunds are held up due to a variety of reasons,” Central Board of Direct Taxes chairman Nitin Gupta had told media persons in October.

Old Pension Scheme to restrict states' capacity to undertake development activities: RBI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/old-pension-scheme-to-restrict-states-capacity-to-undertake-development-activities-rbi/articleshow/105964883.cms,13-12-2023,"Mumbai: Sounding a note of caution, a Reserve Bank report has said that reverting to the DA-linked
Old Pension Scheme
(OPS) will exert huge pressure on state finances and restrict their capacity to undertake developmental expenditure. The Reserve Bank's report on 'State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2023-24' also said the provision of non-merit goods and services, subsidies, transfers and guarantees will render their fiscal situation precarious.

The governments of
Rajasthan

Himachal Pradesh
have informed the central government and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (
PFRDA
) about their decision to revert to OPS for their state government employees.
These state governments have requested for withdrawal/ refund of contribution, along with return thereon, the finance ministry has recently informed Parliament.
The central bank's report said the return to the Old Pension Scheme by a few states, and reports of some other states moving in the same direction would exert a huge burden on state finances and restrict their capacity to undertake growth-enhancing capital expenditures.
""Internal estimates suggest that if all the state governments revert to OPS from the National Pension System (NPS), the cumulative fiscal burden could be as high as 4.5 times that of NPS, with the additional burden reaching 0.9 per cent of GDP annually by 2060,"" the report said.

This, the report said, will add to the pension burden of older OPS retirees whose last batch is expected to retire by early 2040s and, therefore, draw pension under the OPS till the 2060s.
""Thus, any reversion to OPS by the states will be a major step backwards, undermining the benefits of past reforms and compromising the interest of future generations,"" it said.
The report noted that some states have budgeted for fiscal deficits exceeding 4 per cent of GSDP in 2023-24 against the all-India average of 3.1 per cent.
They also have debt levels exceeding 35 per cent of GSDP against the all-India average of 27.6 per cent.
""Any further provision of non-merit goods and services, subsidies, transfers and guarantees will render their fiscal situation precarious and disrupt the overall fiscal consolidation achieved in the last two years,"" it said.
According to the report, the improvement achieved in state finances in 2021-22 was sustained in 2022-23, with the combined states' gross fiscal deficit (GFD) contained at 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) - below the budget estimates for the second consecutive year - primarily through a reduction in the revenue deficit.

GST council
in its 52nd meeting on October 7.
In October the centre had notified the detailed rules for the appointment and service of president and member of the Goods and Services tax (GST) Appellate Tribunal.
It said that the members and president shall be paid a salary of Rs 2.25 lakh per month and in case they are in receipt of any pension, the pension amount will be deducted from the salary.
The President and member are entitled to draw allowances and benefits as are admissible to a Government of
India

Goa has not submitted AG's certificate for FY 2017-18, FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20. It is also yet to send the report for FY 2021-22 and the first quarter of FY 2022-23.
""For 2022-23 no state, except for Karnataka, has given AG's certificate as yet,"" she said.
West Bengal has also not submitted AG's report from FY 2019-20 to the first quarter of FY 2022-23.
""AG's certificate has not come from West Bengal, so the amount would not be released,"" she said, adding, ""to call it pending, I am sorry, its a misnomer. Let them send AG's certificate, we will clear it.""
There are several other states which have not submitted AG's report.
""Kerala has sent us AG's certificate but has also told us to hold on till they reconcile the numbers with AG themselves. So we are holding on. It is not pending from our side,"" she added.
Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, who was also in the house, said there are no GST dues of any state government. It has already been given to the concerned states.
""Even some states have not sent their AG's report, despite that we have made some provisional payments. Once AG's report is received, they will receive final payment,"" he said.
Congress member Rajiv Shukla raised the issue of misuse of arrest provisions and wanted to know the steps that the government is going to take for simplification of the GST filing procedure.
Replying to it, Sitharaman said the finance ministers of state governments, which are part of the GST Council, are being told about the difficulties faced by traders and the business communities on the ground.
""The GST Council does discuss these things and periodically the forms are being simplified accordingly,"" she said.
Over the misuse of authority by local officers exceeding his brief, Sitharaman said action had been taken by the council.
The finance minister further said she would welcome any member who thinks that there are difficulties faced on the ground, particularly officers who are exceeding their briefs, she would be happy to receive and take action against them.

The total supplementary demands for spending by the Ministry of External Affairs were Rs 20,000 crore, which would be adjusted against the reduction of expenditure of over Rs 9,000 crore.
For the full 2023-24, the government has budgeted the fiscal deficit to be Rs 17.86 lakh crore or 5.9 per cent of the GDP.
The April-October fiscal deficit was 45.6 per cent of the full-year Budget Estimate of the last fiscal.

FM Sitharaman clarifies why states like West Bengal have not received GST funds for years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/fm-sitharaman-clarifies-why-states-like-west-bengal-have-not-received-gst-funds-for-years/videoshow/105931722.cms,12-12-2023,
Old pension scheme to be 4.5 times costlier than the new one,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/old-pension-scheme-to-be-4-5-times-costlier-than-the-new-one/articleshow/105910637.cms,11-12-2023,"Any move by states to shift to the old
pension
scheme (
OPS
) would raise their fiscal burden by 4.5 times their expenditure under the
NPS
retirement benefits, according to the Reserve bank of India estimates made in study of state government budgets.
“ Internal estimates suggest that if all the State governments revert to OPS from the National Pension System (NPS), the cumulative fiscal burden could be as high as 4.5 times that of NPS, with the additional burden reaching 0.9 per cent of GDP annually by 2060” said the report titled “ State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2023-24” released on Monday.
These estimates assume significance as a few state governments, mostly from the opposition parties in the centre, have made electoral promises of returning to the
old pension system
. This will add to the pension burden of older OPS retirees whose last batch is expected to retire by early 2040s and, therefore, draw pension under the OPS till the 2060s.
“To start with, the return to the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) by a few States and reports of some other States moving in the same direction
would exert a huge burden on State finances and restrict their capacity to undertake growth enhancing capital expenditures”, the report said. “ Thus, any reversion to OPS by the States will be a major step backwards, undermining the benefits of past reforms and compromising the interest of future generations”
Live Events
Going forward, there is a need for scaling up fiscal capacity for uninterrupted and efficient delivery of social, economic and general services to the people and for upgrading the quality of physical and human capital,
RBI
said.
GST implementation has led to greater formalisation of the economy.
And it is important from the point of view of expanding the tax base, without unduly raising the tax burden. The central bank has also called for Improvement in tax administration, including data analytics to curb tax evasion, which will likely augment the fiscal capacity of the States.

Asked if there could be a cut in taxes on petrol and diesel, the official said the prices of brent crude have already cooled in the international markets and there is no case for a cut in excise duty on
fuel
.
India is dependent on imports to meet nearly 85 per cent of its oil needs and so benchmarks local fuel rates to international oil prices.
""When crude oil prices were high, we cut excise duty. When prices have already cooled, the question of tax cut is not there. You can ask for price cut (of petrol and diesel), but it will not be because of cut in taxes,"" the official said.
Brent crude prices stood at USD 76.40 a barrel in the futures market early on Monday.
Excise duty on fuel was last cut in May 2022 to cool inflation. The central excise duty on petrol was then cut by Rs 8 per litre and on diesel by Rs 6 per litre.

Among those choosing long-term investment plans and sticking to the old regime, provident fund investments continue to be the most popular, followed by life insurance and life insurance instruments.

"Centre seeks house approval for extra net spending of Rs 58,378 cr",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-seeks-house-approval-for-extra-net-spending-of-rs-58378-cr/articleshow/105792463.cms,07-12-2023,"New Delhi: The government on Wednesday sought parliamentary approval for an additional net spending of ₹58,378 crore in the first batch of supplementary demand for grants in this financial year. Despite the additional outgo, officials expect the government to meet its
fiscal deficit
target of 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2023-24.
The demands involve gross additional spending of more than ₹1.29 lakh crore in this fiscal, a significant chunk of which, ₹70,968 crore, will be met through savings or enhanced receipts of various ministries and departments, according to the papers tabled in both houses of
Parliament
.
Late last month, officials had said overall
revenue collections
were expected to remain robust this fiscal, while additional outgo under some programmes or heads could be significantly offset by savings in others and reprioritisation of expenditures.
The
Centre
's fiscal deficit in the first seven months of this fiscal hit 45% of the full-year target, a tad lower from 45.6% a year before, indicating that the deficit was under control.
ET Bureau
Live Events
The government had budgeted total expenditure at ₹45 lakh crore for 2023-24, while its tax and non-tax revenue was pegged at ₹26.3 lakh crore.
The net outgo under the first batch of supplementary demands for grants in 2023-24 is way below the level a year before, when the government had sought clearance for a net spending of ₹3.26 lakh crore and gross expenditure of ₹4.36 lakh crore.
However, this was because the 2022-23
budget
calculations went haywire after the Ukraine war broke out unexpectedly, leading to elevated global commodity prices that inflated the government's
subsidy
bill.
The latest supplementary demands include a total of 79 grants and four appropriations. They were tabled in the Lok Sabha by minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary.
A large part of the proposed net cash outgo includes additional spending on fertiliser subsidy (₹ 13,351 crore), transfer to the external affairs ministry's Guarantee Redemption Fund (₹9,014 crore) and food subsidy and related items (₹5,589 crore).
The government has also proposed additional spending (gross) on the
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
or NREGS (₹16,143 crore), LPG connection to poor households (₹8,500 crore), optical fibre control network of defence services and capital infusion into BSNL ( ₹7,722 crore), and Centre's investment in various insurance companies (₹6,973 crore).
However, these additional expenditure commitments are being met through savings under various expenditures heads.
The extra NREGS outgo includes ₹10,000 crore released by the

"About 33,000 notices sent by CBIC officers for discrepancies in GST returns filed in FY18, FY19",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/about-33000-notices-sent-by-cbic-officers-for-discrepancies-in-gst-returns-filed-in-fy18-fy19/articleshow/105785019.cms,06-12-2023,"Central tax officers have sent around 33,000
GST
notices to businesses for discrepancies in returns filed and short payment of taxes in 2017-18 and 2018-19 financial years, a CBIC official said on Wednesday. The National Co-ordination Committee of the State and Central GST officers, chaired by the Revenue Secretary, is likely to be held by the end of this month or early January, which among other things would also sensitise tax officers regarding issuance of notices, the official said.
Speaking at the Assocham National Conference on GST, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and
Customs
(CBIC) Member-GST Shashank Priya said the notices sent for 2017-18 and 2018-19 were a ""small percentage"" of the total returns filed for the two fiscal years.
He said the bunching up of demand notices was also on account of extension in the deadline given to taxpayers for filing annual returns for the two years.
Goods and Services Tax
(GST) was rolled out on July 1, 2017.
The last date for filing annual returns for 2017-18 fiscal was extended till February 7, 2020, while for 2018-19 it was till December 2020.
Under the GST law, every registered person is liable to file annual return for every financial year on or before December 31 of the next financial year. Accordingly, the last date of filing annual return for 2022-23 fiscal is December 31, 2023.

""At the request of the taxpayers the time for return filing was postponed. So returns also were filed at a late juncture and officers have come under a lot of pressure (to scrutinise the returns). So this has led to this unfortunate situation. One hopes that as we progress forward this situation gets addressed and we will not have all the proposed notices pending at the same time. For 2017-18, it has happened like that and we will see how best to deal with it,"" Priya said.
The Central GST officers have sent around 30,000-33,000 notices to GST registered businesses for short-payment of taxes, he said.
""In our interaction with the field formations, we will try to sensitise them that they should put their officers on alert, they should do a critical scrutiny of details, documents, facts given by the registrants before coming to a conclusion and passing an order. I'm sure, we will take up this issue in the
National Coordination Committee
meeting so that all tax administrations are sensitised,"" Priya said.
These disputes, he said, if are resolved out at the level of adjudicating authority, instead of approaching the GST appellate tribunal, would be a relief both for the tax administration as well as taxpayers.
""We are working on automated scrutiny module that would give certainty on how scrutiny is to be done and what kind of issues will be looked into return scrutiny,"" Priya said.
Further, the officer said the GST appellate tribunal would be put in place in the next 4-5 months and efforts are also being made to identify infrastructure, following which selection process of members will start.
With regard to curbing fake registration under GST, Priya said in many tax administration, about 25-28 per cent of the businesses registered were found to be fake.
""We are looking at how we further tighten the registration. We are also looking at how we make it less and less open for changing the GSTR-3B (monthly GST payment form),"" he said.
The Central and State GST officers have detected 21,791 fake GST registrations and over Rs 24,000 crore of suspected tax evasion during a two-month-long special drive from May 16 to July 15, 2023, to weed out bogus registrations.
""A total of 21,791 entities (11,392 entities pertaining to state tax jurisdiction and 10,399 entities pertaining to CBIC jurisdiction) having GST registration were discovered to be non-existent. An amount of Rs 24,010 crore (state - Rs 8,805 crore + Centre - Rs 15,205 crore) of suspected tax evasion was detected during the special drive,""
Finance
Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had informed the
Parliament
.
The National Co-ordination Committee of the State and Central GST officers in its last meeting on April 24, 2023, had decided to launch the special drive to detect suspicious/ fake
GSTINs
and to conduct requisite verification and further remedial action to weed out these fake billers from the GST eco-system and to safeguard government revenue.

Centre’s debt estimated to drop to 57.2% of GDP in FY24: MoS finance,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centres-debt-estimated-to-drop-to-57-2-of-gdp-in-fy24-mos-finance/articleshow/105759078.cms,05-12-2023,"The
Central
government’s debt is estimated to moderate to 57.2% of
gross domestic product
(
GDP
) in FY24 from 61.5% in FY21 when pandemic-related spending to provide succour to people and businesses led to a spike in its loan profile, the
finance ministry
said on Tuesday.
Minister of state for finance
Pankaj Chaudhary
, in a written reply in the
Rajya Sabha
, stressed that the risk profile of the debt “stands out as safe and prudent in terms of accepted parameters of an indicator-based approach for debt sustainability”. The government debt is held predominantly (about 95%) in the domestic currency, he said, seeking to assuage fears of forex risks.
Chaudhary said per capita debt of the central government rose to Rs 58,709 as of March 2023 from Rs 29,127 in March 2012. He, however, added that the debt-to-GDP ratio (of the central government) is a “better measure to reflect debt burden in the country”.
The government, the minister asserted, has initiated a number of measures to keep the debt at a reasonable level, which include “delicately balancing the need for broad-based and sustained economic revival and fiscal consolidation”. It has pledged to reduce the
fiscal deficit
to a level below 4.5% of the GDP by FY26; it had hit 9.2% in the pandemic year of FY21 and is estimated to drop to 5.9% in FY24.
“Increasing the buoyancy of
tax revenue
through improved compliance, improving efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure, and augmenting productive efficiency of the economy, among others, are the important measures taken by the Government to bring down the debt and strengthen the economy,” Chaudhary said.
Live Events
The central government's debt-to-GDP ratio had dropped to 52.3% in FY19 from 53.5% in 2011-12, before spiking in the wake of the pandemic due to “measures taken by the government to provide relief to the vulnerable sections of society and also due to decline in
revenue
generation during the time of COVID-19 pandemic”, the minister said.

's
gross foreign direct investment
(
FDI
) inflows dropped almost 16% in the first six months of FY24 from a year before to $33.12 billion, the second straight fall in the first half of a fiscal, the
Rajya Sabha
was informed on Tuesday.
In a written reply, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the inflow have been impacted by the ""threat of global recession, economic crisis due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, global protectionist measures and decline of real GDP growth rates of Singapore, USA and UK which are the major source countries for FDI"".
FDI equity inflows, too, eased nearly 24% in the first half of this fiscal to $20.49 billion, he said.
Gross FDI typically includes FDI equity, reinvested earnings, equity capital of unincorporated bodies and other capital.
The
FDI inflows
into a country hinge on a raft of factors, such as the availability of natural resources, macro-economic stability, investment decision of foreign investors, global investment climate and central bank interest rates, Chaudhary added.

The 2-Factor authentication is an additional security system to protect the GST account of taxpayers from any misuse in addition to the username and password for logging in to the system.
This is linked with the registered mobile number of the taxpayer and a One Time Password (OTP) is generated and sent to the mobile number. The OTP can be sent to a registered mobile number as SMS or through Sandes app, which is a messaging app provided by the government so that taxpayers can send and receive messages.
Apart from that the taxpayers can use the ‘NIC-GST-Shield’ app, which is a mobile app provided by e-wayBill or e-Invoice System, so that OTP can be generated by using the app.
The centre has made the two-factor authentication mandatory for all GST taxpayers who have an annual Aggregate Turnover of Rs 100 crores and above from July 15. Later the threshold was reduced to Rs 20 crore. Now it will be mandatory for all the taxpayers which are registered under GST.

When asked about the plan to extend the scheme for sectors like toys, the official said: ""It will be decided after a review of the scheme. We are taking stock and what is the progress so far. The progress is better in some, and in some sectors, changes are required. So an inter-ministerial consultation is on.""
Till March this year, incentives worth Rs 2,900 crore have been disbursed under the Rs 1.98 lakh crore PLI scheme.
An additional Rs 1,000 crore incentives for this year has been granted for companies engaged in electronics manufacturing.
PLI schemes for sectors such as electronics, mobile manufacturing, pharma and food processing are doing well while in some sectors like textiles, certain course correction is expected.
The scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors such as telecommunications, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell battery, drones and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.
PLI schemes for sectors which are not picking up well include advanced chemistry cell (
ACC
) batteries, textile products and speciality steel.
The government is trying to sort out issues such as timely processing of claims, visa-related matters where vendors require Chinese professionals' expertise, and delay in getting environmental clearances that have been raised by the stakeholders of the schemes.
The purpose of the schemes is to attract investments in key sectors and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiency and bring economies of size and scale in the manufacturing sector; and make Indian companies and manufacturers globally competitive.

Cayman Islands
and
Cyprus
contracted significantly during April-September this fiscal as the
overall inflows
declined by 24 per cent, according to the government data.
FDI
from Cayman Islands dipped 75 per cent to USD 145 million during April-September from USD 582 million in the same period last fiscal, the data showed.
Similarly, inflows from Cyprus contracted by over 95 per cent to USD 35 million during the six-month period as against USD 764 million in April-September 2022-23.
Experts have attributed the sharp fall in FDI from Cyprus and Cayman Islands to a hightened scrutiny of applications.
Anjali
Malhotra
, Partner - Regulatory,
Nangia Andersen India
said FDI inflows from other tax havens such as Singapore, and the
UAE
have also lost their sheen along with Cayman Islands and Cyprus during first half of 2023-24.
""...the recent decline in investment from Cayman Islands and Cyprus may be attributed to enhanced scrutiny of these investments,"" Malhotra said adding the recent decline in investment from tax havens is also in line with an overall fall in FDI during first half of 2023-24.
Live Events
The reason for overall decline may be attributed to increased interest rates owing to high inflation in the US and other western nations exacerbated by geo-political situations in Eastern Europe and
West Asia
, she said.
Sanjay Kumar, Partner,
Deloitte India
, said it is worth noting that the overall FDI outflow from Cyprus to the world has been declining at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 62 per cent.
For Cayman Islands, Kumar said that in October this year, the region was removed from the grey list by FATF (Financial Action Task Force) and this may result into positive FDI flow from Cayman Islands in coming times.
FDI into India declined 24 per cent to USD 20.48 billion in April-September 2023-24, dragged by lower inflows in computer hardware and software, telecom, auto and pharma.

Bankers are hoping that new faces at both the parent and IDRCL will quicken the pace of bad loan resolution.
NARCL is running behind schedule owing to delays in government guarantee renewal, lack of consensus with banks on the best price for assets, and over differences between NARCL and its primary agent IDRCL.
So far, NARCL has concluded the acquisition of just six companies since it started operations in January 2022. Total debt acquired by NARCL stands at '14,166 crore, a far cry from the '82,845-crore target set by SBI chairman Dinesh Khara in January 2022, of which, '50,335 crore was to be transferred by the end of 2021-22.
NARCL acquires
bad loans
from banks by paying 15% of the amount in cash and the rest in security receipts, which are to be matched with recovery over time. These security receipts are guaranteed by the government, valid for five years, to be invoked by banks in case of resolution or liquidation of bad loan.

"GST collections for November at 1.68 lakh cr, up 15% YoY",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-collections-for-november-at-1-68-lakh-cr-up-15-yoy/articleshow/105661780.cms,02-12-2023,"India’s goods and services tax (GST) collections rose 15% in November to Rs 1.68 lakh crore, driven by festive demand and improved compliance.
The collection was lower than Rs 1.72 lakh crore collected last month, the GST collections was highest in April this fiscal at Rs 1.87 lakh crore.
The monthly revenue crossed Rs 1.60 lakh crore for the sixth time in the current fiscal year and ninth month in a row that the monthly GST mop-up has come in above the Rs 1.5 lakh crore mark.
The gross
GST collection
till November stood at Rs 13.32 lakh crore.
Live Events
”The consistent growth in GST collections is a big cheer for the Indian economy and to an extent signifies resilience of the economy to various global challenges,"" Abhishek Jain, Partner & National Head, Indirect Tax, KPMG says.
He added that festive sales, settlement of disputes against notices issued, etc. could be some underlying reasons for higher collections in November.
Average gross monthly GST collection in FY 2023-24 now stands at Rs 1.66 lakh crore.
""The upward trend in GST collections continues as expected on the back of festive seasons and further increase in audits and investigations and this trend is likely to continue for the remainder of this fiscal as well,"" Pratik Jain, Partner, PwC India said.
Of the total collections, central GST (CGST) is Rs 30,420 crore, state GST (SGST) is Rs 38,226 crore, Integrated GST (IGST) is Rs 87,009 crore, including Rs 39,198 crore collected on import of goods.
During the month, the revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) are 20% higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year.
"" The numbers can be said to be an indicator of stable Indian economy as we see 20% increase in domestic transactions compared to the same month last year,"" Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY said.
The cess collections stood at Rs 12,274 crore, including Rs 1,036 crore collected on import of goods.
The robust growth in GST was seen in most of the manufacturing states, indicative of uplift in demand and consumption.
“It is heartening to see that the major producing and consuming states depict a growth exceeding 16% compared to the same period last year,"" MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte India said.
He added that the stability shown in the GST collections would give the policy makers the confidence to move ahead with the next phase of GST reforms.
The government has settled Rs 37,878 crore to CGST and Rs 31,557 crore to SGST from IGST.
“The total revenue of Centre and the States in the month of November, 2023 after regular settlement is Rs 68,297 crore for CGST and Rs 69,783 crore for the SGST,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.
""The healthy growth in GST collections is enthusing although it may partly reflect the later onset of the festive season this year,"" Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist
ICRA
said.
Rating agency ICRA had predicted that the overall collection for FY24 is likely to cross budgeted estimates.
The indirect tax revenue target for the current fiscal is Rs 15.37 lakh crore out of which the Centre has budgeted Rs 9.57 lakh crore from GST collections, which includes CGST, centre's share in IGST, and GST compensation cess.

Credit metrics of India Inc likely to improve to 4.5-5 times in Q3 FY24: Icra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/credit-metrics-of-india-inc-likely-to-improve-to-4-5-5-times-in-q3-fy24-icra/articleshow/105661211.cms,01-12-2023,"India Inc
's credit metrics are likely to show slight sequential improvement in the third quarter of the current fiscal, with interest coverage increasing to 4.5-5 times, rating agency
Icra
said on Friday. This would benefit from improved earnings of
corporate India
on the back of continuing, albeit moderating, tailwinds from commodity prices and seasonally strong demand during the recently concluded festive season, it said in a release.
Icra's analysis of the second quarter of 2023-24 performance of 601 listed companies (excluding financial sector entities) revealed improved operating profit margins (OPM), increasing by 398 bps and 64 bps on a year-on-year and sequential basis, respectively, it said.
This was primarily aided by softening in commodity prices. However, while the input costs softened in recent months, they remain elevated compared to the historic levels, and accordingly, India Inc's OPM is yet to revive to its historic highs, the agency said.
""The 1.6 per cent year-on-year (YoY) and 0.1 per cent sequential revenue growth for corporate India in Q2 FY2024 was supported by steady demand. However, the YoY revenue expansion was curtailed to an extent due to a general decline in the realisation levels amidst softening of input costs for most of the sectors,"" said
Kinjal Shah
, Vice President and Co-Group Head - Corporate Ratings,
Icra Limited
.
The agency said improvement in earnings coupled with a pause in rate hikes by the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Committee in the recent past (thereby restricting the upward movement in finance cost), led to year-on-year improvement in interest coverage ratio to 4.5 times for the second quarter of 2023-24 from 3.9 times in the corresponding period of 2022-23 for Icra's sample set companies.
Live Events
However, it remained flattish on a sequential basis.
An expected revival in earnings coupled with a pause on rate hike is likely to result in an improvement in India Inc's interest coverage to 4.5-5.0 times in the third quarter of FY24, although inflationary trends remain monitorable in the long run, Icra said.

State indebtedness to stay high at 31-32% in FY24: Crisil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/state-indebtedness-to-stay-high-at-31-32-in-fy24-crisil/articleshow/105650386.cms,01-12-2023,"A rise in balance sheet borrowings and guarantees to power and irrigation sector entities is likely to keep state indebtedness high at 31-32%, said Crisil in its latest report Friday.
The rating agency noted that overall borrowings of 18 states, which constitute 90% of the country’s gross state domestic product, is likely to increase by 9% to over Rs 87 lakh crore in FY24 compared with Rs 79.5 lakh crore in FY23.
“The revenue deficit will inch up to 0.5% of GSDP this fiscal from 0.3% last fiscal. This, coupled with the 18-20%3 on-year increase in capital outlays of states (~2.3% of GSDP) on key infrastructure segments such as water supply & sanitation, urban development, roads, and irrigation, will necessitate higher borrowings this fiscal, too,” said Anuj Sethi, senior director, Crisil Ratings.
States, however, will be able to meet their fiscal deficit target, with Crisil projecting that at 2.5% of GSDP, the gross fiscal deficit will remain below the 3% Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act mark.
State development loan borrowing, which accounts for 65% of the overall state borrowing, was 28% higher between April and November 2023.

“The 50-year interest-free loans for Rs 1.3 lakh crore from the Centre to states will help meet part of the capital outlay and catalyse investments. Moreover, this loan is not included in the borrowing limit of ~3% of GSDP for states this fiscal,” said Crisil.
The debt to GSDP ratio hit a high of 34% in FY21 after remaining around 28-29% in the pre-pandemic period.
The debt target for states and Centre under the FRBM is 20% and 40%, respectively.
Crisil noted that the revenue expenditure growth at 8-10%, “driven by higher committed expenditure, and increasing social welfare and public health-related expenses,” was likely to be higher than revenue growth of 6-8%.
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in its latest economic outlook, had suggested a greater need for states to control their spending and narrow the tax gap.
“Better-than-expected tax buoyancy or support from the centre in the form of higher grants could provide further liquidity buffer to states,” Crisil said.

"Five years since 2018 UP Investors Summit: Half of investment pledged translated into proposals, 3.24 lakh jobs created",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/five-years-since-2018-up-investors-summit-half-of-investment-pledged-translated-into-proposals-3-24-lakh-jobs-created/articleshow/105649143.cms,01-12-2023,"Nearly half of the total Rs 4.28 lakh crore worth of investment pledged in the Investor Summit held by the
Yogi
government in 2018 translated into investment proposals over the last five years, generating 3.24 lakh jobs, the government said in a replies in the legislative assembly on Thursday, adding that more than 61% of the investment proposed has begun to see commercial production.
Operations began in 843 projects generating 3.24 lakh jobs, it said.
In Yogi government's maiden Investor Summit held in 2018, 1045 MoUs (memorandums of understanding) worth Rs 4.28 lakh crore were signed between various companies and the state government. The government followed the Investor Summit with three 'groundbreaking ceremonies' in 2018, 2019 and 2022. According to information provided, Rs 2.09 lakh crore worth of investment out of the Rs 4.28 lakh pledged investment could be formalised through the three GBCs, out of which investment to the tune of Rs 1.28 lakh crore or 61% of the investment proposed has begun commercial production
The breakup of the figures was contained in the replies made by minister of state of industrial development Jaswant Singh Saini, to two questions asking the number of companies that participated in the three GBCs and the amount of investment that has been made as well as employment generated. Saini said in the first GBC, an investment proposal of Rs 61,7902 crore was made by 66 industrial units out of which Rs 42,581 crore worth of investment has begun commercial production. 1.14 lakh jobs were created by the 66 projects. In the second GBC, an investment proposal of Rs 67,202 crore was made by 257 units out of which investment worth Rs 54,903 has started commercial production with the projects generating 70,033 jobs. In the last GBC, an investment proposal worth Rs 80,224 crore was made by 520 companies out of which investment worth Rs 31,142 crore has begun commercial production with a total of 1,39,396 jobs having been created by the companies.
For the Yogi Adityanath led UP government, roping in a higher amount of investments is part of its good governance claim and a validation of its firm grip on the law and order situation. In the Investor Summit held in 2023, the government claimed it had received investment proposals worth about Rs 33 lakh crore which held the potential of creating more than 90 lakh jobs in the state.

Cash may still be king despite pick up in digital transactions,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cash-may-still-be-king-despite-pick-up-in-digital-transactions/articleshow/105568577.cms,28-11-2023,"Even as post COVID pick up in
digital transactions
has slowdown the demand for cash in the country, a research paper by
RBI economists
says that cash is still a preferred as savings instrument for its 'store of value' and for precautionary purposes and hence demand for cash would rise as the economy grows the paper said.
“This paper finds that the sustained growth in
currency demand
is influenced by the precautionary and store-of-value motives, while the use of cash as a payment medium continues to fall” say Sakshi Awasthy, Rekha Misra and Sarat Dhal in a paper titled “ Cash versus
Digital Payment Transactions
in India: Decoding the Currency Demand Paradox” published in its latest volume of “Occasional Papers” . The views however are that of the authors and not that of the central bank.
The lower return on alternative investments (or negative real return) during the period prior to 2022-23 might have translated into increased demand for non-interest-bearing assets like currency. Notably, while the share of currency in M3 has witnessed a steady fall since 1951-52, it has exhibited faster growth than total deposits during periods of crisis and major policy shifts.
Also, in line with the global evidence, the pandemic led to a transitory uptick in currency demand in India driven primarily by precautionary and store-of-value motives, th epaper said.
The precautionary behaviour in cash usage is also evident from the excess financial savings of households, which rose to 15.5 per cent of the
Gross National Disposable Income
(GNDI) in 2020-21 from 11.7 per cent a year ago. The analysis also suggests that for transaction purposes cash is being increasingly substituted by digital means.
Live Events
In addition to being a medium of transaction, cash serves as a hedge against uncertain periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which are marked by an increased demand for cash driven by
precautionary motives
. Empirical evidence indicates that precautionary variables increase currency demand.
Overall, it is seen that digital payments are substituting the transactional demand for cash, but the store-of-value motive of holding cash remains intact, the paper said.

"India braces for a Rs 50,000 crore rise in its subsidy bill for FY24",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-braces-for-a-rs-50000-crore-rise-in-its-subsidy-bill-for-fy24/articleshow/105545237.cms,28-11-2023,"New Delhi:
India
's overall
subsidy bill
may surge by ₹50,000 crore this fiscal year because of increased expenditure on
fertiliser
,
cooking gas
and
food security
.
The government expects to meet this higher spending from savings under other heads in its ₹45-lakh crore FY24 budget.
Subsidy outgo for FY24 had been budgeted at ₹4.03 lakh crore, but may shoot up to ₹4.53 lakh crore. However, even this stretched welfare spend would be far less than the previous fiscal's
subsidy
bill of ₹5.62 lakh crore.
""There will be ₹50,000 crore additional outgo towards the subsidy bill in the revised estimates on account of higher food, fertiliser and LPG subsidy...But it would be met out of savings in spending on other heads,"" a senior government official told ET.
The fertiliser subsidy may see the sharpest rise - by ₹25,000 crore from ₹175,100 crore budgeted for FY24. Food and cooking gas subsidies could increase by ₹15,000 crore and ₹10,000 crore, respectively.

The official said the overall outgo, though higher, was still at a comfortable level.
""We have enough headroom and this is certainly much lower than the revised estimate last year, as we had been able to plug leakages in fertiliser subsidy,"" said the official cited earlier.
In FY23, the Centre budgeted Rs 1.05 lakh crore for fertiliser subsidy, which was revised to Rs 2.54 lakh crore, amid a sharp rise in fertiliser prices due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
Extension of the cooking gas subsidy to Rs 300 per cylinder to about 96 million low-income households, ahead of assembly elections in five states, has already inflated the LPG subsidy bill. The Centre, which had provisioned Rs 2,257 crore for LPG subsidy this fiscal year, will seek an additional Rs 10,000 crore in the supplementary
demand
for grants itself, in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament.
The food subsidy, which reached Rs 2.87 lakh crore in FY23, has been pegged at Rs 1.97 lakh crore this fiscal. However, higher procurement costs and extension of the free foodgrain scheme may add Rs 15,000 crore to the overall bill this fiscal year.

Modi's nudge: What a 'Vocal for Local' call for weddings of the rich means for economy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/modis-nudge-what-a-vocal-for-local-call-for-weddings-of-the-rich-means-for-economy/articleshow/105529829.cms,27-11-2023,"By now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'nudge' strategy has become quite well-known. The Economic Survey 2018 19 had highlighted how Modi had used ""behavioural economics of nudge"" for desired social and economic impacts. The “nudge” policies, which are used to change people’s mindset, gently steer them towards desirable behaviour even while preserving their liberty to choose. The Survey had mentioned how the Swachh Bharat Mission and the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao schemes had successfully employed the behavioural theory of nudge.
Modi gave another nudge in his
Mann Ki Baat
radio broadcast on Sunday. He said he was troubled by the trend of some ""big families"" conducting weddings abroad, and urged people to hold such celebrations on Indian soil so that the country's money does not leave its shores. “We have seen a direct example of this during this festive season. Last month in 'Mann Ki Baat' I had laid emphasis on '
Vocal for Local
' i.e. buying local products. Within the last few days, business worth more than Rs 4 lakh crore has been done in the country on Diwali, Bhaiya Dooj and Chhath,” he said.
Modi's nudge to the rich and famous to prefer local destinations to foreign ones for weddings is a significant ploy to boost India's economy because weddings mean mega business in India. Indians, of all classes, are known to splurge on weddings. Modi said some estimates suggest that there could be a business of around Rs 5 lakh crore during this wedding season.
No doubt, given India's huge
wedding economy
, a preference for local destinations will prove to be a huge boost.
India's $51 billion wedding economy
Live Events
Traditionally a big economic event, the Indian wedding season is getting hotter now. A colossal surge in demand is seen with the commencement of the wedding season on November 23.
After consultations with trade bodies and stakeholders across 30 cities, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has predicted a substantial economic surge. With an estimated 38 lakh weddings expected to take place across the country, the mainline retail sector, encompassing goods and services, anticipates a staggering business worth Rs 4.74 lakh crore ($51 billion), as per CAIT. This marks a significant increase from last year's trade, which amounted to Rs 3.75 lakh crore for approximately 32 lakh weddings during the same period.
In the realm of goods, the estimated trade distribution includes 10 per cent in textiles, sarees, lehnga, and garments, 15 per cent in jewellery articles, 5 per cent in electronics, electricals, and consumer durables, 5 per cent in dry fruits, fruits, sweets, and nankeen, 5 per cent in food grain, grocery, and vegetables, 4 per cent in gift items, and the remaining 6 per cent in miscellaneous items.
The services sector is also expected to flourish, with allocations of 5 per cent for banquet halls, hotels, and other marriage venues, 5 per cent for event management, 12 per cent for tent decoration, 10 per cent for catering services, 4 per cent for flower decoration, 3 per cent for travel and cab services, 2 per cent for photo and video shoots, 3 per cent for orchestra and band services, 3 per cent for lights and sound, and the remaining 3 per cent for miscellaneous services.
The economics of destination weddings
India has one of the fastest growing numbers of individuals with a net worth of $100 million or more. India's billionaire population rose to 161 in 2022 from 145 in the previous year and is estimated to rise to 195 individuals by 2027, according to a Knight Frank study. The number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals in India, having net worth of over $30 million, fell 7.5 per cent last year to 12,069 but will rise to 19,119 in the next five years, growing by more than 58 per cent
The Indian high-net-worth individual (HNI) population, with asset value of $1 million and more, increased to 7,97,714 last year from 7,63,674 in 2021. The number of HNIs will rise to 16,57,272 by 2027.
These rich and famous of India are being lured by foreign countries for exotic destination weddings, For example, Turkiye said in a press release last month that the destination had emerged as one of the most popular countries for destination weddings of Indian couples. Thailand and Bali are already popular foreign destinations for
Indian weddings
. Recently, Thailand announced a visa-free entry for Indians, and so did Sri Lanka and Malaysia. A visa-free entry is a big incentive for Indians holding destination weddings abroad as they have to fly hundreds of guests to the destination which involves a lot of visa-related paperwork in advance which becomes a big hassle for wedding planners already hassled by so many other things.
Thailand hopes to tap into ""pent-up demand"" from the multi-billion dollar Indian wedding industry, Tourism Authority of Thailand deputy governor Siripakorn Cheawsamoot told Reuters in an interview in August. ""Data from the last two years showed that many Indian couples got married, but couldn't find honeymoon locations ... or held back on getting married because they wanted to have their reception overseas including in Thailand,"" he said. About 60% of Indian destination weddings in Thailand were those of residents of India, while the remainder were from overseas Indian families, he said. Thai tourism representatives in Mumbai and New Delhi are expanding partnerships with wedding planners.
A two-day destination wedding in a five-star hotel at a top-tier Indian location for 200 guests can cost $365,706 to $609,510, ET has reported. For a wedding held at a foreign destination the amount would easily more than double.
Besides Bali, Thailand and Sri Lanka, other popular countries for Indian destination weddings are Dubai, Portugal, Italy and Oman. Paris, Budapest, and Rome, Lake Como, Tuscany and the Amalfi Coast, all in Italy, are some of the popular locales in Europe for Indian destination weddings.
The cost explodes when Indian couples seek landmark hotels and unique venues beyond banquet halls and luxury hotels in foreign countries. ""For a destination wedding in Doha, one of the events was at the National Museum of Qatar, which is not an easy feat,"" Ketan Sawant, a founder of A New Knot, a luxury wedding and event planning company based in Mumbai, had told NYT recently.
The rise of an aspirational middle class in India means a huge number of Indians who are not rich but won't flinch from aping the rich to splurge on weddings. This class is willing to invest in SIPs or even take a loan for organising destination weddings. Add to them the newly risen rich class in small-town India. That makes a huge number of Indians who would like to hold weddings at foreign destinations. This means PM Modi's appeal to the rich and famous to hold destination weddings within India can translate into a big economic dividende by modifying a trend that has just begun.
If the rich and famous start holding their weddings at Indian destinations, this will also boost the local tourism infrastructure in a big way with a number of new venues coming up at popular destinations.

Kochi, often referred to as the commercial capital of Kerala, has witnessed rapid urbanization, making it one of

Despite nearly universal coverage, water availability in the city is characterized by intermittent supply, ranging from 5 to 24 hours a day, depending on the locality.
This has led to the common sight of tanker trucks delivering water to areas facing low water pressure and inadequate supply.

ADB's intervention comes against the backdrop of Kerala experiencing severe dry spells and droughts, notably in 2016, which severely impacted water availability.
As climate projections indicate increased variability in rainfall frequency and rising temperatures, ensuring reliable and safe water services is deemed a critical climate adaptation strategy.
Senior Urban Development Specialist Hikaru Shoji emphasizes the importance of providing quality water, highlighting its role in inclusive development, particularly impacting the health and well-being of vulnerable communities.
Shoji said, ""Kerala has experienced severe dry spells and droughts, with the latest and most distressing one in 2016 that affected the availability of water. As climate projections point to varying frequency of rainfall and rising temperature, provision of reliable and safe water services is a critical climate adaptation strategy"".
Shoji added, ""Access to quality water is a prerequisite for inclusive development as it affects the health and well-being of the population, especially in disadvantaged communities. Women, who are usually responsible for domestic work and care of family members, are directly affected by poor water access.""
The project aims to mitigate these challenges and enhance access to quality water, a vital element of inclusive development.
The ambitious project involves the rehabilitation and upgrade of five existing water treatment plants with a cumulative production capacity of 325 million litres per day (MLD).
Additionally, a new plant with a capacity of 190 MLD will be constructed. To minimize treated water loss during distribution, around 700 kilometres of pipes will be replaced, accompanied by the introduction of a real-time monitoring system.
Furthermore, approximately 146,000 water meters will be upgraded to high-quality and reliable meters.
One of the distinctive features of this initiative is the introduction of preventive maintenance and asset management practices through a long-term performance-based contract.
This encompasses the operation and maintenance of water distribution infrastructure, as well as rehabilitation and upgrading activities.
Recognizing the importance of institutional capacity, the project seeks to strengthen the
Kerala Water Authority
(KWA).
This involves the introduction of a mobile app for improved billing and collection, the development of a geographic information system-based maintenance management system, and the upgrading of the laboratory information system.
Technical and managerial staff at KWA will undergo comprehensive training to enhance their expertise in various aspects of water supply services.
In a bid to promote female employment in the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply systems, the project places a special focus on training initiatives.
Additionally, community awareness programs, involving active participation from women (50 per cent), will be conducted to improve knowledge on household supply, water audits, water quality, and hygiene.
Topics such as menstrual hygiene and waterborne diseases will be addressed to ensure a holistic approach to community engagement.
The Asian Development Bank, established in 1966 and owned by 68 members, has consistently championed the cause of sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region.
With a commitment to eradicating extreme poverty, ADB's endorsement of the Kochi water modernization project aligns with its broader goals of fostering prosperity, inclusivity, resilience, and sustainability.
As the city of Kochi embarks on this transformative journey towards water infrastructure modernization, the ADB-backed initiative emerges as a beacon of hope for improved living conditions, climate adaptation, and sustainable urban development.

The terms of reference will likely be notified ""soon"", the official added.
The Finance Commission is a constitutional body that determines the method and formula for distributing
tax proceeds
among the Centre and states. It suggests distribution of taxes and grants and works based on the terms of reference set by the finance ministry for a five-year period. The recommendation of the 16th Finance Commission will be applicable for the period from April 2026 to March 2031.
The government earlier this month appointed Ritwik Pandey, a 1998 batch IAS officer of the Karnataka cadre, as an officer on special duty at the advance cell of the Finance Commission.
The terms of reference could include consideration of climate issues while deciding distribution of funds among states keeping in view India's commitment to climate financing and to prepare states and cities to tackle future adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, the official said.
The 15th Finance Commission had allocated ₹54,770 crore under the National Disaster Relief Fund and ₹1.28 lakh crore for state disaster relief funds. The Centre's share in state disaster relief funds was ₹98,080 crore.
Improving the financial health of municipal bodies is part of the government's pending agenda.
The
Reserve Bank of India
, the
Department of Expenditure
and state finance commissions have repeatedly flagged inefficient fund utilisation as well as poor accounts and record keeping by some municipal bodies.
""The commission could be asked to look at conditions-based transfer to make fund utilisation by local bodies effective and transparent,"" the official added.
The total central grant to local governments is estimated to be ₹4.36 lakh crore for the 15th Finance Commission period (FY22-FY26), of which ₹2.36 lakh crore is earmarked for rural local bodies and ₹1.21 lakh crore for urban local bodies.
Another ₹70,051 crore is for health grants through local governments.

"After earning Rs 1,162 crore from scrap disposal, Centre plans to accelerate cleanliness drives: Jitendra Singh",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/after-earning-rs-1162-crore-from-scrap-disposal-centre-plans-to-accelerate-cleanliness-drives-jitendra-singh/articleshow/105364591.cms,20-11-2023,"New Delhi: The Centre has earned Rs 1,162 crore from
scrap disposal
during its special cleanliness drives and plans are afoot to further accelerate it with the help of the states, Union Minister of State for Personnel
Jitendra Singh
said on Monday. The cleanliness campaigns carried out at over four lakh sites have resulted in weeding out nearly 96.10 lakh files, including electronic files, besides freeing up 355.50 lakh square feet of space, which can house a huge shopping complex or a mall, he said.
""As much as Rs 1,162.49 crore has been earned through disposal of office scrap, including
e-waste
such as old computers and other electronic items. The cleanliness drive has become India's largest campaign for institutionalising 'swachata',"" Singh told PTI.
He said without spending a significant sum, the government has been able to earn so many crores of revenue through the cleanliness campaign, ""which, in my opinion, is a huge success"".
The revenue of Rs 1,162.49 crore was earned in the three special campaigns carried out by the central government during 2021 to 2023, the minister said.
Singh said Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
made a call for 'swachhta (cleanliness)' from the ramparts of Red Fort in his first Independence Day speech in 2014 and soon it turned into a mass movement.
Live Events
""We have seen tremendous improvement in the office space. There was a time when we had cluttered office spaces with huge piles of files. Through these campaigns, that typical image of the government office space is no longer a reality. The special cleanliness campaign is one big initiative out of several others being taken to improve the overall functioning of the government,"" he said.
Singh added that the Centre wants to make the cleanliness campaign a massive mass movement with the help of the state governments.
""We are in touch with the state governments. Some of the state governments, including Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, have already taken noteworthy initiatives in this regard. We expect more states to accelerate this drive to make wealth out of waste,"" he said.
Singh said the cleanliness campaigns have resulted in a healthier work environment and de-cluttered office spaces.
""Government offices have been modernised through the adoption of mechanical cleaning, digital initiatives and compactors for effective records management. Millions of citizens visiting government offices experience a healthier work environment and the adoption of digital portals has led to minimal office visits for them,"" he said.
Singh said the first edition of the special cleanliness drive covered around 6,154 office sites.
""The efforts to enhance the office space and minimise pendency were continued and regular review meetings held to sustain the efforts. The Special Campaign 2.0, held last year, covered around one lakh sites across the country,"" he said.
During the Special Campaign 3.0 this year, a saturation approach was adopted to cover all field/public-centric offices covering around 2.5 lakh sites.
""It alone helped in earning around Rs 556 crore of revenue through scrap disposal,"" the minister added.

Siddaramaiah
on Monday said the government would examine if it could park government funds in
cooperative banks
rather than in nationalised banks.
The CM made the remarks at the valedictory of the All-India Convention on Cooperation at Vijayapura, attended by his Cabinet colleagues.
Cooperative banks, the CM added, should be stable. Only then could they lend to farmers. “If farmers get timely loans, it will lead to better farm productivity.” Cooperative banks became stronger after his government waived farm loans of up to Rs 50,000 during his earlier stint as CM, and reimbursed them for that.
During his previous stint, the government gave loans of up to Rs 3 lakh at a subsidized 3% rate of interest, but his government was now giving interest free loans of up to Rs 5 lakh., Siddaramaiah said. The government should be able to give loans of up to Rs 15 lakh at 3% rate of interest, the CM said, while adding that he would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and NABARD to implement this.
Commenting on the drought in
Karnataka
, Siddaramaiah said 223 taluks out of 236 taluks were reeling under drought and urged the MPs to get the Centre to release funds.

Sahara
Group founder
Subrata Roy
last week, the government is exploring the legality of transferring the unclaimed funds lying in the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account to the Consolidated Fund of India, ET reported this week. As on March 31, the funds recovered from the Sahara Group and deposited in state-owned banks amounted to Rs 25,163 crore after pay outs to some claimants. With officials saying that the dedicated refund account under the Sebi had barely seen claimants coming forward after 11 years, here is an explainer on how a potential transfer of funds to the Centre could provide a breather for the government bond market, which has seen record supply over the past couple of years.
HOW MUCH WOULD THE SAHARA FUNDS IMPACT THE BOND MARKET?
If around Rs 25,000 crore worth of the unclaimed Sahara funds were to find their way to the government’s Consolidated Fund; assuming a corresponding decline in the quantum of money needed to be borrowed by the Centre, the impact on government bonds would not be large. According to the pattern of government borrowing for the current financial year, the Centre has issued a monthly average of bonds worth Rs 1.45 lakh crore over the past three months. In November, the government is scheduled to sell bonds worth Rs 1.29 lakh crore, with weekly sales averaging more than Rs 30,000 crore.

WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT BORROW?
Live Events
The Centre and the state governments borrow funds in order to bridge their fiscal deficits, or the shortfall between their revenues and their expenditures. Borrowing is done by issuing bonds which are purchased largely by institutional investors such as banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, foreign portfolio investors, and provident funds. There is a provision for retail investors to buy government bonds although the participation so far is subdued. According to RBI norms, Indian banks have to invest a certain portion of their deposits in government bonds as part of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio.
HOW MUCH DOES THE GOVERNMENT BORROW?
Till FY19, the central government’s gross market borrowing through bonds had never crossed the Rs 6 lakh crore mark. In the subsequent years, government borrowing surged due to the Centre’s efforts to spend more and revive slowing economic growth, particularly during the COVID crisis. From Rs 7.10 lakh crore announced in the Interim Budget for FY20, the Centre has announced a gross borrowing of Rs 15.43 lakh crore in FY24. This translates into a sharp increase in supply of government bonds.
ARE THERE CONCERNS OF MORE GOVERNMENT BORROWING?
One way in which a potential transfer of Sahara funds to the government could help the bond market would be by assuaging concerns of additional market borrowing. Over the past few years, the government has on occasion resorted to announcing extra market borrowing. The Centre has sometimes announced the same in December after taking stock of revenues. On other occasions, it has announced extra borrowing during the Budget on Feb 1. Given that 2023 is a pre-election year, some concerns do exist of the government stepping up spending on welfare schemes, which may need extra funding.
HOW DOES GOVERNMENT BORROWING IMPACT THE ECONOMY?
Yields on government bonds are the benchmarks used by corporations to determine the rate of interest that they must pay to investors for raising money through bonds. If government bond yields move higher, corporate entities must accordingly shell out more to garner funds through bonds, pushing up borrowing costs in the economy. Extra supply of government bonds typically leads to a rise in yields.

EPFO
.
EPFO has over 60 million subscribers and manages a corpus of more than Rs 18 lakh crore. Majority of the Covid claims were settled by the EPFO in three days to substantially reduce the financial shock on households since the outbreak of the pandemic.
As per the report, the retirement fund body disbursed Rs 17,106.17 crore in 2020-21 benefitting 6.92 million beneficiaries, Rs 19.126.29 crore in 2021-22 to 9.16 million beneficiaries and Rs 11,843.23 crore to 6.20 million beneficiaries in 2022-23.
The advance for Covid, which came into force with effect from March 28, 2020, saw 33 beneficiaries availing the advance in the four days of March 2020 amounting to Rs 0.06 crore.
Live Events
The government had in March 2020 notified amendments to the
EPF
Scheme, 1952 to provide for non-refundable advance to EPF members not exceeding the basic wages and dearness allowances for three months or up to 75% of the amount standing to member’s credit in the EPF account, whichever is less, in the event of outbreak of epidemic or pandemic.
As a result, employees working in establishments and factories across entire India, who were members of the EPF Scheme, 1952, were eligible for the benefits of non-refundable advance under the amended scheme which came into effect from March 28, 2020.
According to the EPFO, the facility enabled members to cope during the tough phase of the pandemic.
The central board of trustees of the EPFO, a tripartite body under the chairmanship of labour minister, is the apex decision-making body of the retirement savings body. An approval from the central board of trustees is required for all reports of the EPFO, before they are formally accepted by the government.
Besides, the government has spent Rs 5000 crore to reimburse 24% of the employee and employer contribution (12% each) at the outbreak of the pandemic to ensure nobody suffered due to loss of continuity in the EPFO contribution.
However, this was applicable to establishments with up to 100 employees and 90% of whom were earning under Rs 15,000 monthly wage.
It is estimated that 8 million employees benefited from the initiative which incentivized about 0.4 million establishments to continue their employees on their payrolls despite disruption.

The option of transferring the amount to the Consolidated Fund of India with a separate account for refunding investors could be explored, said an official.
""The dedicated refund account under Sebi has barely seen claimants coming forward 11 years after the judgement,"" the person said.
""Funds can be used for pro-poor programmes or any other public welfare,"" said another official, adding that this can be done while setting up a separate window for refunding investors and that the issue will be legally examined.
Sahara depositors
As of March 31 this year, the total amount recovered from the group and deposited in the state-run banks was ₹25,163 crore, after paying out ₹138 crore to 17,526 applications involving 48,326 accounts.
Earlier this year, following a Supreme Court decision in March, ₹5,000 crore was transferred to the
Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies
for disbursement against legitimate dues of genuine depositors of the
Sahara Group of Cooperative Societies
, and a dedicated portal was created for refunds.
According to the latest order, the amount shall be paid to the depositors of the Sahara Group of Cooperative Societies out of ₹5,000 crore at the earliest, but not later than nine months from the date of the order. The balance will be transferred to the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account.
Home and cooperatives minister Amit Shah in July launched the dedicated portal set up for Sahara depositors to facilitate the refund process.
The Sahara entities had raised the money through optionally fully convertible debentures. Sebi had said this was done without its permission and asked Sahara to refund depositors.

"Private capex yet to get broad-based, experts differ on next year’s trajectory",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/private-capex-yet-to-get-broad-based-experts-differ-on-next-years-trajectory/articleshow/105205135.cms,14-11-2023,"The revival in
private capex
is concentrated only in a few industries and is yet to get more broad-based, economists said.
Fixed asset investment
grew faster in the construction and consumer-facing sectors like
retail
,
finance
, and
consumer durables
than the average growth registered across 1,420 industries, showed an ET analysis of data compiled by
Bank of Baroda
.
Auto, power, and telecom were laggards, according to Bank of Baroda data, growing slower than the 7.1% growth registered across enterprises in the first half of FY23.
“It can be concluded that
investment
activity is not yet broad-based. It is in limited pockets. In terms of overall share, around 43% of the industries by size of fixed assets performed better than the average. Five major sectors, however, continue to trail, which includes power and telecom,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Bank of Baroda.
Investment intentions data also point to certain sectors taking the entire weight of the rise in private activity, the study noted.

“Data on investment intentions based on announcements is also not very encouraging as there is no broad-based picture revealed. 83% of such announcements came from transport, power and chemicals, with transport having a share of 57%,” Sabnavis noted.
The manufacturing activity survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry shows that capacity utilisation was higher for infrastructure and ancillary sectors compared with the national average of 74%.

(
ADB
) will extend a $400-million “policy-based loan” to the Indian government to support its urban reform agenda for creating quality urban infrastructure, improving service delivery and promoting efficient governance systems, the finance ministry said on Friday.
The agreement was signed on Friday between Juhi Mukherjee, joint secretary in the finance ministry and Takeo Konishi, the country director of ADB’s India Resident Mission. It deals with the “sub-programme 2 of the Sustainable Urban Development and Service Delivery programme”.
While the sub-programme 1, approved in 2021 with a financing of $350 million, established national-level policies and guidelines to improve urban services, the sub-programme 2 is supporting investment planning and reforms at the state and urban local body (ULB) levels, the ministry said.
The latest programme supports the Indian government’s urban sector strategy, with a focus on urban reforms that are aimed at making cities not just liveable but also centres of economic growth “through provisioning of inclusive, resilient and sustainable infrastructure”, according to the statement.
“Sub-programme 2 supports the reforms initiated by the states and the ULBs in operationalising the national flagship programme of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 targeted for universal access of water supply and sanitation,” Konishi said.

This sub-programme also supports other mission objectives for ensuring urban water security through reducing water losses, recycling treated sewage for non-domestic use, rejuvenation of water bodies, and maintaining sustainable ground water level, according to the statement.
“The programme also envisages integrated urban planning reforms to control urban sprawls and foster systemic and planned urbanisation through enhancing the entire ecosystem of legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms along with capacity building of ULBs and community awareness,” the ministry said in the statement.
Specifically, ULBs will promote the modernisation of building bylaws, land pooling and urban agglomeration, and comprehensive urban mobility planning to help cities emerge as centres of economic growth.
“Such integrated planning processes will incorporate climate and disaster resilience, promote nature-based solutions, improve urban environment, and improve cities’ financial sustainability through generation of additional revenues,” the ministry said.
Cities will also be incentivised to become creditworthy by undertaking various reforms for enhancing their revenues, including property taxes and user charges. They will also be encouraged to improve their efficiencies and rationalise their expenditures, according to the statement.

EPFO to run special recovery drive from December to February,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/epfo-to-run-special-recovery-drive-from-december-to-february/articleshow/105146547.cms,11-11-2023,"Hit by the increasing trend of slow recovery of dues from its subscribers, the
Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation
will initiate a special recovery drive for three months from December 2023 to February 2023 to augment recovery.
“The increasing trend of slow recovery of arrears of provident fund and allied dues has been a matter of great concern. So much so that performance in recovery of current and arrear dues is far below the targets fixed by the headquarters,” the
retirement
fund body
EPFO
said in a directive issued to its regional offices.
“In order to augment recovery, it has been decided that a special recovery drive is carried out for the months of December, January and February 2023 for both exempted and unexempted establishments,” it added.
According to the directive, seen by ET, the above actions are meant to be taken for meeting the objectives of speedy recovery of dues and not for any harassment of the employers or defaulters.
In the absence of recovery of dues from defaulting establishments, EPFO can initiate
recovery actions
such as attachment of movable and immovable properties, attachment of
bank
account, appointment of receiver and arrest of employer and detention.
Live Events
EPFO has also directed its zonal offices to submit weekly consolidated recovery reports on performance of regional offices during the special recovery drive.
Besides, it has asked its regional offices to ensure that all targets for recovery, as communicated to the head office, should be met during the special drive.
EPFO had in the past conducted such special recovery drives to recover its dues from defaulters through its regional offices.
EPFO has more than 60 million subscribers and manages a corpus of over Rs 12 lakh crore. Its beneficiaries are entitled to provident funds, pension, and insurance benefits under three different schemes of EPFO.

Centre losing revenue as crypto trading moves offshore,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-losing-revenue-as-crypto-trading-moves-offshore/articleshow/105091536.cms,09-11-2023,"A new study has revealed that nearly 90% of crypto currency trading in India has shifted to
offshore platforms
after the government levied 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on trading of virtual digital assets (VDAs) with effect from July 2022.
The study, by Delhi-based think-tank Esya Centre, found that over Rs 3,50,000 crore was traded by Indians on offshore platforms between July 2022 and July 2023, which is over 90% of total VDAs traded by Indians. This has deprived the exchequer of Rs 3,493 crore of revenue, as against the collected revenue of Rs 258 crore, because of offshore trades that are not TDS compliant.
This also means that billions of dollars of capital gains tax will not be collected on these trades conducted offshore. And, this does not even factor in private transactions or larger over-the-counter (OTC) trades.
“Data shows that two likely policy objectives of the tax—to curb speculation and create transparency around transactions—have not been achieved,” Vikash Gautam, adjunct fellow at Esya Centre, told ET. “There is an urgent need to reduce the TDS in particular to fix this to the benefit of the Indian economy and VDA investors/consumers.”
Over 3-5 million Indian users have shifted to offshore platforms since the TDS was announced in February 2022, with a single offshore exchange (read:
Binance
) reporting 450,000 sign ups in the month following its implementation in July 2022.

The Indian government introduced a 1% TDS on VDA transfers from July 1, 2022 along with a 30% capital gains tax on the profits earned from April 1, 2022. The announcement made in previous years’ budget speech marked the first official definition and recognition of crypto assets or the industry in Indian law. In addition to this, Indian virtual asset service providers (VASPs) are now included as reporting entities under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), entailing a penalty of up to seven years imprisonment for evading the tax levy.
However, the legal barricades did not deter Indian crypto traders to explore technological workarounds and circumvent the levy by signing up with offshore exchanges and transferring their trades.
“Given the borderless nature of VDAs and the ease with which anyone can set up a simple trading platform in any jurisdiction, the 1% TDS levy was bound to have distributional repercussions. That is, the 1% TDS on VDA trades led to an exodus of users, funds and trades to offshore VDA platforms,” the report said.
This is further exacerbated because of the ‘P2P (peer-to-peer) escrow’ services that these foreign players offer, which are an easy way for customers to move in and out of jurisdictions.
Users transfer INR directly to each other’s bank accounts, while the platform provides escrow services only for the custody and transfer of the VDA portion of each transaction. As of September 2023, seven of the top 10 VDA exchanges by revenue were offering P2P escrow services, with India ranking in the top five interactions with these, the report said.
Esya Center recommends that the government must clarify the applicability of TDS to offshore platforms and in the event of non-compliance with existing PMLA guidelines, besides lowering the tax to 0.01%.
Regulators must come up with an alternative reporting mechanism so that there is sufficient insight on fund flows. The government must authorise a body to blacklist and block non-compliant platforms.
“Registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) may act as an ‘official’ ad hoc licence to differentiate between 'onshore' and 'offshore' platforms,” it said.

Growth in October GST mop-up due to economic activity: CBIC chief Sanjay Kumar Agarwal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/growth-in-october-gst-mop-up-due-to-economic-activity-cbic-chief-sanjay-kumar-agarwal/articleshow/105075571.cms,08-11-2023,"NEW DELHI: The robust
goods and services tax
(
GST
) collection in October was driven by strong economic activities and improved compliances, and not by any mop-up from tax notices sent to online gaming companies, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (
CBIC
) chairman Sanjay Kumar
Agarwal
said on Wednesday.
Speaking on the sidelines of a CII event here, Agarwal also said the online gaming companies that have been served with the show-cause notices have time to respond, indicating that taxes in such cases don't flow in immediately.
In August 2023, the GST Council made it clear that all online games involving bets, regardless of skill or chance, would be subject to a 28% GST on the full value of the bets placed. It came into effect from October 1.
In recent weeks, some online companies have reportedly been served with GST notices involving tax incidence of about rs 1 lakh crore.
GST collections for October jumped 13% from a year before to Rs 1.72 lakh crore, the highest monthly mop-up since Rs 1.87 lakh crore for April.

Agarwal said a rise in integrated GST mop-up, on the back of higher imports, also drove up overall GST collections for October. ""The imports were healthier as compared to earlier months, maybe because companies are replenishing their stocks or inventories due to the advent of the festive season,"" he said. Asked if the government was considering fuel duty cuts ahead of state elections, Agarwal said excise duty changes in petroleum products are driven by global price movements and not by any revenue consideration.
He said: ""Excise duty is now levied mainly on petroleum products. It's calibrated, depending on the rates of the petroleum products that are prevailing in the international market.""
The CBIC chairman also called on businesses to rethink their demand for GST exemptions, saying such things adversely affect the entire
ITC
(input tax credit) system. Agarwal indicated that the CBIC may soon issue advisory to nudge businesses to strictly follow e-invoicing for business-to-business transactions under the GST regime.

India’s tax windfall gives Modi scope to spend more on welfare,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-tax-windfall-gives-modi-scope-to-spend-more-on-welfare/articleshow/105062442.cms,08-11-2023,"India
’s government is likely to exceed its
tax revenue
projections this year, giving Prime Minister Narendra
Modi
more fiscal room to spend on wooing rural voters ahead of elections.
Bloomberg Economics estimates the central government’s total receipts will be about 1.9 trillion rupees ($22.8 billion) above the budgeted amount in the current fiscal year than ends in March 2024. That’s equivalent to 0.6% of gross domestic product.
Standard Chartered Plc. forecasts revenue will exceed the budgeted figures by 0.2%-0.3% of
GDP
.
Bloomberg
The revenue windfall gives Modi’s government more firepower for a populist push as voters in five states take to the polls this month and the nation gears up for general elections in 2024. On Nov. 4, the prime minister told a public rally he’ll extend a popular free food program — which provides 5 kilograms of wheat or rice every month to 800 million Indians — for another five years.
The government has also increased cooking gas and fertilizer subsidies, and is considering other support measures for poor households, such as increased cash handouts to small farmers and subsidizing some home loans.

Tax collection has been stronger than expected this year as the economy expands, and the central bank has transferred more of its profits to the government, boosting public coffers. India’s direct
tax
collection from April 1 through Oct. 9 was 18% higher than a year ago, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement last month.
“We think most of the excess will be channeled into
welfare
spending, mainly in rural regions,” Bloomberg Economics’ Abhishek Gupta wrote in a note Wednesday. He estimates the government’s recently announced spending measures will amount to about 900 billion rupees, leaving it with additional headroom of 1 trillion rupees to spend on other initiatives.
The increased fiscal space means the government can boost spending measures without damaging its budget deficit target of 5.9% of GDP for the current fiscal year.
A finance ministry official said this week that the extension of the free food program announced by Modi won’t have any impact on the deficit in the current and next fiscal year. Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a report on Nov. 6 that the near-term economic implications of the initiative “should be muted” although there are medium-term risks.
Standard Chartered estimates the fiscal measures already announced and being planned are unlikely to exceed 0.3% of GDP, which means the government is on track to achieve its fiscal deficit target for the year.
“We believe better targeting of subsidies has created space to either fully or partially absorb higher expenditure,” the bank’s economists led by Anubhuti Sahay wrote in a note.

Last week, in a detailed presentation to the finance ministry, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (
UNCTAD
) pointed to the positive developments, people aware of the deliberations said. The UN agency reiterated its recent findings that India is among the top three in greenfield FDI announcements. This suggests that the country may be pulling in fresh global capacity expansion as part of supply chain diversification, a senior finance ministry official told ET. It expects these to translate into higher investment flows by 2024, the official said.
The latest Chinese data shows a first-ever quarterly FDI deficit in the July-September period.

Policymakers say that India may not be the only possible destination for FDI looking out of China but there were indications of the country becoming part of global supply chains.
""What we are seeing, in the last few months and in specific sectors, is that India is becoming part of the global supply chains,"" said Bibek Debroy, chairman of the
Economic Advisory Council
to PM (EAC-PM).
""India has been trying to build an environment that is conducive for FDI while also trying to reduce its dependence on China, particularly more so after Covid. Moreover, other countries, because of various other pressures, are also looking at reducing their dependence on China.""
Former chief economic adviser and International Monetary Fund executive director
KV Subramanian
said India holds an advantage as China faces challenges.
""As investors are looking for opportunities to generate high returns, the negative trends on FDI in China presents a crucial opportunity for India,"" he said. ""To ensure that we avail this opportunity, we must continue to undertake structural reforms and complete the several reforms that were initiated post Covid. The window of opportunity for India to benefit from this negative trend is finite!""
China's negative FDI flow is symptomatic of the structural problems that its economy is facing with significant demographic headwinds, he said.
""The same demographic dividend that helped China grow significantly from the 1980s onwards has turned negative. Secondly, huge problems in their financial sector with significant bad loans having built up, (and the) real estate sector (is) also facing difficulties with significant oversupply and over investment,"" Subramanian said. India pared corporate tax rate to 15% to boost new investment in manufacturing and has also launched production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for multiple sectors to attract funds.
FDI outflow
India's FDI equity inflows dropped 34% to $10.9 billion in the June quarter from the year-ago period. Economists said the decline in India's FDI is largely because of the prevailing high interest rates and global economic uncertainty that has impacted mergers and acquisitions activity worldwide.
They said the outlook for India remains positive.
""India's FDI intentions remain high, but like the rest of the world, higher interest rates are biting into FDI investments in India also. One needs to thus distinguish between the challenging outlook in the next six months and a fairly positive view three years out,"" said Rahul Bajoria, managing director and head of EM Asia (ex-China) economics at Barclays.

Capex hikes may go in the slow lane to trim fiscal deficit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/capex-hikes-may-go-in-the-slow-lane-to-trim-fiscal-deficit/articleshow/105052838.cms,08-11-2023,"The
finance ministry
has started discussions on reducing the pace of increase in
capital spending
in the interim budget for FY25 to align expenditure with the proposed
fiscal consolidation
glide path, said an official aware of the talks.
The government has set a target of lowering the
fiscal deficit
over the next two years to 4.5% of GDP by FY26 from 5.9% budgeted in the current year.
The government will present an interim budget for FY25 in February, leaving the full budget to the next government after elections a few months after that. The final decision will be taken closer to the interim budget, the official told
ET
.
Shift from post-pandemic policy
The government has hiked its capital expenditure (capex) in the range of 24% to 39% annually since FY22, way above the increase in revenue spending. The FY24 budget had raised capex to a record Rs 10 lakh crore, a 35.9% increase from the previous year.

""The massive capex increase, year after year, is unsustainable - especially now that the base has widened so much - if we are to reduce debt and fiscal deficit significantly,"" the person added.
Given the limited space to further compress revenue expenditure, the government may be forced to curtail the rate of capex rise, he indicated.
A deceleration in the pace of increase in capital spending would mark a shift in the government's post-pandemic policy of using this to spur economic growth through the multiplier effect it has, including the crowding in of private investment.
The deliberations have also considered the need to reduce debt levels significantly as a proportion of GDP in the medium-to-long term after a Covid-induced spike in FY21, the official said.
The government hopes the nascent rise in private investment will gather strength in the next fiscal year, giving it room to cut budgetary capex without disrupting growth momentum, he said.

free foodgrain scheme
is likely to have a muted impact on macros in the near term, but as the cost of procurement rises, the food subsidy bill is expected to increase over time, said Aurodeep Nandi and Sonal Varma,
Nomura
economists, in a report Monday.
“Over the medium term, the government is likely to forgo revenues from its subsidised food sales (0.05% of GDP on an annualised basis). As procurement costs increase, the food subsidy bill will also increase over time,” they said.
The food subsidy bill of the government has come down to 0.7% in FY24BE from 2.7% during the pandemic year of FY21.
Last week, the prime minister announced an extension of the free foodgrain scheme, started during the pandemic, by another five years. The scheme provides 5kg free foodgrain.
While the economists noted that the FY24 subsidy bill is expected to be minimal over the Rs 2 trillion budgeted for FY24, they did highlight that higher revenue expenditure could impact the government’s ability to meet its fiscal deficit target of 5.9%.

“The higher-than-budgeted rise in operational (revenue) expenditure, including rising rural employment guarantee spending and the propensity to announce further populist measures in the run-up of the general elections could impact the government’s FY24 (year ending March 2024) fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of GDP,” they stated.
The government’s food subsidy spend has remained contained below Rs 1 trillion in the first half of the year, 15% lower than the previous year.
The impact on inflation would also be negligible, Nomura stated.
“The near-term fiscal and inflation impact of the free foodgrain scheme is manageable. The need for subsidised grains for lower income households is also undeniable. However, once announced, free schemes are always difficult to roll back and can lead to competitive populism,” it said.
In the lead-up to state elections, political parties have promised farm loan waivers, cash transfer schemes to women and a return to the Old Pension Scheme, which is expected to impact state finances.

The capital expenditure by CPSEs stood at Rs 2.85 lakh crore in the same period last year and has already crossed 52% of their budget expenditure for the current financial year.
The CPSEs are expected to front load their target with spending over 90% of their

“This year's capex target is higher and the nodal ministries have already instructed their respective CPSEs to meet 90% of their target by the third quarter,” a senior official told ET.
The official added that going by the momentum, the CPSEs will exceed the annual capex target.

"Finance ministry releases Rs 10,000 crore in urgent aid for NREGS",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/finance-ministry-releases-rs-10000-crore-in-urgent-aid-for-nregs/articleshow/104955746.cms,04-11-2023,"New Delhi: The
finance ministry
has released ₹10,000 crore in urgent assistance to meet unexpected enhanced expenditure under the rural job guarantee scheme until the first batch of supplementary demands for grants is approved by parliament at its next session, a senior official said.
The unusual move came after 95% of the FY24 budgetary outlay of ₹60,000 crore for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (
MGNREGS
) was exhausted well before the commencement of the winter session of parliament, thanks to a rise in work demand, the official told ET.
The urgent funds, released last week to the
rural development ministry
, will form a part of the additional ₹28,000 crore that could be allocated for the scheme in the first batch of supplementary demands for grants for FY24, he said.
The government is yet to announce the dates for the winter session of parliament.
At a pre-budget meeting in October, the rural development ministry had asked the finance ministry for additional funds for the rural employment scheme due to enhanced work demand.

More people sought work under the MGNREGS until October this fiscal year from a year before, contradicting initial official projections of a moderation in demand. This is mainly due to an erratic monsoon that prevented the usual migration of workers to farming and a tentative industrial recovery, experts have said. Despite a 10.3% surge in August, industrial output grew 6.1% in the first five months of this fiscal year, lower than 7.7% a year before.
An up to 10.4% increase in wage rates under the MGNREGS, too, kept expenditure under the programme elevated.
Moreover, an expected shift of workers to programmes such as rural housing and water, which witnessed a spike in the FY24 budgetary outlay, didn't quite materialise. MGNREGS work demand has remained particularly high since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020.
The budget for FY24 had trimmed the MGNREGS outlay by a third to Rs 60,000 crore from the revised estimate of Rs 88,400 crore for FY23. However, finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
had pledged more funds for the scheme if required.
The person-day work generation, which influences the budgetary allocation for MGNREGS, has already exceeded 87% of the FY24 target so far, according to preliminary data compiled by the rural development ministry.
Person-days generated under the scheme rose 9.3% between April and October from a year earlier to breach the 2 billion mark, the data showed. About 214.5 million individuals opted for work under the scheme until October this fiscal year, up 5.8% from a year before.
Members of 169 million households demanded work until October this fiscal, up almost 9.5% from a year before. The data typically get revised as and when updated information flows in.

Abu Dhabi plans $50 billion investment in fast-growing India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/abu-dhabi-plans-50-billion-investment-in-fast-growing-india/articleshow/104912342.cms,02-11-2023,"The United Arab Emirates is considering investing as much as $50 billion in India, its second-largest trading partner, as part of a broader bet on the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
Provisional pledges from the UAE could be announced early next year, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. Any new investments would follow Narendra Modi’s meetings with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed in July.
The countries have been seeking to bolster ties over the past decade, and aim to increase non-oil bilateral trade to $100 billion. Modi’s recent visit to Abu Dhabi marked his fifth trip to the Gulf nation since he took over as prime minister in 2014. The last Indian
premier
to visit the UAE before him was Indira Gandhi in 1981.
Deals being discussed include stakes in key Indian infrastructure projects and state-owned assets, with announcements likely before Modi seeks a third term in federal elections due next year, the people said. Some of the investments could involve sovereign wealth funds such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Mubadala Investment Co. and ADQ, they said.
The pledges are unlikely to have clear timelines for a large chunk of the investments, the people said. No final decisions have been made on the size or timing of the announcements.

As part of the push, entities overseen by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan have held early-stage talks on investing billions of dollars in India, one of the people said. Sheikh Tahnoon is the UAE president’s brother and chairman of International Holding Co., which disclosed a 5% stake in Gautam Adani’s flagship conglomerate last month. That came days after IHC sold down holdings in two Adani firms, though the firm reiterated its commitment to India at the time.
Representatives for India’s finance and trade ministries, the UAE government, and Sheikh Tahnoon’s private investment firm Royal Group didn’t respond to requests for comment. ADIA, ADQ and Mubadala declined to comment.
Growth Engine
Royal Group has long prized India, and executives there have called the country a potential growth engine of the next decade, Bloomberg has reported. Sheikh Tahnoon is also chairman of ADQ as well as ADIA — one of the world’s largest wealth funds, with close to $1 trillion in assets.
Lured by a rising middle class and seeking to diversify away from traditional investment destinations like Europe, Gulf state-backed investors have boosted ties with India. Others including the Qatar Investment Authority and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund have also emerged as prominent investors in the country.
The UAE’s plan is a further indicator of the government’s push to position itself as a country that avoids taking sides in a world increasingly split between Washington and Beijing.
As one of few countries to manage close to $1.5 trillion in sovereign wealth, the UAE is a vital ally to the world’s most populous nation, which is seeking to bridge infrastructure gaps. For India, any large foreign investments would help Prime Minister Modi highlight his efforts to bolster the economy ahead of the 2024 vote.
Earlier this year, the UAE announced plans to support Turkey’s embattled economy with a $51 billion investment pledge, including about $30 billion in energy. Talks over one deal in that sector — just one part of the broader bilateral push — have collapsed, Bloomberg News has reported.

Cracking the Code: Q2 recovery under IBC rises to 33%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cracking-the-code-q2-recovery-under-ibc-rises-to-33/articleshow/104897639.cms,02-11-2023,"Creditors' recovery
from loans to bankrupt companies under the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
(
IBC
) rose to 33% of their admitted claims in the September quarter from 29.5% in the previous three months, according to the latest data compiled by the
insolvency
regulator.
Improved investor interest in a broad range of small and medium enterprises and above-average realisation from the assets of a large company -
Srei Group
- boosted the recovery last quarter, showed the data.
The realisation in the September quarter stood at ₹20,771 crore from about 85 stressed firms.
ET Bureau
The recovery, however, was as high as 133.3% of the fair value of the stressed companies when they were admitted for resolution. This suggests the substantial value of the assets had already eroded by the time bankruptcy proceedings were initiated.
Moreover, the recovery was 219.6% of liquidation value of these companies.
Live Events
The improved realisation in the last quarter pushed up the overall recovery since the insolvency regime came into force in late 2016 to ₹3.16 lakh crore, or 31.85% of the claims that were admitted by the adjudicating authority relating to 808 stressed firms.
However, the cumulative proceeds were 86.31% of the fair value of the companies (when the IBC was invoked) and 168.5% of their liquidation value.
Key assets
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) data for the September quarter showed Srei Group assets fetched over 41.7% of the admitted claims of creditors.
The resolution of
Srei Equipment Finance
and
Srei Infrastructure Finance
fetched ₹13,785 crore, against the admitted claims of ₹33,050 crore. The recovery was as high as 172.7% of the fair value of the company when the IBC was invoked and 280.7% of its liquidation value.
The rescue of other stressed assets (with admitted claims above ₹200 crore each) that propped up the overall recovery rate in the September quarter were Arena Superstructures (74.1% of claims of ₹781 crore); Sivana Realty (66% of ₹459 crore); Capricorn Food Products (34.9% of ₹228 crore); and
UBS Publishers
(56.2% of ₹221 crore). The realisation, however, was much higher in terms of the fair or liquidation value of these assets.

Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) on Wednesday said that it has received more than 97 per cent of Rs 2,000 notes, however,
notes
worth Rs 10,000 crore are still with public.
In May 2023, the RBI had made an official announcement regarding the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes from circulation. In a recent circular, the RBI shared that the total value of Rs 2,000 banknotes in
circulation
, which stood at Rs 3.56 lakh crore as of May 19, 2023, has now diminished to just Rs 0.10 lakh crore as of October 31, 2023.
This signifies that more than 97 per cent of the Rs 2,000 banknotes that were in circulation as of May 19, 2023, have been returned to the banking system.
For the convenience of the public, the RBI has established 19 offices across the country where individuals can deposit and/or exchange the Rs 2,000 banknotes. Additionally, the central bank has encouraged people to use India Post's post offices for the same purpose, eliminating the need to travel to RBI offices for the deposit or exchange of these notes.
However, it's worth noting that despite these facilities, there have been reports of long queues at RBI offices during working hours as individuals seek to exchange or deposit their Rs 2,000 notes

State-owned banks regularly issue advertisements listing properties for sale, typically those that have been seized because loans went bad. But the ads usually fly well below the radar of the public. That's set to change.
Bidders will be able to look at the

At a meeting held last month, the ministry told banks to fast-track the process of completing the eBKray listing and auction portal, said an official aware of the deliberations.
""Banks were told to coordinate and ensure that all technical and business issues were resolved,"" he said. ""We expect the app and the new eBkray version to go live by the end of this year.""
The eBkray project was launched in 2019 by the IBA as an
e-auction platform
to enable the online auction of attached assets by banks. It was to act as a single-window access to information on properties up for e-auction and comparisons of similar properties besides videos and photographs. But it is yet to take off.

""Now, if we can have an artificial intelligence-driven module which can segregate the solid and liquid waste, then we have the robot which would carry this and load it onto the drone and then the drone would automatically fly and carry it to the respective destination,"" he said.
Underlining that every bit of garbage is worth its return, the minister said the Department of Science and Technology, Technology Development Board and
Council of Scientific and Industrial Research
(
CSIR
) recently launched the ""recycling on wheels"" bus, which can generate wealth from waste at different spots due to its mobility.
Singh said the Dehradun-based
Indian Institute of Petroleum
(CSIR-IIP) has jointly developed a Repurposed Used Cooking Oil (RUCO) van that collects used cooking oil and converts it into biofuel, according to a personnel ministry statement.
He said the government has earned a total revenue of Rs 776 crore just by disposing of scrap in the three special campaigns undertaken by all government offices across the country in the last three years, the statement quoted the minister as having said.
""So our pace of generating revenue is also increasing. It means now we have learnt the skill of making wealth out of this,"" Singh said.
He said, thanks to Prime Minister Modi, the Swachhata campaign has become a mass movement since he initiated the idea during his first Independence Day address from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, 2014.
""In the first year of the Swachhata campaign, more than 4 lakh toilets were constructed, empowering women with 'Suvidha, Svasthya and Samman'. In the second year, a special campaign focused on the disposal of lakhs of junk files, that freed up precious office space for productive use, and cleaning e-scrap. And the special campaign 3.0 is now focused on wealth generation from waste,"" Singh said.
He said, massive participation is being witnessed across ministries and departments and urged them to adopt a saturation approach in the implementation of the campaign to cover all outstation offices/defence establishments and PSUs across the country.
The special campaign 3.0 will conclude on October 31 with the beginning of the evaluation phase in the first week of November, the statement said.

India becomes AIIB's top market for funding infrastructure projects,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-becomes-aiibs-top-market-for-funding-infrastructure-projects/articleshow/104695804.cms,25-10-2023,"Given the sheer size of infrastructure development taking place across the country, India has emerged as the biggest project funding market for the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
(AIIB), a top bank official said on Wednesday. Stating that financing of a lot more new infrastructure projects is under discussion for next year,
AIIB
South Asia Director General
Rajat Misra

This works out to more than 20 per cent of AIIB's total infrastructure project funding.

"Looking to cut debt burden, says Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/looking-to-cut-debt-burden-says-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/104596026.cms,21-10-2023,"Finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said on Friday that the government is looking at reducing its
debt
burden further and has already resorted to prudent spending by resisting the temptation of fiscal profligacy, especially after the pandemic, to avoid burdening future generations.
In her inaugural speech at the Kautilya Economic Conclave 2023 in the capital, a few months ahead of the interim Budget for FY25, she said: ""For every decision that we take today, we are conscious of what burden it is going to leave to the next generation. It's very easy to be profligate.""
The Centre aims to bring down its
fiscal deficit
to 4.5% of GDP by FY26 from the budgeted 5.9% for FY24.
The global economy, she said, is bearing the brunt of simultaneous wars in places that can severely affect supply chains.
The Israel-Hamas war has already stoked fresh uncertainties about the global supply chains - especially of food and energy - already hit by the Ukraine war and the pandemic.

Debt-to-GDP ratio
In such critical junctures, however, the decades-old multilateral institutions have become less effective,
Sitharaman
said, highlighting the urgent need for reforming them.
As for the government's debt policy, she said: ""We are conscious of the debt of the government. Compared to many other countries, it might not be as high but even then, we are consciously looking at experiments in different parts of the world (as to how to reduce the debt level),"" the minister added.
The pandemic spending and the contraction in the Indian economy exacerbated the combined debt-to-GDP ratio of the Centre and the states to 89.2% in FY21 from 75.1% in the previous year. It stands at a high level of 81.9% now, almost similar to China's 83%, but the country's debt profile doesn't face the same heightened risks as that of the world's second-largest economy, according to the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
The NK Singh panel had, in 2017, recommended cut in the combined debt ratio to 60% by FY23.
Exuding confidence that her government will succeed in its endeavour to reduce debt, Sitharaman also dwelt on ""the need to be sure that money that is being spent gives its right returns"", keeping with the ""bang for the buck"" concept. ""Our efforts are very well streamlined to meet
India
's aspirational requirement, but (we) deal with it with a sense of responsibility so that our coming generations don't feel the burden that the government will have left on them,"" the minister said.
That's why the government resorted to spending public money to create public infrastructure, ""so that we have better returns for every rupee spent"". While doing so, the government has avoided ""the temptation being periodically thrown at us"" to give money in the hands of people to spur private consumption and stir growth, she indicated.
Sitharaman said the Jan-Dhan Yojana, launched in 2014, has turned out to be the most crucial instrument in bringing financial inclusion in the country. Benefits under more than 50 government schemes are being directly transferred into the beneficiaries' bank accounts, and the combined balance in these accounts well exceeds Rs 2 lakh crore, she added.
The minister highlighted the challenges posed by global terror and said it's no longer confined to any single country or region and that global investors are increasingly starting to factor in risks to businesses from this menace.

Taxpayers slapped with unexpected notices for old tax demands,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/taxpayers-slapped-with-unexpected-notices-for-old-tax-demands/articleshow/104592384.cms,20-10-2023,"The taxman never ceases to surprise. Now, it's the season of ghost demands: old
tax demands
going back more than 15 years, long paid and closed, are popping up as new claims.
In the past few weeks, several individuals have been slapped with notices from the Income Tax (I-T) department asking them to cough up the amounts within a week.
While the department’s records show the demands as 'unpaid', tax payers who have received the notices are confident they have no such outstanding with the tax office.
Some of the notices pertain to assessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05. Many are clueless how to go about handling the notices as the old payment challans and rectification orders, which can serve as proof of tax payment, have been misplaced. The errors, sources believe, are probably a consequence of the department migrating to a new system.
""This is troublesome for many. These old demands are further sought to be adjusted against refund receivable for the current year! In most cases these demands are either paid or necessary rectifications have already been passed several years back. But the new system does not recognise the updated position. Thus the taxpayers have to submit documents in support of deletion or payment of such demands. In several cases such old records are either not easily obtainable or just plain unavailable,” said
Rutvik Sanghvi
, Partner at Rashmin Sanghvi & Associates, a CA firm.

Some taxpayers are choosing to pay up without challenging the department, if the amount in question is small. For others it could mean going through the rigmarole of an appeal.
While the tax office can go back up to ten years in reopening as assessment under the grounds that some income has escaped untaxed, there is no time limit in pursuing old demands with taxpayers.
“It would be helpful if the department can recognise the hardships faced by taxpayers for no fault of theirs, and update and correct the internal system. Demands and adjustments should ideally be put in abeyance till the new system is fully updated,"" said Sanghvi.
Some of the tax professional lobbies are planning to formally take up the matter with the I-T department. According to a
CBDT
spokesperson, ""..there maybe cases in which refunds are due to the taxpayer, but previous demands may also be outstanding. Section 245(1) of Income-tax Act, 1961, mandates providing an opportunity to the taxpayer to make a representation before adjusting the refund against an existing demand. The taxpayer is required to agree, disagree or clarify the status of the demand. Accordingly, taxpayers with existing demand(s) in the previous years are being intimated of the same. ""
Interestingly, some of the assesses who had asked for the details of such 'demands' have been told by the department that are no records of these old demands and how same had risen, said Rajesh P Shah
Partner at
Jayantilal Thakkar
and Company, another CA firm. “The department simply has the amounts and assessment years for which they relate to. Assessees will have a tough time to get the rectification done and nullify the demand,” said Shah. (The present development follows a similar situation in late August when the I-T department had accepted that there was “an erroneous adjustment communication. This time it pertains to 'pending’ demands which have been cleared.)
In Whatsapp groups of tax professionals, the matter has cropped up in recent conversations. Narrating his experience, a member of one such group said: “..I had the chance to meet an (I-T) official for an incorrect demand. The man had around 500 such cases and said the situation was similar everywhere. Further, the demands are not automatically deleted even if the officer states that payment/rectification is done. The new system requires them to raise a ticket and then upload a manual order for deletion of such demands. Even after doing this the demands have not gone from the system.”
Most feel either tax officials had not uploaded the system when the tax due were cleared or the system is faulty. Either way, it’s the taxpayer who has to deal with it.

Earlier this month, Das had said 87 per cent of the Rs 2,000 denomination notes being withdrawn have returned as deposits into banks while the rest has been exchanged across counters.
On May 19, the
Reserve Bank of India

This had followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement to withdraw more than 88 per cent of the currency in circulation by invalidating the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.

Public and entities holding such notes were initially asked to either exchange or deposit them in
bank accounts
by September 30. The last date was later extended to October 7.
On October 7, both deposit and exchange services at bank branches were discontinued.
Starting October 8, individuals were provided with the choice of either exchanging the currency or having the equivalent sum credited to their bank accounts at 19 Reserve Bank of India locations.
Individuals or entities can exchange Rs 2,000
bank notes
at the 19 RBI offices up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time. However, there is no limit on the total amount for getting Rs 2,000 notes credited into bank accounts.

Reserve Bank not looking to tighten banks' unsecured lending norms - sources,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/reserve-bank-not-looking-to-tighten-banks-unsecured-lending-norms-sources/articleshow/104578089.cms,20-10-2023,"India's
central bank
is currently not looking to tweak existing norms related to banks' unsecured lending portfolios as a sector-wide buildup of stress is not yet in sight, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Indian banks have seen a sharp rise in
unsecured loans
- mostly personal loans and credit cards - that has outpaced the overall
bank credit
growth of about 15% over the past year, catching the
Reserve Bank of India
's (
RBI
) attention.
Banks' outstanding receipts from credit cards rose to 2.18 trillion rupees ($26.26 billion) as of Aug. 25, from 1.68 trillion rupees a year earlier, latest data from the RBI showed. Outstanding personal loans rose 26% in the same period.
""The problem is not systemic at this point and is restricted to select four-five banks,"" one of the people, who is familiar with the central bank's thinking, said. The person did not name the banks.
""The RBI has already cautioned these banks and has strengthened its vigilance around unsecured loans, but increasing risk weights on unsecured lending may not be necessary at this point.""
Live Events
Both the sources declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media. The RBI did not reply to a Reuters' email seeking comment.
As per RBI norms, risk weights - or the capital that banks need to set aside for every loan - on unsecured personal loans and outstanding on credit cards currently stands at 100% and 125%, respectively.
""The deployment of overall bank credit to credit cards and personal loans as compared to the total proportion of loans in the system is not very alarming at this stage for the RBI to increase risk weights,"" the second person said.
RBI Governor
Shaktikanta Das
earlier this month said the central bank is closely monitoring some fast-growing personal loan categories for signs of nascent stress.
Subsequently, Reuters reported that the RBI is particularly concerned with the surge in tiny personal loans of up to 10,000 rupees, taken for three to four months.
Analysts, too, have been cautious about rising risks of banks' unsecured retail loans turning sour. UBS downgraded Indian banks this month, citing increasing default risks in retail unsecured loans.

World Bank

""(Going forward) economic growth will get harder for middle-income countries like India, not easier... If you (middle-income countries like India) want to get into high-income country in the next 3-4 decades then you will have to make policies based on reliable information,"" he said.
Gill pointed out that relatively few countries (31) have grown into high-income countries between 1990 and 2021.
Prime Minister

According to the World Bank, the world's middle-income countries (

GST Intelligence Officers
have uncovered a staggering
GST
evasion totaling Rs 1.36 lakh crore during the current fiscal year. The revelation underscores the persistent challenge of tax evasion in the country's fiscal landscape.
The ministry issued a statement highlighting the rigorous efforts to combat this menace. The
Directorate General of GST Intelligence
(DGGI) has been at the forefront, employing advanced data analytics tools and leveraging its extensive intelligence network across the nation to unearth tax evasion, particularly in emerging areas.
This fiscal year, which commenced in 2023, witnessed GST officers identifying evasion cases exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore within the initial six months, surpassing the previous year's figures.
The ministry reported, ""Overall in FY 2023-24, Rs 1.36 lakh crore has been detected as overall GST evasion (including fake
Input Tax Credit

A significant portion of the evasion was detected in the form of fake Input Tax Credit (ITC) during the period between April 2020 and September 2023. GST Intelligence Officers identified tax evasion amounting to Rs 57,000 crore in these cases.
The ministry stated, ""From April 2020 to September 2023, more than 6,000 fake ITC cases, involving more than Rs. 57,000 crore in GST evasion, have been detected, and a total of 500 individuals have been arrested.""
Notably, since June 2023, the DGGI has intensified efforts to identify and apprehend the masterminds behind these tax evasion syndicates operating nationwide. Advanced data analysis tools have proven instrumental in unraveling these cases and leading to the arrest of the tax evaders.
The modus operandi of these tax syndicates often involves manipulating unsuspecting individuals by offering job opportunities, commissions, or bank loans and persuading them to provide their
KYC
(Know Your Customer) documents. These documents are subsequently exploited to create fake or shell firms without the individual's knowledge or consent. In some instances, individuals are complicit, providing their KYC documents in exchange for modest monetary gains.
This latest revelation serves as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by tax evasion in India and underscores the ongoing efforts by tax authorities to combat this issue and ensure the integrity of the GST system.

India's pension system improves from 2022: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-pension-system-improves-from-2022-report/articleshow/104503899.cms,17-10-2023,"Even as India's retirement system has improved to some extent from last year, the country ranked 45 out of the 47 retirement income systems analysed, a report said on Tuesday.
India
had an overall index value of 45.9 from 44.5 in 2022, ranking 45 out of the 47 retirement income systems analysed primarily due to improvement in adequacy and sustainability sub-indices, according to the 15th annual
Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension
Index (MCGPI).
The Netherlands had the highest overall index value (85.0), closely followed by Iceland (83.5) and Denmark (81.3). Argentina had the lowest index value (42.3), it added.
This year, the Global Pension Index compares 47 retirement income systems across the globe and covers 64 per cent of the world's population.
The Global Pension Index uses the weighted average of the sub-indices of adequacy, sustainability and integrity to measure each retirement system against more than 50 indicators.
The 2023 Global Pension index includes three new retirement income systems - Botswana, Croatia, and Kazakhstan.
Live Events
The report also revealed that falling birth rates has put pressure on several economies and pension systems over the longer term, negatively affecting the sustainability scores for countries like Italy and Spain.
Several Asian systems, however, including mainland China, Korea, Singapore, and Japan, have undertaken reforms to improve their scores in the last five years.
The report further stated that India's retirement income system comprises an earnings-related employee pension scheme, a DC (defined contribution) employee provident fund (
EPFO
) and supplementary employer-managed pension schemes that are largely DC in nature.
The government schemes have been launched as part of the universal social security programme aimed at benefiting the unorganised sector, said the report.
""Changes in workforce dynamics, employment and family patterns have brought formal sources of retirement to the forefront. While there is improvement in the net pension replacement rate and participation in private pension plans, which is reflected in the value of adequacy and sustainability sub-indices, the coverage of the Indian workforce under private pension plans is still very low (6 per cent),"" Mercer - Health and Wealth,
India Business
Leader
Preeti Chandrashekhar
stated.
Given that India does not have a mandated public pension plan with contributions linked to earnings that aims at replacing some pre-retirement income, a
Social Security System
that increases coverage of unorganised workforce as well as the self-employed would further improve the efficacy of the system, she said.
""There is a growing focus on making India a full pensionable society and the government has undertaken a number of measures towards this. Facilitating further participation in private pensions would encourage higher levels of private savings.
""Focus on funding of gratuity plans, improved communication in terms of disseminating information to the members would go a long way in improving the governance and overall index value. The results from this year's Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index show that India's pension system is slowly but firmly getting stronger, with more opportunity for improvements,"" she added.

GST regime altered contours of fiscal federalism in India: Debroy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-regime-altered-contours-of-fiscal-federalism-in-india-debroy/articleshow/104404821.cms,13-10-2023,"The Goods and Services Tax regime has altered the contours of fiscal federalism in India, and steady growth of
GST
revenue is a robust barometer of the reform's success,
Economic Advisory Council
to the PM (EAC-PM) chairman
Bibek Debroy
said. In a working paper titled 'How the Pennies Drop: What GST revenue data tells us and What it doesn't',
Debroy
also proposed constructing a GST Rate Index to help track relative movements of the tax rates and get a sense of how it impacts tax collections and taxpayer behaviour.
""The introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India in 2017 not only impacted the economy but it also altered the contours of fiscal federalism in India.
""Amongst others, the steady growth of GST revenue has been a robust barometer of the success of the reform,"" he said.
Debroy also suggested a novel mechanism for computing the collection rate of GST, using only publicly available data, saying this has potential applications in revenue modelling; analysis of trends across time and geographies and for policy formulation.
"" We propose to construct a GST Rate Index. The rate index is intended as an indicator of the effective rate and is computed using GST rates data readily available in the public domain,"" he said.

With the introduction of GST, the Centre and states pooled their sovereignty in matters related to the administration of the new tax, especially in areas like policy making, fixation of rates, drafting of laws/rules etc, Debroy said.
""This is at times cited as a restriction on the powers of the states,"" he said, adding that it is equally a ""restriction"" for the central government.
Noting that the effects of GST have been measured on a number of metrics - logistics efficiencies, enhancing trade between states easing compliance by introducing uniform processes and procedures, Debroy said perhaps the biggest indicator of the efficiency and efficacy of a tax reform has to be the revenue it yields.
According to Debroy, in the six years since its launch, GST revenue collections have gone from strength to strength.
This is true for both collections on domestic supplies and integrated GST (
IGST
) paid on imports is included with the trend, particularly sharp from 2020-21 onwards, he said.
Domestic revenue collection under GST went up from Rs 8.77 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 12.94 crore in 2022-23, while the IGST went up from Rs 11.77 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 18.1 crore in 2022-23.
Debroy pointed out that while the velocity of tax collections has reduced post-introduction of GST, the buoyancy of collections has been distinctly higher in the GST regime despite a steady reduction in the tax rates.
Referring to the enhanced formalisation of the economy under the GST regime, Debroy said the total number of registered GST assesses in June 2023 was 218 per cent more at 1,40,91,249 against 44,35,653 in 2017.
Pointing out that rates of indirect taxes in India are among the lowest internationally, he said out of 37 OECD members, only four have average tax rates lower than that of India.

“ Further, a novel mechanism for computing the collection rate of GST using only publically available data is proposed to help in revenue modeling, analysis of trends across time and geographies and for policy formulation.” he said.
Buoyancy in Collection
According to Debroy, while the velocity of tax collections has reduced post introduction of GST, the buoyancy of collections have been distinctly higher in the GST regime despite a steady reduction in the tax rates.
At the time of introduction of GST, the effective weighted average GST rate stood at 14.4% which was steadily reduced to 11.6% in September 2019. “In revenue terms, this can be quantified as being a saving for the economy in excess of Rs 4.3 lakh crore in just the last year,” Dbroy said.
“This is indicative of both structural as well as administrative efficiencies especially in widening the tax base, removing distortions and improving compliances,” he added.
Formalisation of economy
Talking about enhanced formalisation of the economy under the GST regime, Debroy said the total number of registered GST assesses in June 2023 were 218% more at 1,40,91,249 as against 44,35,653 in 2017.
Besides, the total number of active companies registered went up 23% from 11,67,858, companies with authorized capital of Rs 60,92,404 crore in March, 2018 to 14,38,045 with an authorized capital of Rs 89,18,020 crore.
“From the above it is evident that the number of new entrants into the GST chain is far greater than the number of new entities formed. Taken together, this is perhaps an indicator of the enhanced formalization of the economy,” he concluded.
Tax evasion
According to Debroy, while the total number of tax evasion cases detected has shown a steady growth, however, taken as a ratio of the amount of revenue collected, the figures show a declining trend from 2020-21 onwards.
“This is perhaps an indicator of better targeted and thereby more productive interventions,” he concluded.

Two-pillar tax framework
On the sidelines of the 4th G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) meeting, a high-level panel discussed the broad agenda for capacity building in relation to the two-pillar international tax package.
The panel, comprising finance deputies from Indonesia, the UK, the UN and the World Bank, highlighted the feasibility and potential impact on developing countries of strategic responses, such as the adoption and design of optional provisions in the two-pillar package, the use of simplified approaches to protect the corporate tax base, and redesign of investment tax incentives.
Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra asserted that intensive capacity-building initiatives are imperative for the effective implementation of the two-pillar international tax package.
Manal Corwin from OECD discussed the OECD's plan to help developing countries implement the two-pillar package.

"India has high debt like China, but risks are moderated: IMF",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-has-high-debt-like-china-but-risks-are-moderated-imf/articleshow/104339854.cms,11-10-2023,"Washington:
India
has a
high debt
like that of
China
but the risks associated with it are not as great as that of its northern neighbour, a senior official from the
International Monetary Fund
has said, advising India in the medium term to have an ambitious
fiscal consolidation
plan that brings down deficits. ""The current debt in India is also high. It stands at 81.9 per cent of GDP. Compared to China, which is 83 per cent, it is very similar. Also, when we compare India's debt to the pre-pandemic level in 2019, it was 75 per cent. So it is still quite a bit higher,"" Ruud de Mooij, Deputy Director,
Fiscal Affairs Department
at International Monetary Fund, told PTI in an interview.
""What we also see in India is a deficit that is 8.8 per cent projected for 2023. In India, a large portion of this is because of expenditures on interest. They pay a lot of interest on their debt: 5.4 per cent of GDP is spent on that, and the primary deficit is 3.4 per cent. So together they add up to 8.8 per cent,"" he said.
Responding to a question, Mooij said that India's debt is not projected to rise like in China. It, in fact, is projected to fall slightly by 1.5 per cent to 80.4 per cent in 2028.
One of the reasons is that growth in India is much higher. India is one of the countries with really high growth. This matters of course for the debt to GDP ratio. Also, just to note that the risks are moderated by some factors, he said.
""One factor is, for instance, the long maturities of the debt. They don't need to be renewed very frequently. This matters for the gross financing needs. And also, in India we see a large domestic domestically held debts and also denoted in domestic currency. So these mute the risks associated with the debts,"" he said.
Live Events
The risk factor in India is the state level risks, he observed. ""Some states really have high debts, have high financing needs and face a high interest burden. This is a factor that does mean that there are significant risks also for India,"" he said.
""What should India do? Well, the policy advice is for the medium term to have an ambitious fiscal consolidation plan that brings down the deficits, especially the primary deficits through a range of measures. It could be on the revenue side, could be on the spending side, and it could also be on fiscal management, sort of using good fiscal rules, fiscal frameworks to manage the fiscal equation going forward. That is the overall advice that we would recommend,"" Mooij said.
The
debt level
is projected to be rather stable at 80 per cent. ""What we would recommend is at least a decreasing path of debt, because what we see is that
interest expenditures
are 5.4 per cent of GDP,"" he said.
Mooij said one of the ways in which India could usefully support fiscal consolidation is by strengthening the tech system. There are several opportunities here. There are opportunities in the general sales tax, which has multiple rates, many exemptions, and maybe not all of them are effective.
Improving the design of the general sales tax could contribute to this. We also see opportunities for broadening the base of the personal income tax and the corporate income tax where there are many loopholes that can often be addressed, he said.
""For instance, there's the fuel tax cuts that could be reversed. On the revenue side, and several options on the spending side, we think it's important to prioritize public investments as India has been doing. There's important gains, especially with the current growth from investing in public infrastructure, but also investment in education, healthcare and maybe less priority for spending that is less efficient,"" he added.
""For instance, certain subsidies may be provided too much across the board and support to households could be better targeted to those who really need it. In many areas, we think there's opportunities for improving spending efficiency, so reducing waste,"" he said.
The management of the fiscal policies could be improved, the
IMF
official said. ""For instance, public financial management could sometimes be made more transparent. We are working also with India on these issues, sharing best practices from other countries. The management of fiscal policy could benefit from a strong fiscal framework with an independent institution that advises on fiscal policy with clear fiscal rules that commit the government to certain objectives.
""There is a lot of good experience with these kinds of fiscal frameworks in achieving results for the fiscal equation,"" Mooij said.

Prime Minister Modi weighs giving small farmers more cash before 2024 elections,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/prime-minister-modi-weighs-giving-small-farmers-more-cash-before-2024-elections/articleshow/104328072.cms,11-10-2023,"India
’s government is considering a plan to boost cash support to small
farmers
by a third, allowing Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
’s ruling party to shore up support from a key voting bloc ahead of elections.
The government is weighing options to raise the annual direct cash transfer to small farmers to Rs 8,000 ($96) from Rs 6,000, according to two officials familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified as the matter is still under consideration.
If approved, the plan would cost the government an extra Rs 20,000 crore, according to the people, on top of the Rs 60,000 crore budgeted for the program in the current fiscal year through March
2024
.
Nanu Bhasin
, a spokesperson for the
Finance Ministry
, declined to comment on the matter.
With some 65% of India’s 1.4 billion people living in rural areas, farmers are a crucial voting bloc for Modi, who is seeking a rare third term in office in the upcoming election. Though he remains a popular leader, with 55% of voters viewing him as favorable, issues around rising inequality and joblessness may pose a challenge to him at the polls.

The government is trying to bolster farmers’ income after its inflation-control measures, such as a ban on some rice exports, curbed rural incomes. India has also recorded its weakest monsoon rains in five years, threatening this year’s harvests of key crops.
Since the subsidy program kicked off in December 2018, Modi’s government has doled out Rs 2.42 lakh crore in total to 110 million beneficiaries. Officials are now discussing relaxing rules to include more farmers under the direct cash transfer program, the people said. A final decision on these proposals have yet to be taken, they said.
The government is also taking other measures to support poorer households, such as extending a free grains program into next year and considering subsidized loans for small urban housing. Last week, the cabinet approved an increase in subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas, used for cooking.

The prices shot up reflecting the overall higher risk averseness of investors with the rising
interest rates
along with higher demand, which rose by 14 per cent at the auction in spite of a jump in the average tenor to 15 years from 13 years last week.
Eight states raised Rs 9,600 crore through state government securities (SGS) on Tuesday, which is 13.6 per cent higher than the amount indicated for this week in the auction calendar, according to
Aditi Nayar
, the chief economist at
Icra Ratings
.
The sharp increase in the cutoffs of the 10-year and above issuances in the auction pushed the weighted average cut-off to 7.68 per cent, the highest in FY24 so far, up from 7.56 per cent last week, she said.
The weighted average tenor also increased to 15 years from 13 years last week.

Centre collected Rs 600 crore from online gaming companies in TDS,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-collected-rs-600-crore-from-online-gaming-companies-in-tds/articleshow/104317201.cms,10-10-2023,"The Centre has collected Rs 600 crore from the
online gaming companies
as Tax deducted at source (
TDS
) and Rs 105 crore from the cryptocurrencies in the current financial year, Chairman, Central Board of Direct Taxes (
CBDT
) Nitin Gupta said Tuesday.
""We have collected Rs 600 crore from
online gaming
companies in the first six months,” Gupta said in an interaction with the media.
The CBDT Chairman said that while there was a rule earlier it was subject to diverse interpretations and now rules are simplified, this will ensure better compliance for both players and companies.
From April 1, the online game companies are required to deduct TDS on all winning over Rs 100 from an online game. The provision was introduced after the Income tax department detected that a large number of companies are not paying any tax on winnings from online gaming companies.
The centre made it mandatory for online gaming companies to deduct TDS at 30% of the winning amount under the newly introducing Section 194BA of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Live Events
Till the previous financial year (FY 2022-23), TDS on winnings from online games was applicable if the winning amount exceeded Rs 10,000 in a financial year.
In case if a user has multiple user accounts, each user account is considered for calculating net winnings. The deposit, withdrawal or balance will be on the aggregate basis of all user accounts.
The government had introduced the provision of deducting TDS on crypto transaction in the last budget.

"Public capex will decline as govt reduces fiscal deficit, private investment must step up: Goldman Sachs",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/public-capex-will-decline-as-govt-reduces-fiscal-deficit-private-investment-must-step-up-goldman-sachs/articleshow/104290660.cms,09-10-2023,"Private investment
needs to pick up as the level of capex cannot be sustained by the government, said
Goldman Sachs
in a report released Monday. The global investment bank stated that
public capex
has peaked and will decline as the government reduces its
fiscal deficit
by almost 1.5 percentage points to 4.5% by FY26.
“With subsidies already near the pre-pandemic lows (Exhibit 16), it is likely that a cut in public capex (as a % of GDP) will have to share the burden of fiscal consolidation, among a reduction in other current expenditure, and likely some improvement in tax receipts,” Goldman Sachs analysts stated.
The government has set a fiscal deficit target of 5.9% for FY24. Central government capex has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 33% over the last three years, with the ratio of capex spending doubling to 3.3% in FY24 from 1.5% between FY18 and FY21.
“The Indian private corporate sector has an opportunity to increase investment growth over this decade, as companies re-align their supply chains and potentially diversify beyond China manufacturing locations,” the report further pointed out.
Experts have been indicating green shoots of private capex recovery to supplement the push in government capex.

Goldman Sachs noted that deleveraged bank balance sheets and well-capitalised bank balance sheets could aid in capex recovery. The bank also noted that faster regulatory clearances were also required to aid the private sector.
While the investment bank highlighted that domestic industrial production and global demand have been more important drivers of investment growth in the past than financing conditions, it pointed that domestic demand would be driving investment activity in coming years.
“Given the focus on ‘Make in India’ and import substitution, we expect a pick-up in private investment activity in coming years to be driven more by domestic demand, and easing of supply-side bottlenecks,” it said.

He said the government is, by and large, sticking to the fiscal consolidation roadmap after the end of the pandemic, which had seen some expansion because of the high spending.
Even during the pandemic, the government's spending was ""calibrated and targeted"", Das noted.

As the banker to the government, the RBI does not have any worry on the central government finances, Das said.
The ""outlier"" loan growth of 33 per cent as against the overall credit growth of 13-14 per cent made the RBI flag the issue of personal
loans
and prompt banks to take steps to avoid any risk build-up, Deputy Governor
J Swaminathan
said.
Das asked the financiers to ""smell where the crisis is likely to come up"" and take appropriate steps.
The governor also said that the gross non-performing assets have improved in the June quarter, if one were to go by the unaudited results.

India's inclusion in JPMorgan Bond Index may spur inflows of $23b: FM Sitharaman,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-inclusion-in-jpmorgan-bond-index-may-spur-inflows-of-23b-fm/articleshow/104195673.cms,09-10-2023,"New Delhi: Finance minister Nirmala
Sitharaman
on Thursday said JPMorgan's decision to include Indian government bonds in its widely tracked
emerging market debt index
could potentially lead to annual inflows of about $23 billion into the country.
JPMorgan will start adding the securities from June 28, 2024 and India will have a maximum weight of 10% on the index.
The minister said political stability, policy consistency and decisive reforms brought about by the NDA government have kept the economy in good stead and will help the country emerge as the world's third-largest economy in a few years.
Delivering a speech at Delhi's Shri Ram College of Commerce, the minister said India has already become the world's fifth-largest economy from the 10th largest in 2013-14. But this upward movement wasn't a given thing nor is the future expansion an irrefutable proposition, she said, suggesting that economic growth is earned with hard work and not received on a platter.
What India's Inclusion in JP Morgan's Bond Index Means for Markets, Banks & the Rupee
Indian markets are buzzing about the latest announcement from JPMorgan Chase. It could mean a game-changing shift for India's financial landscape. Here's how
The global macro-economic situation remains volatile, with food, fuel and fertiliser remaining in short supply in many countries in the wake of the Ukraine war, she said, highlighting the challenges for policy-makers not just in India but around the world.

The minister said political instability and the compulsions of coalition politics can result in flip-flops in policy-making and potentially impact the economy. Industry always seeks policy consistency, and only a decisive and stable political leadership like the current one can provide that, she said.
The policy-makers need to be futuristic and ready for reforms, she said. They must provide consistency for businesses to grow. And that's exactly the difference between the decision-making of the NDA government and that of the earlier regime, she said.
India will remain the world's fastest-growing economy in 2023-24, with a growth rate of 6.1%, the International Monetary Fund has said.
The finance minister's statement comes after senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh recently said India's emergence as the world's third-largest economy is ""guaranteed"" regardless of who forms the government after the 2024 elections. Ramesh was responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pledge to make India the third-largest economy during his third term (2024-29).

Stimulating international investment for development,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/stimulating-international-investment-for-development/articleshow/104188928.cms,05-10-2023,"WIF
is by far the biggest platform in the UN system on
international investment
in
sustainable development
and aims to devise strategies and solutions for global
investment
and development challenges.
Investment is the key to development. Investment fosters economic growth and employment generation, facilitates technology transfer, and enhances export capabilities, underscoring investment's multifaceted role in driving development.
As per the latest UNCTAD World Investment Report 2023, developing countries face a widening annual investment deficit, as these nations work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The gap is now about $4 trillion per year – up from $2.5 trillion in 2015 when the SDGs were adopted, the report highlights.
The disruption in global supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently the war in Ukraine have adversely affected even the flows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Global FDI declined by 12 percent in 2022 to $1.2 tn. Hence, focusing on investment-led growth and balancing economic growth with its development dimensions is important.
Addressing a three-fold crisis
The international investment climate we are in today is primarily facing three-fold challenges viz. food, climate change, and energy. Almost all countries are facing the heat of food security. Energy prices have steeply risen and many countries are staring at a debt crisis. Such uncertainty caused by these crises is a great test for international investments.

Reckoning the challenges, G20 leaders met in New Delhi, India on September 9-10. The G20 leaders pledged to work together to address the three challenges of climate finance and investment, investment and health, and Agri-food systems.
The G20 leaders agreed to facilitate access to multilateral climate funds and enhance their leverage and ability to mobilise private capital. They reiterated the need for a policy mix consisting of fiscal, market, and regulatory mechanisms.
The G20 communique also committed to improving access to medical countermeasures and facilitating more supplies and production capacities in developing countries to prepare better for future health emergencies.
The G20 Leaders also endorsed the G20 Deccan High-Level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition 2023 and resolved to encourage investments in inclusive, sustainable, and resilient agriculture and food systems.
However, many of these outcomes of the G20 represent only incremental progress, but better than nothing. Furthermore, they also resolved to build on existing international frameworks for digital trade facilitation and integrating MSMEs into the global trading system.
With the primary objective of building an investor-friendly business environment, over 110 members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) concluded text-based negotiations on the Agreement on Investment Facilitation for Development (IFA).
WTO’s IFA can create opportunities for developing and least-developed countries (LDCs) to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) for a more sustainable future. It could also help simplify investment procedures.
World Investment Forum
Expected to gather more than 6,000 investment stakeholders from 160 countries,
United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) World Investment Forum taking place in Abu Dhabi, UAE from October 16-20 will be an opportune platform for deliberating and coming up with solutions for investment in sustainable development.
WIF is by far the biggest platform in the UN system on international investment in sustainable development and aims to devise strategies and solutions for global investment and development challenges. It facilitates multi-stakeholder collective action to stimulate investment in development.
A session at the WIF 23 “Game changing solutions for sustainable development: Food security"" shines a spotlight on innovative ideas, technologies, and business models for creating sustainable food systems. It will allow participants to engage with the business leaders who are at the forefront of developing solutions to enhance food production and distribution to tackle the food security crisis.
Meanwhile, addressing the concerns of climate change, WIF 23 would be an important milestone on the road to December’s CoP28, also being held in Abu Dhabi few weeks later, giving participants the opportunity to prepare for the upcoming climate negotiations.
Climate finance is likely to be a key aspect of the discussions at CoP 28 to be held in Dubai, with many government delegates and financial market participants joining the WIF, both to take stock of progress made so far and to accelerate as much as possible.
CUTS International is advocating for a ‘fund of funds’ to establish an agnostic Innovation Finance for Climate and Planet fund which would be able to help salvage and create protective measures for both climate and biodiversity. This proposal includes blended finance such as PPPs on green projects.
Investment in health is another priority of WIF 23 with a session on “Investing in Health” that would draw attention to the fact that that at least $100 billion in additional investment is needed annually in healthcare facilities and infrastructure in developing countries alone.
This session would highlight that domestic funding and development assistance are not meeting the demand for investment. International private sector investment – within the right policy and regulatory setting – can help bridge the gap between the aspirations and realities of healthcare services in developing countries.
By participating in the World Investment Forum (WIF) 2023, individuals and organisations passionate about sustainable development can contribute their insights and actively engage in shaping a more inclusive and sustainable global investment landscape.
Together, we can advocate for responsible and equitable investment practices, hold stakeholders accountable, and together, drive positive change and work towards a future where investment truly benefits all.
The authors work for CUTS International, a 40 year old global public policy research and advocacy think and action tank.

World Bank for $100 billion extra annual lending capacity for climate change and poverty,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/world-bank-for-100-billion-extra-annual-lending-capacity-for-climate-change-and-poverty/articleshow/104168648.cms,05-10-2023,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the meeting of
G20 finance ministers
and central bankers, under India’s presidency, in Marrakech next week, the Development Committee of the
World Bank
has proposed the creation of additional annual lending capacity of more than $100 billion over the next decade for the multilateral lender to run a more inclusive agenda on
climate change
and poverty alleviation.
The final recommendations of the joint ministerial committee of the boards of governors of World Bank and the International Monetary Fund reflect suggestions made by the Independent Expert Group set up by the G20 co-chaired by 15th Finance Commission chairman N.K. Singh and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers.
The group has already submitted its second volume to finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
and will make a detailed presentation to the G20 at Marrakech, a person privy to the development told ET.
The group has suggested a roadmap and a detailed plan to reform multilateral development banks (MDBs), including the World Bank and
Asian Development Bank
.
The details include proposals that would enable MDBs to harness private capital apart from stepping up their financial capacity.

“We are going into greater granularity on how you really achieve this private capital---what incentive, risk mitigation can you do,” Singh said in an interview 10 days back.
The IEG had cited the need for $3 trillion to meet sustainable development goals by 2030, which it said, “includes a tripling of financing from all multilateral development banks (MDBs).”
“The proposed measures, along with the ‘preferencing’ approach, also respond to the innovative fundraising mechanisms (“Global Challenges Funding Mechanisms”) proposed in the report of an Independent Expert Group, commissioned by the G20,” the Development Committee paper stated.
The New Delhi Declaration adopted by G20 leaders in September had agreed to reforming MDBs to make them bigger and better and more cognisant of the needs of the Global South.

States' borrowing cost soars to 23-week high of 7.56%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/states-borrowing-cost-soars-to-23-week-high-of-7-56/articleshow/104139349.cms,03-10-2023,"States' borrowing cost jumped 10 basis points to 7.56 per cent at the first
weekly debt auction
of the third quarter on Tuesday and is the highest in the the past 23 weeks. Fourteen states raised Rs 22,500 crore through the issuance of state government securities in line with the indicated amount for this weekly auction for the third quarter calendar.

, the auctions saw a steep increase in the cut-offs across tenors leading to the weighted average cost jumping to a 23-week high of 7.56 per cent.
It stood at 7.46 percent last week.
The higher pricing of the borrowing is despite a steep decline in the weighted average tenor to 13 years from 17 years, Nayar said.
Moreover, she said the spread between the cut-off of 10-year state bonds and the new 10-year G-Secs (7.18 GS 2033)
yield
rose mildly to 33 bps from 32 bps last week.

Finance ministry seeks expenditure proposals from ministries for supplementary demands for grants,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/finance-ministry-seeks-expenditure-proposals-from-ministries-for-supplementary-demands-for-grants/articleshow/104137945.cms,04-10-2023,"NEW DELHI: The
finance ministry
on Tuesday invited proposals for funds from various departments and ministries for inclusion in the first batch of supplementary
demands for grants
for FY24, asking them to be realistic and objective in their assessment of additional requirements.
In an office memorandum, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has asked them to submit supplementary proposals within seven days of the completion of their pre-budget meetings with the finance ministry, scheduled to take place between October 10 and November 14. The supplementary demands for grants will be placed before
Parliament
for approval in the next session.
“While processing proposals for supplementary grants, the grant controlling authority must invariably identify savings available within the grant so that the infructuous or inflated supplementary demands are weeded out and the eventuality of surrender after obtaining supplementary grant is avoided,” the DEA said. In cases where re-appropriations can be made without the requirement of supplementary grants as per the extant provisions, no supplementary proposal, including for a token amount, should be proposed, it said.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit in the first five months of this fiscal year hit 36% of the annual target, up from 32.6% a year before. Senior government officials have highlighted the Centre's plan to stick to its FY24 fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of gross domestic product, while maintaining that some programmes could see revisions in spending from the budgeted levels.

RBI in dialogue with other central banks to reduce cost of cross border remittances,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-in-dialogue-with-other-central-banks-to-reduce-cost-of-cross-border-remittances/articleshow/104047526.cms,29-09-2023,"The
Reserve Bank of India
has initiated dialogues with countries having sizable Indian diaspora to bring down cost of remittances, deputy governor
T Rabi Sankar
said.
According to the
World Bank
, the average cost of
cross border
remittance is about 6.2% of the value of a transaction.
""Such a high cost in today's context, when data connectivity is so cheap, is simply unconscionable,"" Rabi Sankar said Friday, delivering his keynote address at a Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industry event.
""I believe with the available technology, this system is not sustainable.""
""We have followed up on this in July by signing an MoU with the central bank of UAE, cooperation regarding inter-linking on mutual payment and messaging system,' he said.
Live Events
India signed an agreement with Singapore in February this year to link their respective payment systems using the Unified Payments Interface (
UPI
) allowing the users of both the countries to make cross-border transactions using mobile apps in a cost effective way.
The deputy governor said that the spread of digital payment infrastructure has become one of the critical drivers of economic growth.
Speaking about India’s growth story post COVID at the event, India's chief economic advisor, V Anantha Nageswaran said that the response and recovery phase is over and now it is all about consolidation.
""India is poised for good and steady growth for the rest of this decade. Our goal should not be only to become the third-largest economy in aggregate size but also in per capita terms, becoming a middle-income or upper middle-income country, for that we need to make sure that the aspiring middle class is not only able to get the kind of goods and services that they need but they are also in a position to contribute and this is not just a task for the public sector but also the private sector,"" he said.

Centre's fiscal deficit up to August rises to almost 36% of FY24 target,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centres-fiscal-deficit-up-to-august-rises-to-almost-36-of-fy24-target/articleshow/104044407.cms,29-09-2023,"The Central government’s
fiscal deficit
in the first five months of this fiscal year hit 36% of the annual target, up from 32.6% a year before, as the pace of spending slowed a tad in August from the previous month but it still remained higher than the previous year, showed the official data released on Friday.
In absolute terms, the fiscal
deficit
touched Rs 6.43 lakh crore between April and August, compared with Rs 5.42 lakh crore a year earlier. Until July, the Centre’s fiscal deficit had touched 33.9% of the annual target, sharply higher than 20.5% a year earlier.
Capital spending jumped 48% between April and August from a year earlier to Rs 3.74 lakh crore, higher than the budgeted annual rise of about 36%, as the government kept pushing such productive expenditure to spur economic growth.
Revenue expenditure rose 14.1% year on year until August this fiscal year to Rs 12.98 lakh crore, way above the targeted annual increase of 1.5%. Overall expenditure increased 20.3% to Rs 16.72 lakh crore, higher than the annual budgeted rise of 7.5%.
Senior finance ministry officials have already asserted that the FY24 fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of gross domestic product (or Rs 17.87 lakh crore) will be strictly adhered to even though the spending under a few schemes could vary from the budgetary outlays.

Meanwhile, net tax revenues for the Centre rose 14.8% until August this fiscal to Rs 8.04 lakh crore, reversing a drop until July. The net tax revenue improved in August, thanks to lower devolution to states after the front-loading of such transfers earlier this fiscal year.
Non-tax revenues surged 79% to almost Rs 2.1 lakh crore, driven by handsome dividends by the Reserve Bank of India.
Total receipts dropped to Rs 10.3 lakh crore between April and August, down 21.3% from a year before and compared with the targeted annual increase of 10.6%.
ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said: ""A year-on-year dip in the amount of tax devolution to the states in August 2023 helped to narrow the wedge in the fiscal deficit in April-August FY24 relative to the year-ago levels, and also contained the monthly increment in the fiscal deficit to a low Rs 372 billion.""

India's current account deficit almost halves to $9.2 billion in June quarter,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-current-account-deficit-almost-halves-to-9-2-billion-in-june-quarter/articleshow/104017993.cms,28-09-2023,"India's current account balance- the difference between country's exports and imports almost halved to a deficit of $9.2 billion in the June quarter from $17.9 billion in the same period a year ago as lower global crude and commodity prices helped narrow the merchandise

narrowed to .1 per cent of GDP in the June quarter from 2.1 per cent of GDP period comparable qaurter ending June 2022. But it was higher than $ 1.3 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP) in the preceding Mrach 2023 quarter, according to the preliminary numbers released by the
Reserve Bank of India
.
"" The current account deficit widened in Q2 on account of a higher goods trade deficit and increase in outbound remittances,"" said Rahul Bajoria, MD & Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics, Barclays. Higher foreign fund flows in the quarter meant the capital account financed the CAD comfortably, leading to a BoP surplus.
The widening of CAD on a quarter-on-quarter basis was primarily on account of a higher trade deficit coupled with a lower surplus in net services and a decline in private transfer receipts, the Reserve Bank said in a release
The merchandise trade deficit was lower at $56.6 billion during the June quarter compared to $63 billion in the same period a year ago. The contribution of software services was significant at $ 33.9 bn compared to $ 30.7 bn in the June quarter last year. "" This is a positive sign which has been helped by the fact that the US economy has done much better than expected which has kept demand for such services buoyant, "" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist,

Increased monthly GST collections mainly on account of higher compliance: CBIC chief,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/increased-monthly-gst-collections-mainly-on-account-of-higher-compliance-cbic-chief/articleshow/104016358.cms,28-09-2023,"CBIC
chief
Sanjay Kumar Agarwal
on Thursday said increased monthly
GST
collections are mainly on account of higher compliance, and the GST Council's decision to tighten return filing and registration process would help reduce fake
ITC
claims in evasion prone sectors, including iron and steel. Agarwal said the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has received suggestions regarding streamlining tax rates in evasion-prone sectors and all that is being discussed.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection was Rs 1.87 lakh crore in April and in the first four months of the current fiscal, the collections have averaged Rs 1.67 lakh crore.
""The buoyancy of revenue is 1.43 of nominal GDP growth meaning thereby revenue collection is not entirely on account of growth in GDP, but a major contribution is made by increased compliance level,"" the CBIC chief said at the Ficci Cascade event here.
Tax buoyancy explains the relationship between changes in government tax revenue growth and changes in GDP.
To enhance compliance, the department has taken a soft approach of nudging taxpayers for timely and accurate filing of returns and selecting taxpayers for scrutiny and audit by risk analysis.

""Less than 1 per cent of taxpayers are selected for scrutiny by way of audit based on risk behaviour analysis,"" Agarwal said.
Agarwal said the government is taking all possible measures to encourage tax compliance and dissuade fraudsters from entering the GST system.
""The recent decisions in successive council meetings to make changes in return filing are in that direction so that menace of fake ITC can be curbed,"" he said, adding that many sectors, like that of iron and steel, are impacted by the menace of fake input tax credit to a large extent.
Agarwal said that the solution to deal with fake ITC generation is quite complex and the department has received various suggestions regarding rates.
""It is being discussed. It's not just iron and steel but other sectors also,"" he said, adding that the GST Council's recent decision on the return filing and registration process would help in solving the problem of fake ITC and fake businesses.
In June, CBIC introduced validation and risk rating for GST registrations, as it looks to curb fake entities issuing fake bills just to claim ITC benefits and defraud the exchequer.
In a two-month-long special drive to detect fake registration, the CBIC officers have identified over 9,000 bogus entities and detected about Rs 11,000 crore worth of GST. Recovery of over Rs 45 crore was made.

At the end of July, the Centre's fiscal deficit had hit 33.9% of the full-year estimate, compared to 20.5% a year ago, raising some concern over whether the government would be able to meet the fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of GDP.
India Ratings
chief economist DK Pant said, ""Adherence to budgeted FY24 market borrowing target is likely to be a neutral event for the bond market. Actual market borrowing, however, will hinge on the performance of the National Small Savings Fund.""
Pant said the introduction of the 50-year bond would test the investor appetite for such long-term papers and that the move was driven by the market development point of view.
The borrowing in the second half of the fiscal is scheduled to be over in 20 weekly tranches of Rs 30,000-39,000 crore. The share of borrowing for 10-year maturity will be the highest, at 22,90%, according to the ministry, followed by 40-year maturity (18.32%), 14-year (15.27%), 30-year (12.21%), five-year (11.45%), seven-year (9.16%), three-year (6.11%) and 50-year maturity (4.58%).
""The government will continue to carry out switching of securities to smoothen the redemption profile. Out of the Rs 1,00,000 crore of budgeted switch amount, Rs 51,597 crore of switch auctions have already been conducted and the balance amount of switch auctions will be conducted in H2,"" the statement said.
It will also exercise a green-shoe option to retain an additional subscription of up to ₹2,000 crore against each of the securities indicated in the auction notification.
ICRA
chief economist Aditi Nayar said, ""Once the revenue and expenditure position is clearer, the government may consider tweaking the borrowing figure for the March quarter, if required.""
The RBI has fixed the Ways and Mean Advances limit at ₹50,000 crore for the second half of the fiscal.

NABARD
) concluded the country's first
social impact bond
issue, but raised less than it could have due to higher costs for the issuer, three
bankers
said on Tuesday.
NABARD accepted bids worth 10.40 billion rupees ($124.9 million), the bankers said, declining to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
NABARD had planned to raise at least
10 billion rupees
via this issue, with a greenshoe option to retain an additional 20 billion rupees. The state-run company has set a coupon of 7.63% on this issue.
While the financier received bids worth around 86 billion rupees, it chose to retain only around the base size due to the higher coupon demanded, an official from NABARD said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to media.
""We saw strong demand from banks and provident funds,"" the official added.

NABARD did not immediately reply to a Reuters email seeking additional comments.
Projects that promise
energy efficiency
, including green buildings, energy storage, and smart grids, would be eligible for funding through these bonds, the company said in a statement.
AK Capital
, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership and Trust Investment Advisors were among the arrangers for the bond issue, which was rated AAA by CRISIL and
ICRA
.
Bonds for funding green projects or social impact projects have failed for issuers in India as they yield on par with
vanilla bonds
.
The government has also seen its green bonds issued only marginally below the cost of regular securities, as there is a common pool of investors.
""In India, investors do not have a mandate to invest in ESG, social or
green bond
,"" a fixed income head of a life insurance company said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to media.
""It does not make sense for us to invest at lower coupon when we can get plain vanilla bonds at a higher rate,"" this person said, adding that for this market to pick up, investors need an incentive and a steady flow of such issues.

JPMorgan M&A head sees up to $150 billion funds focused on India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/jpmorgan-ma-head-sees-up-to-150-billion-funds-focused-on-india/articleshow/103921522.cms,25-09-2023,"Investors have about $2 trillion of funds available to invest, and about $100 billion to $150 billion of that is focused on India, according to
Anu Aiyengar
,
JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s global head of mergers and acquisitions.
“As we look at a combination of the inflows into the
Indian market
, as well as the exits financial sponsors have successfully been able to do, that bodes well for more money getting deployed in India,” Aiyengar said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Rishaad Salamat during the bank’s closed-door India Investor Summit in Mumbai.
The New York-based banker pointed to India’s fast-rising GDP among the attributes that make it so attractive.
“It is hard to find a market like this which has the growth characteristics and stability as well as tech, health care and infra solutions that are being provided by a multitude of companies,” Aiyengar added.
There were $33 billion worth of M&A deals in India in the year to date, down nearly 72% compared to the same period in 2022.
Housing Development Finance
Corp.’s all-stock merger with
HDFC Bank Ltd.
, which JPMorgan worked alongside 17 other advisers, helped drive volume in the country to a record last year. It’s a stark contrast with 2023, where a global dealmaking slump has gripped the industry.
Live Events
JPMorgan is ranked second globally for M&A volume in the year to date, moving up from third place in 2022, according to Bloomberg’s league tables.
Along with the dominant investment themes around the world of technology and health care, Aiyengar cited infrastructure and the energy transition as particularly strong drivers of India M&A.
“You have multiple infrastructure-only funds that are now getting set up, and the infrastructure spend in India is substantial,” she said.
In terms of opportunities for owners to exit, Aiyengar sees green shoots emerging in the recently quiet initial public offering market. So-called dual track dealmaking, where asset owners consider selling their holdings either via IPOs or an M&A deal, will be on the table.
“We’re very bullish on the propensity of companies to exit in both markets, and being able to successfully run dual tracks, comparing and contrasting valuations in the private market as well as public markets,” she said.

“Retail and consumer products was the second largest sector with US$1 billion recorded across four deals. PE/VC exits were at US$4.3 billion across 37 deals, a y-o-y increase of 35% by value. August 2023 has witnessed the highest value of exits during the year so far,” said Soni.
The study said that startups are facing a funding winter, with VC investments in 3Q2023 likely to be the lowest in eight quarters but nonetheless, there are some bright spots for India.
In the global context, VC investments have declined by 51% in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year, with the second quarter of 2023 being the weakest in over six quarters.
In India, the situation is even more pronounced, with year-to-date VC investments down by 69%, and the third quarter of 2023 is expected to record the lowest VC investments in eight quarters, as per the analysis.
The slowdown has affected all deal segments, from seed to late-stage growth, said the study.
The analysis pointed out that the decline in the number of new unicorns globally and in
India
highlights the extent of this slowdown, with only 120 new unicorns in 2023 (compared to 669 in 2022) globally and just one unicorn in India in 2023 (compared to 21 in 2022).

No systemic risk build-up seen in India's bank credit: RBI Deputy Guv Michael Patra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/no-systemic-risk-build-up-seen-in-indias-bank-credit-rbi-deputy-guv-michael-patra/articleshow/103840031.cms,21-09-2023,"India is on track to become a $5 trillion economy by 2027 and at present, there are no visible signs of overheating,
Reserve Bank of India
Deputy Governor
Michael Patra
said in a recent speech delivered in Cambodia.
""
Bank credit
is monitored as a lead indicator of overheating,"" Patra said in the speech published by the
RBI
on Thursday.
""Our assessment, based on a menu of approaches, indicates that current rates of credit expansion are not pointing to systemic stress building up - warning lights flash in the Indian context at growth rates of 16-18%.""
Indian bank loans rose 19.8% from a year earlier in the two weeks to Aug. 25, the latest RBI data showed.
This growth has been boosted by a merger between India's largest bank
HDFC Bank Ltd
and HDFC Ltd, which became effective July 1.
Live Events
Net interest margins in the banking system are averaging around 3.8%, below the 5% threshold, Patra said. Beyond that level, it could have implications for financial stability.
The deputy governor said the current episode of bank credit expansion is led by
retail loans
and since these loans are being distributed across a wider borrower base, they mitigate the accumulation of systemic risk.
""We are, however, watchful as herding by banks in the retail loan space might lead to potential cascades across the system if defaults do occur,"" he said.

and private equity funds' investments increased to USD 5.2 billion across 67 deals in August, a report said on Wednesday. The investments are more than double of the USD 2.3 billion witnessed in August 2022, even though the number of transactions has declined from 32 in the year-ago period, as per the monthly report by industry lobby grouping Indian Private Equity and
Venture Capital Association
(IVCA) and consultancy firm EY.
The consultancy firm's partner
Vivek Soni
said funds are skeptical as growth remains elusive for many startups and valuations remain high.
""With many sovereign wealth funds, especially from the Gulf nations, setting up shop in India and also increasing their exposure to Indian startups, the medium to long-term outlook remains positive for the Indian startup sector despite the current short-term issues of tepid growth and governance troubles at some startups,"" he said.
There were 13 large deals of more than USD 100 million each, aggregating to USD 4.5 billion in August, which is a 416 per cent jump from the same in the year-ago period.
Fourteen deals involving investments of USD 2.4 billion were classified as growth investments as compared to just USD 176 million in nine deals in August 2022.

Gender budgeting revamp on the cards to better log spends on women schemes,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gender-budgeting-revamp-on-the-cards-to-better-log-spends-on-women-schemes/articleshow/103794847.cms,20-09-2023,"India is considering a major change in the annual
budget
to better capture
spending
on gender equality and women's empowerment. This will entail a revamp in the gender budget statement that's part of the annual exercise.
The focus is likely to be on ex-ante
gender budgeting
, based on forecasts, while linking the spending with outcomes under various heads to make it more impactful. This comes amid the introduction of the women's reservation bill aimed at increasing female representation in the legislature.
A panel set up by the
Ministry of Women and Child Development
(MoWCD) and headed by Dakshita Das, former bureaucrat and
National Housing Bank
managing director, suggested a number of changes in its report submitted in August. It has suggested the government consider a gender budget statement (GBS) comprising cross-sectoral allocations for women across thematic areas.
Finmin, MoWCD to hold discussions soon
The ministries of finance and women and child development will soon initiate discussions on the changes suggested by the working group, people aware of the deliberations said.

The Centre's allocation for women-related schemes as presented in the gender budget increased to ₹1.71 lakh crore in FY23 from ₹14,379 crore in FY06. India introduced gender-based budgeting in 2005.
In these years, while the total expenditure budget of the government increased about eightfold, the reported gender allocation rose 12 times. The gender budget as a percentage of the total has increased from 2.8% to 4.3% during this time.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development had set up the working group in November with a mandate to study international best practices on reporting gender budget allocations and to suggest measures to strengthen the GBS and create a revised format.
The working group suggested that the process adopted for reporting must be based on gender-inclusive planning, budgeting and reviews throughout the year.
It suggested the re-introduction of a brief explanation on the purpose of the GBS besides endnotes to explain the rationale for including programmes in it, or the basis on which the budget for them has been determined.
The panel also called for more clarity on information provided in the budget and the budget circular. It suggested that the reporting by ministries can capture direct expenditure under various schemes as well as outlays by entities under their administrative control.
Countries across the world including Canada and Australia have moved to allocations for women according to the gender equality goals they aim to achieve.
The group was also tasked to develop guidelines outlining the methodology for preparing the GBS for inclusion in the Budget Call Circular.
The existing GBS format does not adequately capture gender-responsive efforts that are non-budgetary such as providing maternity leave, flexi timing and setting up internal committees for addressing sexual harassment of women in the workplace.
There is also the lack of a robust monitoring system to assess the impact of allocations in the GBS or audit mechanisms to ensure accountability.
Linking the GBS with the output-outcome framework of the government is important to link with targets and indicators, as per the group.

India's net direct tax collections rise 23.5% YoY to Rs 8.65 lakh crore in FY24 so far,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-net-direct-tax-collections-rise-23-5-yoy-to-rs-8-65-lakh-crore-in-fy24-so-far/videoshow/103765974.cms,18-09-2023,
View: Zombie firms are rising up again in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/zombie-firms-are-rising-up-again-in-india/articleshow/103742658.cms,18-09-2023,"The living dead are rising once again. After a temporary decline between 2016 and 2019,
corporate zombification
has once again been on an upward trend globally, says a recent study by Bruno Albuquerque and Roshan Iyer at the
International Monetary Fund
. This, the researchers say, leads to “congestion effects.” Healthy firms experience lower investment, employment and productivity growth as unviable rivals waste resources.
Better-quality enterprises also suffer faster exits, and new entrants are slower to arrive. “Zombie firms may cast a long shadow on the economy,” the IMF economists conclude.
That shadow crept up on India a decade ago. In 2012,
Credit Suisse Group AG
— which, as irony would have it, has itself gotten swallowed up by
UBS Group AG
— wrote an influential report about the country’s most indebted companies, titled “House of Debt.” As the house burned, and flames threatened to singe the banking system, India rustled up modern bankruptcy legislation in 2016. The monetary authority embarked on a controversial campaign to turn off life support for businesses that were too bloated and unprofitable to survive in the normal course.
However, Covid-19 changed everything. Like in many other countries, the government came in with an emergency credit guarantee for failing firms, allowing lenders to regain their footing. Post-pandemic shortages and the war in Ukraine boosted inflation and interest rates and shored up banks’ profitability. The focus on zombies went away. So much so that instead of being swiftly dispatched to corporate-obituary pages, they are once again being allowed to roam indefinitely in the twilight zone, as a source of easy revenue and cheap talent for their healthy rivals.
Take Vodafone Group Plc’s India joint venture with cement-and-aluminum tycoon Kumar Mangalam Birla. As of June 30,
Vodafone Idea Ltd
. had long-term liabilities of more than 2.2 trillion rupees ($27 billion), most of which are the wireless carrier’s deferred payment obligations to the government for spectrum. Forget rolling out a fifth-generation telecom network. The company is struggling to pay for the 5G airwaves it won in a 2022 auction. Millions of customers are deserting the service every quarter.
Live Events
India’s successful telco czars — Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Sunil Mittal’s
Bharti Airtel Ltd
. — are not complaining. And why should they? Not only is New Delhi the largest creditor to Vodafone Idea, following a halfhearted rescue, it’s also the one-third owner of the loss-making enterprise. If somebody needs to be alarmed about a duopoly emerging in a core infrastructure business crucial to productivity, then it’s the government.
But it doesn’t seem to be too perturbed. Just like it seems unconcerned about the same thing happening in the world’s fastest-growing large aviation market. Go Airlines India Ltd., with a 7% domestic passenger share, filed for bankruptcy in early May and temporarily grounded its flights, promising to be fully back by June 1. The latest update is that flights are canceled until Sept. 25 for “operational reasons.”
With every passing day, Go’s fate is looking similar to that of Jet Airways India Ltd., which collapsed under the weight of debt in 2019 and hasn’t resumed operations even after exiting bankruptcy in January. What’s the point of an insolvency law that takes in dead firms and sends out zombies?
It isn’t in anyone’s interest to ask that question right now. The status quo is working very well for
InterGlobe Aviation Ltd
., whose low-cost carrier IndiGo now controls 63% of the Indian market. Air India Ltd., privatized in 2021, also benefits, as its new owner, the Mumbai-based
Tata
Group, forges an unwieldy empire of four carriers into one. To be surrounded by weak competition means monopsony power to set wages: Why pay more for pilots when your rivals can’t pay them at all?
Until the deadwood is cleaned up, new capital will be reluctant to enter government-regulated sectors in India. Consumers may grumble, but not complain too loudly — not as long as Ambani’s Jio is wooing them to its burgeoning digital empire, and until Tata needs passengers to fill the hundreds of planes it has ordered. But lack of effective competition will ultimately show up in prices as corporate greed.
Even when it doesn’t look like the starting point for another haunted house of debt, zombification of the economy has to be stamped out, and it must be done before the next bout of “greedflation” forces future policymakers to raise interest rates — hurting investment, jobs and wages.

""Healthy advance tax numbers suggest that the
economic growth
momentum has continued in the second quarter, as suggested by various high frequency indicators,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at rating agency
ICRA
.
""It is likely that the cumulative tax revenues will display a healthier trend at end September 2023, helping soften the rise in the
fiscal deficit
relative to the year-ago period,"" she added.
Of the total advance tax collected in the first two quarters of the fiscal, corporate tax accounted for ₹2.80 lakh crore and personal income tax for ₹74,481 crore, people cited above said.
Advance tax
collections for the first half of 2022-23 were ₹2.95 lakh crore. Advance tax collections for the first quarter of this fiscal stood at ₹1.16 lakh crore.
Gross tax collections till September 15 this fiscal stood at ₹9.85 lakh crore. The government has issued ₹1.22 lakh crore as refunds so far this year.
Positive outlook
So, net tax collections stand at ₹8.63 lakh crore, up 23% year on year.
Among the minor heads, in the first half, tax deducted at source stood at ₹5.13 lakh crore, while self-assessment tax was at ₹82,187 crore including security transaction tax of ₹12,995 crore. Equalisation levy for the period was ₹1,581 crore.
""Stand-alone growth of second quarter advance tax at 20% shows continued positive outlook,"" said Rahul Garg, partner at Pricewaterhouse & Co LLP. ""Together with consistent robust
GST
, the revenue target seems to be on the right path and pace.""
The Centre has budgeted direct tax collection of ₹18.20 lakh crore for FY24, estimated to grow at 9.6%, slower than the direct tax collection growth in the last fiscal year. Budget estimate (BE) for direct tax revenue in the last fiscal (FY23) was at ₹14.2 lakh crore. It was later revised to ₹16.5 lakh crore, and still settled marginally higher at ₹16.61 lakh crore.

First, the G20 Independent Expert Group on Strengthening MDBs was established and it has submitted the first (of its two volumes) report, which recommends a triple agenda that dovetails with the call for better, bigger and more effective MDBs. Second, there is agreement to collectively work towards boosting the World Bank’s financing capacity. Here, options will be explored that will deliver a powerful boost to the IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) to support low-income and middle-income countries. Third, there is endorsement of the G20 roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations of the independent panel on capital adequacy frameworks (CAF) for MDBs. The recommendations on the CAF are focused on enabling MDBs to use their existing resources effectively. The roadmap estimates that the implementation of CAF measures will potentially yield additional lending headroom of about $200 billion over the next decade.
The 2023 International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual meeting and the G20 FMCBG (finance ministers and central bank governors) meeting, which will be held on its sidelines, will discuss the two volumes of the report of the independent expert group. The World Bank will be presenting the progress on its evolution exercise, which can set a good template for the reforms being put in place by other MDBs.
The MDB agenda is a multi-year exercise and involves the engagement of multiple stakeholders. Therefore, it is not possible to set a definitive timeline (to complete MDB reforms) at this juncture. Well-calibrated and properly sequenced strategies need to be put in place by MDBs within the respective governance frameworks, and the guidance emanating from G20 can support MDBs in this endeavour.
Q: What can we expect from the next finance track meeting under India’s G20 presidency in Marrakech?
A: The focus of the 4th FMCBG meeting, scheduled to be held in Marrakech, will be on the MDB agenda and crypto assets. Apart from this, discussions will also focus on the current global economic outlook.
Q: According to the estimate put out in the Delhi Declaration, developing nations need about $5.9 trillion to meet climate goals by 2030. How does the G20 propose to meet this requirement?
A: This massive requirement will have to be met by substantially-enhanced mobilisation of financial resources from all sources. The G20 countries recognised the need to drastically raise global investments to meet our climate goals under the Paris Agreement. They have made a call for setting up an ambitious, transparent and trackable New Collective Quantified Goal of climate finance in 2024, based on the needs and priorities of developing countries, and which can fulfil the objectives of the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and the Paris Agreement.
MDBs have a critical role in enabling the flow of resources in the required magnitude. For this, the G20 members have agreed to deliver better, bigger and more effective MDBs, including by improving their responsiveness and accessibility, and by substantially increasing financing capacity.
New and innovative mechanisms would be required to mobilise resources. The G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group has made clear recommendations on the mechanisms and instruments that could support the timely and adequate mobilisation of resources for climate finance.
Q: The declaration also talks about a Global Digital Public Infrastructure Repository voluntarily shared by G20 members and beyond. How do you plan to build it and what are the objectives behind this
plan?
The Global Digital Public Infrastructure Repository (GDPIR) is expected to be created on the basis of information on DPIs that will be shared voluntarily by G20 and beyond and will be hosted on a website.
DPI as an approach to rapidly advance financial inclusion has also been included in the new G20 2023 Financial Inclusion Action Plan developed under the Indian Presidency. This plan will lead to leveraging the broader digital infrastructure, including DPI, for advancing financial inclusion, among other things.
NPCI International Payments Ltd, or NIPL (an arm of the
National Payments Corporation of India
), aims to implement UPI-like systems globally. NIPL is globalising UPI and
RuPay
Cards mainly through three ways—by deploying UPI-like solutions; creating mutual acceptance of payment systems for person-to-merchant transactions; and interlinking the payment systems for the cross-border remittance corridor for person-to-person transactions.
NIPL is engaging with multiple Indian missions abroad to globalise the UPI payment rails. Further, NIPL has reached out to many countries for UPI and RuPay globalisation.
It has initiated engagement with central banks in more than 80 countries for UPI and RuPay acceptance and the cross-border remittance corridor. It has also executed memoranda of understanding with 26 payment partners covering 34 countries.

Finmin defends GDP growth estimates,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/finmin-defends-gdp-growth-estimates/articleshow/103699735.cms,16-09-2023,"The
finance ministry
on Friday slammed a research report that claimed that India's 7.8%
economic growth
in the April-June quarter is overstated, as it defended the official estimates, saying if anything, the growth numbers might ""understate the reality"".
This is because manufacturing growth indicated by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is far lower than what manufacturing companies are reporting, it added. In a post on X, the ministry said, ""Ideally, critics would have done well to look at several other growth indicators to see if other data match their conclusions.""
Industrial production grew 4.5% in the April-June quarter. Purchasing Managers' Indices suggest the manufacturing and services sectors are growing. Bank credit growth is in double digits. Consumption is improving, and the government has vigorously ramped up capital expenditure, the ministry stated, asserting that the economic activities remained robust.
Claiming that India is ""covering up"" the low expenditure trend, Ashoka Mody, economics professor at Princeton University, earlier this month in a column said
GDP growth
calculated via the expenditure approach stood at just 1.4% in the June quarter.
The ministry, however, countered it, saying India consistently uses the ""income-side approach"" to calculate GDP growth for various reasons and it doesn't switch between the income and expenditure-centric approaches, depending on which one is favourable.

It said a balancing figure - statistical discrepancy - is added to the expenditure approach estimate.
""These discrepancies are both positive and negative. Over time, they wash out,"" it said. In fact, in FY22 and FY23, the 'statistical discrepancy' was negative. ""In other words, growth as per the Income Approach was lower. Using the expenditure approach, it would have been higher than the 7.2% reported for FY23 and higher than the 9.1% reported for FY22,"" it said.
As for nominal GDP growth being lower than real growth, this is a ""new bogey being spread to discredit GDP numbers and indicate that underlying economic activity is quite weak"" and ""both do not stand up to scrutiny"", it said. Nominal GDP growth was lower, as the deflator is dominated by wholesale price inflation, which has been in negative zone.
""So, arguing that nominal GDP growth is more reliable because India has issues with its calculation of GDP deflator is to invent an argument where none exists,"" it said.

Kerala's revenue collection in 2021-22 decreased by 10 per cent compared to 2017-18: CAG report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/keralas-revenue-collection-in-2021-22-decreased-by-10-per-cent-compared-to-2017-18-cag-report/articleshow/103670513.cms,14-09-2023,"A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on
Kerala
's
revenue
sector for the financial year 2021-22 has found that the state's revenue collection had decreased by 10 per cent from what it was in 2017-18, while the receipts from the
Centre
had increased.
The report, tabled in the assembly on Thursday, said that during the year 2021-22, the revenue collected by the state government decreased to 59 per cent from 69 per cent in 2017-18.
At the same time, the receipts from the Centre increased to 41 per cent that year from the 31 per cent in 2017-18, it said.
The report also said that even though the revenue raised by the state government during the year 2021-22 shows an increase from the previous year of 2020-21, the percentage of revenue raised by it to total revenue receipts has reduced when compared with that of 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 financial years.
""The revenue receipts of the state increased by Rs 19,023.41 crore during 2021-22, compared to 2020-21. This was mainly due to an increase in own tax revenue by Rs 10,679.68 crore followed by the state's share of union taxes and duties by Rs 6,259.69 crore,"" it said.
Live Events
The non-tax revenue of the state saw an increase in 2021-22 mainly due to the increase in the receipts under the head state lotteries by Rs 2,261.92 crore, the report said.
The Goods and Services Tax (
GST
) collection also increased from Rs 20,028.31 crore in 2020-21 to Rs 24,169.81 crore in 2021-22 due to an increase in sales turnover of goods and services, it said.
However, that same year, the revenue collection under the State Excise decreased by Rs 489.17 crore from Rs 2,521.40 crore in 2018-19 (pre-Covid period) to Rs 2,032.23 crore.
Furthermore, the report also found arrears totalling Rs 28,258.39 crore that year which amounted to 24.23 per cent of the total revenue of the state.
""This necessitates urgent intervention from the government to clear the outstanding arrears. The arrear figures are furnished by the departments every year only at the instance of audit.
""The absence of prompt reporting of arrears to
Revenue Department
and tardy pursuance by the departments concerned for realising the arrears are the main reasons for the huge pendency of arrears,"" the
CAG report
said.
Besides that, the growth rate of revenue collection under Land Revenue also saw a sharp decline from 48.41 per cent in 2020-21 to (-) 4.56 per cent in 2021-22, it said.

India's corporate tax collections seen in line with budget estimates: Govt official,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-corporate-tax-collections-seen-in-line-with-budget-estimates-govt-official/articleshow/103660971.cms,14-09-2023,"India's corporate
tax collections
must be looked at over a longer period of time and the full-year numbers are likely to be in line with budget estimates, the country's economic affairs secretary said on Thursday.
""We should not look at few months' data and try to find a long-term trend over there... my sense is that whatever numbers are there in terms of budget estimates and revenues, those will be realised,""
Ajay Seth
told reporters.
Corporate tax collections between April and July fell 10% to 1.76 trillion Indian rupees ($21.20 billion) from a year earlier, government data showed.
This is despite healthy profit growth reported by listed Indian companies, said Madhavi Arora, economist at
Emkay Global
, in a note earlier this month. While weak collections raise concerns about possible fiscal stress, they should smoothen out later in the year, Arora had said.
The Indian government is targeting a fiscal deficit of 5.9% of GDP for financial year 2023-24.

US alone accounted for 17 percent of FDI in FY'23,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/us-alone-accounted-for-17-percent-of-fdi-in-fy23/articleshow/103611761.cms,12-09-2023,"The United States was the largest source of foreign direct investment -FDI - in
India
in 2022-23, a census of foreign assets and

of firms having both inward and outward liabilities conducted by the Reserve Bank of India showed.
The census results showed that the United states followed by Mauritius, the United Kingdom and Singapore accounted for 60 percent of the inward
FDI
in the country in 202-23. The FDI in terms of market value amounted to Rs 50 lakh crore in 2022-23.

overseas direct investment
-
ODI
- also, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were among the top four destinations accounting for 60 percent of the Rs 9.1 lakh crore invested by Indian entities in 2022-23.
During 2022-23, market value of FDI in India increased by 6.9 per cent in rupee terms, primarily due to the rise in FDI in unlisted companies, the findings of the
RBI
census showed. In terms of market value, ODI growth outpaced the growth in FDI and, as a result, the ratio of inward to outward DI stood at 5.5 times in March 2023 as compared with 6.1 times a year ago and 5.6 times two years ago.
Manufacturing sector continued to attract the largest share of FDI equity, both at market value as well as at face value. Among services, ‘information &
communication
’ and ‘financial & insurance activities’ were the major FDI recipient sectors.

The RBI has been urging banks to make the e-rupee inter-operable with UPI through a QR code, said two of the bankers quoted above.
The interoperability will allow payments to flow via already well-distributed UPI QRs, they said.
The facility, announced in June, has been activated by large banks, including
State Bank of India
, the country's largest lender.
""Interoperability of UPI QR Code with digital rupee will remove friction ... but this will not drive adoption unless CBDC payments are incentivised,"" said Sharat Chandra, co-founder of
India Blockchain Forum
, an industry collective.
The RBI and banks are also discussing ways to allow the use of e-rupee when a customer and a merchant are offline, according to two sources involved in the pilot project.
While the RBI is examining technology proposals, it hasn't approved any of them, said the source familiar with the matter.
Top private lender
HDFC Bank
is working with a technology firm IDEMIA to build a version of offline CBDC transactions for feature phones, according to two people aware of the plans.
HDFC Bank declined to comment.
CBDC's new and unique use cases such as its offline mode would facilitate transactions without network connectivity, said Akhil Handa, a top executive at
Bank of Baroda
.
""As new features get added, a gradual pickup in retail CBDC transaction volumes will follow,"" said Handa.

He was speaking at a seminar organised by

RBI may extend incremental cash reserve ratio with tweaks: Bankers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-may-extend-incremental-cash-reserve-ratio-with-tweaks-bankers/articleshow/103418382.cms,06-09-2023,"The
Reserve Bank
of India (
RBI
) may ask lenders to continue maintaining additional
cash reserves
for two more fortnights, with some tweaks to the proportion, as it seeks to keep
liquidity
tight amid high
inflation
, at least six senior treasury officials told Reuters.
The incremental
cash reserve ratio
(I-CRR) could be reduced to 5%-8% in a phased manner from the current 10%, four of the officials said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
In August, the RBI asked banks to hold an I-CRR of 10% on the increase in deposits between May 19 and July 28, withdrawing over Rs 1 lakh crore ($12.04 billion) in liquidity.
The decision is due for review by Friday.
""Liquidity surplus is around the levels that were prevailing when the decision was announced,"" a treasury head at a state-run bank said. ""So discontinuation would be quite abrupt, and the best option would be a calibrated reversal.""
Live Events
The RBI has not sought views from market participants, the officials said.
A liquidity overhang can pose a threat to the inflation outlook, RBI Deputy Governor Michael Patra said in last month's Monetary Policy Committee meeting minutes, after retail inflation jumped to 7.44% in July.
""The I-CRR is acting as an indirect rate hike and, at best, the RBI could lower the limit taking into consideration tax outflows,"" a senior treasury official at a private bank said.
Banking system liquidity surplus is currently over Rs 1.5 lakh crore amid increased government spending, from over Rs 2 lakh crore before the I-CRR move.
Any deficit that emerges later in the month due to tax outflows can be bridged through short-term variable repo rate (VRR) auctions, Citi economists Samiran Chakraborty and Baqar M. Zaidi said in a note.
The RBI could also opt to reduce I-CRR to a smaller number like 5% to augment liquidity, they added.
However, at least two large state-run bank officials said I-CRR should be discontinued as they expect liquidity to naturally drain out via the twin tax outflows in the next two weeks.
""The RBI would not like liquidity to go into deep deficit as call rates will shoot up sharply above the repo rate,"" a senior treasury official at a large state-run bank said.
Advance tax payments are due around Sept. 15, while Goods and Service Tax outflows are scheduled for Sept. 20. Traders anticipate aggregate outflows of about Rs 2.2 lakh crore to Rs 2.5 lakh crore.

In case of about 12 lakh verified ITRs further information has been sought by the Department, for which requisite communication has been sent to the taxpayers through their registered e-filing accounts.
“Taxpayers are requested to respond to such communication expeditiously,” CBDT said.
In many cases the Income tax department was unable to issue them as taxpayers have not yet validated their bank account in which the refund is to be credited.

25% target for state debt levels for the short-term; Punjab most pressurized: BoB study,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/25-target-for-state-debt-levels-for-the-short-term-punjab-most-pressurized-bob-study/articleshow/103367586.cms,04-09-2023,"Indian states need to do more to reduce their
debt levels
and bring them closer to the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management
goal of 20%, a recent study by economists at
Bank of Baroda
stated.
The study suggested debt to GDP ratio at 25% as a short-term goal and the interest to revenue receipts ratio targeted at around 15%.
“This can be a good beginning with roadmaps drawn up for various states,” the research stated.
Four states will allocate more than 15% of their revenue towards interest payments in FY24, with Punjab contributing nearly a quarter of its revenue to interest payments, the research found.
The study, analysing budget data for FY24 for 27 states, pointed that only three states in the country were closer to their FRBM target of 20% debt to Gross State Domestic Product ratio, whereas 15 were over 30%.
Live Events
“The problem is that when debt levels are high interest payments increase, which strains the revenue budget,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.
While the study placed Odisha as the best state having controlled its debt, fiscal deficit and interest payment levels. It placed Punjab as the worst, with high levels of debt, fiscal deficit, interest payment ratios and outstanding guarantees.
“Himachal Pradesh is however more vulnerable as the debt servicing ratio is high. Andhra and Telangana have the highest guarantee levels which stands out more for the former where the debt levels are also high,” the study stated.
Another area of concern that the study pointed to was the issue of contingent liabilities, which it noted was on account of subsidies for consumers.
It said that Andhra and Telangana were the most aggressive on this count, but UP, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Kerala.
UDAY scheme was launched to address this problem.
“To begin with the guarantee system needs to be relooked at again as such assurances do keep entities less responsible for their business,”
BoB
economists stated.
The study assumes importance at a time when elections to five states are due later this year, and the general elections will be held next year, where the
Narendra Modi
government will be looking to secure a third time.

"India's growth is sustainable; economy strong enough to weather high US rates, says CEA V Anantha Nageswaran",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/asset-monetisation-selloff-proceeds-should-be-earmarked-to-reduce-debt-cea/articleshow/103332230.cms,04-09-2023,"India's economy is strong enough to weather high US interest rates, chief economic adviser
V Anantha Nageswaran
tells Deepshikha Sikarwar and Vinay Pandey in an interview. The medium-term risk for the country is securing energy supplies while the merchandise trade deficit is not a concern, he says. Edited excerpts:
We had a strong first quarter. How do you see the economy going ahead in the face of several challenges? And are we kind of settling at a 6% medium-term growth rate?
Our medium-term growth is at about 6.5% -- we are comfortable with that, and in a good year, we can even be heading closer to 7%. I think private capital formation is no longer a topic of speculation. We are seeing it in bottom-up corporate cash flow data; we are seeing it in the RBI's investment intentions data that they have put out in the August monthly bulletin; and third, we are hearing it from corporates themselves as part of the quarterly earnings reports, announcements and press conferences. Bank credit growth has again picked up, including in MSME sectors and agriculture. So, I think we are comfortable maintaining a central tendency of 6.5% not only for this year but going forward. Some headwinds or others will always be there. In fact, last year, we had much stronger headwinds with commodity prices, crude prices, war, trade disruptions, etc. Services are offsetting quite a bit of the stagnation in merchandise exports. Of course, we need to see the impact of August's deficient rainfall, but we should also acknowledge the fact that we have moved a long way away from the monsoon dependency. Well, there is work to be done. However, monsoon is more of a headline and sentiment-dominated impact rather than a real impact. Water storage levels are 95% of the 10-year average and 79% of last year's average, crop sowing has been quite okay, and yesterday (Thursday), IMD said September is expected to be normal. So, in terms of FY24 growth, we still see the risks for 6.5% to be symmetric on both sides.
In terms of challenges or headwinds, high US interest rates are a significant one. How do you see that affecting us?
Ultimately, what matters to us is that within the emerging
market
space, India’s macroeconomic stability has been recognised and is being recognised by investors who walk through this room and go out. Therefore, I do not see the Fed interest rates playing as big a role as they played when we were more vulnerable. Our current account indicators are much more manageable numbers, less than 2% of GDP. Secondly, our inflation overshoot last year was far lower than the inflation overshoots other countries suffered, even advanced countries. The proof of the pudding is in the fact that the 10-year G-Sec spread to the US 10-year Treasury has actually compressed. It has come below 300 basis points rather than staying above 300 basis points. Normally, what happens is when central banks in the developed world tighten, especially in the United States, the spread -- it is like a high beta variable -- the spreads widen more than they shrink when interest rates are lowered. That has not happened in the case of India, even after the Fed chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech --the US ten-year treasury and the Indian 10-year G-Sec yield, the spread has compressed.
If anything, what we should be thinking about is the impact that higher interest rates will have on the US stock market, which has tremendously proven resilient to all kinds of shocks. Something or the other keeps the buoyancy up. Last year, towards the second half, anticipation of easing, and then now it is AI-related stocks. Therefore, the tighter financial conditions in the US have not fully materialised, mainly because of the wealth effect and the stock market buoyancy. In addition, if that tightens, then yes, there will be a spillover regardless of monetary policy stance. There will be a global spillover in terms of
asset
price correction, stock market corrections, and so on. In addition, given the much stronger, wider retail participation in India in the last 3-4 years, that might have a sentiment impact or some spending impact. However, now, nobody has quantified them, and I do not think we should overstate that risk factor. Therefore, long story short, I think the Fed, even if they hide by another 25-50 basis points, I do not see that having a significant impact on our macro outlook.

Not even any impact on currency…
I think the dynamics have changed quite a bit. If the Fed is hiking by 25 or 50 basis points from here, it might also be the case that the inflation rate in the US is proving to be stickier. Then I think the real rates of interest may still be not very high in the United States. If anything, it will further enhance the prospect of an economic slowdown in that country, and the markets would anticipate that if interest rates go up from here. So all told, I don't see these as major risk factors.
We talked about the monsoon not having as much impact as earlier. But climate change is the bigger risk…
That's a medium-term issue. The medium-term risk factors for India would be to secure energy supplies in the context of what is the global discourse on climate change and emission mitigation being the most important focus of the developed world. Fossil fuels are critical for affordable energy because people do not take into consideration the role subsidies play in renewable energy and the technological shortcomings we have yet for storage and grid stability etc. If you consider all those things, then the cost advantage of renewable energy is not there. You also have to ensure medium-term critical minerals and rare earth supplies and so on. So, we should be looking at nuclear energy, green hydrogen, and many other sources, not just renewable, as an alternative to fossil fuels. This is a transition that will take time, but we have to ensure that, in the interim, we have enough energy
supply
to grow. That, to me, is the most important policy challenge for the next 10 years.
In terms of inflation measures, you know these export restrictions have been imposed. How does it sit with the long-term export policies, especially with regard to the farm sector?
Look, there are trends, and there are fluctuations around the trend. Many countries have also imposed restrictions depending on local circumstances. So these are inevitable.
In the same vein, what about the restrictions that we have imposed on the laptops and all? How does that play out in terms of the long-term competitiveness argument, the fact that people are saying it is regressing back into the earlier regime?
I'm not sure we should immediately jump to the conclusion that they're slipping back into controls. There could be specific responses, and I think anyway industry has represented. They have deferred licensing requirements by 3 months. So, I think we should wait for MeITY and the Ministry of Commerce to take a call on this.
We have a kind of carrot-and-stick approach – PLIs and restrictions – to attract manufacturing investment. The PLI scheme has also been criticised by some that India should focus on services...
Notwithstanding criticisms and criticisms matter more than who criticises. But even from the substantial part of it, I really don't understand the arguments that India has to concentrate on services. I don't think a country of India's size needs to focus exclusively on one thing to the exclusion of the other. I think we need a manufacturing strategy, and there is scope for it. For example, even in states like
Tamil Nadu
, footwear production has come to India rather than going elsewhere. These are all part of the diversification strategy that countries and manufacturers are adopting. So, there is room for manufacturing. Second, today, global capability centres are getting located in India. That started 30 years ago with fixing bugs in software code. So, you don't become a fully-grown adult on day one. You have to come through the process, and that is how the software industry matured. Similarly, today, if you start out with assembly and a relatively lower value addition, that is how it is, and that is how it will be. It is still better than giving doles and handouts to people. Women are being employed in many of these smartphone assembling. You cannot keep on waiting for the most ideal circumstance. You have to start; you have to experiment, and that will set up its own positive chain reactions. So the criticisms are misplaced.
We just saw some concerns that Moody’s expressed on debt management. How do you see the debt situation?
India's public debt to GDP ratio hasn't deteriorated compared to the last 15-16 years. In the Economic Survey, we showed scenario analysis wherein, had the nominal GDP growth been steady at 10%, how the debt and the deficit ratios would have looked like. Between 2020 and 2022, they could have come down by another 5-7 percentage points already. Generally, if you look at the last 10 years, the deflator averages about 4.7%, close to 5%. You are looking at 6.5-7% nominal real GDP growth, and you add a 4.5-5% deflator on average; we are looking at 11-12% nominal GDP growth. The cost of sovereign debt is 7% even in these circumstances where policy rates have gone up by 500 basis points in developed countries; we are talking about a 4-5% gap between the nominal GDP growth and the nominal cost of borrowing. The last decade's growth rate was on the lower side because of all the balance sheet issues that we are familiar with. So, I think there is going to be a more meaningful reduction in India's debt ratios going forward than what the agencies are willing to acknowledge at this point. Their one important argument, which I will concede, is that India’s interest payment as a percentage of tax revenues is on the high side, yes. That is obviously a legacy of the previous accumulated debt and specifically because of the contraction that we experienced during Covid. I think what should happen is going forward, you know, the proceeds from asset
monetisation
and privatisation initiatives should be earmarked for reducing debt and bringing down the burden of interest payments on taxable revenues. Also, simultaneously, as the infrastructure and supply-side capabilities of the economy improve, the inflation overshoot problem will become less and less of a concern. That will also mean less need for monetary authorities to keep tightening as much as they did in the past. That will also reflect in the cost of borrowing for the government apart from these. So, if you consider all these things, the profile for debt and deficit ratios going forward will be far better than what the credit ratings agencies are willing to give credit for, at the moment. We are talking to them about these aspects.
We have so much evidence of tax compliance going up both on the direct and indirect side. But why is it not yet reflected in the tax-to-GDP ratio?
If you look at the tax-to-GDP ratio considering states’ numbers, for an economy at this level of per capita income, India’s tax-to-GDP ratio is not low. It is steadily rising. So long as it is steady and rising slowly, that's better. If it rises fast, you will ask the question, why should the tax ratio be rising so fast? It is a drag on economic activity -- that criticism will also arise. So, I'm rather comfortable with the slow and steady increases rather than sharp increases.
In the first quarter number, there is hardly any difference between real and nominal GDP…
It was because of the major collapse in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) from last year to this year, given last year’s big spike in commodity prices. I don't read too much into it on a one-quarter basis.
Should we be concerned about the goods trade deficit that we are running?
Overall trade deficit, if anything, has shrunk. And I think merchandise trade deficit, we shouldn’t be looking at bilateral trade deficits only. I think some of the initiatives we have taken on manufacturing and increasing domestic supply capabilities will begin to manifest themselves in the data going forward. So, at the moment, the ex-petroleum deficit is not a big concern.
In the 6.5% GDP growth that you were saying for FY24, does it factor in the domestic tighter money conditions?
The 6.5% GDP growth does take into consideration the current state of monetary policy.
What about inflation? How do you see the inflation?
Earlier in August, when the RBI had its monetary policy meeting, they updated inflation projections, and I think that sounds reasonable to me. They maintain the 6.5% GDP growth in spite of updating their inflation projection for the rest of the financial year. So that seems alright to me.
Has the recent spike in inflation pushed back monetary policy easing?
I don't comment on monetary policy.
How do you see the macroeconomic balances at present?
I'm happy with the current state of the macroeconomic parameters and the network stability we have in spite of the continuing challenges we face globally and domestically with the weather, climate change, geopolitical developments, etc. I think India has done a very good job of maintaining macroeconomic stability with reasonable prospects for economic growth.
What about crude oil? It is nearing $85 a barrel.
Definitely, it is being watched. But again, I think it is still within the tolerance band for us.
Fiscal deficit numbers at the end of July were the other higher side. How do you see them?
That is because of this emphasis being put on capital expenditure this year, but it is still lower than the last 5-year average. Again, just to remind you, we have a 10.5% nominal GDP growth assumption. Then we have a buoyancy assumption that is lower than the last 5 years or even longer-term buoyancy averages. So we are comfortable.
So, in terms of spending, we have elections coming. Do you see any pressure coming on the revenue side?
Not that I am aware of.
Do you think India would be able to deliver a strong G20 outcome based on the agenda that we put forward?
We have, in the circumstances that prevail in the world - after the breakout of the conflict in Europe -- I think we have done a good job of pushing forward the agenda of developing countries, the global South while keeping in mind the sensitivities of the developed countries on some of these issues. The key priorities for the finance track in the G20 are in the form of the multilateral development banks and institutions to prepare them for addressing not only their existing priorities, which are development and economic role, but now the new challenges that have emerged --not just confined to climate and pandemic, but even food, energy water securities, etc. Part one of the report that the independent group has brought out has gotten a good reception. Part 2 will come out at the end of September. So, I think that we have made good progress. Second, where we have made good progress is in somehow figuring out how to deal with cryptocurrencies has been a major challenge for developing countries. By getting the IMF to prepare a paper and present it in March and then now getting the FSB and IMF to come up with the synthesis paper, which is coming out soon and includes both macroeconomic aspects and regulatory aspects. That is something that the Indian Presidency has pushed forward, and it has been recognised by other countries as well. The third area where we have made good progress is with respect to Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of taxation, which has been pending for a long time. The more difficult issue has been the one of global debt because there are both multilateral considerations and bilateral considerations for some countries. Even then, some of the countries have applied for debt relief under a common framework, and they have moved forward during our Presidency. One country that was not part of the common framework because it was a middle-income country, Sri Lanka, there too India took the lead in providing financing assurance and getting IMF funding to happen. But, making progress on arriving at a common way of dealing with debt resolution across low and middle-income countries is something that requires further work. More importantly, it is not just enough to address those issues after they arise but to try to see how well it can prevent them from arising in the first place. The key item for India is the digital public infrastructure (DPI), and aligned to that is financial inclusion, which it facilitates. India has been appointed as the co-chair for the next 3 years for Global Financial Inclusion (GFI), which will also help us transfer expertise and learn from other countries’ experiences on India’s DPI and how and in what way it facilitates financial inclusion. The last item is, of course, the smart cities of tomorrow, which should take into consideration both health and climate considerations. A well-dispersed urban infrastructure will be good for handling health-related emergencies such as pandemics from spreading too quickly. But at the same time, energy security and energy efficiency require you to have concentration and scale effect. So how do you come up with criteria to help urban planners deal with both these elements? We have put forward some high-level principles that have been endorsed. So these are all tangible progress that we have made in the G20 finance track agenda.
We've seen this whole competitive populism in states going for election. What does it mean for states’ fiscal situation and the fact that when the centre is trying to push for infrastructure creation, the larger state expenditures seem to be moving towards revenue?
No, no, that's not true. I mean, these are all election-related announcements, and by the time the parties are elected, and they start implementing these things, and then after they implement them, then you can look at their fiscal impact. So right now, it is too premature to make that conclusion. All that we have seen in the data in the current financial year is that the states have also ramped up their capital expenditure, and their deficit numbers are well within the parameters that they have committed to. So I think poll promises and how they translate into actual impact on fiscal numbers, that’s a huge distance to be crossed. There is no need to presume certain conclusions at this point.

is a matter of great concern for the world, especially developing countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said, as India looks at building consensus at the upcoming
G20 summit
to evolve a tangible framework to help the debt-ridden low income economies. In an exclusive interview to PTI late last week, Modi said India's
G20 presidency
has placed a significant emphasis on addressing the global challenges posed by debt vulnerabilities, especially for nations in the Global South.
""The debt crisis is indeed a matter of great concern for the world, especially developing countries. Citizens from different countries are keenly following the decisions being taken by governments in this regard. There are some appreciable results too,"" Modi said.
""First, countries that are going through debt crisis or have gone through it, have begun to give greater importance to financial discipline,"" Modi said.
""Second, others who have seen some countries facing tough times due to the debt crisis are conscious of avoiding the same missteps,"" Modi said.
Under its G20 presidency, India has been consistently highlighting the need for a framework on debt restructuring to help countries facing mounting debt problems.

Africa is top priority: PM Modi on India's proposal for African Union's G20 membership
China
, considered to be the world's largest sovereign creditor, has been showing reluctance to certain proposals on debt restructuring although an increasing number of G20 member countries are pitching for helping the low-income nations deal with the crisis.
According to estimates, over 70 low-income countries are reeling under a collective debt burden of USD 326 billion.
""The G20 finance ministers and Central Bank Governors have acknowledged the good progress in debt treatment of common framework countries and beyond the common framework too,"" Modi said.
""We have also been greatly sensitive to the needs of our valued neighbour, Sri Lanka, during their tough times,"" he said.

witnessed nearly 38 per cent annual growth in July, taking the loan outstanding to the realty sector to a record Rs 28 lakh crore, as per the latest
RBI
data. It is evident from the
Reserve Bank
's loan outstanding data as well as property consultants data on housing sales and new launches across major cities that activities in the
real estate
sector are moving at a fast pace.
The credit outstanding in housing (including priority sector housing) rose 37.4 per cent annually in July crossing Rs 24.28 lakh crore, showed the RBI's data on 'Sectoral Deployment of Bank Credit – July 2023'.
The credit outstanding to the commercial real estate increased by 38.1 per cent to Rs 4.07 lakh crore.
Commenting on the RBI data, Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said the impressive loan growth in the real estate sector is a function of a large-scale demand revival across the board.
""The commercial office segment was reeling under the pandemic's pressure last year as employers were contemplating strategies around complete work from the office, work from home, or a hybrid model. However, as the situation gained normalcy, employees returned to offices and the demand for good quality commercial offices is high this year,"" he said.

Another set of RBI data showed that All India HPI growth (y-o-y) inched up to 5.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023-24 from 4.6 per cent in the previous quarter and 3.4 per cent a year ago.
In 2022, Puri said housing sales across top 7 cities were 54 per cent higher than the previous year. In January-June 2023, sales have already reached 63 per cent of the previous year, indicating the sustained demand.
The demand remained undeterred despite a steady rise in home loan interest rates, he added.
Samantak Das, Executive Director and Head of Research, JLL India, said the RBI's latest sectoral credit data showed a remarkably high growth in bank lending to the real estate sector in July 2023.
""This is the impact of the merger of a non-banking financial company with a bank. On excluding the impact of the merger, lending to commercial real estate in July 2023 increased by ~12 per cent y-o-y and housing loans increased by ~13 per cent y-o-y during the same time frame,"" he added.
Das said this double digit growth is considered quite robust given the challenging economic scenario globally.
""The double-digit growth can be attributed to the rising demand for housing which is reflected in the robust sales volume recorded till June 2023,"" he added.
Aman Sarin, Director & CEO, Anant Raj Ltd, said the growth in credit indicates that the real estate sector is growing and people are investing in the sector.
""This also indicates that the banking sector is positive about real estate and willing to provide capital for construction of commercial and housing projects,"" Sarin said.
Real estate developers and consultants exuded confidence that the sales momentum in the real estate sector will continue. They are also bullish about bumper sales in the upcoming festive season.
Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation, said: ""The festive season typically brings optimism and increased real estate transactions.""
The residential real estate sector is presently experiencing robust growth, and this trend is expected to persist, Jain said.
Puri of Anarock said the demand momentum is likely to continue, and the real estate sector is likely to scale newer heights.
As per the Anarock data, the total housing sales increased to 2,28,860 units during January-June this year across seven major cities from 1,84,000 units in the year-ago period.
These cities are -- Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.
This is despite the rise in interest rates on home loans by around 250 basis points in the last one and a half years and also increase in prices of residential properties after the COVID pandemic.

Pension fund regulator PFRDA plans to come out with a systematic withdrawal plan which will provide flexibility to pension account holders to withdraw a lump sum fund as per their choice on completion of 60 years.
""It is at a very advanced stage. Hopefully, it should be implemented from October and November,"" Mohanty said.
Currently, National Pension Scheme (NPS) subscribers after turning 60 years withdraw up to 60 per cent of the retirement corpus as a lump sum while the remaining 40 per cent of the corpus mandatorily goes into buying an annuity.
However, a systematic withdrawal plan will allow NPS subscribers to opt for periodic withdrawal -- either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually - till the age of 75 years.
PFRDA increased the entry age up to 70 and the exit age to 75 keeping in view longevity.
PFRDA has taken various steps to enhance financial education, empowering subscribers to make well-informed decisions and leverage the advantages of the formal financial sector while maintaining a clear understanding of associated risks and trade-offs, he said.
In pursuit of the objective to promote pension and retirement planning, he said, PFRDA annually celebrates October 1 as National Pension System Diwas (NPS Diwas).
This initiative contributes to the financial self-sufficiency of Indian citizens in their post-retirement phase, he said.
In observance of NPS Diwas this year, he said, PFRDA has planned a month-long sequence of digital media and publicity initiatives.
These endeavours are strategically designed to commemorate NPS Diwas and effectively communicate the importance of pension planning to the subscribers as well as to the general public, he said.

India's GST collections up 11 per cent to Rs 1.59 lakh cr in August,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-gst-collections-up-11-per-cent-in-august/articleshow/103272029.cms,02-09-2023,"India
's goods and services tax collections grew to Rs 1.59 lakh crore in August, up 11 per cent on a year-on-year basis, the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Friday. The collection from Goods and Services Tax (
GST
) was Rs 1,43,612 crore in
August
2022.
GST collection had seen a similar annualised jump in July, at Rs 1.65 lakh crore.
Of the Rs 1.59 lakh crore in August, CGST component was Rs 28,328 crore, SGST Rs 35,794 crore, IGST Rs 83,251 crore (including Rs 43,550 crore collected on import of goods) and cess Rs 11,695 crore (including Rs 1,016 crore collected on import of goods).
The Centre settled Rs 37,581 crore to CGST and Rs 31,408 crore to SGST from IGST. ""The total revenue of Centre and the state governments in the month of August 2023 after regular settlement is Rs 65,909 crore for CGST and Rs 67,202 crore for the SGST,"" the ministry said in its release.
ET Online

Live Events
Data shows that revenue from the import of goods in August was 3 per cent higher and the revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) were 14 per cent higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year.
With the onset of festival season, the increased consumer spending for homes, cars, vacations, and other consumer items may also ensure higher monthly
GST collections
.
Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) Chairman Bibek Debroy recently said the government was losing revenue due to the GST, which should be revenue neutral with a single rate.
""The ideal GST is one that has a single rate, and it was meant to be revenue neutral. When it was introduced, there were some calculations by the Ministry of Finance then that said, in order to be revenue neutral, the average GST rate must be at least 17 per cent.
""The average rate now is 11.4 per cent. So because of GST, the government is losing revenue,” the eminent economist said.

"India at cusp of new private capex cycle; UP, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha bagging most investments: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-at-cusp-of-new-private-capex-cycle-up-gujarat-maharashtra-odisha-bagging-most-investments-report/articleshow/103251747.cms,31-08-2023,"The Indian economy is at the cusp of a new private capital expenditure cycle, a domestic credit rating agency said on Thursday. After analysing official data from 2005 to 2022, India Ratings and Research said Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra continue to dominate fresh capex allocation, while Odisha is getting attention with projects spread across textile, steel and power sectors.
For the past few years, the government led on the investment front while private capital expenditure, which has a trickle-down effect on growth and employment, did not take off.
""Analysis of
Industrial Entrepreneur's Memorandum
(IEM) and
Business Expectation Index
(BEI) data of 2005 to 2022 shows that the Indian economy is at the cusp of a new private corporate capex cycle,"" the rating agency said in a note.
The IEM data is collected by the government's Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, while data related to BEI is released by the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) in its industrial outlook survey of corporate entities.
The agency said a recent RBI study on private capex allocations hitting a decade high in 2023-24 also illustrates a pick-up in private corporate capex.

There is a steady uptick in project allocations across all ticket sizes and there could be a significant push from large projects of over Rs 1,000 crore in this cycle, the agency said.
India's push for roads and renewable energy will continue to dominate the country's investment cycle, while recent expansions in railways and electronics suggest a more ambitious shift away from modular capex, it said.
Crude oil, base metals, power and telecom continue to dominate the capex activity, the agency said, adding that broad basing is visible with increase in capex activity across cement, chemicals, healthcare and logistics.
The textile sector witnessed significantly higher investments during FY23, but FY24 activity could remain tepid, it said.
The agency said there appears to be a correlation between IEMs and BEI, and added that except in 2009, which was impacted by the global financial crisis, the value of BEI between 2008 and 2011 remained higher than 120, indicating higher business confidence in the future of the economy.
As a result, IEM at Rs 17.36 lakh crore peaked in 2010.
On the other side, the BEI remained flat and below 115 during 2013-2020.
BEI recovered sharply to 126.2 in 2021, and to the highest level of 136.1 in 2022. This also got reflected in IEMs rising to Rs 7.71 lakh crore in 2021 from Rs 4.15 lakh crore in 2020.
The IEM amount could have been much higher in 2022 than the Rs 4.24 lakh crore, if not for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the continuing war, which led to corporate houses holding back on proposals, the agency said.

Centre's fiscal deficit up to July widens to almost 34% of FY24 target,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centres-fiscal-deficit-up-to-july-widens-to-almost-34-of-fy24-target/articleshow/103250761.cms,31-08-2023,"The Central government’s
fiscal deficit
in the first four months of FY24 stood at 33.9% of the annual target, sharply higher than 20.5% a year before, as revenue
spending
, on a year-on-year basis, doubled in the month of July on top of a sustained hike in capital spending, according to the official data released on Thursday.
The deficit, in absolute terms, almost hit Rs 6.06 lakh crore between April and July, against Rs 3.41 lakh crore a year earlier, as the government seems to have frontloaded not just capital but also
revenue
expenditure. The front-loading of tax devolution to states, too, played its part in pushing up the Centre’s deficit so far.
Capital spending jumped nearly 52% during the April-July period from a year earlier to Rs 3.17 lakh crore, higher than the budgeted annual rise of about 36%, as the government kept pushing such productive expenditure to spur economic growth.
Revenue expenditure rose 15.9% year on year until July to Rs 10.64 lakh crore, way above the targeted annual increase of 1.5%. Overall expenditure increased 22.5% to Rs 13.71 lakh crore, higher than the budgeted hike of 7.5%.
Live Events
Meanwhile, net tax revenues for the Centre dropped about 13% until July this fiscal from a year before to Rs 5.83 lakh crore. However, a doubling of the non-tax revenues to Rs 1.79 lakh crore, driven by handsome dividends by the Reserve Bank of
India
, softened the blow of the tax shortfall.
Total receipts dropped to Rs 7.75 lakh crore between April and July, against Rs 7.86 lakh crore a year before and compared with the targeted annual increase of 10.6%.
Senior finance ministry officials have already asserted that the FY24 fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of gross domestic product (or Rs 17.87 lakh crore) will be strictly adhered to even though the spending under a few schemes could vary from the budgetary outlays.
As ET has reported, the government may have to raise its budgetary spending for the rural employment guarantee scheme by about Rs 30,000 crore in the current fiscal from the budgeted Rs 60,000 crore.
Moreover, the government this week announced a Rs 200 cut in the price of cooking gas cylinders for households. It is likely to cost the exchequer more than Rs 7,500 crore in 2023-24 if the government doesn't pass on the burden to oil companies.
Analysts also expect a likely extension of the Central government's free ration scheme beyond December 2023 and higher support to farmers under the PM Kisan programme ahead of the 2024 general election.
""If the government still chooses to prioritise fiscal prudence and maintain its FY24 fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of GDP, then these measures will have to be funded through savings from other schemes or by slowing down on capex. The latter could risk a moderation in public capex in the latter part of FY24,"" according to a Nomura report last week.
Of course, the nominal GDP for FY24 is expected to rise at a faster pace than the budgeted 10.5%, which will create some additional spending leeway for the government without jeopardising the fiscal deficit target.
Fiscal position in July
As for July alone, the Centre’s capital expenditure jumped almost 15% to Rs 38,599 crore, while overall spending inched up 84.6% to Rs 3.30 lakh crore. Capital spending, which had crossed the crucial Rs 1 lakh crore mark in June, dropped sharply sequentially in July. Revenue expenditure, however, doubled to Rs 2.91 lakh crore in July, pushing up the overall spending.

Colgate Palmolive
, L'Oreal,
Castrol
,
Saint-Gobain
,
Whirlpool
,
Mastek
, Domino's Pizza, and McDonald's India, seeking tax under the pre-goods and services tax (
GST
) regime. These companies have moved various high courts and even the Supreme Court arguing that they cannot be taxed on the same item both as 'goods' and 'services'.
The states have levied
value-added tax
(VAT) on the transfer of intellectual property rights (IPRs), seeking about ₹30,000 crore in taxes for the FY11-FY15 period, people aware of details told ET. The notices were sent in the last six months.
GST, which replaced VAT and several other indirect taxes, was rolled out on July 1, 2016.
Some of those who were served these VAT notices said they had already paid
service tax
on these transactions.
The various state authorities are treating these IPRs as ""goods"" and levying VAT.
Live Events
Businesses say many, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat, have sent these notices.
""The states are aware of the post-GST position regarding the taxation of IPR,"" one of the appellants told ET. ""However, they want to augment the revenue from the past issues.""
Under the
GST regime
, 18% GST is applicable on permanent transfer of IPR if treated as a ""supply of services"" or ""supply of goods"", ensuring there is no ambiguity on the issue.
The matter is pending before the apex court.
""This is the pre-GST period demand raised by the state tax authorities and we are aware of the complications,"" a senior official of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) told ET. ""However, as the matter has now reached court, we will wait for the guideline by the court.""
'Area of concern'
Legal experts said items cannot be treated as both goods and services and taxed twice.
""The controversy with respect to dual applicability of VAT and service tax is a great area of concern for various businesses where especially the
transaction
is with respect to franchisee services,"" said Abhishek A Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who is arguing for the taxpayers against the applicability of both the taxes before the Supreme Court and Bombay High Court.
""While the taxpayers have already discharged service tax, the VAT authorities intend to recover VAT on the same transaction, thereby leading to the moot point whether the same transaction could be taxed both as goods and services,"" Rastogi said.

"Centre spent Rs 2,400 crore more than what it raised via green bonds",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-spent-rs-2400-crore-more-than-what-it-raised-via-green-bonds/articleshow/103221457.cms,31-08-2023,"The government spent about Rs 18,400 crore on various
green projects
in 2022-23, higher than its mop-up of Rs 16,000 crore through sovereign
green bonds
last fiscal year when it had floated such papers for the first time, a senior official said citing the latest estimate.
According to the
expenditure
plan prepared by the
finance ministry
for the current financial year, the
funds
raised through such bonds will be used to finance green projects worth Rs 23,764 crore, he said.
Given that the funds raised will have to be used strictly for green projects, the spending will be kept higher than the actual borrowing to assuage any apprehensions about potential misuse of such funds, officials had told ET earlier. The government could borrow Rs 20,000-22,000 crore through such green bonds in this financial year, they had said.
To be sure, the government’s overall annual budgetary spending on green projects cutting across sectors would be way above this level. But such expenditures are not strictly segregated and classified on the basis of the environment-friendly nature of the projects. However, since the government raised funds via green bonds last fiscal, it had to formally identify certain green projects to be funded by such proceeds.
About half of the green bond proceeds are expected to be deployed in railways in 2023-24, followed by projects in new and renewable energy (32%), housing and urban affairs (15%), environment and climate change (1%) and others, according to the expenditure profile firmed up for this fiscal.

Railways, new and renewable energy, and housing and urban affairs, too, accounted for a large chunk of the expenditure funded through the green bond proceeds in 2022-23.
A final announcement on the exact borrowing size through green bonds for 2023-24 will be declared in September, when the government announces its borrowing plans for the second half of this fiscal.
As for railways, the funds will be spent in the production of energy-efficient electric locomotives, among others.
Green bonds will be part of the Centre’s overall market borrowing plan for the second half of this fiscal. The government had announced that it would borrow a total of Rs 8.88 lakh crore from the market through dated securities in the first half of 2023-24, which constituted 57.6% of the full-year target.
In 2022-23, the government issued green bonds through two equal tranches of Rs 8,000 crore.
A green finance working panel, headed by chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, has been mandated to select projects from the proposals submitted by various government departments.

"Private sector capex has taken off, says Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/private-sector-capex-has-taken-off-says-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/103188833.cms,30-08-2023,"India's private sector has started to invest, and the economy will do well in the coming quarters, finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said, while exuding confidence that
India
will be able to manage the spillovers of high US interest rates.
In a freewheeling interview with ET,
Sitharaman
said Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
will return to power in 2024 with ""good numbers"" as the government had delivered on its promises.
Read the full interview with the Finance Minister here.
She said that while some items may be experiencing inflation, ""broad-basket inflation"" was steady, and
RBI
was looking at the country's needs rather than syncing its activities with other central banks.
Some individual commodities may be seeing a price surge and ""all the perishables, and also vegetables, because they are all short-duration, and because of the way the monsoon (has progressed)...it (inflation) can see recurrence,"" the finance minister said.

ET Exclusive: We know how to handle the fallout of high US rates, says Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
""But overall, I think the basket itself is steady,"" she said, adding that most central banks are becoming more considerate of growth-related concerns.
Responding to a question on private sector investment, the finance minister said the buzz at last week's B20 summit couldn't have happened if Indian companies were still hesitating. ""No, they now want to actively be in the game, also become big players - big, meaningful and impactful players, each according to their size.""
""I think the Indian private sector has come into the game...investors are coming forward, industry is coming forward,"" she said, emphatically asserting that private sector capex had taken off.
""We can think in terms of looking at (GST) rate rationalisation because once you do that it will actually benefit the user, make it simpler for the system and certainly not give room for gaming the system""
— Sitharaman on GST rates
'
Central bank
looking at needs of
domestic economy
'
Sitharaman said the economy will do well in the next quarter (July-September). An ET poll last week showed GDP may grow 7.8% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier.
""For India, this coming quarter is the quarter when people open up their purses (festive season)... you would have enough reasons to believe that the demand situation is going to only go up. So, I expect the next quarter (GDP figures) will also do well.""
Responding to a question on the interest-rate cycle in India in view of the recent vegetable-induced spike in inflation, the finance minister said India's central bank is looking at the needs of the domestic economy.
""So, to that extent, the 'high for long' may not be anywhere close to what our banks, our central bank is thinking is my understanding,"" Sitharaman said, responding to questions on the likelihood of 'high for long' interest rates in the US and the implication of such a state of affairs.
""I won't say you are sufficiently insulated or not (from high US interest rates), but I would only say I think we know how to handle either a surge or a depression coming out of it,"" she said.
The finance minister said several of her counterparts lauded India for doing a good job of ""content, conduct, and process"" at the G20 and putting out a strong agenda on four issues - debt, MDB reforms, crypto assets, and digital public infrastructure - apart from infrastructure for future cities and financing to deal with climate change.
On the
Hindenburg
report, Sitharaman said some short sellers can make a killing, but regulatory tools coming out of it can also lead to better corporate governance. ""But what I'm looking at is Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India), with what it does, is able to see the grain from the chaff. Regulatory tools, if used properly, coming out of this can lead to better corporate governance.""

India’s tax department investigating FirstCry founder for alleged $50 million tax evasion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-tax-department-investigating-firstcry-founder-for-alleged-50-million-tax-evasion/articleshow/103154740.cms,29-08-2023,"India’s tax department is probing an alleged tax evasion by founder of three Indian unicorns —
FirstCry
.com, Globalbees Brands Ltd. and Xpressbees — , according to people familiar with the matter.
The department, which India’s Ministry of Finance runs, has sent notices to founder
Supam Maheshwari
asking why he didn’t pay more than $50 million in taxes on equity transactions conducted in privately-held FirstCry, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public.
At least six investors in FirstCry, including private equity firm ChrysCapital Management Co and Sunil Bharti Mittal’s family office, have also received enquiries related to the matter, they said. Maheshwari is in conversations with the tax department to settle the probe, according to the people.
Maheshwari, spokespersons for ChrysCapital, the tax department and Mittal didn’t respond to emails seeking comments about the probe.
FirstCry had turned profitable in the financial year ended March 31, 2021, after years of losses. It is one of the few startups in India seeking to tap the IPO market after being profitable at an operational level, Bloomberg reported earlier.

Ministry of Finance asks ministries to be realistic with budgetary requests,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/ministry-of-finance-asks-ministries-to-be-realistic-with-budgetary-requests/articleshow/103146865.cms,28-08-2023,"The finance ministry has started intimating various ministries and departments to present ""realistic assessments"" of their supplementary demand for grants for this fiscal year and the budgetary targets for 2024-25, said a person aware of the deliberations.
The government will present the
interim budget
for 2024-25 in February next year, and the actual budget will be introduced after 2024 general elections, the schedule of which isn't known yet.
The finance ministry will formally start consultations in early October for the supplementary demand as well as the interim budget, he said.
""Departments are being informally conveyed to be realistic in their assessments. For instance, they should not ask for more (for this fiscal) and end up surrendering unspent funds,"" he added.

""Similarly, (for the interim budget for 2024-25) it's being expected that the departments will firm up proper expenditure projections, at least for the first half,"" he said.
Given that the precise duration of the budget session of
Parliament
isn't yet clear (due to the polls), it makes sense for the ministries/ departments to prepare estimates as precisely as possible, he indicated. The idea is to avoid any disruption in productive spending.
Finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
had presented the budget for 2019-20 on July 5, 2019, after the last general election.
The Centre may have to reassess the pace of increase in its capital spending for 2024-25, now that private capex has also started picking up. The Centre's budgetary capital spending more than doubled to ₹7.28 lakh crore in 2022-23 from the pre-Covid-19 (2019-20) levels, as it bet big on the high multiplier effect of such expenditure. The capex outlay was again raised sharply by 35.8% for 2023-24 to a record ₹10 lakh crore.
The government had raised its FY24 budget size by 7.5% from a year before to ₹45 lakh crore.
According to the latest data, the Centre's fiscal deficit in the first quarter of FY24 stood at 25.3% of the annual target, higher than 21.2% a year before.
Capital spending surged 59% on-year in the June quarter to ₹2.78 lakh crore. However, revenue expenditure eased marginally to ₹7.72 lakh crore in the first quarter.
Senior finance ministry officials have already asserted that the FY24 fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of gross domestic product (or ₹17.87 lakh crore) will be strictly adhered to even though the spending under a few schemes could vary from the budgetary outlays.

Governor Shaktikanta Das-headed Sub-Committee of the
Financial Stability
and Development Council (
FSDC-SC
) on Monday resolved to remain vigilant against any build-up in vulnerabilities in the financial system as well as in the broader economy amid uncertain global environment. With a view to strengthening and institutionalising the mechanism for maintaining financial stability, enhancing inter-regulatory coordination and promoting financial sector development, the FSDC was set up by the government as the apex level forum in December 2010.
The FSDC Sub-Committee has been set up under the chairmanship of governor, RBI. It meets more often than the full Council.
The Sub-Committee reviewed major global and domestic macroeconomic and financial developments, issues of inter-regulatory coordination relating to the Indian financial sector activities of various technical groups under its purview, the Reserve Bank said in a statement on 30th Meeting of the FSDC Sub-Committee.
It also reviewed the functioning of State Level Coordination Committees (SLCCs) in various states/UTs.
""The FSDC-SC resolved to remain vigilant against any build-up in vulnerabilities in all segments of the Indian financial system as well as in the broader economy, especially from global spillovers in a dynamic and uncertain world, and to preserve financial system stability for attaining strong, sustainable and inclusive growth,"" the RBI said.
Live Events
The meeting was attended by the members of the Sub-Committee -- T V Somanathan, Finance Secretary and Secretary, Department of Expenditure; Vivek Joshi, Secretary, Department of Financial Services; Sanjay Malhotra, Secretary, Department of Revenue; and Manoj Govil, Secretary,
Ministry of Corporate Affairs
.
Madhabi Puri Buch, Chairperson, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI); Debasish Panda, Chairman, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI); Deepak Mohanty, Chairman,
Pension Fund Regulatory
and Development Authority (PFRDA); K Rajaraman, Chairman, International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA), and Ravi Mittal, Chairman, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) also attended the meeting.
Besides, RBI deputy governors --
Michael Debabrata Patra
,
M Rajeshwar Rao
, T Rabi Shankar, Swaminathan J, and Reserve Band Executive Director O P Mall, too were present at the FSDC-SC meeting.

Reserve Bank of India's liquidity withdrawal pushes bank CD issuances to 3-month high,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/reserve-bank-of-indias-liquidity-withdrawal-pushes-bank-cd-issuances-to-3-month-high/articleshow/103134915.cms,28-08-2023,"The
Reserve Bank of India
's move to withdraw
liquidity
from the banking system has forced lenders to scout the market for funds, pushing up the issuances of
certificates of deposits
(CDs) to a three-month high for the previous fortnight.
Banks raised over 350 billion rupees ($4.24 billion) via CDs in the fortnight ended Aug. 25, data from CCIL's F-Trac platform showed. That is the highest since the two weeks ended May 19, or before the central bank withdrew the highest level currency notes.
""Most banks were caught by surprise with that move and have little option but to rely on market funding and are preferring CDs instead of going for overnight borrowing on a daily basis,"" a senior treasury official at a state-run bank said.
Earlier this month, the
RBI
had mandated that banks maintain an additional 10% cash reserve ratio for any increase in deposits between May 19 and July 28, and this led to withdrawals of over one trillion rupees from the banking system.
That, along with tax outflows, pushed the banking system liquidity into deficit for last week for the first time this financial year.
Live Events
Of the total, private lenders raised around 162 billion rupees via CDs, with
HDFC Bank
leading the pack. Following a merger with HDFC Ltd, the bank has been raising more funds via bulk deposits from the market.
State-run lenders raised around 189 billion rupees, led by
Canara Bank
.
HDFC Bank and Canara Bank did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.
""There is also a pick up in credit, which has led banks to turn to CD market for fundraising,"" said VRC Reddy, treasury head of
Karur Vysya Bank
.
Credit demand in India typically picks up from September.
Meanwhile, interest rates on these shorter tenor instruments also rose to a near four-month high.
However, it still makes sense for the banks to raise the shortfall via CDs instead of hiking fixed deposit rates, which would have a more long-term impact, said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap said.

Mizoram govt incurs Rs 4.88 crore wasteful expenditure due to negligence: CAG,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/mizoram-govt-incurs-rs-4-88-crore-wasteful-expenditure-due-to-negligence-cag/articleshow/103126792.cms,28-08-2023,"The Comptroller and Auditor General (
CAG
) of India has slammed the
Mizoram
government for incurring an ""avoidable"" expenditure of Rs 4.88 crore on formation cutting of Darlak-Sihthiang road in Mamit district due to ""negligence"".
The
CAG report
tabled in the assembly by Chief Minister Zoramthanga in the recently concluded session said that the construction of the Darlak-Sihthiang road was undertaken under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) despite the village being already connected.
It said that Sihthiang was connected by 11-km long Chuhvel-Sihthiang paved road, which is an all-weather road since December 2020.
While the construction of the Chuhvel-Sihthiang paved road was being taken up in May 2016, an agreement was signed in August 2019 between Mizoram Rural Road Development Agency of the state Public Works department and contractors for the construction of Darlak-Sihthiang road at a cost of Rs 52.81 crore and the project was scheduled to be completed by June 2020.
""The Detailed Project Report (DPR) for construction of Darlak-Sihthiang road indicated that Sihthiang village, with a population of 495 was unconnected from any part of Mamit district and the length of the proposed Darlak-Sihthiang road was 35.61 km and the estimated project cost was Rs 58.32 crore,"" the audit report said.

The contractor started the work in February 2020 and completed the formation cutting of 7.3 km in June 2021.
However, the work was put on hold since July 2021 due to non-availability of Forest clearance and the department proposed for dropping of the project to the Ministry in July 2022, it said.
Out of the contract value of Rs 52.81 crore, the
PWD
incurred expenditure of Rs 4.88 crore till April 2022.
Meanwhile, test check of records of the Executive Engineer, Kawrthah Division of the state PWD showed that Sihthiang village was connected by 11 km Chuhvel-Sihthiang paved road constructed under the
Rural Infrastructure Development Fund
(RIDF) of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with an estimated cost of Rs 9.59 crore.
This work was executed by two contractors - M/s North East Consultancy Services (NECS) for construction of culverts and protection walls at a cost of Rs. 0.93 crore starting from May 13, 2016, and V. Malsawmdawngliana for the construction of flexible pavement at a cost of Rs 7.77 crore starting from June 23, 2016 - totalling Rs 8.70 crore and was completed in December 2020.
The CAG report pointed out that the expenditure of Rs. 4.88 crore on formation cutting of this road was ""wasteful as the project was proposed to be dropped"".
The state government admitted (August 2022) that since Sihthiang village has been connected through NABARD loan, the project under PMGSY was proposed for dropping to the Ministry of Rural Development in July 2022, the audit report said.

Pradhan Mantri Jan
Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) – since its inception nine years ago, accounting for Rs 2.03 lakh crore in deposits till August 18, 2023.
“PMJDY has proved to be a catalyst for one of the biggest financial inclusion programmes for the country, with 66.8% of accounts opened in rural and semi-urban, and 33.2% accounts opened in urban communities under the scheme,"" said a
finance ministry
official.
As per the finance ministry data, 55.5% of PMJDY account holders are women, marking a pivotal move towards bridging the financial equality gap. Under PMJDY, 339.8 million Rupay cards have been issued, which come with a pre-loaded accident insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh.
""The average deposit in each PMJDY account has reached `4,069, and more than 5.5 crore of these are receiving direct benefit transfer (DBT),"" said the official cited earlier, adding that this stands as a testament to transformative financial empowerment and that with Jandhan-Adhar-Mobile (JAM Trinity), DBT is being directly credited to bank accounts, providing transparency, non-corruption and promoting digital payments through debit card.

He said if Jan-Dhan had been a pure vanilla account, people would not have shown so much interest and that it is the addition of services that has given it nuance. ""Now it has gone beyond.

"EPFO looks to reinvest its ETF money, pings Finance Ministry",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/epfo-looks-to-reinvest-its-etf-money-pings-finance-ministry/articleshow/103038220.cms,25-08-2023,"The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (
EPFO
) has started discussions with the
finance ministry
to invest all of its redemption proceeds from exchange-traded funds (
ETFs
) back into the stock market. It has proposed measures that would maximise equity returns while shielding gains from market volatility, said people with knowledge of the matter.
The central board of trustees, the EPFO's apex decision-making body, had at its meeting in the last week of March allowed the EPFO to reinvest its redemption proceeds from its investments in ETFs.
Such a measure, which would further step up the flow of retirement funds into equities, has to be approved by the finance ministry. As per the finance ministry's investment guidelines, the EPFO can invest between 5% and 15% of its income in equities and related investments.
The EPFO is seeking other changes to the
ETF
investment guidelines.
Live Events
Benchmarking returns
It has proposed the redemption of ETF units daily, linking the return threshold to government securities, against periodically now. This also involves benchmarking ETF returns to the average five-year returns of the
Sensex
against four years now, officials familiar with the development told ET.
Once the finance and labour ministries reach a consensus on the matter, the retirement fund body will move the final proposal for the finance ministry's approval.
According to one of the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, the EPFO is of the view that the holding-period return of the ETF units that are proposed to be redeemed should be higher than that on the 10-year benchmark government security by over 100 basis points.
""Further, EPFO has also proposed that the holding-period returns of the units to be redeemed should be calculated on the basis of average five-year returns of the Sensex and they must be allowed redemption on a daily basis,"" the official added.
This would benchmark ETF returns to historical long-term averages against the existing redemption period of four years, ensuring better returns for subscribers. Currently, EPFO redeems the units periodically.
The labour ministry and EPFO didn't respond to queries.
The retirement fund body began investing 5% in ETFs based on the Nifty 50 and
BSE Sensex
in August 2015 and subsequently raised the limit.
It has invested 10% of its proceeds in ETFs as of January 31, but it hopes to achieve the maximum permissible limit of 15% soon if the Centre allows it to reinvest its redemption proceeds back into the ETF.
The EPFO has an investment corpus of ₹12.53 lakh crore, of which about ₹1.25 lakh crore is in equities and related investments.

Rs 4 lakh crore
, or 1.7 per cent of their combined GSDP, in the ongoing fiscal, a domestic rating agency said in a report on Wednesday. After analysing budgets of top 11 states, which account for over three-fourths of the aggregate
Gross State Domestic Product
(GSDP),
Crisil
Ratings said the growth in social welfare schemes is expected to clock a 16 per cent jump in compounded annual growth rate between 2017-18 and 2023-24.
The revenue receipts grew by 11 per cent during the same period, Crisil said.
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala were the 11 states accounted for in the Crisil report.
""While allocation towards social welfare schemes is seen essential considering India's demography, a steady increase in the same without commensurate increase in revenues may have an impact the credit profiles of the states in the longer run,"" the agency warned.
The agency said these spends were 1.2-1.3 per cent of GSDP on an average before FY18, which has now gone up to 1.7 per cent.

""The higher growth on social welfare schemes is due to states prioritising financial assistance to certain target demographics in the form of direct transfers, pensions and cash incentives, and, in some instances, to honour election commitments,"" Crisil Senior Director Anuj Sethi said.
Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
last year slammed freebies, terming it as the ""revdi culture"", and underlined the need to end the same.
Crisil said ""social welfare"" spending does not include expenditure on
education
, agriculture, public health and other key sectors, which are budgeted separately.
Among the non-committed expenditure items, social welfare schemes have the highest share at 13 per cent of the overall amount, the agency said, adding that such spending is higher than education (10-11 per cent), power (6-7 per cent), agriculture (6-7 per cent) and public health (4-5 per cent).
It said the share of social welfare schemes in the non-committed expenditure stood at 10 per cent in FY18.
The growth in expenditure on social welfare schemes at 16 per cent per annum is higher than the 12-13 per cent growth in expenditure on
healthcare
between FY18 and FY24, which witnessed the Covid-19 pandemic, the agency said.
Revenue receipts have grown at a moderate 10-11 per cent per annum between FY18 and FY24, resulting in continuing revenue deficits for the states, the agency said.
Crisil Director Aditya Jhaver advocated for higher capex allocation towards education and health, saying it has a relatively higher impact on uplifting revenue and productivity for states in the near- to medium-term.

Government losing revenue due to GST: Bibek Debroy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/government-losing-revenue-due-to-gst-bibek-debroy/articleshow/102951018.cms,22-08-2023,"Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) Chairman Bibek Debroy on Tuesday said the government was losing revenue due to the GST, which should be revenue neutral with a single rate. Speaking at an event organised by the
Calcutta Chamber of Commerce
here, he however said that
GST
has led to a lot of simplification.
""The ideal GST is one that has a single rate, and it was meant to be revenue neutral. When it was introduced, there were some calculations by the
Ministry of Finance
then that said, in order to be revenue neutral, the average GST rate must be at least 17 per cent.
""The average rate now is 11.4 per cent. So because of GST, the government is losing revenue,"" the eminent economist said.
Debroy said the public as well as members of the
GST Council
want the 28 per cent tax rate to come down, but ""no one wants the 0 per cent and 3 per cent tax rates to go up"".
""That way, we will never have a simplified GST,"" he said at the 'Special Session on Resilient and Self-Sufficient

A ""lot of abuse"" of the GST provisions was also taking place, he said without elaborating.
On direct taxes, the EAC-PM chairman said the eventual goal of tax reforms should be the complete elimination of all exemptions.
Any exemption makes life more complicated, increases compliance costs and leads to litigations, he said.
""If the government needs to spend, it needs revenue... 10 per cent of GDP must be spent on health and education, 3 per cent on defence and 10 per cent on infrastructure. However, we as citizens pay around 15 per cent of GDP as taxes. What this means is we pay taxes at 15 per cent, but our demands and expectations from the government are to the extent of 23 per cent,"" Debroy said.
""So, whether we like it or not, either we must be prepared to pay more as taxes or our expectations cannot be like - we get airports like in the West or get railway stations like in China,"" he said.
The renowned economist also said the rate of population growth in India was slowing down sharply, and the burden of the aged will be a challenge for the country after 2035.
Social security for the aged can be managed if there is a balanced population pyramid, with young people coming into the labour force and their contributions financing the social security needs of the old, he stated.
""The annual rate of population growth now is 0.8 per cent. Beyond 2035, India will age very rapidly... Here is an example of a country like China, which will become old before it becomes rich... I want to mention that for India this is going to be a huge challenge. There are already states like Kerala where the burden of aged is exerting a very heavy toll,"" Debroy said.
He said there is a cause for concern about the nature of jobs being created in the country, and the lack of correlation between skills and education.
""We need to create about 8 million jobs per year, we are creating about 5 million. The big issue is about the nature of these jobs, which are not productive enough and of low value,"" Debroy added.

Small taxpayers need to be vigilant in checking up on GST demand notices: Experts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/small-taxpayers-need-to-be-vigilant-in-checking-up-on-gst-demand-notices-experts/articleshow/102899282.cms,21-08-2023,"Recently, the
Supreme Court
of India upheld the order of the
Patna
High Court where it dismissed a writ petition filed by a taxpayer against a
GST
assessment order.
In the case of Vishwanath Traders, the order has wide ramifications for Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), ‘small business persons’ and professionals. This occurred because several of them approach the high courts directly for remedy against a demand notice which is due to a delay in filing an appeal from their side.
Sunil Gabhawalla, founding partner of a
CA firm
, told TOI that a response (appeal) to a demand notice must be made within three months. In case of a delay, the jurisdictional appellate commissioner can be approached for seeking a one-month extension.
In case more than four months have passed, the only recourse available is to file a writ with high courts, he added.
Many small taxpayers do not keep track of of the assessment orders, which could contain significant demands and are served online through the GST portal. As a result, many times, the four-month period passes before they are aware of the demand raised.

Manish Gadia, partner at GMJ & Co, a firm of chartered accountants, said to TOI, “The process of serving notices online through the common portal first began in financial year 2020-21. Unfortunately, small taxpayers do not have the bandwidth to check the portal on a day-to-day basis. In the case of many such taxpayers, notices and demands have piled up. To make matters worse, since the past few months, bank accounts are being attached for non-payment. Typically, at this stage, the small taxpayer becomes aware of the notice.”
Not always are the emails and text messages informing the taxpayer of a demand notice (that is uploaded on the portal) sent, as per tax experts. The contacts provided by an SME/MSME are typically those of an employee. Further, high attrition means such messages do not serve their purpose.
The path of the issue raised becomes challenging with the apex court agreeing with the decision of a High Court in not entertaining a writ petition.
“Though a correct legal interpretation, the Supreme Court’s order literally closes all doors available to such taxpayers,” TOI quoted Gabhawalla.
“If the avenue of filing a writ petition is shut, the entire sum will have to be paid. More often than not, the tax demand is high-pitched and substantial penalties are imposed... plus there is an element of mandatory interest,” he added.
According to the tax experts, it is important for SMEs to be more alert in checking up on demand notices. The government may also consider amending the act to permit delayed appeals in genuine cases of SMEs and small taxpayers, TOI reported.

Under N K Singh, the 15th Commission had kept the tax devolution ratio at 42 per cent, same as suggested by the 14th Commission.
The report of the commission was accepted by the centre, and accordingly, the states are being given 42 per cent of the divisible tax pool of the Centre during the period 2021-22 to 2025-26.
Inclusion of the
fiscal deficit
, debt path for the Union and states, and additional borrowing room to states based on performance in power sector reforms were a few recommendations made by the 15th finance commission.
As per the glide path for fiscal consolidation, the government aims to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the 2025-26 fiscal.
For the current fiscal, the deficit is projected at 5.9 per cent of GDP, lower than 6.4 per cent in the last fiscal ended March 31, 2023.
He also said the government will stick to the fiscal deficit target of 5.9 per cent of the GDP as robust tax, non-tax collections will help meet the spending requirement and make up for any shortfall in disinvestment proceeds.
Although there would be a shortfall with respect to disinvestment, he said, this shortfall would be met by non-tax revenue mobilisation.
""Disinvestment target is unlikely to be met. However, I would say in aggregate the collective amount between disinvestment and non-tax revenue is likely to be very close to the
budget
,"" he said.
The total of disinvestment receipts, plus non-tax receipts are likely to be very close to the Budget Estimates, he said.
""We expect to adhere to our fiscal deficit target this year...none of the events so far have caused anything for us to deviate from it,"" he said.
The government has already got a higher dividend from the
Reserve Bank of India
and expects higher dividends from
public sector banks
and other PSUs than estimated in the Budget.
The Reserve Bank of India in May approved a Rs 87,416-crore dividend payout to the central government for 2022-23, nearly triple of what it paid in the preceding year. The government was expecting Rs 48,000 crore from the
RBI
, public sector banks and financial institutions in the current fiscal.
The dividend payout by the RBI was Rs 30,307 crore for the accounting year 2021-22. With public sector banks posting record profits of over Rs 1 lakh crore in fiscal 2022-23, the government's earnings from them are likely to be higher.

"China slowdown won't have much impact on India, says Finance Secretary TV Somanathan",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/china-slowdown-wont-have-much-impact-on-india-says-finance-secretary-tv-somanathan/articleshow/102846162.cms,19-08-2023,"The slowing Chinese economy is unlikely to have much impact on
India
and the government will continue its capex push, finance secretary
TV Somanathan
said.
On the
fiscal deficit
, he said the government will not exceed the budget estimate of 5.9% of GDP.
""So far as
China
is concerned, the very fact that we have a huge
trade deficit
with China means that China's slowdown has very little negative effect on the Indian economy,""
Somanathan
told ET in an interview.
China's economic activity data for July, released Tuesday, including retail sales, industrial output and investment, came in much below expectations, fuelling concerns over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown in growth.
Five major brokerages Friday cut China's economic growth forecast for the year as worries mounted over contagion from debt repayment troubles at its top private property developer Country Garden.

Somanathan said the government will continue with its capital expenditure push. The February budget steeply raised the capital expenditure outlay by 37.4% to ₹10 lakh crore from ₹7.28 lakh crore in FY23 to ramp up growth.
Asked if there could be a shift to revenue expenditure instead of capex because of impending general elections in 2024, he said the government will provide budgeted funds that any ministry requires.
""Capital expenditure will continue to be a priority,"" he said. ""Whatever we have planned for, in terms of the capex, will not be impacted because of the elections. The only question will be ability to spend - we have a clear policy.""
Import curbs
The government expects robust capital spending in the April-September period.
""In the first half, the offtake is going to be very good,"" Somanathan said. ""It's likely to be in the 50-60% range. We are already now, almost six months into the cycle so you can see that there is no moderation.""
With regard to criticism of the move to impose restrictions on imports of laptops and tablets, he said the government has limited policy instruments available in view of
World Trade Organization
rules.
""We should understand one thing.
WTO
does not permit tariffs on ITA (Information Technology Agreement) items,"" he said. ""So if we want to encourage domestic manufacturers in a country which has 140 crore people and will buy many crores of laptops and tablets, what policy instruments are available?""
Quantitative restrictions need to be viewed in that context, he added.
Imports of laptops and tablets will require a licence from November 1.
ITA-1 products include high-tech items such as computers, telecom equipment, semiconductors, amplifiers, scientific instruments and other devices.

Diversification of government bond holding has helped govt lower borrowing costs: Study,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/diversification-of-government-bond-holding-has-helped-govt-lower-borrowing-costs-study/articleshow/102843156.cms,19-08-2023,"MUMBAI: A strategy of lowering dominance of
banks
in the
government securities
(g-secs) banks by diversification and encouraging non bank participants such as insurance companies, pension and provident funds helped in lowering borrowing costs for the government a study by the Reserve Bank economists shows
""Scenario analysis indicates shallower increase in borrowing costs when non-banks absorb all new government debt compared to when it is absorbed entirely by banks, highlighting that
RBI
’s continued efforts to diversify the investor pool for G-Secs are well calibrated"" said a research paper by Reserve Bank economists
Amit Pawar
,
Mayank Gupta
,
Abhinandan Borad
, Subrat Kumar Seet and Deba Prasad Rath published in the central bank's latest monthly bulletin. The authors are from the Department of Economic and Policy Research. The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India.
The study reveals that nonbanks are more responsive to changes in G-Sec yields than banks. Overall, a one per cent increase in G-Sec supply is found to be associated with a 9.5 to 10 basis points increase in long term yields. Non-bank entities absorbed a significant portion of newly issued sovereign debt during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, banks still dominate the ownership of g-secs in India.
Major holders of Government securities at the end of December' 2022 include scheduled commercial banks (Rs 33.9 lakh crore), insurance companies (Rs 24.5 lakh crore), Reserve Bank of India ( Rs 13.8 lakh crore), provident funds ( Rs 4.4 lakh crore), pension funds (Rs 3.7 lakh crore), mutual funds (Rs 2.7 lakh crore), among others.
""The findings suggest that as yields rise, the demand for debt rises among both banks and nonbanks. However, non-banks exhibit slightly greater sensitivity to yield changes compared to banks"" the study said.

The study finds that as compared to banks, nonbank investors are more sensitive to changes in G-Sec yields – for a 1 percentage point increase in yields, domestic banks increase their debt holdings by 9.8 to 10.2 per cent, while non-banks exhibit a higher response, increasing their holdings by 10.8 to 11.1 per cent.
These findings highlight that the Reserve Bank’s sustained measures aimed at diversifying the investor pool for G-Secs are well calibrated and aligned with debt management objectives of cost optimisation, risk mitigation and market development according to the authors of the study.

is set to jump by over 80 per cent to Rs 1.71 lakh crore in the current fiscal, according to an article by
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI

capex cycle
.
Cleaning up of balance sheets by both corporates and banks makes room for upping lending activities, the article, which draws from the RBI's data from banks,
The paper does not represent the official position of the central bank.
""The phasing profile of the envisaged capex, based on the pipeline projects finance... suggests that the envisaged capex increased significantly to Rs 1,71,568 crore in 2023-24 as against Rs 94,876 crore in 2022-23,"" the article said.
In 2022-23 (FY23),
infrastructure
-- including power, telecom, ports and airports, storage and water management, special economic zone, industrial, biotech, IT park, and roads and bridges -- remained the major sector accounting for 60 per cent of the total cost of projects.
Live Events
Apart from infrastructure, metal and metal products, construction, textile, and food products accounted for a sizeable share in the total cost of projects envisaged in FY23, the article said.
It said about 547 projects received assistance from banks and financial institutions during FY23 with a record project cost of Rs 2.66 lakh crore as compared to 401 projects having a total project cost of Rs 1.42 lakh crore in FY22.
Of the total FY23 project cost, about 33 per cent (Rs 87,997 crore) was expected to be spent in FY23 itself while 34.7 per cent (Rs 92,539 crore) is likely to be spent in FY24 and another 24.8 per cent (Rs 66,071 crore) in the subsequent period, the article said.
Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha,
Maharashtra
, and Karnataka accounted for 57.2 per cent share in total project cost in FY23, higher than their 43.2 per cent share in FY21, the article said.
In FY23, Uttar Pradesh accounted for the highest share (16.2 per cent) in the total cost of projects sanctioned by banks/financial institutions, followed by Gujarat, Odisha, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, it said.
The article warned that higher cost of capital because of the rate hikes by central banks, including the RBI, geopolitical tensions-led global uncertainties and risk of a slowdown in major advanced economies, can hamper investment activities.
""The investment cycle appears to be poised to gain momentum going ahead, but, its sustainability needs to be watched closely,"" it added.

Urban poor most impacted in July inflation surge: Crisil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/urban-poor-most-impacted-in-july-inflation-surge-crisil/articleshow/102775772.cms,16-08-2023,"Urban
poor have been the most impacted by 15-month high consumer price
inflation
(CPI) in July, a domestic rating agency's arm said on Wednesday. The high-income segment in urban areas faced the lowest inflation burden, as food has a relatively low share in their consumption basked,
Crisil
Market Intelligence and Analytics said in a note.
""Poorest segment in urban areas faced highest inflation rate in July,"" said the note, released days after official data said that the headline inflation accelerated to 7.44 per cent for July.
""The poorest segment in both urban and rural areas faced a higher inflation burden than their high-income counterparts, as food inflation accelerated sharply,"" the Crisil note added.
Crisil said it used data from the
National Sample Survey Organisation
(
NSSO
) and mapped the expenditure baskets of three broad income groups - the bottom 20 per cent, middle 60 per cent and upper 20 per cent of the population - with July inflation.
The overall CPI inflation for the bottom 20 per cent income earners in urban areas came at 8.5 per cent in July against 7.9 per cent for their rural counterparts, the note said, adding that the same numbers had stood at 4.9 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively, in June.
Live Events
As compared to this, the degree of change for the top 20 per cent income earners between July and June was more subdued, the note showed.
The CPI for the top 20 per cent income earners in urban areas increased to 7.1 per cent in July from 5 per cent in June, while for the rural segment, it went up to 7.3 per cent from 4.9 per cent.
The high-income segment in urban areas faced the lowest inflation burden, as food has a relatively low share in their consumption basket, the note said.
Within the poor people, the poorest segment in urban areas faced a higher burden than their rural counterparts as both food (12.3 per cent in urban against 11 per cent in rural) and fuel inflation (4.4 per cent versus 3.3 per cent) were higher in the former than the latter, the agency said.
Meanwhile, the rating agency also upped its FY24 overall CPI estimate to 5.5 per cent from the earlier 5 per cent following the release of the July data.
The extent of the sharp rise in July came as a surprise, it said, adding that early signs are pointing to a minimum relief in August.
""The higher-than-expected inflation reading and continued food price pressure, despite a softening core, put monetary policy in a dilemma,"" the note said, admitting that typically the rate-setting panel overlooks supply-side shocks like the current one.
It expects the monetary policy committee to hold rates at its next meeting in October and cut rates only in the early part of next fiscal.

India first imposed windfall profit taxes on July 1, 2022. It imposed tax on crude oil producers and extended the levy on exports of gasoline, diesel and ATF, joining a growing number of nations that tax super normal profits of energy companies.
While duties were slapped on the export of petrol, diesel and jet fuel (ATF), a Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED) was levied on locally produced crude oil.
The government reviews the windfall tax fortnightly, and the last revision was effective on Aug 1.

Irelia had bid Rs 5,625 crore for acquiring the franchise rights for IPL’s Ahmedabad team.
While this investment doesn’t qualify under the government's definition of the I&B sector, it is part of the media and entertainment (M&E) ecosystem, which comprises films, TV, music, sports, print, radio, digital media, and gaming.
Walt Disney-owned Lucasfilm Entertainment Company infused Rs 160 crore into its India unit Lucasfilm Visual Effects India during the March quarter.

ARC Body calls for safeguards against filing of criminal cases,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/arc-body-calls-for-safeguards-against-filing-of-criminal-cases/articleshow/102660196.cms,12-08-2023,"The
Association of Asset Reconstruction Companies
(ARCs) has sought the finance ministry's intervention to issue advisory to state governments to direct authorities to build in adequate safeguards in initiating criminal cases against lenders and its officials while pursuing their duty as per prescribed recovery norms.
The letter follows an increasing number of criminal cases against lenders, which are aimed to intimidate and stall recovery efforts. The industry has raised concerns over criminal action against ARC officials despite their merely following due process of law as mandated in IBC and Sarfaesi.
Under Section 32 of the
Sarfaesi Act
, lenders have been given protection for action taken in good faith. It specifies that no suit, prosecution, or other proceeding can lie against the
Reserve Bank
, Central Registry, or any secured creditor or any of its officers for anything done under provisions of Sarfaesi.
Despite this, creditors are being implicated in various criminal charges by borrowers and related vested interests to delay and derail the recovery process and create a sense of fear in follow up and recovery of bad loans and pressurise the ARCs.
In keeping with the spirit of this provision, ARCs want the government to issue appropriate advisory to relevant authorities to exercise restraint in initiating criminal cases against individual employees of creditors who are merely following a permissible recovery mechanism in compliance with law. However, only when mala fide intent and criminality in conduct of the officials or the institution is established beyond doubt, a criminal case against an institution or individual pursuing legitimate avenues of recovery or resolution should be filed.

(MDBs) are facing increasing demands from donor and borrowing countries to expand their lending operations beyond their core development mandates.
An independent expert group, steered by finance commission chairman NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers, formed to examine ways to strengthen MDBs has recommended tackling global challenges alongside core MDB missions of poverty reduction, tripling the sustainable lending level by 2030 and improving capital adequacy for MDBs by infusing funds.
""Implementing these recommendations within each MDBs governance framework can significantly enhance their capacity to address diverse financing challenges in the future, with a focus on the priorities of the
Global South
,"" finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
said. She was delivering the keynote address on the G20 Finance Track
National Event
titled ""Seminar on the Global Economy: Challenges, Opportunities and the Way Forward"".
Sitharaman also touched upon debt issues for vulnerable economies which she said possess significant economic risks to the sustainable development of these economies. ""The Indian G20 presidency has placed great importance on the management of
global debt
vulnerabilities, demonstrating a commitment to voicing the concerns of the Global South,"" she said.
The international community must collaborate and find stronger ways to coordinate debt restructuring for low income and vulnerable middle-income countries facing debt distress,"" Sitharaman said.

World Bank mulling local currency lending in countries like India: Official,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/world-bank-mulling-local-currency-lending-in-countries-like-india-official/articleshow/102656384.cms,11-08-2023,"The
World Bank
is mulling
local currency lending
in countries like India to help borrowers save on costs, a senior official said on Friday. ""How do we do local currency lending for a country like India is also something we are trying to think of at a price which is advantageous to this country,""
Anshula Kant
, the Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank, said.
Speaking at the event on global economy organised by the
Ministry of Finance
and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as part of India's G-20 presidency, Kant said the Indian government has a ""huge advantage"" in local currency borrowing as compared to the World Bank, even though the Washington DC-based multilateral bank is rated AAA.
In some countries like the ones in Africa, which do not possess market infrastructure from where the bank can borrow, the bank may not adopt the local currency lending strategy, Kant said.
At the event, Chief Economic Advisor to the Government of India V Anantha Nageswaran said global inflationary pressures are easing more than expected.
He said persistence of core inflation globally continues to be a cause of concern and added that there is a need for coherence between fiscal and monetary policies.

Slowdown in delinquencies to make MSME lending attractive: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/slowdown-in-delinquencies-to-make-msme-lending-attractive-report/articleshow/102656110.cms,11-08-2023,"Lenders could see new opportunities in the MSME segment as the delinquencies in this segment are slowing. Moreover, new to credit is driving demand according to credit bureau
Transunion Cibil
.
Delinquency rates excluding legacy accounts with DPD beyond 720 days have gradually declined over the last three years, the credit bureau said. It fell to 2.4 per cent in the March 2023 quarter from 2.9 percent in the same period a year ago. Credit demand picked up 33 per cent in the same period. But data indicates lenders are reluctant to lend as credit supply contracted 1.6 percent.
Delinquency rates dropped across all the three lender categories, public sector banks (PSBs) at 3.0%, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) at 3.6% and with private banks being the lowest at 1.4%, the credit bureau said.
“The progressive reforms introduced by the government for the MSME sector resurgence have borne fruit as reflected in the vigorous business activity and improved credit uptake in micro and small segments ”said Sivasubramanian Raman, chairman and managing director,
Sidbi
.
The emerging demand and business conditions should prove conducive to the lenders. “Bridging the demand-supply gap is a priority call-to-action for lenders. With rising demand, improved credit performance and promising economic growth prospects, the time is conducive for lenders to expand their MSME credit portfolios” said Rajesh Kumar, managing director and CEO of Trans Union Cibil.

Indicating the potential to lend to
MSMEs
, the credit bureau pointed out that India has approximately 630 lakh MSME entities of which only 250 lakh have ever availed credit from formal sources. The number of MSME entities is estimated to have touched 750 lakh by March 2023. Of these, around 500 lakh are expected to be new to credit (NTC) MSMEs. ” Lenders can tap into this vast segment by identifying deserving NTC MSMEs, connecting with them and customizing credit products for their requirements ” Kumar said.
Data released by the credit bureau indicates that public sector banks are leading the MSME loan originations in the `micro' segment where credit exposure is less than Rs 1 crore. Such loans rose 23 percent year-on-year growth in originations value while the `small' segment, where credit exposure is between Rs 1 crore to Rs 10 crores, grew at 1%. However, originations value in the ‘medium’ segment, where credit exposure is between Rs 10 crore to Rs 50 crore fell by 19% year-on-year.

"India expects production-linked payouts to rise to Rs 13,000 crore this year",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-expects-production-linked-payouts-to-rise-to-130-billion-rupees-this-year/articleshow/102641197.cms,11-08-2023,"India
expects production-linked incentive payouts to manufacturers to rise to at least Rs 13,000 crore this year, a top trade official said on Friday.
Under the $24 billion scheme, the federal government pays local manufacturers when targets such as sales are met, aiming to boost investment in manufacturing. Targets differ from sector to sector.
Launched in 2020, the programme covers 14 sectors, ranging from electronic products to pharmaceutical drugs and is crucial to boosting jobs in manufacturing, an area where India has struggled.
Part of the scheme's $24 billion incentive amount which doesn't get utilised might be redirected to some other sectors or in reworked schemes, Rajesh
Kumar Singh
, secretary of the trade ministry's department for industry and internal trade promotion told reporters on Friday.
Reuters reported earlier this month that India's top bureaucrat reviewed the scheme, amid a push from industry for faster payouts.

Income Tax Dept seeks more time for international cases,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/income-tax-dept-seeks-more-time-for-international-cases/articleshow/102621169.cms,11-08-2023,"The taxman is trying to buy time as a large number of cases related to international taxation and contentious
transfer pricing
matters hang in the balance.
It has requested the tax tribunal, a quasi-judicial authority, to adjourn hearings on such cases till the Supreme Court rules on the matter, according to an internal tax office communique, sources told ET.
If the Supreme Court subsequently upholds a recent Bombay High Court order (or an earlier Chennai High court order), then several tax matters, which are currently before the
Dispute Resolution Panel
(DRP), would become time-barred under the tax law and the
Income Tax
(I-T) department would be unable to recover any tax from these claims.
The DRP, comprising three dedicated I-T commissioners, is an independent forum that takes a view on the draft assessment order passed by the tax assessing officer. The panel, which serves as an alternative mechanism to resolve differences, has to give directions within 9 months from the end of the month in which an assessee receives the draft order.
The law also requires the assessing officer to issue the final assessment order within 24 months from the end of the relevant assessment year in cases where transfer pricing assessment is made.
Live Events
Now, according to the Bombay High Court ruling on August 4, 2023 - the order that drove the department to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (
ITAT
) - the time limit of 9 months is included within the 2 years that is available for completion of the final assessment order.
Typically, draft assessment orders in a large number of cases are issued close to the completion of the deadline for the final assessment. Under the DRP mechanism, an assessee has to move the DRP within a month of the draft assessment order, following which DRP has to issue its directions within 9 months, and, then, the assessing officer completes its assessment in 30 days in line with the panel's directions.
Under the circumstances, an assessee, armed with the Bombay HC ruling, would be in a position to claim that the order of assessing officer is bad in law as the two-year time limit has already lapsed.
Faced with such a situation, the international taxation division of the Mumbai I-T office, in a letter dated August 8, 2023, has said, ""In view of the wide ramifications and huge tax implications of the above order the Revenue is in the process of seeking stay on the operation of the said order (i.e, the Bombay HC order) from the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Till this prayer of the Revenue is decided, the department representatives (DRs) have been instructed to file adjournment requests in pending matters which are impacted by the aforesaid decision. In view of the same it is requested that such requests of the DRs may kindly be considered favourably."" The letter, signed by the chief commissioner (I-T), west zone, is addressed to the vice-president, ITAT-Mumbai.
A predominant number of transfer pricing disputes, one of the complex areas in tax law, is dealt by the tax department's Mumbai circle which accounts for almost 30% of the country's I-T collections.
The letter to ITAT spells out that the Bombay HC order in the case of the Shelf Drilling Angel Ltd and others has adjudicated ""on the interplay between the timelines prescribed under Section 153 and 144C and has held the provisions of section 153 are not excluded even for orders that come within the ambit of Section 144CC.
""Even prior to the Bombay HC order, adjournments were sought before ITAT by departmental representatives in all cases where grounds of appeal included the ground relating to order being time barred based on the decision of Chennai HC in case of M/s. Roca Bathroom Products Private Limited. This will again result in a backlog of cases involving transfer pricing and international taxation issues before tribunal unless the Hon'ble Supreme Court decides the matter on priority,"" said Siddharth Banwat, a chartered accountant.
Section 153 of the I-T Act deals with the time limits for completion of assessment, reassessment and re-computation while Section 144C, introduced in 2017 to bring in greater accountability in the tax assessment process, dwells on the procedure of the draft assessment order and the role of the DRP.

According to the response, EPFO does not invest directly in individual stocks including stocks of any
blue chip
company.
“EPFO invests in equity markets through ETFs replicating BSE-SENSEX and NIFTY-50 indices,” the minister said.
“EPFO has also invested from time-to-time in ETFs constructed specifically for disinvestment of shareholding of the government in body corporates,” the minister added.
The retirement fund body may seek government approval for investing the proceeds from ETFs in any permissible asset class to maximise returns. The central board of trustees of EPFO approved the proposal in its last meeting in March this year.
EPFO began investing in equities through ETFs in 2015-16 with a 5% exposure with the cap raised to 10% in 2016-17 and 15% in 2017-18. However, the equity investments are yet to touch the 15% ceiling despite better returns on investments.

Indian firms' funding costs from FPIs to rise by up to 40 bps: JP Morgan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indian-firms-funding-costs-from-fpis-to-rise-by-up-to-40-bps-jp-morgan/articleshow/102608044.cms,10-08-2023,"Changes to India's
withholding tax
regime will increase borrowing costs for Indian companies raising money from foreign investors by about 30 to 40 basis points, analysts at J.P.Morgan said on Thursday.
Corporate Research analyst Aman Aggarwal said the change could pose some downside risk to the supply of funds, as issuers could tap the onshore market that can provide decent liquidity at competitive rates.
""Companies that will be affected mostly include Indian renewable names. Most of the Indian renewable bond structures involve an offshore Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that issues USD bonds and on-lends the proceeds to onshore subsidiaries,"" Aggarwal said.
He added that costs would increase by about 10 to 20 basis points for Mauritius-based SPVs.
Currently, Indian firms can raise funds from overseas investors through External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) and Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPI). The tax change affects the latter.

Transactions worth Rs 1.3 lk cr completed under Natl Monetisation Pipeline in FY23,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/transactions-worth-rs-1-3-lk-cr-completed-under-natl-monetisation-pipeline-in-fy23/articleshow/102570167.cms,09-08-2023,"Transactions with aggregate monetisation value of about Rs 97,000 crore and Rs 1.3 lakh crore were completed during 2021-22 and 2022-23 respectively in terms of accruals or private investment under the
National Monetisation Pipeline
, minister of state for planning Rao Inderjit Singh said in response to a question in
Lok Sabha
on Wednesday.
The government had launched the
National Monetisation
Pipeline (NMP) in August 2021 to enable accelerated creation of infrastructure in the country. NMP estimates aggregate monetisation potential of Rs 6.0 lakh crores through core assets of the central government, over a four-year period, from FY 2022 to FY 2025.
According to the response, monetisation of assets identified under NMP is envisaged either through structured public private partnership (
PPP
) framework or through capital market-based instruments.
The detailed structure is normally finalised on a case-to-case basis in accordance with extant guidelines and regulations subject to appraisal and approval by competent authority, the minister said.
“State-wise monetization details are not being maintained under NMP with linear assets typically falling across a number of states,” the minister said.

NMP only covers
brownfield
assets of identified statutory entities, public sector enterprises and other undertakings within the purview of ministries or departments under the government.
The top five sectors (by estimated value) capture 83% of the aggregate pipeline value and includes roads (27%) followed by railways (25%), power (15%), oil & gas pipelines (8%) and telecom (6%).
The key imperatives under the monetisation framework includes monetization of ‘Rights’ not ‘Ownership’ with assets handed back to the government at the end of transaction life. It involved brownfield de-risked assets, and stable revenue streams. Further, structured partnerships under defined contractual frameworks and performance standards are set for each identified project.
This includes selection of de-risked and brownfield assets with stable revenue generation profile with the overall transaction structured around revenue rights.
The primary ownership of the assets under these structures, hence, continues to be with the government with the framework envisaging hand back of assets to the public authority at the end of transaction life.

"Government lost Rs 1 lakh crore in taxes in FY'21 due to corporate tax cut, says MoS Finance",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/government-lost-rs-1-lakh-crore-in-taxes-in-fy21-due-to-corporate-tax-cut-says-mos-finance/articleshow/102544590.cms,08-08-2023,"The government lost a little over Rs 1 lakh crore in 2020-21 on account of a cut in corporate taxes, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said on Tuesday. In September 2019, the government announced a cut in base
corporate tax
for then existing companies to 22 per cent from 30 per cent; and for new manufacturing firms, incorporated after October 1, 2019, to 15 per cent from 25 per cent.
Companies opting for these new tax rates had to forego all exemptions and incentives. The effective tax rate for existing units, after considering surcharges and cess -- such as
Swachh Bharat
cess and education cess, which are levied on top of the income and corporate tax rates -- is 25.17 per cent as compared to 34.94 per cent earlier. For new units, it is 17.01 per cent as against 29.12 per cent previously.
In a written reply in the
Rajya Sabha
, Chaudhary had said the estimated revenue loss (due to reduction in corporate tax) in FY 2020-21 has been reestimated to be Rs 100,241 crore.
In February, the Minister had informed
Parliament
that the revenue loss in 2019-20 fiscal due to reduction in corporate tax rate from 30 per cent to 22 per cent was Rs 1,28,170 crore.
As per the corporate tax collection data shared by Chaudhary, in fiscal 2022-23 the provisional revenues stood at over Rs 8.28 lakh crore, higher than over Rs 7.12 lakh crore in 2021-22.

CAG asks Finance Ministry to put in place online Customs refund system,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cag-asks-finance-ministry-to-put-in-place-online-customs-refund-system/articleshow/102542238.cms,08-08-2023,"The Comptroller and Auditor General (
CAG
) has asked the
Finance Ministry
to consider having an online system for processing customs refunds along the lines of the
GSTN system
to make it more efficient. The official auditor has also flagged ""inordinate delays"" in the implementation of the module for daily updation of exchange rate and asked to make the system operational at the earliest.
Under the
Customs Act
, refunds can be claimed in cases where the imported goods are found to be defective or not in conformity with the specification agreed upon, when the goods are exported after payment of the export duty/cess and the exported goods are returned to the exporter.
A refund can also be claimed by a person who has paid duty on assessment of imported goods and applies for refund of duty consequent on remission /abatement of duty due to pilferage/damage of goods.
""The Ministry may consider having an online workflow for capturing and processing refunds on the lines of the GSTN System so that the Department is able to electronically keep track of BEs against which refund has been applied for. This would make the monitoring of refund cases more efficient, effective and transparent,"" CAG said.
The CAG observed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs in February 2014 stated that testing of a module for daily update of exchange rate through message exchange with
State Bank of India
(SBI) had been completed and commissioning of the same can be decided only after the technical issues with
SBI
get resolved.

Subsequently, the module has been redesigned and the final 'Go-Live' prerequisites are being completed by SBI.
The CBIC determines the rate of exchange of conversion of major transactional foreign currencies generally after every 14 days on a regular basis and issues Notifications (Non-Tariff).
If import and export are made at rates other than the foreign currencies mentioned in the notification, then the importer/exporter has to produce a certificate of exchange rate on the day of filing of bills of entry/
Shipping Bills
from the SBI.
The CAG said implementation of a system which captures daily fluctuation in the exchange rate, will minimise the undue benefit or loss to importers and exporters and correspondingly to the Department.
""The module for daily updating of the exchange rate may be made operational at the earliest,"" the CAG said.

In the first four months of this fiscal, Karnataka clocked a 20% growth rate, leaving all other large states behind, though Maharashtra has been ahead in absolute collection numbers. Maharashtra clocked a 18% growth rate, while Tamil Nadu registered 18%, Telangana 13% and Andhra Pradesh 9%, growth rates.
Karnataka’s commercial taxes commissioner C Shikha told ET that the increased growth rate has been due to better compliance by tax payers. Her department too, in addition, has ramped up enforcement activities by using system based analytics to identify cases.
MoS Finance
Pankaj Caudhary
informed the
Lok Sabha
on July 31 that the monthly average gross
GST
collection for the fiscal years 2021-22 and 2022-23 have shown 30% and 22% year on year growth, respectively.
In
direct tax collection
too, Bengaluru is neck and neck with Delhi as the city has recorded a blistering growth in income tax collection in the five-year period to 2022-23. Reports quoted tax officials saying the start-up ecosystem and expansion of tech sector in Bengaluru leading to new jobs and increase in pay have fattened the tax kitty. In fact, in 2021-22, Bengaluru beat Delhi to emerge as the second highest
direct tax
paying city after Mumbai.

G20 sherpa Amitabh Kant-led panel moots rehab package by states for stalled housing projects,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/amitabh-kant-led-panel-moots-rehab-package-by-states-for-stalled-housing-projects/articleshow/102433963.cms,04-08-2023,"New Delhi: A high-level panel chaired by
India
's
G20
sherpa
Amitabh Kant
has said Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (
IBC
) should be used as a ""measure of last resort"" for the resolution of real estate cases. Instead, it has suggested, a
rehabilitation package
from state governments including a ""zero period"" for payment of dues among a slew of steps to provide relief to home buyers stuck with
stalled projects
should be considered first.
The 14-member panel also pitched for a subsidised interest rate scheme and a guarantee fund to encourage financial institutions to fund the many stalled projects.
The panel mooted financing for the completion of stalled projects to be treated as 'priority financing' as per the report seen by ET.
In its several recommendations categorised under seven separate heads, the panel also recommended banks and financial institutions be permitted to finance fresh housing loans for new buyers purchasing unsold inventory in such stalled projects. This would ensure the flow of funds to stalled projects from the inventory of unsold flats.
The report has been submitted to the
ministry of housing and urban affairs
(MoHUA) that set up the committee to suggest measures for the rehabilitation of legacy stalled real estate projects.
Live Events
The report noted that the primary reason for stress in the real estate sector was the lack of financial viability of projects.
Accordingly, it suggested that all stakeholders including developers, financiers, and land authorities will need to take haircuts to make projects financially viable.
The MoHUA will prepare a detailed scheme based on the recommendations for the finance ministry's consideration, the report notes.
It suggested sweeping changes to IBC including permitting resolution professionals to transfer ownership of apartments to buyers during resolution process and allowing registration of apartments where possession had been granted.
The report suggests that the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (
RERA
) be allowed to bypass builders in stressed projects and collect payments from buyers directly that can then be paid off as per the 'waterfall mechanism' prescribed.
As per the waterfall mechanism recommended by the committee, revenues will first be used to complete construction. Previous dues of financial institutions and land authorities and other authorities should be treated on a pari-passu basis for taking haircuts.
""No cash flows will be shared with the original promoter till the project is completed and entire dues of financial lenders and land authorities are paid fully,"" it said.

PLI on track; investment commitments at 60% of capex target: SBI MF research,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/pli-on-track-investment-commitments-at-60-of-capex-target-sbi-mf-research/articleshow/102396790.cms,03-08-2023,"The investment and production in the government’s production-linked incentive scheme will start meaningfully only from the current year, said economists at
SBI Mutual Fund
in a note on Friday, highlighting that the scheme is on track with the government receiving investment commitments of 60% of the
capex target
.
“Investment commitments in auto has overshot government expectation while on the other hand, investment commitments have underwhelmed government’s vision for
ACC
, textile, and mobile electronics,”
SBI
MF economists stated, pointing out that Rs 2.9 lakh crore of investment commitments had been received against the perceived capex target of Rs 5 lakh crore.
Even though the amount accounts for 8% of the annual capex of corporates and 3.6% of the gross fixed capital formation in the country, the researchers noted that investment could lead to positive externalities--attracting more investors in other sectors.
“In the near-term, expansion of the manufacturing capacity could drive the import bills and trade deficit higher. In the long run, it could be instrumental in increasing manufacturing activity and sustainably reducing the current account deficit in
India
a few years down the line,” the note stated.
However, the researchers pointed out that the scheme has had a limited impact in attracting global manufacturing players. “Domestic listed and unlisted companies add to 24% and 70% of
PLI
participants, respectively,” they noted.

“Product choices could have been more comprehensive or exhaustive for speciality steel, KSM/API (key starting material/active pharmaceutical ingredient) and telecom instruments,”
While the SBI MF researchers said that continuation of the scheme could have a “significant impact on Indian macro, export, and overall current account dynamics five to ten years down the line,” they also noted that competition from other nations and a regime change with new policies could act as challenges to the scheme.

India's road map for $5-trillion economy focusses on growth and ‘all-inclusive welfare’: Finance Ministry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/road-map-for-5-trillion-economy-focusses-on-growth-and-all-inclusive-welfare-finmin/articleshow/102316785.cms,01-08-2023,"The government’s road map for turning India into a $5-trillion economy focusses on growth at the macro level and complementing it with ‘all-inclusive welfare’ at the micro level, the
finance ministry
said on Tuesday.
In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for finance
Pankaj Chaudhary
said the road map also relies on a “virtuous cycle of investment and growth”. It also promotes the digital economy and fintech, technology-enabled development, energy transition and climate action, Chaudhary added.
“The government has also focused on a capex-led growth strategy to support economic growth and attract investment from the private sector, increasing its capital investment outlay substantially during the last three years,” Chaudhary said.
The
International Monetary Fund
had earlier said the size of the
Indian economy
will increase from about $3.5 trillion in FY23 to over $5 trillion in FY27.
The central government’s capital expenditure has increased from 2.15% of gross domestic product in FY21 to 2.7% in FY23. “This strong push given by the government is also expected to crowd in private investment and propel economic growth,” he said.

for FY24 has taken further steps to sustain the high growth of the economy, he said. These include a substantial increase in capital investment outlay for the third year in a row to a record Rs 10 lakh crore (3.3% of GDP).
“Direct capital investment by the Centre is also complemented by grants-in-aid to states for the creation of capital assets. The ‘Effective Capital Expenditure’ of the Centre was accordingly budgeted at 13.7 lakh crore (4.5% of GDP) for 2023-24,” the minister said.

The government has settled Rs 39,785 crore to CGST and Rs 33,188 crore to SGST from IGST.
The total revenue of Centre and the States in the month of July 2023 after regular settlement is Rs 69,558 crore for CGST and ₹70,811 crore for the SGST.
""The continuous increase in GST collections is a sign for the board to now consider the proposal of rate rationalisation for various goods and services for the benefit of the consumers,"" said Parag Mehta, Partner, Indirect Tax, N.A. Shah Associates.
With the onset of festival seasons in the next two-three months, the increased consumer spending for homes, cars, vacations, and other consumer items is also ensuring higher monthly GST collections, he said, adding that the strong GSTN network has ensured detection of tax evaders at early stages.

Despite several representations from businesses, the income-tax department refused to extend the date for filing tax returns.
Officials, however, said that the
tax department
will offer relief in penalty for those taxpayers who could not file their returns because of genuine difficulties.
Despite witnessing huge traffic on the last date, the tax portal largely operated smoothly and the I-T department was actively assisting taxpayers for
ITR
filing, tax payments and other related services through calls, live chats, WebEx sessions and social media.
In case a person fails to file returns by July 31, he/she can file a belated return by December 31, 2023, but with a fine of ₹1,000 for income between ₹2.5 lakh and ₹5 lakh and a penalty of ₹5,000 for income over that. Also, those who fail to file returns till the due date cannot carry forward many losses, like business and capital losses for set off in subsequent years. Additionally, an interest of 1% per month shall be charged till the date of filing belated ITR.

The seven-year glitch: Inside the govt's war to plug the GST leakage,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/the-seven-year-glitch-inside-the-govts-war-to-plug-the-gst-leakage/articleshow/102166404.cms,27-07-2023,"As the Goods and Services Tax (GST) enters its seventh year — it was launched in June 2017 — the government is doubling down on plugging leakages in the tax system. The biggest disrupter of India's business and economy in recent times, the GST has now stabilised but needs its own medicine. It was launched to remove inefficiencies in the earlier tax regime, and it has done that very well. Now it needs to remove its own inherent inefficiencies that cause leakage of tax.
In all these years, while the GST regime was stabilising, tax evasion grew. The GST evasion is on the rise with about 14,000 cases detected in 2022-23, up from 12,574 in 2021-22 and 12,596 in 2020-21. The evasion detection doubled to over Rs 1.01 lakh crore in 2022-23, while the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) officers made a recovery of Rs 21,000 crore during the fiscal. In 2021-22, DGGI, the investigative agency under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, detected evasion of over Rs 54,000 crore and made a tax recovery of over Rs 21,000 crore.
What the robust collections tell us
At the time of introducing the GST in 2017, the revenue collection from indirect taxes stood at Rs 7.19 lakh crore at the national level. With the implementation of GST, the revenue has now gone up to Rs 18.1 lakh crore. Similarly, since the introduction of GST, the number of taxpayers increased from 67 lakh in 2017 to 1.4 crore in 2023. In April this year, GST collections stood at Rs 1.87 lakh crore, the highest ever monthly collection since the introduction of GST six years ago. Collection of Rs 1.5 lakh crore every month has become a new normal.
While post-pandemic recovery of business activity and the resilience of India's economy have driven the GST collections up, another significant reason is the government's anti-evasion measures and efforts to increase compliance.

DGGI busts fake GST bill operator gang
While buoyant collections in themselves point at the widening tax net and the efforts to curb evasion, the evasion has progressively gone up. It was Rs 3 lakh crore in the six years since the GST was introduced and Rs 1 lakh crore in the last year. The growing evasion, in fact, indicates the scope for further growth of GST collection. More efforts to plug the leakage will yield even higher collections. Since the GST regime has stabilised, it now needs streamlining. That's why the government has in the past few months waged a war on evasion by launching various efforts.
The war on GST leakage
The GST officers are using data analytics to ascertain if the entire supply chain in a particular sector is paying adequate GST or if there is a missing link. This is aimed at catching evasion at the initial stage itself so that compliance improves. They are using 'end-to-end' analytics for a sector and 'gap analysis' of the taxes paid in a supply chain. The data analysis includes comparisons of the tax payment profile of a particular sector vis a vis the erstwhile excise and service tax regime.
DGGI has been empowered with numerous technology tools to identify high-risk sectors that are not capturing the true value addition in the entire supply chain leading to pilferage of taxes, according to an expert.

Some insurers gave fake bills when quizzed on ITC: Probe
The modus operandi adopted by fraudsters included short payment of tax by undervaluing taxable goods and services, wrong availment of exemption notifications, wrong availment of the input tax credit, non-payment of tax on supply of taxable goods and services (clandestine removal), and fraudulent availment of the input tax credit on the basis of invoices from fake firms.
In May, under a special drive to detect fake GST registrations, Central and state GST officials started door-to-door physical verification of addresses before initiating any action. On receipt of data from GSTN, a time-bound exercise of verification of the suspicious GSTINs was done and if after detailed verification, it was found that the taxpayer was non-existent and fictitious, then the tax officer initiated action for suspension and cancellation of the registration.
In many cases, officials found forged electricity bills, property tax receipts and rent agreements were used as proof of principal place of business to obtain GST registration.
The flaw at the heart of the GST

Fake GST bill racket worth ₹1,000 cr busted by DGGI
The most critical pending GST reform is upgradation of the GST Network to prevent fake supplies and fraudulent claims of Input Tax Credit (
ITC
). Even after six years, the GSTN is unable to connect the supplies in a value chain, resulting in significant revenue loss to the government and causing problems for honest businesses, according to the Global Trade Research Initiative.
A current flaw in the system allows buyers to claim ITC without actually receiving supplies from fraudulent suppliers. Let's take the example of E-Rickshaw: Firm A produces batteries with an 18 per cent GST, costing Rs 100. Firm B places an order for one battery, paying Rs 118 to Firm A.
In a legitimate transaction, Firm A keeps Rs 100 and deposits Rs 18 as GST. Firm B claims an ITC of Rs 18 on this supply, which can be used to pay GST or obtain cash refunds for exports. However, in a fraudulent transaction, Firm A issues invoices without actually supplying the battery or paying tax. Yet, Firm B still claims ITC based on the information provided by Firm A.
A move is in the works to curb instances of fake invoicing, which is used to wrongfully avail ITC with no actual supply of goods or services. The GST Council is likely to decide on a new rule in GST law under which businesses would be required to explain the reasons for excess input tax credit (ITC) claimed or deposit the amount with the exchequer, the PTI reported early this month.
Geotagging and biometrics
The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is looking to further strengthen the process of Goods and Services Tax registration by using geotagging for verification. The board is also planning to use biometric authentication for the existing registration, which it found suspicious or risky.
The GST officials often find that an office place is created just for verification and later it vanishes. To prevent this, the geotagging location of the office of an entity will be made mandatory.
The board has already initiated a pilot in some states to geotag the address for the exact location. Geotagging functionality is being rolled out in phases, and as of now, is only available to taxpayers registered in Delhi and Haryana.
Under another measure, in cases of suspicion, the registration already done can be subjected to biometric authentication. Currently, officials establish the identity of the person via OTP-based authentication using Aadhaar and PAN. The authorities are now doing biometric authentication so that they can be absolutely certain that the person is the same whose Aadhaar card has been used. The move comes after the two-month drive against fake GST registration in which the authorities detected rampant misuse of PAN and Aadhaar for fake GST registration.
How the PMLA will help
Early this month, the government empowered the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to formally seek from the Enforcement Directorate information relating to any case the latter may be investigating or information in its possession.
The GSTN runs its own Business Intelligence and Fraud Analytics (BIFA) tool which started in 2019 with the help of
Infosys
. This is intended to provide intelligence inputs to state and central GST authorities with advanced analytics to detect frauds in the administration of GST.
With additional inputs from ED, GSTN can further leverage its own data and generate actionable information for agencies, such as the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, working to plug GST frauds. The PMLA has been widened in recent months with more reporting agencies included in sharing of information related to tax evasion, terror funding and money laundering.

Credit rating is an independent assessment of the creditworthiness of a business or government entity in general terms with respect to specific financial obligations such as a new bond issue.
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, there has been an increased scrutiny on credit rating agencies (
CRA
) due to concerns over their role in the crisis. The need for enhanced oversight became evident, and regulatory bodies across the globe responded by implementing significant reforms. In the last few years, the regulatory environment for credit rating agencies has become more robust, with regulators focusing on independence, transparency and disclosure and increased oversight for increasing investor confidence. Additionally, the integration of Environmental, Social and
Governance
(ESG) considerations into credit rating frameworks has further improved transparency and risk assessment.

To plug the gap in making the system robust, SEBI also came out with a new framework for CRAs working in India, involving ratings of securities having explicit credit enhancement features. The new framework, became applicable from January 1st this year, is aimed again at enhancing transparency and improving the rating process. CRAs are allowed to give the suffix ‘CE’ (credit enhancement) while rating of such instruments having to enable investors understand the extent of credit enhancement provided by a third party.

Further, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have gained significant prominence in the financial world as investors increasingly considering them while making investment decisions.
SEBI has not specifically mandated that CRAs must consider ESG factors in assessing credit risk. SEBI regulations, under code of conduct for CRAs, required that CRAs must monitor closely all relevant factors that might affect the creditworthiness of the issuers.
The assessment encourages entities to manage and respond to environmental, social, and governance challenges, allowing credit rating agencies to better capture the long-term sustainability and resilience of businesses.
A significant change introduced is the
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
(BRSR) Core. Mandated to enhance the reliability of ESG disclosures, the report contains comprehensive information about a company's approach to addressing ESG concerns and its impact on stakeholders. The
BRSR Core
empowers investors to make better-informed decisions, taking into account a company's commitment to sustainable practices and responsible business conduct.
With the aim to further boost transparency, SEBI has also asked credit rating companies to disclose lists of issuers who are non-cooperative with them. The action follows the regulator's observation that the number of issuers that are non-cooperative with CRAs have increased over the time and a vast majority of them are being unlisted and small entities. They are asked to disclose information about these entities starting from July 15, 2023. Further, every CRA is required to carry out periodic reviews of all published rating during the lifetime of the securities, unless the rating is withdrawn. It lays the foundation for more transparency in credit rating regime in India.
The regulatory environment for credit rating agencies has undergone significant improvements, leading to a more transparent and reliable credit rating process. The reforms have positively impacted the business and investment environment by boosting investor confidence, mitigating risks, and improving borrowing terms for companies. They align with the growing trend of responsible and sustainable investing. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, credit rating agencies are committed to upholding the highest standards of independence, transparency, and accountability to foster a robust financial ecosystem and improving Indian credit rating ecosystem.

Rajya Sabha
provided details of the number of Hindu Undivided Families (
HUF
) availing tax benefits (in the form of deduction under Chapter VIA of the
Income-tax Act
) during the last five years.
To a question on whether the government has assessed the impact of the Uniform Civil Code on tax benefits to HUFs in the country, the minister said: ""No such assessment has been made as there is no such Code at present"".
Currently, a debate is going on about the status of the HUFs, following the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code on which the
Law Commission
has invited comments from the public.
Under Hindu Law, a HUF is a family comprising all lineally descendants of a common ancestor, including wives and unmarried daughters. This provision also covers Jain and Sikh families.
The Income Tax Act accords 'legal person' status to HUF and entitles them to all
tax deductions
under Chapter VI-A. HUFs are taxed at the same rate as individuals, and they can claim applicable deductions.

Impact of climate shocks can make management of inflation difficult: RBI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/impact-of-climate-shocks-can-make-management-of-inflation-difficult-rbi/articleshow/102108944.cms,25-07-2023,"The impact of climate shocks and uncertainties surrounding it can make measurement and management of
inflation
and anchoring of inflation expectations difficult, the
Reserve Bank of India
said, calling out all
stakeholders
for a coordinated effort to protect the economy from shocks.
Climate change
poses a threat to long-term growth and prosperity of a country and has the potential to create shocks to monetary stability, growth, financial stability and the safety and soundness of regulated entities,
RBI
deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao said.
""To ensure a successful transition to a sustainable future, we need a multi-faceted approach that involves governments, private sector entities, financial institutions, civil society organizations and the public,"" Rao said at a panel discussion on climate implications for central banking on July 19 in New Delhi, organised by the IMF and Center for Social and Economic Forum.
RBI shared the copy of his comment Tuesday.
In India, rising temperatures, heat waves and changing rainfall patterns can also affect crop yields resulting in higher or, at times lower prices of some of the agriculture produce. This may lead to uncertainty in their prices for both - producers and consumers, creating difficulty in inflation management, he said.

The climate related shocks also impact lenders by changing the prices of assets, which they may have financed or taken as collateral. Such loans may turn non-performing, impacting the bank’s capacity to lend further.
""The transition risks, if not managed properly, could also lead to sudden fall in asset prices of the carbon-intensive assets or increase in the
risk
premia, or both, making them unattractive to hold and perhaps creating larger ripples across the financial markets. On the other side, the prices of green assets may rise disproportionately creating a bubble-like situation,"" Rao said.
He underscored the need for large-scale capacity building to equip central banks, financial firms, real economy players to understand, assess and plan for the climate issues and related financial risks. ""Only then would they be able to innovate, make strategic decisions, mobilise
capital
and build effective transition plans for achieving sustainability targets. One very important aspect of this capacity building is going to be the handholding of the smaller firms and MSMEs to make it easier for them to navigate the transition,"" the deputy governor observed.

In value terms, Rs 2,000 notes in circulation have come down to Rs 84,000 crore as on June 30 from Rs 3.56 lakh crore on the day of the announcement of withdrawal on May 19.
RBI said 87 per cent of the notes returned have been deposited in bank accounts by public while the remaining 13 per cent were exchanged by them in other denominations.
The minister further said that according to RBI, the withdrawal was a currency management operation planned to avoid any inconvenience to public or any disruption in the economy.
Further, withdrawal of Rs 2000 banknotes has been factored in, in the current year's requirement and sufficient buffer stock of banknotes in other denominations is being maintained across the country to meet exchange / withdrawal requirements.
The Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes were introduced on November 10, 2016 to expeditiously meet the currency requirement of the economy post demonetisation of all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes in circulation at that time.

Foreign assets become a tricky terrain in income tax return filing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/foreign-assets-a-tricky-terrain-in-itr/articleshow/102061581.cms,24-07-2023,"Mumbai: As the July 31 tax deadline approaches (amid hopes it may be pushed back due to the rains), many professionals, businessmen, and diaspora members who have returned are trying to figure out ways to disclose certain
foreign assets
to avoid an encounter with the taxman.
Many were, and some still are, oblivious of the price of not disclosing overseas stock options which have been vested but not exercised, ongoing
retirement
schemes like 401(k) in the US, and beneficial interests in offshore companies.
Amid a spate of notices in the last one year from the income tax (I-T) department, after it stumbled upon information which were missing in the IT returns (ITRs), these well-heeled taxpayers are being cautioned by tax practitioners and advisors.
UNDISCLOSED ESOPS & 401 (K)
""Many infotech sector employees, who are back from the US, have their funds invested in the 401 (k) plans. Now, the foreign assets (FA) schedule in the
ITR
form has no specific column for sharing details of such funds. The only option is to report them as ""any other
capital
asset"", but here one needs to give details of the date of
acquisition
and amount of total investment. However, for 401(k) plans, there is no one date of acquisition as the amount had been invested every month while the person was working in the US. Also, what people have is the present fund value, not the amounts invested. Many people are not even reporting these funds in the FA schedule which may have serious consequences,"" said Manish Dafria, a chartered accountant. Failing to disclose an asset in the FA schedule, introduced a decade ago, could trigger a penalty of ₹10 lakh while not reporting any income for tax could mean forking out 120% of the tax amount.
Even if a person decides not to report stock options as they have not been exercised, the I-T department may nonetheless come to know about them from overseas authorities as the financial entity holding the stock option accounts could disclose the name of all 'beneficiaries'. So, like the 401 (k) plan, it may be safer to report even those stock options (from foreign employers) whose vesting period may have just started.

How to report your foreign income, share investment while filing ITR form?
As per the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Common Reporting Standard Rules, 401 (k) is a non-reportable account for financial institutions. ""It is similar to the NPS account in India. So, under the exchange of information mechanism, foreign governments would not report 401(k) accounts to India. But since schedule FA requires one to report all kinds of foreign assets, 401(k) is considered a reportable account. Though, technically, a 401(k) account is maintained through a financial institution, which, in turn, invests in bonds/stocks, it falls under the category of 'equity and debt interest held'. But since it is not specifically covered, one may report it as 'other assets' held outside India,"" said Siddharth Banwat, partner at a large CA firm.
Many taxpayers are also unaware that they should separately apply to the I-T department to ensure that the amounts accruing in the 401 (k) account are taxed only at the time of withdrawal.
BENEFICIAL INTEREST
The FA schedule requires an assessee to spell out its 'beneficial interests' in overseas assets.
""Say, an individual has invested less than 10% capital in a UK company, which has further invested less than 10% capital of a German company. As per the overseas investment regulations under FEMA, the UK company has no 'control' in the German company and hence such indirect investment in the German company would not require any reporting to the
RBI
. However, it may still be subject to reporting requirements under Table B of Schedule FA,"" said Harshal Bhuta, partner at the CA firm PR Bhuta & Co.
On the one hand, not disclosing could mean holding back some of the information on beneficial interests; on the other hand, reporting it could invite a notice from the department as the tax office software detects that there is no matching
remittance
for investment in the US company. More importantly, in case of multiple stepdown investments, how many layers does one report?
FINANCIAL YEAR Vs CALENDAR YEAR
What's also worrying is the possible mismatches between the information in the ITR (based on income and transactions in a financial year) and the information received by the I-T office from foreign governments which share data pertaining to a calendar year. Say, someone who bought shares of a Nasdaq company in January 2023 and sold in March 2023, will pay capital gains tax but not report the assets while filing ITR for FY23.
""There will be certain incomes (earned between January and March 23) that will be offered to tax in return for AY 2023-24, but the assets and incomes will be reported in next year's return (AY 2024-25) as they would get covered in the next financial year. This period mismatch may result in queries from the
tax department
as income would have already been offered in a prior year (AY 2023-24),"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at the law firm Khaitan & Co.
Mehta feels that though there would be practical issues in reporting the exact date of acquisition in 401 (k) accounts (given the frequency of contributions and accruals), the conservative view would be to report the date (or, dates) from which contributions began.
""When it comes to offshore assets, one must be ultra-cautious, considering the adverse implications. The general rule that must be followed is 'report when in doubt',"" he said.

Stating that staying away from GST will not benefit trade, Sitharaman said the officials must adopt two prone-strategies to assist the assessees of plains (urban) and reach out to the people living in far-flung areas to make them understand about the GST's advantage.
""Large companies don't trade with small companies who don't have GST registration"", she said, adding the
Customs
has a role to play in facilitating trade between the state and Bangladesh.

"Inflation set to overshoot RBI's target in July, August on high vegetable prices: Nomura",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/inflation-set-to-overshoot-rbis-target-in-july-august-on-high-vegetable-prices-nomura/articleshow/102019316.cms,21-07-2023,"Consumer price inflation
is expected to overshoot the Reserve Bank's tolerance mark of 6 per cent again in July and August due to the sky high
vegetable prices
, a Japanese brokerage said on Friday. The government, which banned non-basmati rice exports earlier this week, is likely to usher in more supply-side measures to tame the price rise going forward,
Nomura
said in a note.
""We expect continued supply-side interventions, with
inflation
likely to be above 6 per cent levels in July and August, buoyed by sky-high vegetable prices,"" Nomura economists said.
Last year, inflation had been above the 6 per cent mark -- the upper tolerance level under the flexible inflation targeting set up -- for over three quarters at a go. This led to
RBI
writing an explanatory note to the government explaining the reasons for the price rise being above the set threshold.
The
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) started its efforts to tame inflation with rate hikes and upped the repo rate by a cumulative 2.50 per cent in policy actions from May 2022 to arrest the price rise.
Earlier this year, the central bank paused its rate hike cycle to pay attention to growth, and many analysts expect a prolonged pause in policy rates before it starts cutting interest rates.

The Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) rose to 4.81 per cent in June from 4.31 per cent in May, driven by a spike in food prices.
Nomura said the rice inflation rose to 12 per cent in June from 9 per cent earlier, and daily data is suggesting a further rise in the prices in July as well.
The government had imposed a 20 per cent export tax on non-basmati rice in September last year, and with the latest move, 42 per cent of the rice exports are now banned, Nomura said.
According to the note, the late arrival of monsoons and its uneven spread is disrupting paddy sowing which, as of mid-July, is 6 per cent lower right now.
""It (the export ban) also marks the latest in a series of supply-side interventions, highlighting inflation as a political priority, with state elections in Q4 2023 and general elections in Q2 2024,"" the brokerage said.
Further, it said that India accounts for 40 per cent of the global rice exports and that the ban will have an impact on global prices.
Thailand can gain through the Indian move because the South East Asian country is a net rice exporter. Among the rice importing nations, Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia could be impacted by the move, it added.

EBRD makes a case for multiple multilateral banks with diverse approaches,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/ebrd-makes-a-case-for-multiple-multilateral-banks-with-diverse-approaches/articleshow/101982370.cms,20-07-2023,"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development or
EBRD
has made a strong case for multiple
multilateral banks
with different approaches that complement each other.
The London-based multilateral lender is also eyeing deepening its engagement with the Indian private sector looking to invest in countries of its operation, its president Odile
Renaud-Basso
said.
“It is useful to have different
MDBs
because each one has a different perspective,” she told ET on the sidelines of the two-day
G-20 finance ministers
and central bank governors meeting here.
She said MDBs can be more specialised with special focus on a particular geographical area. “You can work more closely with countries and authorities and have more presence on the ground... I think different models complement each other quite well,” she said.
Her statement comes amid debate on whether there was a need for multiple development banks.

India has identified MDB reforms as a key focus area during its G-20 presidency and has tasked an expert panel headed by leading economist
N K Singh
and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers to look into it. The first part of the report was presented at the two-day meeting that ended Tuesday.
Renaud-Basso said different MDBs can have different approaches and perspectives.
She said India is a shareholder in EBRD and the country also has a large manufacturing sector and EBRD is keen to enhance its engagement. “We want to continue to work to enhance our partnership with India and Indian companies on investing in our countries of operation,” she said.
On MDB reforms, she said there had been a lot of work already on improving the efficiency of the use of capital of MDBs.

Renaud-Basso noted that the capital adequacy framework report, which was issued last year on how to make the best use of capital, has already triggered enhanced capacity.
“Monitoring and ensuring that this gets implemented is one of the focuses of the G-20. MDBs, like the EBRD, have taken that very seriously. We have already made some changes in our article of agreement,” she said.
She said the latest report from the expert panel is on the table and it would be interesting to get the reaction and feedback from the G-20.
She said one of the challenges that the lender faces is development of bankable projects. “That is a challenge because you need to have the right policies, the right level of ambitions of the country to be able to finance projects,” she said.

Aware of concerns of visually impaired but issuing new banknotes huge task: RBI to HC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/aware-of-concerns-of-visually-impaired-but-issuing-new-banknotes-huge-task-rbi-to-hc/articleshow/101955096.cms,19-07-2023,"The
Reserve Bank of India
on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court while it acknowledges the concerns of visually impaired persons regarding identification of currencies, introducing new banknotes was a monumental task that is time-consuming and also entails heavy expenditure.
The
RBI
, in an affidavit filed in the HC, maintained the process of introducing a new series of banknotes is an ""extremely complicated and time-consuming process"" extending over a period of six to seven years.
The affidavit was filed in response to a petition by the
National Association of the Blind
(NAB), claiming new currency notes and coins issued by the central
bank
posed difficulty for visually-impaired people in identifying and distinguishing them.
The matter is being heard by a division bench headed by Acting Chief Justice
Nitin Jamdar
. The affidavit said the process adopted before introducing new series of banknotes involves multiple considerations, including incorporation of visually impaired-friendly features, security, and design features to make them counterfeit deterrent.
""The RBI is aware of and acknowledges the concerns of the visually impaired persons regarding identification of banknotes. The work on the next series of banknotes has been underway since 2017,"" it said.

""Introducing a new series of banknotes is a monumental task. This has to be thought through carefully because having multiple series of banknotes of different sizes and features of the same denomination would cause more confusion than resolve the problem,"" the affidavit noted.
The central bank pointed out that the expenditure that would be incurred in introducing a new series of currencies would be high. The affidavit said the annual expenditure towards security printing was pegged at Rs 4,682 crore.
""This annual amount was not for introducing a new series but merely for printing notes to replace old, soiled, damaged notes and to meet the incremental demand of banknotes,"" it said.
The cost of introducing a new series of banknotes will be much higher and will include expenditure towards adaptation of paper production, printing machines and the entire currency dispensation and processing eco-system to any proposed changes, the document said.
The RBI urged the HC to dismiss the NAB's petition with cost claiming it has taken all necessary steps in studying the grievance highlighted in the plea and was examining the matter with due seriousness.
On Wednesday, NAB advocate
Uday Warunjikar
sought the court to not dispose of the plea and said the RBI has not made a positive statement in its affidavit.
RBI counsel Venkatesh
Dhond
said the petitioner has a unipolar thought but the central bank has to consider several points. Dhond sought further time from the HC for the banking regulator to consider the issue. The division bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Jamdar then posted the matter for further hearing after 12 weeks.
The RBI affidavit pointed out that central banks across the world generally change the design of banknotes and introduce new security features once in a decade primarily to make counterfeiting difficult.
The RBI also follows the same policy but the periodicity is not fixed and is dependent upon several factors such as number and quality of counterfeit notes detected, existence of other perceived threats to the security of the national currency and changes in national policies, it said.
The affidavit maintained the last time a series of banknotes were introduced was in 2016 and this was preceded by an elaborate process of consultation among various stakeholders.
""This process included the constitution of a design committee in 2010 comprising field experts to make recommendations on the design/size of the new series of banknotes, including making them sensitive to the requirements of the differently abled persons,"" it said.
""Considering the needs of the visually impaired persons, features such as intaglio, identification marks, bleed lines and so on have been included in the banknotes in addition to the difference in size of various denominations though the same were reduced from the earlier series to make them aligned with international norms and to make them more wallet friendly,"" the RBI said.
The process also involves taking feedback from representatives of two national-level associations of visually impaired and to ""the extent feasible, their concerns will be factored in the next series of banknotes"", said the affidavit.

"Withdrawal of Rs 2,000 notes pushes deposit to six-year high of Rs 191.6 lakh cr in June: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/withdrawal-of-rs-2000-notes-pushes-deposit-to-six-year-high-of-rs-191-6-lakh-cr-in-june-report/articleshow/101869828.cms,18-07-2023,"Withdrawal of
Rs 2
,000 notes by Reserve Bank on May 19 and the subsequent near total return of the currency to the system has buoyed deposit accretion to a six-year high of Rs 191.6 lakh crore in June, according to a report. Earlier this month, the
RBI
said more than three-fourths of the total 3.62 lakh crore of Rs 2,000 bank notes have come back to the system by way of
deposits
(over 85 per cent) and the rest as note exchanges.
According to Sanjay Agarwal, a senior director with
Care Ratings
, deposits witnessed a healthy on-year growth of 13 per cent to Rs 191.6 lakh crore, which is the highest in the past six years (since March 2017) in the fortnight ending June 30, partly supported by the withdrawal of the Rs 2,000 currency notes and higher interest rates on deposits.
Deposits rose 13 per cent in the reporting fortnight and sequentially, it expanded by 3.2 per cent to Rs 191.6 lakh crore and in absolute terms, deposits rose by Rs 22 lakh crore in the trailing 12-month period when it had stood at Rs 185.7 lakh crore.
As a result, the spread between credit and deposits growth dropped to 326 basis points in the reporting fortnight as against 875 bps in November 2022, which was the largest. This can be attributed to a rise in deposits in the last two to three fortnights.
This has had the short-term weighted average call rate (WACR) rising to 5.94 per cent as of June 30 from 4.3 per cent as of July 31, 2022, primarily due to the elevated policy rates. The WACR had peaked at 6.69 per cent as of May 4, 2023.

Meanwhile, credit offtake continued to remain elevated at 16.2 per cent on-year to reach Rs 143.9 lakh crore for the reporting fortnight ending June 30 driven by personal loans, NBFCs and agriculture & allied activities. In the same period last year, credit pickup was 14.5 per cent.
The outlook for credit demand continues to be positive due to rise in capital expenditure on the back of the production linked incentive scheme, and retail credit push. However, it is still expected to moderate from 15 per cent in FY23 to 13-13.5 per cent in FY24.
The credit/deposit ratio has been generally trending upward since the later part of FY22 and generally hovering above 75 per cent since December 2022. For the reporting fortnight, it stood at 75.1 per cent expanding by 210 bps on-year from July 1, 2022, due to faster growth in credit compared to deposits.
However, on a sequential basis, it dropped by 40 bps from June 16, 2023. On the other hand, the incremental C/D ratio declined to 63.7 per cent as of June 30, 2023, compared to 99.2 per cent as of July 1, 2022.
The share of bank credit to total assets rose by 54 bps to 67.3 per cent in the fortnight to June 30, 2023 due to higher
credit growth
. It also expanded by 20 bps from the immediate fortnight. Investment to total assets fell by 21 bps to 26.7 per cent in the fortnight due to slower growth in investments. Meanwhile, it also declined by 46 bps from the immediate fortnight.

In the meeting, the Chief Minister pointed out that revenue from these departments has increased in the past four years due to the implementation of transparent policies and the ushering in of reforms along with loopholes getting plugged.
Regarding the transport department, Reddy directed officials to implement the best vehicle tax policies by incorporating reforms and implementing new policies after assessing tax policies from other states.
The new policies should be the best in the country to encourage vehicle buyers, he said, adding that revenue generating departments should involve the district collectors more while implementing the policies.
He observed that the finance department and others should hold a review meeting with district collectors regularly to strengthen the revenue generating mechanism, plug loopholes and create awareness on existing policies.

Govt may raise up to Rs 22k crore through green bonds in FY24,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/govt-may-raise-up-to-rs-22k-crore-through-green-bonds-in-fy24/articleshow/101737087.cms,14-07-2023,"India
is likely to borrow about Rs 20,000-22,000 crore through sovereign
green bonds
in this financial year, higher than the Rs 16,000 crore in 2022-23 when it had floated such papers for the first time, said a person aware of the matter.
About half of the green bond proceeds are expected to be deployed in railways in this fiscal, followed by projects in new and renewable energy (32%), housing and urban affairs (15%),
environment and climate change
(1%) and others.
A final announcement on the exact borrowing size and calendar will be declared in September, the person told ET.
According to the expenditure plan prepared by the
finance ministry
for 2023-24, the funds raised through such bonds will be spent for financing green projects worth Rs 23,764 crore, he said.
Given that the funds raised will have to be used strictly for green projects, the spending will be kept higher than the actual borrowing. This will remove any apprehensions about the green bond proceeds not being utilised fully for the purpose for which they are being raised, the person indicated.
Live Events
As for railways, the funds will be spent in the production of energy-efficient electric locomotives, among others.
The green bonds will form a part of the central government’s overall market borrowing plan for the second half of this fiscal. The government had announced that it would borrow a total of Rs 8.88 lakh crore from the market through dated securities in the first half of 2023-24, which constituted 57.6% of the full-year target.
In 2022-23, the government issued the green bonds through two equal tranches of Rs 8,000 crore each.
A green finance working panel, headed by chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, has been mandated to select projects from the proposals submitted by various government departments.
Finance ministry officials had earlier ruled out tax concessions for the 2023-24 issuances, despite fresh demands from a section of market participants.
India’s first-ever issuance of sovereign green bonds in January drew a robust response, with orders exceeding the offer size of Rs 8,000 crore by more than four times.
It earned the bonds 5-6 basis points in “greenium”, which essentially means a favourable yield spread compared to similar issues without green credentials. Foreign investors kept away.
According to the framework already approved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the sovereign green bonds will focus on financing public projects across nine areas, including renewable energy, climate change, clean transportation, sustainable water, waste management and pollution control.

Credit bureau flags risk of retail loan boom,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/credit-bureau-flags-of-risk-of-retail-loan-boom/articleshow/101732166.cms,14-07-2023,"Credit bureaus are slowly warming up to signal risks of boom retail lending. Top officials are cautioning lenders on the sharp rise in retail loans especially unsecured retail loans that has been one of the fastest growing segments post
COVID
.
Notably unsecured consumption-led products have risen a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47% from the quarter ending March 2021 to March 2023 and credit card delinquencies rose 66 bps ( one bps is 0.01 percent) year-on-year in the March 2023 quarter to 2.94 percent.
""Responsible lending, continuous portfolio monitoring and controlling concentration risk will be essential for sustaining the growth momentum (of retail loans) "" said Rajesh Kumar MD and CEO of market major TransUnion
CIBIL
commenting on the findings of a report on retail credit trends released by his bureau. Digital and information-oriented lending is fuelling the growth of retail credit, especially unsecured loans.
“Retail credit continues to remain on a strong and steady growth trajectory. While performance across credit products is stable, some segments require close monitoring to ensure sustained and long-term growth,” Kumar added.
The report on the credit market indicator, a measure of data elements that are summarized to analyse changes in credit market health, which are categorized under four pillars: demand, supply, consumer behaviour, and performance indicates that approval rates continued to be lower compared to the same time prior year across all loan types, as lenders were cautious.

This is particularly true among new-to-credit (NTC) consumers, whom lenders typically approach with caution: approval rates for these consumers have reduced from 34% and 28% in March 2020 and 2021 respectively, to 23% in the quarter ending March 2023.
Personal loans of over Rs 50,000 comprise 98% of the total personal loan book size in terms of value. While small-ticket personal loans of less than Rs 50,000 are 2% of the personal loan book size and only account for 0.3% of the total
retail loan
book size at an industry level. "" Even though delinquencies on small-ticket personal loans have a marginal impact on the personal loan portfolio, these need to be monitored closely, especially because consumers may have other payment obligations that may be prioritized"" , the report said.

"28% GST on online gaming to yield Rs 20,000 cr annually: Revenue Secretary",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/28-gst-on-online-gaming-to-yield-rs-20000-cr-annually-revenue-secretary/articleshow/101727621.cms,13-07-2023,"The exchequer would get an estimated additional revenue of Rs 20,000 crore annually following the decision of the
GST Council
to levy 28 per cent tax on full bet value on
online gaming
, said Revenue Secretary
Sanjay Malhotra
on Thursday. The
GST
Council has unanimously decided to impose 28 per cent tax on online gaming, casino and horse racing etc, he said adding that the government will pursue all cases in the Supreme Court for recovery of erstwhile tax demands.
He said the online gaming industry is currently paying only 2-3 per cent GST which is even less than 5 per cent tax applicable on food items consumed by a common man.
""One of the members, in fact, in the GST Council pointed out that the way the online gaming companies are paying the taxes on online games at 18 per cent of GGR, which works out to only about 2-3 per cent, even lower than the tax rate of 5 per cent levied on many of the food products consumed by the very common people,"" Malhotra told PTI in an interview.
The exchequer last year (FY2022-23) collected only Rs 1,700 crore GST which could have been Rs 15,000-20,000 crore had the tax been levied on the full value.
""But this (tax by online gaming companies) is on a much lower rate which the online gaming companies are paying. Our estimate is that it should be at least about 8 to 10 times this amount. So, if that is true, it should be about Rs 15,000 to 20,000 crore annually, provided the volumes also sustain,"" he said.

Fuelling foul play and finishing fair play: How GST will distort gaming industry
These companies took refuge under the differentiation of game of skill and chance and paid 18 per cent GST on only platform fees or Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR).
The council earlier this week clarified that GST should be paid at 28 per cent on the full face value of bets.
He further said that wherever there is tax avoidance or evasion those aspects will certainly be looked into and those taxes will be recovered, he asserted.
""As you may be aware we are also going to challenge the decision of the High Court in the Supreme Court. So, our decision to collect taxes at higher rates will of course also depend on the outcome of the judgement in the Supreme Court. Unless and until we have a judgement in our favour, we will not be in a position to recover the taxes at the higher rates,"" he said.

On the possibility of review following concerns expressed by the online gaming industry, Malhotra said, ""The council was very unanimous. It has taken this decision after due deliberation. It has taken this decision after consultations with the industry. There was long consultation as you are aware that this decision has been pending for the last two to three years.""
Whether this decision will be reviewed, he said, ""The decision has just been taken. I really do not think. Of course, it is for the council to decide. I really doubt (it) because this decision has been unanimous and the decision has been taken as I mentioned after due consultation and deliberation. So, I don't think there is any chance of a review as early as this.""
On whether the high tax rate would prompt undesirable entities to operate from offshore, Malhotra said it would be a challenge but there are means available with the government.
For example, he said, ""We can have regulations on payments and introduce provisions like
TCS
.""

Aim to increase e-rupee transactions to 10 lakh per day by 2023-end: RBI DG T Rabi Sankar,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/aim-to-increase-e-rupee-transactions-to-10-lakh-per-day-by-2023-end-rbi-dg-t-rabi-sankar/articleshow/101675621.cms,12-07-2023,"MUMBAI
: The Reserve Bank of India, which is aiming for a million retail
central bank digital currency
(
CBDC
) transactions per day by the end of the current year, considers more efficient and cheaper cross-border transactions as a key aim in the development of the digital currency, deputy governor
T Rabi Sankar
said.
“The biggest advantage that we will get in CBDCs is in cross-border transactions. The current global payment system… the correspondent banking arrangement that exists has two features in my view that add inefficiencies,” Sankar said at an event organised by the Indian Banks’ Association on Tuesday.
At present, up to 10,000 such transactions are made every day. “One is the existing system — the fact that there are only these entities... means that the cost of transactions is very high. As per World Bank estimates, a cross-border small-value transaction, remittance transaction is at 6%. That’s extremely high,” he said.
Sankar pointed out that transactions through CBDCs bypass intermediaries and are instantaneous. In its aim to increase the acceptability of the CBDC, the
RBI
will take build on the existing network of the Unified Payment Interface and introduce interoperability for CBDC transactions, Sankar said.
“…There has to be an interoperability of the QR codes. Earlier what used to happen is that you would require the merchants to be onboarded, acquired by the banks and they had to have separate QR codes of CBDC,” he said. “We found that if nothing else, it takes a lot of time and especially large merchants, they had to do a lot of internal processes. So, we decided that the users of CBDC need not be disabled from the transaction because the merchant doesn’t have it,” he said. Sankar said that 13 banks had already done partial interoperability where the
UPI
QR codes could be scanned for CBDCs.

“I understand the work is apace to ensure that by the end of this month, this would be operating. In other words, when you scan it, it will go check for the CBDC account. If it’s there it will be credited,” he said.
Emphasising the fact that the CBDC is essentially money — as opposed to the UPI which is a transaction system — Sankar said that the digital currency is convertible into bank deposits.
The deputy governor said that while globally, ‘stablecoins’ — cryptocurrencies pegged to assets such as fiat currencies —were being positioned as an alternative to CBDCs, the need of the hour was to make transactions equitable.
“If it’s pegged to the (US) dollar and it’s being used in India, it’s not so good for us. Because, to the extent it replaces the use of the rupee in the economy, there is a transfer of seigniorage income from India to private issuers of these stablecoins. What happens to India’s capital regulations? What happens to India’s monetary policy if we allow stablecoins linked to some other currency? Effectively …the risk of dollarisation,” he said.

Supreme Court
on Monday rejected a plea against the
RBI
circular allowing
exchange
of 2000 rupee notes without
ID proof
, citing it as ""an area of the executive governance."" A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice P S Narasimha dismissed the appeal filed by lawyer Ashwini Updhyay.
""Allowing exchange of Rs 2000 currency notes is matter of executive policy decision,"" said the apex court.
Earlier, the high court had dismissed the plea by lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, which claimed notifications by the RBI and
SBI
enabling exchange of Rs 2,000 banknotes without proof were arbitrary and against the laws enacted to curb corruption, saying it has been done to avoid inconvenience to citizens and the court cannot sit as an appellate authority on a policy decision.
The high court has maintained it cannot be said that the government's decision is perverse or arbitrary or it encourages black money, money laundering, profiteering or abets corruption.
The Delhi High Court earlier this month had dismissed a public interest litigation (
PIL
) challenging the RBI's decision to withdraw Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes from circulation.

A bench of Chief Justice
Satish Chandra
Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad had reserved its order on the PIL on May 30 after hearing the counsels for the petitioner and the RBI.
Petitioner Rajneesh Bhaskar Gupta has contended that the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has no power to withdraw Rs 2,000 currency notes from circulation and only the Centre could have taken a decision in this regard.
In his petition, the petitioner submitted that the RBI has no independent power to direct the non-issue or discontinuance of issue of banknotes of any denominational values and this power is vested only with the Centre under section 24 (2) of the RBI Act, 1934.
Regarding the high court's May 29 judgment on a PIL which had challenged the notifications by the RBI and SBI enabling exchange of Rs 2,000 banknotes without requisition slip and identity proof, Agarwal had said that was a completely different issue.
On May 19, the RBI had announced withdrawal of Rs 2,000 currency notes from circulation, and said existing notes in circulation can either be deposited in bank accounts or exchanged by September 30.
The bank notes in Rs 2,000 denomination will continue to be a legal tender, the RBI said in a statement.
In order to ensure operational convenience and to avoid disruption of regular activities of bank branches, the RBI has said exchange of Rs 2,000 bank notes into bank notes of other denominations can be made up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time at any bank starting from May 23.

Modi’s push to take Indian rupee global gets off to a slow start,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/modis-push-to-take-indian-rupee-global-gets-off-to-a-slow-start/articleshow/101562926.cms,07-07-2023,"India
’s year-old campaign to boost the
rupee
’s role in cross-border payments has made little headway, according to people familiar with the matter, underscoring the challenges for countries trying to reduce their dependence on the dollar.
The
Reserve Bank of India
has allowed more than a dozen banks to settle trades in rupees with 18 countries since last year and is encouraging big oil exporters such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia to South Asian nations to accept the Indian currency for trade settlements.
But success has been elusive so far with total local currency trade volumes negligible at around 10 billion rupees ($120 million) since the project started, according to people familiar with the matter, who didn’t want to be named as the figures aren’t public. That compares with India’s total goods trade of $1.2 trillion in the last fiscal year.
A
Finance Ministry
spokesperson didn’t revert to an email seeking comment.
The moves to take the rupee global are closely entwined with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aspirations for a bigger global heft for India as it posts one of the world’s fastest rates of economic growth and positions itself as an alternative to
China
in manufacturing in the post-Covid era.

While India is betting on the internationalization of the rupee to reduce dollar demand and make its economy less vulnerable to global currency shocks, some of its policies run counter to those goals. Asia’s third-biggest economy still has capital controls and maintains a tight grip on the currency, while a chronic current account deficit and a smaller share of global exports — around 2% — are other impediments.
“The rupee’s prospects of becoming a significant international currency are connected to India’s economic and geopolitical strength but also the openness of its capital account and the quality of its financial markets,” said Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University and author of The Dollar Trap.
Bloomberg
The challenges became more apparent recently as India struggled to pay for a surge in cheap Russian oil imports in rupees. Moscow accounted for almost half of India’s oil imports in May, from less than 2% before the invasion of Ukraine, according to data from analytics firm Kpler.
Russia was unwilling to accept rupees due to exchange-rate volatility, preferring the yuan or
United Arab Emirates
dirham. But a lopsided trade relationship between the two countries has forced it to accumulate up to $1 billion each month in rupee assets that remain stranded outside the country.
To deal with surplus rupees, India has suggested foreign countries invest in its government bonds and bills.
But New Delhi has also been cautious in opening up its markets. Most recently, it refused to give tax exemptions for trading on international bond platforms that would have made it easier for India’s inclusion in global debt indexes. Earlier, it withdrew a plan to issue sovereign bonds in overseas markets.
“Internationalization is a process – we don’t look upon it as an event or a target that has to be reached by a particular date,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in an interview to the Central Banking magazine published last week.
China comparison
India’s efforts at pushing rupee payments for trade has drawn inevitable comparisons to China’s attempts to internationalize the yuan. The country is seen as a counterweight in the Indo-Pacific by the United States to China’s growing influence.
Its move also mirrors the backlash that is brewing against the hegemony of the US dollar. Brazil and China recently struck a deal to settle trade in their local currencies, seeking to bypass the greenback in the process. Even France is starting to complete transactions in yuan.
Bloomberg
Yet, it would be wise to note the differences, not least China’s much bigger sway in global finance. The Chinese yuan had the fifth biggest share as a global payments currency in May at 2.5% while the rupee doesn’t even fare in the top twenty, as per the latest Swift data. In terms of global forex turnover, the yuan has a 7% share versus rupee’s 1.6%, according to the latest Bank for International Settlements survey.
Still, for India, the benefits are not difficult to gauge. It mitigates currency risk for Indian businesses, reduces the need for maintaining large forex reserves as well as making it less vulnerable to external shocks.
“India is not aspiring to make the rupee a reserve currency,” Usha Thorat, former deputy governor at RBI, said in an interview to Bloomberg Television. “India is trying to make the rupee easier to be a currency of transaction and payments.”
Yet, it may be too early to write off India’s attempts to carve out a bigger role for its currency. The country is expected to be the second biggest contributor to global growth through 2028, according to the International Monetary Fund.
And an RBI report Wednesday — which didn’t represent an official view but still contained recommendations for the country’s leaders — pointed to steps they should take to push for more international use of the rupee.
“The view is that the potential share gain for the rupee as a medium of transaction is higher than as a reserve currency in the medium-term,” said Leonard Kwan, a Hong Kong-based money manager at T. Rowe Price Group Inc. “A more open capital account, with a large and liquid pool of investible assets would be one of the things to look for toward facilitating a potential eventual role as material reserve currency.”

Tomato price spike may contribute to headline inflation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/tomato-price-spike-may-contribute-to-headline-inflation/articleshow/101553118.cms,07-07-2023,"The recent rise in tomato prices across India could jeopardise the headline

forecast, according to a study by the Reserve Bank of India's development research group, which suggested better supply management to ensure price stability.
Despite making up a small portion of the

Combined (CPI-C) basket, tomato, onion, and potato are major contributors to the volatility of headline inflation, the group said.
""Given the perishable nature, limited substitutability, and increased susceptibility imparting volatility to the overall inflation,"" they stated.
RBI
had in its June policy projected CPI inflation at 5.1% in FY24 with Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 projections at 4.6%, 5.2%, 5.4% and 5.2% respectively.
Investigating how volatility transmission took place in daily prices of tomato, potato and onion for the period from January 2011 to March 2021, the study group said that fluctuation of the prices are generally due to common supply shocks which includes unseasonal rains to un-scrupulous hoarding of the commodity.

UNCTAD

India and ASEAN were the most buoyant recipients, with increases of 10 and 5%, respectively, and strong growth in project announcements, it said.
FDI inflows were higher in developing countries compared with those in developed economies. Globally, FDI declined 12% to $1.3 trillion in 2022 after a strong rebound in 2021 following the steep drop due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the report.
China, the second largest FDI host country in the world, saw a 5% increase. FDI in the Gulf region declined, but the number of project announcements increased by two thirds.
“Inflows in many smaller developing countries were stagnant, and FDI to the least developed countries (LDCs) declined,” it said.

Stressing on the need to focus on investing in sustainable energy for all as “much of the growth in international investment in renewable energy has been concentrated in developed countries”, UNCTAD called for urgent support to developing countries to bridge the gap by attracting massive investment in clean energy.
The report also shows that the investment gap across all sectors of the Sustainable Development Goals has nearly doubled since 2015.
“Developing countries need renewable energy investments of about $1.7 trillion annually but attracted foreign direct investment in clean energy worth only $544 billion in 2022,” it said.
On financing, the report called for the de-risking of energy transition investment in developing countries through loans, guarantees, insurance instruments and equity participation of both the public sector – through public private partnerships and blended finance – and multilateral development banks. It also mentioned a “new model of climate-aligned dealmaking”.
As per the report, the investment gap across all sectors of the Sustainable Development Goals has increased to more than $4 trillion per year from $2.5 trillion in 2015.
The largest gaps are in energy, water and transport infrastructure. The increase is the result of both underinvestment and additional needs.

About 44.23 million individuals opted for work under the scheme in June, up 2.3% from a year before, according to preliminary data compiled by rural development ministry. The month-on-month rise, however, was about 3.8% in June.

Steep rise in prices of cooking essentials burns a hole in pocket,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/steep-rise-in-prices-of-cooking-essentials-burns-a-hole-in-pocket/articleshow/101466815.cms,04-07-2023,"Soaring prices of tomatoes,
ginger
, chillies and cumin are putting pressure on the
kitchen bills
.
On Monday, the price of tomatoes at Delhi’s Azadpur mandi, Asia's largest wholesale market, shot up to rs 130 per kg from rs 100 on Friday. This is expected to increase the prices at the retail level to rs 170-180 a kg this week, traders said, while also warning of the prices possibly crossing the rs 200 mark.
Ginger, a basic essential for Indian cooking, costs Rs 320 per kg at the retail level compared with Rs 200 a month ago, as supplies from Karnataka have reduced due to unseasonal rains causing damage to the crop. The ongoing unrest in Manipur has also shrunk supply of ginger from the state.
Cumin or jeera, an essential spice in Indian kitchens, is hovering around Rs 55,750 per quintal at Gujarat’s
Unjha Mandi
. Jeera prices have rallied sharply on the back of strong domestic and export demand, coupled with a tight supply situation due to lower yield in the two main producer states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. A three-year low carryover stock of 50,000-60,000 tonnes has further pressurised the supply.
“Unseasonal rains in March have affected the production of jeera adversely,” said
Arvind
Patel, vice president of the Unjha mandi.

On tomatoes, Ashok Kaushik, president of the
Tomato
Traders Association at Azadpur, said the surge in prices was quite steep this time. “The same phenomenon had happened in 2017. Unseasonal rains in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan have damaged the crop,” he said.
The northern states are now depending on supplies from Himachal Pradesh, he said, adding: “Supply from Maharashtra is also less as the crop there has been affected due to erratic weather conditions.”
In eastern states, tomato production has been impacted due to a heatwave. Tomato at the retail level is now selling at Rs 150–160 per kg. Kasuhik doesn’t expect prices to soften immediately. “However, demand is reducing as consumers are not buying because of high prices. If this trend continues, then there might be a small decline in prices.” India produces around 20-21 million tonnes of tomatoes annually.

Dhruv Bhosin, owner of Delhi Ginger Trading Company, said prices of ginger at the wholesale level were going up constantly over the last two months. Rains in Karnataka have worsened the situation.
“Earlier, 25-30 trucks of ginger were coming to Azadpur mandi weekly. But now that has dwindled to 5-6 trucks. Also, farmers have cultivated a smaller crop this year as they had financially suffered last year due to higher production,” said a ginger trader from Azadpur mandi.

bank
said on Monday. It said that ₹2.72 lakh crore worth of these banknotes is back in the banking system at the end of June 30, leaving ₹84,000 crore of such notes in circulation with the public.
""According to the data received from the banks, the total value of ₹2,000 banknotes received back from circulation after the announcement on May 19 is ₹2.72 lakh crore up to June 30, 2023,"" the
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) said.
Thus, 76% of the ₹2,000 banknotes that were in circulation as on May 19 have since been returned.
On May 19, the RBI decided to withdraw the ₹2,000 denomination banknotes from circulation after observing that this denomination is not commonly used for transactions. At that time, in value terms the share of ₹2,000 denomination notes was ₹3.62 lakh crore. That was about 11% of the notes in circulation at the end of March 2023 and 2% of the banking system deposit base.
The RBI also said that data collected from major banks indicated that out of the total banknotes in ₹2,000 denomination received back from circulation, about 87% is in the form of deposits and the remaining around 13% has been exchanged into other denomination banknotes.

""Members of the public are requested to utilise the next three months to deposit and/or exchange the ₹2,000 banknotes held with them to avoid any rush in the last few days before September 30, 2023,"" the central bank said.
On June 8, central bank governor Shaktikanta Das had said that around ₹1.8 lakh crore of ₹2,000 notes had come back to the system. Of this, around 85% or ₹1.5 lakh crore had come as deposits and the rest were exchanged for other smaller denominations.

FSR
). It also said the housing sector is witnessing a healthy growth with sales growing by 21.6 per cent in the fourth quarter (January-March) of 2022-23. In addition to rising sales, new launches also maintained healthy growth, reflecting strength in demand by end-users.
The share of residential housing loans in total loans has increased over the last eleven years to 14.2 per cent in March 2023 from 8.6 per cent in March 2012, the report said.
During this period, the share of commercial real estate (CRE) in total loans has hovered between 2.0-2.9 per cent.
""Total exposure of the banking system to real estate stood at 16.5 per cent of total loans in March 2023. Given the secured nature of these loans and loan to value (LTV) ratio regulations, loan defaults remain less than 2 per cent,"" it said.

""This approach is particularly evident when it comes to home loans, as buyers seek to clear their debts promptly. Home ownership is viewed as a source of pride and accomplishment, and individuals are motivated to avoid loan defaults and the potential loss of their homes. As a result, the non-performing asset (NPA) rate in the home loan segment remains low,"" he said.
Additionally, the regulations and guidelines set by the
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) pertaining to home loans play a crucial role in maintaining this low NPA rate,"" Aggarwal added.
Executive chairman of Andromeda
Sales V Swaminathan
said the residential housing segment has experienced notable growth in demand, thanks to factors such as the implementation of
RERA
(Real Estate Regulation and Development Act), and the impact of the pandemic. Consequently, the share of home loans in the overall retail loan portfolio has increased.
""Home loans are secured loans, often involving the borrower's equity as down payment. Due to the potential risk of losing their equity in case of default, borrowers generally prioritize early repayment of their home loans. As a result, the non-performing asset (NPA) rate in the home loan segment remains low,"" he added.
According to an RBI data, housing (including priority sector housing) loan outstanding in March 2023 was Rs 19,36,428 crore, up 15 per cent year-on-year. The FSR further said the all-India house price index (HPI) recorded its highest increase over the last seventeen quarters (4.6 per cent y-o-y) in the fourth quarter of 2022-23.
On a sequential (q-o-q) basis, HPI has been rising over the last one year and inched up further by 0.6 per cent during January-March.
It also said that during the fourth quarter of 2022-23, house sales grew by 21.6 per cent and new launches also maintained healthy growth, reflecting strength in demand by end-users as well as investors.
The rise in unsold inventory resulted in an uptick in the inventory overhang in January-March of 2022-23, it said.
It noted that with strong demand for houses in the post-pandemic period, the house price gap (actual less trend) is closing after a period of around three years. A positive house price gap is an early warning of concentration of credit and vulnerability in the housing market.
As per the RBI's 'Basic Statistical Return on Credit by Scheduled Commercial Banks in India - March 2023', the share of loans bearing over 9 per cent interest rate rose to 56.1 per cent in March 2023, in tandem with the monetary tightening measures starting May 2022.
The Reserve Bank started raising interest in May 2022 to rein in inflation in the wake of global supply disruptions, following the Russia-Ukraine war. Since then the benchmark short-term lending rate has increased by 250 basis points. However, the RBI did not raise the rate in its last two bi-monthly monetary policy reviews.

Nirmala Sitharaman
on Saturday said
Goods and Services Tax
(
GST
) has helped bring down the taxes for consumers by removing the cascading effect of 'tax-on-tax' and added to the revenue buoyancy of states.
She said the GST system has seen massive scaling up since its implementation on July 1, 2017, and the benefit accrued to consumers and governments because of GST implementation is an ""exemplar"".
""GST has brought in greater tax buoyancy as a result of which, more than your GSDP growth, your tax collection is growing. Therefore, both Centre and states benefit...We have to dispel this myth that states are losing out after having joined hands for GST...Today, no state suffers after GST, and that is despite Covid,""
Sitharaman
said.
Giving a comparison of tax rates pre and
post-GST
, Sitharaman said, ""GST has done justice to the consumers by bringing the rates down compared to the previous regime"".
Before GST was introduced,
India
's indirect tax system was fragmented, where every state was effectively a distinct market for the industry as well as the consumer.

The multiplicity of taxes in the pre-GST regime resulted in a ""tax-on-tax"" effect, causing the same product to be taxed multiple times and hence becoming costlier for the consumers, she said at the GST Day 2023.
""The introduction of GST has brought the actual tax on consumers down and in some cases, remarkably down. Despite this reality, you still have a lot of people confusing the minds of people saying 'GST has burdened the society'. Actually not,"" Sitharaman noted.
GST has also made sure that only that much tax, which is genuinely due to the government, is being collected systematically without any personal level of discretion, she said, adding GST has made life easy for small businesses and easy for goods to move freely in the country.
""Whether it is common consumer, whether it is the state government, a matter of tax buoyancy, whether it is making it digital and simpler, GST stands out as an exemplar,"" Sitharaman said.
Giving data, Sitharaman said the revenue buoyancy of states improved from 0.72 in the pre-GST era, to 1.22 post-GST rollout.
Before GST, the state's tax revenue growth was 8.3 per cent while GDP growth was 11.5 per cent, which means a low tax buoyancy of 0.72. This means that states' tax revenues were growing slower than the GDP.
After GST, tax growth was 12.3 per cent, while GDP growth was 9.8 per cent, resulting in a higher buoyancy of 1.22.
Post-GST revenue buoyancy of states is much higher than pre-GST buoyancy, Sitharaman said.
""Now the quick recovery, the new normal (in the collection) all prove that states have not lost out, and on the contrary, their tax buoyancy has gone up post GST"".
The minister said GST means double tax being avoided and relief to the common man in terms of tax rates coming down.
It is ""completely fair to the common man"", she said.
The minister complimented tax officers for their ""dedication and commitment and grit"", which helped in making monthly GST revenues of Rs 1.60 lakh crore a ""new normal"". GST collection in June grew 12 per cent to over Rs 1.61 lakh crore.

's
external debt
rose marginally to USD 624.7 billion annually at end-March 2023, although the debt-GDP ratio declined, as per a
Reserve Bank
data released on Friday. The external
debt
rose by USD 5.6 billion from USD 619.1 billion at end-March 2022.
""The external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.9 per cent at end-March 2023 from 20 per cent at end-March 2022,"" said the Reserve Bank's data on India's External Debt as at end-March 2023.
Valuation gains due to the appreciation of the US dollar compared to the Indian rupee and major currencies such as yen,
SDR
, and euro were placed at USD 20.6 billion.
""Excluding the valuation effect, external debt would have increased by USD 26.2 billion instead of USD 5.6 billion at end-March 2023 over end-March 2022,"" the central bank added.
At end-March 2023, as per the data, long-term debt (with original maturity of above one year) was placed at USD 496.3 billion, recording a decline of USD 1.1 billion over its level at end-March 2022.

The share of short-term debt (with original maturity of up to one year) in total external debt increased to 20.6 per cent at end-March 2023 from 19.7 per cent at end-March 2022.
Similarly, the ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to
foreign exchange reserves
increased to 22.2 per cent at end-March 2023 (20 per cent at end-March 2022).
RBI
also said US dollar-denominated debt remained the largest component of India's external debt, with a share of 54.6 per cent at end-March 2023, followed by debt denominated in the Indian rupee (29.8 per cent), SDR (6.1 per cent), yen (5.7 per cent), and the euro (3.2 per cent).
Loans remained the largest component of external debt, with a share of 32.5 per cent, followed by currency and deposits (22.6 per cent), trade credit and advances (19.9 per cent) and debt securities.
As per the central bank, debt service (principal repayments and interest payments) increased marginally to 5.3 per cent of current receipts at end-March 2023 as compared with 5.2 per cent at end-March 2022, reflecting higher debt service.

"RBI upgrades info management system, launches next generation data warehouse CIMS",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-upgrades-info-management-system-launches-next-generation-data-warehouse-cims/articleshow/101394213.cms,30-06-2023,"KOLKATA: The regulatory supervision, monitoring and enforcement will get a leg up as the
Reserve Bank of India
has upgraded its information management framework with the introduction of the
Centralised Information Management System
(
CIMS
), a next generation data warehouse.
Monetary policymaking will be more robust too with refined economic analysis as the new system can manage big data flow with aggregation, analysis, public dissemination and data governance, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta said, after unveiling the system at its Statistics Day conference on Friday.
This new system will also reduce regulatory compliance burden for regulated entities as reporting of data will become easier.
""In the short to medium term, it would lead to a paradigm shift in the Reserve Bank’s economic analysis as well as supervision, monitoring and enforcement across multiple domains,"" Das said in his inaugural address at the 17th Statistics Day Conference, to mark the birth anniversary of Prof Prasanta Chandra Mahalanabis, who was instrumental in institutionalising statistics in India.
Mahalanabis was born on June 29, 1893.

Das elaborated that the new system would use state-of-the-art technology to manage Big data and serve as a platform for power users to carry out data mining, text mining, visual analytics and advanced statistical analysis connecting data from multiple domains, such as, financial, external, fiscal, corporate and real sectors as well as prices.
Of late, macroeconomic policy making and monitoring processes have become more data intensive.
However, certain core macroeconomic aggregates - such as, gross domestic product (GDP) growth and price inflation, where compilation process is dependent on multiple channels - are available with a time lag globally.
""Their early estimates, which are indeed very useful, are compiled with limited set of inputs and partial data and are prone to multiple and sometimes significant revisions. Policymakers who use them as inputs, however, do not have the luxury of revising decisions in retrospect,"" the governor said.
Monetary policymakers supplement official estimates with information on auxiliary variables to have firmer assessment and minimise policy errors emanating from data revision. Statistical information is also used by businesses and households in making assessment of the economic situation and firming up their near-term expectations, Das said.
The new system is starting with reporting by scheduled commercial banks and will be gradually extended to urban cooperative banks (UCBs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).

10% retail borrowers missing their monthly payments: RBI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/10-retail-borrowers-missing-their-monthly-payments-rbi/articleshow/101374581.cms,29-06-2023,"India's bad loans may be at a decadal low, but nearly 10% of
retail borrowers
are missing monthly payments, the Reserve Bank of India has flagged in its latest financial stability report. These borrowers manage to keep their accounts from slipping into non-performing assets (NPAs) with some
payments
before the 90-day deadline.
Moreover, an inflation print higher than the mandated band of 2-6% puts household debt portfolio of many retail borrowers at risk, the central bank said.
It, however, assured that these signs of potential stress in retail loans do not pose an imminent risk to systemic stability of the banking sector.
""Although the gross non-performing ratio of retail loans at the system level was low at 1.4% as of March 2023, the share of 'special mention accounts' was relatively high at 7.4% for scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) and it accounted for a tenth of their retail assets portfolio,""
RBI
's latest financial stability report said.
Stress in a loan account is identified by creating three sub-categories under the special mention account (SMA) category. An account is categories as, SMA-0 if the principal or interest payment is delayed but not overdue for more than 30 days, SMA-1 if the principal or interest payment is overdue between 31 and 60 days, and SMA-3 if the principal or interest payment is overdue between 61 and 90 days. If a loan account is overdue for 90 days or more, then it is classified as NPA.

The central bank's observation assumes significance because of the runaway growth in retail loans portfolio of commercial banks in the country, accounting for the largest share as category at 32% of total bank loans as of March 2023, up from 25% five years ago in March 2018.
Retail loans grew at a compounded annual rate of 24.8% between March 2021 and March 2023, almost double the pace of gross advances that grew 13.8% a year during the same period.
Another concern is that growth of unsecured loans has outpaced that of secured loans.
A sensitivity analysis by the central bank's researchers showed that there is a likelihood of a 9 percentage points increase in the number of loans at risk and a 8 percentage points rise in debt at risk under various scenarios of inflation exceeding the mandated band of 2-6%.
Besides the central bank researchers' analysis also points to potential stress on household balance sheets. ""
Households
with EMI-to-income ratio of more than 60% are more at risk of a negative financial margin,"" the report said. A household's financial margin is defined as income net of estimated taxes,
EMI
(equated monthly instalment) on housing loan, and expenditure on basic necessities.
Inflation has been on an upward trend since December 2018, peaking at 7.3% in the June 2022 quarter. Although inflation has been easing of late, it still remains above the 4% target and is projected to be over 5% in 2023-24.
High inflation increases the expenditure on basic necessities, and the ensuing tightening monetary policy cycle increases the EMI, producing a significant impact on the financial margins of households.

RBI in talks with leading global peers to promote digital rupee payments,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-in-talks-with-leading-global-peers-to-promote-digital-rupee-payments/articleshow/101288604.cms,27-06-2023,"Kolkata:
The Reserve Bank of India (
RBI
) is in talks with other major global central banks to promote
digital rupee
for cross-border payments, Governor Shaktikanta Das said, while the central bank allowed trade payments in rupees last year to enhance the local unit’s acceptability globally.
""CBDC (central bank digital currency) is going to be the future of money. We are preparing ourselves for that. By the end of this month, we hope to reach about one million users of retail CBDC. That is for domestic payments. But cross-border payments will also become much quicker, more seamless and very cost-effective. That is another area where a lot of attention needs to be given. We are constantly in dialogue with other central banks that have introduced or are introducing CBDCs,"" he said in an interview after being honoured as ""Governor of the Year"" at London's Central Banking Awards.
Barely months before unveiling the CBDC pilot in both retail and wholesale segments, the central bank allowed
rupee
settlement for international trade as a step towards internationalisation of the rupee.
Banks from 18 countries have opened rupee vostro accounts since July last year, helping their importers settle payments in the rupee.
""In India, we have no shortage of dollars, but in some other markets, due to a shortage of dollars, they are unable to do imports. So, in a sense, it is a facility we are giving, so countries can continue to import from India and settle in rupees. It also de-risks importers and exporters from both sides, from the volatility of international currencies,"" Das said during the interview with Christopher Jeffery, Central Banking's editor in chief, and Daniel Hinge.
Live Events
The central bank shared the copy of the interview Monday with the local media. Das responded to a host of queries ranging from RBI's foreign exchange strategy to India's inflation dynamics and Indian banking.
He shared his thoughts behind the strategy to stack up foreign exchange reserves when the dollar inflows were strong.
""In the ‘taper tantrum’ period, suddenly, India had an external sector crisis, and the RBI had to attract foreign inflows by offering some incentives. We did not want to have a repeat of that situation. For that, we needed to build reserves, which must be strong. So, as a conscious policy, when the inflows were good, we started to build our reserves,"" said Das, who has been at the helm of the central bank of the world's fifth largest economy since December 2018.
India's foreign exchange reserves peaked in September 2021 to about $642 billion, which has provided RBI the elbowroom to intervene in the market when overseas investors started withdrawing dollars from the emerging markets following Russia's attack on Ukraine last year. RBI's intervention helped the rupee to be one of the least volatile currencies last year despite intense pressure.
Das, who served more than four decades as an Indian Administrative Service officer prior to his current role, said India can achieve optimum growth if inflation can be reduced to 4% level and there is no immediate need to change the inflation goalpost.
“We recommended that 4% was the desirable target, because our analysis shows 4% is the level at which there will be optimum growth... I feel existing targets are quite robust, they are built over a period of time. And because of the experience of the last two or three years, with many black swan events, one should not in a hurry shift the goalposts,” Das said.
On the banking sector, he said that Indian banks are more agile and alert than ever before in recognising risks and addressing them on time. “We have really strengthened. As a result, the Indian banking sector today is very stable and healthy,” he said, referring to the critical parameters in terms of capital adequacy, liquidity and percentage of stressed assets.
He said that banks now with strong capital buffers are ready to handle severe stress as shown in the stress tests after the failure of banks in the US and Credit Suisse in Europe. Asked about the relationship between the central bank and government, Das spoke about interdependence between the two authorities and the need for a relationship based on a constant dialogue.

Only four states --
Karnataka
, Sikkim, Arunachal and
Bihar
-- have over-achieved their targets, while Jharkhand and
Madhya Pradesh
's capex spending stood at 98 per cent each. Eleven states fared better with 80 per cent target achievements, as per the analysis by
Bank of Baroda
economists.
As against this, in FY21, the underachievement level was a high 72 per cent, primarily due to the pandemic emergency spending, and had improved to 95 per cent in FY22.
Surprisingly, none of the 25 states whose data are available has been able to achieve the target by even three-fourths as the peak success rate is only 72.4 per cent, according to the analysis.
This is surprising as the Centre had disbursed the required amounts for the year.
The poor show was led by Andhra, which could spend only 23.1 per cent or Rs 6,917 crore of the Rs 29,917 crore budgeted for the past fiscal; followed by Haryana, which spent only 48.1 per cent or Rs 10,604 crore of the Rs 22,047 crore, and Rajasthan managed to cross the halfway mark (50.2 per cent) or 19,650 crore of the Rs 39,148 crore. Tripura could spend only 41.3 per cent or Rs 2,185 crore of the Rs budgeted Rs 5,285 crore, and Nagaland spent 47.7 per cent or Rs 7,936 crore of the Rs 16,650 crore, the analysis showed.

On the other hand, Maharashtra leads the pack with a 72.4 per cent target achievement, with Rs 60,499 crore being put to use from the Rs 83,530 crore budgeted for FY23.
Surprisingly, Kerala, which is a traditional laggard, comes to the second slot, achieving 69.4 per cent of the budgeted capex of Rs 19,330 crore, spending Rs 13,407 crore; and Uttar Pradesh comes third with 69 per cent or Rs 93,555 crore of the Rs 1,35,677 crore.
Uttarakhand is a close fourth with 68.4 per cent of the Rs 11,987 crore; Meghalaya at the fifth slot (67.8 per cent of the Rs 3,233 crore), Bengal next with 67.6 per cent of the Rs 33,144 crore; Assam (64.5 per cent of the Rs 24,064 crore); Punjab (61.1 per cent of the 10,930 crore); Telangana (59.6 per cent of the Rs 29,064 crore).
Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh alone, with Rs 2.19 lakh crore budgeted capex, contribute 29.2 per cent of the total but fared poorly, thus bringing down the all-states average to 70 per cent or thereabout, according to the analysis.
On the contrary, according to the report, the Centre has met its targets in terms of actual capex in various areas and loan disbursals to the states.
Punjab and Andhra -- the two states that top the freebies list -- also exceeded their deficits too.
Normally, states tend to wait for the fourth quarter to push projects and investments to assess their fiscal balances and therefore, fail to identify enough projects in such a short period, leading to target missing.

Why has India’s corporate tax mop-up failed to match the pace of personal income-tax collection?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/why-has-indias-corporate-tax-mop-up-failed-to-match-the-pace-of-personal-income-tax-collection/articleshow/101245568.cms,24-06-2023,"Back in 2010-11, India’s
corporate tax
mop-up was twice its
personal income tax
(PIT) collection. Now both are almost equal. In the past decade, the nation’s
direct tax
story has shown a trend: while the growth of companies’ tax payouts has been modest, citizens are contributing much more to the exchequer than what they used to.
Look at 2022-23. In terms of tax buoyancy, which is an indicator of the responsiveness of tax growth to the pace of the economy, PIT fared way better than corporate income tax (CIT). If we look at the net CIT collection in the last fiscal year (Rs 825,834 crore in total), the buoyancy was just 1, whereas in the case of PIT (Rs 808,221 crore) the buoyancy was 1.2.
Tax buoyancy
of 1 means the pace of tax collection is equal to the growth of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). More than 1 means tax mop-up is growing faster than the economy, while anything less than 1 indicates a slower growth of tax collection as compared with the economic growth.
As far as corporate tax buoyancy in the past one decade is concerned, it has repeatedly slipped below 1 — for instance, in six consecutive years from FY12 to FY17. It moved upward in the following two years only to fall again in 2019-20, this time in the negative territory (-2.5). “In FY20, the dip in CIT buoyancy could be due to the combined impact of the economic slowdown and the CIT rate cut,” says an analysis by Ernst & Young (EY). The analysis looks at net collection, meaning tax after refund.
PIT buoyancy, too, has occasionally slipped below the threshold, for instance in FY15 and FY16, but it was above 1 in multiple years, including in the last two years, indicating robust collection of tax from individuals.

Indian economy is humming along even with still-high rates
THE REASONS
Why has India’s corporate tax mop-up failed to match the pace of personal income tax collection? Should the corporate tax’s share in GDP, at 3% in FY23, be considered satisfactory when it had achieved much higher in earlier years (in the range of 3.2-3.9% during FY11-FY19)?
Tax experts and income tax analysts whom ET spoke to are unanimous that CIT collection looks slow and stagnant because PIT mop-up has been extraordinary due to multiple reasons, including efficacy of digital tools, better compliance and steep rise in wages in select services sectors. They also say that the corporate tax rate, which was lowered from 30% to 25% in 2019, and the 15% concession offered to new manufacturing companies must not be tweaked in the near future, as it will be construed as India’s tax policy instability. Also, they argue, the corporate tax mop-up is still satisfactory and has not slipped into the red zone.
Vikas Vasal, tax partner of Grant Thornton Bharat, lists a number of reasons behind the high PIT collection even after the Covid-19 outbreak. “The rise in wages across sectors, especially the high-paying services sector , increased formalisation of the economy and more job creation in the organised sector post-Covid have all contributed to high personal tax collections,” he says.

compliance on salaries through increased awareness and enforcement and the new, simplified tax regime.
Another tax expert, Sudhir Kapadia, argues that the compliance level in CIT was always high. “But due to some transformative measures on tax digitisation undertaken by the government, the compliance level in PIT too has improved significantly,” says Kapadia, partner, tax and regulatory services, EY. He adds that the current CIT buoyancy is satisfactory.
WHAT NEXT?
Will the present trend of CIT and PIT growth continue in the near term or will the graphs behave differently? Rohinton Sidhwa of Deloitte India says, “CIT growth will continue at 14-15%. PIT should show better gains simply due to better compliance and more taxpayers.”
At present, the lion’s share of CIT comes from a handful of big conglomerates. According to the ETIG database, among 4,600 listed companies, 22 contributed 50% of tax in FY23. During the year, top 10 taxpaying companies, in descending order, were Reliance Industries, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, ICICI Bank, Power Finance Corporation, Bajaj Finserv, Coal India, Vedanta and Tata Steel. In FY22, a year hit by the deadly second wave of the pandemic, 21 companies paid tax of Rs 5,000 crore and above, constituting 46.5% of the total tax paid by listed entities.

Till June 17 of the current fiscal year, for which data is available, the gross collection of direct taxes (before adjusting for refunds) registered a growth of 12.7% over the corresponding period last year. The gross corporate tax collected during the period — Rs 187,311 crore — shrank by 1.7% over the same period last year. Direct tax kitty includes collection of CIT, PIT and securities transaction tax (STT) whereas indirect tax largely covers goods and services tax (GST).
The Q1 growth in advance tax, at 13.7%, is an early indicator of what appears to be continued growth in the current fiscal year, says Sidhwa of Deloitte. Quoting a recent report of the parliamentary standing committee on finance, EY’s Kapadia says TDS, tax collection at source (TCS) and advance tax comprise 90% of tax revenues. “With the growing speed and scale of digitisation in tax administration along with the use of intelligent data analytics by the tax department, it is expected that both PIT and CIT revenues will continue to grow at a healthy pace,” he says.

R Prasad, former chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), says the government reduced the corporate tax in 2019 mainly to have tax parity with some of India’s competitors in Southeast Asia, for example, Vietnam and Indonesia, and with the expectation that the extra cash would be deployed in new ventures, which in turn will create more jobs .
“Unfortunately, private investment has remained tepid after the pandemic even though corporate tax rates were slashed in 2019. On the PIT front, the salaried class continues to be the most taxed category,” he adds.
The 15% corporate tax slab for newly incorporated manufacturing companies is one of the lowest in the world.
For Vikram Doshi, a partner in Price Waterhouse & Co, this is a statement by the government that it is serious in wooing investments to the manufacturing sector. It’s unlikely that the government will change corporate tax rates in the near future.
""Unfortunately private investment has remained tepid after the pandemic even though corporate tax rates were slashed in 2019. On the PIT front, the salaried class continues to be the most taxed category""
— R PRASAD, Former chairman, CBDT
However, voices demanding more tax from highly profit-making companies will only get louder if the biggies hold back their expansion plans and hold on to the cash in hand. The policy was criticised in the peak of the pandemic when tax collection had nosedived. The issue surfaces whenever there are reports on tepid private investments despite the conglomerates’ healthy balance sheets. The government has, however, made it amply clear that the corporate tax policy, for now, will continue as it is.
In this scenario, what could be the outlook for tax collection in the coming years?
Grant Thornton’s Vasal makes three points. One, with rising GDP, tax collections are bound to increase in a similar proportion. Two, with increased formalisation of the economy, total tax collections will grow rapidly. Three, the number of measures taken by the government to collate information and the use of data analytics to identify red flags are all yielding results and will help improve the tax to GDP ratio in the coming years.

"Withdrawal of Rs 2,000 note can boost growth by pushing consumption: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/withdrawal-of-rs-2000-note-can-boost-growth-by-pushing-consumption-report/articleshow/101116013.cms,19-06-2023,"The ₹2,000 note withdrawal decision and response to it so far suggest that the move can help boost FY24
GDP growth
to beyond 6.5% estimated by the
RBI

Reserve Bank of India
's 6.5% estimate can also be exceeded, economists at the country's largest lender
SBI
said.
""We expect Q1 FY24 GDP growth at 8.1% with an upward bias due to the impact of ₹2,000 note withdrawal event...this reinforces our projection that FY24 GDP could be higher than 6.5%, basis the RBI estimate,"" a note said.
It can be noted that earlier this month, the RBI informed that over half of the currency notes in the denomination have returned back, with 85% of it coming as deposits into banks, while the remaining 15% have been exchanged at bank counters.
Based on this experience, the SBI note said the consumption can get a ₹55,000 crore boost because of the move.
It estimated ₹3.08 lakh crore to come back as deposits into the system, of which ₹92,000 crore will come into saving banks accounts, of which 60% will get withdrawn, thus giving an immediate increase in consumption at ₹55,000 crore. In the long run, the boost can be ₹1.83 lakh crore because of the consumption multiplier, it added.

Reserve Bank
of India (
RBI
) has refuted recent reports regarding missing
banknotes
printed by banknote printing presses.
The RBI clarified that these reports were inaccurate and based on a misinterpretation of information obtained through the Right to Information Act, 2005.
Officials from the RBI emphasized that all banknotes supplied from the printing presses to the RBI are duly accounted for.
""These reports are based on an erroneous interpretation of information collected under the Right to Information Act, 2005 from the printing press,"" officials said.
Robust systems have been put in place to ensure the reconciliation of banknotes printed at the presses and supplied to the RBI. These systems include protocols to monitor the production, storage, and distribution of banknotes.
Live Events
The RBI urges the public to rely on information published by the RBI itself on such matters. They assure the public that accurate information will be provided from time to time.
RBI had previously announced the withdrawal of the Rs 2,000 denomination
currency
notes from circulation, while still maintaining their legal tender status. Banks have been advised to discontinue issuing Rs 2,000 banknotes with immediate effect.
Individuals can exchange or deposit their Rs 2,000 notes at bank branches and regional branches of the RBI. Non-account holders can also exchange Rs 2,000 banknotes up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at any bank branch.
The RBI has set September 30 as the deadline for completing the exchange exercise, allowing adequate time for the public to make the necessary transactions. However, the RBI may review the September deadline based on the prevailing situation.
Introduced in November 2016 to meet the immediate currency requirements after the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes, the Rs 2,000 denomination banknote was phased out as banknotes in other denominations became more readily available. Printing of the Rs 2,000 banknotes ceased in the financial year 2018-19.
As of March 31, 2023, the total value of Rs 2,000 banknotes in circulation had declined significantly, accounting for only 10.8% of the total Notes in Circulation. It was also observed that this particular denomination is not commonly used for everyday transactions.

. “ The actual decline is lower, which indicates that part of the deposited notes would have been simultaneously withdrawn also”.
The central bank, on May 21 earlier this year decided to withdraw the ₹2000 denomination banknotes from circulation; it was observed that it is not used regularly for transactions. Besides, the stock of banknotes in other denominations continues to be adequate to meet the currency requirement of the public.

The central bank’s move has also added to the surplus liquidity in the system which is estimated at close to Rs one lakh crore, according to market analysts. “From a liquidity standpoint, the substantial increase in liquidity in June was driven firstly by a pickup in government expenditure , followed by the impact of the 2000 note withdrawal” said Sengupta.
The ₹2000 denomination banknote was introduced in November 2016 under Section 24(1) of
RBI Act
, 1934 to meet the currency requirements of the economy in an expeditious manner after the withdrawal of legal tender status of all ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes in circulation at that time.

Delayed monsoon can impact inflation; expect FY24 CPI at 5.2 per cent: Deutsche Bank,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/delayed-monsoon-can-impact-inflation-expect-fy24-cpi-at-5-2-per-cent-deutsche-bank/articleshow/101049080.cms,16-06-2023,"A German brokerage on Friday warned that with the delayed monsoon, there is no scope for complacency on inflation even though official data for May has shown a cool-off.
Deutsche Bank
said it expects the average
Consumer Price Inflation
(CPI) for FY24 to come to 5.2 per cent against the 5.1 per cent estimate of the
Reserve Bank of India
and the consensus 5 per cent for analysts.
""...with monsoon rains currently being 53 per cent below normal and given the history of food prices tending to shoot up in July following a poor start to monsoon, it is amply clear there is no scope for complacency at this stage as far as India's inflation risks are concerned,"" the brokerage said.
The possibility of a 5 per cent or lower headline inflation can only play out if we are lucky and food prices do not rise in July and August, it added.
July will be a key month as poor monsoon could drive a potentially sharp spike in July
food price inflation
, it said, adding that in the last two episodes of lower rainfall in 2009 and 2014, there were spikes in the month.
The rainfall is 53 per cent below the normal so far and the arrival of the southwest monsoon has been delayed across the country, leading to late sowing of the summer crop.
Live Events
Amid reports of tomatoes getting dearer, the brokerage said that the prices of key vegetables, such as onions, potatoes, and tomatoes, could also rise sharply in the coming months.
""Given that there is a non-trivial threat of
El Nino
occurring in 2023, the delayed start to monsoon rains in India is worrying, particularly for the inflation trajectory going forward,"" it said.
The weaker monsoon can also have an impact on the GDP growth front, the brokerage said, adding that the headline real GDP growth can fall by up to 0.30 per cent if the monsoon disappoints and agriculture sector growth turns out to be around 1 per cent as seen in the drought years of 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2015.

“A sharper fall in input price pressures relative to output prices led to a decline in the index value to 1.01.”
An increasing ratio indicates input costs rising faster than output, leading to higher pass-through by companies to protect margins.
Crisil economists point out that the fall in input costs may have positive implications for core inflation, which has proved stickier.
“Core inflation in goods, particularly, may see more downside than upside, given easing costs of production and expected growth moderation in the current fiscal,” the note stated.
Data released by the government earlier this week showed that consumer inflation eased to a 25-month low of 4.25% in May, closer to the
Reserve Bank of India
’s target rate of 4%. Core inflation had remained flat at 5.15% in May.
On the other hand, wholesale prices dipped to a 90-month low of -3.48% in May.
The Crisil report points out that sluggish demand and lower global energy and commodity prices are expected to contain price pressures. Moreover, an easing of global supply chains is expected to help further.
“Advanced economies have weaker demand for inputs as their growth slows. An uneven recovery in
China
this year, after initial exuberance post lifting of restrictions, has further contributed,” the report noted.
However, downside risks persist.
""Sudden shocks from ongoing geopolitical tensions cannot be ruled out, or accounted for, at this moment,"" Crisil said.
A fall in inflation to 4% for a sustained period is expected to raise expectations of a rate cut. The Reserve Bank of India held the policy rate at 6.5% for the second consecutive time at its June meeting.
Multilateral organisations, like the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, are pencilling a rate cut in mid-2024.

The AUM corpus is mark-to-market, so the adverse moment in the market impacts the corpus.
Out of Rs 9.58 lakh crore, he said, NPS alone has a fund size of Rs 9.29 lakh crore while the remaining Rs 28,538 crore is the corpus of APY.

In terms of numbers, Mohanty said subscribers under NPS have already crossed 10 lakh last year.
This year, he said, ""We expect the number of subscribers to touch 13 lakh as this space is growing. We hope to achieve this number"".
NPS comprises contributions from government employees and the other part is the private sector, he said, adding the government sector is on autopilot because they keep coming on their own, but there is a need to grow on the private side.
For this, Mohanty said, the regulator is taking a lot of initiatives, for example, PFRDA has allowed even the agents to underwrite NPS and trade bodies are being sensitised to promote NPS among corporates.
""On the digital side, we have taken a lot of initiatives for example, e-NPS, where one can do it on their own rather than through an intermediary,"" he said.
With regard to APY, the regulator said penetration and expansion have been quite satisfactory.
""Last year, we crossed a landmark of more than one crore subscribers -- to be exact 1.2 crore. And this year (2023-24), we are targeting about 1.3 crore,"" he said.
So, as of now, the APY subscription base is almost 5.2 crore, which is quite substantial, Mohanty added.
""But having said that potential is there. If you look at the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), which has 49 crore accounts. Of this, about 25 crore account holders are in the age group of 18 to 40. That is the potential segment that we need to tap and thus a long way to go...we are to see how we manage the whole process in a more systematic and manageable way,"" he noted.

"India's debt burden likely to decline, key determinant of fiscal strength will be affordability: Moody's",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-debt-burden-likely-to-decline-key-determinant-of-fiscal-strength-will-be-affordability-moodys/articleshow/101021344.cms,15-06-2023,"Moody's
Investors Service on Thursday said the key determinant of India's fiscal strength and the credit profile will be debt affordability and projected a downward trend for the debt burden. ""As long as nominal GDP growth holds, India's debt burden will be stable or decline slightly,"" Moody's said.
In a report, it said India's fast-growing GDP, which is estimated to average 11 per cent in nominal terms, is a key driver of the projections of a downward trend in the country's debt burden.
""As in the past, the key determinant of fiscal strength and the credit profile will be debt affordability and in particular the proportion of revenue absorbed by interest payments,"" Moody's said.
India has a relatively high level of general government debt, estimated at around 81.8 per cent of GDP for 2022-23, compared with the Baa-rated median of around 56 per cent.
The country also has a low debt affordability, in terms of general government interest payments as a percentage of revenues, which for India is estimated at 26 per cent for 2022-23, compared with the Baa median of around 8.4 per cent.

""At 26 per cent currently, it is a large proportion, which, if not further addressed via a continued broadening of the revenue base, will remain an important constraint on the government's ability to provide more support for growth and address developmental needs,"" Moody's added.
Moody's has a 'Baa3' sovereign credit rating on India, with stable outlook. Baa3 is the lowest investment grade rating.
On Friday, Moody's is scheduled to meet Indian government officials during which the latter is likely to make a strong pitch for a sovereign rating upgrade.

Aggregate state GST collections growth to moderate to 12-14 per cent in FY24: Crisil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/aggregate-state-gst-collections-growth-to-moderate-to-12-14-per-cent-in-fy24-crisil/articleshow/100996860.cms,14-06-2023,"The growth in aggregate
GST
collection for states is likely to moderate to 12-14 per cent in FY24 from 20 per cent in FY23, domestic rating agency
Crisil
said on Wednesday. However, despite the moderation in growth, the
GST collections
will continue to be the biggest driver of
revenue growth for states
, the agency's senior director
Anuj Sethi
said.
""...growth in aggregate state GST collection will moderate from 20 per cent on-year last fiscal to 12-14 per cent this fiscal,"" he added.
Factors like the resilience of the Indian economy amid global turbulence, moderating inflationary environment, and increasing tax compliance will help the GST collections, Sethi said.
The rating agency said 18 states that account for 90 per cent of aggregate gross state domestic product may see steady revenue growth at 6-8 per cent to a cumulative Rs 34 lakh crore this fiscal against a 7.3 per cent growth in FY23.
With the withdrawal of GST compensation support and muted sales tax collections and grants, growth this year will be predominantly supported by Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections, devolutions from the Centre and taxes and duties on liquor sales, together comprising 55-60 per cent of aggregate state revenues, it noted.

Growth in the central tax devolutions pool will moderate to 10 per cent from 13 per cent in the last fiscal, the agency said, adding that this will be among the main driver of revenues for states.
""While the proportion (of central tax devolution) is determined by the Finance Commission, the overall kitty is linked with gross tax collections by the Centre,"" it said.
Excise duty and sales tax from liquor sales will also grow healthy at 10-12 per cent, led by increasing consumption as most states have kept their tax structure unchanged, it said.
States' revenue from sales tax on motor fuel may increase only by a modest 6-8 per cent driven primarily by steady demand for petroleum products, with only a handful of states having announced revisions in their tax structures for motor fuel in their budgets for FY24, it said.
""Among the other main reasons for the modest revenue growth overall, would be the marginal growth in grants from the Centre. This includes grants towards Centrally Sponsored Schemes and Finance Commission grants, including those towards post-devolution revenue deficits, based on the budget calculations and Finance Commission stipulations,"" its director Aditya Jhaver said.
Jhaver reminded that GST compensation grants from the central government at Rs 90,000 crore last fiscal are no longer available this fiscal as the scheme ended effective June 30, 2022.
The agency also said a volatile global economic outlook and its impact on export-linked sectors could negatively impact the revenue projections, while better-than-expected tax buoyancy, any extension in the GST compensation period, or support from the Centre in the form of higher grants could augment states' collections.

"GST evasion of Rs 30,000 crore unearthed",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-evasion-of-30000-crore-unearthed/articleshow/100973955.cms,15-06-2023,"A nationwide crackdown by the
Goods and Services Tax
authorities uncovered tax evasion to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore, allegedly carried out via stolen identities including as many as 18,000 Permanent Account Number (PAN) and Aadhaar cards, people familiar with the development said.
The identities of beneficiaries of PM Kisan and other social security schemes were allegedly used to operate 4,000 shell companies and 16,000 fake
GST
registrations.
The GST authorities launched the two-month anti-evasion exercise on May 16 and about 10,000 fake registrations were detected in the first week.
The GST authorities have roped in other agencies including the Income Tax department, Enforcement Directorate and the ministry of corporate affairs, which are initiating separate actions against the individuals and firms involved in view of the organised nature evasion spread across 16 states.
Tax authorities have carried out searches at multiple locations and have arrested seven persons in this connection.

""It was a huge organised racket operating in 16 states creating shell companies and fake GST registration by stealing data from PM Kisan, Rural employment scheme and other schemes,"" a senior official told ET.
These shell companies were used to generate fake bills, which were then sold to various companies to claim input tax credit. Three separate teams worked in a multi-state operation to create shell companies from stolen identities, generate fake e-way bills or fake invoices and supply invoices to companies that required them.
The official said in some cases people had been made directors of the companies without their knowledge, which came to light after they received tax notices at their address. Authorities will soon send notices to companies that availed these fake invoices to claim input tax credit.
The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has also recovered tax evasion in some cases, another official said.
Gujarat state GST officials had first detected a fake invoice racket using stolen IDs at Bhavnagar and Surat following which a nationwide drive was launched. Similar operations were subsequently conducted in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab and Haryana.
The official said field formations had been instructed to use documentary evidence before search and to take care that genuine businesses are not ""harassed.""

Net NPAs on course to fall to decadal best this fiscal: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/net-npas-on-course-to-fall-to-decadal-best-this-fiscal-report/articleshow/100972952.cms,13-06-2023,"The banking sector is on course to report the best asset quality in over a decade this fiscal, with headline gross NPAs and net NPAs falling to 2.63 per cent and 0.83 per cent, respectively, in March 2023, according to
Moody's
and its arm
Icra Ratings
. At the same time, the likely gross fresh
NPA
generation at 2 per cent will be the lowest since fiscal 2012, the agencies told reporters here Tuesday.
They also said the strong domestic demand, improving credit conditions of borrowers and strengthened solvency and funding will support further improvement in the credit quality of banks and
non-banking financial
institutions in spite of the challenging environment for banks globally.
The report expects the healthy profitability trend to continue, primarily driven by strong loan growth, which it sees to moderate to 11-11.7 per cent this fiscal from 15.5 per cent in fiscal 2023 and a favourable credit environment.
The trend of improving asset quality will continue with headline gross non-performing advances and net bad loans declining to their best level in over a decade, at 2.63 per cent and 0.83 per cent this fiscal from 3.96 per cent and 0.97 per cent, respectively, in fiscal 2023. At the same time, the gross fresh NPA generation rate of 2 per cent will be the lowest level since fiscal 2012, Alka Anbarasu, an associate managing director at Moody's and Karthik Srinivasan, a senior vice-president at Icra, told reporters.
While the year-on-year credit growth is likely to moderate with higher interest rates, the incremental credit growth is expected to be Rs 15-16 lakh crore, which is poised to become the banking sector's second-highest increase on record, they said.

Explaining the rationale for their optimism, they said credit conditions have gradually improved, with a significant reduction in the banks' stock of legacy NPA over the past three years. On the other hand, corporates' financial health has also improved following a decade of deleveraging. And stress among non-bank financial institutions has also abated.
""While banks globally are facing liquidity pressures amid tighter monetary policy, outflows of excess liquidity built up during the pandemic into more profitable investments and increased risk aversion among investors because of stress in the
US banking sector
, domestic banks, on the other hand, have strong funding franchises and ample liquidity to support growth in their loans in line with strong economic conditions,"" said Anbarasu.
Another enabler is the recapitalisation of banks following capital raisings from the equity market as well as capital infusions from the government for public sector banks. She expects the average return on tangible assets for banks to hold steady at 1-1.2 per cent over the next two years, which will support asset growth of around 15 per cent while keeping capital at current levels.
With deleveraged balance sheets, corporates' asset quality remains strong, which, coupled with the stable performance of the retail asset quality, will help to reduce fresh slippages in the asset quality of banks, said Srinivasan.
They also see the credit cost to moderate with rising asset quality, which in turn will translate to a steady return on assets and return on equity for banks at 1.1 per cent and 13.1 per cent, respectively, in the current fiscal.
On the other hand, private sector banks will continue to have higher RoA and RoE at 1.6 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, in fiscal 2024. Public banks will report their best RoE since fiscal 2013 at 13.4 per cent, inching closer to that of the private banks.
When it comes to India Inc, the agencies expect the credit quality to remain strong on the back of relatively higher economic growth, supportive government policies and investments in large infrastructure projects.
The report also expects private and government capex to surge amid the large size of new projects, improving capacity utilization levels, production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes and government initiatives toward clean energy.
While higher inflation will cause profitability to weaken, especially for sectors that are not able to pass on the increased cost, relatively strong economic growth will limit the earnings decline for corporates. This, combined with debt reduction over the past two-three years will keep credit metrics relatively well-positioned for their respective ratings, said Vikash Halan, an associate managing director at Moody's.

) of the
Ministry of Minority Affairs
is lying ""unused"" with the states, officials said on Monday. Till the state governments make use of these funds and submit ""utilisation certificates"", it is not possible for the Centre to make more funds available to them under the scheme, they said.
The officials also said more than 58,000 ""units"" under infrastructure projects that were part of the PMJVK sanctioned from 2008 to 2018-2019, which the states said were unviable, have been cancelled or dropped after the Ministry of Minority Affairs spoke to the states.
The officials said an amount of about Rs 12,000 crore was spent for the welfare of minorities under the
UPA
rule while in nine years of the
Narendra Modi
government, an amount of Rs 31,000 crore has been spent for the purpose.
The PMJVK, a centrally-sponsored scheme, is an area development programme under which community infrastructure and basic amenities are being created in the identified areas. The infrastructure built up under the scheme is for the benefit of all the people living in an area.
The scheme was restructured and implemented with effect from May 2018 as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK).

NARCL gives binding offers for two highway assets and a steel company,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/narcl-gives-binding-offers-for-two-highway-assets-and-a-steel-company/articleshow/100946942.cms,13-06-2023,"Government-promoted National Asset Reconstruction Company has given lenders binding offers to acquire loans of SEW LSY Highways, Haridwar Highways Project and Kamachi Steel, said people aware of the development.
Separately,
NARCL
is set to acquire loans of
SPML Infra
and
Dharani Sugars
following an uncontested Swiss auction, the people said.
If lenders approve a binding offer for the two road projects and the steel company, it will be followed by a Swiss challenge auction. NARCL's offer for the three companies is less than 10% of their outstanding dues, one of the persons said.
The state-backed bad bank's binding offer of ₹405 crore for SPML Infra, an engineering, procuring and construction (EPC) company, triggered a Swiss challenge auction schedule on June 6. NARCL is preparing to acquire the loan in cash and security receipts since lenders did not receive any counteroffer. Lenders will recover 33% of the dues from the sale of the EPC company.

Haridwar Highways Project is a special-purpose vehicle of
Era Infra Engineering
that won a contract from the National Highways Authority of India to strengthen the 80-km stretch from Muzaffarnagar in
Uttar Pradesh to Haridwar
in Uttarakhand. The total project cost escalated to ₹1,563 crore, which included loans of about ₹980 crore. In the past, lenders attempted to change the concessionaire but failed to find a replacement.
SEW LSY Highways, a special purpose vehicle promoted by
SEW Infrastructure
had won a contract for converting two lanes of a 206-kilometre stretch of the Delhi-Saharanpur-Yamunotri highway into four lanes. The company has loans of ₹1,700 crore, but the project was terminated by the Uttar Pradesh State Highways Authority, delaying debt servicing since 2014.
Kamachi Steels is a part of Kamachi Industries, undergoing liquidation under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
Meanwhile, another Swiss challenge auction of
Parenteral Drugs
is scheduled on Wednesday following a binding offer of ₹45 crore by NARCL on a loan of ₹112 crore.
In March, NARCL emerged as the winning bidder for the loans of
Dharani Sugars and Chemicals
at an uncontested Swiss auction. The ARC offered ₹222.5 crore to acquire the loan book of ₹619 crore, which equated to a recovery of 36% for lenders.
However, the NARCL will be able to close the deal only after the government issues a fresh guarantee on redemption of the security receipts, which has been pending since the beginning of this fiscal year. The shortfall in the recovery of loans promised by NARCL is guaranteed by the government.

UAE's investments in India are mainly in sectors like services, sea transport, power and construction activities.
One of the crucial factors for the increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) from UAE is the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between India and UAE on February 18, 2022 (effective from May 1, 2022), Pandey added.
""Apart from CEPA, another growth engine of FDI from UAE in India is the investment commitment from UAE. UAE has committed to invest USD 75 billion in the Indian infrastructure sector over a period of time. It has also committed to partner with India in the renewable energy sector,"" Pandey noted.
India and the UAE have operationalised a comprehensive free trade agreement since May 1 last year. Under the pact, a number of goods from both countries are getting zero-duty access to each other's markets, besides eased norms for promoting investments.
The country accounts for about 2.5 per cent of the total FDI India received between April 2000 and March 2023. During this period, India has attracted USD 15.6 billion worth of overseas inflows from the UAE, the data showed.
According to experts, the trade agreement has helped significantly increase the import and export between the countries and consequently increased the investments from UAE in Indian companies.
""India's constant liberalisation of the FDI policy also boosted such investments. Similarly, we are also seeing that several Indian startups are exploring expansion in the UAE,"" Anindya Ghosh, Partner, IndusLaw, said.
She said that among other agencies, Abu Dhabi Investment Office through their Innovation Program is providing active support to innovation-driven startups through financial and non-financial incentives like information on data, network, licensing, logistics, real estate, visa etc.
""Such expansion ideas/ activities of Indian startups also provide an incentive to UAE-based investment funds to invest more in innovation-based startups in India,"" Ghosh added.

Mobile GST hike gives government more than PLI outlay: Industry Executives,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/mobile-gst-hike-gives-government-more-than-pli-outlay-industry-executives/articleshow/100884799.cms,10-06-2023,"The incremental
GST
of 6% on mobile phones has raked in Rs 42,897 crore over the last three financial years, topping the nearly Rs 39,000-crore outlay of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacturing of smartphones and making the government scheme self-sustaining, according to industry executives.
In fact, the five-year smartphone PLI scheme will leave a revenue surplus of Rs 11,000 crore if only the Centre's GST (goods and services tax) collections are taken into consideration, industry body
India Cellular and Electronics Association
(
ICEA
) pointed out in a June 5 letter to the finance ministry.
The government had increased the GST on mobile phones to 18% from 12% on April 1, 2020, the day the smartphone PLI scheme was announced.
As per India ICEA, over the last three financial years-- FY21 to FY23--the incremental GST of 6% has resulted in an additional cumulative revenue of Rs 42,897 crore. The total GST on mobile phones for the three-year period stood at Rs 1,28,691 crore.
The final adjusted total outlay for the smartphone PLI scheme for a 5-year period now stands at Rs 38,601 crore as against the original Rs 41,000 crore, as iPhone-maker
Pegatron
started a year late. So far, the total disbursement for smartphone PLI stands at Rs 1,644 crore.

“Currently, since only Rs 1,644 crore has been claimed as part of the PLI scheme till March 31, 2023, the incremental GST has created a surplus of Rs 41,253 crore,” the ICEA said in the letter addressed to revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra.
Calculating that, the incremental GST over the course of the smartphone PLI scheme would be around Rs 1,01,697 crore, the ICEA said. Of this, the central government will collect Rs 50,849 crore while retaining only its 50% portion, far more than the total outlay of the scheme.
“In summary, even if only the Centre's GST was to be taken into consideration, the smartphone PLI scheme over the five-year period is 100% self-sustaining and will leave a revenue surplus of Rs 11,000 crore,” the industry body said.
The total GST contribution during the tenure of the smartphone PLI scheme is expected to the tune of over Rs 3 lakh crore. The scheme was deferred by one year for the majority of the companies due to the pandemic and will now end in 2025-26. All the selected companies, barring
Samsung
, have taken the deferment.
As per data shared with the government, since the scheme came into effect, over 120,000 new direct jobs have been created in the electronics sector, particularly in the smartphone manufacturing ecosystem.
On average, over 60% of these new jobs are now occupied by women in the age group of 19-24, most of whom are first-time job seekers. By conservative estimates, at least 250,000 new indirect jobs may have been created to support the fast-growing electronics manufacturing ecosystem.
The mobile phone exports have been gradually increasing due to the PLI scheme. In FY 2022-23, smartphone exports reached a high of $11.5 billion, a growth of over 50% over the previous year.
The government has set a target of achieving $300 billion worth of electronics manufacturing by 2025-26, with $120 billion expected to come from exports. In this, mobile phones exports are expected to contribute more than $50 billion by 2025-26, emphasising the importance of mobile phone manufacturing and exports within the electronic ecosystem.

L&T Finance gets 10 expressions of interest for distressed developer loans,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/lt-finance-gets-10-expressions-of-interest-for-distressed-developer-loans/articleshow/100884504.cms,10-06-2023,"L&T Finance has received a total of around 10 expressions of interest (EoIs) for 10 distressed developer loan-accounts with a combined outstanding of ₹3,022 crore.
Among the interested parties submitting EOIs are Kotak Mahindra-sponsored
Phoenix ARC
, Assets Care & Reconstruction Enterprise (ACRE), Asset Reconstruction Co (India) (Arcil),
Omkara Assets Reconstruction
and
Edelweiss
Asset Reconstruction Co.
The deadline for submitting firm bids is June 18.
The loan portfolio consists of 10 real estate developers including Supertech, Nirmal Lifestyle, and Anil Ambani-owned
Reliance
Infrastructure's special purpose vehicle SU Toll Road. The largest loan available for sale is attributed to
Nirmal Lifestyle
Developers, with an amount of ₹790 crore, followed by Nirmal Lifestyle Malls at ₹251 crore and
Supertech
at ₹515 crore.
L&T Finance is adopting a 15:85 structure, inviting EoIs from asset reconstruction companies, where L&T Finance's maximum share in security receipts will be 85%. Interested bidders were required to show their interest by June 5.
Live Events
Spokespersons of L&T Finance, ARCIL and Omkara did not respond to a request for comment.
Edelweiss ARC and ACRE spokesperson confirmed that they have submitted EOIs.
""Almost 10 ARCs have submitted EOIs but not all will submit firm bids for the assets,"" said a CEO of one of the ARCs that submitted a bid. ""L&T Finance has been trying to sell the Supertech loan for some time, but bidders have not shown interest in this loan.""
This move by L&T Finance is part of its ongoing efforts to reduce its wholesale book, encompassing both infrastructure finance and real estate finance. The company aims to focus more on retail loans and gradually exit wholesale lending. As of the end of FY23, retail loans accounted for 75% of L&T Finance's total loan book, according to the firm's statement on April 28.

Targeting 1 million CBDC users by June end: RBI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/targeting-1-million-cbdc-users-by-june-end-rbi/articleshow/100852272.cms,09-06-2023,"Mint Road is targeting one million central bank backed digital currency (

While it has no specific date in mind for a full-fledged launch of the CBDC, the central bank will take a measured approach, it said. The
RBI
also has plans to make the united payments interface (UPI) platform fully interoperable with the CBDC.
""We are not targeting a specific date, it will be a calibrated approach,"" said T Rabi Sankar, deputy governor, RBI. ""We want to assess the impact and learn as we go. By the end of June we are targeting 1 million CBDC users. We are also planning to make UPI QR code interoperable with CBDC.""
The CBDC is similar to the physical currency in terms of being a legal tender, accepted as a medium of payment and a safe store of value. The e-rupee is expected to provide an additional form of money to be used by the public.
The first pilot e-rupee in the retail segment was launched on December 1, 2022 in select locations in a closed user group comprising customers and merchants across the country. A pilot for e-rupee in the wholesale segment for settlement of secondary market transactions in government securities, was launched on November 1, 2022 with the participation of nine banks.

"50% of Rs 2,000 notes in circulation have come back to banks, reveals RBI",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/50-of-rs-2000-notes-in-circulation-have-come-back-to-banks-reveals-rbi/articleshow/100843390.cms,09-06-2023,"In about two weeks, almost half of the ₹2,000 currency notes in circulation, worth around ₹1.8 lakh crore, have come back to the banking system. Of this, 85% of ₹2,000 notes, which is ₹1.53 lakh crore has been deposited in bank accounts while the remaining were exchanged.
Either one can deposit the ₹2,000 currency note or exchange it with lower denomination currency but the exchange is allowed up to ₹20,000 at a time.
""We are reconciling the figures. But broadly, on a provisional basis, I can say that about 85% of the 2,000-rupee notes are coming back as deposits into bank accounts,"" said
RBI
Governor
Shaktikanta Das
.
The 2,000-rupee notes worth ₹3.62 lakh crore were in circulation as of March 31, 2023.
This is likely going to result in higher deposits for the banking system. Total deposits in the commercial banking system had grown 10.9% year-on-year to ₹183.7 lakh crore as on May 19. With 85% of the ₹2,000 currency note coming to banks, deposit growth may get a boost.

""We expected deposit and credit both to go up by ₹16 lakh crore in this year but with this, we expect deposit growth will improve further depending on how much gets retained in the banking system,"" said Anil Gupta, senior vice president at ICRA.
On May 19, RBI announced the decision to withdraw the ₹2,000 currency notes. RBI had asked people to deposit or exchange ₹2,000 currency notes from May 23. The notes can be deposited or exchanged by September 30. However, the RBI Governor made an appeal to avoid last minute rush in the last few days of September.
""Please avoid the last-minute rush in exchanging or depositing ₹2,000 notes. There is no shortfall in currency, we have ample notes for exchange. Don't panic, but don't keep it for the last days of September,"" Das said.

EPFO may hire separate consultants for equity and debt portfolios,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/epfo-may-hire-separate-consultants-for-equity-and-debt-portfolios/articleshow/100830588.cms,08-06-2023,"The
Employees' Provident Fund Organisation
is planning to hire two consultants to manage its debt and equity portfolio separately, instead of one so far, as the investments of the retirement fund body swell with an increase in the formal workforce.
A high-level committee will soon be formed to propose the division of work between two consultants.
The proposal was first mooted by the finance, investment and audit committee, a senior government official told ET. ""It is proposed to have two consultants, one focussing on debt side and the other on equity side and research, and for that purpose a committee is proposed to be constituted,"" the official said.
""
EPFO
will kick-start the process of appointing consultants once the recommendations of the committee are accepted,"" the official added.
A member of the central board of trustees of EPFO told ET on the condition of anonymity that appointment of two consultants instead of one has been a long pending requirement for EPFO whose portfolio has diversified over the years.
Live Events
""There will be sufficient checks and balances in place under the new system while it will reduce EPFO's dependence on a sole consultant. This is important as EPFO deals in high-value investments,"" the CBT member added.
The tenure of the incumbent consultant
Crisil
had come to an end on February 5 following which it has been given an extension till the time a new consultant is appointed and brought onboard.
An Employees' Provident Fund Organisation consultant is responsible for selection and evaluation of portfolio managers and acts as a custodian and concurrent auditor for the retirement fund body.
EPFO manages investments of over ₹18 lakh crore.

PFRDA
) chairman Deepak
Mohanty
said on Wednesday that the regulator is working on a
pension scheme
that could provide a minimum assured return.
""We are considering that product. We have made some progress. We will come out with that product, and at the same time, one would have to see that the return should be attractive,"" said Mohanty.
Earlier this week, Mohanty told ET that pension funds are thinly capitalised and will need to bring in solvency capital if they offer guaranteed returns.
The pension regulator noted on Wednesday that the minimum assured returns pension scheme is going to have a higher premium than others so that it can ensure attractive returns. Mohanty noted that in the case of an assured return, the pension fund has to provide more capital because it is taking on more risk.
""There we have to balance risk and return ...somebody gives assurance, and it will come with a cost. Like in APY, the government gives assurance, and they bear the cost,"" Mohanty said.

He added that there are about 5.3 crore subscribers to the
Atal Pension Yojana
(APY) and the centre is targeting to enrol 1.34 crore new subscribers this year.
Mohanty, however, refused to comment on the panel constituted to review the pension system for government employees, headed by finance secretary TV Somanathan.
The committee was set up against the backdrop of many states reverting back to the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and demanding the return of the NPS corpus.
""There is no provision in statute to return the pension amount as it belongs to contributors,"" he added.
The central government said in March that there is no provision in the PFRDA Act for a refund of the accumulated NPS corpus being sought by the five non-BJP states that want to restart the Old Pension Scheme.
The state governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh have informed the Centre about their decision to revert to the OPS and have requested a refund of corpus accumulated under the Nationale Pension System (NPS).

RBI's gold reserve up over 40% in five years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbis-gold-reserve-up-over-40-in-five-years/articleshow/100825558.cms,08-06-2023,"The
Reserve Bank of India
’s
gold
reserves have risen by over 40% since it resumed the purchase of the yellow metal over five years ago. This shows gold has emerged as a strong hedge against
inflation
and also helped reduce dependence on the dollar to an extent. India’s central bank, unlike others, never sells its gold.
India's official gold reserves is up from 17.9 million troy ounce in December 2017 to 25.55 million troy ounce in April this year according to the latest
RBI
data. This roughly translates to 795 metric tonnes of gold.
Central banks alone have bought 228 tonnes during January-April according to the latest World Gold Council report. "" Sustained and significant purchases from the official sector underscore gold’s role in international reserve portfolios during times of market volatility and heightened risk"" it said.
""The rising share of gold in reserves is likely part of RBI’s diversification strategy, to reduce the risk to reserves from shocks such as geopolitical risks and Covid-19 "" said Gaura Sengupta, India economist at
IDFC First Bank
."" As a result, the share of gold in India’s FX reserves has risen to 8% (in value terms) from 5% in 2017
Besides it also helped in protection of reserves from valuation impact of inflation. "" Increased gold purchases by central banks including India is a reflection of their diversification strategy amid increased FX/rates market volatility plus hedging against inflation"" said Anubhuti Sahay, head of Asia Economics Research at Standard Chartered Bank. "" Reserves in gold also help to counter-off valuation losses in a scenario of uncertainty which drives USD stronger and gold price higher"".

At a time when the supremacy of the dollar is being debated, a strategy to buy gold could mean lower dependence on the green back. "" The purchase of gold helps reduce dependence on dollar and dollar assets,"" said Sengupta."" In an inflationary environment gold provides a hedge as its price tends to rise. Post Covid-19 shock there has been a strong rise in gold prices as inflation pressures resurfaced"".
From the market perspective, data showed that at the time the RBI bought gold, retail purchases fell due to rising gold prices. But RBI buys gold to add to its foreign currency reserves more as a hedge against inflation than for profits.
RBI's 794.64 metric tonnes of gold included gold deposits of 56.32 metric tonnes, according to RBI's latest half yearly report on management of foreign exchange reserves. While 437.22 metric tonnes of gold is held overseas in safe custody with the Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), 301.10 metric tonnes of gold is held domestically. In value terms (USD), the share of gold in the total foreign exchange reserves increased from about 7.06 per cent as at end-September 2022 to about 7.81 per cent as at end-March 2023.
Gold may continue to be an important asset from central banks'
forex
reserve management perspective. "" Central bank buying is likely to remain strong and will be a cornerstone of demand throughout 2023 – even at lower levels than the record highs seen last year"" said Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council in the report. “As some economies teeter on the brink of recession, gold’s role as a long-term, strategic asset could take centre stage as it has a history of delivering positive returns in the last five out of seven recessions.”

The EPFO invests its funds based on the investment pattern notified by the finance ministry.
Under current guidelines, between 5% and 15% of the annual incremental deposits received by the EPFO can be invested in equity through ETFs, while the balance is invested in debt securities. There are no guidelines on utilising its ETF redemption proceeds.
According to the retirement fund body, the share of
equity investments
in the total Employees' Provident Fund corpus was only 10% as of January 2023 as against the permissible limit of 15%.
The EPFO started investing in equities through ETFs in 2015-16 with a 5% exposure. The equity investment limit was raised to 10% in 2016-17 and 15% in 2017-18.
Its cumulative investment in ETFs till March 31, 2022, stood at ₹1,01,712.44 crore, or 9.24% of total investment of ₹11,00,953.66 crore.
The EPFO redeems the ETF units on a periodic basis in order to generate income under the
Employees' Provident Fund scheme
. Since, the proceeds of ETF redemption are treated as income, only 15% of such redemption proceeds are currently invested into ETFs and remaining is invested in debt instruments.
In FY 2022-23, the EPFO had redeemed ETF units purchased for ₹15,692.43 crore during the calendar year 2018.

Pension regulator wants capital cover for assured return plans,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/pension-regulator-wants-capital-cover-for-assured-return-plans/articleshow/100775689.cms,06-06-2023,"India's pensions fund regulator will ensure that the entities offering
minimum assured return schemes
(MARS) are adequately capitalised and that there are enough firewalls to ensure there is no ""contamination"" with other pension schemes.
Unfunded schemes such as the old pension scheme are not sustainable, something that is being witnessed the world over,
Pension Fund Regulatory
and Development Authority (
PFRDA
) chairman Deepak Mohanty told ET in an interview.
Mohanty is a member of the committee looking into pension systems for government employees, set up after the clamour from multiple states to switch to the old pension scheme.
He said there could be a case for improvements in the National Pension System (
NPS
) scheme.
Mohanty, previously executive director at the Reserve Bank, took over as PFRDA chairman in March.
Live Events
There have been suggestions that pension schemes offer some assured minimum return options to subscribers.
Mohanty said the design of a product offering minimum assured returns is in the works. ""This would be an additional option ... Some work needs to be done,"" he said, adding that it needs to be seen that the return assured is attractive enough.
""If we come out with the product, we would also have to specify solvency separately for the managers ... We would also require separate norms to ensure there is no contamination,"" he said.
Pension funds are thinly capitalised and they will need to bring in solvency capital if they offer guaranteed returns, the PFRDA chairman pointed out.
The regulator will also roll out systematic withdrawal from the end of September, allowing subscribers to pull out funds at permitted intervals from their NPS account.
""We have already decided on it ... the Central Recordkeeping Agency is doing their system development. I would expect next quarter we should be able to roll it out,"" he said.
The regulator is working with pension funds to create an umbrella body, like the Indian Banks Association, to represent the sector and undertake developmental activities.
At the end of May, the NPS had a corpus of ₹9 lakh crore, up 29.1% from a year earlier. The number of subscribers, excluding
NPS Lite
, was 13.3 million, up 13.2% from a year earlier.
About 13,000 companies had been onboarded and the regulator is now planning an outreach to popularise NPS and also target professionals. The PFRDA is also trying to expand the intermediary space including the points of presence.
""We are planning to expand the universe ... We would be launching campaigns,"" he said, adding that one of the focuses would be to encourage people to take the product for their spouse or children.
Mohanty said the onboarding process had been smoothened with a digital interface reducing account opening to 10-15 minutes.
Old Pension Scheme vs New
Mohanty, who is a member of the finance secretary-led panel looking into the pension scheme for government employees, said there could be a case for improvement to the NPS. ""Certainly, there could be that it gets more acceptance,"" he said but declined to give any details about the deliberations of the committee.
He said the old pension scheme was an unfunded scheme whereas NPS is a defined contribution scheme. In many countries, it is also funded through payroll taxes and wherever funding has run short, pressures are visible, he said, adding: ""Unfunded schemes are completely not sustainable.""
States that have decided to move back to the defined benefit old pension scheme include Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.
The old pension scheme offered an assured pension linked to the last-drawn salary without any contribution from the employees, which made it fiscally unsustainable for the government.
In contrast, the new pension plan requires the employee and the employer, including the government, to make contributions during their working life. The subscriber can use the accumulated funds to buy an annuity or any other way to get a regular retirement income.

Sidbi's India Microfinance Equity Fund doesn't find many takers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/sidbis-india-microfinance-equity-fund-doesnt-find-many-takers/articleshow/100771785.cms,05-06-2023,"The Rs 300-crore
India Microfinance Equity Fund
(
IMEF
), which the
Small Industries Development Bank of India
(
Sidbi
) re-launched in November last year, does not seem to have many takers yet even as the small and medium sized microfinance lenders are longing for institutional funding support.
Several NBFC-MFIs found the clauses attached for taking the funding support from Sidbi quite stringent. They believe the clauses may create roadblocks in raising fresh equity from new investors.
One of the clauses says that NBFC-MFIs cannot take fresh equity capital at terms more favorable than those offered to Sidbi, unless such terms are approved by it.
Sidbi offers optionally convertible preference shares (OCPS) with a promise to convert them into equity before three years of the first tranche of the investment. Sidbi puts restrictions on raising fresh funds before conversion of the OCPS.
""Some of the clauses are more administrative in nature and could make the process of fresh fundraising slow. Normally, a minority shareholder does not ask for such stringent rules,"" a chief executive of a mid-sized NBFC-MFI said, on the condition of anonymity.

Sa-Dhan, the older of the two microfinance industry associations, has 69 members out of which 33 are small in size with below Rs 100 crore portfolio. These lenders need capital support the most since they don't get outside capital so easily.
""There are some misconceptions. Some of the MFIs see the possibility of losing management control if they take IMEF funds. We are reaching out to them and assuring them that the clauses are part of stardardised documents and Sidbi has no business in micro management,"" Sidbi chief general manager SP Singh told ET.
""The scheme is being actively promoted with an aim to support smaller and socially oriented MFIs as well as encourage new age MFIs looking to create impact and scale up operations in unserved and underserved areas,"" he said.
He added that Sidbi is currently evaluating 13 proposals with five of them having been circulated to the investment committee.
Last month, the development financial institution organized two workshops for members of the
Microfinance Institutions Network
and Sa-dhan to address the concerns.
The IMEF was initially launched in 2011 with an initial corpus of Rs 100 crore which was subsequently enhanced to Rs 300 crore. The scheme aimed to support relatively smaller MFIs by subscribing to their equity or providing quasi equity by subscribing OCPS issued by them. The scheme had lost momentum in between and was mostly non-functional in the past four-five years.

View: Banking sector recovery has given leg up to GDP growth,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/view-banking-sector-recovery-has-given-leg-up-to-gdp-growth/articleshow/100749402.cms,05-06-2023,"The recently announced betterthan-expected GDP growth number for 2022-23 has triggered discussions about the current Indian macroeconomic policies. The impressive recovery of the
banking sector
has contributed significantly to this turnaround. The recent handling of the banking system in India represents a textbook case of learning from past mistakes and using counter-cyclical policies in their true spirit.
A good starting point for understanding the contemporary banking landscape in India is the policy response to the
global financial crisis
(GFC). Rightly anticipating the spillover effects of the GFC, the Indian policymakers announced several counter-cyclical measures starting in August 2008. The most important among them was allowing banks to restructure loans without treating such loans as nonperforming assets (
NPAs
). In other words, a forbearance on loan loss recognition.
Banking regulators worldwide require banks to recognize the riskiness of restructuring transactions by treating them on par with NPAs and creating adequate provisions. Such provisions ensure that banks are well capitalized to deal with any future shocks arising from defaults on restructured loans. The requirement also prevents misuse of restructuring to postpone recognising loan losses.
Crisis times are different. Saving businesses from collapsing gets precedence over prudence in bank reporting practices. Justifiably, regulators allow and even encourage banks to restructure loans during such times. The Indian forbearance of 2008 was one such reasonable policy. It likely helped save several businesses that faced liquidity shocks during the GFC.

Problems arose when the policymakers continued the forbearance policy even after achieving full economic recovery. Banks started using forbearance to hide loan defaults: loans of low-quality borrowers were restructured to avoid recognition of losses.
Worse, banks relaxed the quality of screening for new loans as well. They could now lend to known bad-quality borrowers knowing fully well that restructuring can be used to hide loan defaults that may occur in the future.
Not surprisingly, when the forbearance policy was withdrawn in 2015, it was realized that the actual NPAs of banks were in double digits, and most banks did not have the required capital to absorb these losses. Expectedly, the flow of bank credit to the economy collapsed.
The most important learning from the post-GFC forbearance episode was that temporary relaxations granted during crisis periods work well only during the crisis. If they are continued beyond the crisis, they breed perverse effects having the potential to damage the economy in the long run.
Fortunately, the ""lesson"" learned based on the post-GFC crisis response was fully incorporated into the policy response to the Covid 19 induced crisis. The regulator did announce forbearance and other counter-cyclical policies, such as a temporary loan moratorium. However, all such policies came with well-defined expiration dates, which were adhered to with minor relaxation.
The figure below shows loan restructuring activity over time. The vertical axis represents the weighted average of the ratio between restructured and total assets of govt-owned banks.
The two vertical lines represent the years of the GFC and the
Covid crisis
, respectively. Notice a sharp increase in restructuring after the GFC; the level of restructuring kept increasing even after the crisis. It is critical to note most of the restructured loans were, in spirit, NPAs evergreened under the forbearance window. In contrast, despite forbearance, the overall level of restructuring hardly increased during and after the Covid crisis.
To understand the contrast more clearly, we plot the sum of restructured and NPAs as a proportion of banks' total assets in the figure below. These can be considered distressed assets. Notice a sharp increase in distressed assets after GFC and continuation of a decreasing trend of distressed assets after Covid crisis.
Finally, we also examine the quality of borrowers. The purpose here is to understand whether banks' exposure to existing low-quality borrowers changed after the two crises. A borrower whose income is less than the total amount required for servicing debt is considered a low-quality borrower. Repeated lending to existing low-quality borrowers is a strong signal of evergreening, where new loans are used to hide defaults on existing loans. We obtain this information from the registry of charges maintained by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The figure below contrasts the situation before and after the two crises. In line with the earlier evidence, banks increased lending to low-quality borrowers after the GFC but not after Covid.
In sum, one important reason for the sound health of the banking system in India today is the active policy choices made by the policymakers and their willingness to learn from past mistakes.

"Private capex to see broad-based revival in FY24, says CII chief",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/private-sector-investment-set-to-witness-significant-increase-cii-president/articleshow/100740429.cms,05-06-2023,"Capital expenditure by the private sector is set for a much more broad-based resurgence this fiscal than in recent years, ushering in a virtuous investment cycle to stir economic growth,
R Dinesh
, president of Confederation of Indian Industry (
CII
), has said.
The
Reserve Bank of India
's rate-setting panel is likely to hold on to the rates in this week's review, the
CII president
for 2023-24 told ET.
He said new investment proposals have risen as post-pandemic uncertainties ebb, and capacity utilisation across sectors have breached the crucial 75% mark, triggering fresh investment needs.
Even those sectors that don't directly benefit from the government's capital spending push have witnessed a spurt in capacity utilisation, Dinesh said, citing the latest CII survey.
He exuded confidence that manufacturing, which reversed two quarters of contraction to grow 4.5% in the January-March period, will put up a more robust show in the June quarter.

Chemicals, machinery, consumer goods, steel and cement have led the pack in capacity utilisation in manufacturing. Among services, transportation, information technology, and aviation services have used capacity the most, he said.
Monetary policy
While Dinesh acknowledged the prudence in the central bank's approach to stay cautious until the war against inflation is won, he urged it to switch to a neutral stance now. ""By October, we think there would be another opportunity for the
RBI
to decide whether it can take a different stance,"" he said.
Demand in both rural and urban India has turned the corner, he said, pointing at robust FMCG and automobile sales. And with a moderation in inflation, private consumption, too, is going to get a fresh leg-up, he said.
""The perception today is that inflation will go down and, therefore, I can afford to spend. So, I think it's a mindset change which has taken place. Inflation expectations are under control,"" he added. The CII has projected FY24 economic growth at 6.5-6.7%, among the most optimistic projections.
Financing growth
Dinesh dwelt upon three ""thoughts"" for the country to finance growth on a sustained basis.
First, banks need to come up with innovative ways and instruments to fund growth-""it cannot be just term loans, etc."" Second, efforts must be stepped up to keep drawing overseas investments. ""And last but not the least, energy transition. How do we manage this without affecting our growth?"" he said. ""All three are the core focus areas for CII,"" Dinesh said, indicating a closer collaboration with the government and investors to achieve these objectives.
He also called for sector-specific roadmaps to spur growth without upsetting climate goals.
Rs 2,000 note withdrawal
Dinesh said no CII member has yet flagged concerns about any negative fallout of the move to withdraw the Rs 2,000 notes from the system by September 30, and the deposit window is also long. In any case, this will likely improve the liquidity conditions of the banks, he added.
Green mobility
Dinesh said the first focus of any green mobility policy should be the public transportation, and not two-or-three-wheeler vehicles. The storage and charging systems for electric vehicles should be ramped up to bolster the overall ecosystem for green mobility.

Sahara India's life insurance business to be transferred to SBI Life,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/sahara-indias-life-insurance-business-to-be-transferred-to-sbi-life/articleshow/100707759.cms,02-06-2023,"India's insurance regulator has identified
SBI Life Insurance Company
Limited (SBI Life), which is one of the largest life insurers in the country, as the acquirer insurer of the
life insurance
business of
Sahara India Life Insurance
Co. Ltd (SILIC).
SBI Life
shall take over the policy liabilities of around two lakh policies of SILIC, backed by the policyholders’ assets, with immediate effect, the insurance regulator said.
Sahara India Life Insurance was granted registration certificate in 2004 to transact the business of life insurance. ""In view of the certain serious issues on the financial propriety and governance aspects of the insurer"", the insurance regulator had appointed an Administrator to manage the business of the insurer in 2017. The insurer was also not allowed to underwrite new business.
""Despite being provided ample opportunities and sufficient time to ensure compliances, SILIC has failed to comply with directions of the Authority and take any affirmative steps to protect the interests of its policyholders. Further, the policy data of SILIC reveals that the company’s portfolio is showing run-off trend. The financial position has been deteriorating with rising losses and higher percentage of claims to total premium,"" the insurance regulator said in a statement.
""If the trend is allowed to continue, the situation will worsen and lead to erosion of capital and SILIC may not be able to discharge its liabilities towards policyholders, thereby endangering the interest of its policyholders,"" the regulator said.
So the authority in its meeting held today ""decided that action is warranted to protect the interest of the policyholders of SILIC. Accordingly, the Authority decided to transfer the life insurance business of SILIC to another suitable life insurer with immediate effect.""

The GST collection rose 12% from a year earlier to ₹1.57 lakh crore in May while the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) climbed to 58.7 from 57.2 in Arpil. ""May
PMI
and GST data show that underlying momentum in the economy remains resilient, largely based on domestic factors,"" said Rahul Bajoria of Barclays.
Diesel demand increased 9.3% to 7.46 million tonnes in May, accelerating from April's 6.7% increase. Petrol demand grew 10.4% compared with last year.
Automobile sales remained robust with EVs continuing to post strong numbers. Auto companies dispatched 334,800 cars, sedans and utility vehicles to dealerships in May, an increase of 13.5% from last year, with market leader
Maruti Suzuki
posting 15.5% growth. Sales of electric two-wheelers more than doubled YoY to 104,771, breaching the 100,000 mark for the first time.

On Wednesday, the CII said it expects GDP to grow 6.5-6.7% in FY24.
RBI
expects 6.5% growth.
The continuing economic momentum will encourage the RBI to keep holding rates to gauge the impact of the 2.5 percentage point rise in interest rates since May 2022. The strong data ""will add to RBI's conviction next week,"" said Bajoria. The Monetary Policy Committee meets June 6-8.
Robust GST
GST collections were lower than the highest-ever level of ₹187,035 crore in April, which was boosted by the year-end effect. A finance ministry statement said monthly GST revenue crossed the ₹1.5 lakh crore mark for the fifth time since the levy began in July 2017.
""...it reflects a continuation of the inherently good economic performance across states witnessed since last year,"" said MS Mani, partner, Deloitte India.
""With extensive department GST audits lined up before September, these figures may likely go up from here in the months to come,"" said Abhishek Jain, partner and national head, indirect tax, KPMG in India said.
Most states registered double-digit growth. ""GST revenues in May 2022 have modestly exceeded our expectations,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist,
ICRA
.
Of the total, central GST was ₹28,411 crore, state GST was ₹35,828 crore and integrated GST ₹81,363 crore, including ₹41,772 crore collected on import of goods.
Manufacturing strength
A rise in advertising, demand strength and a favourable economic climate pushed factory orders to the highest levels since January 2021, the PMI survey showed. Employment growth, which has remained muted until now, also picked up.

"India is 'capital starved', needs to work towards getting capital to become USD 5-trillion economy: Ajay Piramal",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-is-capital-starved-needs-to-work-towards-getting-capital-to-become-usd-5-trillion-economy-ajay-piramal/articleshow/100684990.cms,01-06-2023,"India is ""capital starved"" and if the country has to meet its aspiration of 8 per cent growth to reach USD 5 trillion economy, it needs to work towards getting capital,
Piramal Group
Chairman and Executive Director
Ajay Piramal
said on Thursday. Speaking at the
Times Network India Economic Conclave
2023, he said India must learn from the rest of the world and allow pension funds and provident funds to invest into many companies instead of restricting them into investing mainly on government securities.
Piramal, who was bullish on the future of the Indian economy, said this is the best time the country has had and ""we want to grow faster"".
Pointing out concerns towards achieving the higher growth, he said,""...if India has to grow at 8 per cent GDP, which is what our aspiration is if you want to go to a (USD) 5 trillion, and then 10 trillion, generally in real terms...then credit must grow at approximately 18 to 20 per cent.""
He said credit growth of 18 to 20 per cent has never happened in India.
""I don't think we have the banks or the NBFCs or anybody who can grow it that much. So we are capital starved and therefore we have to work towards getting capital,"" Piramal asserted.

There are many opportunities that India can learn from what the rest of the world has done, he said, adding the country can look at opening up pension funds and provident funds etc, which are currently not allowed to ""invest in too many companies"".
""With the regulations becoming tighter and better in India, I think we will have to open this. These funds are available. Today 50 per cent of all these funds go into government securities, I think they must be allowed to be invested into companies,"" Piramal said.
He cited the examples of Canada and Singapore, which have used pension funds to invest in other countries and get good returns for their holders.
Piramal also expressed concern that ""the cost of capital in India is extremely high and we are becoming very, very uncompetitive, and I don't think we can raise a 10 per cent growth unless we open this up.""
He also called for opening up the banking sector by giving licences to more private players.
""I don't know what the hesitation is to give banking licences to private players,"" he said, adding after the banking licences were given two decades ago to the likes of Kotak,
HDFC
and
IndusInd
, there's been no major bank that's come up.
Piramal further said,""And we've seen these have been successful. So why not give it more and now the regulators in India are much better. I feel that shortage of equity, shortage of debt is going to be a constraint.""

CREDAI-MCHI urges finance minister to change redevelopment projects’ GST structure,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/credai-mchi-urges-finance-minister-to-change-redevelopment-projects-gst-structure/articleshow/100674960.cms,01-06-2023,"Real estate developers have approached the
Ministry of Finance
with their concerns over the impact of the Goods & Services Tax (GST) being levied on rehabilitation apartments being built and given back, free of cost, to existing occupants as part of redevelopment projects.
The Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (
CREDAI
) - MCHI, has written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to request a change in GST structure to ensure viability of redevelopment projects in
Mumbai Metropolitan Region
(MMR).
Real estate projects involving redevelopment and rehabilitation are the mainstay of Mumbai’s property market as the land-starved city has few vacant land parcels. At present, around 19,000 properties in the city are awaiting redevelopment.
“The Mumbai Metropolitan Region is one of the most valuable real estate markets in India. However, it must be noted that a conducive redevelopment eco-system is required for the region to fully realize its potential, as there are numerous dilapidated buildings with roughly 50% of population still residing in the slums or old, dilapidated buildings,” said Boman Irani, President, CREDAI National.
Irani along with other members of CREDAI MCHI met the finance minister to make a formal representation on this matter.

According to Irani, while there have been measures taken by the government to promote more redevelopment projects, there is a need to course correct certain aspects from a regulatory and taxation standpoint. This will not only help enhance economic value but also facilitate both demand and supply for such projects in the long run, which mostly fall in the low and middle-income category and cater to the masses of a bustling city.
The regulations for redevelopment in the Mumbai region are covered under the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR) 2034 that encourages such projects with a higher floor space index (FSI). However, the developers’ body believes that the GST being levied on the same defeats the purpose of rehabilitating existing tenants and enhancing real estate value as it puts the financial feasibility of numerous projects under severe risk.
Currently, providing new houses to existing occupants, tenants, flat owners, and slum dwellers and selling the flats, shops, offices under sale component in the open market are being viewed as separate transactions leading to higher tax obligations.
According to CREDAI, the flats to existing occupants, slum dwellers, tenants, flat owners are provided free of cost and hence GST need not be charged where there is no consideration.

Is real estate a high or low risk investment?
In effect, 10% GST is currently being charged on flats--5% on rehab and 5% on sale both borne by ultimate consumers--being sold from the sale component.
The economics of redevelopment projects, a type of an urban real estate renewal method where realty players takeover old buildings and rebuild them, is facing challenges due to higher GST costs.
The cost of construction of the rehabilitation component is already subsumed in the cost of sale component and hence taxing both rehab and sale separately would lead to double taxation. Sale component is already offered for GST and hence in effect value of construction of rehabilitation is also offered for GST being within it, the developers’ body said.
It has also submitted that construction of rehabilitation part is an input service that is a prerequisite for construction of sale component, which is the output service,
Projects that can absorb the additional GST burden, the eventual customers of the sale component bear the same as the cost of their apartments increases. The project unable to absorb this additional cost put by GST on rehab at notional valuations, the existing tenants or slum dwellers suffer as the project does not take off, the developers’ body added.

"Transactions between 2 govt firms exempt from prior nod requirements by audit committee for RPTs, says Sebi",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/transactions-between-2-govt-firms-exempt-from-prior-nod-requirements-by-audit-committee-for-rpts-says-sebi/articleshow/100659550.cms,01-06-2023,"Transactions entered into between two state-run companies are exempted from taking prior approval of the audit committee and shareholders for related-party transactions, markets regulator Sebi clarified on Wednesday. The clarification came after
NTPC
sought informal guidance about related party transactions (RPTs) under the LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) rules.
The state-owned company has sought clarification on whether approval of an audit committee is required for transactions between NTPC and
PTC India
, and
Energy Efficiency Services Ltd
(EESL), where nominee directors are appointed by the
Government of India
.
Further, NTPC said it has invested in PTC India and holds a 4.05 per cent stake in the company. Besides, the same percentage of shares are held by three other promoters --
NHPC
,
PFC
, and PGCIL.
As per the shareholding pattern, promoters hold a 16.22 per cent stake and the remaining 84.78 per cent stake is with foreign institutions, mutual funds, financial institutions, and the general public.
EESL is a joint venture between four public sector undertakings (PSUs) -- NTPC,
PowerGrid
,
REC
, and PFC.
Live Events
Responding to the query, Sebi said that government nominee directors are appointed on the board of PTC and EESL. However, neither PTC nor EESL are government companies. Hence, exemptions are not applicable and prior approval of the audit committee would be required for RPTs with PTC or EESL as the case may be.
Further, the regulator said that all RPTs and subsequent material modifications will require prior approval of the audit committee of the listed company. The committee may grant omnibus clearance for proposed RPTs and such approval would be valid for one year.
Providing informal guidance, the
Securities and Exchange Board of India
(Sebi) indicated that its views might differ on a case-to-case basis.

Service sector cushions India’s economy from high interest rates,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/service-sector-cushions-indias-economy-from-high-interest-rates/articleshow/100636272.cms,31-05-2023,"India’s economic growth probably matched government estimates as demand spurred an expansion in the services sector and cushioned the impact of elevated
interest rates
.
Data due Wednesday is likely to show gross domestic product in the year to March 2023 grew 7%, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey that’s in line with a government forecast made three months ago. While this is slower than the previous fiscal year’s expansion of 9.1%, India is still recording one of the fastest growth rates among major world economies.
The survey showed Asia’s third-biggest economy probably grew 5% in January to March, from a year ago. While this is an acceleration from the previous quarter, uneven
monsoon
rains and an emerging global slowdown may put a spanner in the works.
Bloomberg
“High frequency indicators showed improvement in the last quarter,” said
Abheek Barua
, chief economist at
HDFC Bank
. “Corporate margins grew, government investment activity remained strong, especially in construction of roads, consumption demand kept steady amid slightly lower inflation level.”

Will India's March quarter GDP data spring a pleasant surprise?
India’s resilient growth could reassure the central bank that its monetary tightening hasn’t taken a big toll on the economy and give it more room to pause for a second straight meeting on June 8. This is an outcome predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Reserve Bank of India Governor
Shaktikanta Das
floated the possibility last week that the previous year’s growth could be more than 7% as data showed momentum in the latest quarter. He warned that the war against inflation isn’t over yet and the current hold on rates was more of a pause than a pivot.
Inflation slowed to 4.7% in April after staying above the RBI’s target ceiling of 6% for much of the last fiscal year. That’s raising hopes for market watchers that borrowing costs won’t go up from here, supporting consumption and investment before national elections next summer.
The yield on benchmark 10-year bond has dropped below 7% from its June high of 7.6%, while the benchmark stock index is hovering around its all-time high amid continued purchases from foreign investors.

Services Support
Services have emerged as a key growth driver, comprising more than half of the nation’s GDP. India has been gaining market share in information technology and business consulting work, boosting services activity to the highest in almost 13 years.
The data may show trade, hotel and transportation and government expenditure picked up pace in the last quarter, according to Gaura Sen Gupta, an economist at
IDFC First Bank
. Consumption in the urban areas likely remained healthy on formal sector job creation, while rural demand could be showing “nascent sign of recovery” led by increase in wages, she said.
""1Q23 growth looks likely to come in faster than we have expected due to a combination of a favorable harvest, government subsidies that are boosting manufacturing, and stronger service exports underpinned by multinationals shifting back-office business to India.""
— Abhishek Gupta, Bloomberg Economics
The Finance Ministry’s top economic adviser told Bloomberg last week that strong credit demand and softening crude oil prices could buoy the economy, putting India on course for a 6.5% expansion this fiscal year that started April 1. The International Monetary Fund pegs it even lower at 5.9%, but the prospects are still better than China that is expected to show a growth of 5.2% in 2023.
There are signs of goods exports slowing but a bigger blow for India could come from inadequate rains for crops such as rice, corn and soyabeans, which will slow the rural economy that makes up about half of the nation’s GDP.

Sharp jump in foreign exchange income boosts RBI dividend for FY2023,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/sharp-jump-in-foreign-exchange-income-boosts-rbi-dividend-for-fy2023/articleshow/100625009.cms,31-05-2023,"Mumbai:
The central bank’s foreign exchange transactions and the absence of excess liquidity helped it nearly triple its dividend payments to the government for FY23.
While income for the year increased 47.06%, the expenditure was up 14.05%. The year ended with an overall surplus of 87,416.22 crore that was transferred to the government in the form of dividend as against 30,307.45 crore in the previous year, the Reserve Bank of India’s (
RBI
) latest annual report showed.
The
RBI’s surplus transfer
was more than the budgeted amount of 48,000 crore for the banking sector.
“The substantial jump in dividend is driven by profits made on foreign exchange transactions (1,03,300 crore), due to large gross dollar sales in FY23,” said Gaura Sengupta, India economist,
IDFC First Bank
.
Based on RBI intervention data, gross dollar sales amounted to $212.6 billion in FY'23 compared to $96.7 billion in FY'22. In addition, higher interest income (1.3 trillion) on its holdings of domestic and foreign securities has more than offset losses on its liquidity operations.

The size of the balance sheet increased 2.50% 2022 to 63.44 lakh crore as on March 31, 2023. The increase on the asset side was due to a rise in foreign investments, gold, and loans and advances by 2.31%, 15.30 % and 38.33%, respectively, the RBI said.
On the liability side, the expansion was due to an increase in notes issued, revaluation accounts and other liabilities by 7.81%, 20.50%, and 79.07%, respectively. Domestic assets constituted 27.69% while foreign currency assets and gold (including gold deposit and gold held in India) constituted 72.31% of total assets as on March 31, 2023, as against 28.22% and 71.78%, respectively, as on March 31, 2022.
Based on RBI intervention data, gross dollar sales worth $212.6 billion in FY23 v/s $96.7 billion in FY22.
“From a fiscal perspective, the dividend represents additional revenue of 0.2% of GDP. However, it may be too early to say with certainty that FY24 fiscal deficit will undershoot the 5.9% GDP target,” said Sengupta. “This is because the sharp reduction in inflation (in particular WPI inflation) implies that FY24 nominal GDP growth could be lesser than what is assumed in the
Union Budget
of 10.9%.”
Nominal GDP
IDFC Bank’s model indicates nominal GDP growth could be ~9%. This implies that tax collection growth could be lower than what is assumed in the Budget Estimate. There is also the risk that disinvestment proceeds could undershoot the Budget Estimate.

tax collection
here is one of the highest and the income tax rate should be reduced to 25 per cent from around 40 per cent at present, eminent economist
Surjit Bhalla
said. While speaking to PTI, Bhalla said reduction in tax rate is required to accelerate the pace of
economic growth
.
""We are a much more globalised economy in the world and the world is a lot more globalised. If you look at the overall tax rate structure in India, collection of taxes is one of the highest in the world and we are not the richest economy of the world,"" Bhalla said.
He said that tax collection by state, Centre and local bodies is around 19 per cent of India's GDP.
""We should move towards reducing it by 2 percentage points. As far as direct taxes are concerned, I think the overall tax rate should not be more than 25 per cent. Right now it is close to 40 with surcharges etc. 25 per cent, which is our
corporate tax rate
, that's what our income tax rate should be,"" Bhalla said.
Currently, the highest income tax rate in India stands at 39 per cent. The Budget 2023-24 had lowered India's highest rate of income tax from 42.74 per cent, by reducing the surcharge applicable on high net-worth individuals.

Bhalla said that taxes need to come down for all and not just benefit a select section of the society.
India's
gross direct tax collection
during the last fiscal ended March 2023 grew over 20 per cent to Rs 19.68 lakh crore.
This includes gross corporate tax collection growth of 16.91 per cent at over Rs 10.04 lakh crore. Gross personal I-T collection jumped 24.23 per cent to over Rs 9.60 lakh crore.
Bhalla said
direct tax
is one of the areas where there is a lot of bureaucratic involvement and it should be a lot more streamlined to minimise
tax evasion
.
""You cannot minimise tax evasion without doing something about very very high rates of income taxation. We need to change the tax structure so that everyone benefits rather than some selected sectors,"" he said.

While credit card issuance is expected to grow at a healthy CAGR of 21 per cent in the next five years, debit card issuance is expected to have a stagnant growth with a CAGR of 3 per cent in the same period, the report said.
""The decline in debit card usage is because the major use case of debit card transactions is cash withdrawal, which can now be replaced by an easier way of withdrawing cash using UPI,"" it added.
Mihir Gandhi, Partner and Payments Transformation Leader, PwC India, said that in the next five years, the payments industry is expected to focus on ecosystem expansion and new use cases for existing payment platforms.
""Areas like embedded and ecosystem finance, digital lending based on payment transactions and offline payments will drive the next phase of growth for the payments industry. In the ever-evolving Indian payments landscape, innovation and inclusion are paving the way for a seamless digital economy,"" Gandhi said.
The PwC report further said revenue through the credit card business accounts for nearly 76 per cent of the overall cards' revenue in 2022-2023, making it a lucrative business segment for banks, NBFCs and FinTech.
The revenue for credit card issuance increased by 42 per cent in 2022-2023 compared to 2021-2022 and is likely to grow by a CAGR of 33 per cent for the next five years, it added.

CBIC extends deadline for filing April GST return for Manipur-based biz till May 31,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cbic-extends-deadline-for-filing-april-gst-return-for-manipur-based-biz-till-may-31/articleshow/100504937.cms,25-05-2023,"The
CBIC
has extended the deadline till May 31 for Manipur-based businesses to file monthly GST returns, as the north eastern state continues to witness violence due to ethnic clashes. The
Central Board of Indirect Taxes and
Customs (CBIC) has issued three Central Tax notifications which said that the due date for filing returns GSTR-1, GSTR-3B and GSTR-7 for the month of April by registered persons whose principal place of business is in
Manipur
has been extended till May 31.
Manipur-registered businesses were to file GSTR-1, which is the statement of outward supplies, for April by May 11.
April GSTR-3B, which is the monthly tax payment form, was to be filed by May 20. GSTR-7, which was to be filed by businesses who deduct tax at source, for April was filed by May 10.
Clashes broke out in Manipur after a '
Tribal Solidarity
March' was organised in the hill districts on May 3 to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.
The violence in Manipur was preceded by tension over the eviction of
Kuki
villagers from reserve forest land, which had led to a series of smaller agitations.

Eco growth at risk if fossil fuel-based power projects are avoided: CEA Nageswaran,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/economic-growth-at-risk-if-financial-sector-avoids-funding-fossil-fuel-based-power-projects-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/100498123.cms,25-05-2023,"Addressing the need for developing countries to ensure energy availability,
India
's Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran on Thursday said the financial sector altogether avoiding funding fossil fuel-based power generation projects would put India's economic growth in jeopardy.
""No doubt, addressing global warming is important. But it's also equally important for developing countries to ensure that there is adequate and affordable energy available for powering economic growth,"" the
CEA
said at a CII event.
He said that if India's economic growth is put in jeopardy, then generations of fiscal and private sector resources will too be in trouble.
Further, he said that green financiers need to take into account the fact that India can't completely swear off fossil fuel.
For Nageswaran, the single biggest worry for sustaining the growth rate that India has been able to achieve in the last two years is energy security. Energy security has come under the scanner in recent years owing to geopolitical developments.

""No doubt, addressing global warming is important. But it's also equally important for developing countries to ensure that there is adequate and affordable energy available for powering economic growth,"" he said.
The G7 countries have asked all major economies, including India and China, to commit to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and let their emissions peak by 2025.
India at a crossroads
India, the world's second-largest coal consumer and fifth-largest economy, is also at a key economic crossroads as its own momentum is checked by a slowdown in global goods demand due to rising interest rates and high energy and living costs.
India is also expected to face growing scrutiny over its practices of importing crude oil and other energy products from Russia despite international efforts to sanction Moscow following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
At COP26 in the UK, India had committed to a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2070. Net zero means achieving a balance between the greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere and those taken out.
India submitted its long-term low emission development strategy (LT-LEDS) to the UN climate body at COP27 in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh, detailing what it would do to achieve the net zero emissions target by 2070.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that India will spend $53 billion and $87 billion of average annual investment in 2021-25 and 2026-30, respectively, to achieve the Stated Policy Scenario (STEPS) trajectory of emissions reductions. Ratings agency Moody's said that bulk of the estimated investment will be allocated to clean energy and related projects.

Ashwani K Muthoo

The absence of a country strategy poses challenges to project performance, Muthoo said in an interview with ET, even after expressing satisfaction over the execution of the first project his office evaluated in India.
The New Development Bank, earlier called
BRICS Development Bank
, was set up in 2015 to finance public and private projects through loans, guarantees and equity participation.
“Projects in India are showing promising progress, thanks to the dedicated commitment and support from the department of economic affairs,” Muthoo said. “State-level authorities are also actively engaged and enthusiastic about securing NDB financing for various projects.”
However, he outlined a few areas which require attention to optimise project outcomes.

“Despite its success, certain areas posed challenges to project performance. These included the absence of a comprehensive country strategy to guide the India-NDB partnership, insufficient analytical work to inform decision-making during the design phase, weak supervision, implementation support, monitoring, and evaluation, and limited attention to knowledge management,
policy engagement
, and innovation,” he said.
The independent evaluation office (IEO) is a new structure within NDB to promote accountability and drive quality and development impact of the multilateral bank. The IEO is independent of the management of the NDB and reports directly and exclusively to the board of directors.
India, the founding member of NDB, is the second largest recipient of NDB's financial support ($7.5 billion) after China. NDB approved 20 projects in India while seven more proposals are being reviewed.
Overall, NDB supported 96 projects across the globe with $33 billion of financing commitment till December 2022.
The first project evaluation by IEO in India was that of the Madhya Pradesh Major District Roads Project, which was approved in November 2016 with the objective of improving the state’s connectivity of the rural regions and achieving a larger coverage of the national and state highways.
The project not only achieved its original targets but surpassed them. Over 1,551 km of major district roads were upgraded, exceeding the initial design target of 1,500 km, according to official records.
“The road connectivity project in Madhya Pradesh has significantly improved livelihoods and strengthened regional connectivity,” Muthoo said. “By focusing on access to roads and working closely with federal and state governments, the project has positively impacted the local communities.”
This year, the IEO is evaluating another two loans, amounting to $2 billion, provided to India for Covid-19 emergency response and socio-economic recovery after the pandemic.
It is also evaluating NDB’s financial architecture. “This is a very strategic evaluation to assess NDB’s capacity to mobilise resources to advance its mandate and activities,” he said.
NDB has nine members, including the inaugural members Brazil, Russia China and South Africa, and the new members--United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Bangladesh, and Egypt.

Piyush Goyal
said Wednesday. He also asked the Indian industry to do business with reliable partners in the supply chain.
Goyal exuded confidence on achieving $1 trillion each of goods and services exports by 2030.
""I have no doubt we are going to achieve it... our import basket largely gets affected by oil that will have its own trajectory, possibly a lowering trajectory or a downward trend in the years to come, whereas our export basket has all the things that the world desires,"" the minister said at industry body
CII
's annual session.
Drawing on Michael Porter's competitive advantage theory, Goyal said: ""There are several goods where India can become self-reliant. There are unnecessary imports, often of low quality and very poor, sub-standard goods, unsafe to use"".
He said that the overall exports had been at $500 billion for almost a decade but reached $776 billion in FY23 with $450 billion of merchandise exports and $326 billion of services exports.

View: It’s bankruptcy that needs a rescue in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/view-its-bankruptcy-that-needs-a-rescue-in-india/articleshow/100460062.cms,24-05-2023,"In the seven years that it has been around, Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
’s signature
bankruptcy
reform has failed to live up to its billing.
The 2016 insolvency law was crafted when the country was just starting to tackle what would eventually rank among the worst piles of bad loans anywhere in the world: a $200 billion-plus menace. With banks garnering bumper profits in the post-pandemic high interest-rate environment, that baggage is now much lighter, and the urgency to deal with it lower.
It shouldn’t be. Creditors’ recovery rates on soured advances have been low for the past couple of years — and they’re falling. Liquidations are the most common result of the bankruptcy tribunal’s proceedings, which are taking more than twice as long as the 270 days envisaged originally. When the credit cycle turns, state-run lenders may once again run crying back to taxpayers for capital. The court won’t give them back much.
In a country where savings are in short supply, the priority was always to prevent productive capital from going to waste in unviable projects. Some high-profile resolutions of defaulted steel-plant loans raised creditors’ hopes, but rampant gaming of the legal process by vested interests is dashing them.
Which is why the bankruptcy protection sought by Go Airlines India Ltd., a cash-strapped carrier controlled by the Mumbai-based
Wadia Group
, is so crucial. The franchise temporarily shut down earlier this month. If the court can’t quickly revive
Go First
, as the brand is now known, the risk is that it will be grounded forever, like
Kingfisher Airlines Ltd
. in 2012 and
Jet Airways India Ltd
. in 2019. The domestic aviation market will become even more of a duopoly than it already is.
Live Events
But rescuing Go First could be seen as bailing out the billionaire
Nusli Wadia
by inflicting losses on SMBC Aviation Capital, ACG Aircraft Leasing Ireland Ltd., and other aircraft lessors. SMBC, which claims to have ended its lease before Go First’s filing, wants to take its jets away. The bankruptcy protection, the lessors have alleged, is a “fraudulent exercise.” On Monday, the appellate authority rejected their challenge: They need to approach the tribunal to repossess the planes with expired leases, or go to the apex court.
It’s a complicated bankruptcy. About half of Go First’s Airbus fleet has been incapacitated by failures of Raytheon Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney engines. The airline has claimed 74 billion rupees ($894 million) in compensation. A Singapore-based arbitration panel has asked Pratt & Whitney to “immediately begin making reasonable efforts” to locate suitable spares. The engine-maker has said that it will honor the award. But since it hasn’t supplied the first batch of 10 engines that the tribunal asked it to try to deliver by April 27, Go First filed for bankruptcy. Or that’s the Indian company’s version of events, according to its May 2 filing.
But those nuances are irrelevant for Go First creditors: Regardless of whether the airline was incompetent, undercapitalized or unlucky, its shareholders must pay a price before the lenders and lessors are asked to make sacrifices.
That’s where India has been a disappointment. In only 6% of instances, debtors trigger bankruptcies. And the recovery rate for creditors in such cases that ultimately do get resolved is just 18%. Lenders are far more comfortable when they themselves drag firms to the insolvency tribunal. Although still low by global standards, the recovery rate in resolutions initiated by financial creditors is almost twice at high at 34%, according to India Ratings & Research, a unit of Fitch Group. Two years ago, this figure was 45%.
What will be the fate of Go First? Air travel has come back as suddenly as it was halted by Covid-19, and Pratt & Whitney has a queue of customers to service. But assuming that the engine-maker would eventually get around to delivering 10 spares a month to Go First until December, as it has been directed to do by the Singapore arbitrator, this airline can fly again.
But it should return as an operation that can sustain its debt, leases, salaries — and delays in fleet repair. One solution may be to leave the corporate structure of Go Airlines behind with a chunk of the 115 billion rupees owed to financial and operations creditors that is now unsustainable, and all of its equity. This is the part that can die. After that, the creditors can invite bids from anyone who wants to inject fresh capital into a new avatar of Go First. If the next owner happens to be Wadia, that’s fine. If it’s not, that’s good, too.
Go First has so far been current with repayments to banks, and has only recently defaulted to lessors and operational creditors. Had any of its debt been nonperforming for a year before the resolution plan kicked in, the
Wadia
Group would have been ruled out as a prospective bidder.
That is just faux puritanism. A practical bankruptcy code will be agnostic about “promoters,” as the controlling shareholders are known in India. Give them back their insolvent firms if they so badly want them, but close out the options for gaming the outcomes, such as by forcing lenders to accept lowball out-of-court settlements: Let them take haircuts, stand in line with everyone else and bid.
Leaving planes with a borrower that isn’t selling flight tickets isn’t ideal. It will jack up leasing rates even for those that are. Still, the tribunal’s intervention may be worth it. Consumers will pay a lot more if
InterGlobe Aviation Ltd
.’s Indigo and the three Tata airlines end up as the only viable options for domestic air travel. After all, Go First isn’t the only one in trouble.
SpiceJet Ltd
., a carrier with a similar market share, has seen its stock lose half its value over the past year. The lessor Aircastle (Ireland) Ltd. is trying to push it into insolvency. That case will be heard May 25.
The promoters have been the driving force of Indian
capitalism
for far too long to just walk away because of a bankruptcy law. (HMS Minden, on which the Star-Spangled Banner was composed, was made in a Wadia shipyard for the British navy.) Yet, the exceptionalism that business families take as their right must end.
There is a difference between protecting the capital in a business, and saving the capitalist behind it. After some initial successes, Modi’s bankruptcy reform has often been unable to find that fine line. It’s up to the court to show that this time will be different.

Given the comfortable timelines of exchange and clear messaging from the government, the macro impact would be ephemeral and marginal, they further highlighted.

Bhardwaj noted that the withdrawal is unlikely to change patterns of spending in the long run.
""Discretionary spending especially in urban India on some durables and services could see a spurt, in a bid to utilise the stock of ₹2,000 notes. Gold, small appliances, home furnishing, mobile phones, membership services of salons, gyms could receive a shot in the arm,"" said

Singhal did caution that construction activity could slow down, but an ""outsized impact"" on any of the sectors was unlikely.

Anil Gupta, senior vice-president, co group head, financial sector ratings,
ICRA
, believes that there may be long-term benefits of the move. ""Over a longer term, the sectors with large-ticket cash-based transactions could see more transparency as it could become difficult to deal in large volumes of cash in smaller denominations, which will be overall beneficial for the economy by way of higher tax collections and better compliances,"" he pointed. But Gupta highlighted that the decision could adversely impact the sectors relying heavily on the cash transactions like real estate markets.
""A slowdown in the real-estate market could have a second order impact on other sectors linked to the real estate sector, however this impact is going to be transitory,"" he added. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist,
Bank of Baroda
also noted that there may be a temporary disruption for cash-incentive activities like elections, real-estate, social functions like marriages, but overall the move is not expected to have any impact on the economy.
Elections to 5 states are scheduled for the end of 2023. There could be some adverse impact on small businesses, which hold high-denomination notes for managing daily transactions, according to
Nomura
's India Economist, Aurodeep Nandi.

"Clarity needed on TCS levy on credit card payments, distinction between biz/personal visits: Tax experts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/clarity-needed-on-tcs-levy-on-credit-card-payments-distinction-between-biz/personal-visits-tax-experts/articleshow/100426189.cms,22-05-2023,"Tax experts on Monday sought clarity on the applicability of
TCS
on foreign payments of over Rs 7 lakh made via credit cards, saying it would be difficult for the I-T department to differentiate between personal and business visits. The government on May 16 issued a notification under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), which effectively imposed a 20 per cent TCS on international credit cards (ICC) spends in foreign exchange. ICC spending was brought under the RBI's liberalised remittance scheme (
LRS
).
However, expenses incurred by an employee on a business visit when such expenses are borne by the employer, do not come under LRS and hence were exempt from 20 per cent Tax Collected at Source (TCS).
Amid backlash from various sections of people, the government on May 19 decided to exempt ICC payments up to Rs 7 lakh a year from TCS.
Experts, however, feel still there are grey areas which are needed to be addressed by the Income Tax department.
Nangia Andersen India, Partner, Neeraj Agarwala said one of the major challenges of the applicability of TCS on international credit card usage is that of compliance.

""In this case, banks issuing credit cards will be responsible for collecting 20 per cent TCS from July 1. This may be difficult for banks to track, and they may have to rely on declarations by the credit card users themselves as to the nature of the payment. They will also have to build an IT system to verify particulars of payment, capture this data and ensure compliance in a timely manner,"" Agarwala said.
He further said prima facie, it would be difficult for the I-T dept to differentiate between business and personal overseas visits and the onus will be on the user to establish the particulars of payment.
EY India, National Tax Leader,
Sameer Gupta
said since the object of the increase in TCS rate on LRS transactions is to address cases of disproportionate remittances as compared to disclosed incomes, a nuanced course would have been to apply a higher TCS rate to non-filers rather than across the board to all remitters.
""The cash flow issue for salaried employees needs to be addressed - the employers should be permitted to adjust the salary
TDS
with the amount of TCS paid by the employee.
""Also, while the Government has clarified that foreign business visits by employees are not covered by LRS, the operational mechanics of distinguishing between official and personal expenditure on international credit/debit cards need clarity,"" Gupta added.
Grant Thornton Bharat, Partner, Tax Riaz
Thingna
said a holistic reading of the changes raises a couple of questions.
""The deletion of the exception for credit card payments under current account regulations means that it will still be difficult for those on a business trip to use international credit cards for business expenses as they may be included within the employee's LRS limit,"" Thingna added.

Governor Shaktikanta Das pushes for stronger governance at public sector banks,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-pushes-for-stronger-bank-boards-greater-focus-on-risk-sources/articleshow/100425256.cms,23-05-2023,"Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday exhorted banks to further strengthen governance and assurance functions and acknowledged the role played by the banks in supporting the economy and maintaining resilience.
Das met the board of directors of all public sector banks in New Delhi to discuss issues related to leadership and governance, and drive
growth
and sustainability. In a statement, the RBI said the governor acknowledged the role played by the banks in supporting the economy and maintaining resilience along with improved financial performance in the face of several adverse shocks in recent times.
The RBI governor exhorted the directors of banks to further strengthen the governance and assurance functions (
risk
management, compliance and internal audit) so that the banks are able to identify and mitigate risks at an early stage, the statement noted, adding that Das also emphasized the need for banks to ensure continued financial and operational resilience.
A senior executive said that
bank
and RBI officials had discussion on various issues such as governance and assurance, credit risk, operational risk, including know your customer (KYC) norms and data analytics.
""There was an open house at the end where other aspects of governance in the banks were also discussed,"" he said.
Live Events
In this year's budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed corporate governance reforms in the banking sector, which will require amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, the Banking Companies Act, and the Reserve Bank of
India
Act to improve bank governance and enhance investors’ protection.

"RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das terms return of Rs 1,000 notes ""speculative""",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-terms-return-of-rs-1000-notes-speculative/articleshow/100415654.cms,22-05-2023,"At a May 22 press briefing, Governor
Shaktikanta Das
was asked if the
RBI
had any plans to bring the Rs 1,000 currency note back to mitigate the impact of the govt's recent move to withdraw the Rs 2,000 note.
In response, Das said the RBI did not have any plan to reintroduce the Rs 1,000 bank notes. The Governor termed any such report ""speculative"".
The Rs 1,000 note, along with the then Rs 500 note, had lost its legal tender status during the 2016 demonetisation.
Today's briefing was the
RBI Governor
's first official interaction with the press since the sudden announcement about the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 notes from circulation.
Das said that the Rs 2,000 notes have long fulfilled their objective of remonetising the system in the wake of demonetisation. Printing of these notes was also brought to a halt in 2018-19, he noted.

Das said there was no need for anyone to hurry to return or exchange the Rs 2,000 notes in their possession. ""There is no reason to rush to banks. You have four months, till September 30,"" the Governor said.
Banks have already been instructed to facilitate the note exchange/return process by providing ""appropriate infrastructure at the branches such as shaded waiting space, drinking water facilities, etc. considering the summer season,” RBI said in a notification.
It is worth recalling here that that during the 2016 demonetisation, huge queues had formed at banks as people rushed to have their old currency notes deposited.
There were even news of people dying while waiting in queues.

"Withdrawal of Rs 2,000 notes unlikely to hit money supply: Top finance ministry Officials",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/voiding-rs-2000-note-unlikely-to-hit-money-supply-officials/articleshow/100402200.cms,22-05-2023,"New Delhi:
The decision to phase out ₹2,000 denomination notes from the system won't have any significant impact on the money supply or financial transactions, finance ministry mandarins told ET, allaying concerns about any fall out on the Indian economy or rural population. Most of these high-value notes, printed after the 2016 demonetisation, are not in circulation any more, the officials reasoned.
Finance secretary
TV Somanathan
said: ""There is adequate supply of smaller-denomination notes in the economy to substitute for the ₹2,000 notes. I don't see any impact whatsoever on the economy.""
Economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth said it is only an exchange of notes of one denomination for smaller denominations. ""Money supply to the economy will remain unaffected. The currency (the ₹2,000 note) continues to be a legal tender"".
Chief economic adviser (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran said: ""The circulation of the ₹2,000 notes is really small now. The
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) had stopped printing these notes in FY19."" He added that then finance minister Arun Jaitley had also said in 2016 that these notes should be eventually phased out.
The current withdrawal ""won't be economically significant at all"", the CEA concluded.
Live Events
As part of its 'clean note policy', the RBI on Friday declared the gradual withdrawal of ₹2,000 notes from circulation, stating that it has served its purpose. The central bank has encouraged people to get these notes exchanged from banks by September 30.
'No impact on farm procurement'
Somanathan asserted that the move won't, in any way, hit farm commodity purchases during the ongoing rabi harvest season that could hurt the rural population.
Usually, the rabi harvest is mostly over by June. ""The government has taken due care to ensure that there is no disruption,"" he added.
""People can continue to use the ₹2,000 notes for now and the rabi harvest will be over well before September 30,"" the finance secretary said. Moreover, most of the high-value notes would be concentrated in urban areas, ""so the phase-out won't hit rural areas"", he added.
People can continue to accept such notes, deposit them in their banks and exchange them with smaller denomination notes by September 30 without any restrictions,
Somanathan
explained.
'This is no demonetisation'
The top officials rejected claims that people are going to experience the 2016 demonetisation pains again, reiterating that ₹2,000 notes continue to be a legal tender.
Economic affairs secretary Seth said: ""It is not demonetisation that would require remonetisation"". The ₹2,000 note is withdrawn and equal value notes of other denominations would be given back, he said. ""If someone deposits the high-value notes in his/ her bank account, the withdrawal can be done as required. Sufficient currency notes of other denominations are available.""

""The board approved the transfer of ₹87,416 crore as surplus to the central government for the accounting year 2022-23, while deciding to keep the contingency risk buffer at 6%,"" the

The budget had estimated receipts worth ₹48,000 crore by way of total dividends from public sector banks and the RBI.

The higher payout was enabled by increased earnings on sale of forex during the year.
Higher Interest Income
Better returns on forex investments in US treasuries (though the value of bonds would have fallen, which has to be charged to the contingency reserve), revaluation of forex assets and adjustments in reserves as per the Bimal Jalan committee recommendations also helped.
The average historical cost of dollar purchases is estimated at around Rs 63 a unit. But the market price at which RBI sold dollars averaged Rs 80 during the year. The RBI had earned Rs 68,990 crore in FY22 out of its foreign exchange transactions involving gross dollar purchases of $96 billion.
The central bank sold a gross $206 billion during the April-February period of FY23, up from $96 billion in the previous fiscal.
Lending to banks under various windows may have earned the RBI higher interest income as the benchmark repo rate against which it lends to banks had climbed 2.5 percentage points during the year.
The central bank's revised accounting framework stipulates that the accounting practice of forex operations be linked to historical costs against the earlier practice of week-to-week costs.

In March, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the listing of IREDA to shed a part of the government's stake and to raise funds for IREDA through the issue of fresh equity shares.
The government expects the IPO to help unlock the value of its investment and help IREDA raise a part of its capital requirement for growth plans without depending on the public exchequer. Moreover, the move is expected to ""improve governance through greater market discipline and transparency arising from listing requirements and disclosures"", according to an official statement after the CCEA decision in March.
Last year, the government infused ₹1,500 crore capital into IREDA to improve its net-worth and bolster its capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio to spur lending for renewable projects. As of end-March, the company's net-worth hit ₹5,935 crore, up 13% from ₹5,268 crore a year earlier.
IREDA, a mini ratna (category I) central public-sector enterprise, finances renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in India. It is registered as a non-banking financial company.
The company's performance improved meaningfully last fiscal year. According to the official data, IREDA's profit after tax jumped 36% on year in FY23 to Rs 865 crore. Its loan sanctions surged 36% to Rs 32,587 crore in FY23, while disbursements jumped 35% to Rs 21,639 crore.
Its loan book swelled 39% to Rs 47,076 crore as of March 2023 from a year earlier, and net non-performing assets moderated to 1.66% from 3.12%.

"India's forex reserves soar to $599.53 bln, highest since early June",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-forex-reserves-soar-to-599-53-bln-highest-since-early-june/articleshow/100358232.cms,19-05-2023,"India's
foreign exchange reserves
experienced a continuous increase for the third week in a row, reaching $599.53 billion as of May 12. This level represents the highest amount since early June, according to the
Reserve Bank of India
's statistical supplement released on Friday. The reserves saw a rise of $3.55 billion compared to the previous week, following a total increase of $11.7 billion over the preceding two weeks.
To prevent significant fluctuations in the rupee, the central
bank
intervenes in both the spot and forwards markets. The changes in foreign exchange reserves can also be influenced by gains or losses in valuation.
According to a Reuters report, several foreign banks that hold a bullish outlook on the rupee are being challenged by the Reserve Bank of India's ongoing intervention efforts to bolster its reserves.
During the week corresponding to the forex reserves data, the rupee experienced a decline of 0.4%, primarily influenced by the overall strength of the dollar index. Throughout the week, the rupee traded within the range of 81.6900 to 82.2250 against the dollar.

"Reserve Bank of India to transfer Rs 87,416 crore as dividend to Centre for FY23",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-approves-transfer-of-rs-87416-crore-as-surplus-to-the-central-government/articleshow/100355569.cms,19-05-2023,"The
Reserve Bank
of India's board Friday approved the transfer of Rs 87,416 crore as surplus to the
Central government
. It also decided to raise the contingency risk buffer to 6% from 5.5%, the central bank said in a press release.
In FY22, the
RBI
transferred Rs 30,307 crore to the government.
""The Board in its meeting reviewed the global and domestic economic situation and associated challenges including the impact of current global geopolitical developments,"" RBI's release said.
The Shaktikanta Das-led board discussed the working of the Reserve Bank during the year April 2022 – March 2023 and approved the Annual Report and accounts of the Reserve Bank for the accounting year 2022-23.
India's benchmark 10-year bond yield, however, jumped 5 basis points to 7.01% as market participants had priced in a surplus transfer of Rs 1 - 1.5 lakh crore.
Live Events
ET earlier in May had reported that the central government is likely to make windfall gains by way of annual
dividend
receipts from the RBI, which is estimated to have garnered substantial profits in foreign-currency trading and by lending to the local banking system after the rise in policy rates and liquidity drainage prompted high-street lenders to borrow more from the RBI.
The Budget has estimated receipts of ₹48,000 crore in FY24 by way of total dividends from public sector banks and the RBI.
In the previous financial year, the government aimed to garner Rs 40,953 crore from RBI and public sector financial institutions, much lower compared to the Budget Estimate of Rs 73,948 crore for FY23.
As per the Budget document, dividends from public sector enterprises and other investments have been pegged at Rs 43,000 crore for FY24 as well.
As per the Revised Estimate for FY23, the dividend from public sector enterprises and other investments was higher at Rs 43,000 crore from the Budget Estimate of Rs 40,000 crore.

"RBI dividends to Modi’s government may double, aiding fiscal gap",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-dividends-to-modis-government-may-double-aiding-fiscal-gap/articleshow/100343519.cms,19-05-2023,"The
Reserve Bank of India
board may decide to nearly double its
dividend
to the government from official estimates due to revaluation gains and profits from selling dollars, which could help bridge the
fiscal deficit
.
A Bloomberg survey of nine economists saw the surplus transfer at 900 billion rupees ($10.9 billion) for the year ended March, compared to the government’s own estimate of 480 billion rupees, which includes dividends from state-controlled banks. Last year, the
RBI
approved a payout of 303.1 billion rupees, the lowest in a decade.
The RBI board is set to meet on Friday as early signs of slowing growth emerge with elevated interest rates and falling global demand. A higher dividend payout will help Prime Minister Narendra
Modi
’s government to meet its target of lowering the fiscal deficit to 5.9% of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year from 6.4% a year ago and shore up revenues ahead of the 2024 national vote.
Bloomberg
The government is expecting the RBI to transfer a significantly higher dividend, which will help reduce its market borrowing, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on Thursday.

Stubborn cash squeeze risks derailing India’s economic recovery
“Gains from the near record gross
foreign exchange sales
in fiscal year 2022-23 would be the major driver of higher surplus,” said Madhavi Arora, economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. The dividend could bring in additional revenue of 0.2% of GDP, which could partly offset losses in bonds and cover for lower tax revenue and slower divestment, she said.
The RBI makes an annual payout to the government from the surplus income earned from investments and valuation changes on its foreign exchange holdings, including the dollar, and the fees it gets from printing currency notes. It is mandated to maintain a contingency risk buffer of within 5.5% to 6.5% of its balance sheet.
Economists polled by Bloomberg expect the dividend to range between 525 billion rupees to 1.65 trillion rupees. The highest estimate surpasses the central bank’s record 1.23 trillion dividend transfer for the year 2018-19.
The RBI embarked on massive dollar sales likely for currency intervention in the last fiscal year with data showing $206.4 billion of the currency sold in 11 months to February. This compares with $96.7 billion in the whole of the fiscal year 2021-22.

The RBI probably acquired the greenback at around 62.7 rupees per dollar in the last fiscal year, and sold it around 81-82 rupee level, earning as much as 690 billion rupees from foreign exchange transactions, according to Gaura Sen Gupta, an economist at
IDFC First Bank
.
Since the central bank denominates its balance sheet in rupees, a stronger dollar results in a revaluation gain that can also be tapped to boost the transfer, she added.
The RBI’s balance sheet probably expanded about 2% in the last fiscal year, the slowest since 2016-17’s demonetization exercise, and compares with 9% expansion a year before, according to Arora, as abundant liquidity in the system limited the need for bond purchases from the markets.
However, rising interest rates globally likely lowered the value of foreign bonds held by the RBI, leading to nominal losses dragging down the earnings, said Abhishek Upadhyay, an economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd.

“Given there is no buffer left in the interest rate revaluation account for foreign securities, this loss will need to be charged directly to contingency reserves that is part of RBI realized equity,” Upadhyay said.
Other economists cautioned against a higher dividend payout as India’s foreign exchange reserves have stayed below $600 billion for the past 13 months though portfolio inflows and currency appreciation against the dollar are supporting the case.
“The moot point would be to gauge whether RBI draws comfort from distributing higher dividend purely out of revaluation reserves owing to rupee weakness or shows prudence at a time when in reality foreign exchange reserve kitty has declined over the year,” said Siddharth Kothari, an economist with Sunidhi Consultancy Services.

High Court seeks Centre's response on plea asking banks to pay interest on FASTag collected money,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/high-court-seeks-centres-response-on-plea-asking-banks-to-pay-interest-on-fastag-collected-money/articleshow/100335786.cms,18-05-2023,"The Delhi
High Court
has sought response of the
NHAI
and the Centre on a plea seeking to direct banks to pay interest to the authorities on the money collected by them with the issue of
FASTag
and minimum balance requirement on the card. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad issued notices to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRT&H) on an application which pleads that with the issuing of FASTag, thousands of crores of rupees have entered the banking system without any corresponding benefit either to the commuter community or to NHAI or MoRT&H.
The court granted four weeks time to the authorities to file their replies to the application and listed the matter for further hearing on August 10.
The application was filed in a pending petition that challenges a rule which compels vehicles without FASTag to pay double the toll tax. The petition contended that the rule was discriminatory, arbitrary, and against public interest as it empowers the NHAI to collect toll at double the rate, if paid in cash.
Petitioner Ravinder Tyagi, represented by advocate Praveen Agrawal, said in the application that a sum of more than Rs 30,000 crore has entered the banking system with introduction of FASTag facility.
The plea contended even if the
Fixed Deposit rate
of 8.25 per cent per annum is applied to this figure, every year NHAI or MoRT&H will gain over Rs 2,000 crore.

""At present this money is being utilised by the banks / financial Institutions free of cost and at the cost of the respondents (NHAI and MoRT&H). The interest of this money belongs to either the NHAI / MoRTH or commuters and deserves to be spent in the further development of road / highways / commuters benefits,"" it said.
The application also sought to direct the authorities to create a separate fund in the name of 'Commuters Welfare Fund' from the income received from interest of FASTag.
FASTag is a device that employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for making toll payments directly while the vehicle is in motion. FASTag is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables a customer to make the toll payments directly from the account which is linked to it.
The high court had earlier issued a notice and sought response of the Centre and NHAI on the main petition which sought quashing of a provision of the National Highway Fees (Determination of Rates and Collection) Amendment Rules, 2020 due to which commuters without a FASTag on their vehicles are bound to pay double the toll tax.
The plea said these rules and the circular convert all toll lanes to 100 per cent FASTag lanes with the consequence that commuters without a functional FASTag are compelled to pay double the toll amount.
The petitioner, a lawyer, claimed he was compelled to install a FASTag device in his car because of the compulsion of paying double the toll in cash.
He said before installing the FASTag he used to pay double toll.

The demerger of SCILAL was approved by the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs
in February this year and the process was completed in March.
In 2019, the government had announced its intent to privatise SCI but the plan was delayed over issues such as the transfer of funds to the demerged entity.
Based on the current stock market price, the government would rake in over ₹2,850 crore for its 63.75% stake in SCI.
The SCI share price eased 0.6% to close at ₹96.04 on the BSE on Wednesday.
The government is now focusing on disinvestment of companies that have already been identified, including
IDBI Bank
, SCI,
NMDC Steel
, and
IREDA
, before adding other potential candidates to the list, officials said.
It has set a disinvestment target at ₹51,000 crore for the current fiscal year, slightly higher than the revised estimate of ₹50,000 crore but lower than the budgeted estimate of ₹65,000 crore for FY23.

Stubborn cash squeeze risks derailing India’s economic recovery,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/stubborn-cash-squeeze-risks-derailing-indias-economic-recovery/articleshow/100292795.cms,17-05-2023,"A cash crunch is persisting in
India
, pushing short-term borrowing costs above a key policy interest rate and posing risks to an economy that needs cheaper funding to sustain its
recovery
.
After a surge in recent weeks, the weighted average call rate which Reserve Bank of India closely monitors, has shot above its policy rate ceiling of 6.75%. Yields on one-year
treasury bills
also have exceeded those on 10-year government debt, an anomaly often associated with a malfunctioning bond market.
The funding squeeze indicates a clogged-up financial system that is starting to hurt appetite for bonds and further raising financing costs just as the RBI has paused monetary tightening amid easing price pressures. But economists say the situation may linger for a while, with the central bank still determined to fight
inflation
and expected to offer short-term liquidity relief only.
Bloomberg
“With the rate-hiking cycle behind us, liquidity management will now be the key focus of monetary policy,” said Gaura Sen Gupta, economist at
IDFC First Bank Ltd
. “As long as the stance of monetary policy remains as withdrawal of accommodation, liquidity conditions are likely to remain tight.”
A gauge measuring excess cash that lenders park with the RBI has dropped to 484 billion rupees ($5.9 billion) from a high of 9 trillion rupees in 2022, as the central bank delivered a series of rate hikes and drained liquidity to tackle inflation.

While the latest funding squeeze mainly resulted from the RBI’s policy tightening, a buildup in the government’s cash surplus and uneven liquidity distribution among banks have made matters worse, said Gaurav Kapur, chief economist at
IndusInd Bank Ltd
.
The bond market is already feeling the pinch, with yields on six-month commercial paper of non-banking finance companies having risen 10 basis points this month. A Friday auction of sovereign bonds saw muted demand, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.6 times, according to
ICICI Bank
.
The spike in the overnight rate reflects asymmetrical distribution of funds between bigger and smaller banks, which fuels volatility in the money market and contributes to less efficient credit allocation, according to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief
economic
advisor at
State Bank of India
.
If the
cash squeeze
keeps worsening, it may pose risks to an economy that has delivered stellar growth since the pandemic but now faces headwinds from slowing global demand to a heat wave that threatens the nation’s thriving farm sector.
“High rates reflect tightening liquidity and clouded financing conditions for firms with weaker credit profile,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, director at India Ratings and Research Pvt. “Such firms may find it difficult to survive sustained tight financing conditions, leading to clustered credit events. Inter-linkages may also trigger contagion, potentially impacting the larger economy.”
Bloomberg
But for now, economists say the RBI will likely refrain from using potent liquidity injection tools to push rates down sharply, as it may want to keep borrowing costs relatively elevated to rein in inflation and provide a buffer for the local currency.
The central bank is expected to initially rely on longer-dated variable bond repurchase agreements and foreign exchange intervention to ease the funding squeeze, said IDFC’s Sen Gupta, adding that an expected large dividend payout by the RBI to the government will also help offer more liquidity.
“As far as injection of permanent liquidity is concerned, we think RBI will not attempt to do so as long as policy stance doesn’t move to neutral,” ICICI Securities Primary Dealership economists including A. Prasanna wrote in a note, referring to options including RBI’s open-market bond purchases and lowering banks’ reserve requirements.

Russian companies investing rupee surplus in Indian government bonds: IBA chief,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/russian-companies-investing-rupee-surplus-in-indian-government-bonds-iba-chief/articleshow/100275673.cms,16-05-2023,"Russian banks and companies who have trade surpluses with Indian lenders are using those rupee funds to invest in domestic government debt, the head of the Indian Banks' Association (
IBA
) said on Tuesday.
Investments by Russian banks and companies in
Indian government bonds
underline challenges in converting rupees into roubles, which has hampered attempts to widen non-dollar denominated trade between the two nations.
IBA chief
Sunil Mehta
is the first senior official to confirm that Russian funds in Indian banks were being invested into government securities as it gives them the advantage of easy liquidity.
""They have surplus of money. They have invested (in local bonds).
RBI
has opened the window that whatever trade surplus they have, you can invest in government bonds,"" Mehta said.
The move comes after the
Reserve Bank of India
last year outlined norms for international trade settlements in rupees, while also allowing any
rupee surplus
balance held locally to be invested in government bonds and treasury bills.

Reserve Bank of India expected to consider dividend payout this week,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/reserve-bank-of-india-expected-to-consider-dividend-payout-this-week/articleshow/100268793.cms,16-05-2023,"The Reserve Bank of India's board is expected board to meet on Friday when it is expected to consider a
dividend
payout to the government, news agency Bloomberg reported on Tuesday citing sources.
The report said that the meeting will be held in Mumbai wherein it might review its finances and how much it can transfer to the government during its May board meeting.
For FY22, the central bank transferred a surplus of ₹30,307 crore to the Centre.
ET earlier in May had reported that the central government is likely to make
windfall gains
by way of annual dividend receipts from the
RBI
, which is estimated to have garnered substantial profits in foreign-currency trading and by lending to the local banking system after the rise in policy rates and
liquidity
drainage prompted high-street lenders to borrow more from the RBI.
The
Budget
has estimated receipts of ₹48,000 crore in FY24 by way of total dividends from public sector banks and the RBI.

""Given the large levels of dollar sales and low provisioning requirements, the

is expected to exceed Budget estimates,"" Gaura Sengupta, India economist,

collections, from slower-than-budgeted nominal GDP growth.""
In the previous financial year, the government aimed to garner Rs 40,953 crore from RBI and public sector financial institutions, much lower compared to the
Budget Estimate of Rs

As per the Budget document, dividends from public sector enterprises and other investments have been pegged at Rs 43,000 crore for FY24 as well.
As per the Revised Estimate for FY23, the dividend from public sector enterprises and other investments was higher at Rs 43,000 crore from the Budget Estimate of Rs 40,000 crore.

"Poll freebies to hurt long-term growth, say experts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/poll-freebies-to-hurt-long-term-growth-say-experts/articleshow/100236680.cms,15-05-2023,"The freebies promised by the
Congress party
that swept the Karnataka polls could spur competitive populism in the build-up to the 2024 general election, experts said, warning reckless giveaways would hurt long-term growth and development prospects.
They acknowledged a certain amount of populism is inevitable as well as desirable in a democracy for redistribution, but that should not undermine fiscal prudence and compromise efficiency in government spending.
C
Rangarajan
, former central bank governor, told ET that fiscal deficit limits, especially those relating to states, need to be strictly enforced to curb the so-called “freebie” culture. “It would be very difficult to tell politicians what to do and what not to. They will say it’s their privilege. But at the same time, if the fiscal deficit rules are enforced strictly, I think we can find a way by which these measures (freebies) can be kept under control,” he said.
“That’s the necessary thing to do because you can’t be relaxed on both counts—allowing them to provide many facilities and also easing fiscal deficit rules,” Rangarajan added.
States are currently allowed a fiscal deficit of 3.5% of their gross domestic product, of which 0.5% is tied to certain reforms.

In a first, value of government freebies to be computed
The Congress party has promised every female head of the family Rs 2,000 a month, every unemployed diploma holder Rs 1,500 per month, and graduates Rs 3,000 a month.
According to the party's pre-poll promises, women would also get to travel for free in the buses run by the state government. Also, every family would be provided 200 units of power for free.
Some calculations suggest the cash payments and power subsidy alone would cost Rs 62,000 crore a year.
'ET intervention needed'
Pronab Sen, former chairman of the
National Statistical Commission
, said while electoral promises are rising, much will also depend on whether people believe such pledges will translate into reality.
Sen called for action by the
Election Commission
(EC) to control freebie announcements ahead of polls. “The EC has to stipulate that certain things can be done (by political parties) and certain things can’t be done. These will have to be built into the election rules,” Sen said.
M Govinda Rao, a member of the 14th Finance Commission, sees the freebie culture continuing as political parties remain more focused on short-term rather than long-term benefits.
“The governments haven’t adequately empowered people and created enough jobs for them, because then people wouldn’t need these freebies,” he said, adding that this has created some justification for electoral giveaways.
""The redistribution (of resources) is an obvious function of the government because markets don’t do redistribution, but it’s better to do it through direct cash transfers rather than through other means,” Rao said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has warned against what he calls “revdi (freebie)” culture for seeking votes, terming it “very dangerous” for the country's development.
NR Bhanumurthy
, vice chancellor at Bengaluru’s BASE University, said the reasons for a rise in freebies extended by states also include the fact that states are getting a larger share of the divisible pool of taxes (after the 14th Finance Commission grants) than earlier.
Moreover, when they find it difficult to identify clear projects for investments, “they look for a space where they can benefit more in terms of political economy, and that too, easily"", he said. ""What needs to be kept in mind is how efficiently these schemes are going to be implemented and how far they are sustainable,” Bhanumurthy added.
Old pension scheme
Experts called the decision of some states to go back to the old pension scheme (OPS), in an attempt to woo government servants, a bad move.
Rangarajan said if states want to adopt the OPS again, “we have to rethink how the pension amount is determined”.
“Even though we have moved to the
New Pension System
, which is the right thing to do, one can guarantee a certain minimum pension there, but the guaranteed pension shouldn’t be fixed at a high level as it was under the OPS,” Rangarajan said.
Under the OPS, retired government employees got 50% of their last-drawn salary as a monthly pension. The amount keeps rising with hikes in the dearness allowance rates and is periodically revised by the pay commissions.
The Reserve Bank of India had in January cautioned against bringing back the OPS that was in place until 2004, stating that such a move would exacerbate the fiscal burden of the states in the coming years.
Sen said the argument for adopting the OPS now has become “much weaker”. “Earlier, government servants were underpaid, and one of the reasons the government could get away with it was because of the pension scheme,” he said, adding that when the pay commissions sharply hiked the salary of government staff, they probably took into account the relaxed pension burden.
“So, now bringing the OPS back may amount to overpayment. But prior to (the sharp pay panel salary hike), the pension scheme was warranted,” Sen added.
Rao said reintroducing the OPS ""is a bad thing to do and ultimately, money has to come from the tax-payer"".
Five states — Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh — have informed the Centre about their decision to go back to the OPS. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis recently said the state government was not ""entirely negative"" on the OPS. Fadnavis, however, added that any such decision would have to be made after factoring in the state's finances.

A new APY account can be opened by any Indian citizen, in the age group of 18-40 years, who is having a savings bank account and who is not an income taxpayer.
Under APY, a subscriber would receive a lifelong minimum guaranteed pension of Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 per month from the age of 60 years, depending on his/her contribution.
The same pension would be paid to the spouse of the subscriber after the demise of the subscriber. On the demise of both the subscriber and spouse, the

India funding costs surge to one-month high on cash squeeze,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-funding-costs-surge-to-one-month-high-on-cash-squeeze/articleshow/100159612.cms,11-05-2023,"Overnight
funding costs
in
India
have surged above the central bank’s
policy rate
, a sign that the excess
cash
in the
banking system
has dried up.
The weighted average call rate, an overnight funding cost rate that the central bank monitors, have climbed almost 30 basis points since the start of the year. At 6.78% on Wednesday, it’s just hovering above the upper band of the Reserve Bank of India’s interest-rate corridor of 6.75%.
The excess cash that banks park with the
RBI
has dwindled to 788 billion rupees ($9.6 billion), from as high as 9 trillion rupees in 2022, as the central bank delivered a series of rate hikes to tackle inflation. For money managers, the tightness makes shorter papers like treasury bills and liquid funds more attractive.
Bloomberg
The higher overnight rate is almost equivalent to a rate hike, even though the RBI paused in the April policy, according to Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG. That may mean there is no justification for more hikes with the April inflation print also likely to sharply ease, Das said.
Bandhan Asset Management Ltd. says treasury bill rates have risen to attractive levels while Quantum Asset Management Ltd. is advising shorter-term investors to buy liquid funds.

However, the liquidity crunch may ease soon as the central bank’s dollar purchases in the forex market is adding cash and its dividend payment to the government is due.
“The current liquidity tightness phase is being driven by diminishing core liquidity unlike previous recent episodes which were more owing to higher government cash balances,” said Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at Bandhan Asset Management. “Thus this requires more permanent solutions and cannot be termed as ‘frictional.”

Indian economy benefited from diaspora: RBI's Michael Patra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indian-economy-benefited-from-diaspora-rbis-michael-patra/articleshow/100140191.cms,10-05-2023,"The
Indian diaspora
contributed substantially to the country's forex reserves pile-up. In addition to sending record amounts- $108 billion - as remittances to their families back home, cumulative NRI deposits are at $136 billion as of February 2023, according to a top
RBI
official.
""The
Indian economy
has been a beneficiary of this dynamic and industrious diaspora. India currently receives the highest flow of remittances in the world at $ 108 billion in 2022, up by 24.6 per cent from a year ago, and accounting for 3 per cent of India’s GDP"" RBI deputy governor
Michael Patra
said in his address at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR) Alumni Conference, Mumbai. ""Additionally, Indians residing abroad hold deposits in Indian banks cumulating to $ 136 billion at the end of February 2023"". The country's foreign exchange reserves are at $588 billion as of April 28, 2023.
Undescording the contribution of the diaspora, Patra noted that over the years, India's perceptions about the
diaspora
have also transformed from ‘brain drain’ to ‘brain gain’, spurred by the contributions that Indians have made in various fields in the global arena, including information technology, entrepreneurship, international politics, medicine, arts and culture, with some of them becoming Nobel laureates.
An outward reflection of India’s demographic bonus is the vibrant expansion of Indian communities across the world. "" India has always been an open economy and international migration has been a major force defining India’s economic, social and political relations with the rest of the world right from the Bronze Age in 3000 BC "" Patra said.
Besides, the Indian economy is undergoing a quiet but fundamental transformation encompassing all its sectors. ""Perhaps the most striking transformation is occurring in India’s exports of services which have demonstrated pandemic-proofing, rising by above 25 per cent per annum since 2020, and providing valuable support to the viability of the external sector"" Patra said.

India is home to about 40 per cent of world's Global Capacity Centres, and they are estimated to comprise 25 per cent of overall IT services exports, according to Patra. GCCs are also driving diversification, with firms in diverse sectors such as electronics, retail, automotive, banking and financial services, and hospitality, to name a few, setting up GCCs in India.

Government gives time till May 31 for Goods Transport Agencies to opt for GST payment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/government-gives-time-till-may-31-for-goods-transport-agencies-to-opt-for-gst-payment/articleshow/100122251.cms,10-05-2023,"The government has extended the deadline to May 31 for Goods Transport Agencies to exercise the option of paying
GST
on forward charge basis for current fiscal. Under GST, Goods Transport Agencies have the option to collect and pay GST on forward charge basis. If they do not opt to do so, the liability to pay the tax gets transferred to the recipient of the service, under reverse charge mechanism.
To opt for paying
Goods and Services Tax
(GST) under forward charge basis at the rate of 12 per cent (with input tax credit) and 5 per cent (without
ITC
benefits) in a fiscal,
a Goods Transport Agency
(
GTA
) has to fill a form (Annexure V) by March 15 of the preceding financial year.
In an amendment to the GST Act, the finance ministry in May said ""the option for the Financial Year 2023-2024 (by a GTA) shall be exercised on or before the 31st May"".
Any entity providing service of goods transport by road and issuing a consignment note for the purpose is defined as GTA under GST, which came into effect from July 1, 2017.
The amendment further said that a GTA who commences new business or crosses threshold for registration during any financial year, may exercise the option to itself pay GST on the services supplied by it during that financial year by making a declaration in Annexure V before 45 days from the date of applying for GST registration or one month from the date of obtaining registration, whichever is later.

said GTA has the option to pay tax either on forward charge or reverse charge and both mechanisms have their own pros and cons.
Forward charge permits a taxpayer to use tax credit and pay tax only on the differential value added. Reverse charge would obliviate the need to keep detailed records for payment of taxes and would also free up working capital blocked in taxes, Mohan added.

Larry Summers
. The two co-chair an independent G20 expert group for firming up a road map for an updated eco-system for multilateral development banks (MDBs).
Seeking inputs from experts and other stakeholders on ways to reform the MDBs, they said such banks are uniquely positioned to help countries meet challenges like climate change and food security. But, at the same time, there is a general recognition that they are not fit for the 21st century, they added.
The group has to submit its report by July, so the time for submitting inputs is short, they said.
Singh is the president of the Institute of Economic Growth, while Summers is the president Emeritus of
Harvard University
.
The panel has been set up under
India
's G20 presidency to develop a road map for an updated MDB ecosystem (with milestones and timelines) that includes vision, incentive structure, operational approaches and financial capacity. It would evaluate estimates of the finance scale needed to and from MDBs and propose mechanisms for coordination among MDBs.

"India's forex reserves at comfortable level due to RBI, dollar: Economists",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-forex-reserves-at-comfortable-level-due-to-rbi-dollar-economists/articleshow/100096467.cms,09-05-2023,"India's foreign exchange reserves are at a comfortable level currently, benefiting from the
Reserve Bank of India
's persistent intervention and the likelihood of less volatile revaluation changes, economists said.
India's forex reserves
reached a 10-month-high of $588.8 billion in the week through April 28, recovering from a drop to $524.5 billion last October, when the rupee hit a record low against the U.S.
dollar
.
Since October 2022, the
RBI
has been rebuilding the reserves, taking advantage of the rupee's recovery. The central bank bought more than $8 billion in the spot market in November and December, according to its data.
The RBI has been buying dollars in the forward market too. Its net outstanding forward dollar purchases reached $20.4 billion in February, the latest month for which data is available, after having dwindled to $241 million in October.
Since October, ""comfort on the level of reserves has improved significantly,"" said Gaura Sen Gupta, economist at
IDFC First Bank
.

""Reserves (both spot and forwards) are now equivalent to 10.4 months of import cover, compared with about 8.9% in Oct 2022.""
Moreover, said Vivek Kumar, economist at QuantEco Research, the RBI will continue ""using reserve buildup opportunity to bolster its import cover further"".
In the wake of the RBI's intervention in spot and forwards, the rupee's response to the dollar's decline has been fairly muted.
While the dollar index has lost about 11.5% from its peak in September last year, the rupee has recovered about 1.5% from its record low.
And, given that the RBI will want the rupee ""to remain ranged"", the local currency will continue to somewhat underperform, said Sakshi Gupta, Principal Economist,
HDFC Bank
.
Besides the RBI's intervention, the revaluation changes due to the dollar index's decline since October and the fall in U.S. yields have been major contributors to the increase in reserves.
Now, with the
Federal Reserve
likely to pause its rate-hike cycle and the U.S. dollar's soft outlook, there is expected to be less volatility around revaluation changes, said IDFC's Gaura.
And provides an added layer of comfort as far as the adequacy of forex reserves is concerned.

Briefing reporters about the outcome of the 27th meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Council (

finance
minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Seth said, ""We see that the global financial situation is daunting, but at the same time, the Indian economy and financial sector is well protected and well regulated. But of course, we have to be cautious and be on our toes.""
Asked if the spill over of the collapse of
Silicon Valley Bank
and
Signature Bank
in the US and liquidity pressure faced by Credit Suisse was deliberated on at the meeting, Seth said it was not specifically discussed but insisted ""there's no spill-over coming."" The council also discussed robust ""early warning indicators"" to flag stress, external or internal, and the economy's preparedness to deal with them, he added.

Special drive for unclaimed deposits
In the meeting, Sitharaman called for a special drive to help people get their unclaimed deposits across all financial segments, including bank deposits, shares and dividends, mutual funds, and insurance. The council comprises chiefs of key financial sector regulators, apart from top finance ministry functionaries.
Data showed about ₹35,000 crore of unclaimed deposits in about 102.4 million accounts as of February 2023 were transferred to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by state-run banks alone. These are basically bank deposits that have not been operated for 10 years or more.
Fin stability, compliance burden
The minister advised the council to take appropriate and timely measures to mitigate any vulnerability, given that maintaining financial stability is a shared responsibility of the government and the regulators. She said regulators must adopt a focused approach to reduce the compliance burden further and ensure a streamlined and efficient regulatory environment. The minister will review the progress on this front with each regulator in June 2023.
Sitharaman also called on the regulators to ramp up cyber-security preparedness to protect sensitive financial data and help safeguard the stability and resilience of the financial ecosystem.

windfall gains
by way of annual dividend receipts from the
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI), which is estimated to have garnered substantial profits in foreign-currency trading and by lending to the local banking system after the rise in policy rates and liquidity drainage prompted high-street lenders to borrow more from the
RBI
.
The Budget has estimated receipts of ₹48,000 crore in FY24 by way of total dividends from public sector banks and the RBI.
""Given the large levels of dollar sales and low provisioning requirements, the
RBI dividend
is expected to exceed Budget estimates,"" Gaura Sengupta, India economist,
IDFC First Bank
, said in her recent report. ""We estimate that the dividend from the RBI could range between ₹70,000 crore and ₹80,000 crore. The better-than-expected RBI dividend will balance some of the risks facing tax revenue collections, from slower-than-budgeted nominal GDP growth."" For FY22, the central bank had transferred a surplus of ₹30,307 crore to the Centre.
Combined gains out of foreign currency sales and interest on loans to the local banking system may more than offset the mark-to-market losses on bond portfolios - both local and overseas. The valuation of foreign exchange transactions at historical costs could help the central bank that sold a gross $206 billion during April-Feb of FY23, up from $96 billion in the previous fiscal.
The central bank's revised accounting framework, as recommended by a committee headed by former governor Bimal Jalan and adopted in 2019, stipulates that the accounting practice of forex operations be linked to historical costs against the earlier practice of week-to-week costs.

Average historical cost of dollar purchases is estimated around Rs 63 a unit. But the market price at which RBI sold dollars averaged Rs 80 during the year. The RBI had earned Rs 68,990 crore in FY22 out of its foreign exchange transactions involving gross dollar sales of $96 billion. Hence, the income from selling more than $200 billion could be substantial after adjusting for dollar purchases during the year and other swaps and forward transactions.
""So the total amount of foreign exchange sold against total bought is large, and the RBI is likely to find space to pay dividends from a smaller need for
capital
adequacy and profits made on forex transactions,"" said Rahul Bajoria, Head of EM Asia (ex China), economics research, Barclays Capital.
A higher outgo on dividends could also be due to higher interest rates during the year and the RBI was in a reverse repo mode, according to Madan Sabnavis, chief economist,
Bank of Baroda
.
Interest income on bond holdings and liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), too, is not expected to be significantly higher. But lending to banks under various windows may earn higher interest income as the benchmark repo rates against which it lends to banks have climbed 2.5 percentage points during the year.
Outstanding loans and advances to commercial banks alone are at Rs 1.65 lakh crore - Rs 70,000 crore higher in FY23. In addition, there is an additional Rs 1.11 lakh crore exposure to other entities, or Rs 30,000 higher than in the previous year. This could lead to a sharp surge in interest income from loans and advances for the central bank. In FY22, the RBI had earned Rs 1,500 crore on domestic loans and advances on a portfolio of Rs 1.3 lakh crore.

"Global finance dominated by few currencies, need to de-risk by diversifying, says RBI DG T Sankar",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/global-finance-dominated-by-few-currencies-need-to-de-risk-by-diversifying-says-rbi-dg-t-sankar/articleshow/99996535.cms,05-05-2023,"A handful of currencies currently dominate global
finance
, and there is a need for de-risking by diversifying the international
currency
system by adopting liquid currencies, Reserve
Bank
Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said on Thursday. Speaking at the launch of a hackathon event organised as part of India's G-20 presidency, Sankar also appealed that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) should be adopted more by other countries as well, terming the fiat digital currency as essential for maintaining financial integrity.
It can be noted that India began its efforts to internationalise the rupee last year, under which the effort is to decrease the
reliance
on the USD-dominated trade, by making rupee payments possible. So far, 18 countries have opened rupee accounts.
""We have a global financial system that is dominated in terms of transactions, in terms of invoicing, in terms of their usage for hedging and other purposes by a few handfuls of reserve currencies.
""It would probably, therefore, be in the interest of international currency system to have a little more diversified liquid currencies, which could...have the additional benefit of de-risking the global financial systems, instead of a dependence only a few, depend on more,"" Sankar said.
The right infrastructure and
liquidity
are eminently feasible irrespective of the currency involved, he said, adding that forex pricing can be far more efficient than what exists today if such an initiative is undertaken.

The Indian central banker said there is a need for wider adoption of CBDC, and appealed to peers from across the world to ensure that private virtual currencies like Bitcoins are not allowed to grow and any digital currency adoption is limited to the fiat currencies or the ones issued by monetary authorities.
""It would therefore be in the interest of the global financial system to maintain the achievements that it has got over the last couple of decades by putting as much effort as possible into ensuring that any digital currency usage or most digital currency usage should be restricted to fiat currencies,"" he added.
Sankar said India's model of the public sector is leading by creating the necessary infrastructure, and the private sector responding by coming up with innovations that can work on the platform created by the state can be emulated across the world.
The RBI and the BIS Innovation Hub (BISIH) of the bank for international settlements have jointly launched the fourth edition of the G20 TechSprint, a global technology competition to promote innovative solutions aimed at improving cross-border payments.
The event
open
to developers from around the world
will
focus on three problem statements on cross-border payments, including solutions to reduce illicit finance risk, forex and liquidity technology solutions to enable settlement in emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) currencies and technology solutions for multilateral cross-border CBDC platforms.

Finance ministry sees G-sec yields on downhill trek,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/finance-ministry-sees-g-sec-yields-on-downhill-trek/articleshow/99996256.cms,05-05-2023,"The
finance ministry
expects the yield on government securities - which dropped below the 7% mark for the 10-year paper in intraday trade on Thursday for the first time in about 13 months - to moderate further over the course of this fiscal year, a senior official said.
The yields on short-term instruments like
treasury bills
, too, will likely ease, he added. The yield moves in the opposite direction of a bond's price.
""In addition to the global factors (including the recent drop in oil prices and a possible pause on rates by the US Federal Reserve), the feeling among bond market participants that government securities won't flood the market in FY24 is finally sinking in. Domestic inflation, too, is likely to moderate,"" said the official.
This will ease pressure on private borrowers at a time when capital spending by the private sector is expected to gain further traction, he added.
Given the sharp hike in the capex budget of the railways and the road transport ministries, their affiliated entities are unlikely to borrow much from the market this fiscal year. Also, the Centre's budgeted long-term capex loans of a record ₹1.3 lakh crore to states in FY24, against ₹76,000 crore (revised estimate) in the last fiscal year, will cut their borrowing requirement proportionately, officials said.
Live Events
Moreover, the signal by the US Fed on Wednesday of a potential pause in its rate tightening cycle, after it hiked the interest rate by 25 basis points, helped domestic bond yields to ease as well. Global Brent crude oil prices have also dropped by about 9% since last Friday.
At 7.01%, the 10-year benchmark
G-sec
yield has now dropped by over 40 basis points since hitting a nearly four-month high on February 27. The cut-off for the 91-day to 364-day treasury bills yields was in the range of 6.9% to 7% on Wednesday; it has remained around these levels since mid-April.
The Centre has pegged its gross market borrowing for FY24 at ₹15.43 lakh crore, lower than the ₹16 lakh crore that some analysts had expected before the budget announcement. It has proposed to borrow 57.6% of the full-year target in the first half of the fiscal year.
Sovereign green bonds
The finance ministry expects greater investor interest for the sovereign green bonds in FY24, which could raise the ""greenium"", or the premium for being a green security. The size of the FY24 green bond issuance will be announced along with the government's borrowing plan for the second half of this fiscal year. However, it is likely to be higher than the ₹16,000 crore raised last fiscal year.

:
The Centre is expected to achieve the FY23
fiscal deficit
target of 6.4% of
gross domestic product
(GDP) despite a downward revision in national income from the budgeted levels, said a person aware of the details.
The actual FY23
fiscal
deficit, in absolute terms, will likely be slightly lower than the revised estimate (RE) of ₹17.55 lakh crore, he said.
""The nominal GDP for FY23 was marginally revised down in the second advance estimate. But that shouldn't be a problem now, as the fiscal deficit in absolute terms may also drop a bit from the RE,"" he said.
The fiscal deficit numbers for FY23 will be formally released by the government at the end of May.
The second advance estimate for FY23 released on February 28 pegged nominal GDP at ₹272 lakh crore, lower than budgeted ₹273.1 lakh crore.
Live Events
The provisional estimate of the full-year (FY23) GDP will be announced on May 31.
The Centre's net tax collection in FY23 could be a tad higher than the revised estimate, while expenditure would be marginally lower than the RE, he added.

At the given point when sanctions are imposed, sources said, it would not be feasible for India to opt for other than SWIFT network.
Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong launched the cross-border connectivity between UPI and PayNow.
Linkage of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Singapore's PayNow now allows people in the two countries to undertake faster and cost-efficient digital transfers.
It will also help the Indian diaspora in Singapore, especially migrant workers and students, through instantaneous and low-cost transfer of money from Singapore to India and vice versa.
The PayNow-UPI linkage is the world's first real-time payment systems linkage to use a scalable cloud-based infrastructure that can accommodate future increases in the volume of remittance traffic.
To begin with, the
State Bank of India
,
Indian Overseas Bank
,
Indian Bank
and
ICICI Bank
will facilitate both inward and outward remittances while
Axis Bank
and DBS India will facilitate inward remittances.
The UPI was launched in 2016, and since then it has emerged as the most popular and preferred payment mode pioneering person-to-person and person-to-merchant transactions, accounting for 75 per cent of the total digital payments.
The volume of UPI transactions has increased manifold from 0.45 crore in January 2017 to 804 crore in January 2023. The value of UPI transactions has increased from just Rs 1,700 crore to Rs 12.98 lakh crore during the same period.
National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) was incorporated in 2008 as an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India.
It has created a robust payment and settlement infrastructure in the country. It facilitates payments through a bouquet of retail payment products such as RuPay card, Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), UPI, Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), BHIM Aadhaar, National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC Fastag) and Bharat BillPay.

Centre laments non-utilisation of fund by state animal husbandry departments; urges states to spend,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/centre-laments-non-utilisation-of-fund-by-state-animal-husbandry-departments-urges-states-to-spend/articleshow/99870836.cms,29-04-2023,"The Centre on Saturday rued that
animal husbandry departments
in state governments are not fully utilising central funds for development of this sector and urged them to spend money to implement projects. Addressing an event to mark the '
World Veterinary Day
', Union Minister of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and
Dairying Parshottam Rupala
stressed on registration of birth and death of livestock for having a real time data.
The 'World Veterinary Day' honours the veterinary profession every year on the last Saturday of April.
Rupla said the government conducts 'Livestock Census' regularly, but there is no provision currently for registration of birth and death similar to human beings.
""This is a shortcoming in the animal sector,"" he said, and stressed on addressing this gap.
There should be some scientific way to count birth-death in livestock sector as real time data will benefit all stakeholder and help achieve higher growth, the minister said.
Live Events
Livestock Census covers all domesticated animals and its headcounts for total 16 species of animals including cattle and buffalo. As per the census 2019, the total livestock population stood at 536.76 million in the country.
Speaking at the event, Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Sanjeev Kumar Balyan highlighted that the budget allocation of this ministry has increased in the last few years. An outlay of Rs 12,500 crore has been announced for tackling foot and mouth disease and brucellosis, he added.
""We (Centre) do not spend money.
States
do it. We provide funds to states for undertaking projects in this sector. Vaccination process is under the Centre and 100 per cent funded by the central government,"" Balyan said.
""It's very unfortunate that in the last 2 years, animal husbandry departments in the states/UTs have not been able to utilise central funds. Every year, we have to surrender funds allocated under the central budget,"" Balyan said.
The ministers and bureaucrats in state governments should see how to enhance the spending capacity for effective implementation of the programmes, Balyan said.
Even in the last financial year, he said, the budget amount was not fully utilised.
""States are not able to utilise funds despite repeated request,"" Balyan said.
He lamented the inferiority complex among bureaucrats and ministers in state governments, who have been given charge of the animal husbandry department and attributed it as the reason for lack of enthusiasm to spend central funds.
The minister said he is proud of being veterinary doctor and there should not be any inferiority complex.
On sidelines of the event, Balyan said there is no dearth of fund and states should spend money for the growth of this important sector.
Earlier, Rupala highlighted the importance of animal husbandry in India and said this profession must have started before farming activities. He noted that India is the largest milk producer in the world and the value of milk output is pegged at around Rs 9-9.5 lakh crore annually, higher than the values of wheat and rice combined.
Talking about the challenges, Rupala said average productivity is still less and said efforts should be made to enhance it.
He said new technologies like artificial insemination, IVF, semen sorting, embryo transfer and cloning of animals are being adopted in this sector but there is a need to scale up.
Rupala said the Centre has sanctioned Mobile Veterinary Units (MVUs), which will prove to be effective in successful use of these technologies.
MVUs provide diagnosis treatment, vaccination, artificial insemination, minor surgical interventions, audio-visual aids and extension services to farmers/animal owners at their doorstep in far-flung area.
The minister spoke about the huge business potential in this sector. He said pet care and animal feed businesses are growing at a fast pace.
Rupala said the government is also working towards modernising fish markets and give experience to customers like shopping malls.

Public and private sector FY22 wage bill gap widens,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/public-and-private-sector-fy22-wage-bill-gap-widens/articleshow/99825155.cms,28-04-2023,"The gap between the private sector and public sector wage bills has widened further in fiscal 2022 to nearly a percentage point, shows an analysis of data on
employee compensation
.
As a percentage of nominal gross domestic product, the
wage bill
of the private sector was 12.7% in the year ended March 21, 2022, compared with 11.8% for the public sector, the analysis by ET has found.
A decade ago, in FY12, the public sector had a higher 12.4% share in the
GDP
at current prices against 9.2% for the private sector. The private sector overtook the public sector in wages in FY20, just before the pandemic.
""Private sector salaries are increasing at a faster rate than the government and the job growth is also higher,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at the
Bank of Baroda
, explaining the gap.
Subdued job growth in the government may also be a reason, he said, adding that the central government was not replacing jobs. ""A lot of outsourcing is taking place,"" he said.

""The level of employment has witnessed this kind of tilt between private and government sectors. Also, the increase in wages is higher in the private sector compared to the government,"" said NR Bhanumurthy, vice-chancellor of Dr BR Ambedkar School of Economics University, Bengaluru (BASE University).
The lag in the implementation of the seventh pay commission by some states is also a reason for lower compensation by the government, he said.
According to a survey by consultancy firm AON, salaries in corporate India rose 10.6% in 2022 and are expected to rise 10.4% in 2023.
Private sector compensation increased 20.3% from FY20 to FY22, whereas growth for the public sector was 12.5%. The nominal GDP grew 16.8% in this period.

PLI
) scheme till March 31. Majority of the beneficiaries are from eight sectors like electronics, telecom, pharma and food processing, a senior official said on Wednesday, adding that the next two-three years will be crucial for projects to move at a fast pace.
PLI schemes for 14 sectors were announced during the Covid pandemic in 2020 with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore to boost domestic manufacturing and exports.
“When the schemes were announced, there was no war (Russia-Ukraine). No investments have been derailed but we expect to get back on track in 2023-24,” said Rajeev Singh Thakur, additional secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), adding that these eight sectors are doing well while few need to increase their pace.
Thakur said that incentive claims of over Rs 3,420.05 crore have been received under the scheme for eight sectors – large-scale electronics manufacturing; electronics and technology products; bulk drugs; medical devices; pharmaceuticals; telecom and networking products; food items; and drones, of which “over Rs 2,800 crore have already been disbursed”.

“The next two-three years will be crucial and we hope things to move at a fast pace,” he said, adding that there is no structural fault in the schemes but not all are going ahead at the same pace as was envisioned.
“Therefore, more stakeholder consultations are needed… wherever required, Niti Aayog and the empowered group of secretaries will look at procedural lapses,” he said. Cabinet Secretariat could do a “stronger review”.
As per the department, till December 2022, 717 applications have been approved in 14 sectors with expected investments of Rs 2.74 lakh crore. Actual investment of Rs 53,500 crore has been realised, which has resulted in incremental production/sales of over Rs 5 lakh crore and employment generation of over 3 lakhs.
The highest disbursal- of Rs 1,649 crore- was made in large scale electronics manufacturing, followed by pharmaceuticals drugs at Rs 652 crore, and food products at Rs 486 crore.
Apple manufacturing in India gave a push to electronics while there are some specific issues in the textile PLI.
When asked about plans to include more sectors under the scheme, he said that demands are coming from different industries but no decision has been taken yet.
“No decision has been taken on whether new PLIs will be given and when,” he said.
White goods, advanced chemistry cells, auto components and textiles are among other sectors where PLI benefits are being given.
“We expect that in the next 2-3 years, things will move at a healthy rate,” he added.

Loans against fixed deposit grow the fastest,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/loans-against-fixed-deposit-grow-the-fastest/articleshow/99790871.cms,26-04-2023,"Fixed deposits aren't just a safe way to park one's savings, but are becoming a popular tool to borrow funds. As interest rates climb to a three year high, those who would have taken a personal loan or an unsecured business loan are resorting to borrowing over the
FDs
as collateral.
Loans against FDs rose 43 percent last fiscal year, the highest rate in nearly a decade, data shows and has emerged as one of the fastest growing
retail loan products
which have been driving the bank loan books. Outstanding portfolio of loan against shares are at Rs 1.13 lakh crore as of end February, up from Rs 79,349 crore a year ago.
Loan against FD (Fixed Deposit) is a type of secured loan where customers can pledge their
fixed deposit
as security and get a loan in return. The amount of the loan depends on the FD deposit amount. This can go up to 90% – 95% of the deposit amount.
“FD rates are at its peak and clients are investing their investable surpluses in FD for the last two to three quarters” said Soumitra Sen, consumer banking and marketing at
IndusInd Bank
. Weighted average interest rates on outstanding deposits have gone up by over 100 basis points in the last one year, latest RBI data shows.
The interest rate for overdraft on fixed deposits is generally 1-1.5% over & above the FD rate. The country’s largest lender
State Bank of India
for example charges 1% above the relative time deposit rate. “ So the client gets money at 8-9%…much cheaper than a personal loan or a business loan” Sen said.

Besides, many banks offer attractive features such as
flexible payback
duration, pay only when you use and interest is charged accordingly. Its sanctions are quick and most of the time application processing and disbursement is over the counter and even zero processing fee. Moreover, since the borrower does not break the deposit. He need not pay any penalty either.
Banks too are comfortable lending on such deposits as in addition to an exposure to a safe asset their resources- the deposits are intact even as they grow their loan book. Also, it is easy to monitor such assets as these loans are linked to their savings or current accounts in addition to having low risk weightage assets for the bank
With
bank loans
driven more by retail loans which have risen at a higher rate of over 20 percent than the sector average of nearly 15%, there are concerns about overheating of such loans. But bankers say that the delinquencies of such loans including loans against deposits are negligible.

During the meeting, which was attended by Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra, CBDT Chairman Nitin Gupta and all members of the CBDT, efforts for increasing tax payer base, pending disciplinary proceeding cases, disposal of applications for condonation of delay and grant of exemptions under certain sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961, were reviewed.
The finance minister emphasised that CBDT should ensure timely and appropriate actions on all applications filed by tax payers and desired a reasonable time frame for disposal of such applications.
She also exhorted CBDT to expand and strengthen its efforts to increase tax payers' awareness regarding the provisions of the direct tax laws and compliance, the ministry said.

credit
growth momentum is waning and the crucial non-food loans growth is likely to slip to 10 per cent in FY24 from more than 15 per cent in FY23, reported PTI, citing a Japanese brokerage on Monday.

Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
Diminishing level of inflation, especially on the wholesale side which tends to lower

needs, and an expected moderation in
GDP
growth to 5.3 per cent in FY24 were cited as the primary reasons for the lower
bank
credit growth expectation by
Nomura
.
""... we expect credit growth to moderate to 10 per cent in FY24 from 15 per cent in FY23,"" reported PTI, citing analysts at the brokerage as saying in a report, adding that the base effect will also be partly responsible for driving the number down.
They also said the rate hikes of more than 2.50 per cent by
RBI
in the current tightening cycle will impact credit growth through a lagged impact on borrowings, and already, there are some signs of a dent on the
home loan
front.
The credit growth momentum is already moderating, the brokerage said, pointing out that the number has come down to 15.4 per cent in March as compared to 16 per cent in February and 16.7 per cent in January.

GST fraud a new challenge for UP government; Noida sees cases double in three years,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gst-fraud-a-new-challenge-for-up-government-noida-sees-cases-double-in-three-years/articleshow/99702896.cms,23-04-2023,"Noida, In the last three years,
GST fraud in Noida
has doubled as irregularities have been detected in 291 cases of
GST
evasion, for which a fine of Rs 75.82 crore has been collected.
According to the data of the Uttar Pradesh tax department, in the 2020-21 fiscal, a fine of Rs 18.04 crore was collected in 66 cases of tax evasion. In 2021-22, fraud worth Rs 11.56 crore was detected in 91 cases, while in 2022-23, 134 tax evasion cases were unearthed, in which a fine of Rs 45.72 was collected.
Talking to IANS, a state GST official said that
fake tax invoice
is like a fake note which is dangerous for the society. With a fake tax invoice, one can shrug off one's genuine liability. Tax invoice is like a currency note, if it is fake it will create trouble and the
revenue collection
of the government will take a hit, the official said.
He added that most of these irregularities are seen in sectors which are organised and informal, because they have no proper system like big companies. Big companies have proper accounting system and management, along with other systems which prevent these kinds of frauds.
But in most unorganised sectors or companies, these irregularities can be done very easily because there is no proper accounting system. And that's why frauds are seen in big scrap companies, steel and iron companies, pan masala companies, wholesalers of big goods, etc.
Live Events
But smart tools and apps which have come up now can detect these irregularities. Besides, the field officers of the GST department are also keeping a close watch on such practices.
Sometimes decoding information in large networks manually is quite challenging, but if one decodes it through software or app, it can be cracked easily.
Companies evade GST when they sell goods but do not provide the bill. The common man can also prove to be helpful in stopping such malpractices by insisting for the bill.
When one does not take a bill, the seller can show that the product is still in the stock though it has been sold, and can easily generate a tax invoice of the same value and give it to anyone.
The cases of GST evasion by creating bogus firms are also increasing rapidly. Frauds worth crores of rupees have been carried out by getting GST registration done on the basis of fake address and documents. As per the figures, 22 bogus firms have been unearthed in 2020-21, 27 in 2021-22 and 58 in 2022-23.

Foreign angels – trouble in Indian paradise?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/foreign-angels-trouble-in-indian-paradise/articleshow/99668342.cms,21-04-2023,"Widening the scope of
angel tax
to money raised from non-resident investors has been one of the most discussed aspects of this year’s Union Budget. A provision which was introduced in 2012 with the original objective to tax unaccounted money finding its way back into the system through share issuances at unusual premiums, has been used by the income tax authorities to raise demands on start-ups raising capital at valuations unheard of in traditional business models so far.
Hitherto, capital raised from non-resident investors and from domestic
AIFs
or VC funds was exempt from the ambit of angel tax.
Removal of the exemption for non-residents while retaining it for domestic AIFs has now created an unequal playing field for funds which are domiciled offshore such as in Singapore or Mauritius. Even money infused by foreign companies in their Indian subsidiaries is under the scanner now.
It is imperative to note that the angel tax provisions are specifically exempted for recognised start-ups not having completed ten years from incorporation meeting specified criteria. These criteria, inter alia, include aggregate share capital and premium not exceeding INR 25 crores and turnover not exceeding INR 100 crores.
Given the financial thresholds, currently the benefits are available only to a select number of smaller new start-ups.

With global liquidity squeeze leading to the onset of the funding winter for Indian start-ups, raising capital has become quite challenging. Amidst such times, an onerous tax provision such as angel tax is likely to further dent the ability of Indian start-ups to raise capital at good valuations.
While the FEMA Regulations permit an Indian company to raise capital from foreign investors at or above the fair market value of the shares, one can now expect heightened negotiations and discussions on valuations and indemnities as foreign investors would want to factor the risk of an angel tax related litigation on valuations and returns.
The tax department has litigated on fair market values where the actual future performance has been at a deviation from that projected at the time of the fund raise. The strength and credibility of the valuation exercise assumes even more significance against this backdrop.
While the jury is still out on whether this move will push Indian start-ups to offshore ownership structures or prompt more foreign venture capital funds to float domestic AIFs to participate in the India growth story, indications from the DPIIT to consider relaxations in some of these provisions in consultation with the Ministry of Finance certainly is a gleam of hope for the Indian start-up community.
Exempting funds raised from SEBI registered foreign portfolio investors or from foreign VC funds managed by licensed fund managers, will help bring capital raising from professional domestic and foreign investors at par. Similarly, exemption for funds raised from companies listed on overseas stock exchanges should be actively considered. Additionally, it may be prudent to consider providing for tolerance limits to enable raising funds from foreign investors at higher than fair market value as permitted by the FEMA Regulations.
Raising the turnover and capital related exemption thresholds for DPIIT recognised start-ups will also provide a shot in the arm for some of these businesses where access to capital flows is crucial for long term sustainability and value creation.
Whether the industry expectations will be duly considered by the Government remains to be seen but some of the above relaxations will surely go a long way in helping Indian businesses raise growth capital in tough times such as these.

The modus operandi adopted by fraudsters included short
payment
of tax by undervaluing taxable goods and services, wrong availment of exemption notifications, wrong availment of the input tax credit, non-payment of tax on
supply
of taxable goods and services (clandestine removal), and fraudulent availment of the input tax credit on the basis of invoices from fake firms.
In a reply to the
Lok Sabha

Finance Ministry
said total GST evasion detected between July 2017 to February 2023 was close to Rs 3.08 lakh crore, of which over Rs 1.03 lakh crore was recovered. GST authorities had arrested 1,402 persons for evading taxes in the last five-and-a-half years till February 2023.

NPA of self-help groups down to 1.8 per cent: Rural Development Minister,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/npa-of-self-help-groups-down-to-1-8-per-cent-rural-development-minister/articleshow/99589988.cms,18-04-2023,"Non-performing assets (
NPAs
) of self-help groups (SHGs) have gone down to 1.8 per cent,
Union Rural Development
Minister
Giriraj Singh
said on Tuesday and called upon banks to provide incentives to those having
NPA
of less than one per cent. Speaking at an event here, Singh said NPA for self-help groups was 9.58 per cent in 2014. ""NPA has come down to 1.8 per cent as I speak...,"" he said.
Singh stressed that loans given to those in need do not become NPA.
""When I was the Cooperative Minister, I sent a team to Bangladesh to understand why NPA was lesser there. When they returned, I understood that need-based
finance
never becomes NPA. The loans given at face value become NPA,"" he said.
The minister said that a waiver of three per cent will be given on the interest being paid on loans. He also urged banks to provide incentives to those who have NPA of less than one per cent.
Singh was speaking at a gathering after launching ""Sangathan Se Samridhhi - Leaving No Rural Woman Behind"", a national campaign aimed at mobilising 10 crore women from eligible rural households into self-help groups.
Live Events
The minister said that in 2014, only 2.35 crore women were part of self-help groups and the number has increased to more than nine crore now.
""Our aim is to increase the number to 10 crore by 2024,"" he said.
He said the government is working on covering SHG workers under a pension scheme.
The campaign's primary objective is to mobilise disadvantaged rural communities unaware of the benefits of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM).
The campaign will be organised in all states with the expectation of forming more than 1.1 lakh SHGs.
SHG members from different states participated in the event and women from Bihar,
Tripura
,
Telangana
,
Maharashtra
and
Haryana
shared their experiences on how the DAY-NRLM SHG movement supported them to come out of
poverty
by creating livelihood opportunities leading to their economic independence and social empowerment.

This was for the first time that the state-level function was held in Kaza, around 325 km from the state capital, in remote Lahaul-Spiti district.
After unfurling the tricolor, the Chief Minister conveyed his greetings to the people and expressed gratitude to Yashwant Singh Parmar, the first Chief Minister of the state.
The decision to hike DA would put an additional burden of about Rs 500 crore on the state's exchequer, an official statement said.

Stocks Shine, Rupee Rises
RBI data show that so far in April, the central bank has absorbed a daily average of Rs 2.05 lakh crore from banks - and Rs 2.71 lakh crore on April 5. The last time banks had parked a larger amount with RBI was on July 6, 2022.
It was also in that month that RBI received funds comparable with the Rs 2-lakh-crore daily average so far in April, the data show.
NSDL data showed that foreign portfolio investors have acquired $1.1 billion worth of Indian equities so far in April, the largest monthly purchase so far in 2023. The rupee, too, has appreciated 1% so far this calendar year.
Intraday, the call money rate dropped as much as 190 basis points below the repo rate, reflecting the extent of excess liquidity.
At RBI's policy statement on April 6, deputy governor
Michael Patra
flagged the enormity of likely government's spending at the beginning of the year.
Typically, around 60% of government expenditure occurs in the first six months of a financial year. The Centre has earmarked Rs 10 lakh crore in the current fiscal for capex. Last fiscal, the government adopted a slower approach to capex spending until clarity emerged on its revenue streams, analysts said.
According to analysts, it was likely that amid its large spending push, the government was currently availing of the WMA.
Incidentally, surplus liquidity in the banking system comes amid ongoing redemptions of long-term repo operations conducted by RBI in 2020 to provide sufficient funds through the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.
RBI data show that banks are scheduled to return a total of Rs 61,113 crore worth of funds to the central bank this month as the repos mature. Of this, Rs 33,935 crore worth of redemptions have already occurred.
Caution Ahead
Going ahead, however, liquidity conditions are set to tighten, in line with RBI's stance of withdrawing monetary accommodation. Stripping away unpredictable foreign exchange flows, the principal catalyst for tighter liquidity would be increases in currency in circulation (CIC) in the economy, analysts said. Rising CIC results in funds leaving the banking system.

"India's pension scheme review must prioritise fiscal prudence, development spending, economists say",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-pension-scheme-review-must-prioritise-fiscal-prudence-development-spending-economists-say/articleshow/99403732.cms,11-04-2023,"The federal government's decision to review the pension scheme for its employees must not come at the cost of prudent fiscal management, economists told Reuters on Tuesday.
They feared that a higher share of government revenues going towards salaries and pensions will compromise development expenditure.
The centre's decision to review the pension system - a committee for which was set up last week - follows a move by a few large states to revert to an older scheme.
Under this scheme, the burden of funding pensions fell on the government with no contribution from the employees.
""Questions of fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity need to be at the core of the review,"" said Radhika Pandey, senior fellow at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP).

The federal government's
fiscal deficit
, targeted at 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 2024, is higher than the medium-term target of 4.5%.
The country's debt-to-GDP ratio of close to 84% of GDP is also well above the 60% recommended by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Review Committee in 2018.
Nearly 41% of the government's revenue receipts go towards interest payments and another 9% goes towards pensions, squeezing space available for other spending.
The federal government cannot afford any change in the pension scheme, which would add to its fixed liabilities, said Govinda Rao, former member of the 14th Finance Commission.
There is no reason to go back to the old pension scheme or a defined benefits scheme and ""any decision on this will be purely political,"" said Rao.
States that have decided to move back to a plan commonly known as the old pension scheme include Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have said they are reviewing their options.
The federal government and most state governments replaced the old pension scheme with the National Pension Scheme (
NPS
) in 2004, under which employees and the government shared the financial burden.
The NPS is a voluntary retirement savings scheme requiring employees to contribute 10% of their basic salary, while employers contribute up to 14%. In return, employees get an annuity when they retire based on their contributions.
States that have opted for this scheme already have a large share of their revenue going towards salaries and pensions, said NR Bhanumurthy, vice chancellor of the BR Ambedkar School of Economics in Bengaluru.
Any return to the old pension scheme will compromise developmental expenditure, he added.
The state of Andhra Pradesh adopted a middle path - it is continuing to ask employees to contribute towards their pensions but is also guaranteeing a pension equivalent to 33% of the last drawn basic salary.
""The question of guaranteed return is fraught with arbitrariness,"" said NIPFP's Pandey. ""They run the risk of making the system complex.""
Any such move will also benefit a very small section of government employees, as nearly 90% of India's workforce is employed in the informal sector where there are no such benefits.
""Instead, to fund something like this, you would tax the rest of the workforce further,"" said Rao.

"Gold schemes' mopup breaches Rs 50,000 crore",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/gold-schemes-mopup-breaches-rs-50000-crore/articleshow/99388008.cms,10-04-2023,"The cumulative collection through two government schemes launched to discourage physical gold purchases and reduce
imports
crossed the ₹50,000-crore mark for the first time, seven years after they were rolled out.
At the current retail gold rate, this is equivalent of 85 tonnes of the precious metal, representing 11% of the country's demand for the precious metal in the 2022 calendar year.
""They (net mop-up) stood at ₹50,216 crore as of December 2022, against ₹42,507 crore a year earlier,"" a senior
finance ministry
official said.
The government had in November 2015 launched sovereign gold bonds and a gold monetisation scheme.
Live Events
The sovereign
gold bond scheme
was targeted at those looking at gold as an investment - helping them buy paper gold instead of physical gold. The gold monetisation scheme sought to bring out idle gold with households, temple trusts and others to raise domestic supply.
Both were intended to curb gold imports, which, together with crude oil, are a big contributor to
India
's current account deficit. ""Sovereign gold bonds have become popular and accounted for much of these collections. The monetisation scheme, despite improvement in recent years, will take some more time to be popular,"" the official told ET.
Having scaled a peak of ₹16,049 crore in the pandemic year of FY21, gold bond issuances have since moderated as investors preferred more attractive equity investments. The net issuances of sovereign gold bonds (after factoring in redemption) eased to about ₹11,700 crore in FY23 from ₹12,808 crore in the previous year. It could drop further to ₹9,700 crore in FY24 against gross issuances of ₹11,200 crore.
The bond redemptions are expected to rise five times in FY24 to ₹1,500 crore, as investors may take advantage of the elevated gold prices once the initial five-year lock-in period is over for many of them, according to analysts.
The net mop-up under the monetisation scheme is estimated to have eased to ₹730 crore in FY23 from ₹1,390 crore a year before, said the official. It's expected to touch ₹813 crore in the current fiscal year.

"People queue up for gold loans as yellow metal prices touch a new high of Rs 61,000; NBFCs turn cautious",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/people-queue-up-for-gold-loans-as-yellow-metal-prices-touch-a-new-high-of-rs-61000-nbfcs-turn-cautious/articleshow/99374437.cms,10-04-2023,"As
gold prices
touched a new high of Rs 61,000 per 10 gm, people are queuing up for
gold
loans. But the
gold loan NBFCs
are taking a cautious approach to minimise the risk of loans being taken into auction to a bare minimum, if there is a sudden decline in gold prices from higher levels.
For
gold loan
takers, the EMI becomes higher when the gold prices go up and sometimes they fail to repay the loan. The NBFCs then have to auction the gold in the market at the prevailing rate, which may be lower than the price at which the gold was pledged by loan takers
Rohan Juneja, managing director & CEO
TruCap Finance
said “We see the rising gold prices to bring positive results for the business, thanks to increasing collateral coverage. However, we as a company tend to adopt more cautious steps in lending during such times with an aim to minimize the risk of loans being taken into auction to a bare minimum, if there is a sudden decline in gold prices from higher levels.”
Retail demand for gold loans has seen a steady uptick in urban as well semi-urban areas in comparison to other loan products, especially since the customers are realizing benefits and value waiting to be unlocked with gold as a collateral. “More than 70% of our disbursals are happening in semi-urban areas,” said Juneja.
Recently, there have been several factors that have supported higher gold prices, including concerns over the sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases in major cities, inflation fears, and a weaker US dollar. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has signalled that it will maintain a loose monetary policy for the foreseeable future, which could continue to support gold prices.
Live Events
“We have witnessed strong growth of 5%-10% month-on-month for the last two to three quarters,” said Deepak Singhal, senior vice president, Rupeek, a new age gold loan company.
Anuj Arora, COO & Co-founder of SahiBandhu, a gold loan aggregator has experienced exponential growth in gold loans over the last few months. “The increase in gold’s price is seen as a positive by people. Within the semi-urban community, we have also witnessed growth of gold loans amongst the farming community, and Rs 1500 crore of our gold loan disbursal portfolio consists of farmers and agriculturists.”
Umesh Mohanan, ED & CEO, Indel Money added ""The gold price rise, in a way, benefits both the lenders or gold loan financiers and the borrowers. We expect the recent gold price rise is likely to spur growth in our gold loan portfolio. The customer queries have increased, as gold price rise boosts the sentiment of the people seeking gold loan. By leveraging our deeper understanding of the market and customer-focussed services, we are confident that we'll continue to meet the evolving needs of the customers.""

Punjab to miss fiscal targets by a wide margin due to freebies: India Ratings,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/punjab-to-miss-fiscal-targets-by-a-wide-margin-due-to-freebies-india-ratings/articleshow/99323863.cms,07-04-2023,"The AAP government's freebies push in Punjab will have the state, which already is one of the most fiscally stressed states, missing the fiscal targets by a wide margin yet again this fiscal, shows an analysis. According to an
India Ratings
'
analysis
of the Punjab budget for FY24, the
Bhagwant Mann
government will likely close the year with a
fiscal deficit
of Rs 33,216 crore which is a whopping 5.3 per cent of
GSDP
or gross state domestic product from the budgeted Rs 23,835 crore or 3.8 per cent in FY24.
This comes on top of the state closing the previous year with a 5 per cent fiscal deficit.
The Centre allows a state to borrow annually only 3 per cent of its GSDP and an additional 50 bps more on meeting certain reforms in the power
distribution
and public transport sectors.
Punjab's fiscal stress will continue even in the medium-term and will remain one of the fiscally most stressed states, says Sunil Kumar Sinha, the senior director at the agency.
This is because the state's fiscal plan for FY25-26 assumes 10 per cent nominal GSDP growth because the assumptions of own
tax revenue
growth of 15 per cent each in FY25 and FY26 also look optimistic.
Live Events
On the other hand,
revenue
expenditure growth assumptions appear to be conservative as the same is assumed to grow at 5.5 per cent in FY25 and 8.6 per cent in FY26, while its average revenue expenditure growth during FY18-22 was 12 per cent.
He further notes that the
revenue deficit
is expected to be around 4 per cent of GSDP, which will be 50 bps higher than the budgeted, primarily due to the optimistic assumption on revenue receipts and nominal GSDP growth.
According to the revised estimate, the state's revenue deficit in FY23 came in at Rs 23,891 crore or 3.7 per cent of GSDP) almost double of the FY23 budget estimate of Rs 12,554 crore or 2 per cent as slippage in revenue receipt was Rs 1,815 crore. This was in spite of doing reasonably well on the tax revenue front.
Although its own tax revenue was lower by Rs 1,448 crore than budgeted, its share in Central taxes was higher by Rs 2,407 crore. The slippage mainly came from the lower
non-tax revenue
, which is expected to be Rs 32,260 crore compared to Rs 35,033 crore budgeted for FY23.
The slippage in the state's own tax revenue (SOTR) is Rs 249 crore and the state's share in Central taxes is Rs 2,524 crore. Yet, total expenditure in FY23 was higher by Rs 7,466 crore despite cutting capital expenditure by Rs 2,056 crore as revenue expenditure was higher by Rs 9,522 crore.
The FY24 budget assumes a nominal GSDP growth rate of 9.5 per cent. But the historical trend during FY16-22 shows only 7.4 per cent growth and given the prevailing macroeconomic environment, nominal growth will be lower at 8.5 per cent in FY24.
The budget also assumes the SOTR to grow 17.4 per cent in FY24 resulting in a SOTR/GSDP ratio of 7.4, up from 6.9 in FY23 and 6.4 in FY22, and the new target looks highly stretched, according to the agency as it expects the STOR to come in lower by Rs 2,905 crore at Rs 48,930 crore.
Similar are the non-tax revenue assumptions, which are budgeted at Rs 28,559 crore down from Rs 32,260 crore in FY23.

NREGS spending drops 5% in FY23,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/nregs-spending-drops-5-in-fy23/articleshow/99305275.cms,06-04-2023,"Spending under the government's flagship rural job guarantee scheme dropped 5% in 2022-23 from a year before, reflecting a moderation in demand with improved economic activities.
Expenditure under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in FY23 at ₹1.01 lakh crore still remained close to 12% higher than the Centre's actual fund release for the year, showed the data from the rural development ministry as of April 5.
The government released ₹90,373 crore for the scheme last fiscal against the revised estimate of ₹89,400 crore.
Given the carry-over funds from earlier years, the total availability of funds for expenditure under the scheme touched ₹1.06 lakh crore in FY23, data showed.
A senior government official said non-lapsable funds from earlier years are also taken into account while fixing the budgetary outlay and that the Centre is committed to allocate adequate funds to cater for any rise in demand.

Pronab Sen, former chairman of the National Statistical Commission, told ET that both enhanced economic activities and some supply-side issues may have caused the moderation in
NREGS spending
in the last fiscal year.
""As for FY24, expenditure under the scheme will be influenced by how agriculture sector performs,"" Sen said. ""If it does well, demand for MGNREGS work will ease; if not, demand will rise again.""
The government has budgeted ₹60,000 crore under the scheme for FY24, 18% lower than the budget estimate of ₹73,000 crore for FY23, but finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has indicated that more funds would be allocated for the scheme if required.
Despite the year-on-year moderation, work generated under the scheme in FY23 remained higher than the pre-pandemic period.
Total person-days under MGNREGS in the last fiscal year stood at 2,930.4 million, down 19.3% from a year before, but up 10.4% from pre-pandemic year of FY20.
The person-days created in FY23 were also 2.7% higher than the initial target for the year (as reflected in the labour budget).
Officials said these are provisional data, which will be revised as and when updated data flow in.
Women accounted for 57.4% of the person-days in FY23, against 54.8% in FY22 and FY20.
As many as 87.5 million workers from 61.8 million households got work in FY23, compared with 106.1 million workers belonging to 72.5 million householders in the previous fiscal year.

The move, part of a renewed push by Prime Minister Narendra
Modi
's govt to slim down the
public sector
, would help the government monetise unused land to minimise losses at state-run companies and help them raise funds.
Land is a state subject in India, with both the Parliament and state assemblies able to write laws around certain land rights. As a result, land disputes often end up tangled in a web of bureaucracy.
The panel's objectives will include negotiating with state governments on disputes for freehold land and deciding on compensation, among others, one of the government officials said.
The officials did not want to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

""Some state governments also use the land owned by federal government-run companies. This panel can explore seeking alternate land from the state governments for such companies,"" the first official said.
The panel will be chaired by a top central government bureaucrat, he added.
In March 2022, the government set up the National Land Monetization Corp (NLMC) to monetise surplus land and building assets of state-owned companies and other government agencies.
Once disputes are resolved, the NLMC would step in to facilitate sales, the first official said.
State-run firms had identified around 14 million square metres of land for monetisation in March 2022, according to data shared by the government in response to a question in the Parliament. However, NLMC is yet to sell any land assets.
The Finance Ministry, which oversees the NLMC, did not respond to Reuters' email seeking comment.
In November, the government asked public-sector firms to consider moving the country's insolvency court to shut loss-making units, while demerging the units' land assets to ensure that land disputes did not hamper the process.

Instant View: What experts think of RBI's surprise rate decision,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/instant-view-what-experts-think-of-rbis-surprise-rate-decision/articleshow/99293389.cms,06-04-2023,"The Reserve
Bank
of India (
RBI
) surprised markets by holding its key
repo rate
steady on Thursday after six consecutive hikes, saying it was closely monitoring the impact of recent global financial turbulence.
The
central bank
said its policy stance remains focused on ""withdrawal of accommodation"", signalling it could consider further rate hikes if necessary. The pause in rate hikes is ""for this meeting only"", said RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das.
The
monetary policy committee
(
MPC
) retained the key lending rate or the repo rate at 6.50% in a unanimous decision.
Most analysts had expected one final 25 basis point hike in the RBI's current tightening cycle, which has seen it raise the repo rate by a total 250 bps since May last year.
RBI Monetary Policy review: Here is what experts have to say about the policy announcement
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to keep the key benchmark interest rate - repo rate - unchanged at 6.5 per cent with readiness to act should the situation so warrant, Governor Shaktikanta Das announced on Thursday, after a two-day monetary policy (MPC) meeting.  Here is what experts have to say about the policy announcement.
Anitha Rangan, Economist, Equirus, Mumbai
Live Events
In a surprising move, the RBI indicated a pause in the monetary policy keeping the repo rate unchanged at 6.5% with ""readiness to act should the situation so warrant"" with a unanimous vote maintaining stance of ""Withdrawal of Accommodation"". Again the governor emphasised that the pause is in this meeting only.
While there may be many reasons to pause, the
fact
that the RBI has noted their ""readiness to act should the situation warrant"" and ""job is not yet finished"" suggests that the pause in all likelihood is temporary.
If the Fed hikes, the RBI will be bound to hike once more. The recent oil supply action from OPEC is a reminder of global uncertainty. There may be room to pause but not let the guard down!
Shilan Shah, Deputy Chief Emerging Markets Economist, Capital Economics, London
The RBI's decision to keep the repo rate on hold today comes as a surprise and belies the central bank's recent hawkish communications. The door remains ajar for hikes in the future but with headline inflation set to fall back to within the RBI's 2-6% target range before long, we think the tightening cycle has now come to an end.
Today's meeting doesn't serve as forward guidance and the hiking cycle could resume if the data warrants it. But given the subdued growth outlook and the likelihood that inflation falls back to within the RBI's target range before long, our view that the tightening cycle is at an end. And interest rates in India rarely stay unchanged for a prolonged period: by the end of the year, the RBI could be laying the groundwork for rate cuts.
Rahul Bajoria, MD & HEAD of EM Asia (Ex-China) Economics, Barclays, Mumbai
As the central bank expects inflation to moderate going ahead, we believe this is the last rate hike in the cycle, and expect the RBI to stay on hold through the rest of FY2023-24. Governor Das flagged unprecedented uncertainty in geopolitics, financial markets and the economic landscape, and continued to sound caution around the inflation outlook, especially core inflation.
We no longer expect any further rate hikes from the MPC in FY23-24. We think only a material upside surprise keeping CPI inflation above 6% for a long period would warrant another rate action by the MPC.
ACHALA JETHMALANI, ECONOMIST,
RBL BANK
, MUMBAI
The policy appears to be a hawkish pause as the MPC turns data dependent whilst it awaits the monetary efficacy from prior rate hikes to play out into the deposit and lending rates.
With the Governor stating that today's pause on policy rates is for this policy only, it has the elbow room to act on rates if inflation readings surprise on the upside.
Basis the current growth-inflation dynamics and the global backdrop, the repo rate is likely to peak out at 6.50-6.75% with a possibility of a final 25bps to be delivered in 1H FY24.
SIDDHARTHA SANYAL, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND HEAD OF RESEARCH,
BANDHAN BANK
, MUMBAI
The RBI's ""surprise"" pause on the repo rate in April is completely in line with our expectation. In fact, the 6-0 voting in favour of a pause is stronger than our expectation.
With the likely softening of CPI to the low- to mid-5% levels in the coming month, the current repo rate of 6.5% implies that India's real policy rate will hover around 1% during 2023-24, while maintaining a policy rate differential of about 1.5% with the US. This clearly helped the decision of a pause on the repo rate.
In the current EBLR regime of immediate and fuller pass through of repo rate hikes to lending rates, it is heartening to see a more balanced and nuanced approach from the MPC.
The material narrowing of trade and current account deficits and range-bound INR must have offered the MPC better comfort for pursuing a more ""Fed-independent"" monetary policy.
RUPA REGE NITSURE, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, L&T FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, MUMBAI
Increased global uncertainty, stable currency in 2023 & the incomplete transmission of the past aggressive rate hikes must have prompted the MPC to take a short break in the rate hiking cycle.
By keeping the stance at withdrawal-of-accommodation and keeping the doors open to further rate hikes, the MPC has clearly signalled that the war against inflation is still not over. Rather, the RBI wishes to wait and watch how the situation pans out amid the threats of El Nino, the global banking turbulence, OPEC production cuts and geopolitical tensions.
SAUGATA BHATTACHARYA, EXECUTIVE VP AND CHIEF ECONOMIST,
AXIS BANK
, MUMBAI
The MPC decision to pause at the review meeting is probably a reflection of the extreme uncertainty which characterises the global economy, and the risks of its potential spillovers into India.
The MPC has also retained the flexibility to tighten policy at future meetings, should high and persistent inflation warrant such action. Retaining the stance at removal-of-accommodation also signals a continued focus on steadily guiding inflation down towards the 4% target.
UPASNA BHARDWAJ, CHIEF ECONOMIST,
KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK
, MUMBAI
The RBI's unexpected pause comes despite the previous readings being elevated above 6%. Given today's policy decision, we expect the RBI to maintain an extended pause and evaluate the lagged impact of previous rate hikes and global uncertainties on growth-inflation dynamics.
VIVEK KUMAR, ECONOMIST, QUANTECO RESEARCH, MUMBAI
The RBI's decision to pause came as a surprise given concerns on elevated and sticky core inflation and the emerging risk of some disruption to the southwest monsoon. While recent global economic uncertainty and financial market volatility appear to have weighed upon the policy decision, concerns about both have eased on the back of prompt action by the Fed and the ECB.
Having achieved a reasonable positive level of real policy rate, it appears that the RBI now prefers to go slow while adopting a data-dependent mode. Room for additional rate hikes has been retained with MPC's policy stance continuing to remain unchanged at 'withdrawal of accommodation'.
In the near term, the gradual decline in liquidity surplus will continue and amplify the monetary policy transmission to money market rates.
MADHAVI ARORA, LEAD ECONOMIST,
EMKAY GLOBAL
, MUMBAI
The unchanged policy rate and stance have been met by non-committal forward guidance, clearly giving more stress to the fluid and uncertain global situation, implying macro assessments might require appropriate adjustments ahead from the policy perspective.
However, the governor stressed that their inflation fight is not over and we are still away from durable disinflation with unyielding core inflation still a concern.
We believe the fear that ""speed can kill"" has led to a dovish turn from a number of central banks in both developed and emerging markets, amid growing concerns over the transmission of policy tightening to growth and the same rub-off is happening in the RBI's reaction function.
KUNAL KUNDU, INDIA ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, BENGALURU
The RBI governor echoed our sentiment that it is time to pause and not only do the health check of the banking system (in the aftermath of the SVB debacle) following the steepest-ever increase in the policy rate but also allow more time for the aggressive monetary policy decision to play out, especially when there's already palpable signs of weakness in domestic economic activity.
While the RBI has stayed put with its forecast of 6.5% growth (we expect a growth of 6.0% with a likelihood of further lowering), growth worries remain rather elevated and hence the focus is shifting away from inflation, as we have been expecting.
We believe that rising corporate concentration and the surge in GST rates announced by the GST council following their 47th meeting in end-June are primary reasons why the path of easing inflation remains wobbly and slope shallow.
PRITHVIRAJ SRINIVAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, AXIS CAPITAL, MUMBAI
The MPC delivered a hawkish pause today against our expectation of a 25-bps hike. We don't see this as a turning point in monetary policy direction. Given elevated inflation and resilient domestic demand, the bias is for further rate hikes in 2023, about 50bp more.
As soon as the MPC sees confidence that the world is not staring at another 'Lehmann-moment' or Global Financial Crisis, it will likely continue with further rate hikes to contain inflation.
CHURCHIL BHATT, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT & DEBT FUND MANAGER,
KOTAK MAHINDRA
LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED, MUMBAI
The MPC's unanimous pause is a reflection of the economic uncertainties surrounding policymaking today. However, as emphasised by the RBI Governor, this pause may not be interpreted as the end of the battle against inflation.
Bond market narrative will now shift focus to how long the MPC will need to persist with existing tightness in monetary policy. In absence of a major global event, we expect an extended pause in the domestic repo rate. This is because, while the inflation is likely to soften in FY24, we are far from MPC's eventual target of 4% headline CPI.
Overall, we expect domestic yields to remain range bound till clarity over the future direction of policy rates emerges. Additionally, the ongoing steepening trend in the sovereign yield curve will be reinforced as a result of this policy. We expect 10-year GSec to trade in the 7.10%-7.40% range in the near term.""
AURODEEP NANDI, ECONOMIST AND VICE PRESIDENT, NOMURA, MUMBAI
Enough (tightening) might be enough was the overarching message from the RBI in the April meeting. We were out of consensus in forecasting that the RBI would pause and keep its stance at 'withdrawal of accommodation' - which is exactly what was delivered.
In our view, this reflects a forward-looking monetary policy that takes into cognisance elevated global growth risks, moderating inflation trajectory, and the need to wait and watch and assess the impact of the sharp policy tightening already delivered.
We maintain our view of 75bps of rate cuts, starting from October.
GARIMA KAPOOR, ECONOMIST, INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, ELARA CAPITAL, MUMBAI
We see today's action as a breather in this rate hike cycle with financial stability taking precedence amid global bank failures and associated tight financial conditions. With stance remaining unchanged, MPC has now become data dependent.
We believe the bar for future rate hikes has increased, especially since near-term prints of CPI will be sub 6%. We expect FY24 CPI to range between 5.2-5.5% in FY24E and GDP growth at 5.7%-5.8% in FY24E.
Key risk to watch out for would be food price rise amid inclement weather conditions and movement in global oil prices.
SUVODEEP RAKSHIT, SENIOR ECONOMIST, KOTAK INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, MUMBAI
The decision to pause at 6.5% was a positive surprise. We believe the RBI is concerned about the uncertainty in global financial markets and the pause is reflective of this concern. We view this policy as a hawkish pause. The tone of the policy remains concerned about inflation, especially core inflation and remains focused on reaching the 4% target over the medium term.
The RBI remains comfortably on the growth front, for now. We believe the risks to this outlook is skewed towards the downside. We expect the RBI MPC to remain on an extended pause. Scope for further hikes is limited given our growth-inflation outlook and impact of the past rate hikes on the same.
ANJALI VERMA, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND CO-HEAD RESEARCH, PHILLIPCAPITAL INDIA, MUMBAI
Uncertainty led to RBI taking a pause along with maintaining reversal-of-accommodation stance. While growth forecasts have been left unchanged, we expect growth to slowdown to 5.5-6% in FY24. The RBI's decision reflects that RBI is acknowledging growth softness along with inflation concerns (is) not that strong anymore.
SUJAN HAJRA, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ANAND RATHI SHARES AND STOCK BROKERS, MUMBAI
With inflation still elevated and most major central banks hiking rates recently, the chance of a 25 bps rate hike was considerable. The RBI opting for a pause seems to suggest that the central bank expects softer inflation and growth. With this, it seems that the RBI has come to the end of rate hike for this cycle. Unless there was a big surprise either on inflation or growth, we expect the RBI to remain in pause mode during 2023.
SAKSHI GUPTA, PRINCIPAL ECONOMIST,
HDFC BANK
, GURUGRAM
Following in the footsteps of some recent global policy announcements (like the RBA), the RBI unanimously delivered a hawkish pause. Growth was revised up to 6.5% while inflation estimates were revised down.
However, the governor highlighted that they will not refrain from taking further action if required, especially in light of the recent increase in oil prices and given core inflation remains elevated.
We could see the RBI now going on an extended pause throughout FY24 while liquidity conditions continue to tighten. Short term yields could therefore continue to see some pressure.
ADITI NAYAR, CHIEF ECONOMIST,
ICRA
, GURGAON
Financial stability concerns appear to have pre-empted a pause as the MPC assesses the impact of its cumulative 250 bps of rate hikes. If inflation does not fall in line with the MPC's assessment for Q1 FY2024, another hike could be in the offing, especially if the financial stability situation stabilises.
RADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE
The RBI MPC surprised with a pause on Thursday but emphasised that the path ahead will be nimble to address evolving inflationary risks and maintained its hawkish stance. Tone on growth was upbeat, validated by a small upward revision to the FY24 growth target.
Oil projection was cut, besides factoring in the assumption of a normal monsoon. With policymakers highlighting risks to global financial stability, the tightening cycle has likely slipped into an extended pause, barring unexpected shocks. Beyond anchoring inflationary expectations, the impact of tighter monetary policy on supply-side shocks, especially poor weather conditions, is limited, instead requiring administrative measures and fiscal support.

States may be allowed to settle off-budget borrowings by FY27,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/states-may-be-allowed-to-settle-off-budget-borrowings-by-fy27/articleshow/99276816.cms,06-04-2023,"The Centre is considering relaxing the borrowing norm for states to give them one more year till FY27 to bring their 'off-budget' borrowing within the annual budget by repaying such loans.
Many states have already started the clean-up, helping reduce the consolidated off-budget borrowings of the states to ₹18,500 crore in FY23 from ₹67,000 crore in FY22.
The Centre cleaned up its own budget last year when it paid off all the off-budget borrowings by repaying loans such as those taken by the
Food Corporation of India

""The off-the-budget borrowings have come down considerably after strict scrutiny last year,"" a senior official told ET. ""So (states) are being given one more year to adjust their off-the-budget borrowings.""
Off-budget borrowings refer to loans taken by state-run entities where the principal and interest are serviced out of the state's budget.

The Centre had in FY22 issued guidelines saying such borrowings will be considered as part of the overall borrowings of a state to discourage off-budget funding.
States are allowed to borrow up to 3.5% of their respective state GDP and an additional 0.5% if they implement mandated power sector reforms.
Following protests from the states, the Centre allowed four years till March 2026 to adjust their accumulated off-budget borrowings. This is now being extended by one more year.
The relaxation will give more headroom for the states to tap the market as their borrowings for the current fiscal year (FY24) is expected to go up by 28% to ₹6.7 lakh crore.
The off-budget debt was subjected to strict oversight after the Centre noticed many states were taking loans through their institutions, which was resulting in an incorrect assessment of their finances.
This resulted in reduced borrowings by many states including
Telangana
, Kerala,
Uttar Pradesh
and
Tamil Nadu
, among others.
The official said the purpose of the restriction was to ensure transparent practices by the states and once the states have declared such borrowings and owned such practices and liabilities, an additional year will be given for adjusting these borrowings in their budget.
According to ratings agency
ICRA
, Telangana's share in such borrowings was highest at ₹35,300 crore, followed by Kerala at ₹14,300 crore.
The net borrowings through state government securities (
SGS
) in the last fiscal was ₹5.2 lakh crore.
The
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) has already pegged their gross issuance at ₹2 lakh crore for the first quarter of FY24.
In the
Union Budget
for FY24, the Centre increased the allocation for the interest-free capital expenditure loans to states to ₹1.3 lakh crore from ₹76,000 crore in the revised estimates. The enhanced amount will be over and above the normal borrowing limit.

Parliamentary panels unhappy with funding delays by ministries,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/parliamentary-panels-unhappy-with-funding-delays-by-ministries/articleshow/99222979.cms,04-04-2023,"Several
parliamentary panels
have raised questions and expressed unhappiness in their latest reports over inadequate spending and delayed fund release by Union ministries in 2022-23 while the latter have pointed to the expenditure department's stiff 2021
fund flow parameters
for the same.
Factor this, the
school education department
was provided an outlay of '37,383.36 cr in BE 2022-23. However, at RE stage, it was reduced to '32,151.66 cr. Of this, the department was able to utilize only '19,926.23 crores till January 31, 2023, a parliamentary committee report notes.
On the reasons for reduction in allocations under
Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
- the umbrella mission on school education that also subsumes the mid-day meal scheme - the secretary pointed to the 'strict compliance' under the new funding procedure.
He said, ""the proposal for ad hoc grants can be processed only if 75% of the previous year's grants is spent. This resulted in delay in release of funds to states, UTs under Samagra Shiksha and thus, there was a reduction in RE for 2022-23.""
He added that the
Single Nodal Agency
(SNA) is now operational in almost all states and UTs and thus the expenditure, in all probability should increase in the forthcoming years.

The fund flow disruption concerns were raised in several House reports.
The parliamentary Committee on Environment, Forests & Climate Change noted that the actual utilisation of the ministry in 2022-23 is '1,707 cr (till January 2022-23) against a RE allocation of '2,478 cr. This amounts to about 69% budget utilisation which falls short of the 75 percent expenditure target set for third quarter by the Ministry of Finance, it observes.
""While the rule change may have been brought to reduce parking of funds and loss on interest accrued, the approach should have been to reduce collateral damage. The ministry must review the status of states and accounts onboarded and the pending disbursements be cleared as soon as possible,"" the parliamentary panel has said.
The panel on the
Women and Child Development
ministry's demand for grants said it was constrained to observe that the actual expenditure has been showing a declining trend over the years which is 'not only worrisome but is also indicative that there is a need to address the issues which are proving as obstacles'.
The ministry on its part submitted that all its schemes are CSS and are thus implemented by the states and UTs which have to meet the new rules to enable the Ministry to release the central share of funds.
The
Department of Animal Husbandry
informed its associated parliamentary standing committee that ""Percentage Expenditure of 98.7% and 98.5% during the year 2020-21 and 2021- 22 was limited to a mere 56.07% (up to the second month of the last quarter) during the year 2022-23 after imposition of financial discipline by the finance ministry"".
""The Department, thus, apprised the Committee that the pace of expenditure was hampered due to opening of SNA and CNA accounts as per the allocation strategy of the Ministry of Finance"", says the parliamentary standing committee report.

unclaimed deposits
as of February 2023 were transferred to the Reserve Bank by public sector banks (PSBs) in respect of deposits which have not been operated for 10 years or more, Parliament was informed on Monday. These unclaimed deposits belong to 10.24 crore accounts transferred to the
Reserve Bank of India
(
RBI
) as of the end of February 2023.
""As per information available with the RBI, as of the end of February 2023, the total amount of unclaimed deposits transferred to RBI by PSBs in respect of deposits which have not been operated for 10 years or more was Rs 35,012 crore,"" Minister of State for Finance
Bhagwat Karad
said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha.
State Bank of India

Punjab National Bank
Rs 5,340 crore,
Canara Bank
Rs 4,558 crore and
Bank of Baroda
Rs 3,904 crore.
To a question that if SBI officials do not assist/extend any help to the family of deceased and even they do not contact the family who have submitted death certificates of deceased, the minister said, the bank provides help to family of the deceased in settling all cases of claims.
""Settlement of account (s) of deceased constituent are taken up on priority by SBI. SBI staff has been sensitised and instructions are reiterated in all forums of banks at regular frequency,"" he said.
Live Events
For the convenience of SBI customers, he said, the details/ process of settlement of claims without legal representation in respect of account(s) of deceased constituents, the specimen of prescribed forms, as well as updated FAQs for easy understanding have been uploaded on SBI's website.
Every application for settlement of the account of a deceased constituent received at the SBI branch is duly acknowledged, the reply said.
Banks have also been advised to consider launching a special drive for finding the whereabouts of the customers/legal heirs in respect of accounts which have become inoperative, i.e., where there are no transactions in the account over a period of two years, it said.
""Further, it said, banks are required to display the list of unclaimed deposits/inoperative accounts which are inactive / inoperative for ten years or more on their respective websites, with the list containing the names and addresses of the account holder(s) in respect of unclaimed deposits/ inoperative accounts,"" it said.
Finally, it said, banks have been advised by RBI to play a more pro-active role in finding the whereabouts of the account holders whose accounts have remained inoperative.
Replying to another question, Karad said the government's intent to take up privatisation of two Public Sector Banks and one Public Sector General Insurance Company along with approval of a policy of strategic disinvestment of Public Sector Enterprises was announced in
Union Budget
2021-22.
Consideration of issues related to disinvestment and decision on selection, terms and conditions, etc. in case of strategic sale is entrusted to the Cabinet committee designated for this purpose under the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, it said.
The amendments to the relevant Acts are required before initiating the process of privatisation, it said. The necessary legislative amendment to the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 has been enacted, it said.
Further, representations, opinions or recommendations on various issues including, privatisation of PSBs, received by the Government from time to time are suitably examined.

disinvestment
and dividend by the Central Public Sector Enterprises (
CPSEs
) has exceeded the revised target for this fiscal year, despite deferral of its plan to sell a part of its stake in Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) via the offer for sale (OFS) route to the next fiscal.
The government has realised Rs 94,281.86 crore in FY23, against the revised estimate of Rs 93,000 crore, as
dividend proceeds
offset the shortfall in the disinvestment revenue, showed the data released by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). As of March 31, the dividend receipts touched Rs58,988.34 crore, against the revised estimate of Rs 43,000 crore. However, disinvestment proceeds hit Rs 35,293.52 crore, compared with the target of Rs 50,000 crore, thanks to the move to postpone the OFS plan for HZL.
Higher dividend, in addition to robust tax revenue and savings by various departments, will help the Centre contain its FY23 fiscal deficit at the targetted level of Rs 17.55 lakh crore (6.4% of GDP).

The states - including
Maharashtra

capital
Mumbai, India's most populated state
Uttar Pradesh
and Prime Minister Modi's home state of Gujarat - are estimating expenditure to have risen 21.5% in 2022-23, and plan to increase it further by 11% in 2023-24.
However, actual spending data available for the April 2022 -January 2023 period shows expenditure rose only 11% compared to a year ago.
Economists say this trend was likely to be seen across all states.
Indian states release their local budgets through the months of February and March, after the federal budget is proposed.

""While the latest budgets are factoring in an aggressive spending growth in the coming year (2023-24), it must be borne in mind that states have generally failed to achieve their spending targets in recent years, I-SEC PD economists Tadit Kundi, A Prasanna and
Abhishek Upadhyay
wrote.
Indian states collectively tend to spend more than the federal government and have an important bearing on growth and welfare.
""Expenditure (as a % of GDP) has fallen in FY23, despite buoyant revenues,"" wrote Pranjul
Bhandari
, said India chief economist at
HSBC Securities and Capital Markets
.
Bhandari attributes slower state spending to an end of a compensation cess, volatility in oil prices and an increase in commitments linked to social schemes sponsored by the center.
""In addition, steps have been taken to dis-incentivize
off-budget borrowings by the states, Bhandari said.
""We believe each of these drivers of lower state spend are likely to spill over into FY24.""
A lower rate of state borrowings, however, could provide some breathing space for the bond market, making for a silver lining, they said.
Economists at
HSBC
expect state
fiscal deficit
to be 2.3% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in FY23 and 2.5% of GDP in FY24, both lower than the normal permissible limit of 3% of GDP.
I-SEC PD expects states to borrow a gross amount of around 8.1 trillion Indian rupees and a net amount of 5.3 trillion rupees in the coming year.
In FY23, states borrowed 7.6 trillion rupees, below the budgeted 9.1 trillion.

On the payment options for consumers, he said the Reserve Bank of India is clear that the consumer should have a choice of payments.
""I will use my card as I like it and I think that is my right. There is RuPay card and other international card schemes, so the consumer will choose the choice of payments,"" he said, pointing out that earlier the wallets were close loop systems.
"".. now with
RBI
intervention, the wallets are interoperable. So now I have
PayTM
working with my PhonePay wallet, I can go back and scan any QR code,"" he said, adding that similarly, merchants do not have to go back and tie up with each wallet provider to give access to their customers.

Speaking at the sidelines of G20 Sherpa meeting in Kumarakom, he said cross-border real-time remittances is a G20 theme in terms of access, cost, and affordability. ""The G20 is a great forum for the government and regulator. Agreements will be reached with some of the countries before the end of this calendar year so that we start the conversation for the remittances and payments,"" he said.
India and Singapore linking their digital payments systems has shown that bank accounts in different countries can be interoperable, Asbe said. This was made possible when the two regulators and governments came together and defined the framework, rules and regulations, he added.
The RBI had reached out to many regulators, and the Ministry of External Affairs was also reaching out through the various embassies. Asbe said this was a great architecture for the bilateral conversations for cross-border transactions such as payments and remittances.

Need $1 trillion every year to finance sustainable development of poorest countries: Jeffrey Sachs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/need-1-trillion-every-year-to-finance-sustainable-development-of-poorest-countries-jeffrey-sachs/articleshow/99125524.cms,31-03-2023,"New Delhi:
The world should aim to have at least an incremental $1 trillion every year to finance
sustainable development
for the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries, leading economist and director, Center for Sustainable Development, Columbia University, Jeffrey D Sachs said.
Sachs mooted a massive increase in multilateral development bank financing and routine rollover of amortisations for over 20 years for the
G20
Leaders' Summit in September.
Strengthening multilateral development banks is one of the key issues being pressed by India during its G20 presidency.
The G20 has set up a nine-member expert group, co-chaired by former US treasury secretary Larry Summers and the chairman of India's 15th
Finance
Commission NK Singh, to strengthen multilateral development banks. The idea is to identify ways to improve the ability of such institutions to fund a wide range of sustainable development goals and global challenges, including climate change and health issues.
Sachs, who gave a presentation to G20 Sherpas on financing green development on Thursday, said that roughly 1% of world GDP and 3% of world savings should flow towards this. He pointed out that IMF and World Bank debt sustainability framework was deeply flawed with debt to GDP thresholds that were far too low, adding the reason for this was the conflation of two different kinds of risks - liquidity and solvency risks.
