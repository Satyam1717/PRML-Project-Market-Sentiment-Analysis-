Bangladesh's textile industry feels regime change heat,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/bangladeshs-textile-industry-feels-regime-change-heat/articleshow/119314973.cms,22-03-2025,"The textile industry in Bangladesh - the country's biggest foreign exchange earner - is staring at its worst crisis in recent years exacerbated by abysmal support from the interim regime in Dhaka.
Ananta Jalil, a prominent Bangladeshi entrepreneur dealing in readymade garments, alleged earlier this week that the Bangladeshi economy might collapse soon, as chief adviser Md Yunus is forcefully shutting down the garment sector.
Addressing a public forum, Jalil claimed that millions of workers have been rendered jobless and that Bangladesh's garment-related businesses are losing their market worldwide.
Jalil claimed that Yunus is eliminating all incentives for the garment industry, particularly during the Ramadan period and ahead of Eid. This was one of the rarest outbursts from a leading Bangladeshi businessman since the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last August.
Bangladesh's garment industry contributes as much as 84% of its foreign exchange earnings annually. The industry is also a major employer - more than 4 million people directly and nearly 15 million indirectly - with a major share of women.

Stars & stripes on demand: Indian exporters eye boost as US plans another 10% tariff on Chinese imports,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/stars-stripes-on-demand-indian-exporters-eye-boost-as-us-plans-another-10-tariff-on-chinese-imports/articleshow/118691651.cms,04-03-2025,"Indian apparel exporters
are increasing capacities to leverage the US decision to impose a 10% duty on Chinese imports.
They also see the possibility of a settlement between Russia and Ukraine and hope that would improve orders from Europe. Meanwhile, Indian exporters are getting orders from global brands that had been procuring garments from Bangladesh, amid heightened political uncertainties and law-order problems in that country. Manufacturing units in Tamil Nadu's Tiruppur, India's largest garment exporting hub, have doubled their capacity over the past six months to meet the growing demand.
""Those units which had 500 machines have increased it to 1,000 and the bigger units have increased the number to 10,000 machines from 5,000,"" said KM Subramanian, president of the Tiruppur Exporters Association.
The 10% tariff will make Chinese textiles and apparel costlier for US consumers. Industry executives say it would lead to a slowdown in US imports from China, offering India and other textile exporting nations a chance to fill that gap.
Live Events
Tiruppur has around 28,000 manufacturing units involved in various processes across the textile value chain, including knitting, dyeing, bleaching, printing, embroidery, compacting, calendaring, employing roughly 800,000 people. The cluster, which contributes 55% of the country's knitwear exports, is receiving orders from global brands from the US, such as GAP, Carter's, Target and Walmart, as well as European giants like Next and Duns and Australia's Woolworths.
Sanjay Jain, chairman of the ICC National Textile Committee, who exports casual wear to the global markets, is setting up a new plant to increase capacity from 2.5 million pieces to 3.5 million per month. The new plant, which is coming up in West Bengal, will be ready by July-August.
""US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose another 10% duty on Chinese imports. If that happens then, the Indian apparel and textile sector will further benefit,"" he said.
Trump last week said his proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada will go into effect from March 4 and that China will be charged an additional 10% tariff on the same date. Jain said if Trump could help settle the war between Russia and Ukraine, then orders from Europe would also increase. Also, India and the European Union have finalised to give shape to a free trade agreement by year-end, which would provide a fresh fillip to garment and textile sector exports. The production increase will help Indian exporters increase their presence in the global markets, he said. The apparel industry is expecting 10-15% growth in exports in the next fiscal year starting April. Exports have expanded 11.6% from a year earlier in the April-January period of fiscal 2025.
At present, China accounts for nearly a quarter in textiles and apparel imported by the US. In the January-November period of 2024, the US had imported China textiles and apparel worth $99.125 billion, as per latest trade data released by the US Office of Textiles and Apparel.
Bangladesh, the second-largest supplier of garments after China, has not yet fully recovered from the August 2024 political upheaval. In such a scenario, India may be in a strong position to take a large share of the gap created by the imposition of tariffs on China, say exporters.

"From handloom to automated machines, how embroidery machines are getting a modern reincarnation",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/from-handloom-to-automated-machines-how-embroidery-machines-are-getting-a-modern-reincarnation/articleshow/118596659.cms,27-02-2025,"Embroidery, once a painstaking craft mastered by skilled artisans, is now undergoing a remarkable transformation. From hand-stitched patterns to high-speed, precision-driven designs powered by automated machines, the industry has evolved into a billion-dollar market driven by innovation.
Over the past few decades, embroidery machines have significantly improved efficiency, accessibility, and creativity. With the rise of computer-aided embroidery, the process has become faster, more cost-effective, and scalable—paving the way for
mass customization
and business expansion.
The Shift From Manual Stitching to Smart Machines
For centuries, embroidery was a time-consuming craft that required precision, patience, and skill. In India, traditional embroidery techniques like Zardozi, Chikankari, and Kantha have been globally recognised, but their intricate nature often made large-scale production challenging. The introduction of embroidery machines changed the landscape, first with manually operated models and now with fully automated, computerized systems. Modern embroidery machines come equipped with digital touchscreens, automatic thread cutters, and multi-needle functions, allowing users to create intricate patterns with minimal manual intervention.
""Unlike traditional hand embroidery that could take days or weeks to complete, today’s machines can produce complex designs within hours—making embroidery more accessible to businesses, fashion brands, and even independent entrepreneurs,"" Tapan Kapadia, founder of HSW Embroidery Machines said.
Live Events
Kapadia further noted that built-in design templates and touchscreen controls have made it easier for individuals to enter the embroidery business. “Machines now come with pre-loaded design libraries, allowing even beginners to experiment with embroidery without requiring extensive technical knowledge,” he added.
Computerised Embroidery Machines Transforming the Industry
The biggest game-changer has been the rise of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) technology in embroidery machines. These machines allow manufacturers to digitize patterns, ensuring uniformity and efficiency at an unprecedented scale.
""One of the key advancements is the introduction of multi-needle embroidery machines, which can stitch multiple colors simultaneously, eliminating the need for frequent thread changes. High-end models can now handle over a thousand stitches per minute, making large-scale embroidery not only faster but also more affordable,"" Tapan said.
Brands and textile manufacturers have rapidly adopted these machines to meet growing demand, particularly in the fashion and home décor segments. With automation, businesses can maintain design precision while significantly reducing production costs.
Rising Demand for Customization and Small-Scale Businesses
As the e-commerce boom fuels consumer demand for personalized products, embroidery machines have found new relevance in small-scale businesses. From custom T-shirts and corporate branding to home furnishings, buyers are increasingly looking for unique, tailor-made embroidery.
“Small businesses and entrepreneurs are taking advantage of this shift by investing in user-friendly, compact embroidery machines that offer high-quality results. Whether it’s custom apparel, accessories, or business branding, embroidery machines are enabling people to turn creative ideas into profitable ventures,” HSW Embroidery Machines' Tapan Kapadia said.
The Future of Embroidery Machines
The
embroidery industry
is set to witness even more technological advancements in the coming years. Key trends shaping the future include:
AI and Smart Connectivity:
Cloud-based storage and AI-powered design tools will enable seamless access to embroidery patterns across multiple devices.
3D Embroidery
:
Innovations in texture and depth will add a new dimension to embroidery, enhancing the visual appeal of designs.
Faster Production Speeds:
Future machines will further improve stitching speed while maintaining precision, helping businesses scale operations.
User-Friendly Interfaces:
AI-driven automation will simplify embroidery processes, making them more accessible to both professionals and hobbyists.
Sustainable Practices:
The industry is shifting towards biodegradable threads, water-saving techniques, and eco-friendly production methods to reduce environmental impact.

"Apparel discounts are often forced, not custom-made",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-discounts-are-often-forced-not-custom-made/articleshow/118586142.cms,27-02-2025,"MUMBAI: Nearly 40% of
clothing products
sold by Indian retailers on discounts or end-of-season sale (EOSS) are due to mismatch between planned inventory and actual sales, according to
Vector Consulting Group
which partnered NielsenIQ for a survey of the industry. In addition, supply chain issues lead to delays with merchandise reaching stores by 7-30 days late, which shortens the full-price-selling window forcing retailers to offer price-offs, as per the report which surveyed 100 companies.
""The biggest drain in business on margins is the discounting. And as we keep getting better at tightening discounting, getting into more and more of channel mix play, (between stores and online), which drives for reduced discounting,"" said Vishak Kumar, CEO, lifestyle business, at
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
told investors. Vector said executing in-season stock adjustment manually, such as inter-store transfers, is reactive, slow and inefficient. Lead times of over 6-9 months force brands to plan collections a year in advance, making demand forecasting difficult and increasing risk of unsold stock.
""Brands are forced to plan collections far in advance, leading to mismatches in inventory and forecasting errors. Some popular items are stocked out, while there is an excess inventory of others,"" said
P Senthilkumar
, senior partner at Vector Consulting. ""The consequences of these long lead times are far-reaching and create significant operational and financial challenges for apparel brands. First, delays in the supply chain can lead to delays in store drops (7-30 days). Forecasting errors often result in mismatch between planned inventory and actual sales."" Retailers said the festive season was strong but was followed by tepid demand in winter. Value retailer
V-Mart
said while it plans for inventory, predicting seasonal demand is tough.
""Winter was topsy-turvy. We did plan for an inventory but when you do not get a great season, maybe you need to discount a little more, you need to liquidate your inventory or maybe you get a little leftover of the inventory,"" said Lalit Agarwal, MD at V-Mart. Brands said they have been trying to reduce discounting to offset margin pressure, especially online channels. For instance,
Arvind Fashions
said it delayed discounting and didn't go on EOSS sales with the industry since its full-price sell-through was good.
Live Events
""We have stepped away from anything that could be low-quality growth. So, the tail stores being shut down meant square-foot addition had been low in the first half of last year. Discount-led online growth has been stepped away from. So, there was a very clear trade-off done that low-quality growth should be removed from the business model,"" Kulin Lalbhai, vice-chairman at Arvind Fashions, told investors.

"Step up your sock game: Bold, quirky socks are in, and indie brands are leading the way",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/step-up-your-sock-game-bold-quirky-socks-are-in-and-indie-brands-are-leading-the-way/articleshow/118487510.cms,22-02-2025,"Can a pair of boring grey socks spark a business idea?
Kapil Garg
would say, yes. He set up his company,
Thela Gaadi
, in 2021 to sell
quirky socks
, after he glanced at his own uninspiring pair. Back in 2014, as a corporate workhorse, Garg would wear formal attire and soon realised that socks were the only things he could play around with. “One day, I peeped at my shoes and found those boring grey socks sadly looking at me and I wondered why my socks couldn’t be colourful?” Later, while holidaying in Thailand, he picked up
novelty socks
from the local market.
“The socks became a talking point in the office. But the cheap material didn’t last long. This was how the seed for Thela Gaadi was sown.” Garg is a firm believer in the power of socks to elevate your style.
Justin Trudeau would know. His future as the prime minister of Canada might be in doubt, but there is no questioning an enduring legacy—his quirky, colourful and political socks, from pink to rainbow, that gave him a leg-up when he burst into the global political scene. Even as Trudeau’s tootsies made the Canadian Conservative MP Tom Kmiec suggest the appointment of a “minister for sock selection”, his willingness to subvert the drab stereotype of male political style will find a footnote in fashion history.
Quirky socks have been a global trend for over a decade and are largely driven by the rise of
self-expression in fashion
, says stylist and brand image consultant Rishi Raj. Socks have become a stand-in for personality in the dress code of the modern male professional—men account for nearly 65% of the global socks market. In India, Raj attributes the rising trend to the growth of homegrown brands, social media and casual dress codes at the workplace. While designers like Paul Smith have experimented with colours and patterns in socks, it was not until the Swedish brand Happy Socks launched in 2008 that the world noticed quirky socks as a category. In India, there are a slew of indie socks startups such as
Soxytoes
, Thela Gaadi,
Hexafun
,
Sock Republic
,
Dynamocks
, Bombay Socks, Mint & Oak and Balenzia, to name a few.

BEST FEET FORWARD
Novelty socks are here to challenge the old style norms, says Aayush Goenka, founder of Delhibased Soxytoes, which was launched in 2017 to focus on the “noticeable” socks market. He says the novelty, funky, quirky or noticeable—however one qualifies it—socks market in India is powered by millennials and Gen Z. “While India’s share in the global socks market is less than 2%, the good news is that millennials and zoomers account for half of the Indian socks market. The potential market in India is worth Rs 2,500 crore,” claims Goenka.
Harshit Singhal, cofounder of Delhi-based socks and accessories startup Hexafun, says that in India, quirky socks caught on after actors like Ayushman Khurana, Vicky Kaushal and Ranveer Singh were spotted sporting them. He says, “These socks accentuate the overall look with minimal effort that appeals to our main audience, Gen Z, which lives for likes and wants something new to flaunt every day without burning a hole in their pocket.”
Singhal, along with cofounder Manali Sanghvi, started Hexafun with 25 orders a day in 2021. It has now gone up to 1,500 orders daily. Singhal says they have sold over a million pieces. The biggest learning is that there exists a huge audience that still needs to be educated. “Going forward, the investment in education is going to be higher for us to bring about a shift in consumer behaviour. India is still evolving as a market, so it’s important to maintain a balance in designs—from geometric to pop culture to plain bold colours,” he says.
Agrees Manish Gaur, operations manager of Sock Republic, a Noidabased company that was started by Ankur Jain in 2018 to cater to the novelty socks market. Gaur says they have had a 25% growth every year, with a 60:40 ratio of male and female consumers. The brand works on 15-20 new designs every two-three months. It is also adding 10-15 designs in solid colours to the offering. Gaur says when Sock Republic started out, there were very few such brands; now, it seems, the market is flooded. “Almost every day I see new brands on Instagram, but many have shut shop, too,” he says, attributing the jump to the audience coming online.
Goenka of Soxytoes says that since their target customer is less than 45 years of age, they restrict their advertising spend to digital channels, mainly Instagram, but they are also exploring Snapchat and YouTube. He says, “In the past 6+ years, we have sold around 15 lakh pairs.” The brand expects to cross 25 lakh pairs by the end of 2025.
Garg admits that the quirky socks market is getting crowded, but he says designs and quality will be key differentiators. He adds, “Customers want to know the story behind each and every article to connect with it.” He is now noticing a demand for bamboo and organic materials. However, bamboo is not as green as it appears due to its processing and dyes. For reasonably sustainable socks, look for certified organic cotton labels.
Arti Sandhu, an associate professor of fashion design in t he College of Design , Architecture, Art and Planning at the University of Cincinnati, US, showcases her style experiments on her Instagram page @sideways_ toupee and is somewhat of a sockfluencer too. Sandhu says socks and stockings add an extra element to a look for her. “More often than not, they help me either anchor the outfit or connect them to my footwear,” she says.
SOCKS STYLING
The key to styling an unusual accessory is to make it seem deliberate or intentional. A well-curated pair of socks can tie together accessories like a lapel pin, pocket square, or even button detailing, says menswear designer Sandeep Gonsalves, cofounder and creative director, Sarah & Sandeep. His tips? In a corporate setting, start with understated prints in rich hues like burgundy and forest green, opt for muted geometric or tonal patterns, invest in high-quality fabrics and pair bold socks with sleek silhouettes.
Sandhu swears by French brand Bonne Mason for patterns, New Zealand Sock Company for 100% merino socks and counts handknitted Himachali socks as her personal favourite. Her styling tips? “Try connecting the colour of your dress/skirt/pants with matching socks and shoes. It creates a lovely elongation and a fun detail that everyone notices.” Balance is key when it comes to sock styling, says Raj. If your socks are bold, keep the rest of your outfit neutral. Match your socks with an element of your outfit—it can be your tie, shirt, or even subtle accents on your shoes. Avoid loud prints in formal settings. “And mind the length—no ankle peeking under formal trousers.”
Raj notes that the choice of socks is determined by the outfit and the shoes. “With suits, go for a pop of colour in the socks; with cropped trousers, let the socks be a statement; with skirts and dresses, opt for kneehigh socks; and with sneakers and loafers, you can go all out.” As Gonsalves says, “I am all for the art of layering. Let your socks be an unexpected layer of contrast. It can serve as a conversation starter.” It’s time to pull your socks up.

Demand outlook remains strong for Indian textile sector: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/demand-outlook-remains-strong-for-indian-textile-sector-report/articleshow/118376527.cms,19-02-2025,"Although domestic
cotton prices
remain higher than international prices, the overall demand scenario seems to be improving according to a report by Systematix Institutional Equities Research.
It can recover spread in the coming quarters to support the profitability and operational efficiency of Indian textile companies.
The report says the demand outlook remains strong for the
Indian textile sector
because of the normalizing channel inventories at the global retailer level, likely tariff hike by the US on China, rising labour costs in Vietnam, and ongoing political instability in Bangladesh.
The report however raised concern about the capacity constraints of the Indian garment manufacturers, which could limit their ability to take full advantage of the expected surge in demand.
It however noted that driven by stable cotton prices, favourable forex rates, and continued focus on operational efficiency the profitability of Indian manufacturers will improve in the coming quarters.
Live Events
Indian textile companies recorded healthy (YoY) performance with revenue grown by 11 per cent EBITDA growth of 11 per cent and profit after tax (PAT) growth of 28 per cent on an YoY basis. The subdued cotton prices which were down 10 per cent (YoY) and stable yarn prices aided gross margin expansion for spinners.
The
Union Budget 2025-26
also focuses on strengthening the textile sector through cotton productivity initiatives, duty restructuring on fabric, and supporting domestic manufacturing.
Earlier the Government had increased allocation for the textiles sector to Rs 52.7 bn from Rs 44.2 bn in Budget 2024-25.
The government's focus on the Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, manmade fibre, 5-year mission to facilitate productivity improvements, sustainability of cotton farming and the technical textile (TT) market will boost the growth of the Indian textile sector.
An increase in customs duty in the union budget 2025-26 on the import of fabrics will be advantageous to India's technical textile producers.
The Cotton Association of India (CAI) has lowered the cotton production forecast for the 2024-25 season (October-September) by 7.8 per cent (YoY) to 30.17 million bales (170kg per bale) in its January 2025 report from 30.4 million bales in its December 2024 report.
Domestic consumption may stay unchanged at 31.5mn bales in the current season (2024-25). CAI expects a closing stock of 2.59 million bales at the end of the season vs. 3.02 million bales in the last season. However contrary to this, the ICAR-Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) forecasts production at 32.0 million bales.
This figure exceeds earlier estimates ranging between 29.9 million bales and 30.4 million bales.
International cotton prices however have steadily declined and currently hover at USD 0.67- 0.68 per pound vs. USD 0.70 in 2QFY25.
Indian cotton prices have slightly firmed to Rs 54,000-55,000/candy (USD 0.80 per pound) from Rs 52,000- 53,000/candy in 2Q and continue to quote at a premium to international prices.
With a likely reasonable cotton crop, the prices are likely to remain at the lower end of the above range, ensuring predictable input costs in future. (ANI)

The sector is a major employment generator and contributes 11 per cent to the manufacturing sector.
The Union Budget provided for an outlay of Rs 5,272 crore (in Budget Estimates) for the Ministry of Textiles for 2025-26. This is an increase of 19 per cent over Budget Estimates of Rs 4,417.03 crore for the 2024-25 fiscal year.
Bharat Tex, being held in New Delhi from February 14-17, is the textile industry's largest event comprising a mega expo spread across two venues and showcasing the entire textile ecosystem.
The Bharat Tex is becoming a big global event, with more than 120 nations participating in it, Modi said.
India is moving ahead in the direction of manufacturing high-grade carbon fibre, he said.

Welspun Living Ltd
is looking to expand its manufacturing footprint in the US with an eye on being closer to customers of its largest market, according to Managing Director and CEO
Dipali Goenka
. Despite US President Donald Trump's
tariff threats
, the company is optimistic that even if it were to be imposed it will come in a very mutual manner considering India's global standing, but Welspun Living is preparing to thrive in uncertain times, which it has been doing since the COVID-19 pandemic days, Goenka told PTI in an interview here.
""We are in conversation to set up a
utility bedding plant
at Ohio, where we now have the pillow plant,"" she said when asked about the company's manufacturing footprint expansion plans in the US.
She did not elaborate on the planned investment for the bedding plant at Ohio saying talks are still on.
The company has invested USD 12.5 million on the pillow unit in Ohio, which is a fully automated unit.
Goenka further said, ""We will set up another plant at Nevada for manufacturing pillows.""

On the rationale behind the manufacturing expansion in the US, Goenka said, ""We are planning to look at the entire ecosystem, and we are working according to what the market needs.""
She further said, ""It is also closer to the customer...Right now for us, this is becoming a bigger need there, because we can see a great opportunity there.""
The pillows category is as big as towels in the US where the ""consumption is around 1.6 billion"", she said, adding, that is ""humongous as a category"" and the utility bedding is also another important category considering the sleep challenges people in America are facing.
When asked about possible impact of Trump's tariff threats, Goenka said considering India's strength such as the largest democracy, skilled manpower and the biggest supply chain which is going to grow here, the country will be in ""a right position"".
""I actually feel that India is in a positive position...And even if the tariffs come in, they'll be very mutual... it will be a give and take, that's what I'm looking at as a positive spin here,"" Goenka asserted.
On the company's preparedness in case the tariffs are imposed, she said before and after COVID-19 the world has not been the same and the company has learnt to function in uncertain times.
""Whether you see the disruption that happened in freight that time, the complete, massive disruption that happened in commodities, nothing is running in a steady state, geopolitical issues are absolutely galore. The world has changed, and I think this is going to be the new way of working now,"" Goenka said.
She further said, ""Confusion, chaos, uncertainty will rule the roost. We have to thrive in this...""
When asked if the company is in a position to thrive in this, Goenka said, ""We are working on it.""
The company is banking on its ability to predict by closely monitoring supply chains, keeping inventory at warehouses in the US and by being in constant touch with customers, Goenka said.
""So you will have to really look at the micro and the macro. You cannot work in a very steady state kind of a business. You will have to continue to resolve and that's what we are doing,"" she noted.

EU & Ministry of Textiles launches 7 projects to boost textile and handicraft sectors in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/eu-ministry-of-textiles-launches-7-projects-to-boost-textile-and-handicraft-sectors-in-india/articleshow/118278110.cms,15-02-2025,"The European Union (EU) and the Ministry of Textiles on Saturday jointly launched seven new projects to strengthen India's textile and handicraft industry, on the sidelines of ongoing Bharat Tex. Funded by the EU, with EUR 9.5 million (INR 85.5 crores) grant, these initiatives across the entire value chain aim to foster inclusive growth, resource efficiency and sustainability in the Indian textile sector along with driving livelihoods, and women economic empowerment.
These seven projects, spanning the entire value chain, will be implemented across nine states across India - Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Haryana - benefiting 35,000 direct beneficiaries, including 15,000 MSMEs, 5,000 artisans, 15,000 farmer-producers, over the next 3 to 5 years. As many of these projects will also support local communities and industries, it is expected to economically empower around 200,000 women, contributing to a more inclusive, sustainable, and thriving textile ecosystem.
This project builds on the EU's ongoing collaboration with India on sustainability and circular economy, aligning with the Ministry of Textiles' ""Sustainable Bharat Mission for Textiles."" The funding, part of the EU's Global Gateway Strategy, complements the ongoing EU-India Resource Efficiency Circular Economy initiative, co-funded by the German Federal Ministry (BMUV), and is executed jointly with the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Government of India, and being implemented by GIZ. The projects, to be run in partnership with government agencies and private sector partners, have been designed to help preserve Indian cultural heritage in textiles while promoting economic self-sufficiency through enhanced innovation, competitiveness, and market linkages. India’s textile and apparel sector is key and more than 45 million are employed in this field of which 60% are stated to be women. Despite its projected share in India’s export earnings, challenges such as emissions, energy usage, water consumption and low level of recycling persist.
Textiles’ Toolkit, prepared along with GIZ, for fostering Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency in the sector was also launched today.
Speaking on the occasion of the launch, Minister Counsellor and Head of Cooperation of the EU Delegation to India, Franck Viault said, “While fast fashion dominates global trends, both the EU and India have been making serious effort to make the textile industry more sustainable.

Trident Group
on Friday said it has earmarked Rs 1,000 crore
capital expenditure
for FY25-26 for sustainability, modernisation, and asset enhancement initiatives. The group has also set a target of increasing its domestic business by three-fold, by 2027, with its home textile brand, myTrident, expanding into the luxury segment with the launch of 'LUXEHOME by myTrident' label.
""We are going to invest Rs 1,000 crore but out of that, almost Rs 600-650 crore would be in the renewable-sustainability side, the remaining would be on modernisation side,"" Trident Group CEO
Samir Joshipura
told PTI here on the sidelines of
Bharat Tex 2025
.
The group is converting 60 per cent of the energy requirement at Budhni campus in
Madhya Pradesh
into a non-fossil base, he said adding, ""we are going to increase from there"".
Stressing that sustainability is ""going to be a significant focus"" for the group, Joshipura said, ""We want to consciously invest there, because we do see that in future, it may be sooner or later, but in future, this is the only viable option we would have, or any other industry would have.""
Trident Group Chairman,
Rajinder Gupta
, said, ""By investing in advanced technology, sustainable practices, and market-driven solutions, we are not just strengthening our leadership position but also redefining the standards of excellence in the home textile industry.""
Live Events
Joshipura said the group is also undertaking certain de bottlenecking projects ""which would improve our capacity by another 20 per cent""
Commenting on the Indian market, which at present is very small for the group compared to developed markets such as US and Europe, he said, ""Domestic (market) and brand building remains our focus... India is going to become larger and larger and as an early mover would definitely have an advantage.""
He further said, ""There is a huge vacuum in terms of brand in the home textile segment today (in the Indian market). There are very few players... 'myTrident' is the leading player there, and we would keep focusing on it aggressively. We have created a very focused team which is purely dedicated to the India market.""
Currently, Trident's India business is at around Rs 500 crore annually, he said, adding ""but this is going to increase significantly"".
As part of enhancing its India business, 'myTrident' is increasing retail touch points from the current 7,000 to 10,000. It is eyeing growth in the East and South India, with plans to add 500 premium retail points by 2025.
It is also looking to tap opportunities in
HORECA
(hotel, restaurant, and Cafe/Catering) and institutions, to increase market share in these sectors.

"IIT Guwahati develops self-cleaning, flexible heating fabric",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/iit-guwahati-develops-self-cleaning-flexible-heating-fabric/articleshow/118221465.cms,13-02-2025,"Guwahati: Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati researchers have developed a water-repellent, conductive textile that converts electricity and sunlight into heat.
Designed to keep wearers warm in cold environments, this innovation addresses the serious health risks posed by prolonged exposure to very low temperatures, including haemoconcentration-based arterial blood clotting, breathing difficulties, and weakened immunity.
The findings of this research have been published in the journal, Nano-Micro-Small, in a paper co-authored by Prof. Uttam Manna, Department of Chemistry, IIT Guwahati, along with his research team, Debasmita Sarkar, Haydar Ali, Rajan Singh, Anirban Phukan, Chittaranjan Mishra, and Prof. Roy P. Paily from Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, IIT Guwahati.
Extreme cold temperatures can lead to health problems that can even be fatal. Studies indicate that deaths due to extreme cold outnumber those caused by extreme heat. Traditional solutions protect oneself from extreme cold, such as heaters or layered clothing are often bulky or require a constant power source. Conductive textiles offer a lightweight, flexible alternative, but existing versions often have limitations, such as poor durability, high power consumption, and vulnerability to water exposure.
To overcome these challenges, IIT Guwahati research team developed a novel approach by sprayed ultra-thin and clean silver nanowires onto cotton fabric to make it conductive. These nanowires are 100,000 times thinner than a human hair, allowing electricity to flow through the fabric, helping it generate heat while remaining soft and flexible. Due to its exceptional electrical conductivity and the ability to convert both electricity and sunlight into heat, silver nanowires were chosen for this experiment. The low electrical resistance of silver allows the electrothermal conversion at low applied voltage and eliminating the risk of electrocution.

One limitation with silver nanowires is that it can tarnish over time, affecting performance. To address this, researchers applied a water-repellent coating to the silver nanowires that protects against oxidation, water, and stains. The coating, inspired by lotus leaves, has a microscopic rough surface texture, which causes water to roll off instead of soaking in. This keeps the textile dry, ensuring long-lasting conductivity and effective heating, even in damp conditions. The water-repellent coating also prevents damage from sweat, rain, or accidental spills, making it reliable for outdoor and everyday applications.
The textile can convert electricity using a small rechargeable battery or solar energy into heat and can maintain a desired temperature between 40°C and 60°C for over 10 hours.
The researchers tested the textile in wearable knee and elbow bands, demonstrating its potential to provide sustained warmth for individuals working in cold environments and arthritis patients needing localized heat therapy. Additionally, the textile has broader applications, such as on-demand water heating and accelerating chemical reactions by wrapping it around the reaction vessels.
Speaking about the developed textile, Prof. Uttam Manna, said, “Our textile is self-cleanable, breathable, and flexible and can easily be scaled up. Its durability and long-lasting performance make it useful in a range of applications that require controlled heating.""
The research team has filed an Indian patent on the innovation and is now working towards integrating the developed material with a miniaturised and appropriate electronic circuit to create viable products. Additionally, the team is seeking industry collaborations to bring the innovation to market for potential dry thermos-therapy applications in the near future.

Global clothing brands looking up to India amid Bangladesh unrest,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/global-clothing-brands-looking-up-to-india-amid-bangladesh-unrest/articleshow/118148715.cms,11-02-2025,"Major global brands from the US and Europe such as JCPenney, Primark, Tesco, Decathlon, Duns, Kik Clothing, GAP and Next are engaging with Indian readymade garment manufacturers and suppliers in the wake of the Bangladesh crisis, Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary General, Apparel Export Promotion Councilsaid.
The
global clothing brands
are looking up to India in the midst of Bangladesh political unrest, resulting in surge in enquiries and export orders.
“The Bangladesh crisis has begun to have an impact on the global apparel sourcing contours. The current unrest is expected to disrupt the Bangladesh garment export infrastructure on account of a variety of reasons including the imminent forex crisis since their readymade garment exports is critically dependent on import of fabrics,” Thakur said.
In April-December FY25, India’s overall apparel exports were $11.31 billion, up 11.58% on-year.
In the face of political turmoil in Bangladesh, Indian exporters are benefiting from global orders shifting to India. Hubs like Tirupur are witnessing a surge in enquiries and export commitments, with shipments expected to ramp up in early 2025.

“This shift underscores India’s ability to step in as a trusted alternative sourcing destination amidst geopolitical uncertainties,” he said.
While the US and EU continue to remain India’s top export destinations, India is also making strides in other emerging markets. FTA markets like Japan, Korea, UAE and Mauritius have also started showing promise in recent months reflecting expansion of global footprint.
On product front, India’s apparel export portfolio has been traditionally dominated by cotton garments making Indian exports largely cotton centric. With global demand increasingly shifting towards man-made fibre (MMF) based garments on account of the versatility, durability and affordability of the fibre and its increasing use in formal, fashion and sportswear, India is finding itself lagging in this key segment, according to
Thakur.
This has also led to Indian exports not getting aligned with the global demand.
His statement comes ahead of India’s flagship
Bharat Tex event
on February 12-14.
He said the event is all about the entire textiles’ products however, RMG industry in particular will focus more on MMF based garment, sustainable clothing and innovative products which are increasingly in demand the world over.
“India is also relatively weak in lowers/ bottoms, outerwear, athleisure/ activewear where with little extra efforts we will be able to capture a significant market share,”
Thakur said.

While many new-age fashion brands focus on fast fashion trends. Dressfolk saw a gap in the market for Indian wear for people over 25 in the natural, handwoven fabrics space.
Besides its website, the brand has scaled its
distribution
through leading marketplaces such as Aza Fashions, Nykaa, and Myntra, while also hosting pop-ups across India.

“Our conviction in Dressfolk comes not only from their unique
business
model, which places Bharat and its artisanal heritage at the core, but also from their stellar team, led by Nitin, whose deep and contextual experience gives the company an edge over its peers,” said Dhruv Dhanraj Bahl, Managing Partner at Eternal Capital.
Having grown close to 200% in FY24, the brand collaborates with a network of over 800 weavers and 120 artisans across six states.
Dressfolk aims to take Indian handloom global by expanding into international markets through a brand-new international website.
Over the past decade, a shift from ready-to-stitch clothing to ready-to-wear along with the entry of national players like Fa India, BIBA, W, AND, Global Desi, etc. has propelled the growth in branded apparel helped by a significant shift away from traditional sarees towards ethnic wear and western wear.
In India, ethnic wear is the single biggest category in the women’s wear segment with a share of 71% despite global fashion brands such as Zara, H&M and Uniqlo pushing westernised clothing in their market.

NCLAT set aside penalty on lenders for delay in Mudra Denim insolvency process,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/nclat-set-aside-penalty-on-lenders-for-delay-in-mudra-denim-insolvency-process/articleshow/117580534.cms,26-01-2025,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
) has set aside the penalty imposed against lenders of debt-ridden
Mudra Denim
, saying there was no laxity on their part for delay in insolvency process. The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had, on November 11 last year, while deciding creditors' plea seeking extension of deadline to complete the
insolvency process
, imposed a cost of Rs 55,000 on the
Committee of Creditors
(COC).
This was challenged before NCLAT by COC through
IDBI Bank
, contending that there was not any laxity on the part of COC which decided to take Mudra Denim for liquidation on December 13, 2023, prior to the expiry of the CIRP (
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process
) period.
All facts could not be brought to the notice since the COC was not appearing before the NCLT, hence the imposition of cost was uncalled for, the lenders submitted.
Also, the company's resolution professional said that e-voting on the appointment of the liquidator was completed on January 5, 2024, and the application was moved on February 9, 2024.
Consenting to the arguments, a three-member NCLAT bench said there are facts which indicate that there was sufficient reason for filing the application on February 9, 2024, by the RP and COC which cannot be held responsible for committing a laxity.
Live Events
""We thus are satisfied that imposition of cost by the impugned order deserves to be set aside. We allow the appeal and delete the cost of Rs 55,000 imposed on COC,"" said NCLAT.
The Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) mandates to complete CIRP within 330 days, which includes time taken during litigations.
As per Section 12(1) of the Code, the CIRP shall be completed within a period of 180 days from the date of initiation.
However, NCLT may grant a one-time extension of 90 days. The maximum time within which CIRP must be mandatorily completed, including any extension or litigation period, is 330 days.

Shareholders reject key ESOP resolutions at Gokaldas Exports,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/shareholders-reject-key-esop-resolutions-at-gokaldas-exports/articleshow/117464899.cms,22-01-2025,"Shareholders of
Gokaldas Exports
voted against four special resolutions related to the company’s
employee stock ownership plans
(ESOPs), including a proposal to grant ESOPs exceeding 1% of equity to its managing director and vice chairperson,
Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi
.
Although 63% of participating shareholders supported the resolutions, 37% voted against them. As these were special resolutions, they required at least three times more votes in favor than against to pass.
The company proposed four resolutions: Employee Stock Option Plan 2024 (ESOP 2024), allowing the issuance of up to 2 million options, extension of
ESOP
2024 to employees of subsidiary companies, granting stock options exceeding 1% of issued capital to the managing director, and increasing the limits for loans, investments, and guarantees under Section 186 of the Companies Act, 2013, up to Rs 1,000 crore beyond regulatory thresholds.
Mumbai-based advisory firm
Institutional Investor Advisory Services
(IiAS) recommended voting against the ESOP-related resolutions, stating that such plans should benefit a broad base of employees rather than disproportionately favoring senior management.
“We believe ESOPs should motivate and reward a wider pool of employees, not just a small group at the top. Therefore, we do not support these resolutions,” IiAS noted.

Regarding the proposed increase in limits for loans, investments, and guarantees, IiAS advised the company to disclose granular details, including recipient companies, the size and nature of their operations, and terms of support, to enable shareholders to make informed decisions.

NITMA appeals to PM Modi to stop under-invoiced imports of synthetic knitted fabrics,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/nitma-appeals-to-pm-modi-to-stop-under-invoiced-imports-of-synthetic-knitted-fabrics/articleshow/117462671.cms,22-01-2025,"The
Northern India Textile Mills’ Association
(
NITMA

Prime Minister Narendra Modi
to stop
under-invoiced imports
of
synthetic knitted fabrics
that are causing irreversible damage to the
domestic textile industry
. According to the association, this has led to a loss of over Rs 10,000 ccore to the exchequer by evading both direct and indirect taxes.
The appeal made by Sidharth Khanna, president of NITMA comprised a list of importers affecting these under-priced fabrics, who are circumventing HS codes to import the fabric at a price of around $1 per kg whereas the true price ranges between $ 4-6/Kg globally.
The Central government, earlier this month, had extended the imposition of a
Minimum Import Price
(MIP) of US$ 3.50 per Kg on 13 specific HSN codes of synthetic knitted fabrics up to March 31, 2025.
Mr. Khanna informed despite the government’s efforts to curb these under-priced imports, the import quantities have been increasing substantially
instead of decreasing. From April -June 2024 81 million kg was imported while during the July - September period 130 million kgs were imported.

In 2024-25, the allocation for the textiles ministry was ₹4,417.03 crore. The extant allocation for the PLI scheme for technical textiles and man-made fibre (MMF) apparel and products is ₹45 crore and is expected to go up to ₹60 crore in FY26. Finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
will announce the budget for 2025-26 on February 1.
The government approved the PLI scheme for textiles in 2021 with an outlay of ₹10,683 crore over a five-year period to promote production of MMF apparel, MMF fabrics and products of technical textiles in the country to enable textiles industry to achieve size and scale and to become competitive.
""We have an ambitious target for the textiles industry and are looking at ways to encourage domestic manufacturing. Some measures could be announced in the budget,"" said an official.

India aims to achieve $600 billion of textiles exports by 2047 and expansion of the domestic market to $1.8 trillion from $110 billion in 2022. India's textiles exports in April-December FY25 were $26.6 billion.
However, the country depends on imports of textiles machinery such as auto-corners, winders and fancy doublers for spinning and knitting machines to make garments, and the industry has sought a scheme to enable local machine manufacturing. ""To support the industry, the government may come up with a scheme providing an interest subsidy at 7% for at least 10 years to enable the manufacturer to settle down,"" said Rakesh Mehra, chairman, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry.
Similarly, spun lace, spun bond, mask, special fibres braiding needle punch multi-axial looms and net knitting for technical textiles along with machines for synthetic dyeing used in processing are also currently imported.

Sammir Dattani
’s hands are full. The 40-year-old Mumbaikar, popular with Kannada movie fans as Dhyan after starring in hits like Nanna Preethiya Hudugi and Amruthadhare, is not pursuing movie projects anymore. He has, instead, been busy with
Sanathan Textiles
, the Mumbai-based yarn maker that had a successful stock market debut in December.
“I come from a business family, so it has always been in my blood,” says the actor who was active in Hindi, Kannada and Tamil films for about a decade. Modelling was his other calling.
The Dattani brothers -- Mikesh and Varun being the other two -- are second-generation shareholders of the business their father and uncles founded 19 years ago. The company has raised Rs 400 crore from the
IPO
to clear part of the debt and grow the business.
“My key focus areas are raw material procurement for the
polyester filament yarn
division,” says Dattani, who also oversees marketing and branding for the company. The company operates verticals for polyester filament yarn, cotton yarn and technical yarn, and exports to 29 countries.
The company’s current manufacturing capacity is in Silvassa with a capacity of 2,23,000 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) across the three yarn divisions. “We are setting up our new manufacturing facility in Punjab, and the location is one hour from Chandigarh (Mohali) airport,” says Dattani.

This facility is expected to start production in the Apr-Jun quarter and will make polyester filament yarns for the North India market. The phase one capacity will be 2,55,000 MTPA and, in phase two, it will go up by 91,000 MTPA.
“We have many customers in North India who have been buying polyester filament yarn for more than a decade. They have always been buying from Silvassa or Gujarat, and now we will be the first local manufacturer of polyester filament yarn in North India.” As for South India, where Dhyan was active as an actor for a decade, he says, “We have a sales office in Tirupur and a sales team there…South is a growing market, and Jacquard Fabrics, Technosport and Page Industries are some of our regular customers in south India.”

Apparel exports up 11.6 pc in Apr-Dec: AEPC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-exports-up-11-6-pc-in-apr-dec-aepc/articleshow/117300343.cms,16-01-2025,"The country's

AEPC

The
Apparel Export Promotion Council
(AEPC) said this is the appropriate time when India needs to capitalise the growing opportunity and accelerate the momentum to expand its global footprints and enter new markets.
AEPC Chairman Sudhir Sekhri said, ""Apparel exports have been registering a robust growth for the last six months despite global turmoil and subdued demand from major markets"".
The long-term outlook for Indian apparel exports remains positive, largely on account of improved product acceptance, adaptability to changing consumer trends, focus of factories on compliance besides industry-friendly policies, the chairman said.
Sekhri added that the exports rose mainly to the US, the UK, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Japan, Australia, and Mauritius.

"India Ratings and Research upgrades outlook for retail apparel sector, forecasts recovery in FY2025-26",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/india-ratings-and-research-upgrades-outlook-for-retail-apparel-sector-forecasts-recovery-in-fy2025-26/articleshow/117269949.cms,15-01-2025,"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has assigned an improving outlook for the
retail apparel sector
for FY25 and FY26. The industry witnessed lower store additions and negative same-store sales growth (SSSG) in 1HFY25, resulting in a moderation in revenue growth.
The lower growth is owing to tepid consumption demand and a high base effect due to revenge shopping post-COVID-19. However, a recovery is expected in 2HFY25 and FY26, given (a) improved consumer financial health, led by an increase in the income levels and lower inflation which would result in a higher disposable income, (b) a higher number of auspicious days for weddings (2.5x in 2H vs 1H) resulting in a higher clothing demand, and (c) the favourable monsoons driving demand in Tier-2 cities and beyond.
The growth across industry players has not been uniform, with divergent trends seen across various segments in the industry as well as different players within the segment, with organised players largely outperforming small unorganised players.
Ind-Ra believes certain segments will outperform the broader apparel industry, such as fast fashion, on the back of social media influence and GenZ preference (major retailer’s fast fashion format store count to double in FY25), e-commerce channels, on the back of increasing penetration of internet/smartphone, luxury, due to rising consumer aspiration and affluence, and ethnic, value and Tier-2 and beyond segment, due to the shift of customers to the organised industry.
Ind-Ra expects the EBITDA margin across the apparel retail space to remain flat in FY25, followed by a moderate improvement in FY26, due to the benefits of cost optimisation measures. The agency believes that controlled capex and steady profitability will keep the credit metrics at comfortable levels in FY25, with an improvement expected in FY26.
Live Events
“The tepid consumption demand and high base effect have impacted the growth of the apparel
retail industry
over the past few quarters. However, we expect a recovery in revenue growth over 2HFY25/FY26, on the back of improving consumer financial health, a higher number of wedding days and favourable monsoons.
Organised retailers’ steps to rationalise stores, undertake controlled expansion coupled with a focus on segments with relative outperformance such as fast fashion, luxury and ethnic fashion will support their credit profiles,” says Adarsh Gutha, Associate Director, Corporate Ratings, Ind-Ra.
Rationalisation of non-performing stores and right sizing stores to improve store productivity led to moderate growth in retail area of less than 9% yoy in 1HFY25 compared to around 12% yoy growth in FY24 for the Ind-Ra sample set.
Ind-Ra estimates the pace of store addition will be slow, with the retail area growing by 9% yoy in FY25 and by 11% yoy in FY26 for the Ind-Ra sample set. The expansion trend is expected to be driven by a greater quantum of store additions in fast fashion and ethnic-focused store formats.
In addition, there has been a growing trend of direct-to-consumer brands opening brick and mortar (B&M) stores and established retailers expanding in the under-penetrated Tier-2 and beyond markets. Additionally, retailers’ focus is expected towards scalable franchisee models to ensure optimal use of capex, working capital and management bandwidth.
The steep growth differential between e-commerce and B&M witnessed post-COVID-19 is tapering off. Ind-Ra estimates the e-commerce segment in apparel retail to grow around 17% yoy in FY25 and at a 15% CAGR till FY30 (2x of FY25 sales), and the B&M segment to grow by 7% yoy and at a 9% CAGR (although lower than e-commerce).
Physical retail is expected to continue to be relevant, given the desire for in-person experience and the necessity to touch and feel products especially expensive ones and customers wanting to have in-store experience with multiple product availability.
The apparel industry experienced challenging demand conditions over FY24-1HFY25, with green shoots in select sectors such as fast fashion, ethnic and luxury driving the growth.
Ind-Ra opines that Gen-Z customers would be the main driving force for self-consumption as they are frequent purchasers seeking newer trends at affordable prices, shifting away from traditional media and turning to influencers for inspiration.
Furthermore, the aspirational middle and upper-class consumers’ ability to spend on luxury items has been on a gradual uptrend and the same is expected to continue over the medium term, due to the easing of inflation and rising real wages.
The casualisation of clothing has increased the preference for casual/athleisure, with ethnic-celebration wear also expected to perform well, given the largely under-penetrated unorganised nature of the industry.
Fast fashion is benefitting from social media influence and customer demand for trendy clothing at short turnaround times. This can be seen with various large retail players increasing their number of stores in the fast fashion category which is expected to grow by 2x in FY25 and similar growth is expected in FY26.
Direct-to-consumer brands with strong online customer bases are exploring offline retail to ensure smooth integration across various channels. Prioritising a consistent and integrated approach across all platforms, while catering to affluent consumers with a strong omni-channel strategy, should remain a prime focus area for retailers looking for expansion. The ultra-value segment has also been growing at a healthy rate, owing to a greater shift from unorganised to organised.
Ind-Ra expects the revenue growth to moderate from 9.5% in FY24 to 8.5% in FY25 before reaching 10.5% in FY26 for the Ind-Ra sample set. While SSSG is expected to be marginally negative in FY25, with improvement in FY26, revenues from new store additions are likely to drive growth.
In 1HFY25, revenue growth for the Ind-Ra sample set fell to nearly 7% yoy (FY24: 9%), led by subdued consumer sentiments, negative SSSG and a drop in volumes owing to the shift of festive demand to 2H, which is expected to revive in 2H.
Despite the decline in SSSG and subdued demand, which constrained pricing, the EBITDA margins are expected to remain protected at 16.5% in FY25, owing to the cost optimisation measures adopted by the companies.
Advertising and promotional spending trends have been a mixed bag, with some retailers investing heavily in promotional and discounting activity to attract consumers, while others opting to reduce theirs. Ind-Ra expects it to be maintained between 2.5%-3.0%.
Ind-Ra expects EBITDA margins across the apparel retail space to grow by nearly 30bp yoy in FY26, as retailers continue seeking opportunities to improve their efficiency through cost optimisation. However, given that inventory holdings come at a cost and impact return indicators, choosing an optimal mix and adequate quantities (based on stock movement) is essential to ensure efficient inventory turns.
While there will be a slight dip of 4% yoy in the inventory days in FY25, Ind-Ra expects them to remain elevated until FY26, owing to the controlled expansion plans and retailers’ focus on a shorter cycle fast fashion segment. Ind-Ra believes steady profitability and controlled capex will support the capital structure and keep the credit metrics at comfortable levels in FY25, with improvement expected in FY26.

The spinning wheel was not just a source of employment but also an integral part of the national movement, the chief minister added.
Adityanath highlighted how Khadi has evolved from manual spinning wheels to modern solar and electric variants, emphasising its continued relevance in society today.
He lauded the success of the One District One Product (ODOP) scheme, calling it the pride of Uttar Pradesh. He noted how each district's signature product has gained not only national but international recognition.
The chief minister highlighted how Uttar Pradesh has effectively implemented Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Vocal for Local"" initiative, empowering the local economy while encouraging handicrafts and entrepreneurship.
He also praised the diverse craftsmanship of various districts, especially in textiles and handicrafts.
Adityanath emphasised the state government's efforts in ensuring market access for Khadi, clay art, and other indigenous products.
Calling it a ""chain of self-reliance"", he proudly said the Khadi sector alone has generated employment for over 3.5 lakh people in the past seven years.
He also stressed the growing preference for indigenous products during festivals, replacing foreign goods.
The chief minister pointed out how in the past, festivals were celebrated with imported goods, including hazardous products from China, which even caused health issues among children.
He said that local products not only offer a safer alternative but also create job opportunities and contribute to India's economic growth.
Describing the Khadi Mahotsav as a significant platform, Adityanath stated that the festival offers artists, weavers, and entrepreneurs an opportunity to showcase their skills and learn new techniques.
He highlighted that the event not only promotes Khadi and Village Industries but also brings together artists and entrepreneurs from across the country.
Referring to the growing global demand for Khadi, the chief minister described it as a symbol of India's cultural heritage.

Govt fixes 8.19% 'return on capital' for jute bag supplies for foodgrain packaging,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/govt-fixes-8-19-return-on-capital-for-jute-bag-supplies-for-foodgrain-packaging/articleshow/116988730.cms,06-01-2025,"Indian jute mills will earn an 8.19-per cent ""
return on capital
"" for supplying jute bags for foodgrain packaging under the newly approved pricing framework by the
Ministry of Textiles
, a senior official said. This implies that mills will earn the predetermined percentage of profit on the capital invested, regardless of market fluctuations of input costs, he said.
According to the
Indian Jute Mills Association
, the new pricing formula will result in only a 4-5 per cent increase in the price of gunny sack supplies.
In contrast, the Office of the Jute Commissioner estimates the pricing benefit to be between 6 per cent and 8 per cent, considering various other modifications made in the new pricing policy following the Tariff Commission recommendations.
The new pricing formula will be applied retrospectively from September 2016.
""The total benefit impact from the current price revision in sacking bags to mills is estimated to be anywhere between 6-8 per cent, taking into account all aspects of the pricing mechanism,"" Jute Commissioner Moloy Chandan Chakrabortty told PTI.
Live Events
""The return on capital has shifted to a revised norm of 8.19 per cent under the new framework. Additionally, there have been changes in the return policy, all of which favour the mills,"" Chakrabortty said.
Raghavendra Gupta of the Indian Jute Mills Association said the pricing is dynamic with a lot of variables, and it will depend on several factors, including raw jute prices.
However, the pricing revamp will benefit the mills in the range of 4-5 per cent, he said.
Union Textiles Minister Giriraj Singh, during a recent visit to Kolkata, had said the new pricing will also benefit other stakeholders - around 4 lakh jute mill workers and 40 lakh farmer families engaged in its cultivation - primarily in West Bengal.
He had also said this year's sale of jute products is expected to cross Rs 14,000 crore.
Singh adviced the mills about reducing their dependence on government supplies, and exploring new avenues driven by value addition through innovation and modernisation efforts.
He had said that with coordinated efforts of all stakeholders like the government, mills, workers and farmers, the goal is to increase the value of finished jute goods from about Rs 1,15,000 per tonne to Rs 2 lakh per tonne in the near future.
This value accretion, however, does not apply to government gunny sack supplies, an official clarified.
The textiles ministry has been constantly investing in research and development in the life cycle of the golden fibre towards this goal, he said.

Apparel exporters seek tax incentives in Budget to boost shipments,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-exporters-seek-tax-incentives-in-budget-to-boost-shipments/articleshow/116939646.cms,04-01-2025,"Apparel exporters
body AEPC on Saturday urged the government to announce
tax incentives
, including removal of a provision requiring payments to MSMEs within 45 days to claim deductions and customs duty exemption on garment machinery imports. The Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) has also requested that an interest equalization rate of 5 per cent be announced in the Budget, scheduled to be unveiled on February 1 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
Other demands include extension of concessional tax rate for new manufacturing units to encourage setting up of new garment units; simplification in the procedure of imports of trims and embellishments under IGCR (Import of Goods at Concessional Rate); and liberalizing e-commerce export procedures.
""Ready Made Garments (RMG) industry has also demanded removal of Sec43B (H) of IT Act in the ensuing Budget which pertains to payment to any MSME companies within a maximum 45 days' time to claim any deduction in tax. This has increased tax liabilities and has disrupted the cash flow of exporters,"" it said in a statement.
It added that the cap per consignment of export value under e-commerce should be increased to minimum Rs 25 lakh and export realization period should be extended to 12 months.
India's garment export sector relies heavily on imported machinery to maintain quality and global competitiveness, as domestic production is insufficient to meet demand.

""High import duties make Indian garments exports less competitive vis-a-vis countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. AEPC recommends not only continuing existing exemptions but also reducing the customs duty to zero on remaining garmenting machinery to enhance the sector's efficiency,"" it said.
AEPC Chairman Sudhir Sekhri said, ""The Union Budget is a great opportunity where our demands for long-term policy support can be considered.""
AEPC Secretary General Mithileshwar Thakur said there is an urgent need to quickly adopt right strategies to take advantage of evolving supply chain reorientation.
""The Indian apparel sector is on a high growth trajectory and has the potential to outpace global competitors with upscaling of production capacity, channelizing investments into the sector, upskilling of workforce and labour reforms,"" Thakur said.

Textile industry body seeks schemes to help achieve $100 billion export target by 2030,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/textile-industry-body-seeks-schemes-to-help-achieve-100-billion-export-target-by-2030/articleshow/116797123.cms,30-12-2024,"The Confederation of Indian
Textile Industry
(
CITI
) has urged the government to introduce schemes to drive investment and scale in the
textile
and apparel (T&A) industry to boost exports towards the US$100 billion target by 2030.
Ministry of Textiles has set an ambitious target of achieving US$ 100 billion in textile and apparel exports by 2030. Markets like USA and EU will play a key role in achieving this ambitious target. Hence, there is a dire need for the government to develop various export promotion initiatives to boost textile and apparel exports in these markets.
The Chairman of CITI Rakesh Mehra said, ""USA accounts for about 27% of India’s T&A exports. During the last 5 years, India’s exports to the USA have increased at a CAGR of about 3.3%. It would require our exports to grow at a CAGR of about 16% to achieve the visionary target of US$ 100 bn exports by 2030.”
Mehra highlighted the potential opportunities arising from the recent political changes in the USA. “Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the USA is likely to announce additional tariffs on Chinese products as one of his initial measures upon taking office. Since China is a major supplier of T&A products to the USA, this tariff shift presents a unique opportunity for India to expand its share in the US market,” he said.
To capitalize on this opportunity, Mehra emphasized the need for strategic marketing initiatives, including trade exhibitions, buyer-seller meetings, and partnerships with US retailer associations. “Enhancing our visibility and presence in the US market through these targeted efforts will be crucial for tapping into this potential,” he added. In addition to the marketing efforts, CITI called for the continuation of schemes like the Interest Equalization Scheme (IES), and RoDTEP schemes for AA/SEZ and EoU units beyond 31st December 2024 to ensure cost competitiveness of the Indian T&A products.

Furthermore, income-tax relief for MSME manufacturing units was stressed to ensure sustainable growth within the textile sector. “These policy interventions, combined with focused initiatives aimed at key export markets like the USA, will strengthen India’s overall export strategy and enhance the global competitiveness of the Indian textile industry,” Mehra concluded.

extreme heat
as climate change pushes temperatures up, a report found on Sunday, a problem multinational retailers and brands will have to help address.
New European Union regulations make retailers selling in the bloc, like Inditex, H&M and Nike, legally liable for conditions at their suppliers, putting pressure on them to help fund improvements to cool factories they source from.
In Dhaka, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Penh and Karachi, the number of days with ""wet-bulb"" temperatures - a measurement that accounts for air temperature as well as humidity - above 30.5 degrees Celsius jumped by 42% in 2020-2024 compared to 2005-2009, researchers at Cornell University's Global Labor Institute found.
Above that threshold, the International Labor Organisation recommends as much rest as work in any given hour to maintain safe core body temperature levels.
The report identified only three retailers - Nike, Levi's, and VF Corp - which specifically include protocols to protect workers from heat exhaustion in their supplier codes of conduct.

COMPANIES WARNED
""We've been talking to brands for ages now about this issue, and they're only now starting to turn their attention to it,"" Jason Judd, executive director at Cornell University's Global Labor Institute, told Reuters.
""If a brand or retailer knows that temperatures in a production area are excessively high or doing damage to worker health, then they're obligated under this new set of rules to do something about it,"" he added.
The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive came into force in July and will start applying to large companies from mid-2027.
Fixes to cool factories could include better ventilation and water evaporative cooling systems, instead of energy-intensive and expensive air conditioning that would increase manufacturers' carbon emissions.
Some factory owners would likely be willing to make such investments themselves, given how heat stress significantly impacts productivity, Judd said, but the EU rules highlight brands' responsibility to address the issue too.
The report also urged retailers and brands to invest in higher wages and health protections so that workers can manage the risk of missing work days due to heatwaves.
Extreme heat and flooding could erase $65 billion in apparel export earnings from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan and Vietnam by 2030, research from asset manager Schroders and the Global Labor Institute found last year.

Surat’s garment sector set to grow 20-25% as global brands seek stability away from Bangladesh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/surats-garment-sector-set-to-grow-20-25-as-global-brands-seek-stability-away-from-bangladesh/articleshow/116085226.cms,08-12-2024,"Gandhinagar: Many brands, both global and local, that were procuring garments from Bangladesh are now looking at Indian manufacturers to meet their demand, as they grow increasingly uncomfortable with continuing instability in the neighbouring country.
Textile industry insiders in Surat said they are getting enquiries for the production and supply of ready-to-wear garments from such brands. If these materialise into orders, they estimate the growth of Surat's garment sector could accelerate to 20-25%, from the current 12% a year. Textile hubs in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Noida too could benefit from new orders, they said.
While Bangladesh is the second-largest exporter of
ready-made garments
behind China, it is highly dependent on the fabric supplied from Surat, the textile city of India. As big brands are looking for alternative sources amid increasing political instability and law and order issues, as well as unrest among textile industry workers, in Bangladesh, Indian companies see it as an opportunity to supply more value-added products to global markets.
""Essentially, Surat's garment sector has been producing ethnic wear, kurtis and low-priced women's wear and some denim,"" said Ashish Gujarati, a former president of the South Gujarat Chamber of Commerce. ""There has been a significant spurt in enquiries by the big brands after trouble started in Bangladesh, which would certainly benefit the sector majorly.""
Live Events
Govt Assistance
Surat currently has a monthly turnover of about ₹600 crore. While it largely deals in man-made fibre, the cotton hubs in Tiruppur and Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, Ludhiana in Punjab and Noida in Uttar Pradesh are also expected to reap the benefits of the developments in the neighbouring country, he said.
“While we shall see some gains in the short term, if the situation is capitalised well, we should be able to grow significantly in the garment manufacturing sector,” said Gujarati. “But that would also call for some assistance from the government.”
The garment sector in Bangladesh has already been under pressure and the country has reported unrest among workers due to financial stress. Clusters in that country are located around Dhaka, Chittagong, Gazipur, Ashulia, Narayanganj, Khulna, Narsingdi and Rajshahi. Dhaka and Chittagong have been facing major unrest, while trouble has been reported from other areas as well.
In November, Swedwatch, a Swedish non-profit organisation reporting on business relations in developing countries, published a scathing report on the garment workers’ plight in Bangladesh. It asked European Union members to enforce stricter diligence to ensure the protection of workers’ rights.
The organisation also recommended
global brands sourcing garments
from Bangladesh to “avoid contractual cascading or seeking blanket assurances from suppliers, but instead invest in meaningful stakeholder engagement when identifying potential and actual impacts and developing corrective action plans”.
It suggested brands join hands with trade unions for the betterment of workers, including targeted training programmes. These are expected to ensure better working conditions and fair wages for textile workers.

"CITI warns of job losses, economic impact from proposed GST hike on garments",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/citi-warns-of-job-losses-economic-impact-from-proposed-gst-hike-on-garments/articleshow/116014045.cms,05-12-2024,"The
Confederation of Indian Textile Industry
(CITI) has raised concerns over the proposed GST rate revisions on ready-made garments, warning of potential far-reaching impacts on the textile industry, employment, and the overall economy.
Under the proposed framework, garments priced up to Rs 1,500 will continue to attract a 5% GST rate. However, garments priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 10,000 will face a steep increase to 18%, and those priced above Rs10,000 will fall under the highest tax slab of 28%.
The textile industry, already facing economic strain, stands to lose up several jobs, particularly in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) involved in spinning, weaving, and garment manufacturing.
The proposed GST hike is expected to heighten price inflation, disproportionately affecting price-sensitive consumers. CITI has urged the government to reconsider the proposed GST rate hike and adopt a balanced approach that fosters growth in the textile sector while ensuring consumer affordability.
""Higher taxes on garments tied to celebrations and festivals will slow down consumption at a time when demand is already under pressure. This could have a ripple effect on the economy, and the textile sector is a cornerstone of India’s economy, providing livelihoods to millions. Policies must nurture its growth rather than create hurdles,"" said Rakesh Mehra, Chairman, CITI.

Apparel industry slams proposed GST hike,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-industry-slams-proposed-gst-hike/articleshow/116006329.cms,05-12-2024,"The
apparel industry
has expressed serious concerns over the proposed
GST
rate hike recommended by the Group of Ministers (GoM) on rate rationalisation. Under the new tax structure, garments priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 10,000 would be taxed at 18 per cent, while apparel above Rs 10,000 would fall under the highest GST slab of 28 per cent. The rate for apparel priced up to Rs 1,500 would remain at 5 per cent.
The Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI) has urged the government to reconsider the hike, warning that it could lead to reduced consumer demand, widespread job losses, and disruptions in the industry's value chain.
The association emphasised the need for government policies that support the growth and stability of the industry, advocating a balanced approach to ensure long-term sustainability and benefits for all stakeholders.
""The proposed GST rate hike risks severely disrupting the formal retail sector by pushing both consumers and businesses toward informal channels. This shift would hurt legitimate retailers and potentially benefit unscrupulous sellers and illegal merchants. The textile industry, already under strain, could face job losses of up to one lakh,"" CMAI said in a statement.

The CMAI further suggested that a uniform GST rate of 5 per cent would be more practical and beneficial for the industry, urging the government to at least maintain continuity in the existing rates.
""The proposed GST rate revisions pose a significant threat to the apparel industry as a whole, which is already facing challenges such as declining consumer demand, profit erosion, and working capital issues. If implemented, it could lead to the closure of MSMEs in our sector, further destabilising an industry that plays a vital role in employment and economic growth,"" CMAI president Santosh Katariya said.
Katariya also questioned the rationale behind taxing clothing priced over Rs 10,000 at 28 per cent while mobile phones priced up to Rs 1.5 lakh are taxed at 18 per cent.
Industry stakeholders fear that the increased tax burden could further erode profit margins and intensify job losses.

Hosiery sector revenue set for 10-12% growth in FY24: CRISIL,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/hosiery-sector-revenue-set-for-10-12-growth-in-fy24-crisil/articleshow/116002399.cms,05-12-2024,"A
CRISIL Ratings
analysis of 30 hosiery makers, accounting for a third of the industry by revenue, has indicated that the revenue of
Indian hosiery makers
is expected to increase 10-12% on-year this fiscal following a revival in rural demand, volume support from the export market and robust
modern trade sales
.
The volume growth will more than offset a 1-2% on-year decline in average sales realisation because of a drop in selling prices to clear year-end inventory after demand from channel partners slackened.The industry’s operating margin is expected to improve 150-200 basis points (bps) this fiscal, owing to softer input prices and improved capacity utilisation, aided by higher volume growth.
Says Argha Chanda, Director, CRISIL Ratings “The revenue growth of 10-12% will ride on higher contribution of rural sales, which account for almost half the domestic revenue. Increase in agricultural yield following an above-normal monsoon, hike in the minimum support price and higher government spending on rural infrastructure will support rural spending. Increase in exports to the Middle East and North Africa along with expected growth in urban demand led by growing modern trade will also improve volume growth.”
The hosiery industry typically sees a spike in volume by year-end as channel partners start stocking to meet high demand during the summer season. However, year-end sales last fiscal were impacted by lower stocking in anticipation of a fall in average product realisation amid consistently falling yarn prices. That said, stability in yarn prices this fiscal and 1-2% dip in selling prices have led to a resurgence in demand from channel partners.
Amid strong demand from channel partners, hosiery manufacturers will curtail their spending on advertising and marketing. Also, operating leverage will increase amid higher capacity utilisation. The upshot is that the operating margin of hosiery manufacturers rated by CRISIL Ratings should widen 150-200 bps to 11.5-12% this fiscal, driving up cash accruals.
Live Events
Higher cash accruals and reduced inventory holding periods are expected to lower the working capital requirement and strengthen the liquidity profile of players. Also, capacity utilisation continues to be moderate and no major expansion is expected. This should limit long-term borrowings and finance costs.
Says Vishnu Sinha, Team Leader, CRISIL Ratings, “Inventory holding is expected to fall to a historical low of 90-100 days this fiscal from 150 days in fiscal 2024. Accordingly, moderation in working capital requirement and no major debt-funded capital expenditure should keep debt levels in check. The ratio of total outside liabilities to tangible networth is forecast to remain below 1 time, consistent with last fiscal. The improved operating performance of hosiery makers will improve interest coverage to ~6.5 times this fiscal from 4.5 times last fiscal.”
However, the impact of inflation and sustenance of farm incomes are key aspects of the rural economy that will bear watching. Export growth and dynamics within the modern trade segment will also need to be monitored as they play a crucial part in achieving higher-than-expected volume and margin growth.

Tirupur’s textile industry sees resurgence as US & UK orders surge amid Bangladesh instability,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/tirupurs-textile-industry-sees-resurgence-as-us-uk-orders-surge-amid-bangladesh-instability/articleshow/115681116.cms,26-11-2024,"India’s textile hub of Tirupur is facing a revival of fortunes after nearly two years with a flurry of orders from the US and UK, helped also by political instability in neighbouring Bangladesh. With this, the city’s 5,000 apparel export units are buzzing with activity with their factories operating at 95% capacity.
K M Subramanian, president of Tirupur Exporters Association (TEA) said new apparel buyers from the UK are seeking samples in anticipation that a much-awaited Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will be signed soon between India and the UK. Last week, the Union commerce ministry said talks on the FTA will resume early next year.
“The units are getting orders from the US for the upcoming Spring season. A few months ago, the units were operating at 60-65% capacity. But that has changed now,” said Subramanian.
He said some US-based companies who were earlier sourcing from Bangladesh are now tapping Indian suppliers.
“In FY24, Tirupur had clocked a revenue of Rs 35,000 crore which is likely to increase to Rs 40,000 crore in FY25,” he added.

India’s
apparel exports
surged by 35% in October to $1.22 billion from $908.78 million a year earlier, as per the commerce ministry.
Punit Lalbhai, vice chairman and executive director of textile maker
Arvind Ltd
, said during the company’s Q2 earnings call, “As far as garments go, currently, anybody who is a credible garment player, who has capacities, will be full because the demand scenario is pretty good. And India is a preferred location, where people want to diversify their sourcing metrics, too. So, that explains why everybody has good visibility and a good order book.”
The US had significantly reduced garment imports after the pandemic. “The US pipeline of garments is shallow, and they are putting in fresh orders. Some orders are coming from Bangladesh too because of the ongoing political unrest,” said Sanjay Jain, chairman of the Indian Chamber of Commerce National Committee on Textiles. “We are expecting to achieve around $18.5-$19 billion of apparel exports in FY25 from $16 billion in FY24 and the growth momentum will continue for at least two years in the near term,” he said.
Sudhir Dhingra, owner of Gurugram-based exporter Orient Craft noted that even though orders meant for Bangladesh are being diverted to India, many Indian textile makers do not have the necessary infrastructure to handle large orders.
“The big ones will be able to take orders. But the smaller ones, which are large in numbers, may not be able to do so. The opportunity from Bangladesh is huge, and the Indian apparel industry can leverage it only if the government gives incentives like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for garment manufacturing units and banks come forward to give working capital loans to the smaller units,” he said.
In the earnings call, Lalbhai had said “Vietnam and Bangladesh were already approaching saturation as (it was a case of) too many eggs in one basket for many customers. I think from that perspective, this unrest in Bangladesh only reinforces the need to have more sourcing locations. And India ticks a lot of boxes amongst the future candidates for further diversification.”
Commenting on the India-UK FTA in an earnings call recently, Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi, vice chairman and managing director,
Gokaldas Exports
had said, “And it is positive, definitely more positive for me, because we already are working with some UK-based clients in anticipation, and they will only increase their sourcing. But regardless of that, I am seeing that, with problems in Bangladesh, I am finding even UK-based customers who currently enjoy a 12% delta in import duty between India and Bangladesh because Bangladesh goes duty-free are looking at outsourcing more from India. So, we are seeing traction coming from there which will only accelerate if the FTA happens.”
“US apparel imports are now trending up over the previous year. After a major period of excess inventory, which the brands were consciously trying to liquidate, inventory holdings have reached a low level and brands have started purchasing again,"" said Ganapathi.

Expect Indian apparel exporters to post 9-11 pc revenue growth in FY25: ICRA,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/expect-indian-apparel-exporters-to-post-9-11-pc-revenue-growth-in-fy25-icra/articleshow/114421074.cms,21-10-2024,"Indian apparel exporters
are expected to register a 9-11 per cent revenue expansion in FY25 aided primarily by gradual liquidation of
retail inventory
in key end markets and a shift in global sourcing to India, ratings agency
ICRA
on Monday.
The long-term prospects for Indian
apparel
exports are favourable, aided by enhanced product acceptance in end markets, evolving consumer trends and a boost from the government in the form of the
production-linked incentive
(PLI) scheme, export incentives, the proposed free trade agreement with the UK and the EU, among others, ICRA said in a statement.
The expected growth this fiscal follows a tepid performance in FY24 when exports were affected because of high retail inventory, sluggish demand from the key end markets, supply chain issues, including the Red Sea crisis and heightened competition from neighbouring countries, it added.
With the revival in demand, ICRA said it expects the capex spending to increase in FY2025 and FY2026 and may stay in the range of 5-8 per cent of the turnover.
""After a marginal decline (down 2 per cent) in FY24, Indian apparel exporters are estimated to report a 9-11 per cent revenue growth in FY25, benefitting from de-risking strategy adopted by various customers and replenishment of retail inventory in key end markets, especially the US and the EU regions,"" ICRA Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head Corporate Ratings Srikumar Krishnamurthy said.

Nevertheless, he said challenges around demand uncertainty persist in a few key markets amid a subdued macroeconomic environment and geopolitical issues.
""Despite the revenue growth, associated operating leverage benefits and softer raw material prices, the industry's operating margins are expected to contract by 30-50 bps on a YoY basis in FY25 with increasing labour costs, freight costs and rise in other operating expenses,"" Krishnamurthy added.
ICRA said the recent geo-political tensions in Bangladesh could result in capacity additions outside the country, including India.
Yet, availability of labour at competitive costs and preferential duty access, given its least developed country status for another two years on exports to the US and the EU help Bangladesh to remain competitive against most other developing countries, it added.
""Apart from the benefits to be derived from the fresh capacity additions under the PLI scheme, PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel scheme is expected to strengthen India's presence in the global apparel trade by providing scale benefits and strengthening the country's presence in the man-made fibre value chain,"" Srikumar said.
ICRA anticipates the culmination of these schemes to enable Indian apparel exporters to increase their share of the pie in the global apparel trade, he added.

India gains momentum in US apparel market as crisis in Bangladesh continues,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/india-gains-momentum-in-us-apparel-market-amid-challenges-in-global-supply-chains/articleshow/114419427.cms,21-10-2024,"Amid growing concerns about the
garment sector
in Bangladesh, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) has highlighted India’s rising credibility as a preferred apparel sourcing destination. American buyers cite political stability in India as a key advantage, allowing brands to trust in smooth production and delivery processes.
""Brands are more willing to source high-value or fashion items from India compared to less politically stable countries, as they are confident they will be able to produce and receive their products,"" the ITC report noted. Indian industry insiders are optimistic, expecting an increase in orders. Presently, around 80% of production in India caters to the domestic market.
While the report recognizes India’s competitiveness—particularly in cotton-based garments—it also highlights operational challenges. High labor costs, small production units, and expensive logistics pose limitations for the sector's scalability. Additionally, India’s limited capacity in manufacturing man-made fiber (MMF) products restricts further growth, as some brands view the country as more specialized in
cotton garments
.
The ITC profiled India along with other key garment exporters such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Cambodia. These countries, along with Vietnam, gained market share from China over the past decade. Notably, China’s share in
US apparel imports
fell from 37.7% in 2013 to 21.3% in 2023. During the same period, India’s share increased from 4% to 5.8%, with exports totaling $4.6 billion last year, making the US India's largest market for apparel exports. Vietnam emerged as the biggest beneficiary, boosting its share to 17.8% from 10% over the last decade.
The ITC emphasized India's strengths in vertical integration, particularly in the cotton garment segment, due to the availability of most inputs domestically. This comprehensive value chain integration enhances India’s appeal as a reliable supplier.
Live Events
Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary General of the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), welcomed the ITC's recognition of India’s strengths beyond cost efficiency. “Indian textile and apparel industry has long been a victim of negative perception. The
USITC
study has busted this myth by projecting the Indian apparel industry as one specializing in high value-added products, requiring high-skill levels and with the highest degree of reliability,"" Thakur told TOI. He also appreciated that the ITC assessed factors such as supply chain reliability and product differentiation, rather than focusing solely on cost.
With one-third of India’s apparel exports heading to the US, the country is positioned as the fourth-largest supplier to the American market. However, addressing challenges related to labor costs, production capacity, and MMF products will be crucial for sustaining and expanding this momentum.
India’s apparel industry is eager to capitalize on its strengths, hoping to increase market share and cement its reputation as a reliable, high-quality supplier amid evolving global trade dynamics.

""It will not be an exaggeration to say that the entire world has started looking at India as a preferred sourcing destination,"" Thakur said.

The charge sheet said that Palghar-based Mandhana Industries is into manufacturing and trading of textiles since the 1990s. It owns other firms, namely,
Mahan Synthetic Textiles Private Limited
,
Balaji Corporation
, Golden Seam Industries Private Limited and Dhumketu Finvest Private Limited, but no business was undertaken in them.
The group availed of 21 loans from various banks led by
Bank of Baroda
for business expansion and other purposes. Two fictitious entities were set up in the name of employees loyal to Purushottam Mandhana, but no genuine business was ever undertaken by these companies, the charge sheet said. By inflating its turnover without actual business, the Mandhana group managed to get more credit facilities from banks, it alleged.
The bank loans were used by the Mandhana family to repay personal loans, purchase immovable properties and for stock trading among other things, the charge sheet said. They purchased the shares of Mandhana Industries to inflate the share price, the ED claimed.
The agency had arrested both Purushottam and Priyavrat in the case. While Purushottam is now out on bail, Priyavrat is in judicial custody.

Apparel companies expect retail market to remain weak during festive season,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-companies-expect-retail-market-to-remain-weak-during-festive-season/articleshow/113743800.cms,27-09-2024,"Apparel companies
expect the
retail market
to remain weak during the
festive season
. As per a survey conducted by the apparel industry body, 63% of the respondents expect the same or lower clothing and apparel sales than last year. Out of these, 25% expect the sales to be as low as 75% of last year.
The survey was conducted by the
Clothing Manufacturers Association of India
(CMAI).
“Considering the sluggish business environment that our industry has experienced in the past six months, the trends are not surprising. Yet, we are hopeful of not missing out on the festive spending and expect demand to gradually surge considering the wedding season later in the year,” Rajesh Masand, president of CMAI said.
As many as 35% of the respondents have lower expectations because of the shift in
consumer spending
towards other avenues of lifestyles, while 24% of the respondents attribute it to a slowing economy and inflation.
However, only 18% of respondents expect low-priced brands to do better in this festive season. 75% of respondents still feel that
mid-priced brands
will do better. CMAI said that this indicates “the Indian consumer’s growing maturity in not just considering price points, but also an inclination to pay a premium for quality.”

India's textile roadmap: $350 billion industry and 4.5-6 crore jobs by 2030,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/indias-textile-roadmap-350-billion-industry-and-4-5-6-crore-jobs-by-2030/articleshow/113743915.cms,27-09-2024,"India has made a roadmap for its
textile industry
to grow to $350 billion by 2030 from around $164 billion now and create 4.5-6 crore jobs,
textile minister Giriraj Singh
said Friday.
At the ministry’s 100-day programme, he also said that the seven
PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel
(MITRA) parks approved earlier will have investment to the tune of Rs 70,000 crore when fully functional, thereby creating 21 lakh jobs.
“To reach a size of $350 billion in the coming days, we need man-made fabric, whether it be synthetic, viscose or natural fibre, we are preparing for everything,” Singh said, adding that over 350 brands globally procure clothes from India.
Singh also said that neither Bangladesh nor Vietnam was ever a challenge for India’s
textile exports
and “there is this havoc being created about Bangladesh posing a challenge to India's textile industry”.
Setting a target of 50,000 metric tonne production and employment generation of 1 crore by 2030, he said that cultivation of silk is linked to employment generation of farmers.

India aims to achieve $600 billion of textile exports by 2047 from $44 billion in FY22 and the domestic market to grow to $1.8 trillion from $110 billion in 2022
Officials said that around a dozen companies are set to start receiving incentives under the Production Linked Incentive (
PLI
) scheme for the textile sector in the current financial year amid signs of a recovery in textile exports in August.
“The government will start disbursing the
textile PLI incentives
from this year. Around 40 companies have already grounded investment. We hope that in this financial year, 10-12 companies will get incentive payout under PLI,” said an official, adding that a call is being taken on the next edition of the PLI scheme. The current scheme covers technical textiles and manmade fibre products.
The government had launched the Rs 10,683 crore PLI scheme to promote the production of MMF apparel, MMF fabrics and Products of Technical Textiles in the country to enable the textiles industry to achieve size and scale and to become competitive.

Road map prepared to create up to 6 cr jobs in textiles sector by 2030: Minister Giriraj Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/road-map-prepared-to-create-up-to-6-cr-jobs-in-textiles-sector-by-2030-minister-giriraj-singh/articleshow/113737687.cms,27-09-2024,"New Delhi: The government has prepared a road map for creating 4.5-6 crore jobs in the
textile sector
by 2030, Union Minister
Giriraj Singh
said on Friday, asserting that efforts are being made to take the sector's market size to USD 350 billion from around USD 165 billion at present. Addressing a press conference on the 100-day programme of
Ministry of Textiles
, Singh said: ""The 100-day road map we have prepared includes (attracting) investment to the tune of lakhs of crores (in the textile sector) going forward. We have prepared a road map for creation of 4.5 crore to 6 crore jobs by 2030.""
He shared that the seven PM-MITRA integrated mega
textile parks
approved earlier will have investment to the tune of Rs 70,000 crore when fully functional, thereby creating 21 lakh jobs.
Taking a dig at previous Congress-led governments, he said, they would not do anything in the first three months whereas the Modi government has started with a 100-day road map.
""Earlier, when a new government was formed, for three months, they would speak in irreverant terms. Which, they (in an apparent reference to
Rahul Gandhi
) are currently doing abroad. On the other hand, the Modi government has drawn a road map for development in the first three months,"" Singh said.
He said that there are plans to take the size of
India
's textile sector to USD 350 billion.

""To reach a size of USD 350 billion in the coming days, we need man-made fabric, whether it be synthetic, viscose or natural fibre, we are preparing for everything,"" said the minister, adding that over 350 brands globally procure clothes from India and one should look not just the export figures but domestic numbers also.
Notably,
India's textiles
exports declined for the second year in a row in 2023-24.
The government has set an ambitious target to achieve USD 100 billion export for textile products by 2030.
Exports of textiles and apparel from India during FY24 fell 3.24 per cent at USD 34.4 billion, as compared to USD 35.5 billion a year ago.
Singh stated that efforts are underway to promote
Make in India
for the textiles sector, adding that neither Bangladesh nor Vietnam poses a challenge to the domestic industry.
""We are promoting Make in India for the country's textiles sector(to meet the demand of growing population). It is a different matter that our population increases by more than the size of Australia's population every year. In the last ten years, more than 21 crore people were born (in India),"" he said.
""I would like to state clearly that neither Bangladesh nor Vietnam was ever a challenge for me.... there is this havoc being created about Bangladesh (posing a challenge to India's textile industry,"" the minister added.
Singh, who represents the Begusarai electoral constituency in Bihar, said a scheme has been approved for the revival of Bhagalpur's silk industry.

"'Make in India' initiative helped boost manufacturing, exports, strengthening economy",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/make-in-india-initiative-helped-boost-manufacturing-exports-strengthening-economy/articleshow/113673179.cms,25-09-2024,"The
Modi government
's flagship initiative '
Make in India
' launched 10 years ago has helped the country boost
exports
, push investments and promote
manufacturing
. Under the initiative, launched on September 25, 2014, a series of measures have been taken by the government to boost local manufacturing.
These initiatives include the rollout of production linked incentive (PLI) schemes for 14 sectors, easing
foreign direct investment
(FDI) norms, reducing compliance burden to improve business climate, all approvals through single window, and rolling out of the
national logistics policy
.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a post on X stated that Make in India has led to a rise in exports in different sectors, building capacities and strengthening economy.
""It's noteworthy how exports have risen in various sectors, capacities have been built, and thus, the economy has been strengthened. The Government of India is committed to encouraging 'Make in India' through all possible ways. India's strides in reforms will also continue,"" Modi said.
Commerce and Industry Minister
Piyush Goyal
said that these measures which also includes zero tolerance for corruption and the focused effort on emerging sectors like electronics have helped promote 'Make In India' and boost both domestic and foreign investments in the country.
Live Events
""We have achieved great success and a brilliant future is ahead for manufacturing in the country as the 'Make in India' programme is celebrating its 10 years,"" he said.
The initiative was launched on September 25, 2014, to facilitate investment, foster innovation, build world-class infrastructure, and make India a hub for manufacturing, design, and innovation.
The government also gave investors stable and predictable policies, with a commitment not to do retrospective amendments. the minister said.
He added that measures at the tarde front have resulted in an increase in domestic capacities which have met the needs of India as well as helped boost the country's exports which reached an all-time high of USD 778 billion in 2023-24.
The minister expressed confidence that with the increasing momentum seen under the Make in India programme, ""we believe that the share of manufacturing will also start increasing in the coming years"".
Over the last 10 financial years,
FDI inflow
has increased by 119 per cent reaching USD 667 billion, compared to USD 304 billion in the previous 10 years (2005-14), with over 90 per cent of total FDI received through the automatic route.
Secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Amardeep Singh Bhatia said India is receiving foreign direct investments (FDI) of USD 70-80 billion every year and is expected to hit USD 100 billion per annum in the coming years.
The department is also streamlining approval processes for FDI applications.
The government has taken a series of measures to promote investments into the country such as easing the norms in sectors such as defense, railways, insurance, and telecom.
""We are targeting much higher investment flows. We have about USD 70 billion to USD 80 billion which is coming in every year. But we are expecting this to increase to at least USD 100 billion a year in the years to come,"" Bhatia told reporters here.
According to DPIIT, defence contracts worth billions of dollars were awarded to Indian companies like Tata, L&T, and
Bharat Forge
, fostering a growing ecosystem of
defense manufacturing
.
Goyal also said that encouraged by the success of
Jan Vishwas law
, rolled out last year, the government is working on its second edition to further decriminalise minor offences.
He said that the ministry has received a number of inputs from stakeholders and departments to further decriminalise minor offences in the second edition of the Jan Vishwas bill, expected to be tabled in Parliament in Budget session next year.
Last year, the Jan Vishwas law was rolled out to promote ease of business by decriminalising minor offences through amendments in 183 provisions of 42 acts.
""We have received a very good response so far. A number of departments have come forward with proactive suggestions to decriminalise laws under their ministries and stakeholders have given good inputs on the areas where they are looking for de-criminalisation without compromising on safety and security and national interest,"" Goyal told PTI.
When asked whether the bill can be tabled in the winter session of Parliament, he said it will need more time for consultation, ""so possible more in the budget session"".

Organised apparel retailers to clock 8-20 pc revenue growth in FY25: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/organised-apparel-retailers-to-clock-8-20-pc-revenue-growth-in-fy25-report/articleshow/113629051.cms,24-09-2024,"Mumbai: Festive and wedding season and increasing preference for
fast fashion
is expected to help the
organised retail apparel
sector log 8-10 per cent
revenue growth
this financial year, a report said on Tuesday. The organised retail apparel sector will clock a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent this fiscal riding on higher demand stemming from a normal monsoon, easing inflation, festive and wedding season and increasing preference for fast fashion, which is inexpensive, trendy clothing that mimics high fashion designs and popular styles,
Crisil Ratings
said in a report.
""The mass market segment accounts for 60 per cent of total sales now, compared with 56 per cent before the pandemic, due to the rising popularity of fast fashion, which is expected to be the primary revenue driver this fiscal. The likely increase in demand for premium clothing during the upcoming festive and wedding seasons will also contribute to overall revenue growth of 8-10 per cent this fiscal,"" Crisil Ratings Senior Director Anuj Sethi said.
However, revenue growth will be slower than the compound annual growth rate of 11-12 per cent seen between fiscals 2018 and 2023, making retailers cautious at opening new stores, the report noted.
Instead, retailers will focus on enhancing efficiencies at existing stores, controlling costs and limiting reliance on external debt, which will help maintain their operating margin at 7.2-7.4 per cent despite continued high marketing expenses, thereby ensuring stable credit profiles, it added.
In the apparel retail business, the mass market is the largest segment, followed by premium and luxury.
Live Events
Fast fashion, a growing subset of the mass market, offers the latest trends, frequently updated throughout the season with a shorter lead time to reach customers quickly.
The report said that retailers are adjusting business strategies, enhancing supply chain efficiency and focusing on new trends - particularly in fast fashion - to meet the evolving
consumer behaviour
.
With consumer spending shifting towards travel experiences and luxury goods in major urban locations, retailers will be cautious at
store expansion
there, while continuing to expand in tier II and III cities, which are transitioning towards organised retail.
The area addition will be lower year-on-year at 2.2 million square feet compared with 3.6 million square feet last fiscal as store sizes will be smaller, said the report.
Meanwhile, Crisil Ratings further said that revenue density is expected to remain flat at Rs 11,900 per square foot due to muted growth in same-store sales and will restrict significant improvement in profitability.
""The marginal increase in profitability this fiscal will be driven by apparel retailers streamlining existing stores and opening new stores only as necessary, given that demand has not fully recovered. Besides, the need to offer higher discounts and incur marketing spends to attract customers will limit the overall improvement in operating margin to 7.2-7.4 per cent against 7 per cent in fiscal 2024,"" Crisil Ratings Associate Director Anil More said.
According to the report better inventory management and stable input costs will prevent significant inventory write-offs, unlike last fiscal when sharp cost changes lowered profitability by 100-110 basis points.
Consistent cash flow and limited reliance on debt to fund store expansion will lead to adequate debt metrics.
Interest coverage and total debt/Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) ratios of apparel retailers are expected to be 6.2 times and 1.7 times, respectively, in 2024-25, in line with last fiscal, it added.
However, changes in commodity prices, inflation trends, consumer spending behaviour, and retailers' ability to sustain the momentum in the fast fashion segment needs to be watched, added the report.

India’s own body size chart for clothes soon: Giriraj Singh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/indias-own-body-size-chart-for-clothes-soon-giriraj-singh/articleshow/113102120.cms,05-09-2024,"India will soon roll out INDIAsize, its own
sizing system
for
clothes
instead of sizes based on those of the UK and the US, to better suit the Indian body types,
textiles minister
Giriraj Singh said Thursday.
At present, international and domestic brands available in India use measurements from the US or the UK for garments, having small, medium and large sizes. However, Western body types differ from Indians in terms of height, weight, or specific measurements of body parts, which sometimes lead to fitting issues.
“On IndiaSIZE, I'm trying to get the Prime Minister to inaugurate it; it should be launched soon,” Singh said while launching VisioNxt Fashion Forecasting Initiative’ of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT).
VisioNxt is India's first-ever initiative that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence (EI) to generate fashion trend insights and forecasts.
“Its mission is to identify, map, and analyse geo-specific trends, reflecting the positive plurality, cultural diversity, and socio-economic nuances of India while collating comprehensive trends and insights,” textiles ministry said in a statement.
Live Events
India’s entry into the forecasting space offers multiple advantages. Besides reducing dependence on global forecasting agencies, it provides unique insights into Indian fashion consumers, integrates India’s strength in information technology with textiles and combines artificial and human intelligence.
“A pioneering AI deep learning model developed in-house, identifies over 60 Indian wear and 40 western wear categories through computation with mandated accuracy, facilitating machine learning applications—a first in India,” the ministry said.
The initiative also involved creating a comprehensive dataset of more than 70,000 primary apparel images, along with above 2.8 lakh secondary image data, to identify patterns in key apparel attributes, including style, color, and regional accents.
VisioNxt positions India globally among countries that predict fashion trends, increasing the visibility of Indian fashion vocabulary and identity while reducing dependence on international trend agencies, according to the statement.

India to become a billion dollar market for Apparel group in five years : Co-founder Nilesh Ved,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/india-to-become-a-billion-dollar-market-for-apparel-group-in-five-years-co-founder-nilesh-ved/articleshow/113056683.cms,06-09-2024,"Nilesh Ved
said it is targeting revenues of a billion dollar from India in the next five years after quadrupling its store network to 1000. The Dubai-based retailer that retails brand such Victoria’s Secret, Charles & Keith,
Aldo
, Bath & Body Works posted sales of Rs 800 crore revenue in FY24 and have 250 outlets at present.
“India is a very important market. The growth percentage in India is much higher than what we are seeing anywhere else in last few years. At this moment, India is less than 10% of our business, but we see that this will go to at least more than 50% of our business the way it is growing,”
Ved
said.
Apparel group
is a $2.2 billion company globally.
“To achieve a billion dollar out of India in five years, we need to put more stores and work on the formats that we do outside to bring them here,” Ved said.
Apparel group operates about 85 brands globally with 2200 stores, while in India it has 17 active brands.
Live Events
“We cater to the value segment with R&B, which we plan to expand aggressively in India,” Ved said.
For the footwear brands, the group manufactures in India and has plan to increase the manufacturing capability.
“We still import handbags but gradually manufacturing for that will also shift in India. There is a big opportunity in exporting from India, once we get the scale, we will be able to export also from here,” Ved said.
The biggest challenge for company is finding good real estate.
“We need platform like shopping malls to grow, for us to grow. I think pricing (rentals) will come down with more shopping malls coming, which will help the industry,” the executive said.
Ved said that physical retail is here to stay and in the US also, the good malls have done, while the bad ones are bad anyway, and will get worse.
Post Covid, consumer is not believing in saving for future, which has resulted in increase in consumption.

"Textile exports to remain strong amid global shifts, FTA negotiations with UK and EU will offer additional growth opportunities",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/textile-exports-to-remain-strong-amid-global-shifts-fta-negotiations-with-uk-and-eu-will-offer-additional-growth-opportunities/articleshow/113014134.cms,03-09-2024,"New Delhi: The Indian
textile industry
is set to experience developments in 2024, driven by improving demand in export markets, resilient consumer spending in key sectors, and favourable geopolitical conditions, according to the B&K Securities report.
In the ready-made garments (RMG) sector, the demand offtake in export markets is anticipated to show substantial improvement in 2024.
While domestic demand is expected to remain moderate due to lower discretionary spending and overstocking from the previous fiscal year, the recovery in export demand is promising. The domestic market could see a boost in the second half of FY25, supported by an increase in wedding days and festive season, although the rise in realisations is likely to be marginal.
The export growth in RMG is expected to be driven by a combination of factors including restocking by Western retailers, increased demand for spring-summer collections, and a general uptick in retail sales.
The anticipated interest rate cuts in the US will further stimulate demand. India's RMG exports will also benefit from stable cotton prices and uninterrupted supply, enhancing cost competitiveness on the global stage.

The ongoing crisis in Bangladesh, a major player in the global RMG market, presents a temporary tailwind for Indian exporters.
However, the benefits for India are expected to be short-lived due to differences in product portfolios and Bangladesh's trade agreements with the European Union.
Over the medium to long term, India could see more substantial gains as global buyers continue to diversify their supply chains away from China and Bangladesh, particularly as Bangladesh faces challenges such as rising wages and the loss of its Least Developed Country (LDC) status by 2029.
The home textiles segment is poised to continue its growth trajectory, primarily driven by robust consumer spending in the United States, which accounts for approximately 60 per cent of India's home
textile exports
.
The market share of Indian players in the US has been steadily increasing, supported by the China+1 strategy adopted by big box retailers to diversify their supply chains.
India's competitive advantage in raw material costs and increased domestic capacity will likely sustain its dominance in the US home textiles market.
The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with the UK and the European Union offer additional opportunities for growth, potentially leading to higher margins and increased market share for Indian players.
While the industry is on a positive trajectory, it faces near-term challenges such as logistical disruptions due to the Red Sea crisis and uncompetitive domestic cotton prices. Moreover, as sustainability becomes a major theme in Western markets, Indian textile companies will need to invest in compliance with these evolving norms to remain competitive.

Raymond receiving large number of business inquiries after Bangladesh crisis: Raymond CMD Gautam Singhania,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/raymond-receiving-large-number-of-business-inquiries-after-bangladesh-crisis-raymond-cmd-gautam-singhania/articleshow/112964099.cms,01-09-2024,"Leading textiles and apparel company
Raymond
has received a ""huge number of inquiries"" from global firms after the crisis in neighbouring Bangladesh and is ready to grab this opportunity, its Chairman & Managing Director
Gautam Hari Singhania
said. Raymond, which has invested in its garmenting facility to become the third largest suit maker in the world, is ready to ""take advantage"" from the current situation, Singhania told PTI.
Asked if he expects shifting of some
garmenting business
to
India
from Bangladesh, he said, ""We are hoping so. We are seeing the inquiries. It obviously needs a little bit of time, but we are certainly seeing positive signs on that.""
India is better-placed with its end-to-end supply capabilities linking all stages as companies as
Raymond
are present in both fabric and garmenting business, which, in turn, will save time for international brands also on final delivery, he said.
""Bangladesh does not have a fabric supply. India has got a great opportunity to take advantage of this fabric supply because we have the fabric base here. They have (only) garmenting base,"" said Singhania.
Singhania said Raymond's capacity expansion has come online, which is perfectly timed.

""So we are lucky to have those capacities,"" he said, adding, ""we are... always looking for opportunities"".
Though Indian labour may be more expensive than Bangladesh, ""look at the totality of the situation. I have a fabric and end-to-end supply. I save your time for which you pay me something.""
Moreover, India is a politically stable country with a large middle class with great consumption and manufacturing capabilities.
The company has divested Raymond Lifestyle, following its demerger with parent company Raymond, which is all set to list this week. This would house all apparel-related businesses of the nearly 100-year-old Raymond group.
Besides Bangladesh, the world is also working on a 'China+1' strategy, making India a preferred sourcing destination.
""This is playing to our advantage, leading to stronger business relationships with existing customers and presenting multiple opportunities for new markets and customer acquisition,"" he said.
""Everybody needs a hedging strategy. Nobody would like to put all the eggs in one basket,"" the Raymond CMD added.
Moreover, the quality of work done in India in apparel-related work is better than in China.
""China is about quantity, if you want cheap quality, go to China and India is about value. They are volume and we are value and quality,"" Singhania said.
Raymond's Garmenting Unit is a white-labelled manufacturer and an integrated supplier of high-value clothing products to leading international brands.
According to its latest annual report, Raymond has a capacity to produce 7.5 million pieces of jackets, trousers and shirts in India and 3.2 million in Ethiopia.

Textile exports to reach USD 65 bn by FY-26 and USD 350 bn by 2030: Invest India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/textile-exports-to-reach-usd-65-bn-by-fy-26-and-usd-350-bn-by-2030-invest-india/articleshow/112760630.cms,24-08-2024,"India's textile industry is on the brink of expansion, with total
textile exports
projected to reach USD 65 billion by FY26, according to
Invest India
.
Invest India posted on X, ""PM Modi's bold '#fibretofashion' vision is guiding the #textileindustry to become a driving force in the global market while bringing competence & technology to local players.""
According to Invest India, the
domestic textile market
, valued at around USD 165 billion in 2022, includes USD 125 billion from domestic sales and USD 40 billion from exports. Projections indicate that the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 per cent to reach USD 350 billion by 2030.
In addition to its textile achievements, India has emerged as the second-largest manufacturer of personal protective equipment (PPE) globally. With over 600 certified PPE-producing companies, India is well-positioned in a market expected to exceed USD 92.5 billion by 2025, up from USD 52.7 billion in 2019.
The textile industry is also a major employment driver, providing direct jobs to 45 million individuals and an additional 100 million in related sectors. Cotton cultivation alone supports an estimated 6 million farmers and 40-50 million people involved in processing and trade.
Live Events
Several factors contribute to the industry's growth, including India's world-class infrastructure, a focus on
technical textiles
driven by demand from sectors such as automotive, healthcare, and infrastructure, and the availability of raw materials and skilled labour. Competitive manufacturing costs and a growing retail landscape, including e-commerce, further enhance the sector's attractiveness.
To support this growth, the Indian government has introduced the
Production Linked Incentive
(PLI) Scheme with an allocation of Rs 10,683 crore. This initiative aims to scale up the production of man-made fiber (MMF) apparel, MMF fabrics, and technical textiles. Under the PLI scheme, 64 applications have been approved, involving a proposed investment of Rs 19,798 crore, with a projected turnover of Rs 1,93,926 crore and anticipated employment for 2,45,362 individuals. Investments are notably planned in Madhya Pradesh,
Uttar Pradesh
, and Rajasthan.
Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) in the textile sector remains robust, with 100 per cent FDI permitted under the automatic route. From April 2000 to March 2024, India has attracted USD 4.47 billion in FDI in textiles, including dyed and printed fabrics.
Currently, India is one of the world's largest producers of textiles and apparel, contributing approximately 2.3 per cent to the country's GDP, 13 per cent to industrial production, and 12 per cent to exports.
The country holds a 4 per cent share of global textile and apparel trade, highlighting its substantial role in the international market.
The Indian textile sector is diverse and extensive, with India being the second-largest producer of cotton and jute globally and the second-largest producer of silk. Remarkably, India accounts for 95 per cent of the world's hand-woven fabric.

Innerwear sales indicate economic turnaround is here to come,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/innerwear-sales-indicate-economic-turnaround-is-here-to-come/articleshow/112595449.cms,17-08-2024,"Amid positive indicators for the economy such as slowing inflation and progress of the southwest monsoon, here's another that reflects optimism: inner wear sales.
Leading companies such as
Page Industries
, which has the rights for the
Jockey brand
in India,
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
,
Arvind Fashions
and Rupa & Co. have attested to this in earnings calls this month. A consumption recovery of inner wear, including men's underwear, is in sight with green shoots visible in the June quarter. Sentiment has also been boosted by sales kicking off through quick commerce.
The so-called men's underwear index, thought up by former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, is said to detect the beginning of a recovery during tough times, marking a turnaround from a slump in consumption. When money is tight, people, especially men, tend to put purchases of these essential garments off as long as they can - that's the theory.
Page Industries management told investors that sales have been lifted with better footfalls thanks to a revival in demand as well as action to improve inventory health at distribution hubs and ensuring new launches are available in stores. Managing director Ganesh VS cited early positive indicators.
Live Events
In its June quarter earnings release, Page said
consumer confidence
is rebounding and leading to increased spending on clothing and accessories.
""The rise of
ecommerce
and digital platforms has expanded market reach, enabling brands to connect with the consumers more effectively,"" it said. ""The industry is poised for significant growth.""
Inner wear sales have been particularly impacted for over six quarters now, along with a slowdown in overall
apparel demand
. Primary sales, or despatches from companies to dealers, for the industry were stagnant for the last few quarters due to high unsold stock since Covid. Primary sales by volume, or number of units sold, grew last quarter, though at a slower pace than secondary sales.
For Arvind Fashions, the inner wear category is growing at double digits, faster than overall sales at the company. Rupa said revenue grew 8% in the April-June period while volume growth was 9% ""supported by strong sales in the economy.""
Lux Industries
too reported a 9% jump in volume and revenue last quarter.
VIP Clothing
, which sells brands such as VIP and Frenchie, said there were ""signs of recovery and growth in the market."" The company said in its management guidance that revenue is expected to grow 15-20% in the September quarter ""owing to good visibility of product offtake.""
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail's management said while the inner wear business posted growth last quarter, the
athleisure segment
continues to shrink due to the high base of the Covid period when multiple new brands had entered the segment due to a sudden surge in demand. However, managing director Ashish Dikshit said, even for athleisure, the worst is behind with the base stabilising.
Apart from the men's underwear index, other macro indicators are also pointing toward a recovery. Inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July was 3.54%, the lowest in nearly five years, although this was accentuated by the base effect. The monsoon is progressing normally, while the Reserve Bank of India last week maintained the Indian economy will grow at 7.2% in FY25.
""Domestic economic activity continues to be resilient,"" RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said last week. ""On the supply side, steady progress in southwest monsoon, higher cumulative kharif sowing and improving reservoir levels augur very well for kharif output. Manufacturing activity continues to gain ground on the back of improving domestic demand.""

textiles
and apparel
exports
in July grew by 4.73 per cent to USD 2,937.56 million compared to the same month last year mainly driven by an increase in demand for apparels, the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) said on Thursday. Textiles and
apparel
exports stood at USD 2,805.01 million in July 2023,
CITI
said.
While the textile exports were steady at USD 1,660.36 million in July compared to USD 1,663.06 million, apparel shipments during the month surged by 11.84 per cent to USD 1,277.20 million from USD 1,141.95 million during the same time last year.
""This year has shown promising progress for India's T&A exports, particularly when compared to last year. The growth in exports is largely attributed to the expanding share of Indian apparel in key markets such as the US, alongside increased exports to the European Union and the UK,"" CITI Chairman Rakesh Mehra said.
The industry, he said, remains optimistic about export orders in the upcoming months, and is poised to further leverage the concluded Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) like the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) and the India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).
""These agreements are expected to provide additional momentum to our exports. The industry anticipates continued growth and is strategically positioning itself to capitalise on these opportunities, ensuring that India remains a key player in the global textiles and apparel market,"" he added.

Nirmala Sitharaman
said on Saturday, expressing hope that the interim government there will settle things ""sooner rather than later.""
Interacting with the media on the sidelines of customary post Budget address to the central board of
Reserve Bank of India
, she said efforts are being taken to ensure that borders with the neighbouring country are safe.
With regard to Indian investments, she said, the textile industry particularly from Tamil Nadu has made investments there in good faith and they have done well having gone there.
""The exports from Bangladesh also increased because of the duty and quota liberal approach that we have towards low-income countries. They (Indian garment industry based in Bangladesh) could even export to India.""
Particularly, she said, the garment and knitted fabric sector is seeing a bit of uncertainty because of the crisis in the neighbouring country.
Live Events
""I hope that the investments are all safe... it's too early for me to see what kind of an impact this situation in Bangladesh will have on our economy. I hope that the interim government will settle things sooner rather than later so that both the people of Bangladesh and India can get back to normalcy,"" she said.
Earlier this week, Bangladesh plunged into a political crisis when Sheikh Hasina resigned as the Prime Minister and fled the country. Soon after Parliament was dissolved leading to the creation of an interim government.
The 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus on Thursday took oath as the head of an interim government, replacing Sheikh Hasina who abruptly resigned and fled to India leaving the country in turmoil following deadly protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs.
On Friday, Bangladesh's interim leader Yunus announced the portfolios of his 16-member council of advisors and named a former top diplomat to head the foreign ministry.
The Nobel laureate's first task is to bring stability to Bangladesh after he responded to a call by student protesters for him to temporarily lead the country following weeks of deadly anti-government demonstrations against the government led by Sheikh Hasina.

"Uniqlo India profit jumps 25%, sales growth declines",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/uniqlo-india-profit-jumps-25-sales-growth-declines/articleshow/112411712.cms,10-08-2024,"New Delhi: Japanese apparel major Uniqlo's sales growth in India slipped by more than half to a still-strong 32% last fiscal year while its net profit expanded by 25%.
The Indian unit of Asia's biggest clothing brand posted a net profit of ₹85.1 crore for the year ended March 2024 with net revenues of ₹824 crore, according to its latest filing with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).
Uniqlo India
had posted a profit of ₹68.1 crore with sales of ₹625 crore in the previous year. Its on-year revenue growth was 69% in FY23 and 64% in FY22.
Uniqlo opened its first door in the country in September 2019, but lockdowns and other constraints during the Covid-19 pandemic delayed its store expansion plans. At present, it has about 13 outlets in the country. Overall retail sales growth rate across segments such as apparel, footwear and quick service restaurants (QSR) fell year-on-year every month in FY24, reflecting comparatively weaker consumer sentiment.
Last fiscal's comparatively slower 4-7% growth rate sustained this year as well, with May and June seeing a 3% and 5% rise each,
Retailers Association of India
(RAI) recently said after a survey of top 100 retailers.

""The market was sluggish for the industry as a whole last year, and that will reflect in practice every brand P&L, whether Indian or international,"" said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of retail sector consultancy Third Eyesight. ""However, any brand that is committed to the Indian market as a strategic market for its future growth will take the ups and downs in its stride,"" he said.
""Uniqlo's expansion plans now include store sizes that would be smaller both in the cities it is already present in and in newer cities, which should help it tap into the demand at operating costs that are appropriate to each location,"" Dutta said. Inditex Trent, Spanish fast-fashion major
Zara
's joint venture with Tata that runs 23 stores in the country, saw its revenue rise 8% to ₹2,775 crore last fiscal, significantly down from 40% growth a year earlier, according to Trent's annual report. Its net profit fell 8% on year to ₹244 crore.
Over the past decade, global brands Zara and H&M have become market leaders in the
fast fashion
segment in India.
Uniqlo has said India is one of the most priority markets where consumers are increasingly shifting from 'fast fashion' to long-lasting essentials and functional wear. As the world's second most-populated country, India is an attractive market for apparel brands, especially with youngsters increasingly embracing western-style clothing.
Uniqlo is globally popular for functional basics like T-shirts, jeans and woollen wear, unlike fast-fashion rivals which are associated with designs that move quickly from the catwalk to the showroom.

India set for export order increase on the back of Bangladesh turmoil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/india-set-for-export-order-increase-on-the-back-of-bangladesh-turmoil/articleshow/112379065.cms,08-08-2024,"India
could gain 6-8% of
Bangladesh
’s monthly
ready made garment
(
RMG
)
export orders
in the short term and 10% in the long term, presenting an opportunity of increments of $200-250 million and $300-350 million respectively, rating agency CareEdge Ratings said Thursday.
“India is in a prime position to capitalise on the opportunity,” it said in a note.
Bangladesh occupied the second position with around 8.5% market share of
global exports
in 2023. Its share rose consistently during CY15-CY23 largely at the expense of China, which remains number one. India remains at 7th in terms of global readymade garment trade with a market share of around 3-4% during this period.
The socio-political uncertainties prevailing in Bangladesh may result in global RMG brands and retailers with a significant presence in Bangladesh diversifying their sourcing for meeting their delivery schedules, especially if the crisis persists for more than a quarter or two, it said.
It pointed out that India had enough headroom to increase ready made garment exports by 20-25% given the available capacities in the sector.

“With the China+1 sourcing strategy already in the works, global RMG brands and retailers have limited alternatives such as India, Vietnam and Cambodia to replace Bangladesh,” it said.
India has its presence across the textile value chain from fibre to garment, unlike Bangladesh which is largely dependent on the import of yarn and fabric, the agency said.
The agency highlighted that various government initiatives such as PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (
PM MITRA
) park,
Production Linked Incentive
(PLI) scheme, and free trade agreements (FTAs) with key export markets, are designed to enhance
textile exports
.
“These factors collectively position India as a strong alternative for global brands seeking reliable garment supplies,” it said.

Bangladesh
may lead to short-term shifting of
garment orders
to India. However, they added that
India
has no intention or inclination to exploit this unfortunate situation in its friendly neighbouring country.
On Monday, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country amid massive public anger over her government's controversial quota system reserving 30 per cent of jobs for families of veterans who fought the 1971 liberation war. More than 400 people have been killed in the protests.
Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary General of the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) said that the current situation in Bangladesh is a matter of great concern for all the exporters.
""We wish that the situation stabilizes quickly and normal business resumes. We are a friendly neighbour country and completely empathize with the unfortunate incidents of violent protests that are unfolding in Bangladesh,"" he said.
Thakur added that India has no intention or inclination to exploit this unfortunate situation in its friendly neighbouring country.

""The Indian garment industry is making serious efforts to grow RMG exports on its own, based on its merit. However, it is quite likely that in short-term garment orders may shift to India and the Indian apparel industry may be asked to fill the gap caused by this severe disruption,"" he said.
Ludhiana-based exporter S C Ralhan said that the political crisis in the neighbouring country will impact timely payments.
He said that normalisation of the situation would help in the smooth movement of goods.
Ralhan said that Indian firms having units in Bangladesh would face the impact.
""There would be stress on timely payments,"" Ralhan said.
Bangladesh is a key player in garments in the world and it imports cotton from India.

"Bangladesh crisis poses ""significant concerns"" for India's textile, apparel industry: CITI",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/bangladesh-crisis-poses-significant-concerns-for-indias-textile-apparel-industry-citi/articleshow/112316500.cms,06-08-2024,"Bangladesh, which is facing its worst political crisis since Independence in 1971, poses ""significant concerns"" for India's textile and apparel sector, particularly for companies operating factories in the neighbouring country, the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry said on Tuesday. The domestic textile industry body believes that any supply disruption in Bangladesh will have an immediate impact on the supply chain, potentially affecting production schedules and delivery timelines of Indian firms.
""The situation in Bangladesh is indeed concerning, and we are closely monitoring the developments. Bangladesh's growth in the textile sector has been inspiring and has lent strength to the trade flows in the entire subcontinent.
""While we are concerned about the impact on the supply chain and the potential delays and disruptions it might cause, we are hopeful that the situation will improve soon,"" Chandrima Chatterjee, Secretary General, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) said.
According to CITI, Indian companies with manufacturing operations in the country are likely to face challenges in maintaining their production flow, leading to delays and potential shortages in the market. This disruption could affect the availability of products and might force companies to seek alternative manufacturing solutions to mitigate the impact.
""Amid the uncertainties in Bangladesh, there is already a noticeable shift towards alternative manufacturing hubs such as a strategic move by companies to diversify their production bases and reduce dependency on a single market,"" CITI stated.
Live Events
It observed that Indian textile hub Tirupur, known for its robust textile and apparel manufacturing capabilities, may emerge as a key beneficiary of this shift.
Bangladesh is facing its worst political crisis since independence in 1971, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigning amid massive anti-government protests.
Bangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman on Monday announced that an interim government would be taking over the responsibilities.
""Several major global brands that rely on Bangladesh for their sourcing needs will also be affected by these disruptions. Brands with significant portions of their supply chain rooted in Bangladesh may experience delays and a decrease in the availability of their products. This, in turn, could lead to a ripple effect across the global retail market, affecting inventory levels and sales,"" CITI said.
Bangladesh is a crucial market for Indian textiles, serving as both a manufacturing hub and a significant export destination.
""The Indian industry is deeply concerned about the current events and hopes for the swift restoration of normalcy. Stability in Bangladesh is vital for maintaining the smooth operation of cross-border trade and production,"" CITI said.

The minister said that countries around the globe want to have FTAs with India and expand relations.
Goyal noted that by 2047, India will be a USD 35 trillion economy, owing to the young, aspirational population of the country.
He said that the government's work is centered around various principles, including minimum government - maximum governance, skill development, speed & scalability, transparency, and digitization.
Going ahead, the Minister said, ""The government also focuses on monitoring and prioritising issues and ensuring time-bound execution of projects within the cost. This is an outcome-oriented nation, ready to take on the challenges of the future.""
Addressing the gathering, Jayant Chaudhary, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and Minister of State for Education, Government of India, said that the Union Budget is very forward-looking and not just a statement of accounts, with the FM emphasizing entrepreneurship, youth, education, and skilling. We need to facilitate and build an ecosystem that makes skills aspirational for our youth, he noted.
Chaudhary went on to state that creating a vibrant middle class and an economy that truly values innovation is when the real social churn will become visible.
""The Government is going to work towards these aspects. South Korea took 15 years to transition towards a knowledge economy. Given India's legacy system and pace of change, our country could take a little longer. There is a lot to do on India's knowledge index; however, we are progressing with key drivers,"" he added.

"Khadi, handloom sales rising, creating job opportunities in large numbers: PM Modi",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/khadi-handloom-sales-rising-creating-job-opportunities-in-large-numbers-pm-modi/articleshow/112078598.cms,28-07-2024,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that
Khadi
Gramodyog's business has crossed Rs 1.5 lakh crore for the first time and asserted that the rising
sales
of Khadi and
handloom
were creating new
job opportunities
in large numbers. In his Mann Ki Baat monthly radio broadcast, Modi said many people who would not be using Khadi products earlier now wear them with great pride.
""The Khadi Gramodyog's business has crossed Rs 1.5 lakh crore for the first time. Do you know how much sales of Khadi have gone up '400 per cent'. The rising sales of Khadi and handloom are creating new job opportunities in large numbers,"" he said.
Mostly women are associated with this industry so they are benefitting the most, he added.
""You must be having different types of clothes and till now if you have not bought khadi clothes then start buying them,"" Modi said.
With the start of the
Paris Olympics
, the prime minister said the games give our athletes a chance to hoist the national flag at the international level. He urged people to encourage them and 'Cheer for Bharat'.

During the broadcast, he also interacted with Indian students who performed very well in the recently held Mathematics olympiad.
""A few days ago, an Olympics took place in the world of mathematics also: the International Mathematics Olympiad. Indian students have performed very well in this Olympiad. Our team won four gold medals and one silver medal,"" Modi said.
The prime minister also hailed the inclusion of the ' Moidams' in Assam in the UNESCO world heritage list and said it is a matter of immense joy for every Indian.

Lowered customs may improve India’s global position in apparel and footwear market,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/lowered-customs-may-improve-indias-global-position-in-apparel-and-footwear-market/articleshow/112018015.cms,25-07-2024,"Made-in-India
apparel
and
footwear
may become a larger part of the global sourcing for brands like Zara, H&M, Marks and Spencer and Gap with finance minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
announcing a lot of exemptions on import duties of raw materials for apparel and footwear only when they are further exported. Local manufacturers said this will make the Indian produce price competitive in the global market compared to Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, and Southeast Asian nations.
The winter-wear clothes, that require real down-filling material from duck or goose, are not manufactured much in
India
. This is because of the lack of raw materials and the cost of production. Due to the
lowered customs
on these raw materials, industry executives believe that the production, export, and India’s stand at the global competition can henceforth improve.
“By reducing the cost of these raw materials, our exports will become more competitive, and hopefully manufacturing will go up. Secondly, spandex is very largely and commonly used. So that will definitely make our products more competitive and that will open a large opportunity. Thirdly, the duty-free imports of trimmings will again make us much more competitive,” Rahul Mehta, president of Clothing Manufacturers Association told
ET
.
These raw materials cost 5-7% on an average of the total cost of the product to be exported. This move by the government will make the cost of manufacturing cheaper. Mehta said that the cost could be reduced by 2-4% because of the lowered duty.
The basic customs duty for Methylene Diphenyl Di-isocyanate (MDI) for use in the manufacture of Spandex Yarn has reduced from 7.5% to 5%. This benefit is for local consumption as well as for exports, while most of the other announcements are for exports specifically like the duty on wet white, crust, and finished leather for the manufacture of textile or leather garments, leather/synthetic footwear, or other leather products, which was 10%, has been waived off. Other additional accessories and embellishments for the manufacture of textile or leather garments, leather/synthetic footwear, or other leather products also have nil customs now. Customs duty on real down-filling material from duck or goose used in the manufacture of textile or leather garments has been reduced from 30% to 10%.

Budget to boost leather and footwear sector, says Rajendra Kumar Jalan, Chairman, CLE
The export duty on raw hides and skins is still the same, while that on tanned or crust hides of skins, wet blue chrome leather, and crust leather has been lowered from 40% to 20%, raw fur skins to 40%, and tanned or dressed fur skin from 60% to 20%. All these changes are effective from Wednesday.
Mehta added, “Most buyers are now looking for an alternative to China and even Bangladesh. So, India is a favourable destination. But there are certain products where India is just too expensive because of higher wages and higher cost of production. So, these are the products where Indian exporters will stand to gain significantly if they become more competitive.”
India holds about 3.5% of the global trade in the apparel industry. Global brands like Zara, H&M, Marks and Spencer, Walmart, Gap, Next, and Primark currently source apparel and footwear from India.
The basic customs duty exemption on specified goods used in the manufacture of textile or leather garments for export and used in the manufacture of leather or synthetic footwear or other leather products for export, when imported by a bonafide exporter has been extended up to 31st March 2026 in the Budget.

Mehta explained that India's exports are $16 billion, majorly restricted to casual cotton wear. Bangladesh's exports are $40 billion-plus, and China is $120 billion-plus. Since India’s production capacity is smaller than the rest, brands can not tap India for larger orders of the same style.
Due to the ongoing issues in Bangladesh, and increasing wages, a lot of global buyers are now choosing to source from India, said K. M. Subramanian, the president of the Tiruppur Exporters’ Association. He said, “The lower customs duty will help with the ease of doing business. It will make it easy for global brands to source from India. It will help with a good brand name and good qualities, but financially it will not help much.”
The Tiruppur Exporters’ Association exported around Rs. 35,000 crores last year. This year, they are targeting a 10% growth to Rs. 40,000 crores.

Delhi HC restrains local firms from using 'ADIDAS' mark,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/delhi-hc-restrains-local-firms-from-using-adidas-mark/articleshow/111934274.cms,22-07-2024,"The Delhi
High Court
has restrained three local firms -
Adidas
Weaving Mills, Adidas Textile Industries, and Adidas Merchandise - and their directors from manufacturing, trading, selling or dealing in
textile goods
under the 'ADIDAS' mark or any other marks deceptively similar to the
Adidas AG
’s trademark.
While Adidas AG had sought damages suffered from infringing use by the three firms to the tune of Rs 20 lakh, Justice Sanjeev Narula rejected the former's claim, saying it was entitled to nominal damages of Rs 3 lakh as it “has not led any evidence to demonstrate the actual damages suffered by them resulting from the defendants’ infringing use.”
Apart from the testimony of one witness, which merely stated that Adidas AG was entitled to exemplary costs and damages, no concrete evidence has been produced to prove damages or exemplary costs, the judge said. Furthermore, the order stated that there had been no recovery of infringing goods, therefore, the German sportswear company was entitled to nominal damages of Rs 3 lakh as the defendants had abstained from participating in the court proceeding from the stage of leading their evidence.
It also awarded Adidas AG Rs 11.22 lakh towards other costs, including litigation costs.
The high court order came on a
trademark infringement
petition by Adidas, manufacturer and distributor of
sports accessories
and apparel under the trademark ""ADIDAS"". It had alleged that the three domestic firms in “bad faith, with dishonest intent had commenced using an identical term “ADIDAS” for their textiles business.” The name ""ADIDAS"" was formed by the founder of its company Adolf Dassler by combining his name ""Ad"" with the first three letters of his surname ""Das,"" the
German company
said, adding that the sales figures of its products in India amounted to Rs 335.81 crore in 2009.

On the other hand, the directors of Adidas Weaving Mills and other firms led one partner Keshav H. Tulsiani argued that the rationale for choosing a name identical to that of the German company was rooted in personal affection. From childhood, one of the directors, Keshav held deep admiration for his elder sister, addressed as ""ADI"" in the Sindhi community. This admiration was so profound that he was commonly described as her devotee ""Das"" in Sindhi. Consequently, the term ""ADIDAS"", which meant devotee of elder sister, was conceived, combining ""ADI"" and ""DAS"", to reflect this familial devotion, the domestic firms submitted.
They also argued that the sportwear giant acknowledged awareness of their use of the trademark since 1987 as no suit for infringement was initiated until 2011. This prolonged period of inaction, spanning over two decades, implies a tacit consent to the Defendants’ use of the mark, Keshav said.
“Given this context, initiating a suit after such a significant delay not only undermines the urgency normally associated with trademark infringement claims but also signals an abandonment of any objections to the defendants’ use. Consequently, the Plaintiff’s claim is barred by principles of delay, estoppel, acquiescence, and waiver, each underscoring the unreasonable delay and its prejudicial impact on the defendants,” the firms argued.

Indian cotton spinning industry expected to recover in FY25: ICRA Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/indian-cotton-spinning-industry-expected-to-recover-in-fy25-icra-report/articleshow/111782851.cms,16-07-2024,"ICRA
expects the domestic
cotton spinning industry
to recover in FY2025, growing by 6-8%, supported by 4-6% volume growth and mild realisation gains. This follows two consecutive years of de-growth on the back of subdued
domestic demand
and falling
yarn realisations
. Over two-thirds of the total cotton yarn produced is consumed domestically, where green shoots of recovery are visible from the downstream segments, such as readymade garments and home textiles. Exports, which rebounded in FY2024 on a lower base, are likely to normalise in FY2025. While the
exports
will remain exposed to headwinds from sluggish global demand, a shift in sourcing preference away from other countries will offset this impact to an extent.
Domestic
cotton prices
, which peaked sharply in H1 FY2023 and reached a lifetime high of Rs. 284 per kg, have been declining over the last two years. The average prices, which fell by 26% Y-o-Y in FY2024 amid moderation in global prices and weak demand from the end-user segments, are likely to marginally increase in the near term with a recovery in demand and an expected reduction in the cotton sown area. Cotton yarn prices, too, have been declining since June 2022 amid softening cotton fibre prices and slowing demand from the downstream segments. ICRA expects the
cotton yarn prices
to rise marginally in FY2025 and remain exposed to the vagaries of demand.
Commenting on this, Mr. K Srikumar, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head, of Corporate Sector Ratings, ICRA, said: “The operating income of Indian cotton spinning companies is estimated to improve by 6-8% in FY2025 with a recovery in domestic demand and marginal rise in yarn realisations. The gross contribution margins for spinners, which contracted sharply by ~20% YoY in FY2024 amid weak domestic demand, recovered by an estimated ~5% in Q1 FY2025 and the recovery trend is likely to continue for the remainder of FY2025. Accordingly, ICRA expects the operating profit margins to expand further by 100-150 bps, supported by scale benefits and the cost-saving measures undertaken by industry players.”
The industry had incurred high debt-funded capex in FY2023, partly due to the deferment of major capital expenses during the Covid period (FY2020-21). Consequently, the industry’s coverage metrics deteriorated in FY2023 with a drop in yarn demand in H2 FY2023. The spinners have halted major capex plans in the near term due to weak domestic demand and lower realisations in FY2024. ICRA, however, expects a marginal pick-up in capex announcements in FY2025, driven by the modernisation requirements of types of machinery, the flow of demand from the China Plus One scheme, and improvement in domestic demand from downstream apparel companies.
“
The industry leverage levels rose in FY2024, primarily due to the increase in short-term borrowings available to fund the incremental working capital requirements. The leverage levels are expected to reduce with better cash accruals and the expectation of minimal capex spending. Consequently, the industry’s debt protection metrics shall witness some improvement – the total outside liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is expected to improve marginally to 0.6 times in FY2025 (0.7 times in FY2024), while the total debt to operating profit ratio shall improve to 2.5-3.0 times from 3.5-4.0 times in FY2024.

"Budget 2024: Sitharaman can help weave Indian textile industries' golden fortune with PLI extension to garment sector, MSME funding",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/budget-2024-sitharaman-can-help-stitch-indian-textile-industries-golden-fortune-with-pli-extension-to-garment-sector-msme-funding/articleshow/111502300.cms,05-07-2024,"India is the world’s sixth largest textile and apparel exporter having an 11.4 per cent share in India’s overall exports. The government aims to achieve $600 billion of
textile exports
by 2047 from $44 billion in FY22. However, this one's a bumpy road for the Modi government. Will
Budget 2024
be able to push the sector towards its goals?
India also aims for the domestic market to grow to $1.8 trillion from $110 billion in 2022 owing to a rise in e-commerce and fast fashion. Furthermore, the domestic market is seen growing to $250 billion by 2030 and exports to $100 billion.
Global exports of textiles and apparel has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 3.4 per cent in 2018- 2022 but India’s exports during this period have grown around 1 per cent only. Geo-political uncertainties, consumption shift to other essential and discretionary spends, adverse demographics, and low overall growth of this segment have led to this slow growth.
Textiles sector stained by a few key issues
The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the Red Sea crisis and the Israel-Hamas conflict, have lately made the international trade scenario much tougher for the Indian exporters.
In a report published by CRISIL in February this year, it was noted that the textiles industry is unlikely to be significantly impacted by the Red Sea crisis. However, a prolonged crisis is likely to dent margins and stretch the working capital cycle, it had said.

It is worth to note that the higher freight cost due to the Houthi disruption maybe a hindrance for textile exporters with a lot of trade happening through the Suez Canal. The freight rates increased by nearly 40-50 per cent, as per a TOI report.
Additionally, a global 'weak demand' in textiles is another worrisome factor for the industry. The May 2024 ITMF Global
Textile Industry
Survey (GTIS) revealed a continued stagnation in the textile business climate and that a weak demand remains the main concern since September 2022.
Inefficiency in PLI
The government, in 2021, had approved the Rs 10,683 crore PLI scheme for textiles for five years to promote the production of man-made fibre apparel, fabrics and products of technical textiles.

Sitharaman may focus on affordable housing in Union Budget, says former HDFC CEO Keki Mistry
The scheme has two parts: Part-1 promotes a minimum investment of Rs 300 crore and minimum turnover of Rs 600 crore per company and the second part envisages a minimum investment of Rs 100 crore and minimum turnover of Rs.200 crore per company.
""As per Quarterly Review Reports (QRRs) as on 30.09.2023, the eligible investment made under the Scheme was Rs 2,119 crore of 30 selected applicants, out of which 12 selected applicants started commercial production, turnover achieved was Rs 520 crore including export of Rs 81 crore and employment generated was 8,214,"" the government in December 2023.
In a recent PLI review meeting, it was noted that the progress as part of the government's glagship scehem has been slower than anticipated in the textiles sector.
What the budget can do for the textiles sector
With the forthcoming budget, the industry may expect the government to address certain key issues and provide measures from finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
Primarily, Modi & Co can provide higher fund allocation to MSME which are 80 per cent of the textile market.
Further, an extension of the PLI scheme for garments sector, which the government is already mulling, may take shape.
Earlier on June 25, Textiles Minister Giriraj Singh said the government is now considering to extend the scheme to the garments sector with a view to boost domestic manufacturing and exports.
Singh said that huge opportunities are there to increase exports and the industry should target $50 billion worth of shipments in the coming years.
The ministry is also looking at reviving Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), which aims to create new parks of international standards. Under the scheme 54 textile parks were sanctioned.

Moreover, it has also called for Gautam Singhania and Nawaz Modi - to step off the board of Raymond until divorce-related issues are settled and the results of an independent investigation are received.
Earlier, The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved Raymond’s composite scheme of arrangement and restructuring involving the demerger of its lifestyle business and the amalgamation of its consumer trading arm, paving way for a more focused and streamlined corporate structure.

The NCLT approval facilitates the separation of demerging entity Raymond and Raymond Lifestyle, which will be the transferee company, with Ray Global Consumer Trading also being integrated into the new structure.
For the quarter ending March 2024, Raymond reported an 18 per cent rise in consolidated profit after tax at Rs 229 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 2024. The company had posted a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 194 crore in the same quarter previous fiscal, Raymond Ltd said in a statement.

The minister suggested the industry to follow 'hub and spoke' model to boost domestic manufacturing.
""I appeal to big industry players to engage with small players in India,"" he said adding the ministry will hold meetings with big players to understand their issues.
Bangladesh and China are the biggest competitors of Indian industry in the sector.
He also called for exploring opportunities to increase exports through e-commerce medium.
Last year, the cross-border e-commerce trade was about USD 800 billion and it is estimated to reach USD 2 trillion by 2030.
Further, the minister suggested the industry establish their own brands instead of becoming suppliers to global brands, besides focusing on green textiles and recycling.
The ministry is also looking at reviving Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP).
The scheme aims to create new parks of international standards. Under the scheme 54 textile parks were sanctioned.
Speaking at the fair, Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) Chairman Sudhir Sekhri said the global headwinds negatively affected Indian apparel exports, despite that Indian apparel export industry was able to hold its own and contain the damage to quite an extent.
AEPC Secretary General Mithileshwar Thakur said that the world economy is expected to register healthy growth and global inflation will also decline steadily, and this indicates that there is a greater chance for Indian apparel exporters to expand its footprint across developed countries in the coming years.
""Indian apparel industry must encash this opportunity and start dreaming big,"" Thakur added.
Gurgaon-based garment firm Cocoon Kapas owner Meenakshi said that huge export opportunities are there for Indian textiles in the global market.
""We are working on natural fibres and there is a healthy demand for our product in countries such as the US and Japan,"" she said, adding that her firm is getting ""good orders from developed countries"".

Gokaldas to invest Rs 300 Cr in Maharashtra fabric unit ahead of possible buyout,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/gokaldas-to-invest-rs-300-cr-in-maharashtra-fabric-unit-ahead-of-possible-buyout/articleshow/111143422.cms,20-06-2024,"Bengaluru-headquartered apparel exporter
Gokaldas Exports Ltd
(GEX) on Thursday announced a strategic tie-up with
BRFL Textiles
, a fabric processing company with a large single-location plant in Tarapur
Maharashtra
. The tie-up involves GEX investing up to Rs 300 crore in BRFL in tranches, starting with Rs 50 crore, with a possible merger of the two companies, to be explored one year from now.
This is the third such
investment
by GEX, since it acquired Dubai based Atraco Group in August 2023, and Matrix Design and Industries Pvt Ltd in February 2024. GEX has also raised Rs 400 crore through a QIP issue in April 2024.
GEX has now agreed to invest in BRFL Textiles by subscribing through Optionally Convertible Debentures (OCD). In its first tranche, GEX will subscribe to OCDs worth Rs 50 crore, and subscribe the remaining OCDs worth up to Rs 300 crore in multiple tranches, later, depending on the funding requirements, the company said in a media statement.
These funds would be utilized mainly to meet the working capital needs, with a smaller portion towards the capex requirements. The company may explore buying it out by June 30 subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and regulatory approvals, the company said.
Gokaldas vice chairman and managing director Siva Ganapathi told ET: “With the strategic investment in BRFL Textiles, we intend to make ourselves more self-reliant in fulfilling our raw material requirements for manufacturing. We believe that investment in BRFL Textiles would accelerate GEX’s growth, leveraging the unique capabilities of BRFL. It is an important strategic step for the company.""

FanCode
cofounder Yannick Colaco said jerseys were a hot selling item for the platform, which offers jerseys and merchandise for the majority of the IPL teams.
""We saw almost a 4x growth in jersey sales compared to last year, but one of the interesting trends has been increased adoption of fan merchandise,"" Colaco said.
FanCode had partnered with Blinkit in Kolkata and Ahmedabad for delivering jerseys to customers within 10 minutes. Nearly half of the platform's sales came from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.
Both Kukreja and Colaco said affordable pricing continues to be the driver of sales in a market where counterfeiting is a big challenge, with fake jerseys being easily available for as low as Rs 100–200 outside stadiums on match days.
Kukreja said playR's omnichannel marketing strategy and selling fan jerseys at an “affordable” price of at Rs 799 apiece has helped drive sales of IPL merchandise.
Colaco noted that offering official jerseys for as low as Rs 599 and quick customisation options played a key role in increasing sales. ""For our partnership with the Gujarat Titans, we’d given the fans an option to get customised jerseys on the spot inside the stadium—a first in IPL,"" he said.
In an earlier interview with ET, Gujarat Titans COO Arvinder Singh said the IPL franchise looks at merchandising as an engagement tool instead of a revenue stream. ""Merchandising is a difficult
revenue stream
to build in India due to counterfeiting,"" he had said.
For the majority of
IPL franchises
, merchandising generates low single-digit revenues.

Labour shortage hits Tiruppur apparel units as migrant workers who went home to vote not willing to return,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/labour-shortage-hits-tiruppur-apparel-units-as-migrant-workers-who-went-to-vote-not-ready-to-return/articleshow/110805458.cms,07-06-2024,"India's 'knitwear capital' Tiruppur is grappling with
labour shortage
as thousands of
migrant workers
who went back to their homeland to cast votes in the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections are not willing to return. The crisis comes at a time when
export enquiries
from the US are showing early signs of recovery.
There is an estimated shortage of 100,000-150,000 workers, largely hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam and West Bengal. These workers think the new government will launch
development projects
in their region, which will create
job opportunities
for them in their home towns.
The labour shortage has prompted
Tiruppur Exporters Association
(
TEA
) to launch a mega job drive. It has also decided to offer higher
wages
to migrant workers if they return.
""In the last three months (March-May), we have seen orders from the US climbing by 10% compared to the same period of the previous year,"" said K M Subramanian, president of TEA. ""Over the past few years, the economic slowdown caused by the Covid pandemic, the US and European economic recession, the Russia-Ukraine war and the resulting industrial recession had hard-hit the apparel export business from Tiruppur. We are witnessing early signs of recovery.""

As the order book position is improving for Tiruppur
garment exporters
, the demand for manpower too has increased. As of today, there is a high demand for tailors, checkers, assistants and merchandisers.
""Due to the seven-phase elections, a whole lot of migrant workers have left Tiruppur,"" said Raja Shanmugam, former president of TEA and a knitwear exporter from Tiruppur. ""Though some of them are returning, a large chunk of them have decided to stay back in their home towns. They feel that post elections, there will be a lot of developmental work in their home towns where they will get jobs.""
For instance, new apparel clusters are coming up in Gorakhpur and Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh. The apparel manufacturers from other states are coming to these areas to set up garment export units. ""So, it will be easier for the workers to get jobs. It is also beneficial for the migrant workers from Bihar and Odisha as they are neighbouring states and travel time to the homeland will be much less,"" said Lalit Thukral, president of
Noida Apparel Export Cluster
.
Keeping this in mind, the TEA president said they have asked the units at Tiruppur to increase the wages by 5-10%, depending on the size and manufacturing capacity of the unit.

""We will be looking at more focused attention on products which have greater export potential and the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme is focused on those globally traded products,"" the textiles secretary told
PTI
.
Shah also outlined other measures being looked at to promote exports from the
sector
, including ""possibly looking at newer markets"".
She said the free
trade
agreements (FTAs), which India has entered into with other nations ""hopefully will open up more opportunities"" for the textiles exports.
Sharing the outlook for outward shipments from the textiles sector, Shah said: ""We should look at higher exports happening now. The
global demand
also will start looking better. Already in the first quarter we have seen some of our exporters have reported that the order positions for apparel, made-ups etc, is looking up so that should play out"".
India has been losing ground in global garments trade to countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam due to their lower labour costs, larger operation footprints, and benefits from free trade agreements.

There is a big new star in Indian men's apparel market,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/there-is-a-big-new-star-in-indian-mens-apparel-market/articleshow/109696363.cms,29-04-2024,"There is a new king in
men's apparel market
in India -- traditional wear. Soaring sales of men's traditional wear, including sherwanis, have led to intense competition among brands and drawing in big organised businesses -- such as
Aditya Birla Fashion
,
Vedant Fashions
and
Raymond
-- into the game. As a result of aggressive scale-up by companies, sales in this segment have jumped by as much as 25% in the past three years, ToI reported on April 29.
During the period under review, sherwanis have emerged as a standout category, making up more than a quarter of all sales, the report (by Rupali Mukherjee) said quoting Ashish Mukul, brand head at Tasva.
The sales surge is primarily a result of India-wide rapid retail expansion and the introduction of differentiated designs tailored to meet consumer preferences, industry people say.
During the past two years, Aditya Birla Fashion, which markets Tasva, and Ethnix of Raymond, have collectively opened approximately 183 stores, including around 94 stores by Vedant Fashions, better known as Manyavar. In the upcoming two years, these two brands are expected to open around 300 stores, as per estimates by I-Sec.
The report mentioned that the success of Vedant Fashions' listing has increased competition in the wedding-wear segment from other branded players. In FY22, Aditya Birla Fashion launched Tasva in collaboration with fashion designer Tarun Tahilani, while Raymond introduced Ethnix in FY19 and began scaling up significantly from FY22 onwards.
Live Events
The ToI report said quoting Vedant Modi, chief revenue officer, Vedant Fashions: ""In the last three years, sales of men’s wedding wear, including sherwanis, have grown by approximately 20-25%, indicating a rising demand. This trend underscores the significant role weddings play in driving sales of ethnic wear. The increase in sales is consistent across all types of wedding apparel, showcasing strong market performance and consumer interest in our offerings. The premium segment of wedding wear is experiencing substantial growth, driven by the aspirational nature of weddings. Consumers are opting for higher-quality products for special occasions, driving robust growth in our luxury brand, Twamev.""
In the financial year 2023, the Indian men’s apparel market was estimated to be over Rs 2.2 lakh crore, with a growth rate of almost 10% compound annual growth rate from the financial year 2015 to 2020. However, the pandemic led to a decrease of 3.6% from the financial year 2020 to 2022. Nevertheless, it is observed to have experienced a significant recovery and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 18% for the upcoming four years, as per the analysis by consulting firm Technopak. Ethnic wear constitutes approximately 6% of the total men’s clothing and is anticipated to experience a compound annual growth rate of almost 20% in the following four years.
An expanding middle class, increase in discretionary spending and consumer demographics are strong growth drivers for the apparel market. Further, the premium segment is experiencing significant growth, in particular, sherwanis.
Customers have become more discerning and well-informed about Indian clothing, giving more importance to thoughtful designs and focusing on comfort as well as luxury. As a result, brands have successfully entered this growing market by offering high-quality designs to a larger audience, according to industry experts.
Apart from that, kurtas and kurta sets are also highly popular items in ethnic apparel. Factors such as enhancing the network and introducing new competitive offerings contribute to the growth. Physical stores continue to be the main sales channel, accounting for around 90% of the market.

Indian wear business slows down in times of fast fashion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/indian-wear-business-slows-down-in-times-of-fast-fashion/articleshow/109481898.cms,22-04-2024,"Danish fashion retailer Bestseller is shutting down its Indian
ethnic wear
brand Indifusion, which it had acquired three years ago, amid mounting losses and falling demand. The move also signals a larger
slowdown trend
in the overall ethnic wear segment since last year, said retailers and mall owners. Bestseller said the brand's sales did not meet expectations or ambitions and, therefore, they decided to make strategic adjustments and realign its focus.
Bestseller, known for its
western casual brands
such as Jack and Jones and
Vero Moda
, purchased Indifusion in a distress sale during the peak of the pandemic but had no prior experience in operating an
Indian wear
label. ""For a western brand company, understanding the Indian wear segment is challenging and time consuming too. Also, there has been a general slowdown in the discretionary segment including apparel, which worsened its revival plan,"" said an industry executive.
Over the past two decades, a shift from ready-to-stitch clothing to ready-to-wear along with the entry of national players like BIBA, W, AND, and Global Desi has propelled the growth in
branded apparel
helped by a significant shift away from traditional sarees towards ethnic wear and western wear. In India, ethnic wear is the single biggest category in the women's wear segment with a share of 71% despite global fashion brands such as Zara, H&M and Uniqlo pushing westernised clothing in their market.
""Indian wear is now reduced to just being bought for occasions, which led to a flat category growth over the past four quarters compared to western wear, which expanded at a double-digit rate,"" said Devarajan Iyer, chief executive of Lifestyle International.
The women's
ethnic wear market
is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 8% between FY23 and FY26 and cross $22 billion by FY26, according to Wazir Advisors.

India's textile exports face second consecutive year of decline amid geopolitical strains,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/indias-textile-exports-fall-for-second-year-in-a-row-due-to-geopolitical-issues/articleshow/109423799.cms,19-04-2024,"India
's
textile exports
experienced a setback for the second consecutive year in 2023-24, reported TOI on Friday. The decline can be attributed to geopolitical tensions casting a shadow on the
global economy
.
In the fiscal year 2023-24, exports amounted to $34.4 billion, marking a decline of over $1 billion (3%) compared to the previous fiscal year. Additionally, exports saw a significant drop of 16.3% compared to the fiscal year 2021-22, when the country reported exports worth $41 billion, the TOI report stated.
Within the textile sector, the segment encompassing cotton yarn, fabrics, made-ups, and handloom products witnessed a notable year-on-year increase in exports by $740 million in 2023-24 over the previous year, attributed to a surge in
cotton yarn
exports. According to data from the NIRYAT portal of the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, North America led total textile exports at $11 billion, followed by Europe at $10 billion, and West Asia and North African countries at $4 billion.
Israr Ahmed, vice president, Federation of Indian
Export
Organisations (FIEO) said, the overall western economy has taken a hit, especially in terms of recession in some parts of the globe. “This has caused a drop in consumer confidence in those countries. The persisting Red Sea crisis has escalated sea freight by about 100%, while air freights have gone up by up to 200% due to the demand for ferrying goods through air cargo. However, the fall in textile exports is being corrected since the decrease in exports between FY22 and FY23 has reduced when compared with
FY24
,” TOI quoted Ahmed as saying.
In the segment of readymade garments, which accounts for 42% of combined textile exports, there was a 10% decrease in FY24 compared to the previous year.
Live Events
Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary-General of the Apparel Exports Promotion Council (AEPC), expressed optimism for a recovery, citing recent months' improvements and anticipated benefits from FTAs signed between India, the UK, and the EU, along with government initiatives like the PLI Scheme and PM MITRA Park to boost production capabilities.
“The past two months have seen a recovery despite global headwinds. The industry is bullish that the value of (apparel) exports will reach $20 billion in the current financial year because we are hopeful of FTAs signed between India, the UK and the EU. The PLI Scheme for Man-Made Fibre apparel and fabrics and the seven PM MITRA Park will boost our production capabilities in the textile sector,” he said.
The textile hub of Tirupur, known for its knitwear, has faced a notable decline in exports from $4 billion in FY22 to $3 billion in FY24. Raja M Shanmugam, former president of the Tiruppur Exporters Association, attributed this decline to reduced demand for value-added garments in the US and Europe, emphasizing the need for government support to prevent MSMEs from exiting the sector.
“Our exports to the US and Europe has been affected as purchasing new value-added garments has become the least priority for customers particularly in Europe. The situation in Tirupur is worse than the Covid crisis, which is unprecedented and unwarranted. The government should announce the Government Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme for the textile sector to prevent the MSMEs from exiting their business and moratorium for their dues for six months,” he said.

Industry has raised challenges of raw material for achieving the $350 billion export aim for apparels besides the need for an investment policy for textiles and a mission mode plan for supply augmentation.
Promotion of domestic brands and suppliers as global champions and a mission on quality entailing the enhancement of productivity of natural fibres are being deliberated as part of the plan. Focus could also be given to indigenous machinery manufacturing, self-reliance in high-tech and high value exports and a self sustaining indigenous supply chain.
Moreover, milestones for 2030 are also under consideration wherein domestic market is seen growing to $250 billion by 2030 and exports to $100 billion.
The vision includes making India a global leader in sustainable manufacturing with 30% share of global recycled fibres and setting up a new segment of the value chain-textiles recycling and waste management. Developing textiles knowledge hub and centres of excellence for national tech creation and sharing of intellectual property rights are also being discussed.
2047 would be the 100th year of India's Independence.
""The moment a new government comes, a 100-day plan and then a long-term plan till 2047 could be announced,"" said another person aware of the deliberations.

copyrights
, trademarks and patents in technical textiles, which are meant for non-aesthetic purposes. The
textiles ministry
has proposed 10 years of exclusive rights for the industry to commercialise the
intellectual property
(IP) if their funding contribution is at least 50% in projects funded under the
National Technical Textiles Mission
(NTTM). Similarly, the industry would get exclusive rights for two years for contributing at least 10% in the projects.
As per the draft rules, the IP of the research outcome will generally vest with the host institution on behalf of the ministry. For all Indian patents, the government will have march-in rights, including the option of compulsory licence, in case of any exigency arising for the patent and technology to protect the interest of public, it said.
The ministry has sanctioned 137 projects valuing around ?474 crore under the NTTM.
""The idea is to streamline the financial and technical contributions from industry for IPR generation to encourage industry participation,"" said an official.

In case of IP purely owned by an industry based on which an academic or public-funded institution is involved in a joint project, any new IP generated by the academic institution may be licensed for two years to the industry on an exclusive basis, according to the draft that ET has reviewed. Beyond two years, after duly assessing the milestone achievements and royalty realisation, the IP can either be considered for further renewal with the same industry on mutually agreeable terms or made to any interested party, it said.
The official added that it is important that the technology and items developed through government funding are affordably priced for public interest.
As per the draft, the government will recover through royalties the industry's contribution made in projects for indigenous manufacturing of machinery, tools and equipment for
technical textiles
along with the financial contribution of 50% of the total project cost.

NCLT admits insolvency plea against yarn maker Shrivallabh Pittie Industries,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/nclt-admits-insolvency-plea-against-yarn-maker-shrivallabh-pittie-industries/articleshow/108607462.cms,19-03-2024,"The National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) in Mumbai has admitted a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) against over a century-old textile maker
ShriVallabh Pittie
(
SVP
) group’s affiliate
Shrivallabh Pittie Industries
Ltd in an application filed by the
State Bank of India
.
The lender had approached the tribunal after the company defaulted on its dues of about Rs 90 crore. The tribunal has also appointed Mukesh Verma as resolution professional.
Mumbai-headquartered Shrivallabh Pittie Industries manufactures polyester, polyester & cotton blend, and 100% cotton yarn.
“The application made by the financial creditors is complete in all respects as required by law,” said the division bench of Justice VG Bisht and a technical member Prabhat Kumar. “Therefore, the debt and default stand established and there is no reason to deny the admission of the petition. Moreover, the contention of the corporate debtor (Shrivallabh Pittie Industries) that the present petition is barred by limitation does not stand since the balance sheets and various agreements between the parties produced before us constitute an acknowledgement of the debt,” said the bench in its order of March 7.
Before the tribunal’s order, the lender through its counsel Subir Kumar argued that a total of Rs 193 crore towards working capital facilities and Rs 275 crore towards term loan facilities was granted to the company by the
SBI
consortium, out of which, Rs 126 crore towards working capital facilities and Rs 100 crore towards the term loan was granted by the financial creditor (SBI) to the corporate debtor.

While countering this, the company argued through its lawyers that the account of the corporate debtor (Shrivallabh Pittie Industries) had been wrongfully declared as NPA (non-performing asset) because the financial creditor (SBI) had been accepting the instalments of amounts from the respondent, even after the date of default.
The tribunal in its order observed that the essential ingredients required to initiate CIRP against the corporate debtor such as financial debt and default under the IBC are proved by the financial creditor beyond reasonable doubt in the present case.

Centre relaxes quality control regime on steel and textiles,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/centre-relaxes-quality-control-regime-on-steel-and-textiles/articleshow/108437933.cms,12-03-2024,"The
centre
has exempted inputs used in
products
meant for
export
from
quality control
orders (QCOs) issued by the
Steel
Ministry. According to a gazette notification, this
relaxation
has also been extended to QCOs issued by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), and the
Textiles
Ministry.
These changes have been made by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade to the Foreign Trade Policy, 2023.
Under the quality control regime, manufacturers need to get prior approvals from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certifying compliance for selling regulated items in the country. Import of goods under the QCO
regime
is also restricted and only pre-certified products can be brought into the country.
In February this year, the Centre introduced a fresh QCO for 145 steel products. The latest notification superseded an existing one which covered 111 products from stainless steel pipes and tubes to primary cells and primary batteries parts. Most aspects of the QCO, such as specifications for steel wire for staples, pins, and clips, were applicable with immediate effect.
The QCO also stated that substandard or defective steel and steel products, which do not conform to the specified standards, will be disposed of as scrap. The over covers steel chequered plates, mild steel for metal arc welding electrodes and mild steel wire rods for general engineering purposes, among others.

Wednesday said that the
government
would take firm action against businesses selling
machine-made products
under the ‘
Handmade in India
’ label, to protect the
handicraft
and
handloom
sectors.
At a meeting with stakeholders of the textiles sector, he said the government is willing to procure the harvest of jute and cotton farmers if the market price is lower than the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) and it is working towards increasing the production of jute and cotton and provide quality seeds, fertiliser for quality produce to fulfill the vision of farms to foreign exports.
“The minister noted that businesses selling machine-made products under the ‘Handmade in India’ label should be penalised and said that the government would take firm action to protect the handicraft and handloom sectors,” the textiles ministry said in a statement.
Urging the artisans to register their businesses on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), Goyal said that he has instructed GeM to register all artisans and weavers connected with handicraft and handloom without any registration fee.
Registering on the e-marketplace will boost the visibility of artisans and help promote businesses enhancing their income, he said, adding that the government would try to facilitate the GeM-registered businesses to be onboarded on major e-commerce websites in the country and push for registering their businesses on foreign websites prioritising handicraft and handloom.

Axis Bank and State Bank of India have provided non-fund-based limits and working capital loans of Rs 100 crore each.
The NCCRPS is structured such that it offers a 9% dividend and would be redeemed in 20 years.
Alok Industries
has a direct synergy with
RIL
's retail ventures, where textile products manufactured by AIL are also marketed through Reliance Retail's Fashion and Lifestyle segments.
According to a rating report by Care Ratings, Alok Industries' liquidity is primarily driven by support from its parent, RIL, which provided credit support when it incurred losses in FY23 and 9MFY24. ""This has resulted in positive cash flow from operations for ensuring timely debt repayments,"" it said.
CARE Ratings
expects AIL to generate adequate cash accruals to service its external debt obligations.
ET has sought response from Reliance Industries.

"Expeditious roll-out of PM MITRA to help attract large investments, FDI in textiles: Experts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/expeditious-roll-out-of-pm-mitra-to-help-attract-large-investments-fdi-in-textiles-experts/articleshow/108176565.cms,03-03-2024,"Expeditious implementation of the ambitious scheme to develop seven PM Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel (PM MITRA) parks will help in attracting large
investments
, including
FDI
, in the sector besides generating huge
employment
, said industry experts. After inaugurating '
Bharat Tex 2024
', one of the largest-ever global textile events to be organised in the country,
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
threw light on the government's expansive plans to create seven
PM MITRA
parks in various states and underlined the emphasis on the creation of opportunities for the entire textile sector.
The parks are coming up in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Nearly Rs 70,000 crore investment and 20 lakh employment generation is envisaged through these parks.
The valuation of the Indian
textiles
market is estimated at Rs 12 lakh crore.
The Union Ministry of Textiles is overseeing the execution of these projects. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) owned by the Centre and state governments is being set up for each park, which will oversee the implementation of the project.
Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary General, Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), said the PM MITRA parks seek to address the traditional as well as emerging challenges that the textiles industry has been facing for a long time. These parks will bring together the entire textile value chain under one roof deriving inspiration from the PM's 5F vision -- farm to foreign via fiber, fabric, and fashion focus.

PM MITRA parks will create an enabling ecosystem by facilitating the provision of all utilities, reliable power supply, water availability, wastewater disposal system, and an effective single window clearance for all the regulatory approvals for land, building, electricity, CETP, and other common facilities at a single place, Thakur said.
""Integration of entire textiles value chain right from spinning, weaving, processing, dyeing, printing and garmenting under these parks will lead to substantial reduction of logistics cost. This park will not only attract investments, including FDI, but also create huge employment opportunities in the sector,"" he said.
The textiles ministry will provide financial support in the form of the development capital support up to Rs 500 crore per park to the SPV.
Chairman of Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) Rakesh Mehra opined that the PM MITRA scheme has been one of the pioneering initiatives for capacity building and attracting new investments. The scheme mandate rightly captures the industry's requirements for cluster-based production with value chain presence and hub and spoke models aimed at each PM MITRA park.
This, he said, is a very important aspect not just for meeting production efficiency and logistic efficiency, but also as a sustainable model as it significantly reduces the carbon footprint which the textile industry presently has because of the dispersed nature of the various segments -- from fiber to garment.
""However, the industry looks forward to a faster implementation of the scheme as the industry presently does not have any important investment promotion scheme to address the need of capacity building for meeting the target of doubling the textile base to USD 350 billion by 2030,"" Mehra said.
Rating agency
ICRA
in a recent report had said that investments in the textile value chain under PLI scheme and PM MITRA park and China Plus One strategy are expected to be the key growth drivers.
PM MITRA parks will offer an opportunity to create an integrated textiles value chain and encourage capacity additions in the segment, ICRA said in its report on apparel and fabrics.
A Competitive Incentive Support (CIS) up to Rs 300 crore per park to the units in PM MITRA park shall also be provided to incentivise speedy implementation.
Convergence with other GOI schemes shall also be facilitated to ensure additional incentives to the Master Developer and investor units.
Under the project, state governments where the parks are being established are supposed to provide contiguous and encumbrance-free land parcels of at least 1,000 acres and will also facilitate the provision of all utilities, reliable power supply, and water availability and waste water disposal system, an effective single window clearance as well as a conducive and stable industrial/textile policy.

Standing Committee on Labour
,
Textiles and Skill Development
Wednesday suggested the
government
to come up with an umbrella policy approach for the cotton sector, a
comprehensive policy
with regard to reviving the
closed jute mills
or setting up new mills and explore the markets other than the UAE, US and EU for
silk exports
to “gainfully compensate” for any dip in the
value of exports
.
“The committee have recommended that the government should, instead of foregoing revenue by scrapping of
import duties
, should incentivise the cotton growing farmers of the country and handhold them irrespective of the cotton growing zone of the country to which they belong to,” the committee said.
It asked the ministry to commission a comprehensive study on the issues relating to production, productivity, soil system, and should contemplate for bringing more area of cotton cultivation under irrigation.
Considering the fact that the jute sector occupies an important place in the national economy and provides direct and indirect employment and source of livelihood to millions of people including a large number of women and rural population, the committee has asked the
textiles ministry
to expedite formulation
of National Textile Policy and complete the exercise within a definite timelines.

Separately, the Committee on Estimates (2023-24) on Empowerment through PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks Scheme has recommended the government to consider extending duty exemptions including CGST reimbursements and import duty rationalizations to curb low cost and undervalued import of Chinese knitted fabric.

Gokaldas to buy out knitwear maker Matrix Design for Rs 489 cr in part-cash deal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/gokaldas-to-buy-out-knitwear-maker-matrix-design-for-rs-489-cr-in-part-cash-deal/articleshow/107365055.cms,02-02-2024,"Bengaluru-based apparel manufacturer
Gokaldas Exports
has signed up with Gurugram-based
Matrix Clothing
, proposing to buy 100% of its equity in Matrix Design & Industries for Rs 489 crore. The deal would involve
Gokaldas
paying for equity worth Rs 247.5 crore by way of a share swap and Rs 86.48 crore in cash.
The share swap-plus-cash deal pegs the enterprise value of the company at Rs 489 crore. The equity value, net of debt, is pegged at Rs 333.98 crore. Post buyout transaction, Matrix will hold 4.31% equity in the apparel exporter.
This is the second acquisition announced by Gokaldas in the current financial year. In August, it announced the acquisition of UAE based apparel maker Atraco.
Matrix, a profitable company, manufactures men’s, women’s, and children’s knitwear apparel for global brands with exposure to Europe, the UK, and North America. It operates four units in Gurugram and one in Ranchi.
The deal would help Gokaldas gain access to the knit apparel business segments, a mutually exclusive global customer base, greater access to European and the UK markets, geographical diversification and low-cost capacity expansion potential in the future, the company vice-chairman Siva Ganapathi told ET. “While we are into woven fabric and more US-centric, Matrix makes premium embellished knitwear and Europe-focussed.”
Live Events
“The acquisition of Matrix is an important step for us as it is strategically relevant, possesses a good complementary customer base, operationally strong, and above all, it is a leader in its own sphere,” Ganapathi said.
“The acquisition will give us cross-selling opportunities. We are building our own modern knit mill at Erode in Tamil Nadu which we hope to commission in the next quarter. We will supply raw material from here to Gurugram and Rachi,” he added.
He was happy his company grew its export business 6% year-on-year in the December quarter while India’s apparel exports dipped 12% in the same period. “We are bucking the trend though the overseas market is not that great. But we are seeing signs of buying sentiments picking up as the inventory in the US market is depleting.”
Gokaldas ended the December quarter with a revenue of Rs 559.8 crore, registering 6% growth over the same period last year and with a net profit of Rs 30.4 crore, a year-on-year decline of 25%. “Our performance reflects a good recovery, both on a YoY and sequential basis, as we have overcome most of the business headwinds prevalent in the previous quarters. We intend to build on the revival and continue the growth momentum. We will stay focused on improving operating parameters and remain confident in the medium to long- term prospects of the company,” Ganapathi said.
The company ended the December quarter with a headcount of 32,000 people in India and 11,000 employees in Kenya and Ethiopia.

Tiruppur
apparel industry is on the brink of a labour crisis as thousands of
migrant
workers from
Uttar Pradesh
are returning to their homeland amid increasing job opportunities there, particularly after the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
Migrant workers constitute half of the estimated 600,000 workers at
apparel
units in this textile city in Tamil Nadu and about 60,000 of them have already left.
“There has been a 20% exodus of migrant workers from Tiruppur garment manufacturing units. That is a matter of concern,” said K M Subramanian, president of Tiruppur Exporters Association (
TEA
).
To stop this exodus, the association is looking to improve the living conditions of migrant workers in the city. It has created a forum that will consider various options including housing societies, better medical facilities, wage hikes and timely payment of wages for the migrant labourers,
Subramanian said
.
Raja Shanmugam, owner of knitwear company Warsaw International and past president of TEA, said ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Ayodhya will attract Rs 60,000 crore investments in the next two years, there’s a feeling among migrant workers that it is best to return to their homeland so that they can live closer to the family and earn their daily bread as well.

Migrant workers at Tiruppur apparel units – whose exports stood at Rs 34,350 crore in FY23 – largely come from
UP
, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.
Noida gains
Tiruppur’s loss has been a gain to apparel units in Noida in Uttar Pradesh.
“We are not feeling the heat of shortage of labourers anymore,” said Lalit Thukral, president of Noida Apparel Export Cluster. “The workers are returning and joining us.”
The Noida apparel cluster houses 3,000 units and in the current fiscal, it aims to achieve an export revenue of Rs 40,000 crore.
Also, new apparel clusters are coming up in Gorakhpur and Bundelkhand in UP, Thukral said.
“The apparel manufacturers from other states are coming to these areas to set up garment export units,” he said. “So, it will be easier for the workers to get jobs. It is also beneficial for the migrant workers from Bihar and Odisha as they are neighbouring states and travel time to homeland will be much less.”
An improvement in law-and-order situation in Uttar Pradesh is also prompting businesses to set up manufacturing units in the state, industry officials said.

The present extension up to March 2026 would help in enhancing export competitiveness of
garment
and made-up sectors.
""It makes apparel/garments and made-up products cost-competitive and adopt the principle of zero-rated export. The other textile products not covered under the RoSCTL are eligible to avail the benefits under RoDTEP along with other products,"" the statement said.
The scheme for Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) provides for refund of taxes, duties and levies that are incurred by exporters in the process of manufacturing and distribution of goods and are not being reimbursed under any other mechanism at the Centre, state or local level.
The scheme is based on an internationally acceptable principle that taxes and duties should not be exported, to enable a level-playing field in the international market for exports.
""Hence, not only indirect taxes on inputs are to be rebated or reimbursed but also other un-refunded state and central taxes and levies are to be rebated,"" it said.

Apparel exporters seek tax incentives in Budget 2024 to boost manufacturing,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-exporters-seek-tax-incentives-in-budget-2024-to-boost-manufacturing/articleshow/107104061.cms,29-01-2024,"Apparel exporters body
AEPC
on Wednesday sought tax incentives such as uniformity in
GST
and enhanced interest subsidies to boost domestic manufacturing and
India
's outbound shipments. The Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) asked to provide tax concessions to apparel manufacturers adopting Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) and other international quality standards and compliances. The council also sought budgetary support for the branding and marketing of made-in-India products. The
Budget
is scheduled to be presented on February 1.
The council said that interest equalisation rates were revised downward from 3 to 2 per cent for non-MSME (Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprises
) manufacturer exporters under the interest equalisation scheme on pre-and post-shipment export credit.
""High cost of capital has been a major bottleneck for the exporting community. AEPC has requested the government to increase the rates under the scheme to 5 per cent for all the apparel exporters,"" it said, adding it will increase the apparel industry's competitiveness in the international market and enable them to avail necessary working capital.
Regarding the Goods and Services tax (GST), it said that a uniform tax of 5 per cent only should be levied across the entire MMF (Man-Made Fibre) value chain (fibre, yarn and fabric).
Currently, the MMF GST rate on fibre is 18 per cent, yarn 12 per cent, and fabric 5 per cent, resulting in unutilised input credit and consequent liquidity issues for MSME units, the council added.
Live Events
Further, it suggested the government include trimmings and embellishments under
Import of Goods at Concessional Rates
(IGCR) duty rules.
The operations involved in the garment export trade essentially require various kinds of quality trimmings and embellishments (tags, labels, stickers, belts, buttons, linings, inter-linings, etc.) to ensure the desired functionality and aesthetics of garments in the global market.
In order to maintain their brand image, foreign buyers insist on maintaining consistency and quality and avoiding the use of counterfeits. Any deviation in the specification and quality results in the rejection of the shipment, it said.
""Indian apparel exporters are constrained to use only those trimmings and embellishments, which are pre-approved by the buyer and these are mostly required to be sourced from overseas suppliers nominated by the garment buyers,"" the council argued.
As of now, certain trims and embellishment items are not entitled to duty exemption, it said.
""AEPC has submitted a list of items currently not permitted, such as draw cord, elastic band/tape, metal tab/stopper/clip, velcro tape, leather badge, and D-ring, and has requested these items be included in the list for eligibility for duty exemption,"" the AEPC said in a statement.
It has also urged that minimum wastage at the rate of 10 per cent should be allowed under the IGCR rules for the import of trimmings and accessories by issuing an appropriate notification.
This will help apparel exporters submit their utilisation details on time and get the bond executed at the customs release.
""We will look forward to the response of the government on the suggestions made by AEPC, which have been made after wider industry consultations,"" Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary General, AEPC, said.

Apparel retail sector is likely to face another quarter of slowdown: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-retail-sector-is-likely-to-face-another-quarter-of-slowdown-report/articleshow/106417498.cms,31-12-2023,"Apparel
retail sector
is likely to face another quarter of slowdown as most of them have reported flat to low single digit same store sales growth during Q3FY24, according to
ICICI securities
.
This is primarily due to the lower footfall during the peak season, impact of world cup during weekends and late onset of winter season.
As a result, most brands have kicked-off end of season sale offering upto 65% discount, 2 weeks early in December 2023 against normal one month EOSS window in January.
Retail sales in October and November 2023 showed a growth of 7% just as compared to the sales levels during the same period in 2022, according to the survey by Retailers Association of India (RAI).
“We believe higher discounts are reflective of the relative stress in the underlying inventory, and hence, may be a leading indicator of business performance in the near term,” ICICI securities has said in its latest report.

Top-7 retail companies Shoppers Stop, Reliance Trends, Lifestyle, Pantaloons, VMART, Max, Westside are surveyed by the company and at 66% Shoppers Stop is offering the maximum discount against peers at 20-40%.
The discounts offered by Reliance Trends, Lifestyle and Pantaloons stood at 40%, 41% and 42%, respectively. This is largely due to more aggressive private label discounting by Shoppers Stop.
On branded products like W, Aurelia and Biba, the discount offered by Reliance Trends (at 51%) has been the highest compared to 45% offered on the same products by Shoppers Stop, Lifestyle and Pantaloons.
The discount offered by VMART was the lowest at 23%.
100% private label retailers like TRENT and VMART continue to follow strict discounting-window policy as they have not participated in early EOSS.
“We expect TRENT to keep its discounting window short (2-3 weeks) while maintaining focus on selling fresh products rest of the time. We reckon that Westside is experimenting with its EOSS model through late EOSS participation; during Q2FY24 it started EOSS from Aug 1 while its competitors started in Jul 23. Interestingly, Marks and Spencer and Reliance Trends have resorted to reverse strategy; long-period discounting (2 months),” ICICI securities has said.
Over the past 6-8 months, most companies have been either slashing price tags or offering steep discounts to clear unsold inventory after price increases across all apparel categories last year.

Red sea is one of the busiest trade routes that connects Europe and Asia through the Suez Canal and for the last few days, cargo ships passing through the Red Sea are being attacked by militants.
“As a result of the attacks, Ships are reportedly taking a 6000 nautical miles detour around Africa which means an additional 15 days transit time that is causing steep increase in freight rates and insurance premium,” said Bhadresh Dodhia, chairman, Synthetic & Rayon Textiles Export Promotion Council.
Freight rates to European ports from India have already increased by 40% with a strong possibility of further increase which will increase shipping costs for exporters of textiles and clothing, he said.
Highlighting that the deteriorating situation in the Red Sea is a matter of serious concern, Dodhia said if the crisis is prolonged and not contained quickly, it will not only have an adverse impact on exports from India but will severely disrupt the global supply chain and hurt the world economy.

He urged the government to provide support to the textile and clothing exporters as majority of shipments of textiles and clothing pass through the Suez Canal, which connects the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.
This, Dodhia said, is crucial, as freight rates have stabilised in recent times after witnessing a steep increase in rates during Covid-19 and the current crisis in the Red Sea has once again pushed up freight rates, which is not good for the exporters.

Swan Energy repays Rs 40 crore textile unit debt,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/swan-energy-repays-rs-40-crore-textile-unit-debt/articleshow/106327163.cms,27-12-2023,"Swan Energy
Limited (SEL) has made a repayment of debt of Rs 40 crore towards its entire fund-based facilities of textile unit to the consortium of banks led by Union Bank of India. The consortium of banks comprises
Union Bank of India
,
Bank of Baroda
,
Punjab National Bank
and
Mehsana Urban
Co-operative Bank Ltd.
This move is a part of Swan Energy's aim to significantly reduce the debt position in its books. The debt repayment shows Swan Energy’s goal to further strengthen the financial position by efficiently managing the financial obligations.
Swan Group

AI Tailors: Chatbots become virtual stylist to dress you like movie stars,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/ai-tailors-chatbots-become-virtual-stylist-to-dress-you-like-movie-stars/articleshow/106175717.cms,21-12-2023,"For many in the humble 90s in India there would be a fixed market, shop or even a 'family tailor' who were the go-to places for buying garments. Choices were stacked in the racks and parents typically were the biggest decision makers for getting the 90s kids their clothes. Glitzy stores at malls overpowered those local stand-alone shops gradually after the turn of the century and decisions also depended on the mirror tricks in the trial rooms.
But now, it isn't the human choices alone that is deciding what, why, where and how to wear garments. Virtual online shopping, in-store assistants and in-house data analysis combine to make the choice for those 90s kids, or whom we know as the millennials now. While e-tailers became the latest vogue, the paradox of plenty did take over shoppers, who were not restricting the purchases for festivals or specific occasions anymore.
This is where generative AI comes to play.
AI's uses are vast, ranging from cracking critical missions to using deepfakes for scamming people, or even
raising the dead's digital versions as seen in China
. But that's another story.
Fashion brands are increasingly using generative AI, giving the perfect fit to vague ideas of what one wants to wear. Calling it a 'game changer' McKinsey in a report had predicted generative AI could add $150 billion, conservatively, and up to $275 billion to the apparel, fashion and luxury sectors’ operating profits over the next three-to-five years.
Live Events
What the tech's latest revolution does is it helps users search for products very differently than a traditional search engine would work for providing information.
Chatbots on e-tailers convert an abstract user query into actionable results. Usually, when you search for something online, it's best to use specific words like ""blue t-shirt from a certain brand."" But, the chatbot on
Myntra
for instance does more than just regular searching. It uses smart AI to understand broader questions. For example, if you ask for a movie star's outfit, it tries to find something similar. Or if you want clothes for the gym, it helps you find things like sweat-wicking jerseys, snug t-shirts, comfy track pants that let you move freely, shoes to help you run better, fitness bands, and other items that you might not have known you needed when starting out.
“This is big,” said Arit Mondal, director of product management at Myntra, “Why? Because, this is the first time we have a solution, which is solving the unsolved ‘search’ problem in the fashion, beauty and lifestyle industry. And it’s live for customers at scale.”
Earlier this year, Myntra had a hackathon where some engineers from the company's search team used a service called Azure OpenAI to solve a tricky problem - they wanted to change how people search for things online, not just using specific words.
They found that
ChatGPT
, the smart AI they used from Azure OpenAI Service, could understand normal questions. For example, they asked it about an actor's outfit from a recent movie, and it described the clothes like a bomber jacket, gloves, and aviator sunglasses. They were surprised it worked so well.
“And this is the information that Myntra’s existing catalog didn’t have,” said Swapnil Chaudhari, an engineering manager at Myntra.
Chaudhari's team for the next couple of days continued testing different prompts—phrases that the smart AI could recognise—to see what would happen. They were exploring something new, and they weren't sure how much they could experiment with it.
“We were surprised to see the results. It was able to answer questions like clothes to wear for regional festivals like Pongal and Onam,” said Pragna Kanchana, a front-end engineer at Myntra.
Over the next five weeks, multiple teams across engineering and product development fine-tuned both the backend and the user interface for the chatbot, Myntra said.
""The chatbot was launched on the Myntra app in late May, just in time for one of their biggest marquee events, End of Reason Sale (EORS). It included sample prompts that gave users an idea of how they could use conversational language rather than keywords,"" Myntra said in a statement.
The impact that the generative AI chatbot created for Myntra is phenomenal, including chances of boosting sales, they added.
""Users who shop using the chatbot are three times more likely to end up making a purchase,"" said Mondal. ""Because it also helps users discover a complete look from multiple categories of products, we're seeing that on average they add products from 16 percent more categories than usual.""

Arvind Fashions aims to become zero-debt co in two years; piloting new format,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/arvind-fashions-aims-to-become-zero-debt-co-in-two-years-piloting-new-format/articleshow/106170482.cms,21-12-2023,"Arvind Fashions
, which sells products of brands such as
Arrow
,
Tommy Hilfiger
and
Calvin Klein
, aims to become a zero-debt company in the next two years on the back of higher cash flow and focus on franchise-based expansion, said vice chairman
Kulin Lalbhai
.
The Bengaluru-headquartered company has rationalised its brand portfolio, reducing it to five fashion brands from more than 20. It has about Rs 300 crore debt. The management last month told analysts that the company’s net debt at the end of the September quarter was Rs 476 crore.
“We embarked on a full-blown strategy 2-3 years back to create large iconic brands where we will get operational efficiencies and profitability by scaling them up,” said Lalbhai. “After the portfolio restructuring, the business is generating high return on capital employed, highly profitable and generating strong cash flow. If we achieve our business plan, the company will be debt free in two years.”
Managing director and chief executive officer Shailesh Chaturvedi told ET that the company plans to increase the size of its stores for each of the brands by 25%, as it looks to expand into more products for each, such as footwear, kids wear and innerwear, and pilot a new large retail format which will house all its brands under one roof.
Arvind Fashions sells apparel and accessories of brands Arrow, Tommy Hilfiger, U.S. Polo Assn., Calvin Klein and
Flying Machine
through multi-brand apparel stores and over 1,000 exclusive brand stores. While U.S. Polo Assn. is the largest brand with annual sales of more than Rs 2,000 crore, Arrow and Tommy Hilfiger account Rs 1,000 crore of business each, and Calvin Klein and Flying Machine bring in Rs 500 crore each.

The company aims to grow sales by 12-15% annually and improve EBITDA by 100 basis points every fiscal year, said Chaturvedi. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
The company is also piloting a new format over 3,000-4,000 sq ft with one store in Bengaluru where all the five brands are sold under one roof.
“That apart, we intend to open 150-200 exclusive brand stores every year with almost 90% of them through the franchisee route to make it an asset light model,” said Chaturvedi. “However, we will control the operations very tightly.”
Last month, Arvind Fashions sold its wholly owned subsidiary Arvind Beauty Brand Retail, which runs the 26-store-strong Sephora India business to Reliance Retail at an enterprise value of Rs 216 crore. The company had then said it intends to utilise the proceeds to invest in growth of its five brands portfolio and repayment of debt.
“Due to efficiencies, EBITDA grows much faster than revenue and net profit too will grow faster,” said Lalbhai. “We are also looking at adjacencies like footwear, kids-wear and inner-wear as a big segment. Adjacencies currently account for 12-15% of overall business but it can become 25% soon.”
Last fiscal, the company’s revenue went up 45% year-on-year to Rs 4,421 crore, while net profit stood at Rs 88 crore. It had posted a net loss of Rs 104 crore in FY22.

"Gujarat's pro-industry policy, upcoming PM MITRA Park making textile a vibrant sector: Stakeholders",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/gujarats-pro-industry-policy-upcoming-pm-mitra-park-making-textile-a-vibrant-sector-stakeholders/articleshow/106042028.cms,16-12-2023,"The
Gujarat government
's industry-friendly policy, investments attracted through the platform provided by the
Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit
, and the upcoming
PM MITRA Park
in Navsari are set to boost the state's efforts to promote the textile sector, officials and industry leaders said.
With over 60 per cent of the country's denim fabric coming from Gujarat, the state is aptly considered as the textile state of India, they said, adding that the support provided by the state government through its
textile policy
for the last more than a decade has also contributed significantly to the growth of the sector.
Experts say that Gujarat's textile policy has led to technological upgrades, skill enhancement and the development of
textile parks
, making it one of the most vibrant sectors. They believe that Gujarat's textile industry will position itself as a driving force in the state's economic growth and contribute to India's prominence in the global textile market.
According to the state government, the development of PM MITRA Park in Navsari in south Gujarat is poised to attract over Rs 10,000 crore in investments, generating an annual output of Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000 crore. It is expected to elevate the contribution of Gujarat's apparel sector from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, overall textile output from 18 per cent to 22 per cent, and sector exports from around 12 per cent to over 15 per cent, it said.
As a precursor to the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (
VGGS
) 2024, the Gujarat government has so far signed 10 MoUs with textile and apparel manufacturing companies with a combined value of Rs 2,844.93 crore. The MoUs pertain to the manufacturing of knitted products, viscose and polyester staple yarn, polyester films, and manufacturing of composite textile unit and denim dyeing and processing unit, a government release said.

The state government is progressing well to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to make India's textile sector a ""world champion"" and using every opportunity to give a boost to the sector which has emerged as second only to agriculture in employment generation, it said. ""To make a profit in the future, we will have to invest in the local supply chain. This is the way to build a developed India and this is the way to fulfil the dream of a developed India, to fulfil the dream of a 5 trillion economy,"" Modi had said in one of his speeches.
Over the last two decades, the VGGS has been instrumental in providing a platform for notable investments in Gujarat's textile sector. It brings together both domestic and international industry leaders, creating partnerships for projects in the textile industry in Gujarat, industry representatives said.
The textile policy launched by the government in 2012 has attracted over Rs 35,000 crore in investment. Supported by
pro-industry policy
and meetings organised as part of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summits, the sector witnessed a 2.3 times growth in exports by 2019, said Gaurang Bhagat, a textile business owner.
""Because of the meetings organised as part of the Vibrant Gujarat (Summit), the textile sector has seen a lot of improvements. Suggestions were received and beautiful progress made,"" he said. As a result of such a pro-industry approach, production of cotton spindles in Gujarat increased from 10 lakh spindles in 2012 to 46.3 lakh spindles in 2022-23, he said.
Gujarat's textile policy has led to technological upgrades, skill enhancement and the development of textile parks, with a significant focus on rural employment and women's empowerment, making it one of the most vibrant sectors, industry experts said.
In a seminar organised last month in Surat on the theme of 'Future Ready 5F: Gujarat's Textile Vision for Viksit Bharat@2047' ahead of the 10th Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, Minister of State for Textiles Darshana Jardosh announced a strategic focus on developing the technical textile sector with a commitment to the highest quality. She said that the construction of PM Mitra Park in Navsari is anticipated to propel the textile sector to new heights in employment generation.
""The state government has proactively formulated policies addressing labour, industry and textiles, leading to significant advancements in the textile sector,"" she said, while also underscoring the significance of ready-made garments using man-made fibres. The government is actively promoting the development of the textile sector, she added.
During the seminar, Gujarat Minister of State for Industries Harsh Sanghavi said, ""The textile sector has surpassed other industries in generating employment, and the state government is dedicated to making it a hub. Our government values diverse opinions and is committed to implementing effective policies.""
According to Chintan Thaker, chairman of ASSOCHAM's Gujarat Council, the state holds a significant position for textile industry entrepreneurs. The textile sector provides the highest employment after agriculture in the state. In various other sectors, an investment of Rs 1 crore generates employment for 3 to 5 people, while in the textile sector, an investment of the same amount generates employment for 9 to 15 people, he said.
The state has encouraged the development of the textile sector through the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI), RoSCTL scheme (Scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies on Export of Garments and Made-ups), and policies related to Goods and Services Tax (GST) by the government, he said.
Projects such as PM Mitra Park and SagarMala are expected to elevate the contribution of Gujarat's apparel sector from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, overall textile output from 18 per cent to 22 per cent, and sector exports from around 12 per cent to over 15 per cent, the experts said. These proposed projects in and around Surat and Ahmedabad will begin with a projected timeframe by 2025 and are expected to create more than 11,400 employment opportunities, the release said.

Southern spinning mills seek government relief amid global recession,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/southern-spinning-mills-seek-government-relief-amid-global-recession/articleshow/105783768.cms,06-12-2023,"Spinning mills
from
Tamil Nadu
,
Andhra Pradesh
and
Telangana
that account around 55% of the spinning capacity in the country have appealed to the central and state government for relief measures to overcome the financial impact of global recession and sluggish demand in the domestic markets.
“The 11% import duty levied on cotton and the expensive man-made fibre and filament yarns added fuel to the situation and drastically reduced the exports of yarns, fabrics, garments and made-ups,” said
South Indian Mills Association
(
SIMA
) in a release.
It added: “The steep increase in the power cost ranging from Rs 1 per unit up to Rs.2.50 per unit greatly affected not only the global competitiveness but also in the domestic market when compared to Maharashtra,
Gujarat
and Madhya Pradesh that offer huge incentives under their new state textile policies.”
According to SIMA, the high volatility in cotton and yarn prices and the new capacities added in the aforesaid states and drop in exports have made the production capacity surplus and affecting the existing production capacities in the southern states.
The Ministry of Textiles had recommended extending one year moratorium for the repayment of loans and extending adequate financial measures on a case-to-case basis based on the representations made by the spinning sector in across the country.

“Under these circumstances, the long-drawn Ukraine-Russia war, recent Israel-Hamas war and the MMF QCO related issues caused severe financial stress in several countries and further reduced the demands for all the spinning mills across the country,” the release stated.
Dr. S. K. Sundararaman, Chairman, SIMA has said that many associations representing spinning mills and open-endspinning mills was held to discuss and decide the strategies for mitigating the unprecedented crisis. “We have jointly appealed to the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to roll back the power tariff hike brought in the recent years for a period of one year. We have also appealed the state governments to exempt third party power and IEX power purchase from cross subsidy surcharge and additional surcharge.
“Import surge across the value chain at an abnormal degree, more specifically fabrics, garments and made ups from China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Sri Lanka is dampening the core Schemes implemented by the Central Government to promote indigenous-quality manufacturing, in addition to paving way for achieving the targeted US $ 350 billion textile business size (US $ 250 billion domestic market and US $ 100 billion export market),” said SIMA.
According to SIMA, there has been an increase in import to the tune of 40% cotton fibre, 149% viscose fibre, cotton yarn 442%, polyester yarn 46%, viscose yarn 204%, polyester fabrics 46%, garment 44%, made-ups 27% respectively.
Dr. Sundararaman said that the spinning mills’ associations have appealed the Hon’ble
Prime Minister
to extend the one-year moratorium for repayment of the principal loan amount; convert three-year loans under ECLGS into six-year term loans; extend necessary financial assistance to mitigate the stress on working capital, on a case-to-case basis; remove 11% import duty on cotton and address the QCO related issues like exemption for fibre/filament yarns TT that are not manufactured in India, exemption of raw materials imported through advance authorization scheme, provide adequate testing facilities and reduce BIPS certification and testing charges, etc.

Enquiries are up 10-20% over last year due to the improving demand scenario in the US, Australia and the UAE, they said. The US is among the largest importers of textiles along with the European Union.
""We will sustain this growth because the US had reduced buying due to the war and is now low on inventory,"" said Ashok Rajani, founder chairman of Midas Touch Exports. ""We expect growth in the next 4-6 months as the feel-good factor is coming back. The order book is 15-20% better than what it was 4-5 months ago,"" he said.
Exports of cotton fabric, yarn and handloom products were up 5.7% during April-October, compared with April-August period when they were 2% less than last year's levels, according to data from the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry
.
Long way to recovery
However, the industry is yet to reach pre-Covid production levels. Although the gap in production from pre-pandemic levels halved from the start of the year, textile production was still 6.5% lower in September compared to the 2019-20 period, according to data from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (
Mospi
).
Many experts believe a complete recovery to pre-Covid levels is a long way away.
""This uptick is a reflection of inventory pile-up for the festive season in western economies,"" said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at Ind-Ra, referring to production and export spurt in September and October.
Long-term recovery would depend on improving global trade conditions, he added.

India to become Pepe Jeans' largest market in two years: Global CEO Marcella Wartenbergh,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/india-to-become-pepe-jeans-largest-market-in-two-years-global-ceo-marcella-wartenbergh/articleshow/105708093.cms,04-12-2023,"Pepe Jeans
global chief executive officer
Marcella Wartenbergh
said
India
will become its
largest market
in the next two years, outpacing its home country Spain and the UK, helped by
young consumers
increasingly embracing western-style clothing.
""We are seeing accelerated growth in India compared to more mature markets and have outpaced in terms of sales and profit. Also, Gen Z still doesn't have enough money and it is really millennials and Gen Y that will drive the market and we need to make sure the brand fits them,""
Wartenbergh
told ET in an exclusive interaction. ""One of the big advantages that India has is they are very close to the suppliers and that helps to be much faster in innovation.""
For the clothing retailer, which also owns menswear brand
Hackett
, India is the biggest market by volume and accounts for nearly a third of its global sourcing.
Pepe India
sales grew over 50% to Rs 560 crore during the year ended March 2023 but claimed its consumer revenue on price tag is over Rs 1,100 crore.
However, nearly 90% of its sales in India are from menswear compared to 65% in Europe, a salience it wants to change now. The company aims to expand more into footwear and women western wear, a market which is completely dominated by global rivals including
Zara
and H&M.
""We believe women are becoming much more modern in India driven by western influence, and are also playing an important role in business. If our women's wear is just 30% of what we earn from men's merchandise, the numbers will swell,"" added Wartenbergh, who joined in 2019 replacing its earlier CEO Carlos Ortega, a Spanish entrepreneur who still has a stake in the apparel and accessories group. ""So the growth will come by creating new lines, improving our margins, and gaining market share.""

Pepe, the second largest denim brand in the country, operates more than 200 branded outlets and most of them are franchisee run. It was founded by Indian-origin siblings Arun, Nitin and Milan Shah in London in 1973 as a roadside stall in Portobello Road, but has changed hands since. In February 2015, the Pepe Jeans Group was bought by LVMH subsidiary L Capital Asia and M1 Group from a clutch of investors.
India is an attractive market for US and European brands and has, over the past few years, attracted a clutch of the world’s largest apparel brands including Gap and Uniqlo that are banking on young consumers across price-points. In a McKinsey & Company report The State of Fashion 2024 released last week, India emerged as a promising market for fashion, despite the global economic outlook continuing to be unsettled in major markets, directly impacting consumer confidence and spending.
When asked about the regions they believe will be the most promising in the year ahead compared to 2023, executives globally cited the Middle East with 51% net intent, India at 39% net intent compared to and 34% in Asia Pacific, while North America and China recorded 8% and 3% each.

Pepe Jeans London
is aiming for sales of around Rs 2,000 crore from the Indian market and plans to expand its retail network by adding over 100 stores in the next three years, its India MD and CEO Manish
Kapoor
said.
Pepe Jeans
London, owned by Spanish global fashion group
AWWG
, is ""very buoyant"" for the Indian market, and aims to grow at 18-20 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the next three to five years, Kapoor told PTI.
As part of the strategy, Pepe Jeans is now focusing on the expansion of its network of brand stores and fast-growing e-commerce channels. Pepe Jeans expects 55 per cent of its business to come directly by selling to consumers from its own sales channels.
Over Pepe Jeans' expansion plans, Kapoor told PTI, ""We will add 100 odd stores in the next three years and in terms of a turnover, we are looking at a CAGR growth of 18 to 20 per cent. So we should be almost around Rs 2,000 crore of
consumer sales
in three years.""
When asked about sales numbers, Kapoor said: ""If I look at business in India, last year on a consumer sales revenue we did close to Rs 1,200 crore and book revenue of Rs 562 crore. We grew almost 55 per cent as compared to the previous year.""
But more importantly, Pepe Jeans grew almost 42 per cent, as compared to the pre-COVID numbers, he added.

According to Kapoor, in the last two to three years, Pepe Jeans has become a consumer-centric company and is focusing on trends and the digital side of the business.
""We have a very clear focus in terms of direct-to-consumer sales. So whether it is through online or through stores, retail and e-commerce are going to be our biggest focus,"" he said.
Kapoor said Pepe Jeans London is getting a ""bigger proportion"" of its growth coming from small tier II & III markets, amid rising disposable income, exposure to information related to trends for current brands helped by increasing internet penetration etc.
""Today the aspirations of these consumers (tier II & III) are similar to a consumer of a metro city.
""These guys have similar sort of disposable incomes and are willing to buy. e-commerce as a platform has provided us an opportunity where we can reach out to consumers or even cities which are like one lakh sort of population. So, accessibility has also become easier,"" he added.
Currently, the top eight cities contribute to around 58 per cent of the Pepe Jeans business and the rest 42 per cent comes from tier II and below markets.
In the premium denim space, Pepe Jeans London is the second leading brand in the segment. The premium denim space is led by US-based jeans manufacturing brand Levi's.
Pepe Jeans London also owns brands such as Hackett and Faconnable. It is also the licensed distributor for
Tommy Hilfiger
and Calvin Klein in Spain and Portugal.
The brand Pepe Jeans London has been present in India since 1988. KRH DRR

Government cracks the code to track recycled textiles trade,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/government-cracks-the-code-to-track-recycled-textiles-trade/articleshow/105636375.cms,01-12-2023,"India will soon start keeping a record of its export and import of recycled textiles, as the government plans to track the trade of products made from regenerated fibres and measure the growth of the
circular textile economy.
The
textiles ministry
has kick-started the process to create
separate tariff codes
- called HSN (
harmonised system of nomenclature
) codes in trade parlance - as the existing ones do not account for recycled textile products and they are exported and imported in existing yarn, fabric, garment and waste codes.
India's exports of worn clothing and rags in 2022-23 amounted to $134.7 million and imports were $381.71 million. Almost half the imports came from Bangladesh.
""We are trying to capture the trade of recycled textiles as some countries ban or restrict their trade,"" said an official, who did not wish to be identified.
Live Events
Separate HSN codes for recycled textiles will help customs authorities, policymakers and trade organisations to better regulate and manage the trade of these products, besides facilitating compliance with sustainability standards and certifications.
The ministry is already assessing pre-and post-consumer waste generation and its source identification to get an estimate of such waste generated in the country.
""The recycled varieties of yarn, fibre and fabric are there and we want to make HSN codes at six-eight digit levels,"" the official said, adding that India will devise a way first to quantify the trade before taking up this issue with other countries.
The move is in line with the EU's new Circular Economy Action Plan, 2020 which has included textiles as one of the key product value chains facing multiple sustainability challenges.
At present, only four-five companies are being captured which deal with recycled textiles, according to the official.
As per
IMARC Group
, India's textile recycling market size was $308.7 million in 2022 and is expected to reach $375 million by 2028, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% in 2023-2028.
""It is an emerging area and identification of recycled textiles will be important. It will give identity to the recycling segment,"" said Chandrima Chatterjee, secretary general,
Confederation of Indian Textile Industry
.
""Fashion waste and brands' dead stock is the highest of the lot,"" said an industry representative, who did not wish to be identified, adding that the HSN classification will help identify and track their trade and aid transparency in the supply chain.

Manmade fibre textiles exports to rise 75% by 2030: Textile industry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/manmade-fibre-textiles-exports-to-rise-75-by-2030-textile-industry/articleshow/105553793.cms,28-11-2023,"Buoyed by the Production Linked Incentive (
PLI
) scheme and free
trade
agreements with the UAE and Australia, the industry expects India’s
exports
of manmade fibre (MMF)
textiles
to increase 75% to $11.4 billion in 2030 from around $6.5 billion in 2021-22.
India is the second largest producer of MMF after China.
Curtains, drapes and interior blinds, curtain or bed valances of synthetic fibres, tents of synthetic fibres and tarpaulins are some of the products which can drive this growth
“Technical textiles is a sunrise sector and the future of this industry,” said a government official, adding that ambitious targets have been set for it.
Currently, MMF dominates global textile fibre consumption, with a 72% share, while natural fibre accounts for 28%. The share of MMF has been steadily increasing due to the inherent limitations of growth of cotton and other natural fibres.

The industry’s vision includes tapping new markets such as Vietnam, Japan, China and Poland, besides the existing ones, including the US, Turkey, the UK and Brazil, where India has about 5% share in exports of MMF textiles.
The plan is also to improve capacities of filament-based woven and knitted fabrics and processing of man-made filament yarn based fabrics.
“Manmade
fibre textiles
are environment friendly and sustainable as they require less water compared to cotton textiles, are cheaper and more value addition can be done on them,” said Bhadresh Dodhia, chairman, Synthetic & Rayon Textiles Export Promotion Council.
The council has prepared the vision.
Dodhia added that technical textiles are largely made of MMF and changing lifestyles, concern for safety and health will lead to more use of technical textiles.
India maintained its exports share in global trade of MMF textiles at 3.4% from 2016-2021, but the challenge emanates from Bangladesh, Turkey, Cambodia, Vietnam, Pakistan and African countries enjoying duty-free access to all the major markets such as the EU and the US while Indian products attract 10-34% duty.
As per the Confederation of Indian
Textile Industry
, globally, MMF products have about 55% share in global textile trade.

Bharat Tex
exhibition in February aims to showcase the complete

, featuring participants ranging from farmers to fashion designers. The event, held at both Bharat
Mandapam
and the newly constructed Yashobhoomi in the capital, marks India's dedication to becoming a
global textile powerhouse
, combining innovation, collaboration, and the ""Make in India"" spirit.
Timed strategically, the exhibition, covering an expansive two lakh square feet (equivalent to 45 football fields), is anticipated to coincide with the announcement of general elections.
Textiles has been a major focus sector, given the large number of weavers, artisans and workers involved in the sector.
Bharat Tex 2024 represents India's 5F vision, encompassing Farm to Fibre to Factory to Fashion to Foreign.
It emphasizes the nation's readiness to take on global competition in the textile sector, creating
products
not only for India but the entire world.
Live Events
The four-day event is expected to attract global CEOs, policymakers, in addition to over 3,500 exhibitors from around the world, 3,000 overseas buyers from over 40 countries, and more than 40,000 domestic buyers, official sources told TOI.
The textiles ministry, which is working with trade bodies, has reached out to global players such as Chanel, LVMH,
Uniqlo
,
Zara
and Walmart - which is hosting its first global sourcing meeting around the same time - to join the mega event where nearly 100 top Indian brands such as Fabindia, Nalli,
Arvind Mills
and
Raymond
will be showcased as the organisers work on the theme of ""local for global"".
""Indian manufacturers cater to big brands, largely as vendors. We need to create Brand India, as local players should emerge as bigger players on the international scale. That will also help in improving unit value realisation,"" said an industry source.
India is seeking to corner a greater share of the global pie as it targets to push its exports to $100 billion from $45 billion.

"Innerwear, athleisure companies still bet on sops to clear excess stock",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/innerwear-athleisure-companies-still-bet-on-sops-to-clear-excess-stock/articleshow/105454688.cms,24-11-2023,"Demand for
innerwear
and athleisure wear continues to remain weak even as excess inventory forced brands to deep discount their merchandise over the past few quarters, leading innerwear makers said.
Page Industries
, the country's biggest innerwear maker, said accumulation of excess inventory in the segment has had repercussions on the overall ecosystem, resulting in certain unsustainable business practices in the market.
""It is not only the promotions and discounts, but also the schemes which are being deployed in the marketplace. So, it continues to be that way,"" VS Ganesh, managing director of Page Industries said during its second quarter earnings call. ""Though we are seeing some positive trends in consumer demand in the economy and rural segments, aided by the onset of festivities, we are yet to witness any noticeable improvement in the urban and mid-premium segment,"" he said.
Page Industries, which operates
Jockey
and Speedo stores in India, posted an 8.4% decline in its revenue and an 8.8% decline in volume for the quarter ended September.
While rivals
Rupa
and
Lux Industries
saw sales increase of 6% and 1%, respectively, during the quarter, VIP Clothing posted a 2.4% decline in sales.
The overall sluggish demand suggests that the economy may not be doing well, going by the men's underwear index (MUI). As per MUI, an economic index conceived by former US Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan in the late 1970s, declines in the sale of men's underwear indicate a poor overall state of the economy while upswings reflect the opposite.

Indian consumers had started reducing non-essential spending such as that on apparel, lifestyle products, electronics and dining out since Diwali last year due to inflation, increase in interest rates, job losses in some sectors such as startups and IT, and a slowdown in the economy. During the quarter ended June, companies had indicated the slowdown is transitional and that they expect to recover by the festive season.
The Indian innerwear market, worth $6.3 billion, is estimated to account for 9% of the total domestic fashion retail segment but is highly fragmented and unorganised.
Once known as merely an essential wear, the segment saw work-from-home and hybrid work culture along with increasing awareness about health, fitness, and personal hygiene amid the pandemic driving growth.
Buoyed by demand from millennial customers, a host of digital-first brands including XYXX, Damensch, Almo, Bummer and Freecultr have entered the market and disrupted it by either selling lower-priced products or slashing price-tags to gain market share.
Brands attribute the slowdown in demand to a high base, especially for athleisure wear, which saw a demand surge during work from home trend amid pandemic-led restrictions.

“There’s a clear demand for a more comprehensive range of NBA merchandise in the country, which is reflected by the fact that sales of NBA-branded Suditi products have grown four times since the launch of our collaboration. We expect that trend to continue as part of this multiyear expansion and look forward to continuing to work with Suditi to produce fanwear that empowers fans in India to represent their favorite teams and players in style.”
“The NBA is one of the best brands globally, and we are excited to build on our valued merchandising relationship with them,” said Harsh Agarwal, Co-Founder, Suditi Sports Apparel.

Apparel companies upbeat on demand revival,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-companies-upbeat-on-demand-revival/articleshow/105270848.cms,17-11-2023,"Apparel brands, manufacturers and retailers said the outlook for fresh buying of stock and inventory has improved after 3-4 quarters of subdued purchases, led by an improvement in demand during festive sales and retailers being able to clear out most of their old unsold stock.
One of the largest apparel manufacturers
Arvind
's chief strategy officer Samir Agarwal told analysts a fortnight back that the inventory correction cycle, which was playing out for the last 2-3 quarters, has tapered off and its customers have begun fresh buying discussions. ""Although they are going to buy in small lots and closer to the actual demand, those discussions have resumed,"" he said.
Agarwal said the first half of the fiscal in the domestic market was ""quite muted"" in terms of the consumer demand because of the overbought situation from the last year. ""As we opened this quarter in the initial few days of October, there seems to be some resumption in consumer demand and buying and like-to-like growth. Specifically, for premium and mass premium segments in the market, things are looking up,"" he said.
Apparel manufacturer
Gokaldas Exports
, which mostly exports, expects the supply momentum to pick up in the second half of the fiscal, particularly with the third quarter production for spring 2024 as brands have more or less destocked their inventory and are increasing their order placements, said managing director Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi.
Ganapathi told analysts that the company expects ""sequential growth to trend up in the next two quarters"" with a good order book. He said apparel imports by the US for the year to date fell 23% while by the EU fell by 13%, and major brands were consciously liquidating excess inventory holdings and controlling their purchases.
Live Events
""When I talk to operators in Bangladesh, Vietnam, China, they have all seen a much higher degree of slowdown. So, in such a situation, it's hard for anybody to outperform. The fact that India has dropped only 12% is a good sign I would say,"" said Ganapathi.
Even Indian apparel retailers and brands have controlled their purchases in the last 3-4 quarters with inventory piling up after the initial wave of high demand due to wardrobe refresh post Covid waned off after the 2022 festive season. Retailers and brands had to liquidate inventory with higher discounts.
V-Mart Retail
, for instance, said its total inventory reduced by ₹74 crore year-on-year in the September quarter despite the festive push and 15% more number of stores, which has helped it to improve the working capital cycle. The small town-focused retailer has already liquidated 70% of its older high priced inventory and the balance 30%, which is winter products, will be liquidated in the next two quarters.
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
management told analysts last week that the company could not ""anticipate the slowing of demand fast enough and therefore there was an inventory build-up"", which has been liquidated in the end of season sales.

Fan in blue: Team India jersey scores big on sales,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/fan-in-blue-team-india-jersey-scores-big-on-sales/articleshow/104452316.cms,16-10-2023,"New Delhi: Quick commerce platform Blinkit's chief executive
Albinder Dhindsa
was among those taken by surprise on the huge fan frenzy over the India
blue jersey
.
""We started selling the official
India
fan jersey on Blinkit when the season started. I thought the jersey sales on Ind vs Aus on Sunday were pretty good. I was so wrong. Nothing comes close to IndVsPak,"" Dhindsa said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday evening, as the two subcontinent rivals faced off against each other in the world's largest cricket stadium.
Dhindsa was comparing sales of the blue jerseys on October 8 when India played Australia, and October 14 when India played Pakistan.
As the city of Ahmedabad and the Narendra Modi stadium turned into a sea of blue on Super Saturday with India and Pakistan clashing and more than 100,000 spectators wearing blue jerseys, sales of the India jersey reached a record high with estimates of nearly ₹150 crore, according to industry executives.
The amount includes both the sales of official Adidas jerseys and the cheaper generic ones. They said the numbers are double that of jersey sales during the IPL T20, the other global cash-rich cricket tournament that India hosts every summer.

Ecommerce giant Amazon has placed the official Adidas India blue jersey as a ""bestseller"" on its platform, and a spokesperson said demand for sports jerseys has surged on Amazon Fashion. ""We saw a 4.8X increase in the last four weeks, which escalated to an astounding 9X growth in the last three weeks before the match kicked-off on 5th October. The official Adidas ODI fan jersey emerged as a game-changer, accounting for 50% of the total units sold on October 13 and 14,"" the Amazon India spokesperson said.
Myntra and Meesho too are selling a wide range of India blue jerseys and T-shirts with names of top cricketers like
Virat Kohli
and MS
Dhoni
, and customisation options, leading to a big spike in sales.
Sachin Takkar, vice president, category at Myntra, said there has been a notable spike in demand for the cricket jerseys. ""The demand has grown close to 5X of business-as-usual days since India's most recent victory, as the fans are leaving no stone unturned to flaunt their support for the Men in Blue,"" Takkar said.
Dream Sports-backed FanCode Shop, the exclusive licensing and merchandising partner of the ICC, is selling a variety of blue jerseys with offers such as ""super fan deals"" to personalise the jerseys with customer names without extra charges.
""Apart from people in stadiums, people were wearing the India blue jersey even while watching India matches at bars, theatres or even house parties with family and friends. Yesterday's win will trigger more sales if India continues its winning streak,"" Gaurav Marya, chairman of licensing and franchising consultancy Franchise India, said.
Adidas, the official jersey sponsor of
Team India
, is selling the India jerseys across channels, and these are available even in general trade, according to executives. An email seeking comment from Adidas did not elicit a response.
Gautam Dutta, co-chief executive at PVR-INOX, which is live screening the matches, said: ""Much like the stadium, there is tremendous fanfare visible at the cinemas. Fans came in the India blue jerseys to add to the vibe."" The multiplex chain is screening all India league matches and three knock-out matches across 116 cinemas in over 40 cities, which it said is closest to being at the stadium.
The brisk sales, retail trade executives said, are expected to surge further as India progresses, irrespective of whether they are Adidas originals or duplicate prints. ""A lot of fans came dressed in the India blue jerseys and caps. For those who couldn't, there were dozens of vendors selling the jerseys outside the stadium, with fans having come from across the country,"" a retail trade executive said.
From the who's who of India Inc to spectators in stands, almost everyone was seen wearing the blue jersey. Bars and restaurants too are also linking the India blue to consumer offers. The Beer Cafe is offering discounts to visitors wearing the India blue jersey.

How Levi's CEO washes his jeans? Hint: In the showers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/how-levis-ceo-washes-his-jeans-hint-in-the-showers/articleshow/104369499.cms,12-10-2023,"The debate over how often should you wash your
jeans
still rages on. Some denim lovers say never wash them because washing jeans will impact their shape and color. Those who want to wash jeans, here is how
Levi Strauss CEO
Charles Bergh does it. He however does not use a washing machine.
""True denim heads, people that really love their denim, will tell you to never put your denim into a washing machine. So that’s what I do,” he told CNBC recently.
Then how does Levi's CEO wash his denims? “If I drop some curry on my jeans, I’m gonna clean it. But I’ll spot clean it. And if they get really gross you know, if I’ve been out sweating or something and they get really gross, I’ll wash them in the shower. This means keeping jeans on in the shower and covering them in soap as you would your body, Bergh explained.
Chip Bergh
has been CEO of the iconic brand since 2011. He is also on the company’s board of directors and is credited to have led a remarkable turnaround in the fortunes of the company. It returned to the public markets with a successful IPO in March 2019.
Levi Strauss is one of the world's largest brand-name apparel companies and a global leader in jeanswear. Its products are sold in more than 110 countries worldwide. The company had reported net revenues of $6.2 billion in 2022.

Michelle Gass
said India is now the largest market for the San Francisco-based
jeans
maker within Asia and sixth largest globally.
Levi’s, which opened its first door in the country three decades ago, expects significant growth in the fastest-growing major economy in the world in 2023 which is also one of the most exciting consumer markets with more than half the population under the age of 30, she said.
“The Levi's brand has increased nearly 50% in this important market compared to pre-pandemic revenue levels, becoming our sixth largest country and now the largest in Asia,” Gass said during the firm’s earnings call.
A former Starbucks and Kohl's executive, Gass joined Levi's this year and will take over from long-time CEO Chip Bergh in 2024.
Levi’s, popular for its 501 jeans and the leather patch showing two horses trying to pull apart a pair of pants, said India not only highlights its successful regional expansion playbook but also demonstrates its ability to deliver a true denim lifestyle offering.

“India is primarily a franchise market and the strong growth is largely a reflection of the conviction of our partners in the power of our brands,” Gass said. “For example, during the pandemic, our franchisees doubled the Levi’s brand square footage in key malls across India to take advantage of the long-term opportunity they see. In India, the team has done a great job curating a diverse product assortment across tops and bottoms, driven both by our global design engine as well as our local product capability.”
Over the past decade, Levi’s has consolidated its franchisees in the country down to two dozen from over 80. It has also opened a few company-owned-and-operated shops that are significantly larger than the average 2,000 square foot store size.
Levi’s sells three bottoms for every top in key markets worldwide. India is an exception where people buy one bottom for every top on average. The company is trying to push more non-denim clothing and women’s apparel as it seeks to broaden its share of the consumer’s wardrobe.
The company posted a 58% year-on-year increase in net sales in India to Rs 1,154 crore in FY22, as per the latest available filing. However, unlike rivals that report retail sales, Levi’s revenues are not comparable because sales are accounted at wholesale prices to franchise partners.
In addition, India is increasingly becoming a talent hub for Levi's globally. For instance, more than a year ago, the fashion retailer named Sanjeev Mohanty, managing director of South Asia-Middle East and Africa for Levi Strauss & Co, based out of India, as its managing director for the US and Canada. Harmit Singh, global chief financial and growth officer was also elevated and given additional roles in corporate strategy and global retail real estate.

"Weak Rupee may perk up slowing garment, handicraft exports",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/weak-rupee-may-perk-up-slowing-garment-handicraft-exports/articleshow/104195661.cms,06-10-2023,"India's slowing exports could get a fillip with the rupee weakening against the dollar. Exporters of
labour-intensive products
such as ready-made garments, carpets, leather and handicrafts expect a 2-10% rise in outbound shipments aided by the depreciating rupee.
However, they said sectors with a low dependence on imports would gain while others will lose their benefits to higher oil and commodity prices.
""
Rupee depreciation
needs to be seen in comparison with our competing currencies. Any depreciation of the rupee will benefit labour-intensive exports except gems and jewellery because they have a huge import component,"" said Ajay Sahai, director general,
Federation of Indian Export Organisations
(FIEO).
The rupee is expected to remain under pressure amid rising crude oil prices stemming from
OPEC
production cuts.
Besides rising oil prices, elevated interest rates and inflation globally could lead to outflow of capital, putting pressure on the rupee.

Rupee depreciation would benefit exports because majority of the costs are incurred in rupee except where raw material imports are involved. However, a weaker rupee would make imports more expensive.
The carpet industry has seen a 40% decline in orders since the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The import component in carpets, such as wool, dyes and latex, is 9-10%.
""The industry has begun making carpets of lower value to cater to slowing demand and also online sales have been picking up,"" said Sidh Nath Singh, director of Mirzapur-based Carpet Handicrafts Export. While carpets used to cost ₹1,500-9,000 per meter till a few years ago, the average has now reduced to ₹800-900 per meter.
Nishith Gupta, managing director, Sapana Carpet-Mats, said rupee depreciation bumps up exports in the very short term, about three months, and that increase is in line with the depreciation.
""Customers ask us to use recycled polymer, which is 10-15% cheaper than virgin polymer, flexible packaging to reduce freight costs and lighter specifications to keep the selling price constant,"" Gupta added.
A weaker currency makes US dollar-denominated imports such as raw materials including sulphur, ammonia and potash more expensive. In the pharma sector, large firms that are net exporters tend to benefit from currency depreciation but small and mid-sized companies that rely on imported bulk drugs from China might get impacted adversely.
Industry estimates that a 1% fall in the rupee's value increases garment exporters' profits by 0.25-0.5%, and it may make
garment exports
more competitive in the medium term as raw material cost falls and the benefits are passed on to customers.
""A weak rupee is only a temporary relief and not a long-term benefit because raw material prices have risen. However, we expect a 4-5% rupee depreciation to translate into a 10% growth in exports if the raw material prices don't increase further,"" said a representative of the engineering goods industry.

India aims to clock $350 billion in apparel and textiles market size including $100 billion exports by 2030. The aggressive pace and scope of the recent free trade agreements which are either signed up such as India-UAE CEPA, and India-Australia ECTA, or are under negotiations with the EU, UK, and Canada are indicators of this, he said.
Over the last one year, the textile and apparel industry across the globe has faced challenges due to stagnation in production and trade stemming from high volatility in raw material prices, uncertainties emerging due to geopolitical conflicts like the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, reorientation of supply chains and high inflationary pressures in countries like the US and EU, which are major markets for Indian exporters. Exports of textiles and apparel from India declined by about 18% to reach $35.7 billion during FY23 as compared to FY22.

"Domestic demand, exports revival to boost readymade garment players' revenue by 8-10 pc in FY24: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/domestic-demand-exports-revival-to-boost-readymade-garment-players-revenue-by-8-10-pc-in-fy24-report/articleshow/104047691.cms,29-09-2023,"Readymade
garment manufacturers are likely to post an 8-10 per cent increase in revenue on the back of growing domestic demand and revival of exports, a report said on Friday. Domestic demand and revival in exports have been driven by lower
cotton prices
and easing supply-chain disruptions, the report by
Crisil Ratings
said.
Volume growth will be higher at 6-8 per cent this fiscal, compared with 3-5 per cent last fiscal, it said.
Despite this, revenue will grow slower than the 14 per cent in the last fiscal as realisations moderate due to easing raw material prices.
The Crisil Ratings report further said prices of cotton and man-made fibre are expected to fall 15-17 per cent and 8-10 per cent, respectively, this fiscal.
Consequently, growth in realisations will be a meagre 1-3 per cent this fiscal, as against 10 per cent last year, the rating agency said.

""Readymade garment manufacturer makers will rely on domestic consumption (75 per cent of the overall demand), which is expected to grow 6-8 per cent in volume terms this fiscal.
""The volume of exports (25 per cent) will grow 4-6 per cent this fiscal year-on-year on a low base, led by re-stocking by global retailers, softer prices of cotton (the key raw material) and a slow but gradual pick-up in consumption in overseas markets,"" Crisil Ratings Director
Gautam Shahi
said.
Meanwhile, the report said the credit outlook for readymade garment manufacturers remains stable, driven by steady operating performance and healthier balance sheets amid low capital expenditure and stable
working capital
requirement.
The report further said volume of exports fell 7 per cent year-on-year last fiscal following a sharp rise in domestic cotton prices and moderation in demand from the US and the
European Union
, which account for 60 per cent of shipments.
This fiscal, higher domestic and export volume and lower cotton prices will help expand operating margins by 50 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 9.5 per cent.
In contrast, operating margin had shrunk 150 bps last fiscal due to elevated cotton prices, delayed price hikes in the domestic market, and lower offtake by global retailers amid inventory pile-up, the report added.

Goods and Services Tax
revenue and USD 44 billion foreign exchange earnings, officials of Southern India Mills'

The industries have been facing challenges in the recent past mainly due to structural issues on the raw material front, high cost of production, scale of operation among others,

The Association would strive to address structural issues and enhance global competitiveness, he said.
According to association officials, the NDA government has been giving major thrust for enhancing the global competitiveness of the textiles and clothing industry and addressed several issues.
""However, the policy pitfalls in certain areas and delay in strengthening the raw material base, refunding government dues have been affecting the industry to achieve a sustained growth rate,"" he said in a press release.

Though several States provide attractive incentives, there is an undue delay in disbursing the committed benefits on time resulting in several financial stress for the new investments made, SIMA said.
""Under this scenario, it has become essential to have a holistic approach with long term vision not only to grab the space vacated by
China
in the textile trade but also to achieve a sustained growth rate,"" he said.
Sundararaman urged the Union Minister of
Textiles Piyush Goyal
to exempt
VSF

He expressed hope the free trade agreement with the United Kingdom and the

for foodgrains from various states, a senior official said on Tuesday. The
Indian Jute Mills Association
(IJMA) has appealed to the Centre for a revision in the sixth (revised) supply plan issued by the Food & Public Distribution department.
Foodgrain producers have to use jute as a packaging material to a certain extent.
""In the current jute season from September to November 2023, the actual demand indent placement is lower by 30-40 per cent. In September alone, demand indents are expected to be lower than 2.5 lakh bales against planned 3.21 lakh bales due to slow order placing by
Maharashtra
,"" IJMA Chairman Raghav Gupta told PTI.
For the months of October and November, the indents are likely to be about 1.48 lakh bales against over 2 lakh bales as per the August plans, he stated.
""But, in terms of capacity utilisation, our production cut will be to the tune of 30-50 per cent, unless indents are not revised upwards"" Gupta said.

Furthermore, the sudden cancellation of indents by the
Chhattisgarh
government for October and November has dealt a severe blow to the industry, IJMA claimed in its presentation to the government.
As a consequence of the underutilised capacity in jute mills, manufacturers have initiated production cutbacks, a move that could significantly impact the pricing of raw jute, which is currently hovering below Minimum Support Price (
MSP
) levels, former IJMA chairman Sanjay Kajaria said.
The instability in raw jute prices poses a threat to farmers, who may not receive adequate compensation for their produce, especially during the upcoming new jute crop harvest, he said.
In light of these challenges, the IJMA has sought restoration of the cancelled indents by the Chhattisgarh government.
The association has also urged the advancement of orders for 2 lakh bales for the upcoming RMS 2024-25 season to November 2023.
These measures are seen as critical to ensuring the uninterrupted operation of
jute mills
across West Bengal during the festive season of Durga Puja.
About 2.5 lakh workers are engaged in mills that produce about Rs 7000 crore worth of jute products and the lion's share goes into food grain packaging.

Sumeet Industries' lenders ask initial bidder to raise offer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/sumeet-industries-lenders-ask-initial-bidder-to-raise-offer/articleshow/103332357.cms,04-09-2023,"Lenders
to the debt laden textile company
Sumeet Industries
are in negotiations with the Gujarat-based
Gajera
Group to improve its
offer
after its inital bid to take over the company was bettered by
Geelon Industries
, three people familiar with the matter said.
Banks
are seeking more than Rs 250 crore for the company in an all-cash deal, higher than the Rs 221 crore offered by Geelon, these people said.
Sumeet has been classified as a non performing account (NPA) with banks for more than three years. It owes lenders led by
Bank of Baroda
(BoB) more than Rs 900 crore including about Rs 530 crore in principal. Lenders expect to recover atleast 47% of their principal dues by asking Gajera to better its offer.
""Lenders see a good chance of improving the
offer on the table
now. Both Geelon and Gajera are interested. But Gajera by virtue of being highest bidder in the auction gets the first shot at improving his offer,"" said a person aware of the process.
Helmed by diamond trader Chunibhai Gajera, the group has interests in real estate and education besides diamonds. It had offered just below Rs 200 crore in the initial bids in July. Subsequently, lenders have started negotiations with individual bidders resulting in Silvassa based Geelon Industries improving its offer to Rs 221 crore which comes to about a 42% recovery for lenders.

Sumeet was admitted for bankruptcy proceedings in December last year, after a failed attempt to restructure its loans.
BoB is the largest creditor to the company with a 65% share of the company’s dues to financial creditors, followed by
IDBI Bank
(21%). Other lenders are
Central Bank of India
,
Canara Bank
,
Union Bank of India
and Germany-based Oldenburgische Landesbank AG.
Resolution professional Satyendra Khorania could not be immediately reached for comment.
Bids for the company have been weaker than lenders' expectations due to high input costs and weak demand in the industry. Large bidders like Reliance Industires and Kolkata based MCPI chose not to bid after initially expressing interest, ET reported in June.
""The bids on the table are all cash though it is likely that Gajera will seek up to six months to make the final payment. The one on one negotiations with bidders has been going on since the last two months. Lenders are confident of closing this deal in the next week or so and applying for NCLT for clearance,"" said a second person aware of the transaction.
If banks are successful in hiking the offers from prospective buyers they will do better than the Rs 225 crore offered by the promoter in a one-time settlement with banks more than two years ago.
Sumeet Industries
had tried to restructure its loans and even received the mandatory RP4 credit rating, based on which a restructuring plan was proposed. However, banks could not agree on the details of the plan.
The 47% recovery on principal will also be better than the 43% recovery managed by State Bank of India (SBI) and Tourism Finance Corp of India (TFCI) through a one time settlement closed in fiscal ended March 2022.
Founded in 1988, Sumeet specialises polyester texturised yarn, fully drawn yarn, and partially oriented yarn among others.
The company's purified terephthalic acid (PTA) capacity is an attractive proposition for companies. PTA is used to make polyester value chain products used in consumer goods, textile and packaging.
Latest results show that the company's losses tripled to Rs 16 crore in the quarter ended June 2023 from Rs 5 crore a year ago as revenues fell and expenditure remained elevated.

The Mumbai-based company has admitted liabilities of Rs 7,234 crore, including Rs 6,690 crore in financial dues.
In March, more than a dozen companies including Lalbhai Group-promoted Arvind Ltd, as well as entities of the Donear Group,
Welspun Group
entity and
JM Financial

On Thursday, the company’s resolution professional (RP), Satish Kumar Gupta, informed stock exchanges that its committee of creditors (CoC) has decided to reject all resolution plans received for various assets of the company.
JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company and JM Financial Properties had submitted expressions of interest for all categories of its assets. While JM Financial ARC holds 91% of the admitted financial claims, the remaining 9% is by Axis Bank.

The other applicants that submitted expressions of interest included Rashmi Metaliks, Khandwala Finstocks, Linen Arts and Dev Land & Housing.
“It is well within the CoC's exercise of commercial wisdom to reject all the resolution plans if it doesn’t find them to be viable. The extended CIRP period for Bombay Rayons Fashion Ltd is set to expire next week and the next step would be for the RP to file an application for liquidation,” said Aparna
Ravi
, Partner at
Samvad Partners
. “However, given the number of resolution plans received and that the IBC tends to favour resolution over liquidation in the best interests of all stakeholders, the NCLT is likely to question the RP on the reasons that none of the resolution plans were acceptable.”
“This case is also different from the typical situation as separate resolution plans were sought for different categories of assets of Bombay Rayons Fashion and resolution applicants were free to submit plans for all or some of the categories. Even if a liquidation order is passed, these assets could be sold on a going concern basis in liquidation,” she said.
“Once a proposed resolution plan is rejected by the CoC in its commercial wisdom, the same is placed before the Adjudicating Authority (AA),” said Yogendra Aldak, partner at Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys. “It has been the consistent view of the courts that AA is not vested with the power to modify the resolution plan or to re-evaluate the same. Upon rejection of the resolution plan, AA has no option, but to initiate the liquidation process as per Section 33(1) of the IBC.”
Historically, the company has been a supplier to brands such as Orient Craft, Black Mango Fashions, Reliance Trends, GAP, Abercrombie & Fitch, Guess, Primark, H&M and Wal-Mart among others.
Last June ,the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the company for corporate insolvency at the behest of a plea filed by Vikash Parasprampuria of Chiranjilal Yarn Traders.
Subsequently, Prashant Agrawal, a suspended board member of the company, appealed the ruling at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The appellate tribunal upheld the tribunal’s order on July 15, 2022.
Janardhan Agrawal-promoted Bombay Rayon has textile-making units in Maharashtra, Bengaluru, Kerala and Indore.
The company reported Rs 83 crore in revenue and a loss of Rs 1,147 crore for FY2022, as per its disclosure at stock exchanges.

Govt extends textile PLI application date till Oct 31,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/govt-extends-textile-pli-application-date-till-oct-31/articleshow/103255862.cms,31-08-2023,"The government on Thursday extended by two months till October 31, the date of inviting fresh applications under the performance-linked incentive (PLI) scheme of textiles for
manmade fibre apparel

fabrics
and products of
technical textiles
.
The textile ministry had in July reopened the PLI scheme portal till August 31 “in view of the requests from the industry stakeholders”.

The textiles ministry had approved 64 applications under the Rs 19,798 crore scheme last year. In part-1 of the PLI schemes, the minimum investment required is Rs 300 crore and the minimum turnover required to be achieved for incentive is Rs 600 crore while in part-2, the minimum investment should be Rs 100 crore and the minimum turnover is Rs 200 crore.

Home textile industry to see 7-9% rise in revenues this fiscal: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/home-textile-industry-to-see-7-9-rise-in-revenues-this-fiscal-report/articleshow/103218491.cms,30-08-2023,"Home textile industry
's revenues are expected to rise 7-9 per cent this fiscal as the
sector regains
global share following a correction in domestic
cotton prices
and restocking by
big-box retailers
in major overseas markets, says a report. In the last financial year, their revenues had declined 15 per cent.
According to the
Crisil Ratings
report released on Wednesday, operating profitability of the industry will improve 150-200 basis points to 14-14.5 per cent this fiscal, due to lower raw material cost and better operating leverage, but will still hover below the pre-pandemic levels.
Improved operating performance will also have the industry maintaining a stable credit outlook despite moderate capex, it noted.
The report is based on an analysis of 40 companies, accounting for 40-45 per cent of the sectoral revenues.
As much as 70-75 per cent of the industry-wide revenues are from exports, with the US, its biggest market, accounting for more than half of it.
Live Events
After strong headwinds in exports last fiscal, the domestic home textile industry is on the road to recovery on the back of domestic cotton prices, which had risen past international prices and reached Rs 1 lakh per candy in May 2022.
The same has reduced to Rs 55,000 per candy, helping the industry regain competitiveness.
Moreover, orders from big-box retailers in the US will increase this fiscal as the inventory, piled up in the last financial year, depletes on easing global supply chain challenges, and the gradual sales recovery being seen over the past few months, the report said.
Mohit Makhija, a senior director at the rating agency, said that with domestic raw material prices gaining competitiveness now, restocking by big-box US retailers, and sustained China plus one policy of global buyers, revenue will rebound for export-oriented domestic home textile makers this fiscal.
This is reflected in the recent increase in the country's share in home textile imports by the US to 47 per cent in the first half of 2023 after falling to 44 per cent in 2022 from 48 per cent in 2021.
However, capacity utilisation will improve only slowly due to the recent large capacity addition amid moderate demand growth, which will have operating margins still printing in below the pre-pandemic levels, the report said.

India likely to present incentives for ailing textile industry by December: Trade body,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/india-likely-to-present-incentives-for-ailing-textile-by-december-trade-body/articleshow/102987121.cms,23-08-2023,"India's government is likely to announce fiscal incentives for the ailing textile and
apparel industry
by the end of this year, partly to stave of the impact of a fall in overseas orders, a trade body said on Wednesday.

Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
The incentives could come under the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme that promises billions of dollars to boost manufacturing ranging from
electronic products
to pharmaceuticals.
""The government could make an announcement by December,"" said T. Rajkumar, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI), referring to industry representatives' meetings with textile and
finance ministry
officials earlier this month.
Earlier this month, government officials reviewed the
PLI scheme
, launched in 2020, under which government proposed to offer around $24 billion in
cash incentives
to 14 sectors.
The $150 billion textile and apparel industry, which employs over 45 million, is facing declining exports as European and U.S. consumers cut back on spending amid an
inflationary squeeze

India's textile and apparel exports fell nearly 14% to $11.25 billion in April-July, the first four months of the current fiscal year to March 31, 2024.
In a submission to the government, the industry has asked for fiscal incentives for smaller manufacturers under the PLI scheme and urged the government to withdraw 11% import duty on certain varieties of cotton, imported from Egypt and the United States, to meet specific orders, Rajkumar said.
Rakesh Mehra, president of Indian Spinners Association, said the industry needed government support and signing of proposed free trade agreements with the EU and Britain to boost exports.
Nearly one-third of spinning units have cut production leading to fears of job losses, Mehra said.
""In the election year, the government will surely support the sector that offers jobs to millions to workers,"" he said.

Pakistan’s textile industry struggles due to low exports and inflation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/pakistans-textile-industry-struggling-with-headwinds/articleshow/102928347.cms,22-08-2023,"Pakistan’s
textile sector
which has conventionally served as the bedrock for most of its industrial labour is staring at a gloomy future. Once a thriving sector of
Pakistan
's economy, the industry now struggles with low exports amid a deepening crisis.
The past two years have seen the country’s finances struggling including forex reserves, inflation, debt to GDP ratio, fiscal and current account deficit. This had an adverse impact on various industrial activities including production, employment and trade, according to experts on Pakistan's economy.
Being the most important mainstay of Pakistan's industrial spectrum, the
textile industry
is facing unprecedented stress. Many of the country’s textile mills and manufacturing units catering to consumers in Europe and the US are now shut down or facing closure due to lack of orders or input shortages.
Already battered by economic slowdown, Covid and disruptions in the global supply chain, the textile industry could not sustain the impact of devastating floods of 2022 which resulted in destruction of a large portion of the cotton crop. As cotton production reached historic low, the simultaneous political crisis played its part in aggravating the situation.
The government's ad hoc measures like import freeze, aimed at managing foreign reserves, further hindered the industry’s ability to manage the shortfall by sourcing inputs from outside. On top of that, the industry underwent a tax hike recently. The textile companies also complain of a substantial increase in the cost of capital, with interest rates exceeding 20 per cent in the country. These factors added further strain to the already struggling textile sector in Pakistan, resulting in massive job losses and fall in export volume, according to reports in Pakistani media.

Cotton textile, apparel companies see 8-10% rise in exports
“Pakistan’s economy has been mismanaged over the years. This is reflected in the textile sector which was a promising sector. The political disturbances will further dent growth in the sector,” according to Pradeep Mehta, Secretary General, CUTS International (a leading public policy body) and a leading expert on international trade.
From $19.3 billion recorded in 2021-22, the level of textile exports from Pakistan fell by 15 percent to reach $16.5 billion in 2022-2023. Traditionally, the industry is dependent on the support of export markets across the EU, UK, US, UAE and Turkey. Textiles account for around 60% of Pakistan's exports and its crisis is expected to spread to other parts of the economy. Moreover, an extended period of subdued performance in exports is likely to provide a window of opportunity to regional competitors like India and Bangladesh.
The CEO of renowned
Kohinoor Mills
Aamir Fayyaz Sheikh was recently quoted in Pak media as saying that ""Pakistan's overall market share in the textile and garment industry was nearly 2.25 percent about two years ago. Now it's down to around 1.7 percent."" More than the reduction in export volume, the decline of the textile industry has ramifications beyond economy. The crisis may also turn into a social problem involving the poor labourers who could be displaced from the textile sector.
According to Pakistani media, the sector employs over 40 per cent of the country’s 20 million industrial workforce. According to some estimates, 25 to 30 per cent of the textile factories in the country have faced closure while many others are operating well below full capacity. This has led to an estimated job loss of around 700,000 across the country since last year.

Analysts also fear the contagion effects of industrial slowdown and job losses on other sectors of the economy. As per local media, the job losses are also being observed in another important industrial employer -- the Automotive sector. The
Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts
and Accessories Manufacturers claims that around 25,000-30,000 workers in the country’s automotive sector have lost their jobs due to a drop in annual sales.
The policymakers in Pakistan need to look deep into the problems faced by the textile sector. However, any such proposal is unlikely to find favour with the Pakistan government which has traditionally preferred the easier task of securing concessional exports deals from developed countries (like GSP plus from EU) using its low development status as an effective instrument.

"Indian hosiery sector stitches up revenue growth of Rs 36,000 cr, 18-20% higher on-year",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/indian-hosiery-sector-stitches-up-revenue-growth-of-rs-36000-cr-18-20-higher-on-year/articleshow/102896251.cms,21-08-2023,"The
Indian hosiery
industry will stitch up revenue of Rs 36,000 crore this fiscal, 18-20% higher on-year, riding on a revival in
rural demand
. Operating margin will expand 300-400 basis points (bps) on softer input prices and improved capacity utilisations. A CRISIL Ratings analysis of 28 hosiery makers, accounting for a third of the industry by revenue, indicates as much.
Rural demand, which accounts for almost half the domestic revenue, was impacted last fiscal amid rising inflation and lower farmer income. As a result, the overall volume plunged 30% on-year.
Says
Rahul Guha
, Director, CRISIL Ratings, “This fiscal, urban demand is expected to remain stable, while a well-distributed monsoon and probable inflation moderation should boost rural demand, leading to a recovery of 35-40% in volume. Potential export opportunities, especially to Gulf countries, could bump up volume further.”
Notably, the
Comprehensive Economic Partnership
Agreement signed by the government with
UAE
could boost textile segment exports, especially of hosiery. Tailwinds from the agreement could add 2-3% to hosiery exports from the historical level of 10%. That said,
revenue growth
would be higher than the 18-20% expected, were it not for a 15-17% fall in realisations that saw a significant uptrend in the past two fiscals.
On the input side, the price of cotton yarn, the key raw material, nearly doubled in the last two fiscals. Hosiery makers had to absorb a sizeable portion of the price rise amid muted demand as well as spend more on marketing and advertising to push sales. As a result, operating margin shrank 250 bps last fiscal. While yarn prices have crashed since the second half of fiscal 2023, the entire benefit has not been passed on to the consumers. This can be seen in the widening spread between realisation and cost.

Further, amid strong demand pull, hosiery manufacturers will curtail their spends on advertising and marketing expenses. Increased operating leverage from higher capacity utilisations, too, will aid profitability. Hence, operating margin will improve to the pre-pandemic level of 12-14%.
Says
Himank Sharma
, Director, CRISIL Ratings, “Capacity utilisation, which had fallen to 60% last fiscal, will rebound to ~90% this fiscal. We don’t see companies taking up significant capacity expansion this fiscal, so addition of long-term debt will be minimal. Strong cash flows from higher revenue and profitability will be sufficient to meet incremental working capital requirement and keep overall debt in check.”
Total outside liabilities to tangible net worth and interest coverage ratios will improve to 1.0 and 6.5 times, respectively, better than the pre-pandemic levels. This will alleviate pressure on the credit risk profiles seen last fiscal amid declining revenue and profitability. However, erratic rainfall or inflation could dampen rural sentiment and remain key downside risks while higher exports may support the growth and margins further. 1 Hosiery includes stocking, socks, undergarments, and knitted t-shirt.

The problem is that ""India's export of apparel has largely been US- and EU-centric"", said Mithileshwar Thakur, secretary general of
Apparel Export Promotion Council
.
The US, the EU and the UK account for approximately 50% of India's textiles and
apparel exports
.
""Orders have not dried up, but generally the request is to defer it by a few months,"" Thakur said, adding that clients have been asking for price cuts too.
The first three months of this fiscal saw apparel exports decline by around 23%, 13% and 17% in April, May and June respectively, according to official estimates. The quarter as a whole saw a 17.7% year-over-year dip to $3.69 billion in 2023 from shipments worth $4.49 billion in 2022.
Exports of apparels and garments to practically all destinations have declined, Thakur said; in June 2023, the US-bound shipments declined 23.8% compared to that in June 2022, while the UK and Germany saw declines of 14.2% and 23.7% respectively, he said.
Yet, these remain India's top apparel export markets, with US-bound exports for June 2023 to the tune of $412 million, Thakur noted.
Thakur emphasised the need not only to diversify India's export markets, but also rejig the composition of the export basket. Global demand for man-made fibre (MMF) apparel is on the rise, but their share in India's offering, which is skewed towards cotton, is little.

India’s jute industry revenue may fall 5-6% this fiscal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/indias-jute-industry-revenue-may-fall-5-6-this-fiscal/articleshow/102763917.cms,16-08-2023,"India’s
jute
industry is set to see revenue fall 5-6% this fiscal because of lower
exports
, marking the second consecutive year of decline, according to
CRISIL Ratings
. However, domestic demand is expected to be stable.
Operating margin is seen down 200-250 basis points to 5% as exports, which are more profitable, would be lower.Credit profiles are seen stable on healthy balance sheets, and negligible capital expenditure (capex).
An analysis of jute companies rated by
CRISIL
Ratings, accounting for 30% of the sector’s revenue, indicates as much.Exports, which form a third of the sector’s revenue of Rs 12,000 crore, are seen 15% lower this fiscal, after falling 8% last fiscal as overseas channel partners continue to destock amid slowdown worries in the US and Europe (key markets accounting for over 60% of the total exports from India).
The end-use of jute in these markets is largely discretionary.In contrast, domestic demand is expected to be stable because of steady orders for storage and transportation bags (made of jute) owing to higher grain procurement by the government.
The domestic market, which accounts for the balance two-third of the sector’s revenue, depends on government demand as it procures almost 80% of the jute produced through its nodal agencies. To add, mandatory norms under the Jute Packaging Materials Act 1987, provides 100% reservation for packaging of food grains and 20% reservation for packaging of sugar in jute bags.This lends stability to demand for jute bags domestically and this trend is unlikely to change over the medium term. But the revenue comes at lower operating margin compared with exports.
Live Events
Says Nitin Kansal, Director, CRISIL Ratings, “Weak export demand will reduce capacity utilisation of specialised looms and weigh on sales of specialised jute products such as hessian, gift articles and decorative fabrics. Hence, companies may defer capacity addition and only undertake minor maintenance capex. At the same time, companies may woo overseas customers through longer credit period, which may lengthen working capital cycles from 100 days to 140 days, on average, leading to higher
reliance
on working capital debt.”But healthy balance sheets will ensure comfortable debt metrics, lending stability to credit profiles. Jute companies had used cash accruals from strong operating performance in fiscal 2022 to deleverage their balance sheets.
Adds Argha Chanda, Associate Director, CRISIL Ratings, “Despite lower cash accruals and a likely increase in working capital borrowings, healthy balance sheets should keep debt metrics comfortable. Moreover, the capex outlay will be minimal and will be funded through cash accrual. Hence, credit profiles of jute companies will remain stable.”
CRISIL Ratings expects leverage and interest coverage for its portfolio at 0.55 and 3.7 times, respectively, this fiscal, compared with an average of 0.45 time and 8 times, respectively, in past three fiscals.Global recessionary pressures and any dilution in
jute packaging reservation
norms will remain key monitorable for the jute industry.

Consumers started reducing non-essential spending such as that on apparel, lifestyle products and electronics and dining out since Diwali last year due to inflation, increase in interest rates, job losses in some sectors such as startups and IT, and an overall slowdown in the economy.
Conceived by former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in the late 1970s, the men's underwear index reflects the state of a nation's economy based on underwear sales. Companies, however, said the slowdown is transitional and expect to recover by the festive season.
Aditya Birla Fashion
& Retail said after more than two years of strong demand, the athleisure part of the innerwear business has been slowing down in the last two or three quarters after the work-from-home trend declined.

""The athleisure part of the business, after almost two years of rapid growth and a lot of consumption during work-from-home environment, is beginning to slow in the last two or three quarters,""
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail
managing director Ashish Dikshit told analysts. ""That's why there is a little bit of excess inventory. Innerwear is a more evergreen product and therefore, that's not a matter of concern."" Companies said there was a price increase across all apparel categories last year that has affected demand. Most companies are now either slashing price tags or offering steep discounts, hoping to clear unsold inventory.
""Last one-and-a-half years, the industry witnessed steep volatility in raw material prices and is now witnessing a disruptive pricing strategy. Tough pricing strategies adopted in the market are a short-term phenomenon and will put pressure on margin in near short term,"" Ramesh Agarwal, director, Rupa & Company, said at its earnings call.

Non-tariff barriers emerging as potent tool to disrupt legitimate textiles trade: AEPC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/non-tariff-barriers-emerging-as-potent-tool-to-disrupt-legitimate-textiles-trade-aepc/articleshow/102611992.cms,10-08-2023,"Non-tariff barriers
(NTBs) are gradually emerging as a potent tool to damage and even disrupt legitimate
textiles trade
,
apparel export promotion council
(
AEPC
) said on Thursday. As many as 131 NTB notifications are issued related to the textile sector since 2019 with Uganda at the top position with 71 notifications, it said.
It was followed by Ecuador (10), China (8), Taiwan (7), Israel (5), USA (4), and Peru (3).
These barriers include certifications, inspections, regulations, standards, SPS (sanitary and phyto-sanitary - related with plants and animals) measures, and technical barriers to trade (TBT).
These measures are by and large in conformity with the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
But when these measures are used unfairly, in violation of
WTO agreements
to discriminate against imports and restrict market access, then they become non-tariff barriers hampering legitimate trade.
Live Events
The council has organized a webinar on emerging non-tariff barriers in the apparel export sector with an aim to sensitize the industry about the issue.
Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary General, AEPC, said: ""NTBs have slowly but surely emerged as a potent tool to damage and even disrupt legitimate trade.""
Of late, innovative ways were being explored by developed economies like the European Union to restrict imports from developing countries, he said.
Legislations like CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) and EUDR (EU Deforestation Legislation) are violative of WTO agreements and bound to make Indian exports to the EU less competitive, he added.
""Ways and means need to be explored to handle the challenges arising out of these legislations,"" Thakur said.
Speaking during the webinar, Seetharaman Sampath, Co-founder, Sarvada Legal, said that these NTBs arise from different measures taken by governments and authorities in the form of laws, regulations, policies, conditions, restrictions or specific requirements, or prohibitions that protect the domestic industries from foreign competition.
""EU, US and UK are our top markets for the apparel sector and so we should be extra careful about their moves to bring any legislation/regulation in the nature of TBTs affecting the apparel sector,"" Sampath said.
Most countries follow a consultation process before a new TBT is introduced or an existing TBT is modified.
Indian industry must participate in the consultation process and report its apprehension and objections to the government at the initial stage of the law-making process itself rather than complaining after its entry into force, he added.
These barriers to trade can arise due to unreasonable/unjustified packaging, labelling, product standards, complex regulatory environment, additional trade documents like certificate of authenticity, occupational safety and health regulation, employment law.

RSWM Ltd to invest Rs 315 crore for expansion of Rajasthan unit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/rswm-ltd-to-invest-rs-315-crore-for-expansion-of-rajasthan-unit/articleshow/102396995.cms,03-08-2023,"RSWM Ltd
has decided to invest Rs 315 crore for the
expansion
of its compact
cotton yarn capacity
at its Lodha unit in Banswara, Rajasthan. Currently, the company’s
Banswara
unit's total spindle capacity is 95,376, and with the new investment, the spindle capacity is expected to increase by 51,072. The company is plans to increase the capacity in the current financial year.
The company supplies high-quality yarn to 90 countries globally. The decision to expand capacity comes due to the growing demand for cotton and the cotton industry. According to ICRA’s latest report, the demand for the cotton yarn industry is expected to improve by close to 10% in volume terms in FY2024 on a yearly basis. Additionally, statistics as per the
CareEdge
report reveal a similar story that the Indian cotton yarn industry is likely to record 5-7 percent growth in sales volume. As per operating margin, it is expected to expand by 1-1.50 percent in this fiscal due to domestic cotton prices alignment with international prices and a shift in demand from competing nations.
Riju Jhunjhunwala
, Chairman & MD, RSWM Ltd, said that. “We hope that the decision to expand our capacity will help fuel the next stage of growth for the cotton industry in India. We also seek to strengthen the economic ecosystem of the local region to provide jobs for the regional communities.""
He added ""Our country has one of the fastest-growing cotton-spinning businesses in the world. Moreover, there is an extensive market abroad for 100% combed compact cotton yarn. And this is an opportunity for us to tap.”

Viscose staple yarn industry revenues to grow 10-12%: CRISIL,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/viscose-staple-yarn-industry-revenues-to-grow-10-12-crisil/articleshow/102303011.cms,01-08-2023,"Revenue of the Indian
viscose staple yarn
(
VSY
) industry is set to grow 10-12% on-year to an all-time high of over $2.5 billion this fiscal on continued strong demand — similar pace to last fiscal, said
CRISIL Ratings
on Tuesday.
Even as yarn prices decline, though at a lower rate than raw material prices, overall profitability is likely to improve 200-300 basis points (bps). Strong balance sheets and improved cash flows will support the credit risk profiles of manufacturers, despite substantial debt-funded capital expenditure (capex).
A CRISIL Ratings analysis of VSY companies, accounting for over a fourth of the industry by revenue, indicates as much. VSY is an attractive alternative to cotton yarn because of its lower prices and comparable features. It logged a compound annual growth rate of 13% over the last three fiscals, higher than 5% for cotton yarn. During this period, VSY prices were relatively stable, ranging between Rs 200 and Rs 250 per kg. In contrast, cotton yarn prices ranged between Rs 200 and Rs 380 per kg. The removal of anti-dumping duty on imports of viscose staple fibre (
VSF
) in fiscal 2022 also helped steady VSY prices. Subsequently, VSY’s share of the spinning industry volume increased to over 10% last fiscal from under 7% in fiscal 2020.
Says Himank Sharma, Director, CRISIL Ratings Ltd, “Viscose spinners’ volume is expected to grow 15% on year this fiscal, supported by sustained domestic demand and a revival in export demand during the second half. Overall, segmental growth will be in low double digits.” With VSY makers’ revenue improving and spreads between VSY and VSF expanding to Rs 55-58 per kg, the operating margin is likely to improve to 11-12%. Higher viscose yarn imports from
China
and weaker global demand impacted spreads last fiscal, causing the margin to shrink 800-900 bps.
Margin is projected to recover this fiscal as prices of major raw materials (wood pulp and chemicals) moderate, nearing steady-state levels of 12-13%. VSY makers have increased capacity by 50% in the past three fiscals. They are expected to add another ~15% capacity this fiscal with an outlay of ~Rs 600 crore, likely to be funded by a 1:1 debt-to-equity ratio.

Says Jayashree Nandakumar, Director, CRISIL Ratings Ltd, “The capital-intensive nature of the VSY segment has resulted in players regularly contracting debt for capacity expansion. However, strong balance sheets have ensured credit risk profiles of players remain comfortable despite continuous capex.”
Gearing is expected to improve to 0.85 times as on March 31, 2024, from 1.0 times as on March 31, 2023, while the interest coverage ratio is likely to improve to 6 times this fiscal, from 4.5 times last fiscal, on the back of higher profitability. Any adverse impact of the levy of anti-dumping duty on VSF, leading to higher input costs for viscose spinners or lower domestic demand, along with a further slowdown in global demand, will bear watching.

“NITI Aayog has sought views of the textile industry on tax related matters that are impeding the growth of the sector,” a senior government official said, adding that the Aayog will firm up its view and make suitable recommendations to the finance ministry for consideration.
Some of the issues raised by the industry, at the recently held stakeholder consultation, included the import duty on cotton and textile machinery and the inverted duty structure in manmade fibre textile value chain.
Industry has sought removal of 11% import duty on cotton as a steep rise in
cotton prices
has eroded the competitiveness of the Indian textile industry.

duty on manmade yarn to 10% from the existing 5% to check rising imports along with higher imports of apparel from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were discussed,” said another official.
Exempting job works in the MSME sector from the goods and services tax (GST), and reducing GST on airfares were the other issues. Industry said that higher GST is making airfare uncompetitive.
“This needs to be corrected amid demand slowdown in our major markets and demand is not expected to pickup before September,” said one industry representative.
India’s exports of cotton yarn, made-ups, handloom products, manmade yarn and fabric, and ready made garments of all textiles were around $7.8 billion in April-June 2023-24, 14.5% lower than $9 billion in the corresponding period a year ago.
Officials from Invest India also participated in the meeting where issues related to import duty on cotton and textile machinery, and the inverted duty structure in manmade fibre textile value chain, were raised.
India’s total textile and apparel export was around $36 billion in FY23 and the target is to achieve $100 billion in the next 5-6 years, taking the combined value of the sector along with domestic consumption to $250 billion.
Industry emphasised that there should be no change in any tax-related policy during the financial year and policies should be maintained for the entire fiscal.
Market research firm IMARC Group has pegged India’s textile and apparel market to reach $387.3 billion by 2028.

Japan has immense opportunities for Indian apparel exporters: AEPC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/japan-has-immense-opportunities-for-indian-apparel-exporters-aepc/articleshow/101918168.cms,19-07-2023,"Decline in Chinese garment exports to Japan provides an immense opportunity for the Indian apparel industry to boost shipments to the island nation,
AEPC
said on Wednesday. The Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) said a strong Indian garment industry with its unique offerings has a huge scope for Japanese trading companies to source from India.
Members of the council are participating in the 12th edition of the
India Tex Trends Fair
in Tokyo.
Speaking at the inauguration of the fair, AEPC Chairman
Naren Goenka
said over 180 Indian exhibitors are participating in the fair.
""Apparel imports into Japan have witnessed a positive mark in the last three years. Japan's total import from the world, which was USD 28.49 billion in 2018, has now risen to USD 46.72 billion,"" he said adding Japan is the fourth largest garment importer in the world after the US, Germany and France.
Out of the total garment import of USD 23 billion by Japan, India's share is just one per cent.
Live Events
""We hold a strong business opportunity in Japan reflected by the fact that China, which has been a dominant garment supplier to Japan, has witnessed a decline in the past five years giving significant advantage to India. Moreover, the duty-free access for Indian ready-made garments post-Indo-Japan free trade agreement as against about 9 per cent for China and Turkey is a big advantage for us,"" Goenka said.
Sharing similar views, vice-chairman of the council
Sudhir Sekhri
said as India has the largest raw material availability of cotton, jute, silk and wool in the world, supported by the world's second largest spinning and weaving capacity, and 95 per cent value addition, India offers to the world a complete value chain solution from farm to fashion.
The government has taken several steps such as the production linked incentive scheme and
PM MITRA scheme
to support the textile industry's growth and development.
Seminars and business delegation meetings were also held to strengthen understanding and collaborations on the sidelines of the fair.

Apparel units suspend production amid decline in orders from global brands,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/apparel-units-suspend-production-amid-decline-in-orders-from-global-brands/articleshow/101836411.cms,17-07-2023,"More than 20% of the apparel exporting units in
Tiruppur
and
Noida
have suspended manufacturing operations due to a fall in orders from international brands amid a global slowdown.
Many units, which are mostly medium and small enterprises, are also in trouble as they are not being able to service the loans that they have taken from banks. The shutdown will help them keep a check on operational costs.
Global brands have not placed any major orders for the Christmas season, Tiruppur exporters said.
""We are now waiting for spring-summer orders for next year which are placed in September. The global brands have a lot of inventory with them, which is why they are not keen to place fresh orders. Also, high energy costs in Europe and rate hikes are also keeping the buyers away,"" said Raja Shanmugam, owner of knitwear firm
Warsaw International
and a former president of the
Tiruppur Exporters Association
.
The slowdown in the key markets of the US and
European Union
has hit knitwear exports from the Tiruppur cluster, Asia's largest textiles export hub, which accounts for more than half of India's knitwear exports. There are 30,000 units, including ancillary plants, in the Tiruppur cluster.

The Russia-Ukraine war has impacted apparel exports from Tiruppur in fiscal 2023. Exports declined by 5.22% to $4.26 billion in FY23 from $4.49 billion in FY22. ""It will be lesser in FY24 compared to FY23,"" Shanmugam said.
In the
Noida Apparel Export Cluster
, nearly 70% of the units have a month's order in hand. ""Only the big units have good orders in hand, but the medium and smaller units are suffering from very less orders.
Nearly 20% of the units have closed down temporarily. However, we are expecting that order flow will regain within the next two to three months' time,"" said Lalit Thukral, president of the Noida Apparel Export Cluster which houses 3,000 units that export ready-made garments worth ₹30,000 crore a year.
""We are hearing that inventory lying with the global brands has almost come to an end and they will start placing orders with us,"" he said.
The apparel exporting units in Tiruppur and Noida are not considering any headcount cuts despite their low-order position.
""It will not be easy for us to find skilled workers when the order situation improves. Already we have seen a large exodus of migrant workers during Covid,"" Thukral added.

Asset Reconstruction Company
to initiate insolvency proceedings against
Uniworth Textiles Ltd
(UTL), and remanded the matter back to hear it again. A two-member
NCLAT
bench comprising justices Rakesh Kumar Jain and Naresh Salecha said the
NCLT
had erred in rejecting the application filed under Section 7 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code by Asset Reconstruction Company on the ground of limitation.
""The appeal therefore succeeds and the impugned order dated March 17, 2020 is set aside. The case is remanded back to the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) for decision on the merit of the application in accordance with the law,"" said NCLAT in its 36-page order.
It had directed both parties to appear before
the NCLT on July 28, 2023.
Meanwhile, NCLAT also clarified it is not expressing any opinion regarding the merits of the case and the same needs to be decided by the NCLT ""uninfluenced by any of the observations of this Appellate Tribunal"".
Earlier, the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had on March 17, 2020 dismissed the plea, which was challenged by Asset Reconstruction Company before NCLAT.

UTL had taken loans of Rs 41.50 crore from the Industrial Finance Corporation of India Limited (IFCIL) and Investment Corporation of India Ltd (ICICI) in 1992. The loan documents were registered between the corporate debtor, IFCIL and ICICI, respectively.
Both of the lenders later assigned their debts to the Asset Reconstruction Company. In 2004, UTL initiated proceedings under Sick Industrial Companies before the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction and the account was declared as NPA (non-performing asset) in August 2007.
The proceedings continued till 2013 and were abated. Later appellant filed an Application to the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Nagpur, which was allowed on December 4, 2018.
Later UTL came forward for settlement with the appellant and sent a proposal on September 19, 2016 to clear its dues submitted by five companies, namely -
Uniworth
Limited, Uniworth International Limited, Indoworth Limited, Textprint Overseas Limited and
Uniworth Textiles
Limited.
It paid Rs 51.10 crore, which was adjusted, however despite acknowledgement of debts, it was not getting payment of outstanding dues from UTL, Asset Reconstruction alleged.
Hence, on November 22, 2018, it issued a letter for revocation of the terms of the settlement. Later, it moved NCLT to claim an amount of Rs 205.83 crore. However, it was dismissed primarily on the ground of limitation.

trade
deal.
New Delhi's $200 million worth of exports of home textiles and garments to the UK under its Developing Countries Trading Scheme (
DCTS
) which came into effect last week will lose this benefit till December 31, 2025 while
Bangladesh
,
Pakistan
and
Sri Lanka
will continue to receive them.
""The UK has suddenly suspended preferential
customs duty
rates on Indian textile imports and it does not seem to be in line with the trade policy direction and when the two sides are negotiating a free trade agreement,"" said a representative of the cotton textile industry.
The DCTS has replaced the UK's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) Scheme which provided a 20% concession on the overall import duty of 12% for Indian home textile and garments thereby offering a concessional duty of 9.6%.
Live Events
The DCTS has three preference tiers -Comprehensive Preference for least developed countries, Enhanced Preference would continue to receive zero duty in textile and clothing items, and
Standard Preference
which has only India and
Indonesia
as they are not considered ""economically vulnerable"" and the duty preference of 20% would be withdrawn.

Wedding clothing manufactures reports average sale due to economic slowdown,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/wedding-clothing-manufactures-reports-average-sale-due-to-economic-slowdown/articleshow/101331958.cms,28-06-2023,"Wedding clothing manufactures have reported average to poor sales in the past season, according to a survey by
Clothing Manufacturing Association of India
(
CMAI
), which took feedback from 110 wedding clothing manufacturers to assess the business trends in the wedding season that was recently concluded.
As many as 77% of the survey respondents indicated average to poor sales in the past season. More than 60% of the respondents attributed the weak performance to the general economic slowdown, while 14% attributed it to high prices. However, 13% respondents felt the lesser number of auspicious dates as compared to the previous season contributed to the drop in sales.
“Currently the market is seeing a fairly significant slowdown, which has been caused by the overall inflationary conditions in the market. The first quarter of the current financial year is likely to be disappointing for the industry, and the impact is being felt by both the value as well as the upper segments of consumers,” said
Rajesh Masand
, President,
Clothing Manufacturers Association of India
(CMAI).
When compared to the wedding season in the year 2022, 83% of the respondents revealed that there has been no growth as compared to the previous season. Most respondents (40%) indicated a drop in sales between 10% - 25% over the previous year.
A large majority of almost 85% of the respondents indicated that economically priced products fared better than the more expensive varieties. Lighter embroideries and pastel colours were more in demand as per the survey results.

“Exposure to western culture with accessibility to content over social media platforms are influencing the dressing patterns, and fashion sense amongst the youth, which is causing a gradual shift from traditional clothing to western clothing especially in the women’s wear segment. On the other hand, some sort of a ‘return to tradition’ is being seen in the men’s wear segment, with more men wanting to wear traditional clothing during festivals and weddings,” said
Rahul Mehta
, Chief Mentor, Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI).
The apparel industry has been growing at a fairly consistent rate of 8-10% per annum. Post-pandemic the apparel industry witnessed a revival in the year 2022 with consumers going back to the physical stores and markets, and the year 2022-23 is estimated to have grown by between 15-20%.
However, with the costs of raw materials as well over all cost of production having gone up substantially, this growth has been entirely price-led, and the volumes would still be below the previous year by 3-5%.

Textile slump mutes debt-laden Sumeet Industries appeal for suitors,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/textile-slump-mutes-debt-laden-sumeet-industries-appeal-for-suitors/articleshow/101288246.cms,27-06-2023,"Bids for the debt-laden textile company
Sumeet Industries
have been weaker than lenders' expectations as high input costs and weak
demand
in the industry have kept large bidders away.
Banks received bids ranging from ₹90 crore to ₹150 crore indicating a recovery of just 22%, much lower than the ₹250 crore or 40% recovery expected.
Lenders will now negotiate with individual bidders hoping to improve recovery and the value of their debt, people familiar with the matter said.
""Bids have been weak because raw material costs in textiles especially those linked to oil prices have gone up by about 15% in the last one year. At the same time, demand has not really picked up. All these have impacted margins for textile companies which has hit appetite for Sumeet,"" said a person familiar with the process.
Last week ET reported that two conglomerates -
Reliance Industries
and Kolkata-based Chatterjee Group company
MCPI
- have not submitted bids after earlier expressing interest in buying Sumeet Industries.

Among the five bidders that submitted binding bids, UP-based Bhola Ram Papers & Power is the highest at ₹150 crore. But even half of that amount is expected as a deferred
payment
in monthly instalments over the next two or three years, said a second person aware of the process.
""Banks plan to negotiate hard with all serious bidders. These are just initial bids and the situation may change in the future. There are more than two months left for the
NCLT
monitored process with a court-granted extension too possible, so lenders are in no hurry,"" the second person said.
The bids are even lower than the ₹225 crore offered by the promoter in a one-time settlement with banks almost two years ago. Sumeet Industries had tried to restructure its loans and even received the mandatory RP4 credit rating, based on which a restructuring plan was proposed. However, banks could not agree on the details of the plan, so this company was taken to
bankruptcy
court last December.
Bhilosa Industries and Bhumi Tex Industries of Mumbai, Gujarat's
Eagle Group
and Silvassa-based Geelon Industries are the other bidders in the fray. Eagle Group is the second highest bidder, though the exact amount of its bid could not be ascertained.
Resolution professional Satyendra Khorania did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Sumeet Industries owes lenders and operational creditors led by the
Bank of Baroda
(BoB) a total of ₹667 crore. BoB is the largest creditor to Sumeet with a 65% share of the company's dues to financial creditors, followed by
IDBI Bank
(21%).
Other lenders are Central
Bank
of India,
Canara Bank
,
Union Bank of India
and Germany-based
Oldenburgische Landesbank AG

British India Corporation
is expected to disburse Rs 80.17 crore of overdue salaries and retirement benefits from Saturday. “The total amount to be disbursed for overdue salaries and retirement benefits to BIC employees comes up to Rs 80.17 crore,” the ministry said in a statement.
The
Union Budget
2023 had approved a disbursement towards the long-awaited resolution of these dues. The amount allocated for salary and retirement dues for 1,101 employees across the BIC Head Office in Kanpur, and two branch offices is Rs 74.71 crore.
“An amount of Rs 5.46 crore has been allocated for the employer’s part of the EPF and ESI contributions,” the ministry said in a statement.
Production activity had stopped in 2009 at both units in Dhariwal and Lalimli Kanpur.
As per the statement, “the much-needed relief” will benefit the employees at BIC Head Office in Kanpur and its units at Cawnpore Woollen Mills branch (Lalimli) in Kanpur and New Egerton Woollen Mills branch in Dhariwal, whose salary and retirement dues have been overdue since June 2019 and June 2017, respectively.

Sumeet Industries owes lenders and operational creditors led by
Bank of Baroda
(BoB) a total of ₹667 crore. The company was admitted for bankruptcy proceedings in December last year, after a failed attempt to restructure its loans.
""Received resolution plans from prospective resolution applicants and due to some confidential and price sensitive information, currently we cannot disclose the name of the resolution applicants who have submitted the bids,"" said Satyendra Khorania, the resolution professional for the company. All the proposals will be placed before the committee of creditors ""and after that, the details will be provided at public domain if found suitable"", he said in an emailed response to ET's questions.
BoB is the largest creditor to the company with a 65% share of the company's dues to financial creditors, followed by
IDBI Bank
(21%). Other lenders are Central Bank of India,
Canara Bank
,
Union Bank of India
and Germany-based Oldenburgische Landesbank AG.
With
Reliance
and MCPI choosing not to bid, lenders are hoping that the bidders in the fray will compete aggressively, resulting in better value for them.
""One way to look at it is that no bidder will now be reluctant to participate. Previously it has been seen that whenever a large company like
RIL
is in the fray, others are reluctant to put in aggressive bids. Banks will now have to evaluate the bids to ensure they are financially and legally compliant to weed out any ineligible bidders,"" said a second person aware of the process.
Sumeet Industries had tried to restructure its loans and even received the mandatory RP4 credit rating, based on which a restructuring plan was proposed. However, banks could not agree on the details of the plan, so this company was taken to the bankruptcy court.
Resolution plans with an opinion or rating of RP4 are considered to have a moderate degree of safety regarding the timely servicing of financial obligations.
The promoter had also agreed to a one-time settlement with banks, but not all lenders had agreed on the proposal.
The latest results show that the company had made a loss of ₹59 crore in the
fiscal year
ended March 31, 2023, as
revenue
fell and expenditure remained elevated.

Piyush Goyal
has urged the industry to collaborate and partner for research and development and innovation to jointly achieve greater strides in the textiles sector. He was chairing the Industry Interaction on 'Investment Opportunities in the
Textiles Industry
under PM MITRA Scheme' here on Tuesday.
The Minister of Textiles,
Commerce
and Industry and Consumer Affairs, Food & Public
Distribution
also praised Gujarat, Karnataka, MP, Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and UP for providing a thriving ecosystem for textiles manufacturing.
Goyal commended the industry for their enthusiasm to set up and expand businesses in the upcoming Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks.
The minister further encouraged the industry to take benefit from the existing attractive schemes of the
Ministry of Textiles
, including the National Technical Textiles Mission and Scheme For Capacity Building In Textile Sector (Samarth).
He also suggested setting up a dedicated Invest India desk in the Ministry of Textiles to assist and handhold investors looking to set up or expand their manufacturing base to meet increasing global demand in the sector.
Live Events
The industry interaction revolved around the themes of Sustainability, introduction of R&D centres and making upcoming factories in the PM MITRA, ESG (environmental, social and governance) compliant and ensuring value added products are manufactured in the upcoming parks.
""The Minister emphasized the need for phase-by-phase development of these parks for efficient utilization of resources and better integration of the textile
value chain
. It was suggested that two 5 member Action Teams be set up to study ESG norms and model park design in line with global leading practices for upcoming units in the PM
MITRA parks
,"" the Textiles Ministry said.
Inspired by the 5F vision (Farm to fibre; fibre to factory; factory to fashion; fashion to foreign) of the Prime Minister of building an Aatmanirbhar Bharat and positioning India strongly on the global textiles map, the scheme for setting up of 7 PM MITRA Parks was announced in Union Budget for 2021-22.
PM MITRA scheme will offer the opportunity to create an Integrated Textiles Value Chain right from spinning, weaving, processing/dyeing, and printing to garment manufacturing at one location and will reduce
logistics
cost of Industry.
It is expected to generate around 1 lakh direct and 2 lakh indirect employment per park, spreading over 1,000 acres each and attracting proposed investments of around Rs 70,000 crore. These parks are envisaged to be located at sites that have inherent strength for the textile industry to flourish and have necessary linkages to succeed.

Embracing the authentic craftsmanship of the Santhal community, TRIFED will highlight the essence of Madurkathi, an integral component of Medinipur's renowned weaving heritage. Meticulously handcrafted by skilled tribals, these mats encapsulate the cultural legacy of West Bengal.
Similar to the intricate craftsmanship involved in weaving a saree using a
Fly Shuttle Handloom
, these mats intricately intertwine cotton yarn as vertical threads (tana) and Madurkathi as horizontal threads (bona).
Beyond their function as mats, these creations offer a range of benefits. Their non-conductive nature and exceptional sweat-absorbing properties make them indispensable in West Bengal's hot and humid climate. Additionally, they hold great significance in religious rituals and practices.
The collaboration between TRIFED and the Ministry of Ayush not only provides economic support to tribal artisans but also amplifies the recognition and preservation of India's diverse cultural heritage. By promoting tribal artistry through the supply of yoga mats, the government reinforces its commitment to empower marginalized communities and nurture a sense of pride in their rich traditions.
Sabai Grass Yoga Mats
Rooted in the serene beauty of
Simplipal Reserve
, the Sabai Grass Yoga Mats epitomize the deep bond between the
Tribals of Mayurbhanj
, Odisha, and the lush surrounding landscapes. Crafted with natural materials, these mats showcase the rich artistic traditions passed down through generations.
The creation of Sabai grass mats begins with the meticulous process of harvesting and sorting the grass. Afterward, the grass is dried and treated to enhance its pliability. Skilled weavers employ a loom with vertical warp threads, deftly interlacing Sabai grass weft threads horizontally using twining techniques that ensure long-lasting durability. To introduce a burst of colors and patterns, dyed grass is skillfully incorporated.
The weavers maintain precise tension as they weave, carefully trimming excess grass and securing loose ends. Each finished mat undergoes rigorous quality inspections and may receive optional treatments for added durability and aesthetic appeal. This careful craftsmanship results in stunning mats that seamlessly blend aesthetics with longevity, representing sustainable artistry at its finest.
Renowned for its lightweight and flexibility, Sabai grass is skillfully transformed by artisans into a diverse array of exquisite products, including mats, baskets, cots, furniture, wall hangings, decorative boxes, and coasters. The Sabai grass mats, predominantly made from a blend of cotton and Sabai grass, offer exceptional absorbency and comfort, making them indispensable companions for yoga enthusiasts and practitioners seeking an eco-friendly experience.
The production of these unique mats involves the expertise of artisans such as Smt.
Usharani Naik
, a member of the Bathudi tribe from the village of Gohaldihi in Mayurbhanj, Odisha, and Smt.
Gurucharan Naik
, a skilled artisan hailing from the Bathudi tribe in the village of Betnoti, Mayurbhanj, Odisha.
These artisans, representing diverse tribes in Odisha, contribute their talents and cultural heritage to the crafting of these top-quality yoga mats. Through their involvement, they not only enhance economic empowerment but also preserve and promote the invaluable artistic legacy of their communities.
By seamlessly blending natural materials with the artistic traditions of the Santhal community, these mats offer individuals a serene and eco-friendly yoga experience. They stand as a testament to the resilience and creativity of tribal artisans, embodying the harmonious relationship between human craftsmanship and the abundant natural environment.

Chinese textiles coming to India to be tested for Azo dyes presence,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/chinese-textiles-coming-to-india-to-be-tested-for-azo-dyes-presence/articleshow/100999149.cms,15-06-2023,"India on Wednesday removed China from the list of countries whose
textiles
entering the country are exempt from tests for the presence of
azo dyes
. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (
DGFT
) updated the list in which the UK, Canada, Australia, South Korea and Japan have been added while China was removed.
“(The) list of countries exempted from testing for the presence of azo dyes in textiles and textiles articles is updated,” DGFT said in a public notice.
India imported textiles and its products worth $925 million in FY23, and apparel worth $240 million from China.
“Azo dyes are known to be hazardous to health and it’s a good move on health grounds. However, this is a non-tariff barrier which will add to the importers’ cost and lead to delays,” said an industry representative.
As per the representative, Beijing is expected to push its textile and products through its foreign trade agreement partners such as Japan and South Korea, and those in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership such as Australia, which are exempt from testing.

150 years of Levi's 501: How the brand managed not to fade away,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/150-years-of-levis-501-how-the-brand-managed-not-to-fade-away/articleshow/100938376.cms,12-06-2023,"In 1873, 150 years ago, the iconic blue jeans were born in San Francisco when businessman
Levi Strauss
patented work trousers with metal rivets. One-and-a-half centuries later,
Levi's
has survived not just merely as a brand but as an arbiter of diverse cultural trends.
Originally, the jeans were work overalls made for miners during the California gold rush. They were rugged, didn't get soiled easily, and could be worn over regular trousers. From being the apparel of the working class to chic clothing, Levi's became a versatile popular brand.
From gold miners, the jeans came to be associated with cowboys, popularised by John Wayne in his Western movies. When Marlon Brando wore them with boots and black leather motorcycle jacket, Levi's became a symbol for rebels. They went on to become the uniform of the counterculture and the Civil Rights movement. They were a hit with soldiers during the Second World War. Hordes of youth were spotted wearing
Levi's 501
when the Berlin Wall came down. Miners, cowboys, biker gangs, Hollywood actors, activists, rock stars, protestors, handymen, politicians, professors, angst-ridden youth and the cool crowd, all have worn Levi's 501 to make their respective style statements.
Not that Levi Strauss and Co. did not adapt the jeans to the times. They began with a single back pocket, button fly, a cinch at the back, buttons for suspenders and a crotch rivet too, an altogether different species from the current form. But they still retain the Arcuate stitch design on the back pockets, the rivets, and the famous leather patch with the drawing of two horses pulling apart a pair of pants which was added in 1886.
The Levi's crisis
Live Events
A brand with such versatility and popularity was, of course, a business success too. Though Levi's was the original denim brand, the denim revolution created several popular jeans brands that emerged as rivals in time. It also could not compete with the new designer avatars of jeans such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Gap. In the late 90's, Levi Strauss and Co. was on the decline. Its sales fell drastically, and it had to close factories and stores and lay off nearly half of its staff.
The vast heritage behind Levi Strauss and Co. ironically became its main obstacle as it did not know how to reinvent itself. The jeans did adpat to changing times but the company could not make too many changes because heritage was its main selling point. For the next decade, the sales kept dropping and the company lost market share to rivals, until it hired a brand expert from
Procter and Gamble
with three decades of experience. In 2011, the board hired
Chip Bergh
as the CEO who went on to turn the company around with the canny insights he had gathered at the retailer.
Bergh gets to know Levi's
""As I began doing research to prepare for my first meeting with its board chairman, I was surprised by what I found. I’d guessed that Levi Strauss had revenue of about $10 billion. But in fact its sales had peaked at $7 billion in 1997 and then fallen to $4.1 billion in five years. From 2001 to 2010 they never exceeded $4.5 billion. The more I studied the company’s recent history, the more it looked like The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,"" Bergh recalled, writing in the Harvard Business Review a few years ago.
Bergh was shocked when he asked employee at a town hall meeting how many of them thought the company was performing well. Three-quarters of the attendees raised a hand. ""A lack of urgency, of financial discipline, and of data discipline permeated the culture,"" Bergh said. He started with changing almost the entire top team that reported to him.
The insight at Bengaluru
During his second month in the job, Bergh visited Bangalore and found the tagline for the next advertising campaign as well as the guiding light for his new job. He asked his people in Bengaluru to set up an in-home visit. P&G relied heavily on in-homes which yielded valuable insights from customers.
The customer he met with was a 29-year-old professional woman from an upper-middle-class family, who lived with her parents and had studied at Cambridge. She had about 10 pairs of jeans of different brands and she talked about what she liked about each pair.
""She had two pairs of Levi’s, and we talked about those last. She pointed to one pair and said, “These are my go-to jeans—the ones I’ll wear day-to-day, like if I’m going to meet a girlfriend.” Then she focused on the second pair. “These are the jeans I wore at university,” she said. “They don’t even fit me anymore, but I can’t bear to part with them because of all the memories.” Then she said something arresting: “You wear other jeans, but you live in Levi’s.” I still get goosebumps when I recall that moment. To me, her words captured the essence of our brand. “Live in Levi’s” became our advertising tagline. That experience is an illustration of how much value can come from listening to consumers,"" Bergh wrote in HBR.
The turnaround strategy
After six months on the job, Bergh and his team rolled out a plan consisting of four key pieces — build profitable core (80% of profits came from men’s jeans and Dockers); expand for more (seize the opportunity in women’s clothing); become a leading omnichannel retailer (grow sales in the company’s own stores and online); and achieve operational excellence (cut costs, drive cash flow, become more data driven and financially disciplined).
The new strategy provided funds for investment in the company’s
Eureka
Innovation Lab. In 2013, it created a revamped women’s denim line. A second big investment was the purchase of naming rights for the San Francisco 49ers’ new stadium—a 20-year, $220 million deal, which was to put the company in the limelight it needed.
Burgh wanted the company to act like a 160-year-old start-up. “We’ve got scale, heritage, authenticity, awareness and global reach,” he told Beeketing in an interview, “But if you’re a multi-billion dollar company that’s existed for over 100 years, you wish you had agility, focus, innovation and optimism of a start-up. That’s why the future will be better than the past.""
Burgh expanded the range to women’s clothing instead of just menswear and jeans. He opened up untapped markets such as Russia, India and China. He launched e-commerce with experimental features such as a virtual stylist, an AI-powered chatbot that helps customers find the perfect pair of jeans. He roped in celebrities in innovative ad campaigns such as for the Levi's trucker jacket as well as linked the company to contemporary issues such as conserving water. Burgh got popular by saying one did not need to wash one's jeans for two years.
Bergh's multi-pronged strategy bore fruit and the company revenue hit a record $4.9 billion in two decades. In 2019, the company filed documents to list itself on the New York Stock Exchange, seeking to return to public markets after more than three decades. The company fetched a higher price than expected.
In November last year, Bergh put his succession plan in motion with the appointment of Michelle Gass to the new position of president, reporting to Bergh. Gass brings direct-to-consumer experience to Levi Strauss and Co., having led the transformation strategy at Kohl’s. Bergh had brought in Gass who had worked with him earlier at P&G.
Levi Strauss and Co. in India
When in several countries, especially the company’s US home market, consumers are battening down the hatches and pulling back on spending due to the fear of recession, there’s a high degree of consumer optimism in India, Bergh told ET recently in an interview.
Despite inflation, lifestyle and discretionary segments in the country have seen double-digit growth, driven by pent-up demand, pandemic-related savings and continued casualisation at workplaces, a trend that has helped brands such as Levi’s.
Levi Strauss and Co., which opened its first door in India three decades ago, now has over 400 stores and competes with relatively newer entrants such as Zara and H&M in a market where youngsters are increasingly embracing western-style clothing. While fast-fashion rivals create affordable, copycat versions of the latest trends or designer wear and make them available to shoppers in double-quick time, Levi’s has a different strategy.
“The thing that separates us from Zara and H&M is that we are the opposite of fast fashion — we are slow fashion,” said Bergh. “Just being self-critical, probably we don’t have enough fashion in our line today here in India. But what we have got is a brand that is highly differentiated versus others and so for the people that really want quality denim, they are still going to come to Levi’s.""
The company is trying to push more non-denim clothing and women’s apparel as it seeks to broaden its share of the consumer’s wardrobe.
India is increasingly becoming a talent hub for the retailer globally. For instance, more than a year ago, Levi's named
Sanjeev Mohanty
, managing director of South Asia-Middle East and Africa for Levi Strauss & Co, based out of India, as its managing director for the US and Canada. Singh was also elevated and given additional roles in corporate strategy and global retail real estate.

"Political stability helping drive investments to India: Chip Bergh, CEO, Levi Strauss",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/political-stability-helping-drive-investments-to-india-chip-bergh-ceo-levi-strauss/articleshow/100607095.cms,30-05-2023,"New Delhi:
Chip Bergh
, the global chief executive of denim maker
Levi Strauss
& Co., said
political stability
has helped Indians stay optimistic about the future, driving consumer demand as well as investment by multinationals.
“Having a stable government has definitely helped,” Bergh told ET in an interview. “It is part of what gives some of these consumers the confidence that we are living in a period of relative stability, especially relative to prior periods. In terms of investments from around the world, it creates an environment where you feel like your investments are relatively safe.”
In several countries, especially the company’s US home market, consumers are battening down the hatches and pulling back on spending due to the fear of recession. Compared with that, there’s a high degree of consumer optimism in India, according to Bergh.
The company said India will play a larger role in its global supply chain, not just in apparel but in other consumer businesses as well.
“We believe we have got a very bright future in parts of Asia,” said Bergh, 65, sporting all-Levi’s merchandise — tan leather belt, blue trucker jacket and jeans paired with a made-in-India T-shirt. “I think we are going to see continued investment, maybe even accelerated investment in some of these markets. And I think India would be very, very high on the list.”
Live Events
Despite
inflation
, lifestyle and discretionary segments in the country have seen double-digit growth, driven by pent-up demand, pandemic-related savings and continued casualisation at workplaces, a trend that has helped brands such as Levi’s. It helps that the brand has an iconography enshrined in popular culture, whether it’s the 501 jeans or the leather patch showing two horses trying to pull apart a pair of pants.
“There’s this greater resilience with consumers in some of the emerging markets as they are used to economic turmoil, political turmoil, disruption, and that builds resilience in them,” said Bergh, who spent nearly three decades with
Procter
& Gamble before coming to Levi’s.
The San Francisco-based jeans maker, which opened its first door in India three decades ago, now has over 400 stores and competes with relatively newer entrants such as Zara and H&M in a market where youngsters are increasingly embracing western-style clothing. While fast-fashion rivals create affordable, copycat versions of the latest trends or designer wear and make them available to shoppers in double-quick time, Levi’s has a different strategy.
“The thing that separates us from Zara and H&M is that we are the opposite of fast fashion — we are slow fashion,” said Bergh, who joined Levi’s in 2011, took it public, turned the brand around and made it a $6.2 billion company. “Just being self-critical, probably we don’t have enough fashion in our line today here in India. But what we have got is a brand that is highly differentiated versus others and so for the people that really want quality denim, they are still going to come to Levi’s.”
Over the past decade, it has also consolidated franchisees down to two dozen from over 80. It’s opened a few company-owned and operated shops that are significantly larger than the average 2,000 square foot store size.
The company posted a 58% year-on-year increase in net sales in India to Rs 1,154 crore in FY22, as per the latest available filing. However, unlike rivals that report retail sales, Levi’s revenues are not comparable because sales are accounted at wholesale prices to franchise partners.
A decade ago, competition from global brands as well as a rash of local labels had resulted in Levi’s drifting off the youth radar. That’s changed, according to the company. And, it’s now one of the most democratic brands in the world, spanning all demographic segments.
“Our sweet spot was kind of in the 20 to 35-year-old range. But at the same time, we have 40-year-olds, 50-year-olds coming into the store to buy Levi’s,” said Bergh. “So, we are very democratic and cross-cut across all income levels, all ethnicities, all regions of the world in all ages. And that is hard to do from a marketing standpoint, hard to sustain over the long term.”
In addition, India is increasingly becoming a talent hub for the retailer globally. For instance, more than a year ago, Levi's named Sanjeev Mohanty, managing director of South Asia-Middle East and Africa for Levi Strauss & Co, based out of India, as its managing director for the US and Canada. Singh was also elevated and given additional roles in corporate strategy and global retail real estate.
Levi’s sells more than three tops for every bottom in key markets worldwide. India is an exception, as people buy one bottom for every top on average. The company is trying to push more non-denim clothing and women’s apparel as it seeks to broaden its share of the consumer’s wardrobe.

"Reliance, MCPI among 8 in race for textile manufacturer Sumeet Industries",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/reliance-mcpi-among-8-in-race-for-textile-manufacturer-sumeet-industries/articleshow/99795581.cms,26-04-2023,"Reliance Industries
, India's largest private sector company by revenue, and Kolkata-based
MCPI
are among eight companies that have expressed interest to take over debt-laden textile manufacturer
Sumeet Industries
, documents accessed by ET showed.
These companies have officially submitted their interest along with supporting documents earlier this month and will be now scrutinised by the resolution professional before calling for formal bids for the company.
The Surat-based yarn and polyester maker Sumeet owes lenders and operational creditors led by the
Bank of Baroda
(BoB) a total of ₹667 crore. The company was admitted to the bankruptcy court in December last year after a failed attempt to restructure its loans.
BoB is the largest creditor to the company with 65% of dues to financial creditors, followed by
IDBI Bank
, which corners 21% of dues. Other lenders to the company are
Central Bank of India
,
Canara Bank
,
Union Bank of India
and Germany-based Oldenburgische Landesbank AG.
""This company has been in trouble for the last couple of years and had also tried to restructure its loans. Even the mandatory RP4 credit rating was received based on which a restructuring plan was proposed. However, banks could not agree on the details of the plan so this company was taken to the bankruptcy court,"" said a person familiar with the developments.
Live Events
Resolution plans with an opinion or rating of RP4 are considered to have a moderate degree of safety regarding the timely servicing of financial obligations.
""The restructuring plan offered by the company envisaged a recovery of 45% on the gross outstanding dues but it was spread over a period of five years, which was not acceptable to banks. Subsequently, a large public sector bank also agreed to a one-time settlement with the promoters but some other banks were determined to get more. Hence this process was started,"" said a second person aware of the situation.
The interest from Reliance Industries and MCPI has raised lenders' expectations from the resolution.
Other interested bidders include UP-based Bhola Ram Papers & Power, Mumbai-based Bhilosa Industries and Bhumi Tex Industries, and Gujarat-based Eagle Group and Geelon Industries.
Diamond trader Chunibhai Gajera has also expressed interest in the debt-laden company.
Reliance, MCPI and Bhilosa Industries did not reply to an email seeking comment. Other bidders could not be immediately contacted. Resolution professional Satyendra Khorania also did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Sumeet posted a loss of ₹25 crore in the quarter ended December 2022 despite a rise in revenues as expenses remained elevated. The company's shares ended at ₹2.68 a piece on Wednesday.
Sumeet's purified terephthalic acid (PTA) capacity is an attractive proposition for companies like Reliance and MCPI, which were losing bidders to take over
JBF
Petrochemicals last year. PTA is used to make polyester value chain products used in consumer goods, textile and packaging industries.

Price hikes help apparel market grow 15% in FY23,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/price-hikes-help-apparel-market-grow-15-in-fy23/articleshow/99714100.cms,24-04-2023,"India's
apparel market
expanded 15% during 2022-23 but sales growth was entirely price hike led as volumes or products people bought fell 3%, according to the
Clothing Manufacturers Association of India
(CMAI).
While sales growth has breached pre-Covid levels, the segment could see demand recovery only during Diwali this year, according to the association, which represents over 20,000
apparel
makers and retailers in the segment.
""There was an upswing in sales after lockdowns after consumers rushed to malls and stores but that has normalised now. We see large branded and organised chains performing well despite price increases but a large chunk of smaller retailers and apparel makers operating out of multi-brand outlets in smaller towns are feeling the pressure due to inflation,"" Rahul Mehta, chief mentor at CMAI said ahead of fabrics, accessories and beyond (FAB) show that generated about Rs2400 crore in business in the previous years.
Historically, the clothing segment grew 10-12% but volumes drove a bulk of sales. With a nearly 50% increase in cotton yarn prices since the past two years, most of the apparel makers and retailers hiked prices by 15-20%. This resulted in falling demand especially in smaller towns for unorganised players.

""We have not seen de-growth in volume, but it has not grown as much as the value. Last year, we had to take a price hike because of an increase in cotton prices but it was absorbed well by the consumers. However, there is a bit of stress and it is evident in the shopping behaviour,"" said Devarajan Iyer, CEO of fashion retailer
Lifestyle International
.
There is also a shift to branded apparel market, which now accounts for 30% of the segment compared to 25% nearly five years ago. The Rs 8 lakh crore apparel retail sector in India has grown broadly in line with nominal GDP over the years and analysts expect this trend to continue in the next decade. The organised part, however, clocked a higher growth of 18% as incomes rose and consumers shifted steadily towards organised formats.
""Fashion and lifestyle business continues to grow pretty strongly. We continue to improve our average bill values and conversion rates as our price value proposition in this space is very very strong as you are aware of, there's a share of our own brands in our offline business,"" Dinesh Taluja, chief financial officer at
Reliance Retail
, said at an investor call on Friday.
Share of e-commerce is amongst the highest in the apparel sector globally, as well as in India, though it is still significantly below countries like China and the US.
""Our global case study indicates that brand-cum-retailers such as H&M,
Inditex and Uniqlo
have been able to increase their online salience. Companies in India have also been investing behind omni-channel capabilities over the years, to gain a foothold in this channel. Companies with strong brands such as Page, ABFRL,
Trent
, among others, are better placed to use e-commerce as a lever to accelerate growth,"" said a recent report by IIFL.

Going ahead, the government plans to exempt diapers and sanitary napkins from the ambit of QCOs and allow self-help groups to products them as these are mass consumption items with multiple small players manufacturing these products.

UP government reintroduces popular flat rate for electricity scheme for weavers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/garments-/-textiles/up-government-reintroduces-popular-flat-rate-for-electricity-scheme-for-weavers/articleshow/99375874.cms,10-04-2023,"The UP cabinet has passed an amended version of a popular 2006 flat rate subsidy measure for electricity used by powerloom weavers in UP after doing away with it in 2019 in what is a significant step to assuage woes of the weaving community- a significant voting bloc in Purvanchal- ahead of 2024 polls, and also ties with the party's Pasmanda Muslim outreach as most weavers are backward Muslims.
However, the revised rates and conditions have not gone down too well with a section of the community.
The
flat rate subsidy scheme
started in 2006 under the
Mulayam
Singh government has been cited by weavers as a key measure that kept them afloat. Under it, weavers with any level of connections were required to pay a flat rate of Rs 130 every month for looms using 1 HP of energy in urban areas and half of it for 0.5 HP loom. In 2019, the
Yogi Adityanath
government made unit-based billing mandatory which could have risen their monthly expenditure on power to Rs 3000. After weavers protested, the new rule was put on hold and multiple meetings were held with weaver representatives to understand their concerns. The uncertainty regarding it however kept the community on tenterhooks. The state has about 2.5 lakh powerloom machines through which about 5.5 lakh weavers- concentrated mostly in east UP districts of Varanasi, Mau and others, earn their livelihood. In 2022 state polls,
BJP
had performed underwhelmingly in many districts of
Purvanchal
.
Now, the government has finally announced reinstating the measure on Tuesday, renaming the scheme as
Atal Bihari
Vajpayee Powerloom Weaver Electricity Flat Rate Scheme which will be brought into effect from April, 2023, albeit with increased rates. Additionally, all past dues up till March 31, 2023 will be paid according to 2006 rates- a big relief for weavers.
There are 86,000 powerloom connections in the state out of which 73,588 are of 5KW or less. For connections up to 5 KW, in urban areas, where most powerloom connections are- a weaver will now have to pay Rs 800 for a 1 HP machine and half of it for a 0.5 HP one. In rural areas, the rate is kept at Rs 600 and Rs 300 for the categories. For those with connections higher than 5KW, the government will pay Rs 700 per HP to a maximum of Rs 9100, and the remaining will have to be borne by the weavers.

""We had been promised that the increase in the rate will be reasonable but the new rates are too high and will be difficult to pass on to our products as there is competition too among weavers across the country. Besides, the condition of up to 5 KW is also worrisome. We had demanded Rs 200 per HP for all categories of connections.

The Centre envisages an investment of nearly Rs 70,000 crores into these parks, with employment generation for about 20 lakh people, India's Textiles Minister Piyush Goyal said.
The parks will function as centres of opportunity to create an integrated textiles value chain, right from spinning, weaving, processing, dyeing and printing to garment manufacturing, all at a single location, reported The Hindu.
""The textile industry has been unorganised in the country. This increased wastage and logistical costs impacted the competitiveness of the country's textile sector. This cluster-based approach, a vision of the Prime Minister, will solve several problems of the sector,"" Goyal said.
He added that environmental clearances would also be eased under the scheme.
Textiles Secretary Rachna Shah said that the Ministry had selected the locations for the parks in a transparent manner, having considered 18 proposals from 13 states.
The eligibility of the states and sites was evaluated using a transparent challenge. It was based on objective criteria, taking into account a variety of factors such as connectivity, the existing ecosystem, textiles, industry policy, infrastructure, utility services, etc.
PM Gati Shakti- National Master Plan for Multi-modal Connectivity--was also used for validation, reported PM MITRA Parks represents a distinctive model in which the Central and State Governments will collaborate to boost investment, foster innovation, create job opportunities, and eventually turn India into a major hub for textile production and exports.
Through these parks, an expenditure of almost 70,000 crores of rupees and the creation of 20 lakh jobs are anticipated.
""An SPV [Special Purpose Vehicle] owned by Centre and State Government will be set up for each park which will oversee the implementation of the project.
The
Ministry of Textiles
will provide financial support in the form of Development Capital Support upto Rs 500 crore per park to the Park SPV,"" the Ministry said. A Competitive Incentive Support (CIS) of up to Rs 300 crore per park to the units in PM MITRA Park shall also be provided to incentivise speedy implementation. Convergence with other
Government of India
schemes shall also be facilitated in order to ensure additional incentives to the Master
Developer and investor units"" added the statement.
Goyal said that State governments have offered to provide at least 1,000 acres of land for free for the parks and will also facilitate the provision of all utilities such as power and water. He said that Rs200 crores have been allotted as an initial investment.
""Different elements to make all the approvals easier will be considered. We will encourage the use of renewable energy in a big way in these parks,"" Goyal said, adding that the parks would offer excellent infrastructure, plug-and-play facilities as well as training and research facilities for the industry, reported The Hindu.
