"In tense relations with India, Pakistani TV dramas break down barriers that diplomacy often cannot",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/in-tense-relations-with-india-pakistani-tv-dramas-break-down-barriers-that-diplomacy-often-cannot/articleshow/119703873.cms,29-03-2025,"Two Pakistani women sit together on a couch, rehearsing their lines while a director scrutinizes them. Waiting off camera for his scene is the male lead, an actor blessed with ""Bachelor"" hair and fine bone structure.
Also out of sight: the Islamabad homeowners, who are holed up in a separate room and whose furniture and knick-knacks will be seen by millions of viewers - many from the society that has been their country's neighbor and uneasy sparring partner for much of the past century.
This is the set of the
Pakistani drama
""Adhi Bewafai,"" or ""Half Infidelity"" - one of what some in other nations would call ""soap operas."" But these dramas, it turns out, are not just for Pakistanis.
Realistic settings, natural dialogue and almost workaday plots about families and marriages make Pakistani dramas a hit with viewers at home and abroad - especially in the neighboring country that split with
Pakistan
in 1947 and is its nuclear archrival today: India.
Television, it seems, is succeeding where diplomacy sometimes can't.

A glimpse into life across the border
Several thousand people work in Pakistan's drama industry; the country produces between 80 to 120 shows a year, each one a source of escapism and intrigue. They offer Indians a tantalizing glimpse into life across the border - and manage to break through decades of enmity between the two governments.
Maheen Shafeeq, a research associate at the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad, says there is effectively no relationship between the two governments. Each government is fixed on a single issue it cannot move past - for India, it's terrorism; for Pakistan, the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir. ""The governments are very much opposed to each other,"" she says. ""They don't agree what they should talk about.""
Although it's difficult for Indians to visit Pakistan, where these shows are filmed, they faithfully follow the plot twists and turns through platforms like YouTube,
ZEE5
, and MX Player.
For those of a certain generation, however, it wasn't always so easy to keep up.
Kaveri Mishra, a writer in the Indian city of Patna, recalls her mother-in-law and aunt jiggling antennas in the 1980s and 1990s in hopes of catching a signal from Pakistan's state broadcaster, PTV. It's how Mishra first realized that the country next door was a drama powerhouse. It inspired her to discover the shows for herself years later, even going on to watch them with her own daughter.
""They feel familiar, but they are also a break from our own lives,"" Mishra says. ""I don't see any differences between the two countries. Everything is relatable. I see Karachi and think that it could be Lucknow or Patna. What happens on the shows could happen to me or my friends.""
She had heard only negative things about Pakistan since childhood - that it was the enemy that would take everything from India. The TV dramas have added subtlety and detail to this image for her. She would love to visit, but is unlikely to get the opportunity. So she explores Pakistan through the locations, malls, offices, streets and restaurants depicted on the small screen. The names of popular Karachi neighborhoods roll off her tongue.
Mishra, like Bibi Hafeez in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad and Punita Kumar in the central Indian city of Raipur, raves about the dramas' universality of themes, the strong characterization and the emotional range.
""Pakistani characters are not only heroes or villains. They have shades to them, and that is very human,"" says Kumar, who chanced upon a Pakistani drama through a chunky videocassette when she was a teenager living in the northern Indian city of Aligarh. It was love at first watch.
""They captivated me. We got a cable connection that offered PTV. Then YouTube came and I realized I could search for whatever drama I wanted. I haven't taken a stop,"" she said. ""We get exposure to Pakistani life in the scenes, but the struggles the characters have with their relatives are ones I would have with my own.""
Pakistani TV veteran Khaled Anam is delighted by Indians' enthusiasm for the country's serials and the barriers they help erode.
""What Bollywood is to India, dramas are to Pakistan,"" says Anam, who is based in Karachi and has worked as an actor since the 1980s. He has appeared in many dramas, including the ratings smash ""Humsafar"" (""Life Partner"").
India's productions go big, while Pakistan's are more low key  India dominates the movie market in South Asia and beyond, with big stars and bigger budgets. Pakistanis have been exposed to Bollywood films for decades, although the prevailing hostile political climate means they can't watch them in movie theaters. The bans are mutual, though. India, like Pakistan, restricts content from across the border in movie theaters and TV channels.
And while India is no slouch when it comes to TV production, it doesn't offer viewers what Pakistan does, according to Anam: simplicity, depth of writing and a limited number of episodes.
""There are 15-minute flashbacks in Indian serials. (The characters) are decked out and dolled up. It's a fantasy world. The shows go on forever. Everything is 'DUN dun dun!'"" says Anam, mimicking a dramatic musical riff and shaking his hands.
The actors on the couch in Islamabad are rehearsing lines about a woman who is disrespectful and so, according to one of them, is an unsuitable marriage prospect. The delivery and grammar could be heard in virtually any South Asian household.
""Pakistanis are generally emotional people, and that is in their dramas also,"" says Islamabad-based director Saife Hassan. ""It would take me less than two minutes to explain the plot of the super-duper hit 'Kabhi Main, Kabhi Tum' ('Sometimes Me, Sometimes You'). It's about the emotions between a husband and wife.""
Hassan, who began his TV career in the 1990s, says Indians frequently comment on his social media pages and send him direct messages about his work. He even recalls Indian viewers praying for the recovery of a character who was in a coma.
Hassan would love to see more homegrown dramas make it onto platforms like
Netflix
, as some Indian shows have with great success. But he wonders whether international audiences would understand and connect with Pakistani stories or lives: ""The way we think is different from the West. Our shows are not driven by events. They are driven by emotions.""
There is also a lack of raunch in Pakistani dramas, which are family-friendly with little to no vulgarity, violence, or even action. Indians, therefore, are a natural audience for Pakistani dramas, Hassan says.
""They are our people. They are like us. They eat like us,"" he says. ""I love India, and I love Indians. They have grown out of this animosity.""

Digital to contribute about half of India's media-entertainment sector revenue by 2027: FICCI-EY report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/digital-to-contribute-about-half-of-indias-media-entertainment-sector-revenue-by-2027-ficci-ey-report/articleshow/119697682.cms,29-03-2025,"New media space in India is growing by leaps and bounds, with an ever-increasing rise in internet penetration supported by the affordability and aspiration of its citizens.
According to a joint report by industry body FICCI consultancy services firm EY, by 2027, new media (digital as well as online gaming) will comprise 46 per cent of media and entertainment sector revenue, while traditional media (TV, print, film, radio, and Out-of-Home (OOH) will contribute 41 per cent of total of the sector's revenues.
In another projection, the joint report said that advertising will comprise 52 per cent (from 51 per cent in 2024) of total sector revenues in 2027, while the share of subscription will reduce to 35 per cent by 2027 (from 39 per cent in 2024).
The Indian media and entertainment sector is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent and add Rs 564 billion in three years through 2027, the FICCI-EY report said.
""New media will provide 68 per cent of this growth, followed by live events (12 per cent) and animation and VFX (8 per cent),"" it added.
Live Events
""Barring unforeseen situations, we expect all segments to grow or remain flat, except linear television, so long as India's real GDP grows 5 per cent or more,"" it noted.
As news consumption shifts to online video and text, and as the youth consume news on social and other platforms, news media will need to rethink their content, monetization, and measurement strategies, it suggested.
""Content will need to be created multi-format and multimedia, and separately for younger audiences and for different segments,"" it supplemented.
Amidst the rapid emergence in new media, the report asserted that broadcasters will reinvest in making linear television more competitive.
Digital media overtook television to become the largest segment, contributing 32 per cent of media industry revenues in 2024, according to the report by FICCI and EY.
The report stated that for the first time, digital media has overtaken television to become the largest segment in India's Media and Entertainment (M&E) sector. The rapid growth of digital media continues, with projections indicating an 11.2 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2024 and 2027.
The report said, ""Digital media overtook television for the first time to become the largest segment"".
In contrast, television, which once dominated the sector, is facing a decline. It registered negative growth of -0.6 per cent during the same period, highlighting the shifting preferences of audiences toward online platforms.
New media (comprising digital media and online gaming) grew to Rs 113 billion (12 per cent) and now comprise 41 per cent of the M&E sector's revenues.
Core traditional media (television, print, radio and music) together saw their revenues drop by (-)3 per cent or Rs 30 billion, and their share of the total M&E sector fell to 41 per cent.
Overall, the Indian M&E sector grew by 3.3 per cent in 2024, adding Rs 81 billion to reach a total value of Rs 2.5 trillion (USD29.4 billion). The industry now contributes 0.73 per cent to India's GDP and has grown 30 per cent above its pre-pandemic 2019 levels.

"Anora (2025), Pretty Woman (1990), Oscars and the confirmed rise of an audience which does not value intense or intimate experiences in films",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/anora-2025-pretty-woman-1990-oscars-and-the-confirmed-rise-of-an-audience-which-does-not-value-intense-or-intimate-experiences-in-films/articleshow/119382729.cms,23-03-2025,"Beyond the highly debatable selection of the film
Anora
(2024) in key and multiple categories at the 97th Academy Awards, there lies an irrefutable fact. It is the noteworthy commercial success of Anora (2024) globally. The film was made on a budget of $6 million. Even before it won multiple Oscars, the film had collected $46 million worldwide in theatres. Multiple
Oscars
merely boosted its collection by an additional $6 million, taking its total collection in theatres globally to $52.5 million. This means that even before the film won awards in key categories at the 97th Academy Awards, it had emerged as a bona fide success by earning more than seven times its budget, globally.
This noteworthy success of the film in theatres globally confirms a sustained trend in cinema which has become almost a global phenomenon: The trend of an increasing base of an audience which does not value ‘intimate’ or ‘intense’ experiences in films. For this audience, ‘understanding’ a film is a barometer sufficient to pronounce a verdict about the film. In this way, this audience has reduced the whole journey of watching a film to an ‘intellectual exercise’ rather than an ‘experience’, which is the vital criterion in evaluating a film’s worthiness.
This aspect is amply reflected in the film Anora (2024). The film is about a sex worker (named Anora, played by
Mikey Madison
) who harbours unrealistic expectations from a spoilt and hedonistic son (named Vanya, played by
Mark Eydelshteyn
) of a rich and influential Russian family. In an on-spur-of-the-moment decision, they get married. Harsh realities emerge. The might of the rich Russian family prevails. Anora is forced to divorce Vanya. And Vanya who has ulterior motives behind the marriage deserts Anora.
This plot has borrowed certain core elements from the film
Pretty Woman
(1990). The only obvious and prime difference is Anora (2024) does not have the fairy tale ending of Pretty Woman (1990). But what Anora (2024) falls short of is achieved in Pretty Woman (1990) considerably and successfully: An Emotional Depth and Experience.
The story of Anora lacks sufficient emotional moments which fail to trigger neither sympathy nor empathy for her in a viewer. This is because there is very little in her character which makes one sympathetic or empathetic towards her. If a viewer feels sympathetic or empathetic towards her then the genesis of sympathy or empathy is connected to her identity as a sex worker and not to her personality. This sympathy or empathy is likely to be more of an ‘intellectual exercise” as Anora could be seen through the template of stories of sex workers available through films and real-life.
Live Events
In the film, Anora comes across as a professional who has accepted prostitution as a means to make a living. She faces challenges and discrimination like most sex workers. In fact, like most sex workers she is considered to be a pleasure-providing machine. But she has passed the phase of being naïve and idealistic about these unpleasant truths. Though she may have a murky and problematic past, her demeanour lacks the essential thing which makes a viewer root for women like her: Emotional Vulnerability.
In Pretty Woman (1990),
Vivian
(played by
Julia Roberts
) is a woman of certain principles. Though she is a sex worker, she has not lost a certain degree of heart-melting charm, endearing naivety and an otherworldliness which goes beyond the trappings of a hedonist mind. She acknowledges the humanness of a person. She wants others also to acknowledge her humanness which goes beyond her identity as a sex worker. This is fairly evident in her no-kiss principle with her clients. She knows that a kiss is a special expression of love whose foundation is not ephemeral and dehumanising carnal desires but a calming force which transcends deep subjectivity and acknowledges the bare humanness in a person. She is more like a lotus in a muddy water. This aspect in her affects a viewer.
Anora, on the other hand, triggers and appeals to those darker aspects of human consciousness which rob an individual of peace, clarity and strength required to live a meaningful life. When Vanya calls her at his mansion, she is more than willing to offer her. There is not a moment in the film which shows that she is looking for an emotional connection or a conversation which goes beyond the confines of dehumanising sex. In fact, there are contradicting elements in her which are striking in nature. If one considers Anora a more practical and clinical version of Vivian of Pretty Woman (1990), then how come she pins hope of a long and enduring marriage to a spoiled brat (Vanya) whose sole interest in her is restricted only to her body and his pleasure.
There is not a single moment in the film which shows that Vanya is interested in her as a person. He is not interested in knowing her likes and dislikes and her worldview in general. This behaviour does not irk, bother, upset or hurt her. In fact, as a viewer one is faced with a key question: Where are the moments in the film which lead to the formation of a bond between Anora and Vanya? Their engagement (not relationship) hardly transcends the carnal plane. Anora is so focused on seeking his family’s approval to the marriage and legally establishing the marriage that she forgets that between the family and the law it is Vanya’s heart which will save her marriage. There are hardly any moments which indicate that they are mildly interested in knowing each other.
There is a certain degree of entitlement in the way Anora behaves. Does she think that the bitterness triggered in her by the injustices of the world warrant this kind of behaviour? She knows that the marriage could be her last chance at escaping from the dehumanising life of a sex worker. What is worth noting is Anora is not even shocked when Vanya runs away after the henchmen arrive at the mansion. She looks shattered. One wonders: what shatters her more: the deserting of Vanya? or Her inability and incapacity to establish her legal marriage to the henchmen in the absence of Vanya? This triggers a thought in a sensitive viewer: Is Anora more interested in the wealth and luxuries the marriage with Vanya can provide?
A viewer hardly feels any presence of trust and love between them. Can debauchery and hedonism make up for tender moments which establish a bond between a man and a woman? In fact, a sensitive viewer is compelled to think whether “betrayal” is the right understanding of Anora’s plight when Vanya deserts her.
In a sharp contrast to this, there is a heart-touching chemistry between Edward (played by
Richard Gere
) and Vivian in Pretty Woman (1990). There are moments in the film which show how they both improve and make each other better in life-altering ways. Vivian teaches Edward that happiness lies in small moments and not in grand adventures of life. She feels his sensitive and protective side. She falls for his openness to admit his mistakes and willingness to show, feel and express his sensitive side to her. He moulds her and that moulding is nothing but shaping and polishing what is already dormant in Vivian. She teaches him life. There is an interesting piece of wisdom she unknowingly throws at him: So, you don’t build or make anything? This thought changes his whole approach to his life. She makes him a beacon of optimism as he wants to build businesses rather than splitting and selling businesses in parts. In fact, he goes to the extent of telling Vivian that he will never treat her like a prostitute.
The film’s closing dialogue itself encapsulates what they end up achieving in their relationship. Edward asks her: What happens after the knight rescues her? She replies: “She rescues him right back”. In these moments, their relationship blossoms and acquires a certain emotional depth. These moments show that the relationship between them is mutually benefiting and not parasitic and opportunistic in nature. The journey of Vivian’s character is so emotionally fascinating that it makes a viewer believe that even if Edward would not have proposed to her, Vivian would have become something or done something in her life. Vivian’s positivity is so infectious that her friend leaves prostitution and ventures into beauty business.
These positive and emotional elements are starkly missing in Anora (2024). Oddly enough, the glaring lack of emotional moments in Anora (2024) has not bothered its audience which has made the film a thumping success in theatres globally. Perhaps, this audience relied more on their intellectual understanding of the plight of sex workers rather than the film’s capacity to provide a highly emotional experience. This has been a rising trend across film industries in which such audiences engage in “meaning making” of a film rather than valuing “emotional experience” of the film.
But when a film offers a highly emotional experience in an overpowering manner and affects an audience emotionally, the film receives more love than the film which works on an intellectual level and fails to provide a strong emotional experience. A case in the point is the extraordinary box office success of the studio-backed Pretty Woman (1990). On a budget of $14 million, the film collected $463 million in theatres globally, fetching 33 times the money invested in the film.

"India gaming market to be more sizable, impactful; looking to invest, acquire: KRAFTON India CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/india-gaming-market-to-be-more-sizable-impactful-looking-to-invest-acquire-krafton-india-ceo/articleshow/119376043.cms,23-03-2025,"South Korean gaming giant
KRAFTON
-- the name behind popular esports title
Battlegrounds Mobile India
(BGMI) -- is actively looking to invest and acquire in India, which is among its top five markets globally and where mobile-first gaming culture, rapid smartphone adoption, and a young, tech-savvy population are driving prospects of steady growth in online gaming. KRAFTON India CEO, Sean Hyunil Sohn sees the gaming industry here becoming much more sizable and impactful, and asserts the company would not be tied down to fixed investment limits for this ""promising"" market. KRAFTON has already invested USD 200 million in the country.
Reflecting on India's regulatory landscape and past challenges faced by KRAFTON, he highlighted the company's positive outlook on regulations.
Sean said India's approach to norms are supported by defined processes, constructive feedback, and a calibrated approach before actual implementation of guidelines.
""We want to double down on gaming and its addressable area because we believe now it is time for the gaming industry to become much more sizable and impactful. And we see a much bigger potential for the next 2-3 years,"" he told PTI.
Although the company does not disclose country-specific revenue separately, India -- in terms of revenue and user base -- is among the top-five countries for KRAFTON, he said.
Live Events
Further, steady growth projections for the Indian economy and increasing adoption of smartphones are driving a positive outlook for the company.
Despite the growing popularity of gaming and esports, the Indian market is still relatively small when compared globally.
""In terms of size or in terms of development stage, as an industry, I think it is still early or relatively small compared to the global gaming markets. But I think India has a very unique position because India is a mobile gaming native country. So other countries that are in more mature stages, have gone through (the path of) consoles, PCs, and mobiles now. But in India, gamers started with playing games from mobile, that is a very unique difference,"" he said, adding that the potential of the industry is ""very promising"".
The demographics metrics, too, plays out in favour of the industry.
India has a relatively large, dynamic, younger population, compared to some of the mature gaming markets.
""And then we have one of the most popular game in the country, which is still steadily growing in terms of user base, and in terms of revenue. So I think India market has been very attractive for us to build our presence and invest more,"" he said.
The company has been investing in gaming, digital entertainment, and other tech sectors in the country.
""KRAFTON has had a great financial year in 2024. So I think we have more capacity to invest in India, which is one of top performing markets for the company. We will not stop investing... say at USD 200-300 million. We have invested USD 200 million so far, but I think we are still actively looking at opportunities to invest and maybe acquire, if there is an attractive company to acquire and work with. We are very active,"" he said.
KRAFTON, despite its position as a global game publisher, still has the mindset of game developers at its core, according to the company.
""Of course, we are now global game publishers so we have a wide publishing capacity around the globe. We want to partner with someone who is really passionate about game development and working for the gaming industry. That is the number one criteria if we want to acquire someone in the gaming industry,"" he said, adding that those making the cut would also need to be ""positive and passionate"" about the potential of the Indian gaming industry.
He said India has the strength and the capacity to create games for the global markets.
""I think there is a lot of potential for talent which can tap into the industry, but most people are not aware that gaming is a very serious career opportunity. We can do a lot of things as an industry player... we need support from the government and education institutions to put the best talent out for the younger generation to come to the gaming industry and make a long-term bet on the industry,"" he said.

"A brand new high, under the influence of content creators",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/a-brand-new-high-under-the-influence-of-content-creators/articleshow/119353042.cms,23-03-2025,"Digital creators
are no longer just brand endorsers; they are becoming advisors, helping brands craft compelling narratives and engagement strategies.
“Creators are increasingly teaching brands how to build effective social strategies,” said Ayush Guha, business head at Hypp, a creator management agency. “It’s becoming one of the most lucrative opportunities in the
creator economy
, accessible to both established and emerging talent.”
Guha cites the example of an Instagram influencer who does this regularly for large platforms, including a streaming giant. These consulting opportunities aren’t limited to mainstream influencers. Guha notes that niche creators with fewer than 200,000 followers are finding success with emerging
D2C brands
in retail and the food sector, commanding monthly fee ranging from Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh for social media and content strategy.
The trend reflects a shift in how brands perceive creator value.
Lakshmi Balasubramanian, CEO of Greenroom Network, an
influencer marketing
agency, notes that creator consultancy has grown, with brands recognising creators’ natural strengths in storytelling, viral
content creation
, and cultural fluency. “Creators are recognised for their skills that extend beyond being influencers alone,” she said. “They are good writers, understand a particular category very well and audience needs, so they are best fits for some of these roles.”
Live Events
Balasubramanian points to two D2C beauty brands in her network that have enlisted skincare influencers not for traditional endorsements but as dedicated content consultants shaping brand messaging and strategy.
Some creators are leveraging their digital portfolios to secure full-time corporate positions. Civil engineer Ripudaman Singh, 23, began reviewing tech products on X and Facebook in 2020. By 2024, his content caught the attention of ergonomic solutions company Frido, resulting in a full-time role as a product marketing specialist. “Content creators have a deep understanding of storytelling, audience engagement, and brand positioning, skills that are incredibly valuable in today’s digital landscape,” said Ganesh Sonawane, CEO of D2C brand Frido.
“When we hire a creator, we’re bringing in someone who knows how to build influence, craft narratives, and resonate with people,” according to Sonawane. The Frido CEO has made three such hires, including that of 33-year-old Ami Palan as a senior brand manager. Among the biggest successes has been Tanmay Bhat who, with his content studio Moonshot, has worked with top consumer brands like Cred, Subway and Meesho among others on ad campaigns.
The trajectory works in reverse as well. Marketing executive Aarti Samant has doubled business for her consulting firm Sorted Digital by showcasing her marketing expertise through Instagram handle @thesortedgirl, which boasts 240,000 followers. “There are numerous consultancy firms and agencies out there, but clients come to me because they see that I’m practicing what I preach. I’m not just theorising — I’m demonstrating how to create content and using those same hooks in my own work,” she said.
The same principle applies to successful creators consulting with brands. “When you create content yourself, you become incredibly attuned to audience feedback — understanding why certain scripts or reels work while others don’t,” she said. “This intuitive knowledge is something I can now apply to the brands we consult for and teach to my team.” Samant is now specifically recruiting marketers with content creation experience, believing that firsthand platform fluency translates directly to more effective client work.
In an industry where creators still depend heavily on brand deals for income stability, these strategic roles represent a promising evolution, though industry observers note the trend remains emerging rather than mainstream.
For creators themselves, the shift offers a potential answer to ongoing income challenges. “One of the biggest hurdles is the lack of consistent income since most work is freelance-based. As a beginner, it’s especially tough to sustain yourself financially. Having a stable job has been essential to support my content creation journey on the side,” said Singh, who now works at Frido.

"Regional OTT platform STAGE secures $12.5 million funding led by Goodwater Capital, Blume Ventures",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/regional-ott-platform-stage-secures-12-5-million-funding-led-by-goodwater-capital-blume-ventures/articleshow/119302410.cms,21-03-2025,"STAGE, an OTT platform dedicated to regional cultures, has closed a $12.5 million Series B funding round, led by Goodwater Capital and Blume Ventures, with participation from Physis Capital and prominent angel investors.
Focusing on underserved languages and cultures, STAGE has emerged as India’s fastest-growing regional OTT platform, recording ₹180 crore in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), 4.4 million paying households, and over 20 million app installs across various app stores.
Since its inception, STAGE has redefined regional entertainment, fostering a thriving content ecosystem for Haryanvi, Rajasthani, and now Bhojpuri audiences. Over the past year alone, the platform has seen a remarkable 289% surge in revenue and a 286% increase in subscribers, driven by originals such as
Videshi Bahu
(Haryanvi), Kaand 2010 (Haryanvi), and Bhawani (Rajasthani), alongside the National Award-winning Dada Lakhmi, featuring Bollywood veteran
Yashpal Sharma
.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vinay Singhal, CEO & Co-Founder of STAGE, remarked: “This funding isn’t just about capital — it’s a resounding validation of India’s regional cultures. For too long, dialects like Haryanvi or Bhojpuri have been seen as a liability. We’re proving otherwise. When Gen-Z users rediscover their cultural identity through constructive storytelling on STAGE, it fosters pride, not stigma. This is the revolution we’re building silently.”
Harsh Mani Tripathi, Chief Product Officer & Co-Founder, echoed this sentiment: “Our growth isn’t accidental. Every subscriber who joins STAGE isn’t just a user — they’re custodians of their culture.”
Live Events
Backing this vision, Dr Ritesh Malik, Board Member of STAGE and Founder of Innov8 & Palaksha University, stated: ""STAGE is rewriting India’s entertainment landscape. By amplifying underrepresented voices, empowering local creators, and making regional dialects aspirational, STAGE is not just shaping content—it’s shaping culture.”
With Bhojpuri content now live, STAGE’s roadmap for 2025-26 is prioritising expansion into new cultures while deepening its impact within existing ones.
Shashank Vaishnav, CTO & Co-Founder, affirmed: “This capital enables us to scale India’s only multi-regional content movement — one that’s rooted in constructive storytelling and cultural pride.”
Reflecting on STAGE’s journey, Karthik Reddy, Partner at Blume, said, “When we first met STAGE, we saw a mission to preserve local culture and language and create a sense of pride, identity, and employment within those regions. It was a free Haryanvi app waiting to take the first step towards subscription. To see it bloom to ₹15 crore a month when sceptics said no one would pay or watch this as primary content, is very satisfying. Onto breaking more barriers, strengthening more cultures.”

Silicon Valley continues to be the epicentre of innovation, as demonstrated at a recent pitch session hosted by Tim Draper, Founder of Draper Associates. The event featured a diverse lineup of startups offering groundbreaking solutions across multiple industries. With seasoned judges Andy Tang and Maxime Bucaille evaluating the pitches, the winner had to make a special effort to navigate the fierce competition.
Leo Trottier and Alexis Devine, the founders of FluentPet, presented their vision of enabling interspecies communication. Their technology allows pets to express themselves using a specially designed system. With over 100,000 units sold and $6 million in revenue, FluentPet has captured the interest of pet owners worldwide. While judges acknowledged its novelty and strong brand potential, they raised concerns about competition and the challenge of creating a defensible market position.
Mini Suri, the co-founder of Velmeni, highlighted the alarming statistic that 30% of cavities and oral conditions go undetected. Using AI-driven diagnostics, Velmeni aims to enhance early intervention in oral health, potentially preventing serious medical conditions. With key advisors like Dr. Ed Zuckerberg, the startup has credibility, but the judges questioned whether it could compete with established hardware manufacturers and suggested exploring home-based applications.
PropTexx, founded by Stefan Gunnarsson and Joshua Lamerton, introduced an AI-powered platform that enhances property searches with semantic chat and real-time image customisation features. Their partnership with Home Depot enables users to furnish homes virtually, creating an engaging buying experience. While the judges acknowledged its potential, they urged the team to explore data-driven monetisation opportunities and new business models.
Amit Sinha, founder and CEO of Basepair, presented a data analysis platform designed to simplify genomic research for scientists. By eliminating the need for coding, Basepair accelerates discoveries in medicine. Judges recognised its vast market potential but emphasised the need for greater integration across hardware platforms to enhance its scalability.
Tim Draper declared Basepair the winner, acknowledging its transformative impact on genomic research. While all the startups demonstrated exceptional promise, Basepair stood out for its ability to tackle one of the most significant bottlenecks in medical science.
As Silicon Valley continues to evolve, these startups exemplify the relentless pursuit of innovation. Whether in AI-driven healthcare, real estate, or interspecies communication, the next wave of tech-driven disruption is already here.

From Arijit Singh to Anirudh Ravichander: Indian artists' royalty income soars as Spotify makes big payouts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/from-arijit-singh-to-anirudh-ravichander-indian-artists-royalty-income-soars-as-spotify-makes-big-payouts/articleshow/119150989.cms,18-03-2025,"Indian musicians and artists have made it big, globally: From Diljit Dosanjh to
Arijit Singh
or even Telugu artist Anirudh Ravichander, their royalties have grown multifold, according to a Spotify report. Moreover, the music streaming platform said over 90% of the tracks that were featured on
Spotify India
’s daily top 50 playlist in 2024 were by local artists, which is a 6% increase from 2023.
Not just that, royalties generated by Indian artists performing in Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu have each more than doubled since 2021. Moreover, Indian artists gained big from Spotify’s global reach, with over 65% of the top 30 most exported songs coming from beyond the film industry.
Spotify's latest report titled 'Loud & Clear' said that in 2024 alone, Indian artists were discovered over 11.2 billion times by first-time listeners, a 13% increase from 2023.
A closer look at the numbers reveals a thriving ecosystem for Indian musicians. As per the report, the number of Indian artists earning over Rs 50 lakh in royalties from Spotify has more than doubled since 2022, while those generating over Rs 1 crore have tripled.
Even more impressive, the count of artists earning over Rs 5 crore has also doubled. In 2024, approximately two-thirds of the royalties generated in India were attributed to Indian artists, marking a major evolution in India's music scene and artists' economy.
Live Events
Remarkably, close to 50% of all royalties generated by Indian artists on Spotify in 2024 came from listeners outside of India, a rise from 40% in 2023. Countries such as the USA, UK, UAE, Pakistan, Canada, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka have emerged as key markets for Indian music, highlighting the growing global appeal of Indian languages.
Vocal for regional?
Moreover, the diversity of languages and genres within the Indian music scene has played a pivotal role in this growth. This, too, was evident when tickets for Punjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh's concert went sold out in seconds.
But, a twist in the tale is that royalties from music performed in Telugu have skyrocketed, witnessing a 39% year-on-year increase in popularity in 2024.
Genres like Hindi pop, Hindi hip hop, Punjabi hip hop, and Tamil pop continue to lead the charge, with artists like Arijit Singh, Pritam, Anirudh Ravichander, and Shreya Ghoshal becoming household names not just in India but across the globe. Other big emerging names, who have contributed to the surge, include Karan Aujla, Diljit Dosanjh, Hanumankind, Kalmi, A.R. Rahman, Sidhu Moose Wala, Amitabh Bhattacharya, Vishal-Shekhar, AP Dhillon, Badshah, and Alka Yagnik.
Over 9,000 Indian artists were added to global and local editorial playlists in 2024, up from 8,700 the prior year, indicative of Indian music and its dominance.
On a global scale, Spotify said that it has continued to set the pace in the music industry, distributing more than $10 billion in music royalties in 2024 alone.
This represents a tenfold increase in payouts over the past decade, with the total sum paid out since the platform's inception reaching around $60 billion.

Telecom companies
across the world are using their mobile apps as a platform for
esports
enthusiasts to earn lucrative rewards such as Amazon vouchers, Uber rides, Swiggy coupons and data top-ups etc.
And B2B platform providers like
Gamerji
(India), Swamio (Canada) and Strive Cloud (Belgium) have perfected the
gaming-as-a-service
model.
For instance, Ahmedabad-based esports platform Gamerji, which offers titles such as FIFA, Valorant, Call of Duty, Pokemon Unite etc., has partnered with 34 telecom companies globally to integrate these games within the telco apps and organise cross-border tournaments.
“We have partnered with telecom companies like
Vodafone Idea
in India, Du in UAE, Mobily in Saudi Arabia and Ooredoo in Qatar and amassed over 65-70 million users,” said Sohan Thacker, founder, Gamerji, told ET.
“Users compete for virtual currency such as gold coins (and not real money) which are then rewarded by the telco through rewards like free data, bill discounts to incentivize gaming through their apps. Gamerji's AI technology matches players of similar skill levels, enhancing gameplay experience and skill-building,” he said.
Live Events
Thacker recalled that initially it was hard to convince telecom companies that users would do anything else on the telco app other than recharging. However, today 37% of Gamerji's revenues are driven solely from the B2B telecom segment.
The MyVI app witnesses a few thousand users per day, while foreign telcos gather 20,000-30,000 daily active users with higher spending potential per user, he said.
When asked about the challenges in growth of the model, Thacker said that different regions have data localisation requirements in gaming. “Different languages, cultural preferences and varying game popularity in different regions are also some hurdles to build scalable cross-country tournaments,” he added.
Going forward, the company aims to focus on India, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also aiming to collaborate with federations for major tournaments such as the Esports Olympics and Southeast Sports World Cup.

Why is the govt handing out $1 billion to content creators?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/why-is-the-govt-handing-out-1-billion-to-content-creators/articleshow/119110000.cms,17-03-2025,"Easier and cheaper access to the internet has been fuelling India's
creator economy
with lakhs of people, especially the youth, creating content on
social media
channels such as YouTube. A few days ago, Union information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced a $1 billion fund for the creator economy following a high-level session on the
World Audio-Visual and Entertainment Summit
(WAVES) 2025. The fund is expected to be structured as a public-private partnership (PPP), with details of government contributions and private-sector involvement to be released soon.
Alongside the $1 billion fund, the government has also sanctioned Rs 391 crore for establishing the Indian Institute of Creative Technology (IICT), aimed at fostering expertise in creative and digital technologies. This institute, modeled after IITs and IIMs, will be headquartered in Mumbai’s Film City, Goregaon.
""A $1 billion fund will be created for the creator's economy which will be basically for making sure that all our energetic creators using the latest technologies today, will be able to get access to capital and hone their skills, upgrade their production levels and reach out to the global market,"" Vaishnaw said.
To take place in Mumbai from May 1 to 4, WAVES will provide the creator community with a platform to produce high-value content. The initiative aims to support digital content creators by providing access to funding, skill development, and global market opportunities. The summit is anticipated to attract participants from around 100 countries, including leading media, technology, and entertainment professionals. It will also feature discussions on the latest advancements in audiovisual technology and digital content creation. The event will also feature a creator challenge programme that has attracted over 25 lakh participants, with 80,000 submitting their content. The organisers will select the 1,000 top creators, providing a platform to recognise talent in India’s digital economy.
Why government push for content creators
Why is the government handing out such a big amount to content creators who are seen as mere social media entertainers? The answer is: while India's content creators and
social media influencers
are emerging as a mega industry as they are also becoming crucial for marketing strategies of corporates through brand partnerships, they are seen as a powerful media to build India's global soft power just as Hindi cinema has done. The emerging content industry also holds a lot of potential to create employment for a large number of youth as content makes way for business opportunities in sectors such as fashion, travel, fitness, food and finance.
Live Events
In December last year, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
said the creator economy is bringing new energy to India's efforts to become a $5 trillion economy. Mentioning how legendary actor Raj Kapoor made India a soft power through films, the PM emphasised the importance of the creator economy which can showcase India's culture and traditional knowledge to the world.
The creator economy has also dovetailed into marketing. An EY report last year pointed out the huge growth potential of India's influencer economy which is part of the larger creator economy. ""It is an opportune time for influencers in India, as 86% of them anticipate a significant increase in their income over the next two years. In addition, the emergence of short video platforms, particularly popular among users from non-metro areas, has introduced a fresh dimension to content consumption. Brands are also increasingly acknowledging the potential of the creator economy and are ramping up their investments in influencer marketing, with sectors such as FMCG, automobiles and consumer durables.""
The government also aims to make India a net exporter of content. Underlining the export potential of India's creator economy, the government has launched WAVES Bazaar in the lead-up to the World Audio Visual & Entertainment Summit (WAVES). A global e-marketplace, WAVES Bazaar is a platform designed to connect India’s vast creative talent pool with international markets. The platform enables users to showcase their content, pitch projects, and build meaningful connections that transcend geographical boundaries. It simplifies global business interactions by offering tailored tools and resources, ensuring creators and businesses can expand their reach while discovering new opportunities for growth and success.
WAVES Bazaar will unite creators, buyers and collaborators from across various entertainment sectors such as film, TV, music, esports, animation, visual effects, gaming, and comics. It will bridge geographical gaps, allowing creators to display their work and engage in meaningful B2B interactions. WAVES Bazaar will also support brand collaborations, funding and distribution, helping creators secure the backing they need to realise their ideas.
Why is India's creator economy gaining attention?
In an article published last year, Minister Vaishnaw said India’s creative economy is rapidly expanding, now valued at $30 billion, contributing nearly 2.5% to India’s GDP and providing livelihoods to 8% of the workforce. The influencer marketing sector alone is valued at Rs 3,375 crore, with over 200,000 full-time content creators contributing to India’s global presence. He said that cities such as Guwahati, Kochi and Indore are emerging as creative epicentres, fuelling a decentralized creative revolution across the country.
A recent report by Qoruz, an Influencer Marketing Intelligence Platform, has revealed the rise of the influencer ecosystem in India over the last four years. From just 962,000 influencers in 2020, the creator economy has expanded to 4.06 million influencers in 2024, reflecting a staggering 322 per cent growth. This rapid growth highlights the increasing reliance on authentic, creator-driven content as brands tap into the power of influencer-led marketing to connect with their audiences.
Gaming has been one of the fastest-growing categories, achieving a remarkable 213 per cent growth between 2020 and 2022 and reaching 467,000 influencers by the end of 2024. Travel influencers have rebounded strongly after the pandemic, showing a 212 per cent surge in 2023 and firmly establishing themselves as a critical part of the ecosystem. Parenting influencers have also shown steady growth, rising from 87,000 in 2020 to 362,000 in 2024, demonstrating the increasing demand for family-focused and relatable content. Categories such as Fashion, Beauty, and Tech have remained consistent performers, with Fashion leading the pack with 470,000 influencers by the end of 2024. The report also notes significant growth in niche categories such as Infotainment and Finance, which have rapidly gained traction. Infotainment recorded a 126 per cent growth rate, while Finance grew by 91 per cent between 2020 and 2022. By 2024, Infotainment influencers reached 203,000, and Finance grew to 232,000.
In 2025, Fashion, Arts and Entertainment, and Gaming are projected to lead in influencer numbers, with evolving audience preferences driving their growth. Fashion is expected to maintain its dominant position with 470,000 influencers, while Arts and Entertainment and Gaming are projected to reach 430,000 and 467,000 influencers, respectively. Beyond these leading categories, other segments have also shown notable growth. Health and Fitness, a category fueled by the post-pandemic focus on wellness, grew steadily, doubling its influencer base to reach 295,000 in 2024. The Food category, despite a brief decline, bounced back to end 2024 with 242,000 influencers, driven by the rise of culinary enthusiasts and at-home chefs.
Aditya Gurwara, co-founder and head of brand alliances at Qoruz, remarked, ""Over the years, we’ve seen a significant shift in how brands approach their marketing strategies. Influencers have moved beyond product endorsements to becoming strategic partners for brands. They create authentic, context-driven content that resonates deeply with audiences, making campaigns more impactful than ever before. Categories like Gaming, Travel, and Lifestyle are growing at an exceptional pace, and brands have an incredible opportunity to align with creators who truly understand their audiences.”
Influencers riding high on brands
About 12% content creators in India earn between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 10 lakh a month now, according to an EY report last year on the state of influencer marketing in India. About 86% creators expect nearly a 10% hike in income over the next two years, while 77% creators reported unspecified income growth in the last two years. Influencer marketing is expected to grow by 25% in 2024, reaching Rs 2,344 crore and rising to Rs 3,375 crore by 2026, as per the report.
Roughly 40% to 57% brands in categories like FMCG, ecommerce, and automobile are expected to increase spending on influencer marketing by 10% by 2026. Driving awareness and engagement for the brand ranked higher among influencer campaign objectives compared to lead generation and sales conversion. At present, 29% marketers are exploring performance-linked models to drive influencer accountability, the report said.
However, ""as volatile times push marketers to spend on more sure-footed channels that deliver on return on investment, brands will move away from metrics like cost per impression and engagement and link their influencer marketing initiatives with sales conversion,"" Devarajan Iyer, executive director & CEO, Lifestyle International, told ET last year. About 47% of brands preferred driving influencer campaigns with nano and micro influencers - creators with 100 to 100,000 followers - due to lower cost per reach, the report noted.
Iyer observed that large brands tend to go with mega influencers who have over a million followers. There are about 7,000 content creators falling in that category. ""Smaller brands driving new labels are more likely to use a lot of nano and micro influencers to build their brand,"" he added. About 73% content creators work for less than 10 hours a week, compared to up to 39 hours abroad, the report added, giving the impression that majority creators look at content creation as a side hustle and that perhaps only 30% are getting brand deals consistently for them to be occupied with content creation as a full-time job.

Top actors script new rules to stay 'unique' in times of AI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/top-actors-script-new-rules-to-stay-unique-in-times-of-ai/articleshow/119085070.cms,16-03-2025,"To safeguard the ""uniqueness"" of their creative contributions and ""identity"",
A-list actors
in the Indian film industry are insisting on incorporating a clause in their contracts which bars producers from exploiting their voices, body scans, performances and likeness beyond the work for which they are hired, according to legal firms which have been involved in the drafting of the contracts.
It comes at a time when artificial intelligence (AI) poses increasing challenges to the industry, assisting makers in using actors' voices, body scans and other aspects of their personalities in various post-production tasks of film-making. Producers exploit these assets across creative works such as dubbing films and advertisements.
Priyanka Sinha, co-founder of law firm A&P Partners, said, ""Today, if a producer or a third party uses an artist's voice or likeness beyond the agreed terms without a prior written consent, it will constitute a breach of a contract.""
Legal firms are drafting actors' contracts in such a manner that they cover almost all key assets associated with them.
Chandrima Mitra, partner at the law firm DSK Legal, said, ""There are multiple layers of approvals built into contracts. These include languages in which a talent will dub and when a party can use a different voice artist or a technology tool for dubbing the voice of the talent.""
Live Events
Most A-list actors have been adding this clause in their contracts to seek transparency and fairness in the exploitation of assets of their personalities and creative contributions, producers and casting directors told ET.
Casting director and film-maker Mukesh Chhabra said, ""I am aware of this clause. A-list actors are incorporating this clause in their contracts. The idea is to safeguard their creative contributions in a work.""
Concurring with him, the head of a leading film studio said on condition of anonymity, ""Most A-list actors have realised the scope and the extent to which their unique assets can be exploited. A-list actors such as Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Shahrukh Khan and Ranbir Kapoor have been putting this clause in their contracts.""
A key reason for A-list actors insisting on this clause is the apparent reluctance of producers and content makers to understand that actors' assets are part of their unique identities, said people in the know.
Suniel Wadhwa, co-founder and director of Karmic Films, said, ""In an era where AI blurs the lines between reality and replication, protecting an artist's identity is more crucial than ever. True artistry lies in emotion, expression and the irreplaceable magic of cinema, and these cannot be compromised.""
The clause refers to the assets of actors and their creative contributions as ""personal data"", said the people involved in the drafting of the contracts.
Amit P Vermaa, a creative consultant for Hindi film actors, said, ""Today, actors' assets are their personal data. So, a challenge for actors is how to protect their personal data, which include their voices and body scans.""
Actors stipulate in the contracts that producers and makers must share the recorded or stored data of an artist after a film is made.
Sinha, co-founder of law firm A&P Partners, said, ""To ensure transparency in data usage, actors' contracts specify that a producer must share a recorded or stored data with an artist and permanently delete it upon the film's release across theatres, OTT (over the top) platforms or any other medium.""

Indian gaming industry bodies unite to establish Code of Ethics,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/indian-gaming-industry-bodies-unite-to-establish-code-of-ethics/articleshow/118842735.cms,10-03-2025,"The
All India Gaming Federation
(AIGF), the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS), and the
E-Gaming Federation
(EGF) have jointly signed a ‘
Code of Ethics
’ (CoE) to enforce consistent standards of user safety across the industry through the implementation of
responsible gaming
and advertising policies.
The CoE mandates annual third-party audits and comprehensive reporting mechanisms to ensure accountability and transparency.
The signing of the CoE follows a joint memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the three federations and the Advertising Standards Council of India. This initiative aims to tackle the growing concern over illegal betting and gambling advertisements by offshore entities and highlights the industry's proactive steps to enhance user safety.
In a joint statement, the three industry bodies stated that the CoE is based on global best practices and establishes a strong framework for responsible gaming, including age-gating, stringent KYC requirements, user-set spending limits, and self-exclusion options.
The Code applies to all
online gaming operators
that are members of the federations and offer skill-based real-money gaming services in India, safeguarding the interests of over 50 crore Indian gamers, the statement added.
Live Events
Gaming operators with an annual revenue of Rs 100 crore or more must implement the Code within six months from the date of signing, while those with annual revenues below Rs 100 crore will have nine months to comply.
Upon successful adoption, federations will issue a certification valid for one year, renewable annually following the completion of an independent third-party audit. The Code will be reviewed annually to assess its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
Key principles of the CoE include responsible gaming practices such as age-gating, non-operation in restricted states, and robust KYC mechanisms. To protect players, the CoE mandates data security and appropriate management of player funds. To promote fair gaming, it ensures integrity and fairness in gameplay. Gaming platforms must also provide clear and accurate information to players, enabling informed decisions through self-exclusion options, spending limits, and tools for identifying and assisting at-risk players. To encourage responsible advertising, the CoE requires ethical advertising and promotions.
Roland Landers, CEO of the All India Gaming Federation, said, “As the largest and oldest industry association, we at AIGF believe that a thriving gaming industry must be built on the pillars of responsibility, transparency, innovation, and player protection. This Code of Ethics reinforces our commitment to fair play, compliance with Indian laws, and fostering a secure and responsible gaming environment. Through collaboration with other industry federations, we are setting new benchmarks for
ethical gaming
, strengthening the credibility of India’s online gaming sector, and building a sustainable, globally competitive ecosystem.”
Commenting on the initiative, Neil Castelino, Director General of FIFS, said, ""This joint code marks a significant step forward in our commitment to fostering a safe, fair, and responsible gaming environment in the country. By working together as an industry, we are setting a unified standard that prioritises player well-being, integrity, and accountability across the industry. This we believe will be pivotal in ensuring a safe environment for the 24 crore FS users in the country.""
Anuraag Saxena, CEO of EGF, said, “National interest, consumer interest, and the industry’s interest have all suffered too long. Unethical gambling operators have been parasitically harming the nation, its exchequer, and its people. I’m delighted that the industry is collaborating on the joint code-of-ethics today. The adoption of these standards reinforces our commitment to accountability through third-party audits, responsible gaming policies, and ethical business practices. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the industry taking due cognisance of this is a great step ahead for gaming in India.”

South India stays loyal to Pay-TV in times of OTT,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/south-india-stays-loyal-to-pay-tv-in-times-of-ott/articleshow/118793631.cms,08-03-2025,"The south Indian market has remained resilient amid pay TV's decline, especially in the Hindi-speaking market (HSM), driven by strong consumption habits, affordability and innovative content, said industry experts. HSM has been experiencing a steep decline in its pay-TV subscriber base due to the rise of OTT, YouTube and DD Free Dish, the free direct-to-home (DTH) service from Prasar Bharati.
However, OTT platforms and DD Free Dish have yet to make a significant impact on the south Indian pay-TV market, as television remains an affordable medium in this region, driven by low average revenue per user (ARPU), experts note. Pay-TV APRU in south is ₹200-₹250 against ₹250-₹300 in the HSM, said industry experts.
According to industry estimates, south India accounts for almost half of the pay-TV market despite having a smaller population than HSM. They add that the number of pay-TV homes in the country has declined to 84 million in recent times from 120 million, primarily due to churn in HSM. ""HSM has a higher ARPU compared to the south, but the churn there is very high. The south, on the other hand, has low ARPU due to local government interventions. However, the TV subscription market remains strong due to affordability,"" said a top TV broadcast executive, speaking on condition of anonymity.
South India's TV market comprises Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada language markets, with Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh-Telangana traditionally having significantly higher pay-TV penetration compared to HSM. The key players in the south market include JioStar,
Zee Entertainment
and
Sun TV Network
, which is the regional powerhouse.
According to Ficci-EY 2024 report, TV viewership in south India averaged 4 hours a day in 2023 vs 3 hours and 30 minutes in HSM. TV advertising spend across the four south Indian languages is estimated to be close to $1 billion. Apart from a loyal audience base and strong regional content, south market benefits from a robust retail advertising sector, reducing dependency on national advertisers.

""We need to analyse audience behaviour across markets in detail. When examined, linear TV in southern markets demonstrates stronger resilience, driven primarily by one key factor - engaging content,"" said TAM Media CEO LV Krishnan.
He noted that the southern pay-TV market also faces less competition, as DD Free Dish has not gained a foothold in the region.
Additionally, fragmentation is controlled by the premiering of blockbuster films on mainstream general entertainment regional channels. ""This has ensured that audiences remain loyal to a limited selection of channels within each language segment. As a result, 75% of advertisers on these linear TV channels stay loyal and exclusive to them,"" he noted.
According to Jai Lala, CEO of
Zenith India
, viewership in HSM has softened in recent years due to multiple reasons including fragmentation of viewership both within and beyond the television landscape. ""The regionalisation of India's media environment has played a significant role in this shift,"" he added.
While south India has had a strong regional identity, Lala said Hindi regions in northern India are experiencing similar fragmentation. ""This growing demand in north for content in regional languages, such as Bhojpuri and Punjabi, has fuelled diversification in viewing habits, as audiences seek locally relevant and culturally resonant content,"" he added.

"Diljit Dosanjh, India's rising global music star, is breaking the Bollywood mold",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/diljit-dosanjh-indias-rising-global-music-star-is-breaking-the-bollywood-mold/articleshow/118750908.cms,06-03-2025,"For decades, Indian music has been synonymous with Bollywood, whose glossy soundtracks have long dominated the country’s music market. But a seismic shift is underway, led by India’s rising global music star.
Diljit Dosanjh
, a 41-year-old musician, actor and producer from Punjab in northwestern India, is rewriting the formula for success in the world's fastest-growing music market. Moving away from traditional film soundtracks with his hip-hop and rap-infused rhythms and high-profile collaborations with pop icons like
Ed Sheeran
and Sia, Dosanjh is breaking boundaries and amassing a massive following.
Last summer, Dosanjh made an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where he was introduced as “the biggest Punjabi performer on the planet.” He regaled fans with hits Born to Shine and G.O.A.T.
His 2024 Dil-Luminati tour sold 742,000 tickets worldwide, according to Warner Music Group, making it the biggest tour of any Indian artist. The North America and European legs drew more than 346,000 fans combined and brought in more than $44 million.
“Indian music is not just Bollywood music,” said Dosanjh, who sings in his native Punjabi, in a phone interview while touring in the Middle East. “The traditional folk music in every part of the country is supremely good. It’s unfortunate that the world so far could only get a taste of Bollywood music that is commercial.”
Live Events
Dosanjh’s unique blend of musical styles, combined with his winsome personality and ubiquitous social media presence, is raising the profile of Indian music and proving to be a successful bet for his label Warner Music, a late entrant to the Indian market when it arrived in 2020.
While India ranks as the 14th-largest recorded music market, dwarfed by the the US and Japan, the influence of Indian music on global streaming charts has surged, thanks to a young and digitally savvy population. The Indian diaspora, estimated to be around 35 million and largely based in North America, the UK and the Middle East, is a major contributor to the demand for Indian music streaming and concerts. Consumption of music from India skyrocketed by more than 2,000% from 2019 to 2024, according to Spotify Technology SA.
There’s room for even more growth, according Jay Mehta, managing director of
Warner Music India
. The Indian music industry has a chance to double its base in the next three to four years, he said. Mehta has been exposing Indian artists to a wider, global audience by paring them up with the label’s international stars like Coldplay and One Republic.
People’s tastes have also evolved. According to Spotify, domestic fans streamed almost 70% international music on the platform when the company debuted in India in 2019, compared with 70% local music now. Punjabi tunes in particular are topping the charts, not just in India but among a global audience, according to Spotify. Dosanjh is partly responsible for that.
Over the past four years, a major change in how people consume music has taken place, “moving from a soundtrack-driven ecosystem to an artist-centric ecosystem,” Mehta said.
The shift plays to Dosanjh’s strengths—he’s a social media star who posts funny, heartfelt videos on TikTok and YouTube, encouraging engagement from fans. His online presence is a mix of humor, cultural pride, and personal moments, making him highly relatable. An avid cook, he often posts videos of himself brewing coffee or scrambling some eggs. He acknowledges his halting English is a barrier to greater reach, but still managed to convince Sheeran to sing a bit in Punjabi with him. He actively reposts fan content, creating viral sensations that amplify his brand, such as a dance challenge for his latest hit song, Water.
“Today, the digital era allows for instant global exposure,” Dosanjh said. “Any song I create has the potential to become a worldwide success overnight, thanks to this connectivity.”
The rise of artists like Dosanjh exemplifies the superfan strategy taking hold in India. Mehta has taken a page from the playbook of K-pop superstar BTS’ fan group, ARMY, to help drum up even more enthusiasm for Dosanjh and Hindi rapper King. One of the leaders of ARMY was recruited by Warner Music to spearhead social communication projects between the record label’s artists and their superfans.
This artist-driven model is boosting engagement with listeners who stream songs and buy tickets to see their favorite artists in person. The live-events business is booming in India. There were more than 30,000 concerts held in the country last year, and ticket revenue now outpaces sponsorships—a reversal of the pre-pandemic model, according to consultancy EY.
Described as having a “soulful” voice, Dosanjh’s live performances are brimming with energy, unique dancing and an engagement with the audience that has endeared him to legions of fans.
Dosanjh’s Coachella debut in 2023 marked a turning point, spotlighting Indian, non-Bollywood music on an international stage. He was the first act ever to perform at the festival entirely in Punjabi. “Music is a universal sound and universal force. You cannot limit it to one genre or category,” he said.
Since then, he has collaborated with Australian artist Sia on the Punjabi song Hass Hass, which helped elevate each artist’s profile in their home country. Sheeran joined the stage at Dosanjh’s concert in Birmingham, England, as a surprise guest for a remix of their hit track ‘Nania x Shape of You.’
Dosanjh is also an actor, best-known for the 2016 action crime film Udta Punja and Amar Singh Chamkila, a biographical drama about a Hindi singer, both available on Netflix, and Shadaa, a romantic comedy on
Amazon Prime Video
.
His popularity and high profile has given Dosanjh broad influence in India. In a conversation earlier this year with Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
, he pitched an idea to hold a global music festival in India bigger than Coachella.
The arrival of Spotify and other streaming platforms in India, the second-largest English speaking nation in the world, has played a crucial role in helping India raise the quality of its entertainment output. With diverse musical offerings from India, the number of countries that have songs from the country on top of their streaming lists is growing, said Ashish Pherwani, leader for the Media & Entertainment sector at EY in India.
“There’s more acceptance of Indian music that’s happening right now,” Pherwani said. “It’s just the tip of the iceberg. Honestly, there’s so much more that can happen around Indian content. It’s been a largely diaspora-oriented industry five years back, but that’s changing now.”

JioStar eyes strong ad revenue growth from IPL 2025 with multiple deals in place,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jiostar-eyes-strong-ad-revenue-growth-from-ipl-2025-with-multiple-deals-in-place/articleshow/118667881.cms,03-03-2025,"The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025, scheduled to take place from March 22 to May 25, is set to be the biggest season yet in terms of ad sales, with official media rights partner JioStar targeting 1 billion viewers across TV and digital, a senior company official said.
According to media buyers, JioStar has secured multiple sponsors for IPL 2025, including Campa, My11Circle, Birla Opus,
SBI
, Coca-Cola, Kent Fans, Amfi, Amul, Zupee, PhonePe, Jaquar Bath Fittings, and
Asian Paints
.
""We are pretty confident that IPL 2025 is going to be much bigger than IPL 2024. We are aiming for a billion viewers this season,"" said JioStar Chief Business Officer, Sports Revenue, SMB & Creator Ishan Chatterjee. He added, ""IPL has its own place in India's marketing calendar, and many brands plan their campaigns around it.""
JioStar has divided the IPL advertiser market into 40 categories. Typically, one or two major players per category dominate IPL advertising. However, this year, multiple brands within each category are actively participating, Chatterjee noted, citing examples from the fantasy sports and paints categories.
JioStar is also looking to expand its advertiser base by targeting both large corporations and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company recently conducted a multi-city roadshow to demonstrate how SMBs can leverage IPL for business growth through sharper audience targeting. SMBs are already major advertisers on Google- and Meta-owned platforms.
Live Events
Ad executives say IPL will continue to attract strong advertiser interest due to its consistent viewership, especially as summer marketing budgets increase.
""The IPL is like India's Super Bowl, offering advertisers a unique pan-India reach across demographics. It effectively engages the Male 15+ audience, which is otherwise difficult to reach through other platforms,"" said Mayank Shah, VP, Parle Products.
""While IPL is expected to remain strong on TV in terms of audience reach, the impact of its move behind a paywall on JioHotstar remains to be seen. We had anticipated delta reach coming from digital, as TV has already achieved significant scale.""
Chatterjee said IPL’s ad inventory is expected to be nearly sold out before the first match. ""Our goal is to have most of the inventory booked before IPL begins. Everything we have seen so far suggests we are on track,"" he noted.
IPL is believed to have generated around Rs 4,000 crore in ad sales last year, with JioStar increasing its ad rates by up to 15% for the current season. IPL first crossed the Rs 4,000 crore ad revenue mark across TV and digital in 2022.
Following the split in media rights between Star India (TV) and Viacom18 (Digital)—now merged as JioStar—rate undercutting and the division of rights kept cumulative IPL ad revenue stagnant since 2023.
However, media buyers anticipate a significant improvement in ad revenue this year due to strong advertiser demand across multiple categories and the consolidation of media rights under JioStar after two years. Some of the key advertising categories for IPL 2025 include mobile phones, paints, fantasy sports, consumer appliances, BFSI, FinTech, and beverages.
""IPL is a safe bet for most clients since it delivers consistent ratings compared to bilateral and international cricket events. The consolidation of IPL media rights will benefit JioStar,"" said a senior media buyer.

Bollywood's shift to streaming giants raises concerns over content diversity & market control,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bollywoods-shift-to-streaming-giants-raises-concerns-over-content-diversity-market-control/articleshow/118667724.cms,03-03-2025,"Bollywood's shift from a competitive content market to one controlled by a few major streaming platforms has raised major concerns among producers and industry players, mirroring the era when satellite rights dominated revenue streams, shaping content choices as filmmakers tailored films for family audiences.
The repeated failure of small and big ticket films has skewed the market in favour of a few deep-pocketed streamers like Netflix, Prime Video and Jio HotStar (see chart).
Three years ago, the industry was in a sellers’ market, where producers and filmmakers had plenty of options to secure funding. With at least ten mainstream streamers and a strong presence of production houses and studios actively creating and acquiring content, there was healthy competition, giving content creators more bargaining power.
In its latest research, media and entertainment research firm Ormax Media has said that the combined share of acquiring
theatrical releases
across languages of
Netflix and Amazon Prime Video
has jumped to a whopping 76% in 2024 from 60% in 2022, indicating a creation of a duopolistic market.
Live Events
After the pandemic, the film industry saw a major shift as a handful of deep-pocketed streamers managed to survive the repeated flops of big-budget films, while many others struggled. Some streamers pulled back on content creation and acquisition, while production houses and studios took a cautious approach, pausing new projects. With fewer players left standing, the market became more concentrated, giving the surviving streamers even greater control.
Producer Rajesh R Nair, known for films such as Kaminey and Adipurush, said, ""The industry has transformed into a buyers' market. A few streamers are negotiating hard and calling the shots. Producers are making films for streamers rather than theatres.""
He added that today, a conversation about a film starts with knowing whether a streamer is attached to the film. “People are more focused on pre-selling (before theatrical release) a film rather than making a film,"" he said.
With just a few streamers in control, content buying and production have slowed, limiting the variety of films being made. As a result, producers are making fewer films, reducing the number of new releases on both streaming platforms and in theaters. This downturn has hit exhibitors hard, forcing them to re-release older films just to cover their high fixed costs.
According to Ormax Media, the number of Hindi films released directly on streaming platforms dropped sharply from 53 in 2021 to just 18 in 2024.
Shrirang Nargund, a veteran and independent consultant on streaming business, said, “Big production houses provide streamers some good content. But streamers also buy not-so-great content from them. Streamers must train their acquisition teams in developing a strong sense of aesthetics and creativity. This will help them create and acquire content which will appeal to a large base of audiences, he said.
He added, there was enough strong content from mid-and-small-sized production houses and streamers should be bolder in their choice of content.
“Take for instance, the critically-acclaimed Malayalam film The Great Indian Kitchen. The film was initially rejected by mainstream streamers. Then, it was released on a local Malayalam streamer called Neestream. Subsequently, it gained popularity because of its storytelling. Much later, it was acquired by Amazon Prime Video.”
One upside of a concentrated buyers' market is that streamers have become more disciplined with costs. Streaming business consultant Shrirang Nargund noted that content budgets have been slashed by 40%, with a direct impact on actor remuneration.
Producer and film business expert Girish Johar explained, ""Today, streamers are more cautious with spending. A film only moves forward if an actor agrees to take a share of the profits instead of an upfront fee. Producers often have to negotiate with actors who are hesitant to lower their steep fees, which also include the costs of their entourage.""
Veteran producers said that the best way to address these challenges is to return to the traditional model—making films for theaters first and then generating additional revenue through rights sales.
Ameya Naik, producer and founder of Fantasy Films, said, ""Producers need to move away from the short-sighted approach of securing profits before a film even hits theaters by selling off rights. The focus should be on the creative journey of making films for a theatrical audience first."" He added, ""A box office hit benefits everyone—producers can negotiate better deals with streamers and TV channels, while platforms gain access to content that has already proven its appeal to audiences.""

Karnataka HC rules against inclusion of service tax in entertainment tax calculation on DTH,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/karnataka-hc-rules-against-inclusion-of-service-tax-in-entertainment-tax-calculation-on-dth/articleshow/118642099.cms,01-03-2025,"The Karnataka High Court has ruled that
service tax
should be excluded from the calculation of
entertainment tax
levied on TV broadcast subscription fees under Section 4G of the
Karnataka Entertainment Tax Act
, 1958.
This decision came in response to a petition by Direct-to-Home (
DTH
) operator
Dish TV India
. The order was passed on February 20.
Dish TV filed a revision petition challenging the
Karnataka Appellate Tribunal
’s (KAT) order dated July 29, 2022, which upheld the inclusion of service tax while levying entertainment tax on the DTH operator—a move it argued was unconstitutional.
The high court set aside the KAT's ruling and remanded the case for reconsideration, directing the tribunal to issue a fresh decision within three months after hearing all stakeholders.
Dish TV's counsel, Vivek Sarin, argued that Section 4G, read with Section 3 of the Act, clearly indicates that the term ""amounts received or receivable"" refers only to the consideration paid by subscribers to the
DTH operator
for distributing satellite TV signals. He contended that service tax should not be included in this calculation for entertainment tax purposes.
Live Events
He further pointed out that entertainment tax falls under Entry 78 of the State List in Schedule 7 of the Constitution, while service tax falls under Entry 97 of the Central List.
Thus, he argued that levying entertainment tax on the service tax would be constitutionally impermissible, requiring a restrictive interpretation of Section 4G to exclude service tax. The Section 4G levies a 10% tax on the subscription fee collected by DTH operators from consumers.
Additionally, Sarin highlighted that the Act does not define ""invoice."" Therefore, bills or statements of accounts, which itemise details such as the basic value of DTH broadcasting services, service tax, and licence fees, should have been considered as invoices for assessment.
Since this was not done, the KAT orders suffered from an error, he asserted.
Karnataka Additional Advocate General Aditya Vikram Bhat argued that Section 4G must be interpreted literally. He stated that the distinction between Section 3 and Section 4G justifies the inclusion of service tax in the taxable amount. He also contended that taxing a tax is not unconstitutional, citing examples of cess levied on income tax.
""In the above circumstances, this petition is allowed; the impugned order of the tribunal is set at naught; matter is remitted to the domain of the tribunal for consideration afresh in the light of the observations hereinabove made and in accordance with law. This remand would be decided within an outer limit of three months and after giving an opportunity of hearing to the stakeholders,” ruled the bench comprising Justices Krishna Dixit and G. Basavaraja.

"ICC Champions Trophy 2025: 110 million TV viewers in first three matches, digital viewership soars",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/icc-champions-trophy-2025-110-million-tv-viewers-in-first-three-matches-digital-viewership-soars/articleshow/118611484.cms,28-02-2025,"The first three matches of the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy, including the India versus Bangladesh game, clocked 110 million TV viewers across male and female audiences aged two years and above (MF 2+), according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) data.
Among the core male audience aged 15 and above, the reach stood at 46 million across urban and rural markets. The average TV Rating (TVR), which factors in audience reach and time spent, was 1.21 for the MF 2+ TG category and 1.68 for the Male 15+ ABC TG (target group) category.
For the India versus Bangladesh match specifically, the average TVR was 2.04 for the MF 2+ audience and 2.8 for the M 15+ ABC audience. Viewership for the first three games was decent and should pick up as the tournament progresses, said Navin Khemka, CEO South Asia, EssenceMediacom.
""It's a decent rating considering it's a longer format compared to T20. While ODI (one day international) ratings have declined in recent years, consumption has also shifted to multi-screen viewing due to the rise of digital platforms. Unlike before, people are no longer glued to TV screens for seven or eight hours. A lot of consumption is also happening on mobile devices,"" he said.
The
ICC Champions Trophy 2025
, which began on February 19, is being broadcast on the Star Sports and Sports18 networks in multiple languages, including English and Hindi. In its advertising pitch, JioStar, the official media rights holder for the ICC, set a target of reaching 450 million TV viewers throughout the tournament.
Live Events
JioStar has secured multiple sponsors, including Dream11, Pernod Ricard India, Beam Suntory, Kohler, Birla Opus, Vodafone Idea, ICICI Direct, McEnroe and Eicher Motors.
While TV ratings for the India-Pakistan match, played on February 23, will be released next week, the game set a new
digital viewership record
, amassing 602 million views on JioHotstar, the streaming platform formed by the merger of Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.
TAM Media CEO LV Krishnan said advertisers would be pleased with the viewership data, considering these numbers are for the initial matches and many high-profile games are scheduled later. ""Sports viewership has been on the rise due to the explosion of multiple devices. While viewership has become fragmented between TV and digital, the cumulative audience base has only increased,"" he said.
Sports viewership on television has been growing, with the Asia Cup 2023 attracting 366 million viewers. The ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 garnered 530 million and 541 million viewers, respectively, while the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 was watched by 404 million.
A JioStar spokesperson previously said that the company was in the process of finalising additional deals for the tournament, having secured partnerships across various categories, including BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance), FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods), auto, healthcare, bath fittings, fantasy gaming, paints and telecom.
For the Champions Trophy, JioStar has been seeking ₹55 crore for co-presenting sponsorship across both TV and digital.

According to Sacnilk, Chhaava—directed by Laxman Utekar—collected Rs. 21.75 crores net (early estimates) at the box office on Wednesday, a marginal rise from its Tuesday collection of Rs. 18.5 crores. The film clearly benefited from the

Day 12 [2nd Tuesday]: Rs. 18.5 Cr
Day 13 [2nd Wednesday]: Rs. 21.75 Cr (early estimate)
Total: Over Rs. 385 Cr
Globally, Chhaava is making headlines by crossing the Rs. 250 crore mark, becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of 2025. And the excitement isn’t over yet.
Expanding Horizons: Telugu Release
Chhaava will also be released in Telugu. The makers recently shared a poster featuring Vicky Kaushal as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj with the caption:
Live Events
""The epic tale of India’s courageous son, #Chhaava is now all set to roar in Telugu by popular demand. Witness the biggest spectacle #Chhaava in Telugu from March 7th. #ChhaavaTelugu Grand Release by #GeethaArtsDistributions. #ChhaavaInCinemas Now.""
Endorsements from the Top
The film has received notable nods from high-profile figures. Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
also mentioned Chhaava at the 98th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan at Vigyan Bhavan in Delhi, remarking: “Ye Maharashtra aur Mumbai hi hai jisne Marathi filmo ke saath saath, Hindi cinema ko ye unchai di hai. Aur in dino toh, Chhaava ki dhoom machi hui hai.”

Airtel says in talks with Tatas to combine Tata Play with Bharti Telemedia,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/airtel-says-in-talks-with-tatas-to-combine-tata-play-with-bharti-telemedia/articleshow/118577184.cms,27-02-2025,"Bharti Airtel
has said it’s in talks with the
Tata Group
to combine the latter’s
direct-to-home business
, housed under
Tata Play
, with Bharti Telemedia — a unit of the Sunil Mittal-led telecom operator.
“Bharti Airtel and Tata Group are in bilateral discussions to explore a potential transaction to achieve a combination of Tata Group’s DTH business housed under Tata Play Ltd, with Bharti Telemedia Ltd, a subsidiary of Airtel, in a structure acceptable to all parties. The above is at a discussion stage only,” Airtel said in an exchange filing Wednesday.
ET had reported on Tuesday that the Tata and Bharti groups are finalising a merger between their loss-making DTH businesses, Tata Play and
Airtel Digital TV
, especially at a time when consumers are rapidly migrating to digital platforms for video consumption and live streaming.
ET had reported that the proposed merger would happen through a share swap and help boost Airtel’s non-mobile revenues through convergence. As per the ET report, Airtel will hold a majority stake of around 52-55% in the combined entity while Tata Play shareholders, including Walt Disney, would hold 45-48%. The combined entity is likely to be run by Airtel’s senior management though Tata is learnt to have sought two board seats, the ET report added.
Live Events
Both DTH operations are being valued more of less equally at around Rs 6,000-7,000 crore as per the ET news report.
Airtel shares were up 2.55% to Rs 1641.60 in late afternoon trade on BSE Wednesday.
Tata Play, India’s largest DTH player, was originally Tata Sky and began as a JV with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. The Walt Disney Co took over that stake when it acquired Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox in six years ago.
As per the ET report, Airtel will get access to Tata Play’s 19 million homes, supporting its `triple play’ of strategy of bundling telecom, broadband and DTH services.
A potential deal will mark the second major transaction in the DTH space in about a decade following the Dish TV-Videocon d2H merger in 2016. It also coincides with
Reliance Industries
and Walt Disney merging Star India and Viacom18 to form JioStar, India’s largest media and entertainment company with revenues of Rs 26,000 crore in FY24.

"Tata Play, Airtel Digital TV near merger plans as DTH industry struggles amid streaming boom",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tata-play-airtel-digital-tv-in-merger-talks-as-dth-industry-struggles-amid-streaming-boom/articleshow/118539510.cms,25-02-2025,"Mumbai: The Tata and Bharti groups are finalising a merger between their loss-making direct-to-home (DTH) businesses,
Tata Play
and
Airtel Digital TV
, respectively, said people with knowledge of the matter. This comes as Indian consumers are cutting the cord and migrating to digital platforms for video consumption and live streaming.
The merger will take place through a share swap and help bump up Airtel’s non-mobile revenues through convergence. Airtel will hold more than 50% in the combined entity, said the people cited. Tata Play, India’s largest DTH provider, was originally Tata Sky and began as a joint venture with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. The Walt Disney Co took over that stake when it acquired Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox in 2019.
Airtel will get access to Tata Play’s 19 million homes, supporting its ‘triple play’ strategy of bundling telecom, broadband and DTH services.
The deal will mark the second major transaction in the DTH sector in about a decade, following the Dish TV-Videocon d2h merger in 2016. It also coincides with
Reliance Industries
and Walt Disney merging Star India and Viacom18 to form JioStar, India’s largest media and entertainment company with revenue of Rs 26,000 crore in FY24.
ET was the first to report on a likely Airtel Digital TV-Tata Play transaction on October 8 last year.
Live Events
Both sides are expected to announce a heads of terms agreement in the coming days, following which due diligence will begin. After the merger, Airtel is expected to hold 52-55% of the combined entity while Tata Play shareholders, including Walt Disney, will hold 45-48%. The company is expected to be run by Airtel’s senior management though Tata is understood to be seeking two board seats. Both operations are being valued “more or less equally” at around Rs 6,000-7,000 crore, said one of the people cited.
“This will be a non-binding agreement,” said an executive. “But with both sides engaged for months, they should move fast to close out all the outstanding issues. For Tata, this has been a drag, and like telecom, they are striking an alliance with a group they are comfortable with.”
Airtel Digital TV is housed in Bharti Telemedia Ltd, which in turn is a wholly owned arm of the listed flagship
Bharti Airtel
.
Tata Sons, the holding company of the diversified conglomerate, owns 70% of Tata Play, having bought out Singapore investment firm Temasek Holding Pte’s 10% stake in April 2024 for Rs 835 crore ($100 million), valuing the company at $1 billion, down a third from its $3 billion pre-pandemic valuation. With IPO plans dropped and losses mounting, valuations have dipped further, said industry executives.
Disney will continue to own shares in the combined entity as the other stakeholders are unlikely to buy them out for cash at this juncture, said the people mentioned above. The US media giant has been looking to exit the TV distribution business after pruning its portfolio and merging its media operations with Reliance Jio in India.
The two entities had a total 35 million paid subscribers as of September 2024, while FY24 revenue exceeded Rs 7,000 crore. Additionally, Tata Play also has half a million broadband customers through its subsidiary Tata Play Broadband.
Airtel, Tata Sons and Disney didn’t respond to queries.
Tata Play declined to comment.
Analysts said consolidation is inevitable, given the decline of the pay-TV industry due to competition from video streaming and DD Free Dish, the free DTH platform operated by public broadcaster Prasar Bharati. Bharti Airtel's eventual plan is to explore converting Tata Play's top 5 million DTH customers into broadband customers with higher average revenue per users (ARPUs), said analysts.
The pay-TV subscriber base has shrunk from 120 million to 84 million homes in recent years. The decision by major broadcasters to make their free Hindi general entertainment channels (GECs) available on DD Free Dish is expected to further erode the pay-TV market. However, JioStar’s move to place live sports behind a paywall on its streaming service could provide some relief to pay-TV platforms.
A September (TRAI) report said the pay DTH subscriber base fell to 62 million in FY24 from 70 million in FY21 and had further declined to 60 million as of September 2024.
“Even though the DTH and broader pay-TV industry are in decline, Airtel will still be the largest player in the pay-TV market, with the ability to offer multiple services by bundling telecom, broadband, and DTH,"" said a DTH sector expert.
DTH operators have expanded their offerings beyond aggregating linear TV channels to aggregating OTT platforms digitally in an effort to retain subscribers and enhance engagement. However, experts argue that telecom operators are best positioned to dominate the OTT aggregation space due to their scale and ability to bundle data with content.
“There are a lot of contingent liabilities in the sector, most of which are regulatory in nature. From adjusted gross revenues (AGR) dues to GST, it's bothersome, especially when you are in an exit mode,” said another industry veteran.
According to demand notices issued by the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) for FY23 and FY24, Bharti Telemedia has a potential liability of Rs 5,580 crore related to disputed licence fees. The company had made provisions of approximately Rs 3,426 crore as of March 31, 2024, but does not anticipate any immediate payout.
Similarly, Tata Play has received a consolidated licence fee demand of Rs 3,628 crore, including Rs 1,401.66 crore in interest, from the MIB.

Why Malayalam film industry needs a structural reset to thrive both artistically and commercially,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/why-malayalam-film-industry-needs-a-structural-reset-to-thrive-both-artistically-and-commercially/articleshow/118486130.cms,22-02-2025,"Every one loves Malayalam cinema. Just ask them. Critics gush. Film festivals swoon. North Indian cinephiles drop references to Aattam and Manjummel Boys at dinner parties to establish their impeccable taste. But in the immortal words of Jerry Maguire: “Show me the money!” If love paid bills, Malayalam producers wouldn’t be threatening a complete indust r y shutdow n from June 1.
It’s a curious paradox: 2024 was a banner year for Malayalam cinema when the survival drama Manjummel Boys, with a Rs 20 crore budget and gross earnings of Rs 240+ crore, became the highest grossing Malayalam film ever, while Gen-Z romance Premalu, with a Rs 3 crore budget and Rs 136 crore in revenue, emerged as possibly India’s most profitable film of the year. There are plenty of others that left a lasting imprint on the cultural landscape.
Aavesham, an action film starring Fahadh Faasil, became a phenomenon, dominating social media with viral reels and memes. Aattam, a movie that deals with sexual harassment and brought to life by a cast of nine actors from theatre, clinched the National Award for Best Feature Film as Malayalam cinema swept eight awards at the 70th National Film Awards. The critic’s darling of Indian cinema was finally getting its due.
Meanwhile, in Kerala, producers stared at their balance sheets with such desperation that you would think they were mentally cataloguing their organs by market value.
The brutal economics of filmmaking has always involved risk—most businesses understand that failure is more common than success. But in Malayalam cinema, we are witnessing a particularly perverse form of capitalism: actors pocket 60% of production budgets and walk away unscathed when films tank, only to demand higher fees for their next project, according to
G Suresh Kumar
, vice-president of the
Kerala Film Producers Association
(KFPA). The producer alone bears the crushing weight of failure, he says.
Live Events
Industry insiders point to the case of the Tovino Thomas-starrer Identity —produced at Rs 30 crore, it collected a mere Rs 6 crore in January, approximately equal to the actor’s paycheck. While Thomas reportedly offered another date to help the producer recoup losses, the fundamental question remains: if actors inflated their rates during the OTT boom, shouldn’t they settle for less money, now that the bubble has burst?
The cautionary tales are piling up faster than unpaid invoices. Take Sureshanteyum Sumalathayudeyum Hrudayahariyaya Pranayakadha, starring newcomer R ajesh Madhavan. It began with a budget of Rs 4 crore but ballooned to Rs 20 crore— a 500% increase, equivalent to the cost of a typical
Mammootty
film —with allegedly no cost-control efforts from director Ratheesh Balakrishnan, according to coproducer Ajith Thalappilly.
Thalappilly says he had to sell his Mercedes-Benz and teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, saved only by a last-minute intervention from a distributor. The director still collected his hefty paycheck, speculated to be Rs 1 crore, and demanded 30% profits from a film that spectacularly flopped, according to an industry insider who requested anonymity.
THE ANTICLIMAX
This isn’t the industry’s first financial crisis. Malayalam cinema has weathered storms before, but the scale has changed dramatically. Where losses once registered in lakhs of rupees, they now balloon into double-digit crores, creating recovery periods measured in decades rather than years.
What makes today’s predicament particularly treacherous is the aftermath of a false prosperity. The Covidera OTT windfall had created a dangerous illusion. Streaming platforms were snapping up every Malayalam film, regardless of quality, paying premium prices that inflated everyone’s expectations. Actors doubled their fees overnight. Directors expanded budgets. Producers borrowed heavily, convinced that streaming rights would cover their investments.
Then reality hit with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. OTT platforms “recalibrated” their approach, realising that Malayalam cinema’s audience reach didn’t justify their splurge, says an industry insider requesting anonymity. The new playbook: wait to see which films succeed in theatres, then cherry-pick the winners. For most producers, this means no OTT deal at all.
“Actors were thinking, if
Allu Arjun
can rake in Rs 400 crore, why can’t we manage Rs 1.5 crore? But when the bubble burst, they were not reducing their fee,” says the person quoted above.
Even the lucky few who secure streaming contracts face brutal negotiations, delays designed to pressure desperate producers into accepting lower fees, and payment schedules stretched over months. By the time the money arrives, interest on production loans would have already eaten away any potential profit.
Most Malayalam producers borrow from just four or five private financiers at interest rates that would make loan sharks blush—20-25%. Many end up bankrupt, their artistic dreams sacrificed at the altar of compound interest.
In one way, Suresh Kumar and his peers are reaping what they have sown. Like today’s OTT bubble, satellite television created a similar windfall at the start of the millennium, delivering huge profits for makers, actors and producers. Kumar particularly scored big during this period as one of
Mohanlal
’s main producers, until the actor began producing films himself.
LORD OF ALL BUDGETS
These fault lines erupted recently when Su resh Kumar publicly revealed the budget of Empuraan, starring superstar Mohanlal and directed by Prithviraj—a staggering Rs 140 crore, making it the most expensive Malayalam film ever. Kumar suggested that Tamil Nadubased Lyca Productions, which recently suffered massive losses from Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan starrers, was being “duped” into the Kerala market with promises of returns that don’t exist.
This ignited a firestorm. Antony Perumbavoor, Mohanlal’s long-time producer and confidant, issued a detailed rebuttal that was later shared by both Prithviraj and Mohanlal. Despite Kumar and Mohanlal being schoolmates and former collaborators, the controversy revealed a deeper schism—not between old friends, but between competing visions for Malayalam cinema’s future.
ACTORS’ COMPANIES
“The fight is not among them, but between an old guard and a new guard,” says an industry insider. Filmmakers like Prithviraj are charting a new territory, creating big-budget spectacles with global ambitions. “Empuraan’s cinematography is conceived with a worldwide audience in mind. The director wasn’t afraid to hire helicopters for action sequences, while the average Malayalam producer thinks twice before renting a Range Rover,” says someone from the production team.
Interestingly, amid this financial carnage, some of the industry’s biggest hits recently were produced not by traditional studios but by actors and directors themselves. Manjummel Boys came from actor Soubin Shahir and his circle under Parava Films. Premalu (along with critics’ darlings like Kumbalangi Nights and Joji) emerged from the creative triumvirate of actor-director Dileesh Pothan, writer Syam Pushkaran and Faasil.
This shift reveals two simultaneous truths: established producers are becoming increasingly risk-averse toward experimental content, and creative talents are seeking autonomy over their artistic visions.
Superstar Mammootty’s production company exemplifies this evolution. Through Mammootty Kampany, the veteran actor has systematically shattered his macho image, portraying characters who cry, experience loss, engage in explicit sexuality, commit honour killings and even come out as gay. In films like Rorschach, Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam and Kaathal, Mammootty seems to be redefining what Malayalam cinema can explore.
Would traditional producers have green-lit these boundary-pushing projects? The evidence suggests otherwise. Other artist-led production companies also claim they are filling a creative void left by risk-averse legacy producers, even as they navigate the same treacherous financial landscape.
They believe this is an evolutionary phase of Malayalam cinema as it attempts to transform itself, reaching for audiences beyond Kerala’s borders. This ambition demands bigger stars, higher production values and technical crews of international calibre—all of which cost substantial sums that the traditional financing model cannot sustain. The legacy producers, the new guard believes, are not in sync with this new grammar of cinema trade and most have lost touch with ground reality both in terms of content and structure.
Beyond these creative tensions, the industry’s structural problems extend beyond Kerala’s borders. None of the mainstream OTT platforms have appointed decision-makers who can green-light Malayalam projects independently. Approval must come from Mumbai—a process that reveals either a fundamental lack of trust in local talent or a cynical assessment of the market’s importance. Either way, it creates additional hurdles for an already struggling industry.
What makes this situation particularly ironic is that all of this is happening in an industry that remains one of the most disorganised (most sets don’t even have a washroom for women), exploitative and poorly paying to writers, technicians and crew in India.
The fundamental problem, everybody agrees, is mathematical— Kerala’s cinematic brilliance is trapped in a population constraint. With just 3.5 crore people in the state and industry estimates suggesting only 50 lakh regular moviegoers, the numbers don’t add up. The theoretical best-case calculation is if every regular movie goer watches a film (indicating pan-state acclaim), at Rs 200 per ticket, the film might gross Rs 100 crore.
From that theoretical maximum, subtract 30% for taxes and 30-40% for distributors, and producers are left with Rs 20-25 crore before deducting marketing expenses. Now consider that most Rs 100 crore grossers require star power—actors now commanding fees in crores—along with top-tier directors, technicians and even screenwriters (at least one recently charged over Rs 1 crore for a script). Add production schedules stretching 60-90 days, and your budget easily exceeds Rs 20 crore.
Where exactly is the sustainable financial model here? Even in the best-case scenario, producers are barely breaking even. Most films achieve only a fraction of that theoretical maximum, guaranteeing financial disaster. In January 2025, out of 28 films released, only Asif Ali’s Rekhachithram turned a profit, with the industry losing Rs 110 crore in a month, as per KFPA. For 2024, the industry released 200 films with only 24 achieving financial success, resulting in losses of Rs 600-700 crore.
TIME FOR A RETAKE
This means for Malayalam cinema to endure this transition, it needs more than just critical adulation and festival laurels. It needs a structural reset. The unchecked rise of actor fees must be reevaluated, ensuring that the burden of failure isn’t shouldered by producers alone. Financial institutions need to step in with saner lending rates before private financiers choke the industry’s future.
OTT platforms, if they truly value Malayalam cinema’s storytelling prowess, must establish regional decision-making bodies rather than treat the industry as an afterthought in Mumbai’s corporate boardrooms. Most importantly, producers must recognise that the age-old financing models— where success relies solely on Kerala’s limited theatrical audience—are no longer viable.
At the heart of it, the industry must decide what it truly wants to be. Right now, it’s like a half-baked screenplay— beautifully shot, critically acclaimed but structurally unsound. And as any filmmaker knows, no amount of festival buzz can save a story with a broken third act. Does it aspire to remain a niche darling of cinephiles and award circuits, or does it have the vision—and the discipline—to build an ecosystem that thrives both artistically and commercially?
Because right now, nobody loves Malayalam cinema—if you ask the people who produce it.

brought together some of the most promising entrepreneurs, each presenting bold solutions across diverse industries. With a high-profile set of judges—including Tim Draper, investor Ryan Bloomer, public figure Lauren Birnbaum, and actress-turned-producer Polly Draper—winning them over was anything but easy. Four startups pitched their groundbreaking ideas, hoping to secure recognition and support.
Erin Dawicki and Brenda Ong, Co-founders of
LymeAlert
, introduced a home tick-testing kit designed to detect Lyme disease before symptoms appear. Rather than testing the patient, their solution examines the tick itself, allowing for faster treatment decisions. With a staggering 54 percent of ticks in the New England region carrying Lyme disease, their approach aims to reduce misdiagnosis and delayed treatments. The judges acknowledged the need for better Lyme disease awareness. They also raised concerns about consumer adoption and the complexities of changing behavioral habits regarding tick removal and testing.
Reaction Dynamics’
Chief of Staff, Jesse Mikelberg, presented a vision for space technology. The company focuses on delivering critical space assets and satellite infrastructure for governments and commercial entities. With $10 million in private capital and an additional $10 million in government grants, Reaction Dynamics is well-positioned to drive advancements in satellite communications and space-based networks. The judges were thoroughly impressed by the clarity of the pitch, with Polly Draper highlighting Jesse’s ability to make complex concepts accessible.
Pirangelo Raiola, CEO and Co-Founder of
NORA Health AI
, presented the first AI-driven assistant for personal health management. By integrating chat-based symptom analysis with imaging and motion tests, NORA aims to empower users with tailored, preventative healthcare insights. The goal? Bridge the gap between self-diagnosis and professional care. While the judges found the concept intriguing, some sought further clarity on its usability and differentiation from existing digital health solutions.
Takenos
Founder and CEO Lucas Posada introduced a fintech solution aimed at cross-border workers, freelancers, and contractors. The platform provides seamless access to virtual accounts in the US and Europe, facilitating instant payments in local currencies or stablecoins. With 10,000 monthly active users and a bootstrapped path to profitability, Takenos is making financial inclusion a reality for global workers. Judges were particularly interested in the competitive edge of the platform, with Ryan Bloomer recognizing its potential to streamline international payments in regions like Latin America.
As the competition reached its climax, Tim Draper gathered the judges and contestants for the final decision. With all hands on the crystal ball, the winner was announced:
Reaction Dynamics.
The startup’s strong financial backing, strategic partnerships, and innovative approach to space infrastructure cemented its victory.

Champions Trophy: Hype or hyper? India-Pakistan clash puts ads on the boil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/champions-trophy-hype-or-hyper-india-pakistan-clash-puts-ads-on-the-boil/articleshow/118427946.cms,21-02-2025,"New Delhi: Advertisers are racing against time and competitors to buy the few available advertising slots for Sunday's India-Pakistan match at the Champions Trophy in Dubai, pushing 10-second ad rates to ₹50 lakh-double the rates for other matches, media executives said.
Regular advertisers such as Coca-Cola, Mother Dairy and RedBeryl are also looking to score big with new campaigns during the marquee match which, according to Mother Dairy managing director Manish Bandlish, ""is set to capture the undivided attention of the entire nation.""
""The India-Pakistan match has the ability to overcome inertia and lack of budgets from advertisers,"" said Sam Balsara, chairman of media and marketing company Madison World.
""Being a weekend, this is the main draw of the tournament,"" he added. An executive at a large media buying company said ad rates for this match ""are going at a 100% premium compared to rest of the Champions Trophy."" Coca-Cola, an ICC global sponsor, said it is debuting a fresh campaign on match day. Company spokesperson said it will offer ""a first-of-its-kind interactive 'halftime' experience.""
Live Events
RedBeryl said it is releasing a campaign called 'MakeItBlue' to cash in on the hype. The luxury services provider is offering its members premier seating, complimentary gourmet food and beverages, and access to VIP lounges and private car services to and from the airport or venue during the tournament, its chief executive Manoj Adlakha said.
The India-Pakistan clash is clearly a top draw for Indian advertisers among the 15 matches of the eight-team tournament being played in Pakistan and Dubai-the latter because India refused to pay in Pakistan, citing security reasons.
""This match is critical for the tournament hype to pick up,"" said Navin Khemka, chief executive of GroupM-owned media buying agency EssenceMediacom, which represents Dell, P&G and Airtel. Those buying ad slots at high premium for Sunday's match include some auto and FMCG players besides some mid-tier brands that are new to live sports advertising, a media buying executive said.
A spokesperson of JioStar Network, the official broadcaster and streaming partner for the Champions Trophy, said the broadcaster would not comment on ad rates as a policy.
""This tournament is poised to be a landmark event, and the enthusiastic participation of top brands underscores the power of cricket,"" Anup Govindan, chief revenue officer, sports, at JioStar, said in a statement.
Bandlish of Mother Dairy said, ""Tournaments of this magnitude provide an ideal platform for brands like ours to connect with millions of fans."" The dairy cooperative has taken up strategic brand presence across broadcast mediums and prominent placements on the tournament, particularly during India matches and specially on the India-Pakistan match, he said.

JioStar courts advertisers for ICC Champions Trophy amid ad market slowdown,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jiostar-courts-advertisers-for-icc-champions-trophy-amid-ad-market-slowdown/articleshow/118427595.cms,20-02-2025,"Mumbai:
JioStar
is actively in talks with
advertisers
to sell TV and
digital ad inventory
for the
ICC Champions Trophy
amid a soft advertising market, with many brands adopting a wait-and-watch approach, according to industry sources.
The ICC media rights holder, aiming for
advertising revenue
of up to ₹1,500 crore from TV and digital, has secured 11 sponsors and 100 brands for the high-profile tournament. Some of the key sponsors include Dream11, Pernod Ricard India, Kohler, Birla Opus and
Vodafone Idea
.
Advertising executives note that the broadcaster still holds a substantial portion of TV and mobile ad inventory, allowing advertisers time to make decisions. ""As the tournament progresses, ad deals should pick up, particularly with the high interest in India matches, especially the India-Pakistan clash,"" said the head of a media buying firm, requesting anonymity.
The executive also noted that connected TV (CTV) continues to perform well, as many advertisers follow a total TV strategy. ""Unlike mobile, where brands focus on sharper audience targeting, CTV allows them to reach a broader audience through universe targeting, similar to linear TV,"" he added.

Dentsu South Asia CEO Harsha Razdan said the ICC Champions Trophy has been challenging because the inventory isn't selling easily. ""Ad rates are 15-20% higher than what partners were willing to pay. While CTV inventory is highly valuable, it has already been sold out. However, there is still significant potential for mobile and TV inventory,"" he said.
He further explained that the reason JioStar is not reducing ad rates at the moment is that it is an expensive property and they would want to recover their investments. ""With the merger and other market changes, they plan to completely revise baseline rates and set a precedence for the IPL,"" he added.
On TV, JioStar's sports network,
Star Sports
, is targeting a reach of 450 million. On digital,
JioHotstar
aims to expand its user base through the tournament. Formed after the merger of Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema, JioHotstar has 500 million users and 50 million subscribers.
""There has been heightened interest in the Champions Trophy across both TV and digital platforms. ICC tournaments evoke a unique excitement and fervour among fans when the Indian team faces off against the best teams globally,"" said a JioStar spokesperson.
Despite concerns over its timing ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025, JioStar remains optimistic about ad demand, driven by excitement around India's matches, particularly the much-anticipated India-Pakistan game.
""We are in the process of finalising additional deals for the tournament,"" the spokesperson added. The company has secured partnerships across various categories, including BFSI, FMCG, auto, healthcare, bath fittings, fantasy gaming, paints and telecom.
Advertising executives note that advertisers are keen on India matches and willing to pay a premium for them. TV spot rate for India matches is ₹28 lakh per 10-second spot, while CTV spot rate stands at ₹15 lakh.

Pay-TV players fret as channels return to DD free dish,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pay-tv-players-fret-as-channels-return-to-dd-free-dish/articleshow/118396827.cms,20-02-2025,"The pay-TV industry is facing fresh challenges as leading broadcasters JioStar,
Zee Entertainment
, and Sony Pictures Networks India prepare to relaunch free-to-air (FTA) Hindi general entertainment channels (GECs) on DD Free Dish, India’s largest free direct-to-home (DTH) platform.
These channels—Star Utsav, Colors Rishtey, Zee Anmol, and Sony Pal—featuring rerun content from pay Hindi GECs like Star Plus, Colors, Zee TV, and Sony TV, are expected to attract robust viewership, raising concerns about subscriber migration from pay-TV platforms. These channels had exited DD Free Dish in 2022 under pressure from pay-TV distributors like Tata Play.
Industry officials say the course reversal by GECs has the potential to intensify industry churn, already being fuelled by competition from over-the-top (OTT) platforms and DD Free Dish, which reaches an estimated 40–50 million households, offering a variety of entertainment, news, and regional channels without any subscription fee.
As per industry estimates, the pay-TV subscriber base has fallen further to around 84 million currently from a peak of 120 million a few years ago, largely due to changing viewer habits and growing popularity of streaming and free TV platforms.
""The pay-TV base has eroded even when these channels were not on DD Free Dish. While broadcasters' TV subscription revenue growth has slowed, they were also losing out on incremental ad revenue earned due to their presence on DD Free Dish,"" a senior executive at a leading broadcasting company said, downplaying concerns of pay-TV distributors.
Live Events
Till 2022, Sony Pal, Star Utsav, Colors Rishtey and Zee Anmol were collecting incremental ad revenues of over Rs 1,000 crore due to their extended reach through DD Free Dish.
While the availability of Hindi GEC content on DD Free Dish may impact pay-TV distribution platforms, it will generate incremental ad revenues for broadcasters, say experts.
""Broadcasters are making the right decision by returning to DD Free Dish, as it provides additional ad revenue at no extra cost by monetising existing pay-TV content,"" said Rajesh Sethi, media advisor at PwC India.
He added that revenue generated from repackaged content on DD Free Dish will allow broadcasters to strengthen their content offerings for both digital and pay-TV.
However, industry officials see a silver lining due to JioStar’s decision to halt free cricket streaming which could provide some relief to the pay-TV sector. Live sports, particularly cricket, have long been a major driver of television subscriptions, and limiting free access to such content may encourage viewers to return to traditional pay-TV services.
""Sports broadcasting has been a big driver of subscription revenue both globally and in India,"" said the head of a TV distribution company.
Agencies
The top broadcasters have secured slots on DD Free Dish for a one-year period starting April and have since amended their reference interconnect offers to classify these channels as FTA. Last year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) barred broadcasters from offering
DD Free Dish channels
as pay channels on pay platforms like Hathway and Tata Play.
Growing preference for free television has increased pressure on pay-TV operators, especially DTH providers like Tata Play and Dish TV, which have been steadily losing subscribers. A TRAI report revealed that the pay DTH subscriber base shrank from 70 million in FY21 to 62 million in FY24.
Adding to pay-TV's challenges, recent price hikes by broadcasters have triggered resistance from pay-TV distributors who fear that higher subscription rates may prompt households to reassess their entertainment spending, potentially accelerating the shift to FTA and digital alternatives.
Sethi feels that while DD Free Dish challenges pay-DTH, the bigger threat to the pay-TV ecosystem comes from YouTube and OTT platforms.

Jio Hotstar throws a curveball as tech glitch disrupts Champions Trophy opener,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jio-hotstar-throws-a-curveball-as-tech-glitch-disrupts-champions-trophy-opener/articleshow/118391664.cms,19-02-2025,"Millions of viewers across India were left frustrated on the opening day of the ICC Men's Champions Trophy as Jio Hotstar, the popular streaming platform, faced technical issues during the highly anticipated match on Wednesday.

""We are facing a technical issue with the broadcast provider. Stay tuned!"" wrote the Viacom18 Media-owned platform.
Jio Hotstar, a partnership between
Reliance Jio

Vodafone Idea

This impressive roster of brands reflects the widespread market confidence in the tournament's expansive consumer reach and its potential for significant commercial impact, according to JioStar.
“We are excited to bring the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 to millions of cricket fans in India, backed by a stellar group of sponsors,” said Anup Govindan, Chief Revenue Officer, Sports, JioStar. “This tournament is set to be a game-changer, and the participation of top brands highlights cricket's ability to unite.

Fantasy sports firms bet big on cricket to increase the run rate,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/fantasy-sports-firms-bet-big-on-cricket-to-increase-the-run-rate/articleshow/118366595.cms,20-02-2025,"Mumbai: The
fantasy sports
industry is relying on the
ICC Champions Trophy

Indian Premier League

Fantasy sports platforms (FSPs) such as
Dream11
, the front-of-the-jersey sponsor for the Indian cricket team, and
My11Circle
, an official sponsor of the IPL, have planned significant marketing investments for key cricketing events.
According to sources, both Dream11 and My11Circle are expected to finalise sponsorship agreements with JioStar for the IPL. Additionally, Dream11 is one of the sponsors with the broadcaster for the ICC Champions Trophy. They also hold jersey sponsorship deals with multiple IPL teams.
Dream11 chief marketing officer Vikrant Mudaliar highlighted the platform’s consistent growth, stating that with 235 million users, it has added approximately 70-80 million users over the last two years.

""We have good reasons to believe that there should be a healthy growth in terms of new users, it will be in the tens of millions, but what should be the exact number that we should try and target is something that we're still working on,"" he said.
Saroj Panigrahi, COO of
Games24x7
, emphasised the significance of My11Circle’s five-year partnership as an IPL associate partner, stating that it strengthens the brand’s connection with cricket fans.
""Our 360-degree marketing strategy—encompassing strategic partnerships both on and off field, including TV, digital, and beyond—is designed to amplify our brand and enhance user engagement throughout the IPL season. We prioritise strategic investments that drive meaningful engagement with our users,"" he said.
Regarding the impact of GST on FSPs, Mudaliar noted the challenge of assessing its effect on user behaviour. However, he emphasised that larger platforms like Dream11 have made efforts to alleviate the burden on users.
""It's focussing more on business and making sure that we deliver a great product experience to our users is what we have sort of focused on,"" he added, stressing that sponsorships and advertising in live cricket remain a key part of their strategy.
In the previous IPL season, My11Circle experienced substantial growth, witnessing over a 50% increase in teams created within the first two weeks and a similar rise in mega prize winners. ""This IPL, we anticipate building on that momentum, further strengthening My11Circle's position in the fantasy sports arena,"" Panigrahi added.
According to reports, Games24x7, which operates RummyCircle and My11Circle, saw its advertisement and business promotion expenses increase by 61.7% to Rs 1,421 crore in FY23. While Dream11's advertisement and promotional expenses increased 37.3% to Rs 2,964 crore in FY23.
A Deloitte and Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS) report indicated that FSPs generated Rs 9,100 crore in revenue, along with Rs 8,300 crore in indirect revenue. The user base for these platforms reached an estimated 225 million in FY24 and is projected to grow to 350 million by FY27.
However, GST changes have led to a 10% decline in the projected revenue of FSPs, reducing it to Rs 8,190 crore in FY25. The report anticipates recovery in FY26, with revenue expected to reach Rs 9,420 crore, followed by Rs 10,550 crore in FY27.

reality shows
like
Bigg Boss
,
Kaun Banega Crorepati
(KBC), and
Indian Idol
are becoming increasingly crucial for broadcasters, driven by their massive viewership and strong revenue potential amid shifting audience preferences and fragmented media consumption, say industry experts.
By breaking the monotony of drama-heavy programming, appealing to diverse demographics, and integrating seamlessly across
TV and digital platforms
, they remain a strategic pillar in
content strategy
, experts add.
Deepak Dhar, group CEO of Banijay Asia, the producer of Bigg Boss-India's adaptation of the Dutch reality show Big Brother-highlighted the show's massive scale, with adaptations in seven Indian languages, including Hindi, and a popular OTT version.
""We produce roughly 800 days of Bigg Boss content annually across TV and OTT in multiple languages-the highest anywhere in the world,"" he said. ""The scale of Bigg Boss Hindi alone is immense, with 1,200 to 1,300 people working on the show.""
While reality shows cost more to produce compared to dramas, they also deliver cumulative audience reach in excess of 100 to 200 million cutting across demographics.
Live Events
The cost per episode for a reality show ranges from ₹1 crore to ₹2 crore, while for dramas, it typically falls between ₹8 lakh and ₹10 lakh per episode, say industry executives.
The ad rates for reality shows rank second only to cricket, with broadcasters charging between ₹2 lakh and ₹4 lakh per spot.
A JioStar spokesperson, a major investor in reality TV across languages and formats including Bigg Boss, said reality shows have evolved from entertainment programmes into cultural phenomena.
A spokesperson for Sony Pictures Networks India, another key player in reality TV with shows like KBC, emphasised their ability to engage audiences across platforms, making them long-term assets.
Experts note that reality shows thrive on star power, with Amitabh Bachchan and Salman Khan driving the success of KBC and Bigg Boss, respectively. These formats use inspiring stories that connect with audiences by showing ordinary people accomplishing extraordinary things.
Fremantle India MD Aradhana Bhola highlighted the increasing shift towards
multi-screen consumption
of reality shows across TV and digital. This benefits her company as they retain the IP to major franchises like Indian Idol and India's Got Talent. It has started monetising some of the digital rights of its IPs.
Dhar also sees licensing and merchandising as an emerging revenue stream for IP owners.
Jai Lala, chief executive of media buying agency
Zenith India
, said reality shows provide a powerful blend of mass appeal and targeted engagement from a brand-building perspective.
""Their appointment-viewing nature ensures a committed audience, making them high-impact platforms for brands,"" he added.
Additionally, their interactive formats enable innovative branded content integrations, from product placements to brand-sponsored segments, Lala said, adding, the digital extensions of these shows via OTT, social media, and influencers further expand their reach beyond television, creating a multi-platform brand presence.

JioStar to expand sports bouquet with new channel launches ahead of IPL,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jiostar-to-expand-sports-bouquet-with-new-channel-launches-ahead-of-ipl/articleshow/118345186.cms,18-02-2025,"JioStar
, the joint venture formed by
Reliance Industries
, Disney, and Bodhi Tree, is undertaking a significant expansion and rebranding of its sports broadcasting portfolio to better serve regional audiences ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.
The company is launching several regional sports channels in both Standard Definition (SD) and High Definition (HD) formats. The Sports18 brand will be retired in favor of Star Sports. As part of this effort, five Sports18 channels will be rebranded as
Star Sports
, solidifying its position as the leading TV sports brand.
As per its latest regulatory filing, Star Sports 2 Hindi will replace the Sports18 1, offering Hindi-language sports content. Sports18 2 will transition to Star Sports 2 Telugu, catering to Telugu-speaking audiences, while Sports18 3 will become Star Sports 2 Tamil for Tamil-speaking viewers.
Additionally, Star Sports 2 Kannada will replace Star Sports First, focusing on Kannada-language sports content. Sports18 Khel will be rebranded as Star Sports Khel, maintaining its diverse sports programming.
The HD versions—Star Sports 2 Hindi HD, Star Sports 2 Telugu HD, and Star Sports 2 Tamil HD—are set to launch on March 15, 2025, to reach premium audiences. Star Sports 2 Hindi HD will replace the erstwhile Sports18 1 HD.
Live Events
Following the rebranding and new launches, JioStar's sports portfolio will expand to 24 channels across SD and HD formats in multiple languages.
In a bid to reach a broader audience, JioStar is transitioning its entertainment channels, Colors Rishtey and Star Utsav, to free-to-air platforms. This strategic move increases JioStar's FTA portfolio to six channels, targeting India's vast FTA viewership.
As part of its portfolio realignment, JioStar is discontinuing nine channels, including Comedy Central SD and HD, Vh1 SD and HD, MTV Beats SD and HD, Bindass, Colors Odia, and Star Kiran HD.
After the realignment, JioStar will operate a total of 130 pay and FTA channels across SD and HD formats, along with 83 broadcaster packs, including an FTA pack comprising six channels.

"""Practically speaking, I definitely want Anuja to appear for the exams"", shares Ananya Shanbag",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/practically-speaking-i-definitely-want-anuja-to-appear-for-the-exams-shares-ananya-shanbag/articleshow/118327544.cms,17-02-2025,"There is a fascinating scene in Anuja, the Indian short film which was nominated in the Best Live Action Short Film Category in the
2025 Oscars
. The sisters--
Anuja
(Sajda) and Palak (
Ananya Shanbag
)--are unable to sell cloth-made bags on a busy street in Mumbai. As these sisters negotiate with the crowd on the street, little do they realise that their humanness is not even acknowledged. They represent one of the sounds in the mélange of sounds which seems cacophony to the worried, anxious and disturbed in the city. To those who are acutely sensitive, their voices represent a measured and silent protest to achieve their rightful place in a city which takes so much and gives so little in return.
There are also people on the street who have lost the verve and determination to live meaningfully. For these, these sisters are mere spectacle. Then, there are those who are so intoxicated with the peaks of pleasures that reality changes for them when the geography of the reality changes. As Anuja enters a mall (a cinematic liberty), she is not only acknowledged but there is a woman who pays heed to her and is willing to buy a bag. Whether this is a comment on capitalism or to the fact that geography changes realities, the scene stays with a viewer. Anuja is able to sell a bag at a price much higher than she had considered. This is what sums up the story of the short film: Reality is not a linear deal for street kids. They are almost always in dilemmas which cover pleasures, duties, sufferings, dreams and sacrifices.
ET spoke with Ananya Shanbag, who played Anuja's understanding, mature and able elder sister in the film. She shares her experience in shooting the film. A trained Bharatnatyam dancer, Shanbag has given a credible performance in the film especially in scenes which demanded wordless interactions with Anuja. Perhaps, her training in Bharatnatyam helped her enhance her performance.
Following are the edited excerpts of the interview:
Could you tell us about your background?
I am a final year student of Christ University, Bangalore studying Performing Arts, English and Psychology. I am a Bharatanatyam dancer. I have been learning the art form for about fifteen years now. I completed my Bharatanatyam Arangetram in 2017.
Live Events
How did you get the role of Palak?
Romil Modi, a casting director spotted me at one of my Bharatanatyam performances. He thought I would be suitable for the role of Palak. I auditioned and got the role.
Were there any reference points of films for Anuja? For instance, the Hindi film Salaam Bombay, which deals with stories about street children, is a case in the point.
Yes, I did watch a few films which dealt with children of similar backgrounds. I learned a lot from Sajda (the actor who played Anuja) herself. I learnt the accent and mannerisms required for the role from her.
You have grown up in a different milieu. What is it you learnt about street kids and their lives while preparing and after playing the role?
I got to learn so much about them. There is definitely a lot of struggle in their lives. I have also realised they never give up despite challenges in their lives. It is inspiring to see how people of all age groups work and contribute in some way. There was a huge group of kids playing around cars. They were extremely joyful and curious about the whole process of shooting. While shooting the scene where we sell bags, I realised how hard they must be working every single day. Life is more challenging for them and they have to somehow make ends meet. I hope all the kids have a Palak in their lives.
What is your understanding of the ending of the film?
In my opinion, Anuja does what she feels is best for her sister. This is despite the fact that Palak works hard to get Anuja to write the exams. Actually, Anuja is put in a tough spot. If she goes back to the factory, she earns more money and Palak doesn’t lose her job. She also gets to be with Palak. However, if she appears for the exams, Palak will lose her job and Anuja will have to go away to a boarding school. Since they both have only each other, emotionally speaking, I would not want the two sisters to separate. However, practically speaking, I definitely want Anuja to appear for the exams.
Is there any particular scene which you enjoyed and it became a fulfilling scene as an actress?
The scene where we read matrimonial advertisements in the newspaper has to be one of my favourites. It was a semi-scripted scene. We didn’t particularly learn any lines so that we could crack whatever jokes came to our minds and have a genuine laugh. We had to bring out that sibling chemistry. It made our (Ananya’s and Sajda’s) bond stronger. Another scene would be the one where Palak tells Sajda about how she made the bags. I had to speak to the camera as if I was explaining Sajda the story and at the same time stitch the bag secretly and walk out of the factory pretending the bag was mine. So that was something that taught me a lot.
You are a trained Bharatnatyam dancer as well. Do you want to pursue acting as a profession or do you want to juggle your love for dance with acting?
Bharatnatyam will be my first love because it makes me the happiest. I don’t think I enjoy doing anything else as much as dancing. I have been learning and practicing Bharatnatyam for over fifteen years now. I do want to take it forward to bigger platforms. Having said that, Bharatnatyam has taught me how to express through my face and my body. So if any acting opportunities come my way, I will definitely consider them and give my best.

Delhi HC seeks OpenAI's response in ANI copyright suit,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/delhi-hc-seeks-openais-response-in-ani-copyright-suit/articleshow/118323259.cms,17-02-2025,"The Delhi High Court on Monday sought a response from
OpenAI
on an application filed by the Indian Music Industry (IMI), which seeks to intervene in a suit by news agency Asian News International (ANI) over the alleged unauthorized use of its content to train and operate
ChatGPT
. During the hearing, Justice Amit Bansal observed that the scope of the suit could not be expanded indefinitely, stating, ""We can’t keep expanding the scope of the suit; you can file your own suit. Hundreds of industries may be affected by it.""
The matter is listed on February 21, Friday.
Recently, a group of India's top Bollywood music labels, from T-Series to
Saregama
and Sony, were seeking to join a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI in New Delhi, highlighting worries about improper use of recordings to train AI models.
The Microsoft-backed company said that it is not obligated to enter into partnership deals with the media groups to utilise their content which is publicly available, the 31-page OpenAI court filing, reported by Reuters for the first time, showed.
What is the case about?
Back in 2024, Indian news agency ANI had sued OpenAI in a New Delhi court, accusing the ChatGPT creator of using its published content without permission to help train the artificial intelligence chatbot, something that OpenAI says it has stopped doing.
Live Events
In a statement, ANI said ""the court is required to decide the legitimacy of the use of publicly available proprietary content by AI platforms.""
ANI also accused OpenAI's ChatGPT of attributing fabricated news stories to the publication, according to its court submission dated Monday, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.
In its statement, OpenAI said that it was engaged in partnerships with many news organisations around the world and was holding talks to explore more, similar opportunities, including in India.

Old Hindi movies earn big bucks as Gen-Z buys into the cult craze,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/old-hindi-movies-earn-big-bucks-as-gen-z-buys-into-the-cult-craze/articleshow/118308406.cms,17-02-2025,"Indian exhibitors are cashing in on re-releasing
Hindi films
, with older titles like Tumbbad (2018) and
Sanam Teri Kasam
(2016) outperforming some fresh theatrical releases and eclipsing their original box-office performances, industry data shows.
Once-dormant films, many of which didn't perform during initial runs, are drawing robust audiences - particularly
Gen-Z
viewers - on streaming platforms, TV and in theatres. Sanam Teri Kasam raked in nearly ₹28 crore in eight days during its re-release, beating competition from three new films: rom-com Loveyapa, action thriller Sky Force, and historical drama Chhaava.
Exhibitors' move of re-releasing Hindi films with a cult following or strong viewership on television and streaming platforms is proving successful, as these films have outperformed their original runs and held ground against new releases, yielding significant returns.
Given the strong response, analysts predict that Sanam Teri Kasam will maintain its box-office momentum and easily surpass ₹50 crore in the coming days, a significant jump from its original ₹9.11 crore collection at release.
ET Bureau
Suniel Wadhwa, co-founder and director of Karmic Films, said, ""Today, re-releases are not just about filling a gap in the absence of fresh big-budget films. The catalog is carefully planned, selecting films that have gained a cult following or strong viewership on social media platforms, streaming services, and television.""
Live Events
""Additionally, affordable tickets, nostalgia, and great music are driving footfalls. A large number of Gen-Z audiences want to experience re-watching films in theaters. There are also those who are flocking to theaters for fear of missing out on an experience their peers are having,"" he added.
Producers also attribute the success of re-releases to two critical factors. One is that these films, which were largely mid- and small-budget, did not receive adequate screens in theaters at the time of their original release, which they are now getting. The other critical factor is that films appealing to the younger generation are rarely made today.
Naveen Chandra, founder of 91 Film Studios, a company that produces, finances, and distributes regional films, said, ""Today, high-dopamine and high-adrenaline rush films have found huge acceptance. Chhaava, which is a terrific film, is another example of a high-adrenaline rush and high-dopamine film released on Valentine's Day. So, where are the films that appeal to young audiences and their tastes?"" He added, ""These films are available on streaming platforms and television channels, yet the younger generation is coming to theaters largely because such films are not made today.""
Increasingly, a large number of highly aggressive action films have dominated the box office in recent years. Films such as Animal (2023), Kill (2024), and Marco (2024), which feature high levels of gore, are a few examples. In this context, it has been observed that a significant segment of the younger audience is discovering and enjoying romantic films in regional languages. For multiplexes, these re-releases make strong business sense, as reflected in increased footfalls and spending.
Devang Sampat, managing director at
Cinepolis India
, said, ""The transaction size, which is the number of people coming to theaters and spending, for a fresh film is generally 2.5. But for re-releases, it is four. This shows the difference."" He added, ""We keep asking young audiences on social media platforms about old films they want to watch and plan our schedule accordingly.""
The latest re-release exhibitors plan to screen is Andaz Apna Apna (1994)-a cult comedy that did not perform well during its original release. It is set to re-release in April.

LLC three years ago has contributed to Tata generating content for events such as Formula 1, World Rally Championship, DP World Tour, the South Korean league and Sail GP, the company’s Vice-President and Global Media head Dhaval Ponda said in an interview.
“We are largely becoming a virtual stadium of the world,” Ponda said, adding that sporting content the
Tata Group
unit generates reaches an audience of two billion people.
Ponda said the company has delivered 100,000 plus events and 15,000 plus hours of edge streaming in 190 plus countries. Those statistics, in other words, mean that a bulk of the content being streamed live is likely enabled by Tata Communications.
The global
live streaming
market is expected to grow to around $712.9 billion by 2033 from an estimated $104.9 billion in 2024, according to research and advisory firm Custom Market Insights. While the number takes into account all video and audio transferred in real-time including over social media, Tata Communication’s business concerns only the back-end content production for networks that already own broadcasting rights for events.
Live Events
Ponda declined to offer guidance on financial targets for the media vertical, but said he’s “confident of continuing to be a high growth business for Tata Communications’ digital portfolio.”
The Switch acquisition helped the company open a new production and delivery facility in Los Angeles to support growing global live content customers, he said. Tata Communications has also expanded its portfolio to cover everything from concerts to cricket and rugby world cups to college and post-college sports, news events, and the Oscars, he added.

The user base for these platforms has skyrocketed to an estimated 225 million in FY24, and is projected to reach 350 million by FY27.
The sector has also made significant contributions to government revenues, paying Rs 5,800 crore in taxes between FY18 and FY23. In FY23–FY24 alone, FSPs contributed Rs 4,150 crore in taxes, with projections suggesting this figure will rise to Rs 30,550 crore between FY24 and FY29.
However, changes in
GST
, including retrospective taxation, have impacted the fantasy sports industry, leading to a dip in projected revenue to Rs 8,190 crore in FY25. However, the growth may bounce back next year and touch Rs 9,420 crore, reaching Rs 10,550 crore by FY26.
The sports technology industry has become a key employment generator, creating 12,000 direct and indirect jobs in FY23. As the sector continues to expand, this number is expected to grow, further bolstering India’s economy.
The esports market in India is projected to reach Rs 1,286 crore by 2029, growing at a 25% CAGR from 2024 to 2029. Similarly, the game developers' market is expected to hit Rs 875 crore by 2029, with a CAGR of 27% during the same period (2024–2029).
Prashanth Rao, Partner at Deloitte India, noted the interconnectedness of the sports technology ecosystem with the broader sports industry. “The sports technology ecosystem is closely linked to the broader sports industry in India, which itself requires significant investment and support,” he said,
Rao noted that India's
sports tech
market is currently 1% of the global market, with significant growth potential compared to North America (34%) and APAC (30%).
Joy Bhattacharjya, Director-General of FIFS, echoed this sentiment, stating, “The entire sports tech sector is not just important, it’s vital for India’s sporting development.”
Bhattacharjya highlighted that technology is a major enabler, with advancements in AI, ML, AR/VR, and data analytics driving fan engagement and athlete performance, while Rao stated that fantasy sports have transformed fans from passive viewers to active participants.
Bhattacharjya said that the FSP industry is seeking clearer regulations, especially around distinguishing between games of skill and chance, and preventing capital flight to foreign countries. Retrospective taxation and lack of a stable policy regime are creating uncertainty for the FSPs, he added.
""The industry is not shying away from regulation but is seeking clarity and stability in policies to foster growth and prevent capital flight. We also want the debate over games of skill vs. games of chance to be settled once and for all,"" Bhattacharjya said.

Block bookings are on the rise as many films end as horror shows,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/block-bookings-are-on-the-rise-as-many-films-end-as-horror-shows/articleshow/118200239.cms,13-02-2025,"Block booking
of
movie tickets
by producers and stars has resurfaced as a major concern in the
film trade
, with its impact on opening collections of recent Hindi and pan-India films drawing scrutiny.
Industry insiders highlight two key issues in this growing trend: the scale of block bookings and their link to a film’s quality.
The practice pushes up first-weekend numbers, creating an illusion of success.
Among recent films, the multilingual Game Changer saw a higher share of block bookings than organic audience ticket purchases. According to data from box office tracking firm Sacnilk, out of Rs 2.5 crore in advance bookings, Rs 1.5 crore came from block bookings. However, the film failed to sustain momentum and grossed approximately Rs 155 crore on a budget of Rs 400-450 crore.
Veteran trade analyst Komal Nahta noted, “In the past, block booking was like salt in a well-cooked dish—never too much or too little, just adequate. However, for a recent film, the producers block-booked tickets worth Rs 40 crore (net collections) out of Rs 80 crore the film collected in a week's time. This shows how excessive block booking has become.”
Live Events
Analysts say that when block bookings outpace organic
audience demand
, films often struggle at the box office. A higher reliance on block bookings, trade experts note, also signals weaker content and poor long-term performance.
""Audiences cannot be hoodwinked. If a viewer books a ticket and finds 90% of the auditorium empty, the film is doomed through word-of-mouth,"" Nahta added.
Block booking occurs in several ways. Producers buy tickets in bulk for their affiliates. Corporations—especially brands associated with film stars—purchase tickets as part of endorsement deals, with ticket values often counted as part of a star’s remuneration. Additionally, producers barter tickets in exchange for services.
A producer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “Producers typically set aside 2-10% of a film’s budget for block booking after gauging the response to its trailer. They consider this a marketing expense.”
Trade analysts argue that block booking is often used when producers lack confidence in their films’ ability to attract audiences. By artificially inflating opening weekend figures, they aim to negotiate better deals with streaming platforms.
Movie trade analyst Girish Wankhede remarked, “Allocating a film’s budget to boost its first three-day collection is a recent phenomenon, but it’s not an honest approach. The aim is clear—producers inflate box office numbers to secure higher prices for digital and satellite rights.”
A recent box office forecast by media and entertainment research firm Ormax Media found that corporate bookings do not translate into sustained footfalls. Initial spikes in collections fail to hold if the film does not meet audience expectations.
Ameya Naik, producer and founder of Fantasy Films, said, “If a film’s trailer is well received, audience footfalls will grow organically. Block booking reflects a lack of confidence in one’s own creation. And audiences are smart enough to recognise this tactic.""

From 'Chhaava' to 'Loveyapa': Bollywood films hitting screens this February,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/from-chhaava-to-loveyapa-bollywood-films-hitting-screens-this-february/slideshow/118145960.cms,11-02-2025,,entertainment
Bollywood's northeast blindspot: A filmmaker's take with Jahnu Barua,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bollywoods-northeast-blindspot-a-filmmakers-take-with-jahnu-barua/articleshow/118072277.cms,08-02-2025,"In the early 1970s, Shillong became the stage for an unexpected flashpoint when a Bollywood movie laced with stereotypes ignited the fury of Naga students. Ye Gulistan Hamara, a Hindi film starring Dev Anand and Sharmila Tagore, revolved around a tribal community in the Northeast. But something cut deep. The Nagas found the song, “Mera Naam Aao”, and its picturisation a crude and offensive misrepresentation of their Ao brethren. Outraged, the students vandalised a movie hall, forcing the Meghalaya police to crack down with lathis. Several student protesters later found their way into the ranks of Naga insurgents, with one of them, VS Atem, becoming a top commander of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM).
Bollywood has long played fast and loose with the sensitivities of the Northeast, a region rich in linguistic and ethnic diversity. So when the second season of
Paatal Lok
dropped last month—featuring characters speaking Nagamese, the lingua franca of Nagaland, and capturing the state’s turmoil with rare nuance—it came as a refreshing surprise to those familiar with the region. Among the unexpected highlights was the presence of award-winning
Assamese filmmaker Jahnu Barua
, 72, who stepped in front of the camera to play Uncle Ken, a former rebel leader torn between his past and his vision of peace and prosperity for the troubled state. In an interview with Shantanu Nandan Sharma, the Mumbai-based director shares his thoughts on Bollywood’s portrayal of the Northeast and what led him to step out from behind the camera and into the spotlight. Edited excerpts:
You rarely step in front of the camera. What made you act in
Paatal Lok
, Season 2?
I acted in school plays a long time ago. But ever since I became a filmmaker, acting was never on my agenda. However, my close friends have known for decades that I have a knack for mimicking characters. Once Basu Chatterjee offered me the role of a Japanese astrologer in the television serial
Kakaji Kahin
(1988), and I obliged. Several fellow filmmakers have approached me with acting roles, usually for characters with a northeastern look, but I invariably declined. Often, such characters are introduced merely for comic relief, and I don’t appreciate that approach.
When the writer of
Paatal Lok 2
narrated the script to me, I felt the story was genuine and presented the Northeast with authenticity. The writer, Sudip Sharma, grew up in Guwahati and, more importantly, understands the sensitivities of the region. That convinced me to accept the role.
Live Events
Is acting a challenge for a director?
For a filmmaker, acting in a film is a beautiful experience, it brings a realisation. It is easy to shout at actors from behind the camera, but once you step in front of it, you truly understand the difficulties actors face. Playing Uncle Ken was particularly difficult. He is physically worn out, battling terminal kidney cancer, yet remains mentally strong. I was given a walking stick, but I had to portray a character with a strong mind.
What’s your take on the portrayal of Northeast India in mainstream Hindi movies?
It’s a two-fold issue: how the rest of India perceives the Northeast and how the Northeast views the mainstream, particularly cinema. For many filmmakers, the Northeast feels like an alien region, as though it is from another planet. Hindi cinema, driven by commercial interests, often overlooks themes or characters from distant regions because the market dynamics don’t demand it. This is a misguided perception, but that’s how films are made.
Is that the only reason we hardly see Northeast faces in Bollywood? Are language and accent a barrier?
Language and accent are not a problem at all. In the realm of visual arts, audiences often embrace diversity in language and accent—it’s seen as something beautiful. The real issue, I feel, is that many young talents from the Northeast, though full of dreams and talent, lack the aggression required to enter and survive in Bollywood. Danny Denzongpa (an actor from Sikkim) is an exception. Despite many obstacles, he carved a niche in popular Hindi cinema. The challenges are clear: most people from the Northeast have distinct physical features, which lead to discrimination. However, we must recognise that discrimination can happen anywhere in the world.
As someone from the region, does it hurt you?
Yes, it hurts. I recall popular actors and filmmakers asking me, ‘Is it safe to travel to the Northeast?’ That kind of ignorance hurts me. For decades, the perception was that we lived in jungles. But I don’t want to solely blame filmmakers. The entire system is at fault.
What do you mean by the fault of the system?
To a large extent, political leaders—particularly from Assam and the Northeast—have allowed such ignorance to seep into society. For many decades, Indian history textbooks didn’t even include a chapter on the Northeast. Did our own leaders address this with the Central government? No. The Northeast has a rich, vibrant history. When society is ignorant about a region, it manifests everywhere, including in Bollywood. The Northeast may have been politically integrated into India, but social integration is still far from complete.
Why is Bollywood reluctant to explore the Northeast as a destination for film shoots, even though the insurgency has receded?
I believe there should be more films and series that feature Northeast themes and actors. The state governments in the region should encourage such initiatives.

Racing Ahead To Revolutionise Industries,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/racing-ahead-to-revolutionise-industries/articleshow/118011296.cms,07-02-2025,"The latest episode of Meet the Drapers in London showcased innovative ideas, featuring entrepreneurs seeking to transform AI, fintech, and mental health
Peter Szalontay Co-Founder & CEO, Lazy AI
The stage was set for an exciting display of innovation and entrepreneurial brilliance as Meet the Drapers brought together remarkable startups from across the globe. The venue this time was London. Tim Draper was joined by an impressive panel of jury members, including Harry Yeh, the driving force behind Quantum Fintech, Natalia Vodianova, the visionary Co-Founder of Locals.org, and Lord Aamer Sarfraz, a prominent member of the UK House of Lords. Together, they evaluated groundbreaking ideas ranging from game-changing AI tools to revolutionary solutions in mental health. Each pitch wasn’t just about business—it was about reimagining the future. The first presenter, Sumit Kishore, Founder of ActaLink, introduced a smart wallet powered by account abstraction. Designed to seamlessly bridge Web2 and Web3 payment systems, the wallet allows programmable automation of digital transactions. Sumit spoke about how this innovation could make Web3 payments as intuitive as using a traditional credit card. Peter Szalontay and Misha Lyalin, the brains behind Lazy AI, showcased their AI-powered platform that democratises software creation. With over 30,000 users already in their community, their goal is to make developing software as simple as writing text in natural language. By lowering costs and eliminating technical barriers, Lazy AI is positioned to transform industries reliant on rapid software development. Martin van der Heijden and José Martin Quesada (JJ), founders of Krew.build, pitched their AI co-pilot for private equity teams. Their tool streamlines data analysis and automates repetitive tasks, providing firms with more time to focus on strategic decision-making.
Misha Lyalin Co-Founder & CTO, Lazy AI
The duo highlighted how Krew.build could reduce operational bottlenecks in a sector traditionally dependent on manual processes. Soula Care, co-founded by Olga Ivanova, presented the company’s powerful mission to help women tackle mental health challenges. Ivanova, drawing from her own experience with burnout, created Soula Care to offer AI-driven support that’s not just about managing stress, but also about empowering women to build resilience and confidence. The platform is designed with a deep understanding of women’s needs, offering compassionate, personalised assistance. The jury had a tough decision, evaluating startups based on their market potential, execution, and the real-world problems they aimed to solve. While each company brought a unique vision, Lazy AI stood out for its ability to make software development more accessible through natural language. Its rapid adoption and strong community engagement highlighted its potential to reshape the industry, ultimately securing it a spot in the next stage. Peter Szalontay, co-founder & CEO of Lazy AI, said, “Imagine if a tool could drastically decrease costs while making development more accessible. Lazy AI empowers everyone to create software using our most innate skill—natural language.” Meet the Drapers continues to be a platform for innovators, offering them a stage to inspire and bring their vision to life.

Pushpa-2's record-smashing box office performance gives PVR Inox big profit boost in Q3,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pushpa-2s-record-smashing-box-office-performance-gives-pvr-inox-big-profit-boost-in-q3/articleshow/117978299.cms,06-02-2025,"PVR Inox
has reported an exceptional financial performance in the third quarter of FY 2024, largely driven by the unprecedented success of Pushpa 2. The film’s record-breaking box office numbers helped the multiplex giant achieve its highest earnings of the year.
Pushpa 2 not only smashed records but also contributed significantly to the company’s overall growth, making history as the biggest blockbuster ever in Indian cinema. The film accounted for a staggering 36% of PVR Inox's Q3 India box office collections and 12% of the overall India box office for CY 2024.
In December alone, Pushpa 2 grossed over Rs 1,450 crores in India, with its Hindi-dubbed version contributing a significant Rs 900 crores, setting a new benchmark as the
highest-grossing Hindi film
ever. The blockbuster's performance lifted the entire box office, despite challenges presented by the rescheduling of key films and other underperforming releases earlier in the quarter.
While Pushpa 2 undoubtedly stole the spotlight, regional cinema also played a crucial role in PVR Inox's strong Q3 performance. The continued success of South Indian films was evident in the quarter’s box office results, especially with hits like Devara Part-1 and Vettaiyan, which dominated October’s earnings. Their strong performance reflected the growing reach and popularity of Tamil and Telugu films beyond their traditional audiences.
Even mid-budget regional films saw success, with Lucky Baskhar earning around Rs 90 crores and the Tamil film Amaran surpassing Rs 250 crores, cementing its place as the second highest-grossing Tamil film of the year.
Live Events
In contrast, Bollywood struggled during the quarter, with Hindi and English films such as Jigra and Joker 2 failing to meet expectations.
Despite this, PVR Inox’s strong regional offerings and the spectacular success of Pushpa 2 provided the much-needed lift to the company's overall performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.
Commenting on the results, Mr. Ajay Kumar Bijli, Managing Director of PVR Inox, said, ""As we look ahead, our focus remains on pivoting to the capital light model, enhancing free cash generation, reducing net debt, controlling costs, and delivering a diverse slate of films that excite and inspire moviegoers. With a robust content pipeline, a slew of strategic growth initiatives, and continued financial discipline, we are confident in sustaining our leadership and driving long-term value for all stakeholders.""

Are South Indian films really the game changer they've been made out to be?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/are-south-indian-films-really-the-game-changer-theyve-been-made-out-to-be/articleshow/117959295.cms,06-02-2025,"Recent box office failures of high-budget southern films, such as Game Changer (Telugu), UI (Kannada), and Kanguva (Tamil), have put the belief to test that dubbed versions of regional films perennially dominate the Hindi film market. Producers and analysts are reassessing the narrative that southern cinema is consistently outpacing
Bollywood
. Industry watchers are now asking a critical question: Is regional cinema truly performing as well as perceived?
Key criteria such as
box office collections
, and footfalls, which capture the economics of films show that regional films--especially southern films--are not performing as good as Hindi audiences perceive them to do.
According to media and entertainment research firm Ormax Media’s Box Office Report: 2024, the performance of southern films is not significantly different from Hindi films. Box office collections of Tamil and
Kannada films
in 2024 have declined by 3-7% compared to 2023.
Meanwhile, Telugu films—often perceived as dominating the Hindi market through dubbed versions—have recorded only a modest 3.5% growth in collections.
Veteran filmmaker Vipul Amrutlal Shah, known for hits like Aankhen (2002) and Singh Is Kinng (2008), said, ""People focus on a limited number of southern hits and assume most are doing well. Ultimately, a film's story has to work, whether in its original language or dubbed.""
Live Events
Blockbusters? Hardly
Among southern films, select
Telugu films
dubbed in Hindi have managed to break out of their home markets and perform well in the Hindi film industry. However, in their home states, their success has relied more on ticket price hikes than audience turnout.
According to Ormax Media data, domestic footfalls for Telugu films have dropped by 13.6% to 21.3 crore in 2024, compared to 2023.
Tanuj Garg, managing partner, Ellipsis Entertainment, a production house, said, ""While I am hugely appreciative of Telugu cinema and their vision, conviction and scale, I think the media and trade circuit get carried away in claiming that they are ruling the Hindi film industry."" He added: ""The few dubbed Telugu films which have worked are an exception rather than a rule. What we in the rest of India never get to hear about is the ones that didn't work. This tendency to generalise and form trends is dangerous.""
Recently, a pan-India attempt Telugu Game Changer which is estimated to be made in the budget of Rs400-450 crore did not perform well at the box office as it has collected less than Rs150 crore since its release three weeks ago.
Ameya Naik, a producer and founder-Fantasy Films--an event management company, said, ""Selective and few successes of southern films which cross over their home states mask failures of a sufficiently large number of southern films in their home states."" The producer added, ""Even down the South, makers are facing similar challenges in terms of stars increasing their remuneration. What differentiates the southern market from Hindi is the loyalty of its audiences and daredevil and hands-on producers who work collaboratively based on their skills and competencies.""
In the southern markets, Malayalam films have been an exception. According to Ormax Media, box office collection of Malayalam films has grown by 104% to Rs1165 crore in 2024 compared to 2023. A producer who requested anonymity said, ""Unlike Kannada films, which are not working due to emergence of a cosmopolitan culture in Bangalore, Malayalam films which hardly cross over Kerala and are rooted in their culture are performing well in the state."" He added, ""In 2024, there were nine blockbusters in the Malayalam film industry compared to five in 2023.""
Increasingly, a key aspect which southern films share with Hindi films is the large contribution of their top ten films to their collections.

"Netflix bets big on India, unveils its biggest content slate for 2025",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/netflix-ups-investment-in-india-unveils-biggest-content-slate-for-2025/articleshow/117904519.cms,04-02-2025,"Netflix
continues to make heavy content investments in India and sees 2025 as its most expansive year in the country as it retains users and grows its subscriber base, said Monika Shergill, vice president of content.
Globally, Netflix has raised its annual content budget for 2025 to $18 billion from $17 billion, with co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently stating that the platform will offer its strongest programming lineup since it began producing original content.
Shergill, who has led Netflix India’s content strategy since 2019, outlined plans to expand original programming and film acquisitions.
The 2025 lineup includes 28 titles across Hindi and South originals, romantic comedies, crime and action, and returning seasons of major franchises. Outside the original programming, the slate also includes theatrical blockbusters like Pushpa 2.
""We are not changing our investment levels at all. In fact, we are doing several big things at a tentpole level,"" Shergill said in an interview, acknowledging an industry-wide slowdown in
OTT content spending

According to an Ormax Media report, the number of streaming originals declined to 315 in 2024 from a high of 383 in 2023.
""While there has been an external slowdown, I would say, in the interest of clarity and fairness, that as the market matures and streaming evolves, there is a natural right-sizing of budgets,"" she noted.
Shergill said 2025 will be Netflix India’s biggest year yet, following a strong 2024 marked by significant growth. She highlighted successful titles such as The Great Indian Kapil Show (two seasons), Heeramandi, Amar Singh Chamkila and IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack, among others.
Its 2025 slate includes high-profile productions like Jewel Thief: The Heist Begins, Akka and Aryan Khan’s Bollywood-themed series, alongside new seasons of The Great Indian Kapil Show, Khakee, Rana Naidu, Kohrra and Delhi Crime.
Netflix, which boasts a 15 million paid base, is also strengthening its south Indian slate with Test, a Tamil cricket drama, and Super Subbu, its first Telugu comedy-drama series. The platform will premiere theatrical films from leading studios such as Ajay Devgn Films, Dharma Productions, Luv Films, Maddock Films, Roy Kapur Films, Salman Khan’s SKF and T-Series.
According to Shergill, Netflix’s diverse content strategy aligns seamlessly with India’s varied audience, catering to different tastes and preferences.
WWE, a long-standing property on Ten Sports and Sony Sports in India, will debut on Netflix with Hindi commentary starting in April. This is part of Netflix’s global $5 billion acquisition of WWE rights, which Shergill hopes will help the platform expand its audience base in India.

"As heroes falter, producers take up the challenge for Bollywood",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/as-heroes-falter-producers-take-up-the-challenge-for-bollywood/articleshow/117798546.cms,31-01-2025,"Mumbai: At a time when confidence to finance fresh films is low and the pool of
film financing
has shrunk, the Hindi film industry is witnessing a gradual increase in
independent film producers
- without the backing of studios - who are collaborating based on their skills and core competencies to make films.
Hansal Mehta, known for films such as Shahid (2012), Citylights (2014) and Aligarh (2015), along with his partner Sahil Saigal, launched a production house -
True Story Films
. This production house has received investments from producers Vinod Bhanushali and Parag Sanghvi. Mantraa Luminosity, a film marketing and distribution company known for releases like Sulemani Keeda (2013) and La La Land (2016) as well as the marketing of Lakshmi (2014) in India, has now diversified into film production. The company launched a production house,
Mayavi Entertainment
, which is aiming to produce at least four films in 2025.
""The industry is going through an incredible shift as it is breaking long-standing patterns. A space is created for new voices to emerge, particularly independent producers who champion a culture of collaboration and teamwork,"" said Shikha Kapur, founder of Source Global, a content studio.
Echoing a similar sentiment, Rahul Merchant, managing partner of Mayavi Entertainment, said: ""Independent producers who are guided by passion and are open for skilful, strategic collaborations are needed more now than ever. We are seeing more independent producers collaborating with each other based on their synergies.""
Live Events
Producers seek funding through various routes. These include collaborating with studios, selling rights - digital, music, overseas dubbing and satellite - bank loans (interest rates are as high as 12%) and private financing (two times the bank rates). They also raise funds from long-term private equity investors by offering stakes in their production companies, wealthy individuals and even friends.
After the pandemic, independent producers suffered huge losses as the economics of making Hindi films changed significantly. But in recent years, two favourable developments have provided renewed confidence for them. One is the improving footfalls in theatres, as indicated by the huge success of the Hindi-dubbed Pushpa 2 and the performance of the Sky Force. The other development that these producers consider encouraging is streamers using box office performance as the sole yardstick to buy films.
""The sentiment in the industry is changing. Footfalls in theatres are improving. Recent films have shown reasonably good performance,"" producer and film business expert Girish Johar said. ""These facts have provided confidence to independent producers who are passionate about their stories to collaborate. I see more synergetic collaborations between independent producers.""
Sector experts are of the view that increasing collaborations among independent producers will start bearing fruit in terms of new releases in 2026 as films will go on the floors in 2025.
Karmic Films
cofounder and director Suniel Wadhwa said: ""This is an era of coexistence. Today, independent producers are no longer solely dependent on traditional studios to greenlight projects. With evolving audience preferences, new funding avenues, and technological advancements, independent producers are driving fresh narratives and innovative business models while still working alongside studios to maximise scale and reach.""
Even though the rise of independent producers is reshaping the industry, studios still remain an integral part of the production ecosystem, he added.
A studio makes four to five films a year in Hindi. Some 400-500 Hindi films are produced annually. This shows that there is tremendous potential for independent producers to collaborate and make films.

Number of original series released by streaming platforms in India is at a three-year low,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/number-of-original-series-released-by-streaming-platforms-in-india-is-at-a-four-year-low/articleshow/117737920.cms,30-01-2025,"The number of original series released in India by streaming platforms is at a three-year low, shows the data by media and entertainment research and consulting firm

The fall in the releases of originals in India is sharper when one considers the past one year period. Between 2023 and 2024, there has been a drop of 18% in the number of originals released by streamers in India.

Ameya Naik, producer and founder-Fantasy Films, an event management company said, ""The drop in the releases of originals in 2024 by streamers in India is largely connected with economics. Today, an original web series may take a year to make. Then, there are costs and time attached to it. For streamers, it makes sense to selectively buy more films than invest in originals.""
At present, it is estimated that there are more than 250 mid-budgets which are already made and yet to secure deals with streamers, point out trade analysts.
The research of Ormax Media notes, ""The drop of 18% in supply in 2024 can be attributed to reduction in number of originals on Prime Video, Ullu, Hoichoi, and
ALTT
(drop of more than 10 originals), followed by ZEE5, Disney+ Hotstar, Aha, Addatimes, and Discovery+ (drop of 5-9 originals).

The research by Ormax Media takes into account four formats of storytelling produced by streaming platforms in India. These categories are: fiction series, direct-to-OTT films, reality shows, and documentaries.
It has been observed that since 2022, fiction web series has been the dominant format of storytelling. The research observed that 70% of the content produced by streamers was largely fiction web series. In 2024, 214 shows of 315 originals released by streamers were fiction web series. In 2023, of the total originals of 383, the number of fiction web series were 272. This means that between 2023 and 2024, the number of original fiction web series released by streamers in India has declined by 21%.
In terms of content strategies pursued by streamers in India, the Ormax Media research notes that Amazon MX Player, Sony LIV, Disney+ Hotstar, Ullu, and Hungama Play focused largely on fiction series in Hindi. It noted that ZEE5 followed the strategy of releasing the highest number of direct-to-OTT films in India, prioritising the format over web-series. On the other hand, the research observed that streamers such as JioCinema, Netflix, and Prime Video struck a balance in content offerings across fiction series, direct-to-OTT films, reality shows, and documentaries.

Recalling the recent visit of the President of Indonesia to India, the Prime Minister said that the President's words that there were probably traces of Odisha in his DNA. He also mentioned Odisha's connect with South East Asia and the recent visit of President of Singapore to explore ways of promoting the heritage sector.
The ASEAN countries have also shown interest in strengthening trade and traditional connections with Odisha.
India also has great potential in Artificial Intelligence and in industries like food processing, petrochemicals, port-led development, fisheries, IT, edu-tech, textiles, tourism, mining, and green energy, the prime minister said.
Live Events
Modi, who met Punjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh weeks after his highly successful concert with Ed Sheeran, emphasized on the great possibilities in the ""concert economy"" where numerous avenues of earning money and job creation exist. ""With a vast pool of young talent and a massive audience for concerts, India has great possibilities for a thriving concert economy,"" the prime minister said.
Concert tours of various bands like Coldplay and CAS that have taken place or are scheduled for later this year. While Coldplay performed in Mumbai and Ahmedabad, Dosanjh even held concerts in non-metros like Lucknow.
The rich heritage of India in music, dance, and storytelling, and the large pool of young concert-goers shows the immense possibilities for concert economy, which has seen a spurt in the last decade where the trend and demand for live gigs has grown.
Modi underlined that concerts of Coldplay being held in cities like Ahmedabad is proof of the scope for
live concerts in India
. Prominent global artists are attracted to India today and the concert economy not only boosts tourism but also creates numerous jobs.
The prime minister insisted that the states and private sector should focus on developing the requisite infrastructure and skills for promoting the concert economy. This includes event management, artist grooming, security, and other arrangements, where new opportunities are emerging, he added.
Modi remarked that globally people are curious about India, its heritage and history. The unique attractive aspects are spirituality, the forests, mountains and seas and the impressive ancient temples and architecture.
In Odisha itself, apart from the famous Konark Sun Temple there is a 500-kilometre coastline, over 33% forest cover, and endless possibilities for eco-tourism and adventure tourism. India's focus is on 'Wed in India' and 'Heal in India' and Odisha's natural beauty and environment provide ample backing to these sectors, the prime minister said.
In the national capital, new centres like Bharat Mandapam and Yashobhoomi have become major centres for conference tourism, the prime minister maintained.
Modi remarked that in February, India will host the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) for the first time. Emphasising that this important event will display India's creative power to the world, he said such events generate revenue and shape perceptions, thus contributing to the growth of the economy.
WAVES will give a platform to amatuer digital music creators, fashionistas, advertising professionals, designers to showcase their talent.

Madras HC dismisses Netflix' plea against actor Dhanush in copyright infringement issue,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/madras-hc-dismisses-netflix-plea-against-actor-dhanush-in-copyright-infringement-issue/articleshow/117627628.cms,28-01-2025,"The
Madras High Court
on Tuesday dismissed an application filed by Los Gatos, an Indian entity of OTT platform Netflix, which sought to reject actor Dhanush's plaint over alleged copyright infringement by well-known actor
Nayanthara
, her husband Vignesh Sivan and others, at the preliminary stage itself.
Justice Abdul Quddhose
dismissed the application filed by Los Gatos and posted to February 5, further hearing of the application filed by Dhanush's production house Wunderbar, seeking interim injunction against Los Gatos and others.
In his application, Dhanush had submitted he produced a Tamil film ""Naanum Rowdy Daan"" a few years ago. Some of the behind-the-scene footage from the film were used unauthorizedly in the making of Nayanthara's documentary ""Nayanthara: Beyond the Fairytale"", he alleged. The documentary was aired on Netflix.
Dhanush said that since Netflix's office was in Mumbai, which was outside the jurisdiction of the Madras HC, he had moved an application seeking leave to sue the OTT player in this court, which was allowed. Aggrieved, Netflix filed the present application to revoke the order, granting leave to sue.
Netflix contended that the plaintiff in this case had obtained leave to sue only Los Gatos and because the office was situated outside the jurisdiction of this court. The plaintiff ought to have obtained leave against all the defendants, Netflix added.
Applications filed by Netflix seeking revocation of leave and rejection of plaint was dismissed by the High Court.

Netflix's contentions were that the suit ought to have been filed in Kancheepuram as plaintiff's registered office is situated there and leave was not specifically sought for that part of cause of action that arose outside of the Madras High court's jurisdiction. Thus it sought leave to be revoked.
Rejection of Plaint was sought for on the ground that there is no urgency as the documentary is already released. Therefore the plaintiff ought to have gone for mandatory pre suit mediation.
The High Court did not agree with the plaintiff and both the applications were dismissed.

"Disney+ Hotstar’s Coldplay concert live stream hits 83 Lakh views, 16.5 crore watch minutes",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/disney-hotstars-coldplay-concert-live-stream-hits-83-lakh-views-16-5-crore-watch-minutes/articleshow/117616267.cms,28-01-2025,"Disney+ Hotstar’s live stream of Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres World Tour concert in Ahmedabad garnered 83 lakh views and 16.5 crore minutes of watch time, the platform said in a statement.
It added that fans from across the country tuned in, with Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, NCR Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal contributing to 85% of the viewership.
Streaming live from Ahmedabad on 26 January 2025, Coldplay’s performance marked a key moment in India’s music and entertainment landscape.
The concert was brought to life through Disney+ Hotstar’s advanced streaming capabilities and immersive audio quality with Dolby 5.1.
Commenting on the success, Sanjog Gupta, CEO-Sports at JioStar, said, “At Disney+ Hotstar, we specialise in delivering compelling and immersive coverage of large-scale live events. We're continually striving to serve elevated experiences combining our strength in storytelling with the power of shared emotional connections. Coldplay Live is a perfect example of how we bring live entertainment and the power of unmissable, shared moments to millions across India.”

On achieving another feat, Kiran Mani, CEO-Digital at JioStar, said, “At Disney+ Hotstar, curating live-streaming experiences goes beyond business. Our unparalleled reach driven by our vision to empower audiences makes it imperative for us to deliver premium high-value entertainment experiences for our users. The response to Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres live stream is a testament to our commitment to democratising access to premium experiences, breaking barriers, and redefining how India is entertained.”

Disney+ Hotstar leveraged streaming features and a pre-live segment to create an interactive experience for viewers. The livestream offered a platform to reach audiences at scale.

A giant is waking: A plethora of problems persists even as intelligent Bengali cinema is starting to break its decades-long shackles,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/a-giant-is-waking-a-plethora-of-problems-persists-even-as-intelligent-bengali-cinema-is-starting-to-break-its-decades-long-shackles/articleshow/117560585.cms,26-01-2025,"The opening scene of
Anirban Bhattacharya
’s 2021 streaming series, Mandaar, sears itself in the viewer’s mind.
A drone shot tracks a dirt road leading up to a milestone identifying the location – Geilpur, a coastal fishing town in West Bengal. The next shot shows a fish flopping on the beach while a figure in the background seems to mimic the fish’s contortions, heralding this visually striking adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. It also sets the stage for a depiction of contemporary thuggery and violence in non-bhadralok Bengal, outside the bubble of Kolkata.
Kaushik Ganguly’s 2019 film, Nagarkirtan (Town Song) delves into the complex and complicated relationship that exists between gender and class. Exploring a transgender’s way of navigating a world that is neither urban nor urbane, Riddhi Sen as the protagonist puts up a sterling, nuanced performance that is brilliant in its subtlety.
Debaloy Bhattacharya’s 2024 film Shri Swapankumarer Badami Hyenar Kobole (Sri Swapan Kumar in the Grasp of the Brown Hyena) is a biting satire that not only upturns the ludicrousness of the Bengali action film genre, but also is a homage-cum-ironic take of the grand pulp fiction legacy of bestselling Bengali writer Swapankumar a.k.a. Samarendranath Pandey.
Bengali cinema
, written off for the last 30-odd years as being in terminal decline since the heydays of the trinity of Satyajit Ray-Ritwik Ghatak-Mrinal Sen, seems to be rearing its intelligent, sharp head to be taken note of. It is doing so at a time when cinema-goers have thinned out, preferring the comfort and non-hassle of the remote control at home.
Live Events
Films such Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee’s 2024 heist movie Bohurupi (Chameleon) and Soojit Rino Dutta’s 2024 action thriller Khadaan have been blockbusters, the latter becoming the fastest Bengali film to cross the Rs 5 crore mark in 5 days.
Quality Bengali films, in the minority even in its heydays in the 1960s-70s, punched above its weight. But even that critical mass was drowned out by terribly produced, formulaic films that producers put their money in for quick box office returns.
With the latter drying out – because of cinemas in money-strapped Bengal closing down as well as Hindi films upping their production quality and popularity among the ticket-buying masses – Bengali cinema’s reputation died a slow rear stall death.
But with OTT, the splutter of intelligent popular films – like the 2012 Bhooter Bhobishyot (Future of the Past, or Future of the Ghost), a trenchant comedy that showcases Kolkata living off its past and gives it a rip-roarious shake – is once again attaining a critical mass.
It may not yet be discernible outside the Bengaliphonic sphere, but within the Bengali cinema-watching and streaming show audience, people are sitting up.
Breaking Out
The return of good
Bengali movies
is despite the trying cinema ecosystem, not because it has had a change of direction.
Apart from Srijit Mukherji -- who is now the reigning name in middle-brow Bengali cinema, as well as director of crossover Hindi films like the 2017 Vidya Balan-starring Begum Jaan (a remake of his Bengali film Rajkahini) and co-director with Rohan Sippy of a desi take on Sherlock Holmes, the 2024 TV series starring Kay Kay Menon, Shekhar Home – Bengali cinema still languishes in the ‘glorious past’ for non-Bengali movie followers.
Director-actor Anirban Bhattacharya, explains this paucity, “Bengali audiences are not committed to their own language. It is a result of intellectual downfall in Bengal. It is a socio-political tragedy in every stream of Bengal: theatre, film, poetry, painting and music,” adding, “I am not blaming the audience…. The crisis is more in our own selves.”
“If you ask a person in Bengal about her favourite actor, then she will name Shah Rukh Khan or Ranbir Kapoor first and then a Bengali actor like, say, Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Abir Chatterjee. This is not the case in the south. There, a person will name Faahad Faasil or Allu Arjun first and then a Hindi actor,” he laments.
Southern films of the kind Bhattacharya cites, especially Malayalam and Tamil, have found a huge audience who do not speak or read these languages. That’s because of the ‘sincerity’ and ‘authenticity’ in their vision and storytelling.
Bengali cinema is gaining ground on this front. The story in films is once again becoming important. More energy is being given in writing them. The question is when there will be enough of this kind of cinema for the industry to make a reputational change, especially outside the Bengalisphere.
Shiboprosad Mukherjee, director of critically acclaimed films like the 2013 thriller Alik Shukh (Unreal Happiness) and 2019 Kontho (Voice), says, “A film has to be rooted in its language and culture. That is why Marathi films such as Sairaat and Natsamrat have worked beyond Maharashtra,” adding, “Today we need to make Bengali films with its culture intact.”
Films, like Indranil Roychowdhury’s 2013 Phoring (Dragonfly) on the relationship between a new school teacher and a boy in a town in North Bengal where the main industry has shut down, do mirror contemporary culture and politics.
Aniket Chattopadhyay’s 2019 movie Shankar Mudi (Shankar the Grocer) is a searing tale of how big retail and online shopping affects a kirana owner.
More and more films are depicting ‘reality,’ and importantly, telling stories in an intricate, engaging fashion bearing quality production.
The Search for Ideas
Producers are certainly looking out for more quality writers. Bengali streaming platform Hoichoi throw up a growing number of films and shows – including Mandaar and the other aforementioned films -- that are a visible improvement.
One can argue that this uptick is happening after the malaise was identified and called out. As Anirban Bhattacharya points out, “The Malayalam film industry is experimenting with films such as Bramayugam and Manjummel Boys. But in Bengal, there is no willingness or zeal to experiment with new themes.”
He adds, “there are filmmakers in Bengal who want to do everything with a reference point. They are using references from Mumbai or South Indian films and making movies. Bengali cinema has always been about ideas. If you want to explore an idea, you don't need a big budget for it. It is impossible to convince people that small ideas still can be as penetrating as big films.”
Market Matters
Cultural, creative and – perhaps, above all -- financial challenges exist. Lack of interest of streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video in Bengali films – perhaps emanating from the fact that a dedicated Bengali platform, Hoichoi, monopolises the content, economics of filmmaking, film exhibition and infrastructure – may be hobbling the industry.
Mahendra Soni, co-founder, SVF Entertainment, a leading production house and distributor in Kolkata, explains, “If I know about the existence of a film, then probably I will watch it. Some great films are being made every year in Bengal. They are not the talking points because there is no discovery of these films on international streaming platforms.”
Soni is also co-founder of Hoichoi. “Today, a large number of southern films are mostly discovered through these international streaming platforms. But these platforms are not picking Bengali films because they have not built this category on their platforms thoroughly.”
The limited reach of Bengali films is a chicken-and-egg conundrum: people are not betting on good Bengali films because they don’t know of their existence, while there is a shortage of good Bengali content because nobody is putting their money there.
Director Arin Paul, who made the 2008 comedy 10:10, points out, “In the South, a film is simultaneously released in more than two states apart from the home state. So, there are multiple markets to make good money. In Bengal, makers are largely dependent on the state itself for revenues. Even the budget of promoting Bengali films is very small.”
More than 80% of Bengali films are made within a budget of Rs 2 crore. Only films which boast of big names can have budgets of Rs 5-7 crore. But the additional cost of promotion -- between Rs 75 lakh and Rs 1.5 crore -- is pretty much that of making the film. As a result, films are hardly marketed after their release with no one outside West Bengal, even among the Bengali diaspora, getting to know about them.
This is something that OTT platforms like Hoichoi have started to rectify, especially since West Bengal has only 24 multiplexes -- Maharashtra has 200. Paucity of halls obviously have a bearing on box office receipts. West Bengal contributes only 7-8% of the total box office of Indian films.
Bengali film watchers are coming out of that moan-zone of ‘Oh, for the good old days’ as they are treated to better-made, better-told, better-shown movies and shows.
Your turn, rest of the world.

Section 6(2) of the Competition Act pertains to any person or enterprise to notify the CCI before entering into a combination, while Section 5(a) defines a combination as the acquisition of one or more enterprises, or the merger or amalgamation of enterprises that exceed a certain threshold.
Tata Play, (formerly Tata Sky), is one of India's leading content distribution platforms providing Pay TV and Over-the-top (OTT) services through Tata Play Binge, an OTT platform.
In its submission to the CCI for the assessment of the proposed transaction, the parties (Tata Sons and Tata Play) asserted that the transaction will not adversely affect competition in any plausible relevant markets.
Accordingly, the definition of the relevant market may remain open, the CCI may assess the transaction in the context of wired broadband internet services in India and the complementary link between internet access provided by Tata Sons through its affiliates and web-based services like Tata Play Binge, it added.

ZEEL files $8 million counterclaim against Star India in ICC TV rights dispute,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zeel-files-8-million-counterclaim-against-star-india-in-icc-tv-rights-dispute/articleshow/117490033.cms,23-01-2025,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
(
ZEEL
) has filed a counterclaim of $8 million, plus interest, against
Reliance Industries
Limited (RIL)-backed
Star India
. This follows Star's $940 million damages claim over the failed International Cricket Council (ICC) contract, which is currently under arbitration at the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA).
The counterclaim pertains to the Rs 69 crore that ZEEL had paid to Star under the terms of the agreement.
In a regulatory filing, ZEEL stated that arbitration is at an early stage, with the LCIA yet to determine ZEEL’s alleged liability for breaches of the Alliance Agreement with Star.
ZEEL submitted its statement of defence on 23 December 2024, refuting all claims made by Star. A three-member arbitral tribunal has been constituted by the LCIA to oversee the dispute. On 16 September 2024, Star filed its statement of case, including an expert report on damages and a witness statement.
The dispute arises from the Alliance Agreement signed on 26 August 2022, under which Star agreed to sub-license TV broadcasting rights for ICC men’s cricket events from 2024 to 2027 to ZEEL.
Live Events
Star, then wholly owned by Walt Disney, took over the
ICC media rights
valued at $3 billion after ZEEL withdrew from the agreement. Now majority owned by RIL, with
Walt Disney
and Bodhi Tree Systems as other shareholders, Star claims ZEEL failed to pay the first instalment of $203.56 million (Rs 1,693 crore) and cited additional obligations totalling Rs 17 crore for bank guarantee commission and deposit interest.
Star initiated arbitration proceedings in March 2024, seeking enforcement of the agreement or damages. In June 2024, Star terminated the agreement and focused solely on claiming damages. ZEEL, in turn, sought a refund of Rs 69 crore, arguing the agreement had become void due to Star’s failure to meet its obligations.
ZEEL said it is confident that the dispute will not significantly impact its operations or finances, citing the strength of its legal position.
The company's board continues to monitor the matter and believes the company has strong and valid grounds to defend any claims by Star, it added.
Previously, ZEEL had argued that the ICC agreement could not proceed due to unfulfilled conditions precedent, including financial commitments, guarantees, and ICC approval for the sub-licensing arrangement.
The ICC agreement was also impacted by ZEEL’s planned merger with
Sony Pictures Networks India
, which eventually fell through.
Star India, meanwhile, reported a standalone net loss of Rs 12,548 crore for the financial year ending 31 March 2024, primarily due to a Rs 12,319 crore provision for an ""onerous contract"" related to the ICC media rights deal, according to a regulatory filing.

. This follows the recent accreditation of Nielsen's integration of first-party live streaming data and the re-accreditation of its traditional Panel measurement. With this, Nielsen becomes the first accredited national
TV audience measurement
provider for Big Data + Panel.
“The accreditation of Nielsen’s Big Data + Panel is a landmark moment for TV ratings, as it will forever change audience measurement,” said Karthik Rao, Nielsen CEO. “No one else pairs a high-quality, representative panel with a data set this large, pulling from smart TVs and set-top boxes in more than 45 million homes. I believe Big Data + Panel gives the industry the most accurate measurement in the history of TV. We’re grateful to our clients for helping us innovate once again.”
George Ivie, CEO and Executive Director of the MRC, remarked, “MRC has completed and evaluated rigorous audits of Nielsen’s National Service and its new components, including first-party streaming (thus far consisting of select NFL games) and the integration of big data. We have now approved the integration of big data so this combined methodology can be considered MRC accredited. This effort marks the first time MRC has accredited a hybrid panel/big-data product inclusive of persons-level estimates.”
“The NFL continues to support Nielsen’s efforts to modernise measurement so we can all benefit from accurate insights in an increasingly fragmented media marketplace,” said Paul Ballew, Chief Data & Analytic Officer of the NFL. “The accreditation of their Big Data solution is a significant step in the journey, and we commend Nielsen for their efforts.”
Big Data + Panel National TV Measurement combines Nielsen’s high-quality, representative panel data with insights from cable and satellite set-top boxes and smart TVs across 45 million households and 75 million devices. This measurement fuels planning and cross-platform audience analysis in both Nielsen’s ecosystem and its partners’ systems.
Live Events
Beyond advertising, the solution supports content programming, licensing decisions, and TV distribution agreements. It was widely adopted by broadcasters and agencies for the 2024 Upfront season, with Nielsen endorsing its use as currency heading into 2025.
In addition to Big Data + Panel, Nielsen has expanded National TV out-of-home measurement, which is under review by the MRC. Nielsen also leads in streaming measurement with products like Streaming Content Ratings, powering Nielsen’s Streaming Top 10, and Streaming Platform Ratings, which inform The Gauge and Media Distributor Gauge.
For advertisers and agencies, Nielsen has expanded Nielsen ONE to include outcomes capabilities alongside advanced audiences, planning, and measurement tools. While Nielsen ONE is not currently submitted to MRC for accreditation, plans for evaluation are underway.

"Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar dominate India’s 2024 streaming charts",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/prime-video-netflix-disney-hotstar-dominate-indias-2024-streaming-charts/articleshow/117450919.cms,22-01-2025,"Prime Video
and Netflix topped India’s 15 most-viewed Hindi streaming shows in 2024, while Disney+ Hotstar led in Tamil and Telugu, according to Ormax Media’s ‘Streaming Originals in India - The 2024 Story’ report.
The report emphasised the dominance of platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar, which collectively have an estimated 70 million subscribers. It highlighted the growing role of regional content and franchise-driven formats in shaping India’s streaming landscape.
Netflix and Prime Video each had five entries in the top 15 Hindi streaming shows. Mirzapur Season 3 was the most-watched Hindi series with 30.8 million viewers, followed by Prime Video's Panchayat Season 3 (28.2 million) and Netflix’s Heeramandi (21.5 million). The viewership estimates were based on primary data, according to Ormax.
In the non-fiction OTT category, JioCinema's Bigg Boss OTT Season 3 led with 17.8 million viewers. Netflix’s The Great Indian Kapil Show Season 1 ranked second with 15.7 million viewers, while SonyLIV's Shark Tank India Season 3 secured 12.5 million viewers.
The report also highlights a wide variety of unscripted genres, spanning TV extensions, documentaries, game shows, and reality formats driven by influencers.
Live Events
Netflix also dominated Hindi direct-to-digital films claiming 11 of the top 15 spots, with Do Patti leading at 15.1 million viewers, followed by Sector 36 (13.9 million) and Sikandar Ka Muqaddar (13.5 million).
“Audiences today seek more choices—across stories, devices—and we’re here to meet that demand,” said Monika Shergill, Netflix India’s vice president, content. “The sheer convenience of streaming with improved accessibility and broadband and CTV market growth is leading to a revolution in how we consume our entertainment. Exceptional storytelling enhanced by quality subtitles and dubbing in several languages is enabling more stories to travel and be consumed by more audiences in India and around the globe.""
She further noted, “At Netflix, originals like Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, Amar Singh Chamkila, The Great Indian Kapil Show, and blockbuster movie slates in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu have demonstrated how entertainment and experience can together become the key drivers of streaming growth.”
Nikhil Madhok, Head of Originals, Prime Video India, stated that Indian audiences are open to good stories regardless of language, format, or genre. He highlighted Prime Video's success in engaging audiences across languages with titles like Mirzapur Season 3, Panchayat Season 3, Inspector Rishi, and global hits like The Boys and The Rings of Power.
""We are in a unique time, a renaissance in Indian entertainment, where all kinds of stories are being told and all genres are being explored on streaming. We will continue to collaborate with the finest creators and storytellers from India and around the world to offer our customers some of the most dynamic, fresh, out-of-the-box stories,"" he said.
Last year, Netflix and Prime Video unveiled ambitious content slates. Netflix’s 2024 slate included 14 shows and eight films, while Prime Video India announced plans to release 70 series and films over the next two years.
In regional content, Disney+ Hotstar's Save The Tigers Season 2 (5 million viewers) and Prime Video's Inspector Rishi (4.9 million viewers) were the top Telugu and Tamil shows, respectively. Disney+ Hotstar dominated the top 10 lists in both languages, with four Telugu and seven Tamil entries.
Netflix’s Squid Game Season 2 became the most-watched international show of 2024 with 19.6 million viewers, securing its place as India’s all-time leader. Among international films, Prime Video’s Road House led with 6 million viewers.
While the report excluded YouTube Originals, it acknowledged the success of India’s Got Latent on Samay Raina’s YouTube channel, which could have ranked in the top three.
According to Ormax, the report evaluated the top original shows and films released in 2024 in Hindi, International, Telugu, and Tamil across parameters such as viewership, marketing buzz, and content strength. It focused exclusively on original content, excluding theatrical films, catch-up TV, sports, and other non-original streaming content.

Will be first to go to theatre when Saathiya re-releases: Vivek Oberoi says at Davos,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/will-be-first-to-go-to-theatre-when-saathiya-re-releases-vivek-oberoi-says-at-davos/articleshow/117421191.cms,21-01-2025,"As re-releasing of movies has emerged as a new trend and draws audience, actor-entrepreneur
Vivek Oberoi
says he will be the first one to reach the theatre if his 2002 hit
Saathiya
is released again. Several movies in the recent past have come back to theatres, some regaining their old glory while some others have done a lot better than their first innings.
Oberoi made a hit debut with Ram Gopal Verma's gangster flick Company in 2002, but caught a lot more attention with
Rani Mukherjee
co-starrer romantic-drama Saathiya, which was released the same year and was directed by Shaad Ali.
Speaking to PTI here on the sidelines of the
World Economic Forum
Annual Meeting, Oberoi said he recently met legendary lyricist and writer
Gulzar
and told him that it was only because of his songs that people still associate and remember Vivek Oberoi the most for Saathiya.
""Those songs are timeless and wherever I go, people ask me about Saathiya,"" he said.
Asked whether a new season of his hit cricket web series 'Inside Edge' should be expected by the audience sometime soon, he said the makers and director should be asked that question.

PVR Inox launches new service to combat declining footfalls,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pvr-inox-launches-new-service-to-combat-declining-footfalls/articleshow/117412060.cms,21-01-2025,"Multiplex operator
PVR Inox
has introduced
ScreenIT
, a service available on its app aimed at addressing challenges such as
declining footfalls
, improving screen utilisation, and catering to audience preferences.
The move comes as multiplexes face reduced footfalls due to the rise of over-the-top (OTT) platforms and limited content diversity. ScreenIT offers a library of over 500 titles at launch, with plans to expand to more than 1,000. Ticket pricing will remain unchanged.
Renaud Palliere, CEO of The Luxury Collection and Innovation at PVR Inox, explained that ScreenIT allows audiences to select, schedule, and promote movies for screenings.
""There's no downside in this initiative. The only upside is to maximise and optimise admissions. It creates viral marketing opportunities for people to go and see content that they couldn’t necessarily see again on the big screen. They can design and customise the experience the way they want, and they can earn from it,"" he said.
According to
Ormax Media
, footfalls fell 6% year-on-year to 883 million in 2024, well below the pre-pandemic peak of 1.03 billion recorded in 2019. An increase in the average ticket price has partially offset losses from declining footfalls.
Live Events
The Hindi film industry has also been cautious about greenlighting projects due to box office flops in recent years. To compensate for a weak content pipeline, multiplexes like
PVR Inox
have turned to re-releasing old hits—a strategy that has shown positive results. In Q2, reruns accounted for 6% of PVR Inox's admissions.
""In the last eight to nine months, we've seen consistent behaviour from re-releases, where many have performed almost like a brand-new film,"" said Kamal Gianchandani, Chief of Business, Planning, and Strategy at PVR Inox, during the company’s Q2 earnings call.
Through the PVR Inox app, ScreenIT users can choose films spanning genres such as action, romance, and regional cinema. Once selected, users can schedule screenings by choosing the location, date, and time at any of the 120 screens across 50 cities in India.
To confirm a screening, at least 10% of the auditorium’s capacity must be filled. ""Let’s say the auditorium you’ve chosen has a 100-seat capacity. You’ll need to sell at least 10 tickets for the show to go ahead,"" Palliere explained.
ScreenIT also incentivises users to promote screenings not just in their social circle but also beyond it. For every ticket purchased via their promotional link, users earn a 5% cash reward.
Palliere believes this strategy not only drives admissions but also enhances customer loyalty. He likened the initiative to the circular economy model used by industries such as e-commerce and travel.
""I mean, it has delivered and yielded significant results in terms of utilisation. Whether it’s e-commerce or Airbnb, you can name many players in the circular economy. This is about turning the audience into brand ambassadors of the content they want to see and rewarding them for that,"" he added.

BBC Studios weighs exiting India content production business amid challenges,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bbc-studios-weighs-exiting-india-content-production-business-amid-challenges/articleshow/117378642.cms,20-01-2025,"BBC Studios
, a subsidiary of UK's BBC Group, is exploring options for its India content production business, including a potential exit, due to challenges like consolidation and shrinking content budgets from
TV broadcasters and OTT platforms
, multiple sources told ET.
Industry experts highlight that consolidation and reduced content budgets due to focus on profitability have intensified competition for fewer projects, squeezing content producers' margins.
BBC Studios India
has produced shows such as Criminal Justice, The Office, Out of Love, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, Nach Baliye, Rudra: The Edge of Darkness, Qayaamat Se Qayaamat Tak, and Sons of the Soil. Recently, Sameer Gogate stepped down as general manager of India Productions at BBC Studios.
Beyond production, BBC Studios has a thriving content licencing business in India, distributing British formats like Dancing with the Stars, The Office, Criminal Justice, Luther, and Press. It produces 2,000 hours of content annually, with offices in over 20 countries.
The BBC Group also owns TV and digital news platforms in India and runs Sony BBC Earth in a joint venture with Sony Pictures Networks India. In 2023, it launched BBC Player and BBC Kids on Prime Video.
Live Events
""BBC Studios plans to shut down its production business in India due to challenges in the broader M&E industry,"" a source said, requesting anonymity. ""OTT platforms and broadcasters are increasingly selective about greenlighting projects, while shrinking budgets is forcing producers to maximise output,"" the person added.
A BBC Studios spokesperson told ET, “We regularly review our business operations to ensure they are as efficient and effective as possible and are currently undertaking a review of our production operating model in India.”
The media and entertainment (M&E) industry has seen major mergers in recent years, putting pressure on content production and distribution businesses. Key deals include the Star India and Viacom18 merger into the $8.5 billion Jio Star, while the Sony Pictures Networks-Zee Entertainment merger fell through.
Bharti Airtel
’s DTH arm is also in talks with Tata Sons and Walt Disney to acquire Tata Play.
The head of a leading production company said consolidation on the content production side is inevitable due to margin pressures from cost-cutting and platform-side consolidation. ""BBC Studios' production business could well be the first victim of the consolidation wave in the M&E industry,"" the person added, requesting anonymity.

'Jai Shri Ram' and Jasprit Bumrah: Coldplay's Mumbai concert was a celebration of music and culture,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jai-shri-ram-and-jasprit-bumrah-coldplays-mumbai-concert-was-a-celebration-of-music-and-culture/articleshow/117367072.cms,19-01-2025,"From asking what 'Jai Shri Ram' means to giving a tongue-in-cheek shout-out to cricketer Jasprit Bumrah, Coldplay's first concert in India in nine years was nothing short of a cultural celebration where the band's frontman Chris Martin captivated the audience with his humour and curiosity. There were plenty of unforgettable moments that resonated deeply with fans at Navi Mumbai's DY Patil Stadium where Coldplay kick-started their '
Music of the Spheres World Tour
' in India.
For two hours at the packed stadium, Martin belted out chartbuster tracks like ""Paradise"", ""Viva La Vida"", ""Adventure of a Lifetime"", ""Yellow"", ""Fix You"", and ""A Sky Full of Stars"", among others.
One of the evening's most stand moments came when Martin noticed a fan holding a placard that read ""Jai Shri Ram."" Curious, he uttered the phrase, igniting thunderous cheers from the crowd.
He then said, ""What does Jai Shri Ram mean? Must be something good.""
Martin's innocent inquiry about the meaning of the phrase only heightened the audience's excitement.
Live Events
Throughout the evening, Martin made a concerted effort to connect with the audience in their native tongues. His attempts to speak Hindi and Marathi were met with overwhelming warmth.
At the beginning of the concert, he interacted with the crowd in Marathi, Hindi, and English.
He began by saying in Marathi, ""Tumhee saghre aaj chaan distat' (You all look beautiful today).
He then said in Hindi, ""Aap sab ka bahut swagat hai humare show pe. Mumbai mein aakar hume bahut khushi ho rahi hai. (You're all very welcome to our show. We feel happy after coming to Mumbai.)
""Sorry, my Hindi and Marathi are bad but I tried my best,"" he said, before switching to English.
The British musician thanked Indian fans for giving him the chance to play in one of ""our favourite places in the whole world"".
""This is our fourth visit to India, the second time playing, and the first time played our show, and we couldn't have asked for a better audience. It's amazing you welcome us,"" Martin said.
The singer-songwriter frequently checked on the crowd and made a point to ensure that they were well taken care of, asking about their well-being and hydration.
Looking at the various placards held by fans, he said, now is the good time to read some of the signs.
While reading placards by fans, such as 'Happy Birthday to you', 'Love to mom she is fighting cancer', 'I love Coldplay', 'Welcome from Calcutta', and 'I remember you from the Temple', Martin responded, 'Yes, I think so. I remember you. I went to some amazing places.'
He later invited a 15-year-old boy whose message read: 'Aum, I manifested this moment. I am ready for it. Can I sing 'Everglow' with you?'
Martin fulfilled the boy's wish as the two sang the track together. A few minutes later, while performing the song ""Alien"", Martin even invited a male security guard on stage, who danced his heart out.
The D Y Patil sports stadium, which is primarily a cricket stadium, though it is sometimes used for football, music concerts and other events, was glowing amidst the colourful lights courtesy of the recyclable light wristbands that all the attendees were wearing and the great firework displayed at the end of the concert.
At one point the fireworks didn't light up at the opportune time, and Martin said, 'It's taking a bit of time for it to get lit up. Can we all make firework sounds?'. The crowd followed him in unison till the skies were lit.
Towards the end of the concert, Martin stopped crooning and teased fans saying he needed to wrap it soon since it was time for Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah to play cricket at the stadium.
""We got to finish the show because Jasprit Bumrah wants to come and play cricket backstage. Thank you very much, everybody, good night. He says he needs to ball at me,"" he said leaving the crowd craving for some more songs.
""We love you Jasprit. So, we are going to ask him to wait for 15 minutes. So, we would like to play the song one more time, this time with four of us and the 60,000 of you all in the same breath,"" Martin added.
As part of their 'Music of the Spheres World Tour', the British band has two more shows at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday and Monday. A fourth show will be held at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium on January 25.
As the big day approached, fans started flocking from noon to attend the Coldplay concert, for which the gates opened at 3:30 pm and the band began at 8:00 pm.
One of the lady security guards said, ""We have been here since 10:00 am. We've been told to make sure everything goes smoothly since it's the biggest concert of the century.""
Indore-based Shivani Agarwal, who was seen wearing a sash with 'Bride To Be' printed on it, was thrilled to bits attending the concert.
""I've my bridesmaid here, I wanted it to be a concert theme. This concert seemed like the perfect treat for me and my friends,"" Agarwal told PTI.
Coldplay had earlier performed in the country in 2016 at the Global Citizen Festival in Mumbai.
The British rock band also includes guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer and percussionist Will Champion, and manager Phil Harvey.
A Bangalore-based man, who attended concert, said even though he barely knows a few songs of the band, he chose to fly to Mumbai as he didn't want to miss out on being part of the ""concert of a lifetime"".
A couple in the early 50s from Amritsar, who came with their two grown-up daughters described the concert as a ""glittering spectacle"".
Before Coldplay took on stage, there were performances by Shone, Elyanna and Jasleen Royal.

is the least popular activity among the
internet
users in the country, highlighted a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (

OTT industry must adopt diverse economic models for sustainability: Kiran Mani,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ott-industry-must-adopt-diverse-economic-models-for-sustainability-kiran-mani/articleshow/117308123.cms,16-01-2025,"The over-the-top (OTT) industry must develop multiple
economic models
beyond the traditional revenue streams of advertising and subscription to establish a sustainable business, said
Jio Star
CEO - Digital,
Kiran Mani
, during a fireside chat with
EY India
's Ashish Pherwani at the India Digital Summit.
""If you want to justify the economics of saying that I really want to do great storytelling, it has to follow more economic models. We have to ensure that it is sustainable for everyone in the ecosystem to do it,"" Mani emphasised, pointing out that relying solely on advertising as the primary business model is insufficient for building a sustainable OTT ecosystem.
Mani expressed optimism about both advertising and
subscription revenue
streams, highlighting the potential growth in India’s advertising market driven by strong economic tailwinds. At the same time, he noted that the true potential of the subscription market is yet to be unlocked.
To illustrate this, he shared a data point: while India has a 700-million OTT viewership base, the total number of subscriptions stands at just 60 to 70 million at the upper limit.
""I actually think one of the major issues with the subscriptions market in India is payment gateways. Because
payment gateways in India
are built for transactions, not for mandates,"" Mani said.

He highlighted the success of
Jio Cinema Premium
, which acquired 20 million subscribers in record time. This rapid growth was driven by its disruptive pricing strategy of Rs 29, bypassing middlemen and targeting consumers directly.
""A one-size-fits-all subscription saying that you can eat all the menu items, all the things in the buffet available for an X price, has a limitation,"" Mani remarked.
Drawing from his experience as a former Google executive, Mani said the traditional approach to advertising is ""archaic"" and overly reliant on gut instincts. He argued for a data-driven approach to consumer targeting, which is still in its early stages in India.
""As soon as that kicks in, you will realise that you are overspending money in cities and not in the smaller towns of India. So, as far as advertising growth goes, will it see continual growth and continual improvement and continued informed judgement-making? Absolutely,"" he said.
Mani further noted that, similar to subscriptions, a one-size-fits-all approach is ineffective in advertising. He pointed out the limitations of platforms that focus solely on brand advertising.
""I think what we are very excited to offer to our advertisers is that we are now coming back and saying that, yes, we are a mass reach platform and we will always get you the reach. We are also a premium reach platform,"" he stated.
Jio Star, the entity formed after the merger of Star India and Viacom18, is most excited about connectivity and creativity coming together in formats that have never happened before, creating unlimited possibilities, Mani said.

Building The Blocks of a Decentralized Future,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/building-the-blocks-of-a-decentralized-future/articleshow/117289496.cms,16-01-2025,"Four visionary entrepreneurs are seeking to redefine the future of blockchain. At a Paris conference, their innovation took centre stage.
The Paris Blockchain Conference set the perfect stage for Meet the Drapers, a global competition showcasing entrepreneurs vying to transform industries with blockchain-based solutions. Hosted by Tim Draper, Founder of Draper Associates, this riveting episode featured two extraordinary guest judges: Bundeep Singh Rangar, Co-founder and GP of Glass Ventures, and Gaurav Dubey, CEO of TDEFI. Together, they evaluated four standout founders, each with a bold vision to revolutionise the crypto and Web3 space. Decentralised finance, also referred to as DeFi, is an emerging peer-to-peer system attempting to remove third parties and centralised institutions from financial transactions. The elements of DeFi includes cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and software that allows people to engage with each other financially.
THE PIONEERS OF CHANGE
Former reggae artist Adrien Stern, CEO of Reveel, has turned into the founder of a tech firm. His company aims to simplify cross-border transactions using blockchain. It offers instant settlements across jurisdictions. While the judges appreciated the idea’s profitability, they acknowledged the steep competition in the payments sector. The Bitstack app, introduced by CEO Alexandre Roubaud, allows users to save and invest in Bitcoin effortlessly by rounding up everyday purchases. With a clear focus on democratising crypto investing, Bitstack boasts over 50 percent first-time crypto investors. The judges appeared to be impressed by its customer-centric approach but there were questions about its scalability and business model. Faraj Abutalibov, CEO of CrossCurve, caught the attention with his cross-chain protocol solving liquidity fragmentation in decentralised finance (DeFi). Faraj’s resilience, ambition, and vision to institutionalise the DeFi space earned him high praise from the jury. The judges lauded CrossCurve’s potential to become a decacorn, given its alignment with the fastest-growing sectors in crypto. Gauthier Vila, CEO of Zyfi, showcased a Paymaster SDK to abstract gas fees for on-chain users, aiming to enhance blockchain usability. While the innovation was deemed crucial, the judges highlighted the importance of focused execution within Ethereum’s vast ecosystem. The competition was tough, given the opportunities that could open up with decentralisation of finance. After intense deliberation, CrossCurve turned out to the company which the jury members decided should go ahead. The mission of the company to mature the DeFi space and build a foundational crypto enterprise resonated deeply with them. Jury member Gaurav Dubey remarked, “CrossCurve deserves a bigger success, addressing critical industry challenges with a scalable solution.” As the dreams of Faraj Abutalibov advances to the semi-finals in Silicon Valley, his journey is a proof of the resilience, vision, and innovation driving the blockchain revolution.

Ministry of Information and Broadcasting all set to roll out online LCO registration,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ministry-of-information-and-broadcasting-all-set-to-roll-out-online-lco-registration/articleshow/117276644.cms,16-01-2025,"The
ministry of information and broadcasting
(MIB) is set to launch a centralised online registration system for
local cable operators
(LCOs) that will also extend the registration validity from one year to five years to enhance ease of business in the
cable TV sector
, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The ministry plans to amend the Cable Television Networks (CTN) Rules, 1994, making it mandatory for LCOs to register through the
Broadcast Seva portal
. Once implemented, MIB will become the primary registering authority for LCOs.
Currently, LCOs must register at local head post offices within their operational areas. As per January 2022 data from the Department of Posts, 81,706 LCOs operate across the country.
“The ministry is likely to notify the new online registration system this week. It has been a long-standing demand of the industry,” said a government official on the condition of anonymity.
At present, the offline registration process prevents the ministry from maintaining a central database, which limits its ability to act against LCOs in case of violations. LCOs currently pay a one-time processing fee of ₹500 for registration or renewal.
Live Events
Under Rule 5 of the CTN Rules, 1994, LCOs provide last-mile connectivity by retransmitting signals from multi-system operators (MSOs) to subscribers through their own infrastructure.
The
All India Digital Cable Federation
(AIDCF), representing national MSOs, had informed the Parliamentary Committee on Communications and Information Technology that approximately 3 lakh employees lost their jobs over the past four years, with another 3 lakh at risk of losing employment due to a sharp decline in the
cable TV subscriber base
.
According to a FICCI-EY report, the cable TV subscriber base has dropped from 72 million in 2020 to 62 million in 2023.

"Cricket paywall, consolidation to drive subscription video on demand market in 2025",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/cricket-paywall-consolidation-to-drive-subscription-video-on-demand-market-in-2025/articleshow/117275746.cms,16-01-2025,"India’s subscription video on demand (SVOD) market, which rebounded to 125 million subscriptions in 2024 after a temporary dip in 2023, is set for strong growth in 2025 driven by industry consolidation, including the merger of Star India and Viacom18, and increased efforts by premium platforms to expand in smaller towns, said industry experts.
A key growth catalyst could also be cricket moving behind a paywall, as it remains the primary driver of subscriptions, they said. If implemented, this shift could trigger a ripple effect across the over-the-top (OTT) segment, significantly boosting the SVOD base and encouraging deeper adoption of paid streaming services across diverse demographics.
For the past two years, live sports have been offered for free, but according to industry insiders, this strategy could see a change as
Jio Star
explores new subscription models for entertainment and sports content. Significantly, live sports included advertisements even when it was behind the paywall.
According to Media Partners Asia, the total SVOD subscriptions in the country dropped to 110 million in 2023 from 112 million in 2022, before sprinting to 125 million in 2024.
Ashish Pherwani, EY India media and entertainment leader, said SVOD continues to grow on the back of innovations in pricing, bundling, multi-language pan-India content fuelled by connected TV growth. “We expect SVOD revenues to grow over 10% in 2024 and continue to grow at that rate for the next three years,” he said.

In 2023, the broader SVOD market saw a temporary slowdown, largely due to the widespread availability of free live sports and the decline in Disney+ Hotstar's base following the loss of Indian Premier League (IPL) streaming rights and HBO content to JioCinema.
“The SVOD market rebounded in 2024, reaching 125 million subscriptions after a slight dip in 2023. Paid subscriptions are expected to more than double over the next five years, fuelled by strong investments in local content and the introduction of low-cost, ad-supported tiers,"" said MPA vice-president Mihir Shah.
After becoming part of Viacom18 in 2022, JioCinema pursued an aggressive market capture strategy, offering premium content, including live sports, for free. With Viacom18 merging into Star India through a joint venture involving
Reliance Industries
, Walt Disney and Bodhi Tree Systems, this strategy seems poised for a change.
""The SVOD base in India grew in 2024, driven by JioCinema's push toward subscriptions and ongoing efforts by Netflix and Prime Video. This base is expected to surge further if premium content, including live sports, shifts to the subscription model. Additionally, the launch of Jio Star could provide a significant boost to SVOD growth,"" said PwC India media advisor Rajesh Sethi.
Last year, JioCinema launched its SVOD service, JioCinema Premium, providing a mix of Indian and international entertainment at introductory rates of Rs 29 per month for a single device and Rs 89 per month for up to four devices. The premium service quickly amassed more than 15 million paying subscribers in just 100 days.
According to The Ormax OTT Audience Report 2024, which surveyed 12,000 users, India’s OTT audience increased 14% year-on-year, reaching 547.3 million users by the end of 2024, representing a penetration rate of 38.4%.
Industry executives suggested that Disney+ Hotstar is likely to remain the flagship platform post-merger, with JioCinema being absorbed into it. However, in a recent interview with ET, Uday Shankar, vice-chairman of Jio Star, said that the company was still weighing its options between maintaining separate platforms and merging them into a unified service.
Disney+ Hotstar leads the streaming market with 36 million subscribers. According to industry estimates, JioCinema has garnered 25 million subscribers while Prime Video and Netflix hold 20 million and 15 million subscribers, respectively.

NDTV loan-repayment case: Complainant expresses satisfaction with CBI's closure report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ndtv-loan-repayment-case-complainant-expresses-satisfaction-with-cbis-closure-report/articleshow/117270577.cms,15-01-2025,"New Delhi: The complainant in the
NDTV
case, who had alleged irregularities by the
ICICI Bank
in accepting loan repayment from the media house, has accepted the
CBI closure report
and expressed satisfaction over the agency's probe, which did not find any collusion, criminal conspiracy or abuse of position in the matter. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed the closure report before a special court last year, after its six-year-long probe did not find any irregularities in the transactions between the ICICI Bank and NDTV promoters Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy.
The case was lodged on a complaint from Sanjay Dutt of Quantum Securities Limited, who had alleged that the ICICI Bank had sanctioned a loan of Rs 375 crore in 2008 against the entire 61 per cent shareholding of the NDTV promoters as collateral.
""The statement of the complainant (Sanjay Dutt) has been recorded to the effect that he does not want to file any protest petition against the closure report filed by the CBI as he is satisfied with the investigation,"" the court noted in a recent order.
The court will now decide whether to accept the closure report or order further investigation in the matter, officials said.
There was no collusion, criminal conspiracy or abuse of position by officials of the ICICI Bank in accepting repayment of a loan at a reduced rate of interest from Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy, the CBI had concluded in its closure report.

In 2022, the Adani Group acquired a controlling stake in NDTV, purchasing shares from the Roys at a premium of nearly 17 per cent over the price paid to the minority shareholders.
The CBI, which filed its closure report in October last year, also said that the reduction of the rate of interest for NDTV was not a ""one-off incident"". The repayment of the loan at the reduced interest rate was ""higher than the average cost of funds"", the federal agency said.
The CBI also found a forensic audit of the case conducted by Pramod Kumar and Associates, which described the repayment as a ""normal business transaction and closure of loan"", with no violation of the Banking Regulation Act.

Dare to watch! Bollywood bets on horror to pull in audience,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/dare-to-watch-bollywood-bets-on-horror-to-pull-in-audience/articleshow/117245353.cms,15-01-2025,"Mumbai: Production and distribution company
Panorama Studios
will remake Turkish film Dabbe in Hindi, as the production and distribution house known for movies such as Drishyam, Raid and Shaitaan prepares to create a full-fledged horror film franchise.
""The Turkish horror film Dabbe has a gripping narrative and cultural nuances that make its horror deeply unsettling,"" said Panorama Studios chairman Kumar Mangat Pathak. ""We saw an opportunity to adapt its unique storytelling to connect with Indian audiences while preserving the essence of what made it so impactful.""
The company will create a horror cinematic universe that will deal with a combination of horror and black magic themes, he said.
Panorama Studios will be the second production company to create a franchise specifically dedicated to the horror genre in India. Recently, Maddock Films - known for producing one of the biggest blockbusters in Hindi, Stree 2 - announced a slate of eight new films which will be expanding its well-established horror movie series such as Stree, Munjya and Bhediya in the next three years.
Live Events
Apart from the Dabbe remake, Panorama Studios plans to build a franchise of the movie Shaitaan, which will include two additional films. It also plans to remake Shaitaan in Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam. Recently, the studio announced a horror comedy film, Jhalak.
""Audience for
horror films in India
is quite large. The appetite for these films is very high. Importantly, the theme pulls audiences to theatres. But very few horror films are being made in Hindi,"" said producer Rajesh Nair, known for films such as Kaminey and Adipurush.
""A horror film works well if it gets the three elements right: good writing, thrills and, of course, the horror in the film. A clear example is the film Munjya, which had no stars or known faces. It worked on the power of its storytelling,"" he said, adding: ""These are actually grandmother tales, which never fail in their charm and pull. Problems arise when makers focus away from writing and try to make 'projects' out of these films by making them bigger in scale.""
It is estimated that a horror film combined with different genres such as comedy, drama and thriller generally attracts at least 25% higher footfalls in theatres than a non-horror film. Also, a concept-based horror movie does not entail high investments like a spectacle or epic film.
""The horror genre is the most profitable across languages not only in India but also Hollywood. In fact, Blumhouse Productions in Hollywood is an entire production house dedicated to horror films,"" said producer and film business expert Girish Johar. ""I think horror films will revive the sentiment in the industry which is in doldrums right now.""
Last year, the theme of horror ruled not only the Hindi box office but also in the southern markets. In Hindi, films such as Stree 2, Shaitaan, Munjya and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 performed well, while Bramayugam and Aranmanai 4 recorded high collections in the South. Interestingly, the re-released horror film Tumbbad (2018) collected ₹52.2 crore at the box office. The horror genre has caught on so well in the Indian film industry that makers are experimenting with it by combining it with different genres. Recently, a sea-horror action-adventure trilogy called Kingston was announced, which will be released in Telugu and Hindi in March this year.

Mukundan took to his Instagram account to share a note in which he explained that increasing work commitments had taken a toll on his ""
mental health
."" However, he assured that he would continue in the role until a replacement is found to ensure a smooth transition.
""I hope this message finds you well. After much thought and reflection, I have made the difficult decision to step down from my role as the Treasurer of AMMA,"" he wrote.
Sharing that his ongoing projects, ""particularly"" Marco, have made it difficult for him to balance his professional responsibilities and his role at AMMA, the actor wrote, ""I have truly enjoyed my time in this position, and it has been both an exciting and rewarding experience. However, in recent months, the increasing demands of my work, particularly with Marco and other production commitments, have significantly impacted my mental health. Balancing these responsibilities, along with the pressures of my professional life, has become overwhelming. I now realize the importance of stepping back to focus on my own well-being and that of my family,""
""While I have always given my best in serving this role, I recognize that I can no longer fulfill my duties effectively given the growing commitments ahead.

The announcement comes amid earlier controversies surrounding AMMA.

The allegations were revealed in the Justice K Hema Committee's report on the working conditions of women in Mollywood.

GTPL Hathway spends Rs 265 crore on capex in 9 months FY25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/gtpl-hathway-spends-rs-265-crore-on-capex-in-9-months-fy25/articleshow/117213513.cms,13-01-2025,"Reliance Industries-backed
GTPL Hathway
invested Rs 265 crore of the planned annual
capital expenditure
of Rs 350 crore in its cable TV and broadband businesses during the first nine months of this financial year, said the company's chief strategy officer, Piyush Pankaj.
Of the Rs 265 crore, the company invested Rs 160 crore in the
cable TV business
and Rs 95 crore in the broadband business during the period, Pankaj told analysts during the company's third-quarter earnings call on January 10.
“In cable TV, the main capex was spent on
set-top boxes
. So, out of Rs 160 crore, you can say around 90% is on the cable boxes. The rest is on fibre,” Pankaj said.
GTPL Hathway is India’s largest cable TV company, with 8.9 million paying subscribers. It also has over a million broadband customers. For the nine months ending December 31, 2024, the company's net profit fell 60% year-on-year to Rs 38 crore, while revenue increased 8% to Rs 2,586 crore.
In 2023, the company had announced a capex of Rs 1,400 crore over the next three years, Rs 450-500 crore each year, divided equally between the cable TV and broadband businesses.
Live Events
Pankaj said the soon-to-launch headend in the sky (HITS) business was 80% complete on the capex side. The company is awaiting some final approvals from the government before rolling out the HITS service. ""By next quarter, the whole project (HITS) will be completed, and we will be ready to launch,"" he said.
GTPL Hathway, which received the HITS licence from the information and broadcasting ministry in July, intends to invest Rs 100 crore in the project, people familiar with the matter had earlier told ET.
The company intends to acquire customers in
cable dark areas
of the country, particularly in northern India, through HITS, which is a satellite-based platform that combines the features of cable TV and DTH..
GTPL Buzz, the company's entertainment app, which offers cloud gaming, live TV streaming and international content, has reached a subscriber base of one million, Pankaj said.

"Jio Star targets Rs 6,000 crore from Champions Trophy, IPL",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jio-star-targets-rs-6000-crore-from-champions-trophy-ipl/articleshow/117179877.cms,13-01-2025,"Jio Star
is aiming to generate ad revenue of up to ₹6,000 crore from both TV and
digital platforms
during the upcoming ICC
Champions Trophy
and Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The broadcaster expects to secure ad revenue of up to ₹1,500 crore from the Champions Trophy and up to ₹4,500 crore from the IPL, the sources added. Rate cards for the ICC Champions Trophy have already been released, with a detailed ad rate card for IPL expected to follow shortly.
Jio Star’s ad sales team is actively negotiating with advertisers for both events, prioritising the sale of Champions Trophy inventory first. The tournament is set to run from February 19 to March 9.
IPL 2025
will be played from March 23 to May 25.
For the Champions Trophy on Star Sports, the broadcaster is seeking ₹55 crore for co-presenting sponsorship, ₹44 crore for associate
sponsorship
and ₹28 crore from partner sponsors. The TV spot rate for
India matches
is ₹28 lakh per 10-second spot.
On digital platforms, Jio Star is seeking ₹55 crore from co-presenting sponsors, ₹45 crore from powered-by sponsors and ₹25 crore from associate sponsors. CPM rates for the full tournament are ₹250 per 10-second spot and ₹500 for India matches. For Connected TV (CTV), the spot rate is ₹7 lakh for the entire tournament and ₹15 lakh for India and play-off matches.
Live Events
""Jio Star's ad revenue targets seem ambitious amid the current slowdown in the ad market, which will ultimately depend on overall demand. That said, certain sectors like financial services and auto show promising growth prospects. On the other hand, FMCG, the largest contributor to TV ad spending, is yet to recover its past momentum in ad expenditures,"" said IPG Mediabrands chief investment officer Hema Malik.
For IPL 2024, Disney Star had set ₹167 crore for co-presenting and ₹83 crore for associate sponsorships on SD channels and ₹71 crore and ₹35 crore on HD channels. Spot rates were ₹12.8 lakh (SD) and ₹5.45 lakh (HD) per 10-second spot. JioCinema’s mobile CPM was ₹200, with FCT rates at ₹16 lakh (mobile) and ₹6.5 lakh (CTV).
An ad industry source said the IPL ad rate increase could be in the 15-20% range.
Prior to the merger, the IPL media rights were shared between Disney Star and Viacom18.
Industry insiders note that recent cricket series, such as the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, experienced strong ad demand despite being a Test series. ""Both the Champions Trophy and IPL are expected to attract significant ad revenue, with many sectors eager to invest in proven properties like cricket,"" said one media executive, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Sectors such as startups, automobiles, beverages, consumer appliances and FMCG have shown strong interest in advertising on cricket, according to another executive.
The Champions Trophy will be the first major cricket property sold jointly by Jio Star’s ad sales team following the merger of Star India and Viacom18. Jio Star, backed by
Reliance Industries
, counts Walt Disney and Bodhi Tree Systems among its key shareholders.
Jio Star declined to comment on the matter.
The merged entity now controls key TV and streaming brands, including Star Sports, Sports18, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.
According to another source, the company is likely to broadcast and stream the matches on Star Sports and Disney+ Hotstar. While Star Sports has a wider reach than Sports18, Disney+ Hotstar offers superior technology compared to JioCinema, despite the narrowing gap in user base between the two platforms.
As previously reported, the merged entity is expected to retain Disney+ Hotstar as its primary streaming platform, with JioCinema likely to be integrated into Disney+ Hotstar.
In a recent interaction with ET, Jio Star vice-chairman Uday Shankar indicated that the company is weighing both options: retaining both streaming platforms or combining them into a single entity.

"Pushpa blooms again, but takings for 2024 wilt a bit",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pushpa-blooms-again-but-takings-for-2024-wilt-a-bit/articleshow/117156257.cms,12-01-2025,"Indian cinema’s box office receipts totalled Rs 11,833 crore in 2024, marking the second-highest collection after hitting a record in the previous year, according to Ormax Media's annual box office report.
Box office receipts declined 3.21% from Rs 12,226 crore in 2023, while footfall fell a steeper 6% year-on-year to 883 million, well below the pre-pandemic peak footfall of over 1 billion recorded in 2019, indicating increased dependence on average ticket price (ATP), which went up 3% to reach a historic high of Rs 134.
Kannada and Telugu films saw ATP hikes owing to government cess and premium pricing, while Hollywood and Hindi films recorded the highest ATP of Rs 245 and Rs 203, respectively.
Sanket Kulkarni, head of business development (theatrical) at Ormax, saw the trend of relying on higher ticket prices rather than increased footfalls to drive box office revenue continuing, signalling that cinema-going is increasingly becoming an event-driven activity, rather than a habit, especially for Hindi films.
“Release schedule optimisation, better supply of films, understanding the changing taste of the audiences and strategic utilisation of franchises would be the key for maximising box office collections in 2025,” he said.
Live Events
Hindi cinema faced a tough year, with collection falling
13%
year-on-year to Rs 4,679 crore, reducing its share by four percentage points to 40%. Despite hits such as Pushpa 2: The Rule (Hindi) and Stree 2, only six original Hindi films crossed receipts of Rs 100 crore each, compared to 16 in 2023.
Shift in Audience Preferences
Notably, 31% of Hindi cinema’s revenue came from dubbed south Indian films, and collection from original Hindi films fell 37% on-year. Footfall declined 16% to 230 million, significantly below the pre-pandemic levels of more than 300 million.
Experts said that despite declining footfall, Indian cinema showed resilience in 2024, with revenue driven largely by a few blockbusters. They highlighted significant growth in regional cinema, suggesting a shift in audience preferences, even as they cautioned that sustaining engagement would remain a key challenge.
“Though there has been a decline in terms of footfall, 2024 has been a year of tentpole movies and amongst them, Pushpa 2 turned out to be the biggest, holding the pole position of the highest grosser in Indian cinema, beating Bahubali 2's record by collecting Rs 1,200-plus crore,” said Nitin Menon, managing partner of NV Capital. “Though the overall box office collection is similar to 2023’s, the worry is footfall, which is below pre-pandemic levels. High ticket prices, shorter OTT (over-the-top) windows and a lack of good content continue to be large factors in the dipping occupancy levels.”
Karan Taurani, senior vice-president at
Elara Capital
, said regional film markets continued to thrive, while the Hindi film industry faced challenges. “I wouldn’t be surprised if box office collection drops by 20% in 2025, especially if Hollywood films underperform. The decline in footfall has become a persistent issue and rising average ticket prices are insufficient to offset the losses,” he said.
Regional Touch
Malayalam cinema had its best year yet, with box office revenue surging 104% from the previous year to Rs 1,165 crore, doubling its share to 10%. Footfall increased 88% to 12.6 crore, driven by hits such as Manjummel Boys and Aavesham, which performed well even outside Kerala.
Telugu cinema set a record with Rs 2,348 crore in box office revenue, up 4% from the year ago, though footfall dropped 12% to 213 million. This marked the third consecutive year that Telugu cinema exceeded Rs 2,000 crore, led by Pushpa 2 and Kalki 2898 AD.
Tamil cinema recorded box office receipts of Rs 1,829 crore, a 7% decline but its second-best year overall. Footfall fell below 200 million, though mid-range films gained prominence.
Collectively, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films accounted for 85% of total box office collection. Apart from Telugu, Malayalam, Gujarati and Bengali, films of all other languages saw a decline.
Gujarati box office revenue swelled 66% to Rs 84 crore, with footfall increasing 57%, led by Jhamkudi. Bengali cinema recorded 4% growth, reaching Rs 68 crore.
Hollywood revenue shrank 17% to Rs 941 crore, falling below Rs 1,000 crore for the first time since 2015, excluding the pandemic-affected years of 2020 and 2021, with footfall down to 38 million.
The biggest hit of the year was Pushpa 2: The Rule, grossing Rs 1,403 crore, including Rs 889 crore from its Hindi version. Other major blockbusters included Kalki 2898 AD (Rs 776 crore), Stree 2 (Rs 698 crore) and Devara – Part 1 (Rs 347 crore).
“Looking at the future, the era of tentpole movies that are looking at hitting the Rs 500 crore mark, whether Hindi or regional, will continue to gather steam and their number will only increase in the future since only these movies, combined with the sleeper hits, can provide the impetus to usher in the footfall that the theatres badly need,” said Menon.

A falling note: Has Chennai's celebrated music season caught a chill?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/a-falling-note-has-chennais-celebrated-music-season-caught-a-chill/articleshow/117154720.cms,12-01-2025,"Every city has a season. New York has fall. Tokyo has spring. Chennai has music. It is probably the only metropolis to have a month-long season of ragas. The Tamil month of Margazhi, from mid-December to mid-January, is when Chennai moves to a different talam. It woke up to
TM Krishna
singing Swathi Thirunal’s “Pankaja Lochana” in Raga Kalyani and Perumal Murugan’s freedom song on Christmas morning. It sat rapt listening to Sanjay Subrahmanyan’s “Sri Subramanyaya Namaste” in breathtaking Kambhoji, and Vishakha Hari’s “Andavane” in Shanmukhapriya.
The Margazhi festival has been around for almost a century. It began with the founding of the Music Academy in 1928, celebrating, in particular, Carnatic music and Bharatnatyam.
But is there a chill in the sabhas — the cultural organisations that are the force behind and the venue of concerts or kutcheris — this season? From insiders to hoteliers, many complain of a drop in the footfall of
rasikas
or connoisseurs. And yet a few others resist that narrative and say fans are flocking in and the festival is, indeed, on song.
MISSING RASIKAS
“There has been an almost 20% drop in footfall in kutcheris this year,” says a sabha insider and industry watcher, who does not want to be named. “Ticket sales have plummeted across the board this year. There are multiple reasons for this. For one, sabhas are livestreaming performances, which leaves very little incentive for people to attend a kutcheri in person as they are content listening to it on YouTube for free.” Tickets often cost between Rs 100 and Rs 750, with some artists charging as much as Rs 3,500 for VIP seating. Meanwhile, numerous singers perform for free.
Star performers like Krishna — who returned triumphantly to the Music Academy, after a decade of cold war, to receive the Sangita Kalanidhi MS Subbulakshmi Award — and his bete noire in the controversy, the vocal duo
Ranjani-Gayatri
, sang to packed halls. As did Hari and Subrahmanyan. However, several artists, says the sabha insider, were unable to attract huge crowds.

The hospitality sector, too, rues that there has been a fall in listeners. About 400 m from the Music Academy is the 87-yearold New Woodlands Hotel. It used to be sold out for the entire season, but not this year. “We were fully booked for only 15 days. We had a lot of cancellations and vacancies for the rest of the period,” says Venkataramana Babu , general manager of the hotel. “We have been seeing a dip in bookings over the years, but this time was the lowest so far. Many of the patrons are very old and cannot travel. There is also added travel anxiety because of the heavy rains and floods in Chennai around this time.”
Babu says the Margazhi festival is an important contributor to the hotel’s revenue in December, one of their busiest months. “After this season, we will have to chalk out some plans to offset the slowdown we are seeing during Margazhi,” he says.
Down the road is the 50-year-old Hotel Maris, flanked by the Music Academy and Narada Gana Sabha. It has been an accommodation of choice for rasikas for decades. The hotel’s general manager, Vijay Venkatesh, says the festival feels different this year: it does not have the “buzz” of previous years. “We generally have 85% occupancy during the
Margazhi season
but this year it is only around 50%,” says Venkatesh. “Only 60% of our regular patrons have showed up this year. Tour operators, who are generally on an overdrive planning large groups for the Margazhi season, have gone silent this year. We barely got any enquiries for bulk bookings.”
The industry watcher says sabhas need to move with the times. Chennai has around 36 sabhas of which the largest are the Tamil Isai Sangam, The Music Academy, Narada Gana Sabha, Parthasarathy Sabha, Sri Krishna Gana Sabha and Vani Mahal. The insider says that, barring the big names, sabhas are having a tough time pulling in the crowds. He blames it partly on the lack of infrastructure such as good acoustics, comfortable seating and even clean toilets. “On a good day when star musicians are performing across sabhas, there will be 3,000-4,000 listeners,” says the sabha insider. “That is still a very minuscule number compared with what popular music attracts. It is a very niche audience and one that has gotten used to listening to Carnatic music for free. The smaller sabhas do not make any money. It is the duty of the rasika to buy tickets because unless that happens, the sabhas will see no money.”
The larger sabhas, the insider adds, are better off as they let out their concert halls throughout the year for various performances and functions, which keep the cash register ringing.
A FULL HOUSE
Narada Gana Sabha does not have any complaints. Says secretary K Harishankar: “This year we saw a larger crowd than we did in 2022 and 2023. We sold more season tickets and daily tickets and got more revenue than in the last two years. It looks like the festival has stabilised after the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021.” He says there are about 10 established sabhas that conduct concerts during the music season.
“These sabhas have concerts and functions through the year whereas the smaller venues generally come together only during the Margazhi season. For them, the crowds depend on the performer. For us, we had houseful shows for five or six artists, including Ranjani-Gayatri, Sandeep Narayan and Vishakha Hari.”
Hari, a Carnatic music vocalist and proponent of Harikatha, says she had 12 performances, which ran to packed houses across sabhas. “A lot of the sabhas bank on seasoned performers to draw the crowds. Some of my shows were ticketed at Rs 2,500 which is not something I’m very comfortable with because it makes my art form out of reach of a large audience,” she says. “But sabhas, too, have to run and often shows of established artists are sold at a premium so that concerts of young, up=and-coming artists can have lower ticket rates. I would say it is reasonable to charge up to Rs 1,000 but not more.”

Singer Sandeep Narayan says there was a 40% uptick in ticket sales for his concerts this year over last year. “I performed 12 shows of which three were sold out. Only two had a smaller turnout. At every show a handful of people would come up to me and say that they discovered my music on social media. For some, it was their first ever Carnatic music experience,” he says.
AFTER THE CARNATIC WARS
This year’s music festival was preceded by months-long acrimony. In March, when the Music Academy decided to honour Krishna with the Kalanidhi Award, the Carnatic music world cleaved into two. Since 2015, Krishna had boycotted the Margazhi season, criticising the Carnatic music community for discriminatory practices and elitism. The vocalists Ranjani and Gayatri said they were withdrawing from their December 25 concert at the Academy as the season would be presided over by Krishna who, they alleged, had caused “immense damage” to the Carnatic music world, and “wilfully and happily stomped” over the sentiments of the community.
This season, Ranjani-Gayatri sang to packed halls across the city but did not sing for the Music Academy. Krishna, however, took the Music Academy stage on December 25 and performed to a full house.
Some singers say a drop in footfall could be true of certain sabhas but it cannot be said of the festival as a whole.
Says vocalist Palghat Ramprasad: “I had about 12 shows this season and I did not see any drop in rasikas. In fact, I would say there was a marginal increase. The fall in patronage at certain halls might be seen as a mark of silent protest by certain rasikas. But to say that this was the case across the board would be inaccurate.”
ET Bureau
Ramprasad says the number of youngsters attending concerts has gone up. “Social media has helped us reach this demographic that is curious to know more about classical music,” he says. “Many of my students travelled for the Margazhi festival and I would argue that the landmark hotels that once housed rasikas saw a drop in occupancy probably because all these youngsters are staying in Airbnbs and serviced apartments.”

FOOD OF LOVE
Whether the rasikas went to the sabhas or not, they did flock to the sabha canteens. “During the entire December music season, if we keep the average price of a ticket at Rs 250, concerts bring in just over Rs 1.3 crore to Chennai sabhas,” said V Sriram, music historian and secretary of the Music Academy, at a recent talk on the economics of the
Margazhi season
. “Meanwhile, food at sabha canteens brings in Rs 6 crore. Concert ticket sales are nowhere near canteen sales. People from various parts of the city think there is a food festival going on and dine at the canteens.”
Music may be the food of love but it still comes second to the love for food.

Innovation Takes Centrestage In Abu Dhabi,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/innovation-takes-centrestage-in-abu-dhabi/articleshow/117072183.cms,09-01-2025,"Meet the Drapers scouts for groundbreaking ideas in the new season looking for cutting-edge solutions to global challenges
KHATIJA ALI  Founder & CEO, Biosapien
"" This is a victory not just for us but for the millions of patients who will one day benefit from this technology. ""
IT bubbling as the hub of business ideas in the region. Big bulge funds are lining up to be part of the action. Abu Dhabi’s strategic investments in technology, healthcare, and sustainability have positioned it as the ideal host for Meet the Drapers, a reality show scouting promising startups. Startups pitched their ideas to a panel of distinguished judges, trying to identify transformational ideas that could impact the world. Since Abu Dhabi has ranked as the fastest-growing emerging ecosystem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, it was only logical for the Meet the Drapers team to scout for opportunities there. The region is also being seen as the sixth fastest grown startup ecosystem in the world, according to Startup Genome and the Global Entrepreneurship Network. Key2enable is on a mission to make technology accessible for children with disabilities. Founded by Karla and Marcelo, the startup has developed the KeyX platform—a combination of hardware and software designed to empower children to communicate, learn, and thrive, regardless of their physical or verbal limitations. Its tailored solutions for children with motor disabilities, the platform opens up a world of opportunities for education, social interaction, and creative expression. Biosapien is redefining cancer treatment through its pioneering MediChip technology. This 3D-printed, bioresorbable chip delivers localised chemotherapy directly to tumours, drastically reducing side effects like nausea and fatigue common with systemic treatment. MediChip personalised care focuses on targeted delivery, enabling patients to undergo therapy without disrupting their daily lives. Its innovation has already garnered widespread attention, with oncologists praising its potential to revolutionise how cancer is treated worldwide. South Africa’s energy crisis has found an innovative solution in Momint, a blockchain-based platform enabling private investment in solar energy. Momint aims to address the challenges of using fossil fuel while driving the transition to renewable power. It allows individuals to invest in solar installations for schools, factories, and farms, the platform bridges the gap between funding and sustainability. Investors fund solar panels, and in return, they earn a steady income from the energy generated. After the jury evaluated presentations from dozens of companies, Biosapien emerged as their choice from Abu Dhabi. As the top prize winner, it is now eager to scale its operations and bring its life-changing innovation to patients globally. “This is a victory not just for us but for the millions of patients who will one day benefit from this technology,” said Dr. Khatija. The next step for Biosapien could be to scale up its operations and to take its life-changing innovation to patients globally.

"Upbeat on Bollywood, RSVP plans to raise production budget",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/upbeat-on-bollywood-rsvp-plans-to-raise-production-budget/articleshow/117063797.cms,09-01-2025,"Ronnie Screwvala
's
RSVP Movies
plans to make a contrarian move by enhancing its Rs 200-250 crore annual production budget to grow its content pipeline at a time when Bollywood is battling a downturn in box office performance, worsening the risk-return ratio.
""RSVP outlay I would say normally on an annualised basis is between Rs 200 to 250 crore is what we normally have as our working capital investment cycle. I am willing to grow that sum,"" Screwvala, the producer behind hit films like Chennai Express, Uri: The Surgical Strike and Barfi!, told ET.
At a time when most
film production companies
are looking to raise capital, Screwvala said
RSVP
will utilise its cash reserves for funding its projects and does not plan to scout for external funding.
RSVP, which has produced about 40 films and web series, owning the IP (intellectual property) for most of the releases, is aiming to produce three to four films a year.
Calling RSVP Movies a passion project, Screwvala said the film production company produces all types of films with budgets ranging from Rs 1 crore to Rs 100 crore. The company has also produced web series like Mismatched and Lust Stories.

Screwvala termed the future of the content production industry as “phenomenal” but noted that producers need to increase their risk taking ability. In recent years, a mix of lack of creative storytelling and funding challenges have put a pause on new film projects.
""It's just that we have to open up our minds and we need to be risk taking. The day we stop taking risks, it's a problem. Which is what is happening right now,"" Screwvala said, adding that past failures should not act as a deterrent for filmmakers to produce great content for audiences.
PVR Inox MD Ajay Bijli had also earlier called upon filmmakers to make high quality content for the big screen to encourage audiences to continue returning to the theatres. India is one of the biggest film producing markets with 1,500-2,000 films getting released each year across languages.
Screwvala is also bullish about the
sports business in India
with U Sports—part of Screwvala's Unilazer Ventures owning sports franchises in
Pro Kabaddi League
(PKL), Ultimate Table Tennis (UTT), and Global Chess League (GCL). While his PKL team is successful and profitable, the other two franchises are still in the investment phase.
Screwvala bemoaned the fact that PKL is not able to realise its full potential and create more value for stakeholders due to its ownership by a broadcaster, Jio Star—earlier Star India—which owns 74% stake in Mashal Sports, the owner of PKL.
While praising
Jio Star
for building the league, he said broadcasters should ideally not own a sports league because it leads to a conflict of interest which deters rival broadcasters from participating in media rights bidding.
In 2021, Star had acquired the PKL media rights for Rs 900 crore till 2025 after a bidding process which didn't attract any bidder other than Star. Sony Pictures Networks India, which had shown interest in PKL, didn't bid for the rights due to Star's ownership of the league.
""I think PKL could have actually become a big value spinner. The only problem is that a broadcaster owns a sports league. I'm the only one who cries foul on that. But no broadcaster should be owning a sports league to that level,"" he noted. He also said that the value of PKL media rights would have been 1.5 times more than it was last time had there been a competitive bidding process.
Capri Sports' acquisition of PKL's Kolkata franchise from the Future Group at an estimated Rs 150 crore has set the benchmark value for all PKL franchises, said Screwvala.

"'The Brutalist,' 'Emilia Perez' triumph at Golden Globes",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/the-brutalist-emilia-perez-triumph-at-golden-globes/articleshow/117003253.cms,07-01-2025,"BEVERLY HILLS, California: ""
The Brutalist
,"" the story of a Holocaust survivor who chases the American dream, and musical thriller ""
Emilia Perez
"" took home the first major movie honors of Hollywood's awards season at the
Golden Globes
on Sunday.
Voters for the Globes, handed out by entertainment journalists around the world, named ""The Brutalist"" best movie drama and star Adrien Brody the best drama film actor. The film also landed the best director prize for Brady Corbet.
Brody, who plays an architect trying to build a life in the United States, called the movie from independent studio A24 ""a monument to humanity and the arts.""
""To the many people who have struggled emigrating to this country, I hope this work stands to lift you up a bit and give you a voice,"" Brody said on stage at the black-tie event in Beverly Hills.
""Emilia Perez,"" about a Mexican drug lord who transitions to a woman, claimed best movie musical or comedy. The Spanish-language Netflix movie led all films with four awards in total, including a supporting actress honor for Zoe Saldana.
Live Events
""The light always wins over the darkness,"" said Karla Sofia Gascon, the trans actor who plays the lead role in ""Emilia Perez."" ""You can never take away our soul, or existence or identity.""
The Globes kick off a marathon awards season in Hollywood that culminates with the Academy Awards in March. Winning a Globe can shine a spotlight on movies angling for the coveted best picture prize at the Oscars.
""Wicked,"" the box office smash based on the popular Broadway musical, claimed the Globe for cinematic and box office achievement. Director Jon M. Chu spoke of his love for movies as he was surrounded by the cast on stage.
""When pessimism and cynicism sort of rule the planet right now, we can still make art, and still make art that is an act of optimism, that is empowerment and that is joy,"" Chu said.
DEMI MOORE HONORED
In a surprise, Demi Moore won best actress in a musical or comedy film for her leading role in ""The Substance,"" the story of a fading actress seeking a fountain of youth.
Known for movies such as ""St. Elmo's Fire"" and ""Ghost,"" Moore told the crowd that she had once been dismissed as a ""popcorn actress"" and feared her career was over.
""I'm just in shock right now,"" Moore said as she held her trophy on stage. ""I've been doing this a long time, over 45 years. This is the first time I've ever won anything as an actor.""
Among other awards, Brazil's Fernanda Torres took the trophy for best actress in a movie drama for Portuguese language film ""I'm Still Here."" The movie tells the story of a woman who must reinvent herself after her family is shattered by violence during the military dictatorship in Brazil in 1971.
Sebastian Stan was named best actor in a film musical or comedy for ""A Different Man,"" a movie about a man with facial disfigurement.
""Our ignorance and discomfort around disability and disfigurement has to end now,"" Stan said. ""We have to normalize it and continue to expose ourselves to it and our children.""
Kieran Culkin was named best supporting film actor for ""A Real Pain,"" a dramedy about cousins who travel to Poland to explore their family's roots.
At the start of the show, first-time host Nikki Glaser welcomed the celebrity crowd to ""Ozempic's biggest night"" and teased Timothee Chalamet, Harrison Ford, Selena Gomez and other power players in the audience.
""You could do anything, except tell the country who to vote for,"" Glaser said, referring to widespread Hollywood support for the losing candidate in the recent U.S. presidential election.
On the red carpet ahead of the show, celebrities dazzled in black, gold and silver gowns with an occasional red or periwinkle in the mix. ""Wicked"" star Ariana Grande wore a yellow Givenchy gown with a beaded bodice that she said was a tribute to the yellow brick road leading to Oz in the movie musical.
Globe honorees were chosen by 334 entertainment journalists from 85 countries, compared with roughly 9,000 voters who select the Academy Awards. The Globes voting body has been expanded in recent years and organizers instituted reforms after being criticized for ethical lapses and a lack of diversity.
In TV categories, ""Hacks"" won best musical or comedy series, ""Baby Reindeer"" was named best limited series and ""Shogun"" earned best TV drama

Hollywood set for a blockbuster 2025 in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/hollywood-set-for-a-blockbuster-in-india/articleshow/116972151.cms,06-01-2025,"Hollywood is on the verge of a successful year in India, with its share of total box office collections expected to more than double in 2025, reaching 22% from less than 10% last year, said producers and industry analysts.
This dramatic rise is fuelled by three key trends—a growing appetite for larger-than-life spectacles, rising acceptance of Hollywood films dubbed in regional languages, and a high recall value of intellectual properties (IPs) that had already captivated audiences.
In the past decade, the contribution of Hollywood films to the total box office collection ranged between 18% and 20%.
Devang Sampat, managing director at Cinepolis India, said, “We expect the contribution of Hollywood films to exceed 20% after a not-so-satisfactory last year. The 2025 lineup features films that resonate strongly with the Indian audience.”
Movies such as Avatar: Fire and Ash, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, The Conjuring: Last Rites, Captain America: Brave New World, Karate Kid: Legends, Jurassic World Rebirth, Superman, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, and Now You See Me 3 boast a strong fan following in India.

Girish Wankhede, a movie trade analyst, said, “I think the contribution of Hollywood films to India’s total box office collection is likely to double compared to last year.” He added that 2024 experienced the ripple effects of strikes by writers and actors in Hollywood, which impacted the production and performance of tentpole films—high-budget, studio-backed money-spinners.
According to US-based consulting firm Camoin Associates, the strikes—centred around demands for fair compensation, better working conditions, and concerns about the use of AI—by writers and actors from May to September 2023 likely caused an economic loss of over $5 billion across the US. The disruption also affected the worldwide performance of Hollywood films.
Data from American movie database website Box Office Mojo reveals that the cumulative worldwide collection of 200 Hollywood films released in 2024 was $24.80 billion—a 26% decline.
Hollywood films set for release in India in 2025 are major tentpole productions designed to be experienced in theatres, not on mobile devices. This key factor has fuelled optimism for higher box office collections of
Hollywood films in India
.
Ameya Naik, producer and founder of Fantasy Films, an event management company said, “In India, over the past ten years, Hollywood films with strong recall value and recognisable IPs have performed exceptionally well, delivering box office collections of Rs 80-150 crore each in India alone.” He added that the success of such films is driven by their IPs, rather than the star power of actors.
In 2024, high-recall IP films such as Deadpool & Wolverine and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire demonstrated this trend, generating Rs 169.2 crore and Rs 134.4 crore, respectively, according to box office research firm Sacnilk.
Increasing acceptance of dubbed versions of tentpole films has also contributed significantly to Hollywood's growing success in India.
Jaidev Hemmady, a Hindi film scriptwriter, noted, “Studios in Hollywood have realised the importance of dubbing their films into regional languages in India. These dubbed versions have not only emerged as a valuable revenue stream for studios but have also expanded the audience base for tentpole Hollywood films in India.”
The trend is evident in the case of Mufasa: The Lion King, which collected over Rs 131.4 crore in India, according to Sacnilk. Notably, the Hindi dubbed version contributed Rs 44.1 crore to the total, surpassing the English original’s Rs 41.9 crore collection.

Jio Star files broadcast tariff at higher rates,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jio-star-files-broadcast-tariff-at-higher-rates/articleshow/116959387.cms,05-01-2025,"Jio Star
, the newly formed entity resulting from the merger of
Star India
and
Viacom18
, has filed its
broadcast tariff
, positioning itself as the
premium broadcaster
in the industry.
The broadcaster has created 83 packs comprising 134 channels, including 85 standard definition (SD), 44 high definition (HD), and 5 free-to-air (FTA) channels.
Apart from Star India and Viacom18 channels, the bouquets also include 19 news channels from Network18 and infotainment channels from AETN18, a joint venture between Network18 and A+E Networks.
As per the reference interconnect offer (RIO), the Star Value Pack (SVP) Hindi and SVP Hindi Basic packs for standard definition (SD) channels have been priced at Rs 110 each—representing an 18% increase over the combined individual Hindi base packs of Star India and Viacom18, which were priced at Rs 59 and Rs 34, respectively.
The broadcaster is offering almost 30 channels in the bouquet across general entertainment, movie, infotainment, kids and sports genres. It has also created bouquet options for regional languages such as Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Odia, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam.
Live Events
Rivals Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) and
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEEL) have also raised the prices of their base bouquets by over 10% in their RIOs.
The final rate hike will depend on the negotiations between the broadcasters and distributors, industry insiders said.
“Now that all the major broadcasters have filed their RIOs, we will sit with them and negotiate to ensure that the burden on the consumer is less,” a TV distribution executive said.
The MRP of Jio Star’s entertainment and
sports channels
has been set at the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(TRAI) regulatory cap of Rs 19.
The Star FTA Pack includes Star Utsav Movies, Colors Cineplex Bollywood, Colors Cineplex Superhits, News18 India, and Sports18 Khel. Earlier, four of the five channels excluding Sports18 Khel were pay channels.
Jio Star is India’s largest broadcaster with channels like Star Plus, Colors, Star Gold and Star Sports. It owns cricket rights to major events including the Indian Premier League (IPL) and those held by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), allowing it to command premium pricing among all broadcasters.
SPNI’s Happy India Smart Hindi pack now costs Rs 54, up from Rs 48 earlier. However, the bouquet now also includes a Hindi movie channel, Sony Max 1. The Zee Family Pack Hindi SD, which is now called Zee All in One Pack Hindi SD, now costs Rs 53, compared to Rs 47 previously, and includes English entertainment channel Zee Café.
The combined subscription revenue of top broadcasters, including Jio Star, Sony, Zee and
Sun TV
was ₹17,842 crore in FY24, up 4.2% year on year.

Bollywood dips in the air as streaming goes seamless,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bollywood-dips-in-the-air-as-streaming-goes-seamless/articleshow/116900101.cms,04-01-2025,"Mumbai: The once-lucrative market for satellite TV rights of
Hindi
films has seen a dramatic decline, with values plunging over 50% post pandemic due to streaming platforms replacing television channels as the second release window for films and mounting monetisation challenges.
Films that once sold satellite TV rights for Rs 20 crore are now fetching closer to Rs 10 crore amid the shift towards digital platforms, industry insiders said.
Also, with changing audience preferences, the market has become so selective that only box-office successes and star-studded films are attracting buyers, leaving most Hindi films unsold on both streaming and TV, experts said.
Although satellite rights began declining with the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar, the drop accelerated during the pandemic when filmmakers released films directly on streaming platforms to cut losses due to cinema closures.
“Producers, recognising the immense financial opportunities and investments made by streaming giants, have increasingly turned their attention to these platforms as their primary avenue for selling film rights,” said Shariq Patel, former CEO of
Zee Studios
.
Live Events
The shift of advertising revenue from TV to digital has also prompted broadcasters to reassess the return on investment (ROI) for acquiring movies.
According to industry estimates, broadcasters that previously allocated Rs 400–800 crore for satellite rights now face significant cuts, with many reducing their budgets substantially.
Veteran media executive Neeraj Vyas, formerly with
Sony Pictures Networks
India, observed that with major films appearing on OTT platforms within weeks of theatrical releases, audiences increasingly prefer streaming over traditional TV, impacting viewership and ratings.
The gap between theatrical and OTT releases is typically 8–10 weeks.
Vyas said films on TV previously attracted strong ratings over multiple airings, but now, even after just two or three broadcasts, viewership declines sharply.
The reallocation of ad budgets from TV to digital platforms has further impacted TV monetisation for the film genre. “TV broadcasting is feeling the financial impact of this shift, as digital platforms and e-commerce continue to capture a growing share of ad revenues that once predominantly supported TV,” Vyas said.
Selective Deals
Hindi film producers are also finding it harder to secure on-demand streaming deals amid increasing selection and competition from across the country and the world.
As streaming services have matured, they have become more selective in their acquisitions, focusing on financially sustainable content aligned with their brand, Patel said.
“This selective approach has further intensified competition among producers, who now face the dual challenge of navigating lower satellite revenues and stricter streaming deals,” he said.
While satellite rights now account for only 20% of a film’s value, streaming contributes the remaining 80%.
To remain competitive, broadcasters are now looking to acquire both TV and digital rights of films to support their movie channels and streaming platforms.
Streaming platforms seek only digital rights.
Channels Stay Upbeat
Despite these challenges, Hindi movie channels still capture 25% of TV viewership, with 70% of movie consumption on TV coming from iconic catalogue titles, according to Ruchir
Tiwari
, chief cluster officer – Hindi movie channels at
Zee Entertainment
.
Growth in the free-to-air (FTA) space has expanded viewership, especially for older films, which continue to perform well on television despite also being available on YouTube, he noted.
While OTT offers a niche, premium experience, TV remains an accessible and affordable platform, ensuring sustained viewership for Hindi films and potential growth in revenues with realigned cost structures, Tiwari said.
Industry stakeholders, including filmmakers and platforms, are adjusting cost structures to foster a healthier ecosystem for Hindi cinema, he said.
“This dynamism makes me very optimistic about the growth of the Hindi film industry, which will provide an impetus for movie channels to increase their revenues with sustainable, realigned cost structures to reach healthy financial stability,” Tiwari said.
While agreeing with him that the movie genre remains a fundamentally strong content proposition, Vyas said the answer to the immediate situation could well be joint or co-licensing of certain large marquee titles, where broadcasters could enter into an agreement to mutually split the cost and divide the screenings of a title throughout the year.
“This approach would ensure that films continue to attract satellite buyers, and broadcasters can alleviate the pressure while monetising the product effectively,” Vyas said.
Experts said TV has seen a shift in audience profile, now catering more to the 30-plus age group, as younger audiences increasingly move towards other platforms. This shift is accompanied by growing viewership in second- and third-tier towns, highlighting the continued reach and buoyancy of television across these areas.
“In terms of content, it’s not streaming that directly impacts viewership but rather the type of movies that resonate with these audiences. Evergreen films continue to perform well on television, indicating a strong connection with viewers,” said LV Krishnan, chief executive of
TAM Media
, leaders in television audience measurement in India.
“From a return on investment (ROI) perspective, rerunning classic or older films offers better value compared to acquiring new releases, as these reruns reach the right demographic at a lower cost, delivering stronger ROI for broadcasters,” Krishnan said.
He added that the broader ecosystem reflects this trend, with even cinemas re-releasing blockbuster films from past years to attract audiences back to theatres, similar to how television capitalises on classics to draw viewership.
A case in point is
PVR Inox
, which launched the Kareena Kapoor Film Festival, celebrating the 25-year illustrious journey of
Bollywood
star Kareena Kapoor Khan. The re-release of popular films like Tumbbad, Laila Majnu, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein, and Veer Zaara has also contributed approximately 6% of Q2 admissions.

"Sebi to continue probe against ZEEL and its promoters, Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/sebi-to-continue-probe-against-zeel-and-its-promoters-subhash-chandra-and-punit-goenka/articleshow/116894207.cms,03-01-2025,"MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (
Sebi
) has withdrawn a
show cause notice
(SCN) issued to
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL) and promoters,
Subhash Chandra
and
Punit Goenka
. Allegations contained in the notice would now form part of findings of the market regulator's ongoing probe against the two executives.
As per Sebi's new order, details of the SCN dated July 6, 2022, issued by the adjudicating officer to ZEEL promoters will be included in the SCN to be issued for the current matter.
The regulator has also rejected settlement applications dated September 2, 2022, filed by ZEEL and Punit Goenka. These applications were related to the SCN, which pertained to alleged siphoning of funds from ZEEL to other promoter entities.
The settlement applications submitted by the media and entertainment company and Goenka were rejected by Sebi during adjudication proceedings on April 18, 2023.
The regulator decided to proceed against ZEEL and the father-son duo under Section 11B of the Sebi Act, 1992, which empowers it to issue notices and levy penalties.
Live Events
According to Sebi’s order, the content of the SCN, including the examination report and all relied-upon documents, will form an integral part of its further investigation report in the ZEEL matter.
Sebi had initiated adjudication proceedings against ZEEL for alleged violations of listing obligations and disclosure requirements, as well as against Chandra and Goenka for alleged failures in corporate governance norms.
Initially, Sebi appointed Parag Basu as the adjudicating officer (AO) for the matter. Following a reassignment due to the transfer of appointed AOs, Amit Kapoor was appointed as the AO on De cember 27, 2024.
“The panel of whole time members of Sebi rejected the settlement applications and referred the matter for further investigation. Subsequent to the investigation, it was decided by the Competent Authority to proceed against the Noticees under Section 11B of the Sebi Act, 1992,” the regulator said in a three-page order.
“The allegations in the SCN dated July 06, 2022 issued by AO are to be subsumed with the findings of the further investigation carried out by Sebi in the instant matter. Accordingly, the content of the SCN dated July 06, 2022 issued by the AO including the examination report and all the relied upon documents will be treated as integral part of the further investigation report by Sebi in the matter of ZEEL,” it said.
The case pertains to a letter of comfort (LoC) issued by ZEEL promoters to
Yes Bank
for a ₹200 crore loan, which was extended to Essel Green Mobility. Yes Bank appropriated ZEEL’s ₹200 crore fixed deposit after seven Essel Group companies failed to repay the loans.
While Essel Group entities claimed to have reimbursed ₹ 200 crore to ZEEL, Sebi alleged that these funds were not reimbursed from their own sources but were instead routed through ZEEL, its subsidiaries, and other listed Essel Group companies.

Dubbing rights bring in big bucks for South films,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/dubbing-rights-bring-in-big-bucks-for-south-films/articleshow/116862687.cms,01-01-2025,"Mumbai:
South Indian films
generated as much as a quarter of their revenue by selling streaming and
satellite rights
of their dubbed versions in 2024, compared with less than 10% seven years ago, according to distributors and industry analysts.
Streaming giant Netflix paid ₹175 crore for the Hindi dubbed version of the recently released multilingual blockbuster
Kalki 2898 AD
, trade analysts said. The film's dubbed rights in southern languages were sold to Amazon Prime for ₹200 crore, they said. India's largest blockbuster film, Pushpa 2: The Rule, recently sold the
streaming rights
of all languages for ₹275 crore, according to box office research firm Sacnilk.
""Among the various languages a pan-India southern hit is dubbed, it is the Hindi dubbed version which fetches the highest revenue to a producer given its reach,"" said Ramesh Bala, an entertainment sector analyst based in Chennai. A southern film can sell streaming and satellite rights separately for each dubbed language. For instance, the satellite and digital rights of a film originally made in Telugu and dubbed in Hindi, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam can be sold separately to television channels and streaming platforms.
G Dhananjeyan, cofounder of Tamil Nadu-based production house Creative Entertainers & Distributors, said the 2017 movie,
Baahubali
: The Conclusion, opened the eyes of southern producers to an additional source of revenue: theatre release of a dubbed version in Hindi.
Live Events
Over the past seven years, southern films such as KGF: Chapter 2 (2022), Kantara (2022), RRR (2022) and Kalki 2898 AD (2024), which have succeeded on a pan-India level, have consciously followed this strategy. The dubbed Hindi version of Baahubali: The Conclusion recorded lifetime box-office collections of ₹510.90 crore. The satellite rights of the Hindi dubbed version were sold to Sony TV Network for ₹51 crore, while its digital rights were sold to Netflix for ₹25.5 crore.
A large part of the success of these southern films can be traced back to the early acceptance of dubbed southern films on television. Ameya Naik, a producer and founder of event management company Fantasy Films, said: ""Pan-India channels such as Zee TV laid the foundation for a pan-India southern hit. The channel bought dubbed southern films as there was a potential audience for them. Then, the emergence of YouTube channels such as Goldmines Telefilms fuelled the interest of North Indian audiences in dubbed southern films.""
This increasing acceptance in the North also led to a new trend: southern films featuring Bollywood stars. Examples include
Ajay Devgn
(RRR), Sanjay Dutt and Raveena Tandon (KGF: Chapter 2) and
Amitabh Bachchan
(Kalki 2898 AD).

India is in concert with music again,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/india-is-in-concert-with-music-again/articleshow/116843476.cms,01-01-2025,"Mumbai: Concerts are staging a triumphant comeback in India after pandemic-induced challenges brought the industry to a standstill. Artists like Diljit Dosanjh and Karan Aujla are drawing large crowds, while Dua Lipa, Maroon 5, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay are fuelling a growing appetite for international acts. The scramble for tickets to Coldplay's upcoming India tour highlights the growing appetite for such events.
This resurgence for live music events is driven by Gen Z and a burgeoning middle class eager for premium experiences. Once overshadowed by cricket, musical events are gaining momentum in the live entertainment landscape.
However, challenges persist, particularly due to the lack of state-of-the-art infrastructure at large-scale venues, although social media's influence continues to transform the industry.
Platforms like Instagram and YouTube are enabling artists to build a big following and connect with fans.
Corporates are also tapping into the industry's potential.
Zomato
acquired Paytm Insider for ₹2,048 crore to expand its footprint in live entertainment.
Swiggy
is similarly exploring opportunities, intensifying competition with ticketing giants like BookMyShow.
Live Events
""Music concerts post-Covid have been a rage, and this trend started especially after the Eras tour by Taylor Swift, which is believed to have grossed $2 billion in revenues,"" said NV Capital managing partner Nitin Menon. ""The trend is picking up in India and can be seen in Diljit Dosanjh's tour... with all his shows being houseful. Coldplay in January is another example, which has become a rage, with some tickets in the grey market being sold for lakhs.""
The fact that Zomato bought out Paytm Insider shows the potential and even Swiggy is eager to get a slice of the pie, he said.
""This trend of music festivals and concerts is a huge movement, and we would see a similar trend picking up in India,"" Menon said.

Viacom18 becomes subsidiary of Reliance Industries,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/viacom18-becomes-subsidiary-of-reliance-industries/articleshow/116834176.cms,31-12-2024,"Viacom18 Media Private Limited
(“Viacom18”) has officially become a
subsidiary
of
Reliance Industries
Limited (“Reliance”) effective December 30, 2024. This development follows the conversion of 24,61,33,682 compulsorily convertible preference shares (“CCPS”) into an equivalent number of equity shares, solidifying Reliance’s majority ownership in the company.
As stated in the disclosure dated November 14, 2024, Reliance held a 70.49% stake in Viacom18 on a fully diluted basis, comprising 5,57,27,821 equity shares and 24,61,33,682 CCPS. Viacom18 was previously a
material subsidiary
of Network18 Media & Investments Limited (“Network18”). However, with shareholder approval under Regulation 24(5) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, Viacom18 ceased to be a subsidiary of Network18.
Following the CCPS conversion, Reliance now holds 83.88% of Viacom18’s total equity share capital while maintaining its 70.49% stake on a fully diluted basis. This marks a key restructuring milestone, as Viacom18 transitions under the direct ownership of Reliance, effectively ending its subsidiary status under Network18.
The allotment of equity shares was confirmed by Viacom18 on December 30, 2024, at 7:46 p.m. This move positions Reliance as a key driver in Viacom18’s future growth and strategic direction.

"#25 For 2025: Can we have unique content for everyone, everywhere, all at once?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/can-we-have-unique-content-for-everyone-everywhere-all-at-once/articleshow/116807698.cms,31-12-2024,"The
future of entertainment
lies in the hands of audiences, who will decide how and where they want to consume content. Imagine a scenario where a QR code allows viewers to choose whether to watch a film in a theatre, on the phone, or on TV. This flexibility will define new-age entertainment.
However, content must reach a wider audience, especially in a country with India's massive population. For example, while Stree 2 was a blockbuster, it was watched by only 45 million people. This highlights the huge scope for broader content distribution.
In the coming years, technology-particularly AI and innovative distribution models-will empower filmmakers and create platforms for new content. The key, however, is to craft stories that resonate with a large, diverse audience. We need to focus on creating content that is about India, for India, and of India.
I don't believe there's a ""takeover"" by southern cinema. Since the pandemic, the Hindi film industry has seen remarkable successes, with films such as Animal, Gadar 2, Pathaan, Jawan, and Stree 2 achieving box office collections of ₹500-600 crore in India. This clearly shows that the Hindi film industry is performing as well as its southern counterpart. What truly matters is giving audiences something fresh and unique-exactly what these films have delivered. Instead of viewing southern and Hindi films as separate entities, we should embrace them as part of one
Indian film industry
. My hope is that films from across the country resonate with audiences nationwide.
Both southern and Hindi industries produce hits, but there are also films from both that fail to connect with audiences. As someone who stays in touch with creators from both industries, I am optimistic that next two years will bring unique stories from across India.Streaming platforms are not a threat to cinema-they will coexist with theatres. While streaming services are still expanding their reach, they complement rather than compete with the theatrical experience.

Poonam Pandey
, Kangana Ranaut to Allu Arjun, actors and celebrities across industries made headlines for the wrong reasons this year. Some made deliberate attempts to grab attention, while others became a talk of the town at what could have been a highlight of their career. Here is a list of 10 most talked about controversies in 2024 in showbiz:
1. Allu Arjun and the Sandhya Theatre stampede case:
Telugu film star Allu Arjun was arrested in connection with the death of a 35-year-old woman during a promotional event of ""Pushpa 2: The Rule"" at Hyderabad's Sandhya Theatre earlier this month.
While the woman died, her eight-year-old son was seriously injured as fans thronged the theatre to catch a glimpse of the actor, who is currently out on interim bail. The movie, however, has emerged as the biggest hit of the year by earning over Rs 1,700 crore at the box office.
2. Poonam Pandey death hoax:
In February, Poonam Pandey's team dropped the bombshell news of her 'death' from cervical cancer, which turned out to be fake news, more like a stunt pulled off by the actor-model in what she later said was a tool to spread awareness about the disease.
Social media users, some celebrities and others unanimously called out Pandey for using a serious issue for a publicity stunt. Her PR agency issued an apology amid widespread criticism.

3.
Hema Committee Report
:
In August, Malayalam cinema was rocked by the revelations of the expansive Justice Hema Committee report, which detailed instances of widespread and persistent harassment and exploitation of women in the industry.
All 17 members of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) executive committee, including its president and senior actor Mohanlal, submitted their resignation amid the growing allegations raised by women against its members.
Multiple FIRs were registered against many high-profile personalities, including actors Siddique, Jayasurya, former chairperson of Kerala State Chalachitra Academy Ranjith, and CPI (M) MLA and actor M Mukesh, in the wake of the revelations made in the report.
4. ""Laapataa Ladies"" as India's official Oscars entry:
The Film Federation of India was criticised in September by a section of social media users after it selected ""Laapataa Ladies"" over ""All We Imagine As Light"" to represent the country at Oscars 2025.
Though both films were critically acclaimed, many believe that ""All We Imagine..."", the first Indian film to win the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival, had a better shot at clinching the elusive best international film Oscar.
The all-male FFI jury also received brickbats for their citation about ""Laapataa Ladies"", which is out of the Oscars race.
5. Delay in release of ""Emergency"":
This Kangana Ranaut film was delayed multiple times as it didn't receive a clearance from the CBFC for theatrical release. It was mired in controversy after many Sikh organisations accused the makers of misrepresenting the community and getting facts wrong. The movie is now scheduled to be released on January 17.
Its lead star and director Ranaut made headlines after she was hit in the face by a constable during a security check at the Chandigarh airport, days after she was elected to the Lok Sabha from Mandi in Himachal Pradesh on a BJP ticket. The actor was also pulled up by the party after she made disparaging remarks on the farmers agitation against the now repealed three farm laws.
6. Allegations of black marketing of tickets to
Coldplay
, Diljit Dosanjh shows:
The Enforcement Directorate in October said it detected alleged irregularities after it conducted raids in a money laundering case to probe ""black marketing"" of tickets for the music concerts by British rock band Coldplay and Punjabi singing star Diljit Dosanjh.
Dosanjh also made headlines for calling out different state governments for directing him to avoid singing songs related to alcohol, drugs and violence at his concerts as part of his ongoing ""Dil-Luminati India Tour 2024"".
7. ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack"" row:
This Netflix series kicked up a storm in September when a segment on social media claimed that the show by Anubhav Sinha concealed the real religious identities of the terrorists involved in the 1999 incident.
The streamer later included the real and code names of the hijackers depicted in the show after Netflix India's content head, Monika Shergill was summoned by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
8. Nayanthara-Dhanush clash:
In an open letter, Nayanthara last month called out Dhanush, who produced her 2015 Tamil movie ""Naanum Rowdy Dhaan"", for refusing permission to use footage from their film in her Netflix documentary ""Nayanthara: Beyond The Fairy Tale"".
She criticised Dhanush for sending a legal notice demanding Rs 10 crore in damages after the trailer of the film was released online. Nayanthara's letter received support from actors, including Shruti Haasan, Parvathy, Aishwarya Rajesh, and Nazriya Nazim, all of whom have worked with Dhanush.
9. Kapil Sharma's alleged racist comments against Atlee:
Earlier this month, stand-up comic and host Kapil Sharma was in a soup for allegedly poking fun at Atlee's skin colour during the ""Jawan"" director's appearance on Netflix's ""The Great Indian Kapil Show"".
Amid backlash, Sharma defended his comments and requested people to not spread hate on social media.
10. Darshan and Renukaswamy murder case:
Kannada star Darshan Thoogudeepa was arrested in June for allegedly killing Renukaswamy, his fan, for sending obscene messages to the actor's associate Pavithra Gowda. Darshan, Gowda and seven others were recently granted bail by the Karnataka High Court.

"After blockbuster blow, Bollywood staring at mid-budget movie blues",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/after-blockbuster-blow-bollywood-staring-at-mid-budget-movie-blues/articleshow/116774965.cms,30-12-2024,"The Hindi film industry, troubled by a persistent
shortage of big-budget films
in the past two years, is grappling with a more pressing concern: a glaring dearth of mid-budget films set for release in 2025, according to film producers and industry experts.
Mid-budget films are the backbone of the industry's annual output as fewer than ten big-budget films are released in a typical year.
Now, several factors have stacked the odds against mid-budget films, experts said. These include limited opportunities to recover investments through digital rights, skyrocketing promotion and marketing costs, a sharp rise in actor fees, unfavourable economics for multiplex audiences, budget recalibrations, and the growing preference for streaming platforms as a more viable outlet for such films.
""It's a worrisome sign,"" said Girish Johar, producer and film business analyst. ""There have been no major announcements of mid-budget films for 2025.""
Nearly 50% of mid-budget films announced in the past year have been shelved, leading to a reduced pipeline of releases for 2025, he said.
Live Events
Trade analysts pointed out that several prominent mid-budget projects, such as The Intern (remake), Khalnayak 2, Ram Lakhan, Je Le Zara and Chakda Xpress, have either been delayed or shelved altogether.
""Producers are recalibrating budgets for mid-budget films due to inflation and
rising actor fees
,"" said a producer who wanted to remain anonymous. This has significantly slowed down production.
Mid-budget films are typically defined as those made within the range of ₹15-₹50 crore. However, trade analysts note that actor fees for such films have nearly tripled post-pandemic, driven by the success of a few mid-budget hits. This shift has disrupted the traditional business model for these films.
Veteran filmmaker Vipul Amrutlal Shah, known for hits like Aankhen (2002) and Singh Is Kinng (2008), said that there's a huge appetite for mid-budget films, but it's crucial to keep the budget ""right.""
""Investing more in stars than in the film itself is a flawed business model,"" he said. Shah cited the success of Munjya (2024) and Stree 2 (2024) as evidence that audiences today prioritise content over star power. Scripts for mid-budget films are also being reworked to appeal to a broader audience, further delaying production.
""Audiences are unforgiving toward mid-budget films that lack unique or well-told stories,"" said another producer requesting anonymity.
He added that films blending genres like comedy, horror and suspense are more likely to attract theatre-goers-a trend even streaming platforms are prioritising.
It is estimated that over 200 mid-budget films are currently awaiting release either in theatres or on streaming platforms. However, producers face a major hurdle: streamers are either offering prices below production costs or reconsidering their decisions based on box-office performance.

"If tax on popcorn is a worry, try munching them in a movie hall. Thankfully, things may change",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/if-tax-on-popcorn-is-a-worry-try-munching-them-in-a-movie-hall-thankfully-things-may-change/articleshow/116749760.cms,28-12-2024,"Popcorn is believed to be one of the world’s oldest snacks. Evidence —6,700-year-old cobs with puffed kernels-excavated by archaeologists in Peru suggests exactly that. For most of the time since antiquity, the humble popcorn did not cause any ruckus.
Until last week, that is, when it caused significant online chatter, after the Indian gover nment decided to increase the goods and services tax (GST) on caramel popcorn from 5% to 18%.
Nowhere was this conversation louder than among movie-goers.
There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who watch movies in silence, and those who need the crunch of a fistful of popcorn to engage their taste buds as they stare at the silver screen.
Large multiplex chains have since clarified that the change in tax structure is applicable only to packaged popcorn and that it will be business as usual for those freshly popped tubs.
Live Events
But then food and beverages (F&B) has been a nagging concern for movie-goers for a long time, even without the imposition of a new tax. Why exactly is movie food such an expensive experience? And are alternatives popping up?
POPPING MONEY
Both multiplexes and audiences have valid arguments on the pricing of items that are available for a fraction of the money outside the cinemas.
Though single-screen theatres attempted to make money from almost every inch of space, audiences never felt they got a raw deal, as they do in multiplexes now. With good reason, too.
Navendra Singh, AGM at a leading real estate firm, says, “Today, I am paying more than two times the money I incur on ticket prices, on food and beverages. I have to plan my theatre outing carefully. It is no longer a weekend ritual.”
According to various estimates,
movie ticket prices
in multiplexes could be in the range of Rs 260-350, depending on a film’s budget, star cast and the response the film’s trailer has received. A medium-size tub of popcorn could cost anywhere between Rs 300 and Rs 500, higher than the average ticket price in multiplexes, which in the case of
PVR Inox
, the segment leader among multiplexes, was Rs 257 last quarter. Soft drinks may be charged in the range of Rs 200-300, with combopacks starting at Rs 600. This means, for a middle-class family of four, the entire movie-hall experience can be prohibitively expensive.
The result? Along with the increasing supply of mediocre and unentertaining films and the proliferation of streaming platforms, audiences have got one more reason to reduce the frequency of going to the movies. This is reflected in a fall in footfalls.
According to mall developers, multiplexes used to generate 10% of footfalls in malls. This has fallen to 6-7% in recent years. The total admissions (footfalls) in PVR Inox properties fell to 38.8 million in the September 2024 quarter, from 48.4 million in the same period in 2023.
Yogesh Parker, a banking professional with a leading money transfer platform, says, “Today’s audience weighs an outing in multiplexes in terms of a trade-off.” The trade-off he is referring to is whether the cost of an outing in a multiplex can be used to offset the subscription amount of streaming platforms, since most films are available on streaming platforms within two months of theatre release.
EXHIBITION EQUATION
There are close to 8,500 screens in India. Of these, less than 6,500 are operational after the pandemic. There are 3,500 multiplex screens and the remaining are single screens. PVR Inox, which has 1,747 screens, has recorded a higher growth in revenues from F&B than from the sale of tickets in the past four years; the
former has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.3% to Rs 1,958 crore in FY24.
In the same period, revenues from the sale of movie tickets grew at a CAGR of 13.6% to Rs 3,279 crore. This has resulted in the share of F&B in total revenues for PVR Inox increasing to 31.5% in FY24 from 27.8% in FY20.
While the share of movie ticket revenues has grown in the same period—from 50.1% to 52.8%—F&B has been outpacing it. That, along with the higher margins from F&B, goes a long way in explaining why multiplexes price it high.
Producer and film business expert Girish Johar says, “Operating profit margins in the food & beverage segment are much higher.”
Estimates suggest F&B in a cinema costs more than three times outside it. F& B is a stable source of revenue for multiplexes.
Girish Wankhede, a movie trade analyst, says, “Exhibitors share revenues from the sale of movie tickets with distributors. Also, they must pay taxes on the sale of tickets. But food and beverage revenues go entirely to the multiplex.”
Multiplexes cite the high costs of operations (real estate, staff salaries and various overheads) as a reason for high F&B prices.
Rahul Dhyani, founder of Connplex Cinemas, a miniplex (75- seat theatre) chain, says, “Today, a family spends more on dinner at a restaurant than in a multiplex. So, we don’t think F&B costs are very high.”
CHANGE IS IN THE AIR
But not all multiplexes are sticking to the script. Some are trying to disrupt the established pricing regime in a bid to trigger demand, especially at a time when most Hindi films are failing. Recently, multiplex chain Mukta A2 Cinemas capped its F&B prices at Rs 99.
Ask Satwik Lele, COO, Mukta A2 Cinemas why they shifted their strategy and he says, “Our strategy of capping F&B prices under Rs 99 has effectively increased three times our items per head (IPH).” Essentially, Mukta is trying to play the volume game. But can focusing on volume rather than value be a sound strategy?
An analyst, who did not wish to be named, says, “Even if a multiplex caps its F&B cost at Rs 99, it will make an operating profit margin in the range of 50-75% from the food and beverages segment.” Multiplexes must now choose between value strategy—high ticket prices and F&B rates but low footfalls—and volume strategy— affordable ticket and F&B prices but high footfalls.
Ameya Naik, founder of Fantasy Films, an event management company, is in the latter camp, arguing that more people coming into the movies is the need of the hour. He says there is a large audience seeking affordable movie-going experience.
“The audiences who prefer premium services in multiplexes are irregular and smaller in number as they are clear about what they want to watch in theatres,” he says. This strategy can have a broader impact.
If F&B costs are relatively affordable, even an average film may do reasonably good business at the box office.
So which way will your neighbourhood multiplex swing?

Bollywood in 2024: When Hindi cinema failed to deliver at box office and Telugu pan-Indian films ruled,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bollywood-in-2024-when-hindi-cinema-failed-to-deliver-at-box-office-and-telugu-pan-indian-films-ruled/articleshow/116736843.cms,28-12-2024,"With its formulaic stories and action dramas biting the dust at the box office, the dream factory of Bollywood failed to deliver on the expectations of the audiences who turned to Telugu blockbusters like ""Pushpa 2"" and ""Kalki 2898 AD"" for larger-than-life stories. For the Hindi film industry, which banked mostly on nostalgia of re-releases like ""Laila Majnu"", ""Tumbbad"", ""Veer Zaara"" and many others to bring viewers to theatres, the one big success was ""Stree 2"", a horror comedy that made Rs 597 crore nett. Except for ""Stree 2"", no other Hindi film reached near the Rs 500 crore mark at the box office in 2024.
""Pushpa 2"", starring Allu Arjun in the titular role and released on December 5, has earned over Rs 700 crore in Hindi alone at the box office whereas its worldwide gross is more than Rs 1,700 crore, according to figures shared by its producers.
In a novel promotional strategy, Arjun travelled all the way to Patna for the trailer launch of the movie, an indication that the makers were projecting it as a pan-India movie and not a Telugu film. ""Pushpa 1"", released in 2021, had done surprisingly good
business
in the Hindi belt.
Malayalam superstar
Mohanlal
said the success of films like ""Pushpa 2"" are important for the Indian film industry.
""To make an entertainer and bring out a big success is not an easy thing. It requires a lot of patience and many other factors. It is a magic recipe and nobody knows the formula. 'Pushpa' and films like that are turning the wheel of the Indian film industry,"" the actor told PTI.
Live Events
Like ""Pushpa 2"", Nag Ashwin's futuristic retelling of Mahabharata in ""Kalki"", starring Telugu superstar Prabhas with prominent roles by
Amitabh Bachchan
and
Deepika Padukone
, made over Rs 290 crore just in Hindi language in June this year, according to trade website Sacnilk.
It is in stark contrast to 2023 when Bollywood registered four blockbusters in ""Pathaan"" and ""Jawan"", which raked in over Rs 1,000 crore each at the worldwide box office, as well as Sunny Deol's ""Gadar 2"" and Ranbir Kapoor's ""Animal"".
""I would not call it a bad year for Bollywood but yes if you compare to last year, we had four films crossing Rs 400 crore at the box office. This year has not been that great except for 'Stree 2' and 'Pushpa 2', which is a Telugu release.
""Box office can be unpredictable and there are phases. But there are lessons to be learned, we need to make films that cater to pan-India audiences. Bollywood will, hopefully, bounce back in a big way next year,"" trade analyst Taran Adarsh told PTI.
According to Amit Sharma, MD, Miraj Entertainment Ltd, 2024 was ""disastrous"" for Hindi cinema.
""The business is down by at least 30 per cent compared to 2023 where we had 'Pathaan', 'Gadar 2', 'Jawan', 'Animal', 'Dunki', 'Fukrey' and 'Dream Girl 2'... When it comes to Bollywood in 2024, you can't really speak about anything apart from 'Stree 2' and to an extent 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3' and 'Singham' and films like 'Laapata Ladies' and 'Shaitaan'. But commercially there is no comparison between 2024 and 2023,"" he told PTI.
Horror-comedy seemed to be the most successful genre in Bollywood as not just ""Stree 2"" but Kartik Aaryan's ""Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3"" and Maddock Films' ""Munjya"" also did decent business at the box office.
But the Hindi cinema's big bet on action movies, starting the year with ""Fighter"" failed to yield good results.
Directed by Siddharth Anand of ""Pathaan"" fame, ""Fighter"", starring
Hrithik Roshan
and Deepika Padukone, couldn't replicate the success of the 2023
Shah Rukh Khan
starrer.
The movie, made on a big budget, reportedly to be around Rs 250 crore, and featuring high octane action sequences, underperformed at the box office, earning Rs 212 crore in nett at the Indian box office, according to Sacnilk.
Ajay Devgn-starrer ""Singham Again"", the latest entry in filmmaker Rohit Shetty's cop universe, amassed just Rs 247 crore nett, did decent business but fell short of being a blockbuster.
The fact that the movie clashed with ""Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3"" in Diwali this year may have also impacted the business of the two movies. The films registered great opening day numbers but ran out of steam in just two weeks.
Other major disappointments at the ticket window were ""Yodha"" starring Sidharth Malhotra,
Akshay Kumar
's ""Bade Miyan Chote Miyan"", Devgn's ""Maidaan"" and Aaryan's ""Chandu Champion"" and Alia Bhatt-starrer ""Jigra"".
The dry run of Akshay's films at the box office continued after ""Bade Miyan Chote Miyan"" with both ""Sarfira"" and ""Khel Khel Mein"" not doing too well.
It was a good year for medium budget films like ""Shaitaan"", ""Munjya"" and ""Crew"" did profitable business at the box office.
""Shaitaan"", a horror film starring Devgn and R Madhavan, emerged as a surprise hit with a nett collection of Rs 148 crore.
""Crew"", a heist comedy starring Kareena Kapoor Khan, Tabu and Kriti Sanon, earned Rs 89 crore in net collection, almost double of its budget.
Amidst the lacklustre run of Hindi films at the ticket window, exhibitors relied on several old classics to fill the theatres.
Shah Rukh Khan's ""Karan Arjun"", ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"", ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" and ""Chak De! India"" returned to the big screen.
Anurag Kashyap's 2012 hit ""Gangs of Wasseypur"",
Salman Khan
's ""Maine Pyar Kiya"", ""Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein"", featuring Madhavan and Dia Mirza, as well as ""Rockstar"", ""Jab We Met"", ""Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani"" also made a comeback to theatres.
Audiences particularly embraced Imtiaz Ali-produced ""Laila Majnu"", starring Avinash Tiwary and Triptii Dimri, and actor-producer Sohum Shah's period mythological thriller ""Tumbbad"" as the two films performed better at the box office as compared to their initial run at the box office.
In a recent interview with PTI, actor Manoj Bajpayee admitted that Hindi cinema is going through a lull phase.
""It is definitely forcing filmmakers to think differently. And there is nothing wrong with it. I think it is a churning, it's a lull period. I'm hopeful that it will go back to its natural self very soon. I don't see it as a problem because creative people always find a way,"" he said.
Bajpayee believes that rising cost of cinema tickets is one of the reasons why people are not flocking to theatres to watch Hindi films en masse.
""The person who is going to the theatres, he is a mass guy and he can't afford the ticket of a multiplex. Our mass audience can't go to the multiplex but even if they are able to go there, they want to see 'Pathaan', 'Jawan' or 'Animal'.
""The single screens are running packed and their audience see their hero in Allu Arjun. He is giving them the kind of film that should be enjoyed in theatres,"" he added.

Indian brands capitalise on Netflix's Squid Game phenomenon,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/indian-brands-capitalise-on-netflixs-squid-game-phenomenon/articleshow/116715519.cms,27-12-2024,"Indian brands are capitalising on the popularity of Netflix’s
Squid Game Season 2
, which began streaming on 26 December, through strategic marketing collaborations. Brands such as Knorr,
Swiggy
Instamart, and Cadbury 5 Star have launched campaigns that align their products with the themes of the Korean series.

Bollywood’s dark past is threatening to return,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bollywoods-dark-past-is-threatening-to-return/articleshow/116697057.cms,27-12-2024,"Disaster. Flop. Average. If you had to bet on a
Bollywood movie
’s fate in 2024, those would have been your three best options in a year set to end with a 30% to 40% drop in
box-office collections
.
The world’s most prolific film industry is desperately hoping for a better 2025. And so are the city’s cops: When the theaters go empty, the body count starts to rise on the streets of Mumbai. That’s what the 1990s were like — and everyone’s dreading a repeat of lawlessness in India’s financial capital.
The fears are far from exaggerated. Baba Siddique, a local politician and real-estate developer who enjoyed close friendships with celebrity actors, was gunned down in October as he was about to get into his car. A member of the gang that claimed responsibility said in a Facebook post that “Bollywood, politics, and property dealings” were behind the murder.
Organized crime and the show business of Bombay — as the megalopolis was known until 1995 — have been joined at the hip for a long time. The Golden Age of Indian Cinema that began around the country’s 1947 independence from British rule had a 20-year run. Politics took a cynical turn in the late 1960s, and popular culture began to reflect the loss of idealism.
Bollywood
scripts shed the social concerns of a young republic and became the escapist fantasy the world knows today.
By the early 1970s, India was releasing hundreds of Hindi-language films. Banks wouldn’t finance them. That’s where the likes of Haji Mastan came in. One of Mumbai’s most powerful dons at the time, Mastan was a sucker for glamor. Dressed in all white, the stylish boss became something of a private-equity player for the entertainment business when he began to finance movies for his actress lover.

The mob had eked out its initial capital from the docks of Bombay, smuggling gold and electronics. As it reinvented itself for a more open economy in the 1980s and 1990s, bootlegging and extortion gave way to money-laundering, trafficking in drugs and guns ... and more cinema. Dons were no longer satisfied with a profit share, a 2003 report by the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies noted. They wanted “partnership by becoming producers and getting overseas rights for film and music distribution.”
Leading this change was
Dawood Ibrahim
, a policeman’s son who rose to prominence as the city’s most feared mobster in the post-Mastan era. Dawood began operating from Dubai in the mid-1980s, but his syndicate, known as the D Company, is believed to have carried out the assassination of the founder of T Series, a music-production powerhouse, in 1997.
That murder, as well as a subsequent attempt on the life of a producer — whose son Hrithik Roshan was the reigning teen heartthrob — shook the industry. Ibrahim’s suspected involvement in the deadly 1993 terror attack on Mumbai, in which 257 people were killed in a series of bomb blasts across the city, provided urgency to the cleanup. Bollywood has an entire crime noir dedicated to so-called encounter specialists, who would, instead of apprehending underworld operatives and producing them in court, simply execute them. One of my personal favorites is Ab Tak Chhappan, or “56 So Far,” a reference to the kill count.
Just when it looked like the city had escaped from that cycle of violence, there are fresh signs of unease. In February 2021, a car packed with explosives was found parked outside the home of Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest tycoon. An elite detective — a former “encounter specialist” — is awaiting trial in that case. While denying the ex-cop’s bail petition last year, a court said his aim was to spread terror in the mind of the
Ambani
family.
Siddique’s murder has deepened the foreboding. Police have invoked a harsh 1999 law designed to crush organized crime. But cops don’t know the underworld’s current level of engagement. “We must have made 20 to 25 films and earned profits, too,”
Chhota Shakeel
, an Ibrahim aide, had bragged in a 2001 interview, after authorities busted a high-profile case of the mafia’s movie-financing operations. “Instead of extorting money from film personalities, we thought we would do business with them.”
Have the proceeds of crime seeped in again, slipping through the veneers of Bollywood’s corporatization? It’s an important law-enforcement question. As the Indian investigative journalist Swati Chaturvedi wrote recently, “Nowhere else in the world does a film industry of this size face such organized threats.”
The repercussions go beyond showbiz. Lawrence Bishnoi, the leader of the group suspected of murdering Siddique, has been accused by the Canadian police of colluding with Indian government agents to kill and harass members of the country’s Sikh diaspora. A gangster who’s at the center of a diplomatic spat — and at the same time threatening to eliminate Salman Khan, one of India’s biggest film stars — adds a new dimension to the threat.
Arthouse Indian cinema has always felt smothered by kitsch. That has only gotten worse in recent years with right-wing propaganda films competing with the usual song-and-dance and action routines. But now Mumbai is losing control even on its signature over-the-top entertainers. Studios in the southern city of Hyderabad can lay claim to two of the biggest hits in a dull year. That is just like 1984 when the Mumbai industry’s dalliance with crime had begun to get serious. Meanwhile, the acclaimed drama All We Imagine as Light, nominated for two Golden Globes and the winner of this year’s Cannes Grand Prix, is struggling to find exhibitors at home.
A second-generation Mumbai producer recently sold half of his studio to Adar Poonawalla, the billionaire vaccine maker who earned handsome profits during Covid-19. The pandemic marked a crucial intermission. It fueled demand for original content people could stream at home on Netflix, Amazon Prime and homegrown apps like Hotstar+ when cinemas were under lockdown. Now everything is open, and yet audiences are so bored of the insipid fare on screens big and small, they’re neither out for a movie night, nor clicking through big-budget web dramas.
When everything starts bombing for Bollywood, things take a sinister turn in Mumbai.

NCLAT sets aside plea filed against NCLT order approving sale of Reliance Broadcast Network,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/nclat-sets-aside-plea-filed-against-nclt-order-approving-sale-of-reliance-broadcast-network/articleshow/116607018.cms,23-12-2024,"The
NCLAT
on Monday set aside a batch of appeals filed against the
NCLT
order approving bids of
Sapphire Media
for
Reliance Broadcast Network
Ltd. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) upheld the order of the Mumbai Bench of the NCLT, which had on May 6, 2024 approved the
resolution plan
of Sapphire Media for Reliance Broadcast that operated FM radio business under the brand name of Big 92.7 FM.
The order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) was challenged by the unsuccessful resolution applicants -- Abhijit Realtors & Infraventure and Creative Channel Advertising & Marketing -- by filing a batch of five appeals before NCLAT.
The petitioners had alleged irregularity in the process adopted by the resolution professional of Reliance Broadcast Network Ltd (RBNL), which was rejected by the appellate tribunal.
""We have already found that the challenge mechanism as well as negotiation conducted by the resolution professional is in accordance with the CIRP Regulations and Process Note,"" NCLAT said.
Moreover, evaluation of the eligibility of the successful bidder Sapphire Media also suggested there is no irregularity committed by the RP and that it ""does not find any tenable ground"" raised by them to interfere with the order approving the resolution plan.
Live Events
""....we do not find any ground to interfere in the order dated May 6, 2024 impugned in the above Appeals. In result, all the appeals are dismissed,"" it said.
The
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process
(CIRP) was initiated against Reliance Broadcast Network by NCLT on February 24, 2023 on an application filed by IDBI Trusteeship Services, a
financial creditor
of the company.
The RP received six resolution plans, where Abhijit Realtors & Infraventure submitted a bid of Rs 80.20 crore, Creative Channel Advertising & Marketing gave a bid of Rs 100 crore, Entertainment Network (India) of Rs.37.17 crore and Sapphire Media Ltd of Rs 104.28 crore.
The Committee of Creditors (CoC) decided to hold the challenge process as per the RFRP (Request-For-Resolution-Plan) and a base price of Rs 240 crore was set.
At the end of each round, the bid with the highest value was the ""Threshold Bid Amount"" for the next round. The resolution applicant was required to either match or exceed the threshold bid amount for the respective round in order to continue participating in the challenge process.
Each incremental bid of the resolution applicants was to be in multiples of Rs 10 crore. In the third round, Sapphire Media submitted a bid of Rs 251 crore, which was the highest.
After this, the CoC decided to undertake further negotiations with all resolution applicants as per the RFRP and to put their best offers and submit revised financial proposal.
On November 4, 2023, revised financial proposals were received from Consortium of Abhijit Realtors & Infraventure and ENIL (formed during the challenge round) of Rs 248 crore, Rs 240 crore from Creative Channel Advertising & Marketing, and Rs 261 crore from Sapphire Media.
The bid of Sapphire Media was approved by CoC with 88.97 per cent vote and was forwarded to NCLT, which approved it.
However, it was alleged that Sapphire Media was ineligible to submit its resolution plan and questioned the challenge process before NCLAT and it was rejected.

Shrinking pool of finance and creative challenges continue to impact fresh films' production,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/silver-screen-losing-shine-for-bollywood/articleshow/116574711.cms,23-12-2024,"Bollywood faced a tough 2024 grappling with poor performance of movies. But even as the year comes to a close, creative challenges and funding shortages continue to impact fresh content production.
A veteran producer, speaking anonymously, revealed, “Even as the year ends, no fresh films are starting production. Creatively, makers lack confidence in original scripts and are stuck re-writing or reviewing them. On the funding side, the financing pool has significantly shrunk, adding to the industry’s challenges.”
In 2024, concept-driven mid-sized Hindi films like Munjya, Stree 2, and Shaitaan exceeded trade expectations and became box office successes. In contrast, big-budget films like Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, Maidaan, and Fighter underperformed, struggling to attract audiences and falling short of trade circuit expectations. In 2024, according to Sacnilk, a box office data research firm, the total gross collection of Hindi films fell by 25.1% to Rs 4535.89 crore when compared to 2023.
Studios, typically producing 30 films annually and a key funding source for fresh Hindi films, have adopted a cautious wait-and-watch approach due to the poor performance of films in recent years.
Vikram Malhotra, founder & CEO, Abundantia Entertainment said, ""There is a growing absence of studios that can actively fund films. A few years ago, several studios were backing projects. But today, most, if not all of them, are either in full stop or in pause mode.” He added that this is a cause for grave concern as without these strategic players the industry cannot attain a sustainable scale.
Live Events
A wave of consolidation among major studios, including the merger of Star, Disney, and Viacom18, has reduced the number of studios financing films.
Global studios are also in wait-and-watch mode, prioritising home markets that yield higher revenues and subscriber growth over the Indian market.
Film funding through satellite or television rights has become a major challenge. A producer, speaking anonymously, explained, “Broadcasters are not investing in films as viewership has declined. The slowdown in advertising, shrinking pay-TV homes, and the growing popularity of streamers have forced channels to halve the prices they pay for films.”
Banks' interest in financing films has significantly declined. Industry veteran Sanjay Bhandari noted, “In the past seven years, public sector banks financed fewer than 10 films annually, compared to 20-25 films each year between 2001 and 2010.” He attributed this drop to poor Hindi film performance and outdated financing policies, with banks charging 10-12% interest rates on film loans.
The recourse to private financing, which largely includes individual financiers, is expensive for producers as these financiers charge two times the interest rates banks charge on film loans.
Amid these challenges, funding for fresh films now heavily relies on streaming and music rights. However, streamers, despite needing fresh content to retain subscribers, have become more selective. Their budgets for acquiring or commissioning films have dropped by 40% compared to pandemic levels, and the cost per film from producers has been slashed by 40-50%. As a result, streamers are backing only a limited number of fresh films.
Despite challenges, experts predict streaming platforms will remain a key source of film funding. The FICCI-EY 2024 report estimates a 20% growth in revenues from streaming rights sales, reaching Rs4,200 crore by 2026. Optimistic producers view the current financing crunch as temporary, expecting the landscape to improve within six months.
Tanuj Garg, managing partner, Ellipsis Entertainment, a production house, said, ""Once Zee5 is back and the merged Jio-Star entity enters the ring, we will be back to a full-throttled democratic market with more options, more players and more uptakes.” “Currently, there is disproportionate pressure on active players such as Netflix and Amazon Prime from filmmakers to seek financing from the sale of streaming rights,” he added.

The newly elected President, Kevin Vaz, remarked, “It is an honour to take on this responsibility at such a transformative time for the media and entertainment sector. India’s appetite for content is unmatched, making it a unique market where all forms of media continue to grow, while Indian content increasingly gains international recognition furthering India’s soft power globally. As we increasingly embrace technology to scale up, it is imperative that we democratize content creation so that it is not demographically or geographically limited. While India consumes content from anywhere, driven by the proliferation of 5G, smartphones, connected TVs and better Pay TV infrastructure, we must ensure that opportunities to create professional content from locations beyond the current hotspots is a viable future for the industry.”
He further emphasised that “the media and entertainment industry has a multiplier effect that extends to sectors like sports, creating significant opportunities for growth at scale. To ensure that this growth can be sustainable we need to look at business models rooted in equitable collaborations that foster value creation for all stakeholders across the ecosystem. I also look forward to work with the government and industry in developing progressive, soft-touch regulations that empower the sector to innovate and harness its full potential for sustainable growth.”
The IBDF has seen significant growth since its inception, expanding from seven members in 1999 to 60 members in 2021, representing nearly 400 channels.
These channels collectively account for about 90% of television viewership in India, catering to the nation’s diverse linguistic and cultural landscape across various genres.

Netflix India readying to get into the Ring with WWE in sports entertainment foray,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/netflix-india-readying-to-get-into-the-ring-with-wwe-in-sports-entertainment-foray/articleshow/116481363.cms,20-12-2024,"Sports entertainment powerhouse WWE is preparing to transfer its media rights in India from Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) to Netflix India as part of a global 10-year, $5 billion agreement that its owner, TKO Group Holdings, signed with the streaming platform earlier this year.
The transition, expected to start after March 2025, coincides with the expiration of WWE’s current deal with SPNI. In 2020, SPNI renewed the WWE media rights for an estimated $180-210 million over five years.
SPNI has been keen to retain TV rights despite the global Netflix deal, according to people familiar with the matter, as the property didn’t perform well on the digital platform during the ongoing rights cycle. However, Netflix is determined to maintain exclusivity in the Indian market, they said.
The partnership marks Netflix India’s entry into sports entertainment. While Netflix has been investing in live sports globally, including with the National Football League, its Indian operations have traditionally steered clear of sports, including cricket, which is the most-watched sport in the country across both television and digital platforms.
A Netflix India spokesperson confirmed that WWE content would be available on the platform starting in 2025. However, SPNI declined to comment on the matter.
Live Events
WWE programming has been a staple on Ten Sports in India since 2002. SPNI acquired the sports network in 2016 for $385 million from
Zee Entertainment
and subsequently rebranded it as Sony Ten. Across Ten Sports and Sony Sports, WWE’s partnership has lasted for more than two decades.
Beginning in January 2025, Netflix will exclusively stream WWE’s flagship shows—Raw, SmackDown and NXT—in major markets, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and South America. By April 2025, the deal will extend to India, a crucial market for WWE’s global aspirations.
Outlining Netflix’s approach to sports properties, co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently stated that the platform’s interest lies in unique, global and youth-oriented sports opportunities. He said sports leagues also seek to attract global and younger audiences for long-term success.
However, experts say that transitioning WWE’s loyal fanbase from linear television to a subscription-based streaming service could pose significant challenges, particularly in India, where television still dominates with 900 million viewers compared to 547 million streaming users.
For Netflix India, which currently boasts 12 million subscribers, this partnership represents a major step in expanding its subscriber base. It is expected to attract WWE’s dedicated fanbase, potentially driving significant subscription growth.
The loss of WWE presents a substantial challenge for SPNI, for which the brand has long been a cornerstone of its sports programming. Analysts suggest that SPNI will need to explore alternative content in the sports entertainment domain to retain its audience. It had recently secured the Asian Cricket Council rights for $170 million.
Netflix will also face fierce competition from established players such as Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema, which dominate India’s sports streaming landscape with premier offerings such as the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council tournaments.

"Pay-TV might be having a hard time now, but it's too early to write it off",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pay-tv-might-be-having-a-hard-time-now-but-its-too-early-to-write-it-off/articleshow/116448629.cms,19-12-2024,"Top broadcast industry leaders remain optimistic about the resilience of the
Indian pay-TV industry
, though the total paid subscriber base has fallen below 100 million for the first time since the advent of private satellite TV broadcasting three decades ago.
Experts said the pay-TV industry’s subscriber base has dropped to an estimated 95 million homes—a significant decline from 120 million just a few years ago—amid competition from over-the-top (OTT) platforms, Prasar Bharati’s free direct-to-home (DTH) service
DD Free Dish
, and Google-owned YouTube.
The availability of premium sports and entertainment content for free on streaming platforms has also played a role in denting the pay-TV market, they added.
In a recent interview with ET, Jio Star vice-chairman Uday Shankar said TV remains a dominant force in India and reports of its demise are premature. He also stated that there is significant opportunity to reinvent, revitalise, and make TV stronger and healthier.
“The decline in pay-TV numbers isn’t the full story. What really matters is the overall TV universe, including free TV (DD Free Dish), and that hasn’t come down. In a value-conscious market like India, if consumers don’t see enough value in pay-TV but find reasonable value in free TV, they’ll naturally migrate to free TV,” he said.
Live Events
Tata Play CEO Harit Nagpal said the pay-TV industry grew for over a decade, but in the last three to four years, pay content, including drama and sports, was offered for free on other media in real-time, presenting significant challenges.
“Sagging industry revenues led to cutting investments on content, denting growth even more. For the industry to grow again, windowing of content, just as cinema does, and doubling down on content to fight UGC will help,” he added.
While subscription-based streaming platforms continue to attract premium audiences, DD Free Dish is eroding the base by capturing bottom-tier customers.
YouTube, India’s largest free video streaming platform, is also having a major impact on the pay-TV market, cutting across audience segments.
Sony Pictures Networks India CEO Gaurav Banerjee, in an interview with ET, said the pay-TV market is extremely important for all broadcasters, including Sony, and as a content provider to distribution platform operators (DPOs), it can only ensure that the content it creates resonates with audiences.
“Pay-TV is going through a challenging phase globally and not just in India. But I think the pay-TV story in India will be different due to its affordability, and that will give pay-TV legs in this country,” he noted.
During its Q2 earnings call,
Zee Entertainment
CEO Goenka said that linear TV will remain relevant in this country for a long time, as it still provides massive reach to advertisers compared to digital. “India will always remain a TV and a digital market. It will not be a TV or a digital market, unlike the western parts of the world,” he noted.
As per industry estimates, linear TV reaches 900 million audiences compared to 540 million OTT audiences.
DPOs like Dish TV also say that the pay-TV market can be revived through timely interventions by the broadcasters and the regulator. They argued that broadcasters should avoid providing content for free on digital, whether through their own OTT platforms or telecom bundling.
They also suggested that the regulator should ensure parity between DTH and other DPOs by reducing the licence fee before phasing it out completely by FY27. This, they added, would lead to cost savings for DTH operators, which could then be reinvested into providing better services for end customers.
“Why will customers pay for TV channels if broadcasters are making premium content free on digital besides bundling content with telco packs? The price increase by broadcasters is also hurting pay-TV as customers today have multiple options like OTT, YouTube, and DD Free Dish,” said Dish TV CEO Manoj Dobhal.
Pay-TV’s decline began with the implementation of the new tariff order (NTO) and the subsequent increase in TV bills, followed by the Covid pandemic a year later, which accelerated consumer migration towards streaming platforms, said PWC Media and Entertainment Senior Advisor Rajesh Sethi.

"Blocked 18 OTT platforms for publishing obscene, vulgar content: Govt",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/blocked-18-ott-platforms-for-publishing-obscene-vulgar-content-govt/articleshow/116443743.cms,18-12-2024,"Government blocked 18
OTT platforms
this year for publishing obscene and vulgar content, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting
L Murugan
told the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
In a reply to a question by
Shiv Sena-UBT
member Anil Desai, Murugan said the IT Rules of 2021 cast specific due diligence obligations on intermediaries to make reasonable efforts by themselves against displaying or spreading obscene or pornographic content.
The Rules also provide for a Code of Ethics for publishers of news and current affairs on digital media and publishers of online curated content (OTT platforms).
""The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has taken action in coordination with various intermediaries, and blocked 18 OTT platforms on 14th March, 2024 for publishing obscene, vulgar, and, in some instances, pornographic content under these provisions,"" Murugan said.
In a reply to a separate question, Murugan said the Code of Ethics for
digital news publishers
requires such publishers to adhere to the 'Norms of Journalistic Conduct' of the Press Council of India, The Programme Code under the Cable Television (Network Regulation Act, 1995).
Live Events
Replying to another question, Murugan said the publishers of news and current affairs on digital media including YouTube news channels Bolta Hindustan and National Dastak are covered under the provisions of IT Rules, 2021, Part-III of which provides for issuance of directions for blocking of content covered under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act, 2000).
He said the rules also empowers the central government to issue directions to any government agency or an intermediary to block content in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to such matters.

"Bollywood's 2024 woes: Hindi films lose the plot as soaring star salaries, flops hit industry hard",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bollywoods-2024-woes-hindi-films-lose-the-plot-as-soaring-star-salaries-flops-hit-industry-hard/articleshow/116410387.cms,18-12-2024,"Bollywood’s 2024 story unfolded behind the scenes—soaring star salaries, flopping big-budget films, spiraling production costs, and a fixation on cost recovery over creativity and strong scripts have hit producers hard, leaving the industry searching for its plot.
The fallout? Few fresh big-budget films went into production, making 2024 a lacklustre year for the Hindi film industry compared to 2023.
According to Sacnilk, a box office research data firm, the total gross box office collection in 2024 to date is Rs 10754 crore. This is an 18.2% fall when compared to the total gross box office collection of Rs 13161 crore in 2023. Understandably, the fall is steeper when one takes into account the gross box office collection of Hindi films. The gross box office collection of Hindi films fell by 25% to Rs 4534.2 crore in 2024 when compared to 2023.
Ram Mirchandani, founder of Rampage Motion Pictures, a production house, said, ""Common sense must prevail. The focus must be on costs now. Stars, directors, and other artists must come together and take a realistic view of their remuneration. There must be a concerted effort at making a film financially viable.""
One of the key lessons of 2024 has been the budgeting of films. A common observation that a large number of producers share is that films that do not warrant high budgeting get over-budgeting because of the indulgence of stars and other stakeholders.
Live Events
Suniel Wadhwa, co-founder of Karmic Films and a veteran film distributor, said, ""A key lesson of 2024 is budgeting of films. Producers must keep the budgets of films under control. If a producer intends to engage in self-indulgent storytelling, then the film's talent must derive its remuneration from the film's profits.""
Due to over-budgeting and poorly written scripts, in 2024, a few big-budget films such as Bade Miyan Chote Miyan and Maidaan failed at the box office.
Another key lesson that 2024 has taught the industry is collaboration in funding and creativity. A veteran producer who wished to be unnamed said, ""Today, a production house cannot fund, create, or mount a film on its own. There is a great deal of uncertainty in the industry about what will work and what will not work at the box office."" He added, ""I think the approach must be to mitigate risks. Mid-sized and small-sized production houses must collaborate with big production houses either for creativity or funding.""
A positive development that sums up 2024 is the fading influence of stars in attracting audiences to theatres and the unexpected successes of films that were not headlined by big and marquee star names in the industry. In fact, 2024 has been a year that is defined by the success of
mid-budget films
such as Munjya, Shaitaan, and Stree 2. These films are a quintessential example of stories told well that found huge acceptance among audiences across states.
Girish Wankhede, a movie trade analyst, said, ""The exceptional success of Pushpa 2: The Rule in just the dubbed Hindi version alone (collected over Rs500 crore) shows that a large audience, which is important to theatres and stays in tier-II and tier-III cities, cannot be ignored or overlooked."" He added that makers have to focus on scripts that have more mass appeal, as mass audiences are more regular theatregoers and more unforgiving than audiences with refined tastes.
Lastly, avoiding a clash of two or more films on the same weekend is a big lesson of 2024 for the industry. Suniel Wadhwa of Karmic Films said, ""Competition between two or more films must be avoided. This is because the potential of each film is not realised fully at the box office.""

Sony Pictures Networks India open to M&As to address portfolio gaps: CEO,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/sony-pictures-networks-india-open-to-mas-to-address-portfolio-gaps-ceo/articleshow/116409613.cms,17-12-2024,"MUMBAI:
Sony Pictures Networks India
(SPNI), which abandoned a merger with
Zee Entertainment
earlier this year, is considering mergers and acquisitions (M&As) to address portfolio gaps while focusing on rebuilding by strengthening its TV and streaming brands, CEO
Gaurav Banerjee
told ET in his first interview since assuming the role.
Banerjee, who took charge in August, said SPNI has moved on since the collapse of the Zee deal and is open to exciting partnership opportunities, adding, “We are on the lookout.”
Reflecting on the failed merger with Zee, Banerjee admitted, “There has been some pain and frustration with the merger not going through. We walked away from that a year ago, and now, it’s time to focus on a new strategic direction.”
However, he said that his top priority is to grow
Sony Entertainment Television
(SET), the flagship Hindi general entertainment channel, calling it the cornerstone of the network’s success in India.
Banerjee, who previously worked with Disney Star, said his appointment as CEO and recent leadership changes aim to provide fresh direction, with India remaining a key market for Japan’s Sony Pictures Entertainment, SPNI's parent company.

He pointed to the company’s acquisition of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) media rights for $170 million and its upcoming content lineup as evidence of increased investment in India.
Having completed over 100 days in the role, Banerjee noted SET's revival, with its market share climbing from 50 to 89 GRPs?, a key metric for TV ad success. Alongside non-fiction hits like Kaun Banega Crorepati and Indian Idol, the network plans to roll out new fiction shows over the next six months, including the return of popular crime drama CID after a six-year hiatus.
Beyond entertainment, the network is optimistic about its sports offerings, including the Asia Cup, the India-England cricket series, tennis, and football. ""The big move there is to get a lot more visibility, better distribution on the back of top-end India cricket,"" Banerjee said.
On the streaming front, the company aims to position SonyLIV against giants like
Netflix
and
Prime Video
with a mix of non-fiction, sports, and web series.
“There’s a great opportunity to create non-fiction content that works across screens. It gives us a unique position in India’s streaming wars, combining live sports that don’t break the bank with distinctive non-fiction content unique to our brand,” Banerjee said.
On concerns about balancing investments and profitability, Banerjee remarked, ""They should happen together. And that's what I'm hopeful that my management team is able to do. It's our ambition to grow in this country, and that will need investments. And I have the mandate to do that.""
According to filings with the Registrar of Companies, SPNI's FY24 net profit declined 19% to ?839 crore, while revenue fell 3% to ?6,510 crore.
Since taking over, Banerjee has focused on understanding the organisation's dynamics. ""I need to build this company into an exciting company for amazing entertainment,"" he said.
Commenting on the Star India and Viacom18 merger, Banerjee acknowledged that the formation of JioStar has created a formidable player with scale and multiple offerings but emphasised that SPNI will stay focused on its own strengths.
He expressed optimism of the Indian advertising market rebounding in line with broader economic growth. He also said that India’s content distribution market is becoming increasingly fragmented due to the rise of streaming and free TV homes, impacting pay TV subscriptions, but remained bullish about the future of pay TV in the country.

"Tussle between promoters, shareholders not obstructing functioning: Dish TV CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tussle-between-promoters-shareholders-not-obstructing-functioning-dish-tv-ceo/articleshow/116408598.cms,17-12-2024,"The ongoing tussle between the promoters and shareholders at
Dish TV
does not obstruct the functioning of its management, and it is allowed to operate freely and nicely, its CEO and Executive Director Manoj Dobhal said on Tuesday. The management is putting its focus and energy into running the organisation, unfazed by what is happening at the board level, he said here during the launch of
Content India 2025
by Dish TV in partnership with UK-based C21Media.
""I have not seen any issues coming out of that in the operations of the organisation. So, we are unfazed, and we are isolated from what is happening at that level because that is not for us to decide or to ponder about,"" Dobhal told PTI.
Last week, shareholders of Dish TV rejected the proposal to appoint two independent directors to the board of direct-to-home service provider.
Dish TV investors have ousted more than 20 directors so far in the last three years over the demand for a special meeting. It has also been penalised by leading bourses NSE and BSE over its board strength several times.
When asked whether such a situation deters the management, Dobhal said: ""We do not want to put a lot of focus and energy into something which is not in our hands... we are responsible for running the organisation. We are adept at that, and we keep ourselves isolated from what is happening around"".
Live Events
He also appreciated the board and shareholders, who have allowed the management to operate freely and nicely, irrespective of what is happening at that end.
Subhash Chandra
's family-led promoter and promoter group holds a mere 4.04 per cent share in the company, and shareholders are seeking reconstitution of the board.
Dish TV is currently going through a transformation and moving towards becoming a content distribution company, having a strong presence in direct-to-home (DTH) television and OTT space through its
Watcho platform
.
Currently, over 90 per cent of the topline of Dish TV comes from the
DTH business
, as the Watcho platform is at its nascent stage. However, it expects that subsidiary alliances will definitely increase the revenue numbers.
Dobhal also said, ""DTH viewing and monetisation is going down but there is a hybrid ecosystem which is evolving at the same time"".
It is offering Super Family HSM a total of 201 channels aggressively at Rs 145 for TV, and at the same time, people are watching their content on the OTT platforms also.
""... although the pressure on the revenues would be there, but at the same time, we are building the parallel streams of revenue,"" he added.
Over average revenue per user (ARPU), Dobhal said that keeping in mind customers from the rural, mid-economy segment or lower economy segments, it has not increased the prices with the increase in the content cost of Dish TV.
""We have tried to absorb as much of it as possible, otherwise, we would have taken 20-30 per rise,"" he said.
""But, we are adding more layers of service to the customer. They can offer different services like Watcho, which is OTT.""
Currently, Dish TV has on its platform over 582 channels and services, along with 21 OTT apps.
As part of its endeavour to strengthen India's content ecosystem, Dish TV launched Content India 2025 in partnership with UK-based C21Media.
This will address the need to strengthen India's content ecosystem by fostering cross-border collaborations, encouraging innovation, and showcasing the country's unmatched capabilities in production, post-production, and content creation.
Slated for April 1-3, 2025, the three-day summit will pave the way for the full-fledged Content India 2026 event.
It is modelled on globally successful formats of partner companies C21Media's Content London and Content Americas. The event will combine a marketplace, conferences, and networking opportunities to bring together key stakeholders, including creators, producers, distributors, platforms, and channels.

Government issues advisory to OTT platforms on depictions of drug use,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/centre-warns-ott-platforms-against-inadvertent-promotion-of-drugs/articleshow/116391120.cms,17-12-2024,"The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) has issued an advisory to over-the-top (
OTT
) platforms regarding the portrayal of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in their content.
Citing concerns over the influence of such depictions on young and impressionable audiences, the government has called for greater responsibility in content creation and curation.
The advisory highlights that some streaming content inadvertently glamorises or glorifies the consumption of drugs, which could lead to harmful societal repercussions.
The MIB reminded OTT platforms of their obligations under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.
The advisory emphasises that platforms must avoid portraying
drug
use as fashionable or acceptable and ensure that content depicting such misuse carries appropriate disclaimers, warnings, and classification.
Live Events
It further encourages platforms to include educational messages highlighting the dangers of drug abuse and to create content showcasing its adverse effects on public health.
The ministry also warned that promoting or glamorising drug use could be deemed an abetment to its consumption under Section 29 of the NDPS Act, attracting legal scrutiny.
OTT platforms have been urged to voluntarily comply with these guidelines to safeguard public interests. The advisory underscored the platforms’ social responsibility in shaping public opinion and fostering a safe digital environment.

, the legend of
Indian cinema
, created a body of work that remains iconic with films that hold a special place in the hearts of audiences even today. As the country celebrates the birth centenary of the filmmaker-actor on Saturday, here is a look at some of his most celebrated films.
*""Neel Kamal"" (1947): Raj Kapoor debuted as a male lead in ""Neel Kamal"", where he portrayed a stone craft artist caught in a love triangle with two exiled princesses, played by Begum Para and Madhubala. The film was a moderate success at the box office.
It came 12 years after the actor started his career as a child artist, first appearing in his father
Prithviraj Kapoor
's film ""Inquilab"".
*""Aag"" (1948): ""Aag"", a story about a man obsessed with theatre and in search of the leading lady for his play, marked Raj Kapoor's illustrious journey behind the camera.
The film also featured his brother Shashi Kapoor as the younger version of his character, along with Nargis, Premnath, Nigar Sultana, and Kamini Kaushal.
Live Events
*""Barsaat"" (1949): Raj Kapoor's second directorial effort solidified his stature as a filmmaker. The film's romantic saga, timeless music, and Raj Kapoor's chemistry with co-star Nargis made it a classic.
The film's popular tracks, including ""Hawa Mein Udta Jaye"" and ""Jiya Beqarar Hai"", were sung by the melody queen Lata Mangeshkar.
*""Awara"" (1951): One of Raj Kapoor's most remarkable films, ""Awara"" showcased his versatility as an actor and filmmaker. The movie is still remembered for its evergreen song ""
Awara
Hoon"", which became popular overseas, especially in China and the Soviet Union.
Raj Kapoor drew inspiration from Charlie Chaplin's ""Tramp"" persona, blending vulnerability, charm, and social commentary to reflect the struggles of the common man. The movie also featured his father, Prithviraj Kapoor.
*""Shree 420"" (1955): Directed by Raj Kapoor, who once again starred alongside Nargis, ""Shree 420"" told the story of a small-town man who comes to make it big in the city and is lured into a life of corruption and deceit when he starts working for the wealthy businessman.
The film's famous track ""Mera Joota Hai Japani"" highlighted themes of unemployment, poverty, and national pride, while soulful melodies like ""Ramaiya Vastavaiya"" and ""Pyar Hua Ikrar Hua"" beautifully captured the essence of love.
*""Chori Chori"" (1956): A romantic comedy loosely inspired by the 1934 American film ""It Happened One Night"", ""Chori Chori"" showcased Raj Kapoor's multi-faceted persona as an actor.
Songs like ""Panchhi Banoon Udti Phiroon"", ""Yeh Raat Bheegi Bheegi"", and ""Us Paar Sajan"" became major hits.
Mahesh Bhatt remade the film in 1991 as ""Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin"", starring Pooja Bhatt and
Aamir Khan
.
*""Jagte Raho"" (1956): This critically acclaimed film, directed by Amit Maitra and Sombhu Mitra, revolved around a poor peasant, played by Raj Kapoor, who is mistaken for a thief after entering a house in search of water.
The film, also produced by Raj Kapoor, made a strong political commentary on the rich-poor divide and featured memorable songs like ""Jaago Mohan Pyaare"" and ""Maine Jo Li Angdayi"".
*""Anari"" (1959): A delightful romantic comedy, ""Anari"" earned Raj Kapoor the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for performances as an innocent man falsely accused of poisoning his landlady. Directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and co-starring Nutan, the film was both a commercial and critical success.
Popular tracks from the film include ""Kisi Ki Muskurahaton Pe Ho"", ""Sab Kuch Seekha Humne"", and ""Woh Chand Khila"".
*""Sangam"" (1964): Regarded as Raj Kapoor's first full-colour film, ""Sangam"" showcased one of his finest performances. It featured him alongside Vyjayanthimala and Rajendra Kumar in a complex love triangle.
The film's songs are timeless, with melodies like ""Bol Radha Bol"", ""O Mehbooba"" and ""O Mere Sanam"" beautifully capturing love and longing, while ""Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega"" became an anthem for romance. ""Dost Dost Na Raha"" poignantly expressed heartbreak and betrayal.
*""
Mera Naam Joker
"" (1970): ""Mera Naam Joker"" was directed, edited, and produced by Raj Kapoor, who also played the lead role. The film was made on a massive budget and flopped badly at the box office, only to be declared a classic years later.

Pushpa 2: The Rule
has been released in more than 6000 screens in India alone, said trade analysts. They estimate that the film has been released in close to 2000 screens in overseas markets.
Ameya Naik, founder-Fantasy Films, an event management company, said, “The film has resonated deeply with the tier-II and tier-III audiences. This is even truer for Hindi heartland audiences. It meets all the criteria of a masala entertainer.” He added, “In the past one and a half decades, Telugu heroes have become like poets who are equally loved in translation by audiences outside their states.”

Themes such as fight against oppression, caste and class divides, justice, family as a binding unit and surviving against all odds have resonated with audiences beyond the southern states. Besides this, aggressive marketing in the northern region and increasing curiosity about the sequel have added to the huge footfalls in non-southern states.
According to trade analysts, more than 90% of shows in the non-southern states have been allocated to
Pushpa 2: The Rule
. A favourable factor which has worked for the film is high ticket prices. It is estimated that exhibitors have increased ticket prices by 30-40% from the usual ticket prices. This has added to the increasing contribution of the Hindi dubbed collection to the total collection in all languages.
Exhibitors and trade analysts estimate that the film can collect Rs1100-1200 crore in all languages since it has no competition at least for the next eleven days.

Parliamentary Panel to discuss OTT content with industry bodies,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/parliamentary-panel-to-discuss-ott-content-with-industry-bodies/articleshow/116192782.cms,11-12-2024,"The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology has invited industry bodies, including the
Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association
and the America's Motion Picture Association, which has an office in India, to present their views on the issue of over-the-top (OTT) content on December 20.
The committee, chaired by Lok Sabha member
Nishikant Dubey
, will deliberate on the topic, ""
Emergence of OTT Platforms
and Related Issues,"" with representatives from these associations.
This development follows Information and Broadcasting Minister
Ashwini Vaishnaw
's request for the parliamentary standing committee to take up the issue of strengthening existing laws governing social media and OTT platforms on a priority basis.
Dubey emphasised the increasing concerns about OTT content, particularly regarding obscenity and vulgarity. ""We have scheduled a meeting with industry stakeholders on December 20 to address OTT-related issues. The I&B Minister himself stated in the Lok Sabha that the IT committee should prioritise this matter. OTT platforms often feature content that raises issues such as the portrayal of women, obscenity, and vulgarity, making it unsuitable for family viewing,"" he said.
Last month in the Lok Sabha, Vaishnaw highlighted the urgency of strengthening existing laws to address challenges posed by social media and OTT platforms. He stressed the need for a societal consensus and stricter regulations, given the stark cultural differences between India and the regions where these OTT platforms originated in a reference to Netflix and Prime Video.

Apart from obscenity, some web series have sparked government concerns over alleged inaccurate portrayal. For instance, Netflix's series IC-814—The Kandahar Hijack, which dramatises the 1999 Indian Airlines hijacking, faced criticism for alleged inaccuracies, including altered names of the hijackers. Subsequently, Netflix agreed to update the disclaimer, clarifying the real and code names of the hijackers.
A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had told ET that if foreign streaming platforms continue such practices, the MIB will be compelled to implement stricter content regulations for OTT platforms, potentially including pre-certification requirements.
Amid the controversies over OTT content, industry bodies like the Indian Digital Media Industry Foundation (IDMIF) and the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) have advocated for retaining self-regulation under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.
IDMIF, an OTT self-regulatory body under the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF), maintains that the current self-regulatory framework effectively addresses content issues and grievance redressal mechanisms.
In their comments on the draft Broadcast Bill 2023, IBDF and IAMAI emphasised that platform-level self-regulation, overseen by an industry body, balances creative freedom and adherence to constitutional limitations. The industry bodies had also urged the ministry to keep OTT outside the ambit of the proposed since they are already complying with the IT Rules 2021.
In August 2023, IDMIF and IAMAI informed the MIB that their OTT members are complying with IT Rules even before releasing content. Both organisations assured the ministry that OCCPs rigorously ensure content adheres to the IT Rules’ Code of Ethics, avoiding content harmful to India’s sovereignty, security, public order, or international relations. Additionally, OCCPs are mindful of India’s diversity and exercise caution in portraying racial or religious groups, they noted.

Top 5 broadcasters' revenues up in FY24 despite challenging ad market,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/top-5-broadcasters-revenues-up-in-fy24-despite-challenging-ad-market/articleshow/116148573.cms,10-12-2024,"Mumbai: The combined revenue of India’s top five broadcasters increased over 5% to ₹41,412 crore in the fiscal year ended March 31, compared with ₹39,288 crore in the previous year, according to regulatory filings by these companies.
These broadcasters are
Star India
, Network18's entertainment business Viacom18,
Zee Entertainment
, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) and
Sun TV Network
. Star and Viacom18 have since merged their businesses to form a media conglomerate, JioStar.
The broadcasters posted a 6.3% increase in combined ad revenue, reaching ₹23,570 crore in FY24. Subscription revenue grew moderately by 4.2% to ₹17,842 crore. Barring Network18, the ad revenue of broadcasters remained under pressure. However, the growth in subscription revenue provided some relief amid a challenging advertising market.
Network18’s ad revenue growth was largely driven by sports, particularly the Indian Premier League which was live-streamed on JioCinema.
As per regulatory filings, Star India’s ad revenue declined 4% to ₹10,736 crore, while its subscription revenue fell 1.3% to ₹6,909 crore. Zee Entertainment’s ad revenue remained flat at ₹4,057 crore, while its subscription revenue increased 9.9% to ₹3,666 crore.
Live Events
Network18’s estimated ad revenue from its entertainment business, including Viacom18, more than doubled to ₹4,506 crore. The company’s subscription revenue, which also included its TV news business, rose 9% to ₹2,107 crore. Network18 and Viacom18 do not provide a detailed breakdown of ad and subscription revenues.
SPNI and Sun TV recorded modest growth in subscription revenue, but faced declines in ad earnings. SPNI’s ad revenue fell over 11% to ₹2,912 crore, while subscription revenue rose 7% to ₹3,346 crore. Sun TV’s standalone ad revenue decreased by 4% to ₹1,359 crore, while subscription revenue increased 5.4% to ₹1,814 crore.
“During the year, linear TV faced a subdued ad environment, primarily due to curtailed spending by FMCG brands and lower revenue from gaming and direct-to-consumer brands,” said Zee Entertainment CEO Punit Goenka in the company's FY24 annual report. He added that the implementation of New Tariff Order 3.0 in February 2023 partially offset the decline in ad revenue by allowing a subscription price increase aligned with inflation.
SPNI reported a 19% year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit to ₹839 crore in FY24. Revenue from operations fell 3% to ₹6,510 crore.
Walt Disney-owned Star India reported a net loss of ₹12,548 crore for the fiscal year ended 31 March. In its regulatory filing, the broadcaster attributed ₹12,319 crore of the loss to a provision for an ""onerous contract"" related to the International Cricket Council media rights deal. The company’s operating revenue declined by over 6% to ₹18,587 crore.
Network18's entertainment revenue surged 59% to ₹7,420 crore. However, the company reported an operating Ebitda loss of ₹677 crore, compared with an operating Ebitda of ₹124 crore in the previous fiscal year.
Sun TV's standalone net profit rose 12% to Rs 1,875 crore while total income surged 15% to Rs 4,630 crore.

Entertainment
and
Media
(E&M) industry is projected to outpace global growth, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.3% to reach Rs 3,65,000 crore by 2028, compared to the global E&M industry’s CAGR of 4.6%, according to PwC India’s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2024–28: India Perspective.
India’s demographic and economic advantages, including improved
internet connectivity
,
affordable data
, and supportive government policies, are driving this growth. With 91 crore millennials and Gen Zs, 78 crore internet users, and 80 crore broadband subscriptions, India is uniquely positioned to capitalise on E&M innovations.
The
advertising
market is forecasted to grow at a 9.4% CAGR, reaching Rs 1,58,000 crore by 2028, 1.4 times the global average. Digital advertising, the fastest-growing segment, will expand at a 15.6% CAGR to Rs 85,000 crore by 2028.
India, the fastest-growing OTT market globally, is expected to grow at a 14.9% CAGR, doubling revenue from Rs 17,496 crore in 2023 to Rs 35,100 crore by 2028.
Live Events
Traditional TV advertising is forecasted to grow at a 4.2% CAGR between 2023 and 2028, while global revenues are projected to decline by 1.6%. By 2026, India is expected to become the fourth-largest TV advertising market.
Gaming and esports revenue is projected to grow from Rs 33,000 crore in 2023 to Rs 66,000 crore by 2028, at a 14.5% CAGR. Cinema revenue will expand at a 14.1% CAGR, while music is expected to grow at a 10.3% CAGR, reaching Rs 10,899 crore by 2028. Print advertising, despite global declines, will grow by 3% in India.
The report highlights significant opportunities for growth and innovation. Internet advertising can benefit from regulatory compliance and advanced data analytics. OTT platforms are poised for further growth through innovations such as ad-supported models and regional narratives that enhance user engagement.
The gaming sector, supported by responsible gaming practices and investments in high-quality AAA games, is set to secure India’s global prominence. Generative AI is expected to revolutionize content creation and personalisation, with over 70% of global companies projected to adopt it by 2025. Early adoption of GenAI in India can enable hyper-personalized content and dynamic advertising campaigns.
The Indian government is supporting the E&M sector through initiatives like the WAVES summit, aimed at fostering global collaboration and innovation. Improved infrastructure has also accelerated the growth of out-of-home (OOH) advertising and other E&M segments.
Manpreet Singh Ahuja, Chief Digital Officer and TMT Leader at PwC India, stated, “India’s Entertainment & Media sector is on the cusp of a major transformation. According to our 'Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2024–2028', key growth drivers such as digital advertising, OTT platforms, online gaming, and Generative AI are shaping the future of the industry. These rapidly expanding segments are positioning India as a global leader in innovation and growth. Businesses that adapt and innovate in these areas are poised to seize unparalleled opportunities in this dynamic landscape.”
The report also recommends strategies for companies to enhance success. Consolidation among regional or niche players through mergers and acquisitions can help increase scale and efficiency. Social media can be leveraged effectively for content promotion and distribution.
Innovations in content strategies, including esports, online gaming, and indigenous sports, will address changing consumer behaviors. Investments in analytics, audits, and automation are essential for cost optimisation, while GenAI offers new opportunities for creating hyper-personalised content and enhancing user experiences, especially for regional players aiming to match global technological standards.

The Hindi version of ""Pushpa 2"", whose trailer was launched by Arjun and Rashmika Mandanna in Patna last month, also smashed records as it earned Rs 72 crore net on day one, surpassing the opening day figure of Shah Rukh Khan's 2023 hit ""Jawan"", whose Hindi version had earned around Rs 65 crore on day one.
In the sequel, Arjun returns as labourer-turned-sandalwood smuggler Pushpa Raj, alongside Mandanna as Srivalli and Fahadh Faasil as SP Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat.
The original film, directed by Sukumar and produced by Mythri Movie Makers, was not only a commercial success, amassing over Rs 300 crore in India, but also established a strong fan base beyond the traditional Telugu base and it has only grown since then.

Pushpa 2: The Rule — A box office phenomenon set to shatter business blues,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pushpa-2-the-rule-allu-arjun-rashmika-mandana-box-office-business-booking-tickets-multiplex-pvr-a-box-office-phenomenon-set-to-shatter-business-blues-pushpa-2-hindi/articleshow/116067574.cms,07-12-2024,"Pushpa 2 Business
: The release of Pushpa 2: The Rule has set the stage for one of the most significant cinematic events of 2024. Directed by Sukumar and starring Allu Arjun, the sequel to the 2021 blockbuster has not only shattered box office records on opening days but also reignited the business prospects for an otherwise struggling Indian film industry. With an opening collection of hundreds of crores, the film's impact extends beyond entertainment, providing much-needed momentum to exhibitors, multiplex operators, and the overall cinematic economy.
Audiences were thrilled to see Allu Arjun reprise his iconic role as Pushpa Raj after a three-year wait since the first film's release. Just hours after its release,
Pushpa 2 was leaked online across multiple piracy sites
. However, that failed to stop the euphoria for Pushpa 2 in theatres.
Pushpa 2: success shown in numbers
Pushpa 2
debuted with a historic opening day, reportedly collecting ₹175 crore across all languages in India. The second day added ₹90.1 crore to the domestic tally, bringing the two-day total to ₹265 crore. Globally, the film grossed ₹417.5 crore within 48 hours, making it the first Indian movie to achieve this feat in such a short span.
The Hindi version played a pivotal role, contributing ₹125.3 crore in two days, surpassing the Telugu version's ₹118.05 crore. Other language versions, including Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada, collectively added ₹33.1 crore, underscoring the movie's pan-Indian appeal.
Pushpa 2's strategic importance for 2024’s box office
The Indian film industry's 2024 performance has been marked by volatility, with mega success of Stree 2 followed by some notable successes like Singham Again and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 contrasting sharply with underwhelming results from big-budget ventures like Bade Miyan Chote Miyan. Against this backdrop, Pushpa 2 emerges as a critical lifeline. Analysts predict the film's lifetime collections could surpass ₹1,200–₹1,400 crore globally, significantly boosting the year's overall box office revenue.

Trade expert Girsh Wankhede remarked, “The Hindi dubbed version alone is expected to contribute at least 40% of the total revenue. This marks a sharp increase from the 26% contribution of Pushpa: The Rise in 2021.” The film's widespread popularity across regions highlights the growing acceptance of cross-regional cinema in India.
Girish Wankhede, a movie trade analyst, told ET, ""Production houses have been working on thin margins. Earlier, a hit film would recover the losses of four flop films. Today, a flop film wipes out the gains from four hit films. This shows production houses are not making enough money on their investments.""
The film industry is expected to see a steady wave of consolidation in the coming months, driven by rising operational costs and growing interest from large and mid-sized corporations in the entertainment sector.

Pushpa 2 bookings and revenue potential
The excitement for Pushpa 2 was evident even before its release, with over 32 lakh tickets sold in advance, generating ₹106 crore in pre-sales. Ticket prices for the film were set 30–40% higher than usual, reflecting the high demand and consumer willingness to pay a premium for the experience. Industry insiders estimate that the film could drive up theatre occupancy rates to 40% in December, offering a significant boost to multiplex operators like PVR INOX.
Amit Sharma, Managing Director at Miraj Entertainment, stated, “The Hindi dubbed version could contribute ₹800 crore to the total collection, accounting for 65–70% of its revenue. This film is not just a hit; it's a phenomenon reshaping the business dynamics of Indian cinema.”
Pushpa 2's impact on multiplex chains and stakeholders
Multiplex operators like PVR INOX stand to benefit immensely from Pushpa 2’s success. Analysts at Elara Securities predict a 33% quarter-on-quarter growth in Hindi gross box office collections in Q3FY25, with the film alone driving a significant portion of this growth. PVR INOX, which holds a 33% share in India’s Hindi GBOC, is expected to gross ₹560 crore from Hindi films in the quarter.
“The success of Pushpa 2 could restore theatre occupancies to pre-COVID levels, enhancing profitability and investor confidence,” noted Karan Taurani, an analyst at Elara Capital.

PVR Inox reported a consolidated net loss
of ₹12 crore for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, a significant drop from the ₹166 crore net profit recorded in the same quarter last year.
The company’s revenue from operations during the quarter was ₹1,622 crore, marking a 19% decline from ₹2,000 crore reported in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.
Elara has expressed optimism for the coming year, citing a strong lineup of Hollywood releases and Hindi sequels featuring megastars. The brokerage has set a buy target price of ₹1,950 for PVR Inox, based on a 13.8x one-year forward EV/EBITDA valuation.

Pushpa 2's cross-regional appeal and marketing strategy
The widespread success of Pushpa 2 is attributed not only to its cinematic brilliance but also to its robust marketing strategy. The makers re-released Pushpa: The Rise to rekindle interest in the franchise and embarked on an extensive promotional tour. In Bihar, the Hindi-speaking heartland, trailer launches and fan events created a frenzy, further solidifying its foothold in non-Telugu markets.
“95% of shows in non-southern markets are allocated to the Hindi version, driven by strong positive trends,” film distributor Shaaminder Malik told ET. This strategy highlights the film’s deliberate focus on expanding its reach beyond the southern states.
While the first installment of the franchise grossed ₹393.5 crore globally, Pushpa 2 is poised to exceed those figures by a significant margin. The sequel has already surpassed Baahubali 2 in advance booking revenues and is on track to rival the lifetime collections of KGF: Chapter 2 and Pathaan.
Elara Securities anticipates that Pushpa 2 will not only break box office records but also elevate Hindi cinemas' gross collections, further closing the revenue gap left by earlier underperforming releases.

Netflix breathes life into Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude as adaptation hits screens in Havana,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/netflix-breathes-life-into-gabriel-garca-mrquezs-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-as-adaptation-hits-screens-in-havana/articleshow/116045251.cms,06-12-2024,"Outside the Yara cinema in Havana, preparations were underway on Friday for the screening of
One Hundred Years of Solitude
, the first-ever TV adaptation of
Gabriel García Márquez
's beloved novel. The adaptation, a monumental project led by
Netflix
, marks a significant moment in Latin American media and is filmed entirely in
Colombia
.
Despite the challenges of limited access to streaming platforms like Netflix in Cuba, the first two episodes of the 16-episode series will be presented at the
Havana Film Festival
.
The novel, first published in 1967, tells the epic story of the Buendía family and the town of Macondo, blending magical realism with a vivid portrayal of Latin American culture and history.
Director
Alex García López
, who co-directed Part 1 with Laura Mora, shared with Reuters how reading the novel in his youth left a profound impact on him. He recalled how it resonated not only as a family saga but as a story about a country, a continent, and the human experience itself. For García López, the novel's central question revolves around whether humanity can break free from the cycle of repeating mistakes across generations, or if we are doomed to our destiny.
""The book is incredibly human,"" he told Reuters, drawing parallels between the themes of García Márquez's work and the growing political polarization seen in the United States and Europe today. ""It captured those same dynamics back in 1967, and it's just as relevant today.""
Live Events
Márquez and films
One Hundred Years of Solitude
is regarded as a masterpiece of magical realism and is one of the defining works of the Latin American Boom literary movement, which brought the region’s literature to global prominence. The novel chronicles the lives of the Buendía family across seven generations, using fantastical elements to explore deeply human themes of love, power, fate, and memory.
The adaptation, which features lush landscapes from Colombia’s Caribbean coast and period-appropriate 19th-century costumes, has already generated excitement through its promotional videos.
García Márquez, who passed away in 2014, had long been reluctant to allow his novel to be adapted for Hollywood-style productions, but Netflix’s approach persuaded his family. The streaming giant committed to producing the series entirely in Colombia and in Spanish, making it a unique, faithful adaptation.
Francisco Ramos, Netflix’s Vice President of Latin American content, explained that the agreement with García Márquez’s sons was ""very straightforward."" The author’s sons are credited as executive producers on the show. Ramos emphasised that adapting a literary masterpiece was a significant challenge, but he was confident in the immense talent within Latin America, particularly in Colombia.
""Adapting a masterpiece is a huge challenge...We never had any doubt the enormous talent from Latin America - in this case mostly from Colombia - would be up to the task. They just needed the support and opportunity,"" he told Reuters.
Netflix's loyalty to Latin American
The series is part of Netflix's broader strategy to invest in and promote Latin American content. In addition to
One Hundred Years of Solitude
, Netflix has recently released a film adaptation of Juan Rulfo’s
Pedro Páramo
and is working on future adaptations of works by Mexican authors Jorge Ibargüengoitia and Ángeles Mastretta, as well as Colombian writer Laura Restrepo.
While Netflix is well-known for its popular crime dramas set in Latin America, such as
Narcos
and
Griselda
, García López pointed out that this adaptation of
One Hundred Years of Solitude
is part of a broader effort to show a different side of Latin America — one that is rich in culture, history, and human complexity.
""We almost always export these stories of drug traffickers, illegal immigration, poverty, and dictatorships,"" García López said. “We want to show the world that we are more than what they know us for.""
With
One Hundred Years of Solitude
, Netflix hopes to share a more nuanced, deeply human portrait of Latin America, offering viewers a glimpse into the magical and political worlds of García Márquez’s masterpiece. The series promises to captivate audiences not just with its story, but with its bold, authentic portrayal of the region’s identity.

"Dua Lipa, Coldplay & Ed Sheeran's India jam sessions may add extra groove to economy",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/dua-lipa-coldplay-ed-sheerans-india-jam-sessions-may-add-extra-groove-to-economy/articleshow/116038745.cms,06-12-2024,"India's booming middle class and their growing love for live entertainment are drawing top international music acts, eager to tap into the country's vast, young audience. In the past week alone, Dua Lipa and Maroon 5 performed in Mumbai, while Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, and Green Day are all scheduled to perform in the coming months.
""We've been listening to these artists online for years so seeing them in real life is quite exciting,""  23-year-old Aseem Khan from Bhopal, who was among the 20,000 fans at Dua Lipa's Mumbai concert told Reuters.
Like Khan, many attendees were in their 20s and had traveled from all over India for the show. With two-thirds of the country’s 1.4 billion population under 35, the appetite for live music is sky-high.
Khan added that concerts are the perfect way to spend a weekend with friends—everyone’s going to them these days.
In fact, as a part of their
Music of the Spheres
World Tour, Coldplay announced a fourth concert in India, adding Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium to their tour schedule. The new date was January 25, 2025, marking an additional stop in what promises to be a star-studded tour.
Live Events
BookMyShow data shows that there have been 27,000 live events, from music to comedy shows and theatre, in India so far this year to November, 35% more than in the same period last year.
Concerts to boost economy?
""India is the second largest audio streaming market for most global artists around the world, translating very effectively to heightened demand on-ground for music concerts,"" Anil Makhija, chief operating office for at BookMyShow, told Reuters. ""Tier 2 and 3 cities are now the thriving hubs for out-of-home entertainment,"" she added.
Meanwhile, concerts in India are set to drive increased spending, offering a significant boost to private final consumption expenditure, according to a report from Bank of Baroda. Key sectors like hospitality, transportation, and retail are especially expected to see substantial growth.
The surge in concert-related spending reached Rs 771 crore in ticket sales as of December 4, while sponsorships, transport, hotels, and food & beverage sectors follow with notable contributions. Additionally, tax collections will rise due to GST on ticket sales and related services.
""What's been interesting the last few years is that it's gone from us saying, 'Hey, you ever think about India?' To them (artists) saying, 'Hey, I want to go to India,'"" Adam Wilkes, president and chief executive for Asia Pacific at AEG, a live entertainment firm told Reuters.
Growing appetite for live entertainment
Affluent Indians, particularly those with disposable income, are flocking to live events, fuelling a boom in the sector. This is happening even as India’s average per capita income hovers at around $2,500 a year, and income inequality remains significant.
However, the number of high earners in India has been rising rapidly. According to government data, over 12 million Indians now earn more than Rs 1 million ($11,808) annually—a number that has more than doubled over the last five financial years. This growing demographic is helping to drive the live entertainment boom, with consumers willing to pay for high-quality, international performances.
The rising demand is evident with ticket sales for upcoming events. For instance, tickets for Coldplay’s 2025 shows in India are priced between 2,500 rupees ($29.50) and 35,000 rupees ($414). This is significantly cheaper than the price range for their shows in South Korea, which ranged from $46.63 to $761.
The band’s initial two shows sold out in minutes, leading them to add three more dates, including two in Ahmedabad, where Coldplay will perform at a massive 130,000-seat stadium. Announcing the Ahmedabad shows, the band declared they would be their ""biggest ever show,"" highlighting the growing demand beyond India’s major metropolitan areas.

Prime Focus Technologies

Pocket FM
collectively received foreign direct investment (FDI) totalling more than Rs 1,100 crore from their foreign entities during the second quarter ended September 30.
According to data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Prime Focus Technologies (PFT), an AI-powered media tech company, secured Rs 742 crore from its holding company, DNEG S.a.r.l., based in Luxembourg.
In July, DNEG, an indirect subsidiary of Mumbai-based Prime Focus Ltd (PFL), secured $200 million in funding from Abu Dhabi-based investor United Al Saqer Group at a valuation of $2 billion. At that time, DNEG also completed the acquisition of PFT from its parent, PFL.

""Israel and India share deep cultural & historical similarities and Israeli content is being loved in India & across the world. Cinema has a remarkable potential to engage and with the Indian film industry poised to captivate the world, we are constantly on the lookout for new locations & fresh stories,"" Mittra told PTI.
""I am happy to be visiting Israel and keenly exploring synergies & partnership in
film co-production
and other areas pertaining to branding and the arts,"" he said.

The visit was made possible with the support and funding of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, together with the Israeli consulate in Mumbai and the embassy in New Delhi, ""showcasing the resilience of
cultural diplomacy
under difficult circumstances,"" an Israeli official said.
A conference was also organised by the Israeli Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Diaspora Affairs where the delegation engaged with leading Israeli production companies to foster collaboration on joint projects.
Garika Tejeswar, a senior diplomat at the Indian embassy in Israel, also participated in a session and highlighted the benefits of Israeli-Indian collaborations, including possibilities of availing incentives extended by the Indian government, wide ranging shooting options provided by stunning locations across the country, a readily available ecosystem, and successful co-productions.
In his presentation, Israeli producer Elad Peleg focussed on the country's diverse filming locations, emphasising its compact geography that offers varied landscapes ranging from Mount Hermon's snowy peaks to the southern desert-all within a short travel distance.
The Indian delegation met with dozens of Israeli production companies, film funds, and broadcasters to explore partnerships.
They also met ""Fauda"" star Tsahi Halevi, who is set to feature in a major Israeli-Indian co-production currently in development.
Tsahi had also played a key role in Bollywood film ""Akelli"", starring Nushrratt Bharuccha.
Israel also showcased its technological expertise in the creative industry with the delegation visiting The Hive, an animation company with a record of Oscar-nominated films, and Lightricks, an AI company based at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, discussing potential partnerships.
Traveling to the north of Israel, the delegation met Yona Yahav, the Mayor of Haifa, visited the
Haifa
Historical Society, where they watched a presentation on the ""Hero of Haifa"", Major Thakur Dalpat Singh, and later visited the Indian WW1 cemetery of Indian soldiers who died during World War I in the region.
The coastal city of Haifa was liberated by Indian soldiers during WWI from the Ottomans in what most war historians consider ""the last great cavalry campaign in history"".
Dalpat Singh, popularly known as the Hero of Haifa, died in the battle leading the Jodhpur Lancers who launched the daring cavalry action.
Indian cavalry regiments armed with spears and swords had displayed the highest tradition of valour and cleared the Ottoman forces from the rocky slopes of Mt. Carmel under all odds on September 23, 1918.
""Haifa is pleased to open its doors to the Indian film industry and sees the visit of the delegation members as a great opportunity to promote Haifa as a destination for International filming and to strengthen the cultural ties and friendship between Haifa and India,"" Yahav said.
The producers also toured southern Israel, including seeing the sites of the massacre at the Nova Peace Music Festival where over 400 young Israelis were murdered in a brutal attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and other affected communities in the attack such as Sderot, Ofakim, and nearby kibbutzim.

Allu Arjun's Pushpa 2 hits cinemas! His 7 iconic films every fan must see,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/allu-arjuns-pushpa-2-hits-cinemas-his-7-iconic-films-every-fan-must-see/slideshow/115994853.cms,05-12-2024,,entertainment
"Jio, Airtel at loggerheads again over licence fee for DTH operators",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jio-airtel-at-loggerheads-again-over-licence-fee-for-dth-operators/articleshow/115983343.cms,05-12-2024,"Mumbai - Telecom operators
Reliance Jio Infocomm
and
Bharti Airtel
are once again at odds over waiving the licence fee for direct-to-home (DTH) operators, with the former advocating for retaining the fee and the latter calling for its eventual phase-out.
Both companies presented their views to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) during its consultation on the 'Framework for Service Authorisations for the Provision of Broadcasting Services under the Telecommunications Act, 2023'.
Airtel has called for the complete removal of the licence fee, arguing for parity between DTH and other TV distribution platforms, which are exempt from such charges.
Tata Play has also urged the TRAI to implement the recommendations at the earliest and also remove the cross-media restrictions, which prevent broadcasters from owning more than 20% in a distribution company.
Airtel also stated that the licence fee currently levied on content revenue and paid by DTH operators should instead be borne by broadcasters, who ultimately benefit from such revenue.
Live Events
Additionally, Airtel suggested that the definitions of Gross Revenue (GR), Applicable Gross Revenue (ApGR), and Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR), as prescribed by the Cabinet for the telecom sector, should also apply to DTH licencees.
In contrast, Jio has opposed the waiver, asserting that DTH services benefit from
free spectrum allocation
, which is valued significantly below market rates. This, Jio argued, causes revenue losses to the national exchequer and provides DTH operators with an unfair advantage over cable TV and internet protocol television (IPTV) providers.
The Reliance Industries-owned operator also contended that waiving the licence fee based solely on comparisons with other platforms—without considering the unique benefits DTH gains from free spectrum—violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. This article, Jio noted, does not require identical treatment for all individuals with relevant distinctions.
Jio further emphasised that DTH operators, which rely on free spectrum and avoid investments in terrestrial fibre or8 cable networks, should not be considered for fee waivers while fixed-line and mobile service providers, who invest heavily in infrastructure and spectrum, continue to pay licence fees.
In August 2023, TRAI recommended to the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) that the DTH licence fee be reduced to 3% of AGR from the current 8%, with a plan to phase it out entirely by FY27. This recommendation aimed to bring parity between DTH and other TV distribution platforms such as cable TV, HITS, and IPTV.
Jio also urged TRAI to independently analyse the issue of competitive advantages granted to DTH operators over fixed-line, cable TV, and mobile services due to the free spectrum allocation without relying solely on previous recommendations.
Airtel owns the DTH operator Bharti Telemedia, which operates under the
Airtel Digital TV
brand, while Jio runs cable networks such as
DEN Networks
and Hathway Cable & Datacom, and holds a significant stake in
GTPL Hathway
.
TRAI's consultation is part of its effort to provide recommendations to MIB on formulating an authorisation framework for broadcasting services under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, which replaced the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. This framework seeks to streamline broadcasting regulations, including DTH, IPTV, and radio broadcasting, under a unified telecommunications framework.
In the past, the MIB has sought dues from DTH operators based on 10% of their gross revenue without deductions. However, DTH operators have made various deductions under different income categories, calculating a ""Licence Fee Payable GR"" and paying 10% of that figure.
The four private DTH operators face potential licence fee liabilities exceeding Rs 15,000 crore. They have challenged the MIB's demand notices, disputing the computation of the licence fee and the constitutional validity of the old DTH guidelines that were replaced with new operational guidelines in 2022. The matter is currently pending in the Supreme Court.

"Pushpa 2: Allu Arjun starrer to be a game-changer with likely ₹1,000 crore box office prediction",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pushpa-2-the-rule-allu-arjun-rashmika-mandana-starrer-to-be-a-game-changer-with-likely-1000-crore-box-office-prediction-story-pushpa-2-tickets-baahubali-record/articleshow/115934861.cms,04-12-2024,"Pushpa 2: The Rule, the highly anticipated sequel to the 2021 blockbuster, may create history at the box office and its lifetime global gross collection is estimated at a staggering ₹1,000 crore in India alone. Elara Securities said not only
Pushpa 2
has the potential to break records, but it is also poised to boost Hindi gross box office collections (GBOC) and provide a significant lift to multiplex operators such as PVR INOX.
According to Elara Securities, Pushpa 2 is well on its way to setting new records. It cited a frenzy among fans in core Hindi-speaking regions like Bihar during the trailer launch of Pushpa 2 and exceptional advance bookings, which reached ₹50 crore on Day 1 alone, as key indicators for what is to come for Pushpa 2 as a revenue generator. By comparison, Baahubali had ₹45 crore in Day 1 bookings, Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan ₹23 crore, and Jawan ₹17 crore.
Pushpa 2 already creating records
Pushpa 2: The Rule has been one of the most eagerly awaited films since its announcement, generating immense excitement among fans. Social media platforms are abuzz with updates and discussions as anticipation for the release continues to build. Recognising the overwhelming hype, the Andhra Pradesh government has approved a ticket price hike for Allu Arjun and Rashmika Mandana’s upcoming blockbuster, a gesture that has left the actor feeling deeply grateful.
Bookmyshow recently posted an update on X, showcasing a poster that read, ""1 million+ tickets booked in advance."" The advance booking numbers for Pushpa 2 clearly indicate that the film's fever is ""unstoppable.""
The buzz surrounding Pushpa 2: The Rule isn’t limited to India—it’s making waves internationally as well. In Oceania, the film has already achieved an impressive $700K in pre-sales, setting a record for the highest-ever opening for an Indian movie in the region.
Live Events
In India, the film has surpassed 2.6 million interests on Paytm, marking the highest ever for an Indian movie. Meanwhile, North America is projected to deliver a $3+ million opening, positioning the film among the biggest Indian releases in the region, according to a report by Sacnik.
Pushpa 2 box office colection predictions
The first installment of the Pushpa franchise grossed ₹400 crore in India. With the franchise’s strong recall, Pushpa 2 has the potential to shatter records with a projected global collection of 20% more than ₹1,000 crore expected collection in India, said Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara Securities. Pushpa 2 is expected to garner ₹500 crore from Hindi collections and overall India collection has the potential to surpass the records of Baahubali 2 (₹1,200 crore) and KGF: Chapter 2 (₹1,000 crore).
The Day 1 GBOC of Pushpa 2 is anticipated to touch ₹200 crore, with contributions of ₹100 crore from Andhra Pradesh and ₹80 crore from Hindi-speaking states. Other southern states are expected to contribute ₹15–20 crore. The first weekend collections could reach ₹500 crore, pushing December theatre occupancy above 40%, fueled by higher footfalls.

Struggling movie production houses may open their doors to buyers
Pushpa 2 a big help for Hindi box office
“Hindi gross box office collection (GBOC) is likely to grow 33% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in Q3FY25 to ₹1,700 crore, backed by strong performances from Singham Again and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3, and the potential ₹500 crore grossing of Pushpa 2 (Hindi) alone,” said Karan Taurani.
Theatre occupancy in Q3FY25 is expected to average 30%, with Pushpa 2 alone driving a 40% occupancy rate in December, he added.
A robust content pipeline and a strong lineup for CY25 bode well for leading movie exhibitors.
Elara Securities’ analysis highlights a recovery in footfalls during the Diwali season, with occupancy improving to 25–27% in November, up from less than 20% in October. Despite this, average ticket prices (ATP) have remained flat due to the absence of Hollywood releases and promotional offers.
Recent Diwali releases performed well: Singham Again got ₹290 crore and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 earned ₹310 crore, Elara noted. Other releases, including Devara Part 2 and The Sabarmati Report, added a combined ₹100 crore.
December promises a blockbuster month with major releases like Pushpa 2, Baby John, and Sitaare Jameen Par. Overall, Q3FY25 occupancy is expected to hit 29–30%, driving Hindi GBOC growth to ₹1,700 crore, up 33% QoQ.
Pushpa 2 likely success will be a boost for PVR INOX
The anticipated success of Pushpa 2 comes
as a significant tailwind for multiplex operators like PVR INOX, whose overall GBOC (Hindi + non-Hindi) is expected to grow 29% QoQ in Q3FY25 to ₹800 crore.
Shares of PVR Inox Ltd climbed by nearly 1.5% today after global brokerage UBS reaffirmed its 'buy' rating on the movie exhibitor. UBS also raised its price target for PVR stock to Rs 2,000 per share, up from the previous target of Rs 1,950.
PVR INOX holds a 33% share of India’s Hindi GBOC and is projected to gross ₹560 crore from Hindi films in Q3FY25, representing 38% QoQ growth. Its non-Hindi GBOC is expected to grow 10–15%, supported by releases like Mufasa: The Lion King and Venom: The Last Dance, as well as regional hits like Pushpa 2 and Devara Part 2.

After Pushpa 2, there's robust pipeline for 2025
Looking ahead, CY25 is shaping up to be a blockbuster year for cinemas. Major Hollywood releases such as Captain America: Brave New World, Jurassic World, and Mickey 17 are expected to draw audiences, alongside domestic hits like Toxic and Rajasaab, and sequels of popular Hindi films.
PVR INOX is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum, with occupancy gains potentially boosting ATP and SPH. Advertising revenues are also expected to improve with the release of high-profile content.

Struggling movie production houses may open their doors to buyers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/struggling-movie-production-houses-may-open-their-doors-to-buyers/articleshow/115909965.cms,03-12-2024,"A consolidation wave is likely to build steadily among
film production houses
in the coming months as their costs in running operations mount and interest of large and mid-sized corporations in the entertainment business increases.
Producers, independent consultants and trade analysts who spoke with ET shared that in the coming months large and medium-sized companies may acquire either a big or a bunch of mid-and-small-sized film production houses as their vision is not restricted to merely film business.
Ram Mirchandani, founder, Rampage Motion Pictures, a production house, said, ""The Dharma Productions-Adar Poonawala deal has paved the way for some consolidation in the industry. We foresee either big companies acquiring well-established production houses or medium-sized companies acquiring a bunch of small boutique production houses.""
A common challenge which most production houses face today is the cost and time involved from developing film projects to obtaining the right material. Considerable amount of money and time is invested from the development stage of a film to finding the right material. Developing scripts, bibles, buying re-make or other rights and then high fixed expenses in running a production house are unavoidable costs. Many a time, these costs are not recovered as projects get shelved for a variety of reasons.
Live Events
""So, there is a need to fund costs. If you have investments, you can produce a film and leverage better on satellite and digital rights,"" said Ram Mirchandani of Rampage Motion Pictures. Changing dynamics of cost of film-making and performance of films at the box office have been another bane for production houses as they are unable to recover their investments.
Girish Wankhede, a movie trade analyst, said, ""Production houses have been working on thin margins. Earlier, a hit film would recover the losses of four flop films. Today, a flop film wipes out the gains from four hit films. This shows production houses are not making enough money on their investments.""
These are the reasons why production houses need money and could serve as lucrative investments for corporations. Post the Dharma Productions-Adar Poonawalla deal, there are reports which suggest that production houses Excel Entertainment (co-founded by actor Farhan Akhtar) and Abundantia Entertainment are also looking to raise money through selling stake.
Independent consultants are of the view that the interest of corporations in acquiring production houses serves their goals beyond the film business.
Shrirang Nargund, a veteran and independent consultant on entertainment business, said, ""I think corporations have a bigger vision than merely investing in film business. They may want to exploit the creative talent of production houses in launching various business verticals such as gaming, web series, interactive social media content, and leveraging influencers on social media by providing them required infrastructure.""
The lure of acquiring intellectual property (IP) of existing and future films is another reason corporations are showing interest in the business.
Vishesh Agrawal, a film producer, associated with films such as Dangal (2016) and Dream Girl 2 (2023) said, ""Corporations do their due diligence. They will buy only those production houses which have strong IPs in their film libraries and a long proven performance across business cycles of the industry."" ""It is not the first time corporations are showing interest in production houses. Earlier production houses managed without them. But today production houses need money because revenues are shrinking,"" he added.
On a macro level, producers believe that large corporations may want to leverage on the increasing emergence of
Indian Cinema
content as a 'soft power' in global markets. Producer and film business expert Girish Johar said, ""Today, cinema is soft power. Indian content is consumed globally through streaming platforms. This provides a convincing reason for corporations to invest in the sector as it allows them to market and position a type of content.""

ZEE AGM: Shareholders block Punit Goenka's reappointment as Zee Director,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-share-price-shareholders-block-punit-goenkas-reappointment-as-zee-director/articleshow/115788145.cms,29-11-2024,"Punit Goenka
, the CEO of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
Ltd (ZEEL), has encountered a setback after shareholders blocked his reappointment as a director during the company's annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday. According to voting results, 50.45% of shareholders opposed the resolution.
This development follows Goenka's recent resignation as managing director and withdrawal of consent for reappointment, initially slated for the AGM on November 28. Despite these changes, Goenka remains the CEO, a position he will hold for a five-year term until 2029.
In another key decision, the Zee board approved the appointment of
Saurav Adhikari
as additional director in the capacity of non-executive director, effective November 29. This appointment, recommended by the Nomination & Remuneration Committee, is subject to member approval.
On November 18, Goenka informed the board of his decision to step down as MD to focus on operational responsibilities as CEO. Proxy advisory firms, including Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) and InGovern Research Services, had advised shareholders to vote against Goenka's reappointment as director and MD.
During the AGM, Goenka shared his vision for ZEEL's future, focusing on improving short-term performance while ensuring long-term sustainability. He reaffirmed the company's dual objectives of generating attractive returns for shareholders and sustaining profitability with healthy margins. He attributed ZEEL's operational strategy to three pillars: frugality, optimisation and quality content.
Live Events
Acknowledging challenges such as a subdued advertising environment, Goenka highlighted declining ad spend in sectors like FMCG, gaming and direct-to-consumer brands. However, he noted that the introduction of
New Tariff Order
(NTO) 3.0, enabling inflation-linked subscription price adjustments, had mitigated some revenue pressures.
Despite these headwinds, ZEEL's growing viewership in key markets has strengthened its position as India's second-largest entertainment network. Goenka expressed confidence in ZEEL's ability to adapt to a dynamic competitive landscape and achieve robust growth in the future.
ZEEL has been facing challenges ever since its planned merger deal with
Sony Pictures Networks
India collapsed forcing the company to streamline operations and control costs.
To achieve its target of 18-20% EBITDA margin, the company implemented a 15% reduction in its workforce, affecting approximately 700 of its 4,500 employees across various functions. It had laid off 50% of the staff at its Technology & Innovation Centre in Bengaluru.
""As expected, the reappointment of Punit Goenka failed to secure the requisite votes, as shareholders are angry that, under his leadership, the company was unable to consummate the merger with Sony. The board should introspect about the company's future and its leadership,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services.

Zee Entertainment
have rejected a proposal for the reappointment of Punit
Goenka
as director, according to a regulatory filing by the company. The filing by
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL) stated that the resolution for the reappointment of Goenka was defeated in the annual general meeting (AGM) of the company.
Resolution number three in the AGM, which proposed the reappointment of Goenka as director, was supported by only 49.54 per cent of the total number of votes cast while 50.4 per cent voted against the resolution.
""Resolution No. 3 (Goenka's reappointment) failed to get the requisite majority of votes as required under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,"" ZEEL said.
This is a major setback for Goenka who is currently the CEO of the company. Several proxy firms had earlier advised the shareholders to vote against resolution number three.
However, the three other resolutions for adopting the financial statement for FY'24, declaring a dividend, and ratification of remuneration to cost auditors were passed.
Live Events
""Except for resolution number three, all the aforesaid resolutions were passed with requisite majority,"" it said.
The Companies Act, 2013, mandates a simple majority of (50 per cent plus one) votes to pass an ordinary resolution at an annual general meeting.
Earlier this month Punit Goenka, had resigned from the post of managing director of ZEEL. However, he continued as CEO of the media and entertainment major. He had also withdrawn himself from reappointment for the said post in the AGM.
While sharing Goenka's resignation letter to exchanges last week, Zee Entertainment said he is ""withdrawing his consent for his re-appointment as managing director of the company as proposed in the notice of the ensuing annual general meeting"".
On October 18, the board of ZEEL approved the proposal for Goenka's reappointment for a five-year term, effective from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2029.

December releases may do the trick for Hindi film industry,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/december-releases-may-do-the-trick-for-hindi-film-industry/articleshow/115758319.cms,28-11-2024,"The Hindi film trade is betting on three highly anticipated releases to end 2024 with a big bang after what’s been a lacklustre year. Tellingly, only one of these is a bonafide
Bollywood
movie--Baby John, starring Varun Dhawan. The other two are Hindi dubs--Allu Arjun’s
Pushpa 2: The Rule
(a Telugu original) and Disney’s
Mufasa: The Lion King
, with the titular character voiced by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan.
With the trade talking up their chances, analysts estimate these three movies have the potential to collect close to Rs1,500 crore at the box office, with Pushpa 2 accounting for as much as two-thirds of this. The film will be released on December 5, Mufasa on December 20 and
Baby John
on December 25.
“Pushpa 2 is the most anticipated film of the year,” said Gautam Dutta, CEO, revenue and operations,
PVR INOX
. “With its massive fan base eagerly waiting, the film is projected to be the highest grosser of the year. We are expecting house-full shows in cinemas across India.”
One of reasons for the optimism about December being a bumper movie month is the diversity of genres on offer. “December has always been huge for the
Hindi film industry
but this year is an exception,” said Girish Wankhede, an independent movie trade analyst. “Audiences have access to a diverse palette of genres: masala entertainer (Pushpa 2), action (Baby John) and a great franchise which has a strong recall or nostalgic value (Mufasa).
Besides this, these films are being promoted sufficiently well.” What will also work in favour of Pushpa 2 is the eagerness to discover what happens to the characters and plot threads introduced in the first instalment, Pushpa: The Rise (2021). The sequel could drum up Rs1,000 crore business on the opening weekend itself, according to trade estimates, given the fan frenzy over the Hindi version, the trailer of which has got higher views than the original in Telugu.
Live Events
According to YouTube data, the Hindi trailer has got 72 million views, ahead of the Telugu version’s 62 million. A publicity event at Gandhi Maidan in Patna in Bihar attracted close to 200,000 people, indicating how deeply the film has penetrated the Hindi hinterland.
“There is tremendous craze around Pushpa 2,” said film distributor and trade analyst Shaaminder Malik. “The film makers have left no stone unturned in marketing and promoting the film. This has added to the curiosity.”He also pegs collections at Rs1,000 crore given the pan-India following.
Baby John, which presents actor Varun Dhawan in a mass action entertainer for the first time, could drum up business of Rs100-200 crore at the box office, Malik said.
The festive Christmas mood may prove advantageous for Baby John as well as the Disney release, with audiences equally excited about the Mufasa, especially with SRK’s voice.
""The origin story of Mufasa and Taka has generated huge interest among parents to showcase it to their children. We have received requests for group bookings from parents,” said Rahul Dhyani, founder of Connplex Cinemas, a miniplex (75-seat theatre) chain with halls in Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Many of these parents would have watched the original, animated movie The Lion King, back when it was released in 1994, its massive success spawning various spinoffs over the years. The film itself was remade in photorealistic animation in 2019.
“The film has a certain degree of familiarity among younger audiences,” Dhyani said. “Besides this, the franchise has a fairly loyal following among audiences who love animated movies. The voiceover of the film's Hindi version is done by actor Shah Rukh Khan, adding further excitement.” Mufasa could collect Rs100-200 crore all over India, he said. On the whole, he said these three films could collect close to Rs1,500 crore in December itself.
Apart from Hindi, Mufasa will also be dubbed in Tamil and Telugu, also by superstars--Arjun Das and Mahesh Babu, respectively.
Historically, December has been a key month for box office collections. The month has, in the past few years, seen big local and Hollywood releases such as Animal (2023), Godzilla Minus One (2023), Avatar: The Way of Water (2022), Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and Dabangg 3 (2019), all among the top 10 grossers in their years.

While the merger itself doesn’t directly alter the consumer’s experience, it lays the foundation for us to innovate and experiment in ways that could transform the industry.
With our combined reach of 750 million people and significant presence across critical content pools, we have the scale to lead impactful change. In my experience, when the industry leader takes bold steps that resonate with consumers, others tend to follow. This is especially important in a media landscape that’s undergoing rapid transformation globally and here in India, driven by technology and evolving consumer behaviours.
Television, in particular, remains a dominant force in India, and I believe reports of its decline are premature. Yes, every medium has its lifecycle, but television in this market still has a long way to go. The merger gives us the ability to explore new ideas and create offerings that strengthen the connection between content and audiences while adapting to the broader changes shaping the media and entertainment landscape.

If you have 90 million homes paying for TV every month and 125–135 million families watching TV daily, it’s clear that television is far from dead. There’s a significant opportunity to reinvent, revitalise, and make TV stronger and healthier.
On the other side, the streaming business offers immense growth potential. With 700-750 million people using mobile phones and consuming data in some form, we have a huge opportunity to connect with each one of them, given the compelling nature of our content. But achieving this isn’t just about providing content—it’s about transforming the entire consumer experience.
India is evolving rapidly, and with that comes the need for innovation across the content ecosystem. From how we create and offer content to how we monetise and produce it—everything needs to adapt. This merger gives us the scale to experiment, innovate, and execute these changes on a much larger level. It’s about reimagining what the future of entertainment can be, both in traditional and digital spaces.
And how do you intend to go about doing this?
By fundamentally changing the way content creation works, though it’s not something that can happen overnight. We already have a lot of content that’s performing well, and we’re running a successful business. It’s essential not to disrupt that core too much or too quickly.
This process has to be calibrated. We’ll start by experimenting selectively, seeing what works, and scaling up successful initiatives. As new ideas and content take shape, some of the older approaches will naturally phase out.
It’s a dynamic process, and while I can’t say we have a fully defined plan at this stage, we are firmly committed to this strategic direction and evolving with the changing needs of the audience.
The merged entity includes a profitable entertainment segment but also loss-making digital and sports businesses. Will these losses impact the overall financial health of the new entity?
Historically, when Star made significant bets, such as investing heavily in IP, there were similar concerns. Many believed Star was taking an enormous risk, but those investments worked out brilliantly. Star built a high-quality, integrated sports franchise and monetised the IPL, which turned out to be a game-changer. On the back of the IPL, Star was able to create Hotstar, which would have been impossible otherwise. Additionally, Star leveraged its integrated sports and entertainment content to secure a disproportionately large share of distribution revenues.
In our case, while some expensive rights exist, they are typically short-term—3 to 5 years at most. This has both drawbacks and advantages. The short tenure allows us to assess and recalibrate quickly.
The entertainment segment is robust and financially strong. Our streaming business, while at scale, continues to operate at a loss as part of the ongoing investment phase. However, these investments are essential to building a future-proof ecosystem. With the right strategies and synergies, we’re confident in managing these dynamics to strengthen the overall financial health of the new entity.
But even the streaming business is operating at a loss?
Right now, yes, it’s still in the investment phase, but that’s intentional. Take sports rights, for example—JioCinema wasn’t profitable initially, but that was a conscious choice. We were building a platform that didn’t exist before, and no business starts making money from day one. First, you build the product, create the market, bring it to customers, and then you start monetising.
With JioCinema, we knew that putting IPL on the platform wouldn’t make money immediately—it was about investing in growth and building the foundation. Now, the platform has matured, and we’ve established a solid customer base on both the ad and consumer sides. This allows us to start recasting our strategy and become more disciplined.
For instance, with the recent Asia Cup rights, we chose not to bid because it didn’t align with our strategic priorities. While we are willing to invest heavily in assets that are strategically important, we’re disciplined about evaluating their long-term value. Back in 2017, when we invested in IPL at Star, many thought it was expensive. But without that investment, we wouldn’t have been able to build a world-class TV sports franchise and Hotstar.
Looking ahead, we’ll continue to evaluate expensive rights. We’ve carried the burden for some time, and as the renewal periods approach, we’ll decide whether it makes sense to continue or to pivot. It’s all about being strategic and disciplined.
When you say some of the rights are expensive, are you referring to those that came with the merger?
That’s all history now. Everything is part of us, and we were fully aware of the rights we were inheriting when we made the deal. So there’s no point in revisiting that. That said, the cumulative value of the rights is significant—no question about it being onerous. However, we’re optimistic that we’ll be able to create incremental value from these assets to justify the investment.
What is the board’s mandate to you in terms of profitability, users, and scale?
To clarify, I’m not directly running the company. We have a team of executives, including three CEOs (Kevin Vaz, Kiran Mani, and Sanjog Gupta), who are responsible for the day-to-day operations. My role is more about shaping the strategy and guiding the leadership team. I’m part of the team that establishes the mandate, but execution lies with the operational leaders.
I’ve made an investment from my fund in this business, and there are other shareholders, with Reliance being the controlling shareholder. Naturally, there’s a clear expectation that this business will deliver very attractive financial returns—that’s the foundation on which I’ve raised money from my investors. Reliance, as a highly business-focused company, has similar expectations. It’s a given that we need to generate strong returns on investment and capital.
However, beyond financial returns, I have a very clear mandate from Reliance and other stakeholders: to redefine the media and entertainment ecosystem and prepare it for the future. While the media already has massive reach, I believe there’s a far greater opportunity to deliver content people love, whenever they want it, to the entire population of the country.
Previously, distribution was the biggest barrier, but that challenge has largely been addressed with the proliferation of mobile and broadband, a revolution that Reliance itself has been instrumental in driving. This transformation creates an incredible opportunity to reimagine how content reaches and engages audiences at scale.
I believe there’s a significant opportunity to drive deeper penetration and better consumption of content. To achieve that, we need to completely rethink how we approach content creation and delivery. This is what I referred to earlier—we must redefine many aspects of the process.
One key issue is the current concentration of content production and supply, particularly Hindi-language content, which remains heavily centralised in Mumbai. This model has its limitations. Gone are the days when a single production ecosystem could cater to the entire population north of the Vindhyas.
India is changing rapidly, with people’s tastes, aspirations, and expectations undergoing a dramatic transformation. To keep up with these shifts, we need to diversify and decentralise how and where content is created. That’s just one example of the kind of changes we’ll need to make to meet these evolving demands effectively.
You’ve said that the obituary of television has been written prematurely. Do you believe that the TV business still has a lot of potential in India?
Let me explain why I say that. In the US, television became very expensive, with consumers paying $60, $70, or even $80 as the minimum monthly cost. Streaming emerged as a cheaper and more convenient alternative—you paid $10 for a streaming service and got access to a wide library of content. While it wasn’t fresh content, it didn’t matter because most consumers hadn’t seen it yet, and they enjoyed the convenience of watching on their own schedule. Streaming addressed both affordability and convenience in that market.
In India, however, the dynamics are entirely different. Television is already extremely affordable, while streaming services aren’t as inexpensive. The Western narrative that TV is dying because consumers are shifting to streaming to save money simply doesn’t apply here.
In fact, the global streaming landscape is evolving too. With so many streaming services now available, consumers in markets like the U.S. are spending more collectively on subscriptions than they did on cable or TV. This just reinforces the point that television’s role, especially in India, remains strong and far from obsolete.
But isn’t it the case that once people cut the cord, they’re unlikely to return to traditional TV?
Once people get used to streaming, no, they’re not coming back. However, the number of streaming services in existence today is overwhelming, and many are struggling—except for one or two that are doing well. Affordability and quality of product remain a major factor. My point is that for any platform to succeed, the product must be both attractive and affordable.
In India, television’s biggest strength is its affordability. It delivers content that, while it might not appeal as much to certain segments of the urban elite, connects deeply with a vast population across the country. That connection gives television enduring power, and I believe it will remain relevant if reinforced with more innovation.
There’s a strong case for greater creative innovation on both sides—television and digital. Right now, both seem to be following predictable templates, and that’s where the opportunity lies: breaking out of the mould and offering something fresh and engaging.
Additionally, pay TV subscriptions have seen a significant decline over the past few years. What’s your perspective on this trend?
There are two or three key points here. First, the decline in pay TV numbers isn’t the full story. What really matters is the overall television universe, including free TV (DD Free Dish), and that hasn’t come down. In a value-conscious market like India, if consumers don’t see enough value in pay TV but find reasonable value in free TV, they’ll naturally migrate to free TV.
What exacerbated this trend is that many pay TV providers began offering their content on free TV platforms (DD Free Dish). Once that happened, why would a consumer pay for something they could watch for free?
However, live sports remains a stronghold for pay TV. It continues to perform exceptionally well because live sports are a unique draw—they’re best experienced in real time, and the TV viewing experience for live sports is unparalleled. While some mandatory sharing of live sports happens on platforms like Doordarshan, the core TV experience for live sports remains a major pull for audiences.
And I believe Star Sports has set the benchmark for creating a robust ecosystem that delivers an exceptional viewing experience. People aren’t walking away from that—it’s all about maintaining a compelling value proposition. Let me give you some background to illustrate this point.
Back in 2007, when I took over Star, there was a similar narrative—television was said to be in decline, people weren’t paying, ratings were dropping, and so on. Around the same time, Colors entered the market, shaking things up and sparking intense competition. The battle between Star Plus and Colors played out over several years, but it also led to a significant surge in the reach of Hindi entertainment. Suddenly, audiences were seeing fresh, engaging content, and they were excited again.
Another example is when we experimented with Satyamev Jayate. It brought in entirely new audiences and reinvigorated interest. Media thrives on innovation and creative disruption. It’s not just about maintaining the status quo—it’s about constantly finding ways to excite and engage audiences with something fresh and meaningful. That’s the essence of this industry.
The key difference between then and now is that, back then, we only had television screens, whereas today, the widespread adoption of smartphones has introduced multiple screens into our lives.
It doesn't make any difference to me as a media company since we are providing content across screens. If your universe of monetisation expands, unit values don't matter. We have created an artificial divide between TV and digital. Viewers don't see that way. They go to the screens that are easily available to them and the experience that they want. For a laid-back, relaxed experience, they will go to broadcast TV or connected TV. They will watch it on mobile if they want to watch content on the go during the weekday. We just want to be ubiquitous on all screens and create great experiences for consumers.
Many traditional media companies, including Viacom18 and Star, have been heavily investing in digital platforms, often at the expense of television. As a result, investments in TV have significantly decreased, with funds shifting towards digital. Given your optimistic outlook on television, will you be increasing your investments in this area?
I can’t speak for what others are doing—those decisions are made by their leadership teams. But we’re very clear that we’re not cutting down investments in one area to favour the other. We see significant growth potential in both digital and TV.
Of course, digital is growing at an incredible rate, so naturally, we’ll need to allocate more resources to fully capitalise on that massive universe, which is set to become a billion screens. However, that doesn’t mean we’ll reduce investments in TV. In fact, given the strength of the franchises and brands (Star and Colors) we have on the TV side, we intend to invest even more in television.
It’s a different scenario now compared to when we were at Viacom18, which had a smaller television business. Back then, we had to prioritise, and it wasn’t feasible to grow a small TV business while simultaneously building a large digital platform. Now, with a strong presence at scale in both TV and digital, there’s no reason not to continue building on both fronts.
Even today, nearly $10 billion (Rs 83,000 crore) of revenue comes from traditional TV business. Why would we step back from such a significant space? Instead, we’ll double down on investments to ensure both platforms thrive.
Do you consider big tech companies to be a significant threat to traditional media companies?
I wouldn’t call them a threat, but they are certainly formidable players with immense resources. They’ve built scale at a global level and have access to vast amounts of data, which gives them a significant advantage in terms of targeting.
However, I don’t see them as direct competition. The market is large enough, and the growth opportunities are substantial enough for multiple operators to thrive and grow. Big tech will continue doing what it does, but that doesn’t mean traditional media companies can’t succeed and scale alongside them.
The key lies in ensuring we build the right safeguards to protect consumer interests while leveraging our strengths to grow. While big tech excels in technology, traditional media has its own unique value propositions, and there’s plenty of room for both to coexist and flourish.
Media companies don’t necessarily need to replicate the data-driven ad stack that big tech companies excel at. Trying to compete on their turf, where you’re already at a disadvantage, doesn’t make sense.
In my view, media companies should focus on what they’re inherently good at—creating compelling content and building strong consumer connections. It’s about running your own race, staying confident in your strengths, and recognising that every runner has a different style. The key is to leverage what makes you unique rather than chasing a game designed for someone else’s strengths.
What time frame are you considering for integrating the two organisations?
There’s no fixed rule for how long integration should take, although these processes can often drag on. From the very beginning, it was clear that I didn’t want the organisation to be paralysed by volatility, uncertainty, or a lack of clarity.
We announced the merger last week and have already moved quickly. In fact, one of the unique aspects of this merger is that we announced the entire senior-level leadership team on the very day of the merger.
I’m fully committed to finalising all aspects of the integration in the next few weeks and then focusing on creating value in the business. Whatever it takes, we’ll make it happen. From my experience handling other mergers, I know the uncertainty these processes can create, and that uncertainty can be damaging to the organisation, especially to smaller teams. We’re determined to avoid that and move forward decisively. We have brought in EY to help with the integration.
Given the potential duplication of roles, will there be layoffs during the integration process?
Wherever there’s more than one person for the same role, we’ll first look to find them another meaningful position within the organization. However, in some cases, there may be redundancies. We’re committed to managing this process thoughtfully and transparently. You know both sides are very familiar with each other. It's a small ecosystem.
Given the likely overlaps of channels during the integration process, how do you plan to address this issue?
Yes, there may be some overlaps, but our primary focus is ensuring that corporate actions don’t disrupt the consumer experience. A viewer of Star Plus is a committed viewer of Star Plus, and the same goes for Colors. Just as we aim to minimise internal confusion, we are equally committed to avoiding any confusion for external stakeholders, whether they are advertisers, consumers, or producers.
Each company has its own relationships, and we don’t want to disrupt those in the name of efficiency. The goal isn’t to force changes unless they genuinely enhance the experience or add value. Simply put, we won’t make changes just for the sake of it.
For now, all these brands will continue as they are. Of course, there are certain obligations imposed on us by the Competition Commission of India that we’ll need to adhere to, but beyond that, there are no immediate plans to make significant changes.
Have you decided whether to keep both streaming apps separately, or will you combine them to create a super app?
That’s exactly the kind of discussion we’re having—exploring the merits of various approaches. There are strong arguments on both sides, whether to differentiate the platforms by content type or take another route. Personally, I’ve spent more time debating this specific aspect of the integration than almost any other topic. It’s a critical decision that requires careful consideration.
Do you expect a shake-up in the broadcast industry due to the size and scale of JioStar?
On the TV side, I don’t see much of a shake-up. Essentially, what’s happened is that four companies have consolidated into three. While there’s a change in ownership and some consolidation, it’s not the kind of shakeup it’s being portrayed as. For advertisers, consumers, and producers, the impact will likely feel minimal.
What I do believe, however, is that this consolidation presents an opportunity to create incremental value. We’ll experiment, and in my experience, when the leader experiments successfully, it often sets a new norm for the market. This has the potential to benefit the entire industry.
In fact, I’ve seen this happen before—moments like these often invigorate the industry, infusing it with fresh energy and creativity. I hope this merger will lead to something similar, bringing renewed momentum to the broadcast space.
Considering the merger of two major players and Sony's cautious bidding approach, do you anticipate a correction in sports rights costs during the next cycle?
We chose not to bid for the Asia Cup this time because the base price was set at a level we didn’t find viable. As you mentioned, we already have a substantial sports portfolio with serious financial commitments, so we decided to sit this one out.
I believe the cricketing world needs to address a critical issue: the current model, where buyers rarely make money while rights holders continue to profit, is simply unsustainable. Disproportionate value in cricket comes from one market—India—and within that market, it’s heavily reliant on the media sector.
For the long-term health of the ecosystem, rights owners need to consider the interests of broadcasters. If they don’t, it’s a shortsighted approach that risks undermining the very market they depend on. Sustainable partnerships are key to ensuring the growth and success of the sport and its stakeholders.
Do you view losses as one of the primary challenges for JioStar over the next two to three years, particularly in relation to sports rights? This is especially relevant considering that, unlike Star, entertainment profits might not be sufficient to balance out the losses from sports.
First of all, I wouldn’t say that entertainment profits are capped or unable to grow. I believe there’s still substantial headroom for growth in TV entertainment, and even more so on the digital entertainment side. In sports, I see significant opportunities for incremental value creation within the business itself. The key is to unlock that potential effectively.
As for entertainment, if our content is compelling enough to consistently deliver 25–27% viewership on TV, there’s no reason it shouldn’t generate similar engagement on the digital side. The challenge is curating the digital experience better—leveraging advanced technology and deeper customer insights to enhance the way audiences interact with our content.
It’s not about compensating for losses but about realising untapped value across both entertainment and sports. With the right focus and strategy, I’m confident we can achieve sustainable growth in both areas.
Will JioStar go public some time in the future?
That decision rests entirely with the controlling shareholder. At this point, an IPO isn’t something we’re actively considering. Our focus is on building a strong, scalable business that could support a highly successful IPO, if and when the time comes. Whether there will be an IPO, I can’t say. As for myself, I will need an exit eventually, but there are several ways to achieve that beyond just an IPO.
How did the talks between Star and Viacom18 begin?
The conversation started between the principal stakeholders at Reliance and the senior leadership on the Disney side. I believe there was an understanding that if the two companies came together, it would address many of the emerging challenges in the media landscape.
You have to understand that, whether it’s television or digital, the biggest challenges aren’t coming from within the media industry itself—even in India. The real challenges, in terms of value and consumption, are coming from global tech media companies. There was a shared appreciation of this reality, and I think that’s what led to the belief that joining forces could help reset the landscape and create a stronger foundation for the future. That’s how the talks began.
How did you find yourself at this stage after leaving Star in 2020?
To be completely honest, these things don’t happen overnight—it’s a process, a series of conversations, and decisions along the way. When I was leaving Star and Disney after serving as Head of Asia Pacific for Disney, I thought my time in media was done.
For someone who never set out to be a CEO, even for a day, it wasn’t part of my ambition. I started as a journalist, and my only goal was to become a good editor, which I achieved. I was fortunate enough to create brands I was proud of and found fulfilment in that phase of my career.
What happened next was almost serendipitous. One thing led to another, and I was brought into Star, where I spent close to 15 years. It was an incredible journey, but when the time came, I had to ask myself: Do I continue doing this for a few more years, or do I take a leap and try something new?
It was clear that this wasn’t going to be the final chapter for me. It wasn’t an easy decision, but I felt ready to move on and explore what else was out there. And here I am, in a role and space I never could have fully envisioned back then.
And then there were areas of personal interest that I felt strongly about, given my background and experiences. I’ve always had a point of view on social issues, and earlier in my career, news was one way for me to engage with those. I also deeply believe in the power of media, both entertainment and news, as a socially transformative tool.
However, having already explored those avenues, I began to think about what else could make a meaningful impact. One area that always excited me was the power of technology to solve big social and consumer problems in India—especially in sectors where access and affordability have been longstanding challenges.
Two areas stood out in particular: education and healthcare. These are deeply personal to me because I’ve seen parts of India where access to both is severely limited and the impact that lack of access has on people’s lives. At the same time, I’ve witnessed the incredible transformative power of ensuring availability and affordability in these critical areas. That realisation has fuelled my interest in exploring how technology can be leveraged to bridge these gaps and create lasting change.
We are all fortunate to be sitting around this table because we had access to good education. That realisation led me to consider two possible paths to make a difference—one through a not-for-profit model and the other through a corporate structure.
Early in my career, I spent several years in the not-for-profit sector, so I’ve seen that world up close. I worked with organisations like Anand and was closely associated with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), where I served as Associate Director for many years. Those experiences shaped my understanding of how impactful not-for-profits can be, but they also highlighted the challenges of scaling their efforts.
That’s what made me curious about exploring a corporate approach to tackling some of these pressing issues, combining purpose with scale and sustainability.
I realised that while the intent behind not-for-profit work is always admirable, its impact is often constrained by scale. You’re limited by the resources you can secure and constantly dependent on external funding. For me, the challenge was how to tackle social issues in a way that allowed for meaningful, scalable impact. That’s when I decided to pursue these ambitions within a corporate structure—a social business model that could combine purpose with scale and sus",

Nikhil Kamath, Stride Ventures acquire minority stakes in media-tech firm Streambox Media
Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma acknowledged that while the product is designed for a wide audience, the concept of a subscription-based TV is new and requires significant consumer education. “Our biggest challenge is communicating the value of this service to users,” Sharma said. “The idea of bundling premium hardware, content, and software updates into one affordable package might feel ‘too good to be true.’”
Sharma also shared that Dor TV sets will be manufactured at Micromax's production facilities across four locations, ensuring a balance between affordability and quality. The revenue model for Dor involves an upfront payment for the TV followed by recurring monthly subscription charges. “This structure ensures recurring revenues, which investors favour. Advertising is another potential revenue stream, given we control the OS,” Sharma added. “Of course, this won’t compromise the user experience.”
Dor reimagines the traditional television ecosystem by prioritising flexibility and affordability. For Rs 799 per month, users gain access to premium content across platforms like Prime Video, Jio Cinema, Disney+ Hotstar, SonyLIV, and more. The conversations to onboard Netflix are also in progress.
The service also includes regional and niche platforms such as Aha, Hoichoi, and Sun NXT. After 12 months, customers can personalise their subscriptions based on their viewing preferences.
With its hardware-software integration, Dor is positioning itself as a disruptor in India’s rapidly growing connected TV market, which is expected to double from 50 million to 100 million households in the next five years.
According to Streambox Media founder and CEO Anuj Gandhi Gandhi, Dor's approach—combining hardware, software, and content—positions it to disrupt multiple segments. By challenging global smart TV brands, Dor intends to add value through integrated services, driving OTT subscriber growth and offering a comprehensive entertainment experience. Its landing page strategy can potentially turn the TV into a multifunctional hub for e-commerce, interactive content, and additional services beyond traditional viewing.
Gandhi highlighted that TV as a service is both the most exciting and challenging innovation, requiring time and effort to educate consumers and shift traditional viewing habits. He emphasised that achieving a double-digit market share within 2–3 years is crucial for disrupting the market, which will require scaling operations and ensuring smooth functionality.
Post-COVID, SVOD platforms have plateaued, with increasing churn rates and stagnating growth. Gandhi believes Dor's aim would be to drive growth in SVOD subscriptions by offering affordable pricing, universal content access, and the convenience of integrated hardware.
By embedding interactivity within TVs, users can also engage in activities such as gaming, quizzes, or interactive shows directly on the platform. This innovation enhances user engagement and introduces digital-first experiences to traditional television.
Gandhi envisions smart TVs becoming central to commerce, enabling activities like food ordering through platforms like
Swiggy
or Zomato. For instance, viewers could order food directly while watching a cricket match, facilitated by QR codes and in-app payment gateways.
He also drew parallels between TVs and smartphones, noting that the TV lifecycle is shortening, with replacements happening every 3–4 years.

Tamil film Maharaja to release in China on Friday; first Indian film to be screened after normalisation of ties,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tamil-film-maharaja-to-release-in-china-on-friday-first-indian-film-to-be-screened-after-normalisation-of-ties/articleshow/115689496.cms,26-11-2024,"Tamil suspense film Maharaja will be released in China on Friday becoming the first Indian cinema to be screened for Chinese audiences after the normalisation of ties between the two countries following last month's agreement to resolve the standoff in Eastern Ladakh. The suspense film Maharaja has already begun pre-screenings and its release here coincides with two major competitors - Hollywood's Gladiator II and local film Her Story.
State-run Global Times reported on Tuesday that the film currently holds a high rating of 8.7/10 on Chinese movie review site Douban and is regarded as one of the highest-rated Indian films in recent years.
Directed by Nithilan Swaminathan, the film stars actors Vijay Sethupathi, Anurag Kashyap, Mamta Mohandas and Natty Natraj. It hit the Indian screens on June 14 and was a huge hit.
Maharaja -- which is titled 'Yin Guo Bao Ying' in Chinese -- will be first Indian film to be screened in China after both the countries firmed up an agreement on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, in a major breakthrough to end the over four-year border standoff.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at their meeting in Kazan in Russia on the sidelines of the BRICS summit on October 23 endorsed the agreement and issued directions to revive various bilateral dialogue mechanisms and normalise ties that were hit by a deadly military clash in 2020 at Galwan Valley.
Live Events
Indian films specially Aamir Khan's Three Idiots, Dangal and Secret Superstar have become a major success in China in recent years as the themes largely resonated with the Chinese audiences and earned a significant amount of revenue.
Khan has become a household name in China.
China has about 86,000 theatres all over the country, the highest in the world.
Chinese film critics say Maharaja too is expected to do very well.
""The strength of Maharaja lies in its distinctive cultural expression and unique narrative techniques,"" Wang Peiyu, a Douban film critic, told the Global Times.
""As a suspense film, it uses editing techniques to cleverly conceal the key actions of the protagonist, interspersing numerous subplots to confuse the audience. Through cross-cutting, it creates a feeling of simultaneity and carefully constructs a labyrinthine narrative,"" he noted.
The film's release in China coincides with two major competitors - the upcoming Hollywood blockbuster Gladiator II and local film Her Story.
Wang said many Chinese moviegoers have expressed that the theme of Maharaja, which deliberately misguides the audience and revealing the truth suddenly near the end, leaving watchers stunned, can break through language and cultural barriers to resonate with Chinese audiences.
He pointed out that this subversive narrative approach not only gives the film a strong sense of sophistication but also makes it a stand out in its genre, positioning it as a true blockbuster.
A viewer surnamed Li, who has watched the pre-screening, said that the film continues the tradition of recent Indian cinema, which focuses on social issues, while also incorporating religious beliefs and moral concepts from Indian culture.
""For Chinese audiences, such films not only provide intellectual stimulation but also offer a chance to understand Indian culture from a different perspective,"" Li told the daily.
""In recent years, Indian films have established a strong presence in the Chinese market. From Dangal to Secret Superstar, these films have sparked discussions among audiences with their sincere emotions and social issues,"" she added.
Wang said Indian films have not only performed well at the box office but have also consistently won over Chinese audiences with their distinct themes and profound social issues.
""Films like Maharaja often have a strong moral core, which is closely related to traditional Indian values. This is one of the key differences when compared to the more secular or individualistic narrative styles found in many Western films,"" Wang said.
He pointed out that in contrast, many Western suspense films focus more on psychological elements, dealing with themes of betrayal and justice, and rarely delve into cultural backgrounds.
Compared to Hollywood blockbusters like Gladiator II, which attract attention with their global influence and epic production, films like Maharaja offer a different kind of appeal in the global market through their unique regional and philosophical elements, making them especially appealing to audiences seeking diverse cultures and profound themes, he said.

AI use comes of age in Hindi film production,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ai-use-comes-of-age-in-hindi-film-production/articleshow/115671234.cms,26-11-2024,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making its presence felt in the Hindi film industry as increasing use of such technology tools would help makers not only save time but also costs - both in the pre- and post-production stages of film-making.
ET spoke to producers, directors, writers, editors, and companies that provide AI tools to gauge the penetration of AI in the industry, advantages it offers to makers and how much time and cost makers save after using such tools.
Over the next two to three years, these stakeholders estimate that 40-50% makers in the industry are likely to use AI tools in various stages of a film's production from 15-20% at present. In the same period, these stakeholders estimate that AI will help save 40% of time required for post-production of a film from 20-25% at present. In terms of costs, in the same period, they estimate that producers may be able to save 25-30% of the cost involved in the making of a film from 15-20% at present.

In the pre-production stage of a film, AI plays a critical role in improving and providing relevant information about storyboarding, graphic look, scripting, poster (stills), casting, set design, costume and reece among others.
Debashis Das, an editor and veteran post production expert, said, “Today, all big production houses in the Hindi film industry are using AI tools in the pre-production stage.”
One of the early stages of film-making where AI’s role begins is pitching concepts and ideas.
Siddharth Roy Kapur, founder,
Roy Kapur Films
, said, ""Currently, I can see AI tools being used by production houses, directors and writers in pitching concepts and ideas. This enables a clearer visual representation of the written word.”
Recreating Scenes
Storyboarding (visual representation of scenes) is another key area where AI tools are used considerably.
Gokul A, founder, D.cult Studio, a company which provides AI tools and has provided AI tools to 60 films in the Malayalam language said, ""One of the time-consuming processes in the pre-production is storyboarding. For the film
Jodha Akbar
(2008), the makers took one year for pre-production. Storyboarding took a long time. A storyboard artist will take seven to ten days for drawings. Today, with the help of AI tools, drawings of a storyboard would take eight to ten hours.""
He pointed out that AI tools provide much better output as these tools generate images with colour and lighting instead of just sketches in a storyboarding.
Besides, AI tools provide relatively right promptings about the type of camera to use, lenses, and shots. To a great extent, these tools convert 2D image to 3D. Gokul A of D.cult Studio said, ""AI tools are of great help in providing a clear idea about set design. This is a key reason why it is much easier to make a period film with AI-enabled tools today.""
According to industry observers, these tasks take a long time in a shooting schedule where time is money. A senior executive of a production who wished to be unnamed said, ""With the help of a proper storyboard and a team to implement AI tools, a producer can save five to eight days of shooting days. This is a good saving considering the per day cost of a shooting schedule.”
It is estimated that production cost of a day’s schedule of a Hindi film is in the range of Rs15-50 lakh.
Girish Johar, producer and film business expert, said, “If a producer saves time, then the producer saves money. If a producer saves five to ten days of a shooting schedule because of efficient AI tools, then it is a reasonably good saving.”
In the post-production stage of film-making, AI tools are being used for dubbing, subtitling, Visual Effects (VFX), animation, editing, cleaning and other laborious tasks.
Mautik Tolia, managing director, Bodhitree Multimedia, a content production company, said, ""This is the first phase of Generative AI, which enhances or replaces services. This is most noticeably seen in subtitling and dubbing among others.”
Recently, AI tools were used to dub the Tamil film
Kanguva
in eight languages.
Upgradation and improvement in language templates have made dubbing through AI tools relatively accurate. This has saved time for film-makers.
Bhavika Karwarkar, founder, Mumbai
Posst
House, a post production studio based in Mumbai, said, “Earlier we required three people for dubbing. Today, with the help of AI, we require one person to monitor dubbing. AI tools have a wide range of language templates which help save time in dubbing.”
She added that a lot of tasks related to the backend work done in the post-production stage of a film are being swiftly done through AI tools. She said, ""These tasks in the post-production stage of films form 15-20% of the cost of production of a film. So, one can estimate how much a producer can save."" She estimated that in the next two to three years, 40-45% of film-makers in the Hindi film industry will use AI tools from 15-20% at present.
Editors' Favourite
In addition to dubbing and subtitling, AI tools help save time in editing. The time taken to create a line-up of scenes for editing has been reduced drastically, pointed out veteran editors.
Vaibhav Desai, a veteran editor and owner, Videshi, an editing studio in Mumbai, said, “Once I feed my inputs to a machine using an AI tool in the night, I have a complete line-up of my scenes the next morning. Earlier this whole exercise would take two to three days.” In the next two to three years film-makers will save at least 40% of their time on post-production work as more people use AI tools and more AI tools become available, he added. At present, in the Hindi film industry, AI tools help in saving 20-25% of the time on tasks related to post-production.
A clear and big advantage AI tools have provided Hindi film-makers in recent years is in animation and VFX domains. The spate of spectacle films across languages reflect this trend. Bhavika Karwarkar of Mumbai Posst House said, “AI is mainly used for 2D animation and VFX among other things. This is a great advantage especially if a film has heavy VFX. With AI tools, a director and cinematographer can easily explain lighting, camera angles, and colour of a film to the crew.""
Given these advantages, the Hindi film industry has been experimenting a lot with AI tools in recent years. The much popular de-aging technique is being used prominently in Hindi films. A case in point is the younger version of actor Amitabh Bachchan’s character in the film
Kalki 2898 AD
. Even film director duo Raj & DK used AI tools to create character sketches of their recent web series
Citadel: Honey Bunny.
Down south, the makers of the Tamil film
GOAT
used AI tools to use late actor-politician Vijayakanth’s AI version in the film.
In the West, AI-enabled film-making has become an accepted norm.
On-Tap Intelligence
Suniel Wadhwa, co-founder & director, Karmic Films, said, “In the West, AI is used in every stage of a film's making. These include scriptwriting, audience analysis, real-time virtual production and advanced post-production.” Concurring with him, film editor Debashis Das said, “70-80% of studios in the west use AI tools. If a person from a department of film-making turns up late on a set, then the whole shooting schedule goes for a toss.”
The recently released film
Here
of actor Tom Hanks, which shows a young version of Tom Hanks for the large part of the film is an example of how well AI tools have become integral to film-making in the west. Even director Martin Scorsese’s film
The Irishman
used the de-aging technique seamlessly.
Globally, according to Business Research Company, a global market intelligence firm, generative AI in movies market is estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 24.1% in the next four years to reach to $0.77 billion (Rs6545 crore) by 2028 from $0.32 billion (Rs2720 crore) in 2024. This shows how AI tools are being rapidly adopted.
Although AI tools are being used extensively, the underlying rationale behind their usage is to provide enough time to directors to focus on creative aspects of film-making. Jaidev Hemmady, scriptwriter, said, “AI cannot bring nuances in stories and storytelling. It just saves time. And the time saved must be utilised on improving creative aspects of films. This is a key thing creators must bear in mind.”

This follows the company's earlier announcement on November 18, where Goenka had announced his decision to step down as the MD.
""I hereby tender my resignation from the office of MD of the company with immediate effect to entirely focus on my operational responsibilities,"" Goenka stated in his letter to the board dated November 18.
""Accordingly, I withdraw my consent to be re-appointed as a MD-key managerial personnel of the company proposed in the notice of the ensuing AGM of the company scheduled to be held on November 28, 2024,"" the letter said.
""Further, I am willing to continue as
CEO
of the company if the same can be considered and approved by the board. I wish to express my gratitude towards the board of the company for giving me an opportunity to serve as a MD of the company,"" the letter concluded.

Goenka announced his decision to step down as MD to focus exclusively on his CEO responsibilities. He will remain on the board as a director, pending shareholder approval, with the board endorsing his request to prioritise Zee's operational growth strategy.
Ahead of this change,
Mukund Galgali
, the chief financial officer (CFO), was promoted to deputy CEO while retaining his CFO role. This restructuring, effective immediately, aligns with Zee's aim to streamline leadership and enhance core business focus.
The board has tied 40% of Goenka's variable pay to ambitious performance targets, with provisions for additional compensation if he exceeds the goals by over 100%, subject to a cap.
In a November 15 regulatory filing, the Zee board announced revised quarterly revenue and Ebitda performance metrics for Goenka's role starting Q3 FY25. The board also committed to distributing 25% of consolidated net profits as dividends to shareholders.
In a statement issued by Zee last week, Punit Goenka emphasised that his decision to step down as managing director was aimed at dedicating his efforts to operational priorities as CEO, ensuring the company's core businesses achieve their targeted aspirations. He expressed gratitude to the board for supporting his approach.

, former CEO of Viacom18 Motion Pictures, the studio is actively engaged in discussions with a prominent
strategic partner
from the West. Sources also highlighted significant domestic interest, with two
investment banks
managing the process.
""Given the level we have achieved and the robust slate and order book we possess, we have initiated the process for our next strategic capital raise,"" Malhotra told ET in response to queries, without providing further details.
He disclosed that the capital raise is intended to fund a content slate across both films and
OTT platforms
, valued at Rs 750 crore over the next two years. ""Our content slate is supported by a strong pre-sale, and the order book looks even more promising,"" he added.
Founded in September 2013, Abundantia initially secured funding from Dalip Pathak’s Callista Capital and Ashok Wadhwa's RW Media. Malhotra later bought out the investors, gaining 100% ownership of the company.
Live Events
Abundantia is open to diluting a significant minority stake, typically to a strategic or long-term partner. Malhotra stressed that the key focus is on securing quality capital that aligns with the company's long-term vision, strategic goals, and scalability.
Recently, Abundantia unveiled a diverse and ambitious content slate aimed at younger audiences. Key upcoming projects include Daldal, a Prime Video original series starring Bhumi Pednekar; Chhorii 2, a sequel to its 2021 horror hit; Subedaar, an action-drama starring Anil Kapoor; and Laal, a true-crime film directed by Jai Mehta.
The film and content industry industry is undergoing major disruptions, driven by shifting consumer preferences, heightened exposure to global content, and the growing prevalence of on-demand consumption in urban areas. Concurrently, the economic model is facing strain, with star salaries often consuming up to 70% of a film's budget.
In a notable move reflecting the ongoing consolidation in the sector, billionaire Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, recently acquired a 50% stake in Karan Johar's Dharma Productions for Rs 1,000 crore, valuing the company at Rs 2,000 crore.

To access the cloud streaming beta, users need a PlayStation Portal, a PlayStation Network account, an active PlayStation Plus Premium membership, and a broadband internet connection. The feature can be enabled through the settings menu on the PlayStation Portal once the device is updated to the latest software.

Bhajanlal Sharma

Rajasthan
follows three other
BJP-ruled states
-- Haryana, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh -- in giving the
tax-free
status to the Vikrant Massey-starrer film, which released in theatres last week.
""Our government has taken a meaningful decision to make the film 'The Sabarmati Report' tax-free in Rajasthan,"" Sharma posted on X.
""This film realistically depicts that horrific period of history, which some selfish elements tried to distort to fulfil their vested interests. The film not only effectively exposes the reality of the then system, but also refutes the misleading and false narratives propagated at that time,"" he added.
Directed by Dheeraj Sarna, the film is inspired by true events and also stars Raashii Khanna and Ridhi Dogra in pivotal roles. It is produced by Balaji Motion Pictures.

The Gujarat Police had blamed a Muslim mob for starting the fire, while an enquiry commission constituted by the Railway ministry under the Congress-led UPA government claimed that it was an accident. Courts, however, convicted a number of accused chargesheeted by the police, validating its charge.
Sharma said the ""unfortunate and heartbreaking"" incident has been presented with utmost sensitivity in the film.
""This film must also be watched because only a deep and critical study of the past can help us understand the present and provide guidance for the future,"" he added.
BJP president JP Nadda, along with several party leaders, including MPs Baijayant Jay Panda, Arun Singh and Anil Baluni, on Tuesday watched the movie, which has been endorsed by top functionaries of the government, including

Why Hindi cinema industry losing its daredevil old film producers​,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/why-hindi-cinema-industry-losing-its-daredevil-old-film-producers/articleshow/115438679.cms,19-11-2024,"Recently a key person of an entertainment company met with a veteran Hindi film producer. The producer said to him: ""Abhi Mazaa Nahi Aataa Hain Filmein Produce Karne Main"" (I don't enjoy producing films anymore).
This remark encapsulates the situation of producers in the Hindi film industry. There are mounting challenges in being a producer today. Though this is a concern, a bigger concern is the fading relevance and importance of old and traditional film producers in the industry. Today, industry observers bemoan the gradual fading of passionate and daredevil old Hindi film producers. One of the repercussions of this is the present state of consolidation in the Hindi film industry.
There is a long and arduous journey which has led to this phase in the industry.
This journey is largely about the mindset with which films are being produced today. There is a considerable shift in this mindset. For a long time, producing a Hindi film remained a personal adventure which was fuelled by intense passion and risk-taking which many a time defied logic and common sense. In fact, there is a rule-of-thumb wisdom about Hindi films which many veterans know very well. In a way, it has been the essence of the business of filmmaking in the Hindi film industry for many years. The rule of thumb is: 15 percent of films produced make huge money, 15 percent of films produced recover money and the remaining 70 percent of films produced flop and never recover money. This shows that the enterprise of producing a Hindi film has been largely fraught with tremendous uncertainty and it can be hardly considered as a remunerative business in the conventional sense of the expression. In this context, old Hindi film producers possessed a daredevil spirit, unusual doggedness, infectious passion and creative conviction which germinated into a faith exemplified well in a successful tightrope walker. They were not only clear about their creative visions but also the viability of their enterprises.
It is no wonder that the Hindi film industry is replete with stories which contain elements of triumph, passion, resilience and a faith which is devotional in nature.

Legendary director Raj Kapoor pawned his house and studio to achieve his vision in the film
Mera Naam Joker
(1970). But the film, though critically acclaimed, failed at the box office. Kapoor was in huge debt. There were murmurs of disapproval and scepticism among film distributors about Kapoor’s capabilities as a film director. This failure did not deter the spirit of Raj Kapoor who bounced back with a teenage love story film
Bobby
(1973) which turned out to be a massive success at the box office. There is another equally fascinating story of the pioneer and inimitable film director
V Shantaram
who told his son to blend his ashes with the earth of his studio whose name echoed the deep convictions and devotional sentiments he had for cinema:
Rajkamal Kalamandir
.
These two stories show what distinguished successful old film directors and producers from the present ones. They were not only uncompromising in their vision but for them cinema was the be-all and end-all of their lives.
In the past ten or more years, these old film producers could not keep up with changing times in the Hindi film industry. One of the changes in the Hindi film industry which emerged as a competition to these old producers is a parallel force in the form of studios, corporate culture, actors and directors. Actors and directors turned producers. In this parallel force, studios emerged as a force to reckon with. They had access to relatively higher reservoirs of funding than old and traditional film producers. Out of sheer vanity, lack of alertness and overestimation of one's capabilities in securing funds, old film producers became complacent and could not promptly arrange new sources of funds. They believed that they would not have to scout for new sources of funds given their long experience in producing films.
This situation can be understood with an example. Suppose a veteran Hindi film producer makes a film on a budget of Rs14 crore. This film earns Rs30 crore at the box office. As time and costs associated with producing films—fees of actors and their entourage and other costs—increased, budgets of films also increased. So, the same size of a film required funding of Rs30 crore. But the same old producer could not manage newer and better sources of funding to fund the Rs30 crore-film. This made these old producers irrelevant in the Hindi film industry. It is estimated that the number of independent old film producers has been reduced to less than five from 15 to 20 before the Corona-virus induced pandemic.
Simultaneously, a parallel force emerged as an alternative to these old film producers. This force included studios, actors, directors and other investors. This force gained more strength in funding Hindi films and gave rise to a culture in the industry whose sole objective has been on recovering money invested in films much before their release in theatres. As a result, films became 'projects' and a standardised approach was followed in recovering money invested in these projects through sale of rights--streaming (digital), music, overseas, and satellite (television) in the pre-production stage of a film. So, box office revenues of films became profits for the parallel force. The success ratio of this approach has been debatable and it has been far from encouraging for it to emerge as an accepted norm in the industry.
There were two aspects on which old and traditional film producers scored an edge over the parallel force. One is they had an acute understanding of creativity and creative vision. And the other is decision-making. In the culture created by old and traditional film producers, decisions were taken by a single person. This is a reason why there is a unity and clarity of creative vision in films produced by old film producers. Unlike this, in the culture created by the parallel force, there are too many decision-makers who hamper the creative vision of film.
In a culture created by the parallel force of producers, great deal attention did not go to investing in films. A large part of investments went into unnecessary costs. High fees of actors and their entourage inflated a film’s costs. Besides this, this parallel force of producers alienated a vast majority of the audience by inserting elements of ideology which did not blend or amalgamate well within these films. Consequently, these films became highly unimaginative and unemotional. This parallel force of producers paid a huge cost for not being hands-on in managing and channelising investments in films. Their films failed to recover money. Some of these entities suffered huge losses on their investments in big-budget films. They also could not make films which could help them recover the losses they incurred on big-budget films. Their fixed expenses related to salaries of their staff, office and importantly, maintaining their own lifestyle, also increased. As a result, these entities found it difficult to sustain independently. These facts are the geneses of the recent phase of consolidation in the Hindi film industry.
A problematic aspect which has plagued the Hindi film industry is the mindset of ‘greed’. Earlier, old and traditional producers made good money after recovering money through theatres and sale of various rights. At present, this is not the case. It seems the parallel force of producers is in a constant quest of creating and achieving jackpots at the box office.
In a sharp contrast to this, producers in the southern film industry function more like old Hindi film producers. They are hands-on and closely monitor investments in their films. They are willing to invest wholeheartedly in a film and not in fulfilling ego-pampering wishes of a film’s actors and their entourage. In this way, they achieve a creative vision and not just the ordeal task of completing a film which is not in sync with a director’s vision. This is a key reason why a big-budget southern film has a total crew (cast, entourage and other crew members) up to 400 compared to more than 750 in a big-budget Hindi film. This efficient management of costs is a fundamental reason why southern film-makers are repeatedly able to make big-budget films, unlike their Hindi film counterparts. In fact, such is the confidence of the makers in the southern film industry that they focus on selling digital rights of a film only after releasing the film theatrically and not in the pre-production stage of the film.
Today, the demand for content is huge. It is vitally important to cater to this demand by embarking on a film like a personal mission rather than a ‘business project’. This approach has paid off in recent years. The success of Hindi film
12
th
Fail
and umpteen southern films on a pan-India level indicates the effectiveness of this approach. Therefore, unless there emerges an alert bunch of creators who fully understand creativity and who seamlessly amalgamate the demands of the market forces within a film without compromising its creative vision, the Hindi film industry will continue to face the aforementioned challenges.

The film has already seen several controversies after Sikh organisations, including the Shiromani Akali Dal, accused it of misrepresenting the community and getting facts wrong.
At the time, Ranaut had accused the CBFC of stalling certification, which she said was ""hugely demotivating"".
The film delves into the emergency that was imposed by the former prime minister Indira Gandhi for 21 months from 1975 to 1977 and its aftermath.
Produced by
Zee Studios
and
Manikarnika Films
, the movie also features Anupam Kher, Shreyas Talpade, Mahima Chaudhry, Milind Soman, and the late Satish Kaushik.

Dubai-based siblings to transfer jiohotstar.com domain to Reliance 'free of cost',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/dubai-based-siblings-to-transfer-jiohotstar-com-domain-to-reliance-free-of-cost/articleshow/115383209.cms,17-11-2024,"Dubai-based siblings Jainam and Jivika, the owners of
jiohotstar
.com domain, have decided to transfer it to
Reliance
""free of cost"", resting speculations on social media platforms. The story of the internet domain name, which grabbed a lot of attention on social media platforms in the recent past, ended with ""seva and kindness"", according to the duo.
The unique website ID was said to have been initially registered by a Delhi-based app developer last year amid speculation about the potential merger of
Reliance Jio
and
Disney Hotstar
.
Last month, the developer came up with the demand for funding his higher studies at the Cambridge University in return of the domain's ownership transfer, days after
Reliance
Jio and The Walth Disney formally announced the merger of their media businesses.
Later, the Dubai-based siblings purchased jiohotstar.com domain from its registered owner. According to industry observers, the domain was sold to Dubai-based siblings after Reliance declined his offer.
The siblings now shared an update, saying the Reliance IP Legal team approached them and the duo has decided to pass the ownership to them (Reliance), hoping that it would be ""useful for them"".
Live Events
""Reliance IP legal team has approached us, and we will be transferring this domain to them, free of cost,"" they said in a message on the website.
""There have been some rumours online suggesting that there is a payment or deal involved, but we want to make it clear -- this is not true,"" the message said.
Moreover, the duo in his video also clarified there is ""no pressure from anyone"" and denied of having a ""deal of any kind"".
""This is purely a transfer of the domain from our side because we believe it could be useful for them. Whether or not they choose to use it is up to them,"" the message added.
PTI reached out to Reliance for its comment on the development but did not receive any response.
In their previous message, the siblings said they had received numerous offers, including some genuine ones offering significant amounts. However, they had said that the domain was not for sale.
While announcing the ""journey with jiohotstar.com is coming to an end"", the duo said they are waiting for a draft from the Reliance legal team for the transfer.
""The Reliance IP legal team has contacted us. We have told them that the domain transfer will only happen after the agreement is signed. They have asked us to visit Mumbai to sign the agreement,"" they said, expecting the agreement to be signed soon.
""As soon as this happens, we will transfer the domain and this website will come to an end,"" the message said.
Reliance had last week announced completion of the merger of its media assets with the India business of global media giant The Walt Disney, forming a joint venture worth around Rs 70,352 crore (USD 8.5 billion).
The JV will be one of the largest media and entertainment companies in India with a combined revenue of approximately Rs 26,000 crore and will be led by
Nita Ambani
as its chairperson.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the transaction on August 28, 2024, subject to the compliance with certain voluntary modifications offered by the parties including selling seven linear TV channels and not bundling TV and digital ad slots for cricketing rights.

Star India
Tuesday incurred a standalone net loss of Rs 12,548 crore for the financial year ending March 31. In a regulatory filing, the broadcaster blamed the weak financial performance to a provision of Rs 12,319 crore for an ""onerous contract"" stemming from the International Cricket Council (ICC) media rights deal.
""The company has estimated the contract with ICC to be onerous as the expected revenue from customers relating to this right as and when the related event is broadcasted/streamed is likely to be less than the cost involved in broadcasting and streaming these events and hence has estimated a loss from future events relating to these media rights to be Rs 12,319.31 crore as of 31 March 2024,"" Star India said. It added that the judgments and estimates may vary in future due to the uncertainty involved with them.
This qualifies as an impairment under global accounting standards and will be recognised over the coming years.
Star had acquired the ICC TV and digital rights for a whopping $3 billion for a four-year period till 2027. Subsequently, the company sub-licenced the TV rights to
Zee Entertainment
, which eventually decided against proceeding with the deal after the collapse of its merger pact with Sony Group Corp's India units in January.
Zee’s financial constraints also did not permit a significant investment in an expensive cricket property like the ICC rights.

Stung by Zee's volte face, Star initiated arbitration proceedings against the Punit Goenka-led company at the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) seeking $940 million in damages.
Zee, in a September regulatory filing, had refuted Star's claims, stating that the arbitration process was still in its early stages and that the LCIA had yet to determine the company's liability.
Star India, currently in the final stages of merging with Reliance Industries-backed Viacom18, had reported a standalone net profit of Rs 1,465 crore in FY23.
Operating revenue declined by over 6% to Rs 18,587 crore in FY24 from Rs 19,812 crore in the year before, while expenses surged by over 68% to Rs 31,548 crore from Rs 18,724 crore due to the provision for the contract.
The company's advertising revenue dropped by 4% to Rs 10,736 crore, while subscription revenue decreased by over 1% to Rs 6,909 crore.
Star India declined to comment on the financial results.
Meanwhile, Star has also filed an application on 30 September 2024, with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai for the amalgamation of Star Television Productions Ltd (STPL), a limited liability company incorporated in British Virgin Islands, with the company.
The merger scheme, which is yet to receive the NCLT approval, was approved by the boards of both companies on 24 September. Once it is approved by the NCLT, the company is required to fulfil conditions specified in the scheme for the amalgamation to be effective.
In May, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT approved the merger of Novi Digital Entertainment, which housed the Disney+ Hotstar streaming business, with Star India.
With all major regulatory approvals from the Competition Commission of India, the NCLT and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Star's merger with Viacom18 is nearing completion, and the leadership team has more or less been finalised.
Currently, Star India owns and operates 77 TV channels across entertainment, sports and kids' categories, in addition to the Disney+ Hotstar streaming platform. Disney+ Hotstar, previously managed by Novi Digital Entertainment, has now been integrated into Star.
Viacom18 reported a net loss of Rs 252 crore for FY24, compared with a net profit of Rs 11 crore in the previous fiscal year. The loss was attributed to significant investments in sports and streaming. Revenue rose 75% to Rs 8,032 crore.
As per the merger agreement, Star India is valued at Rs 26,000 crore and Viacom18 at Rs 33,000 crore. Reliance is set to infuse Rs 11,500 crore into Star India, which will consolidate the TV and streaming assets of both Star and Viacom18.
Following the merger, Reliance will hold a 56% stake in Star India, while Disney will own 37%, and Uday Shankar and James Murdoch's Bodhi Tree Systems will hold 7%. Nita Ambani will serve as the chairperson of the merged entity and Uday Shankar will be the vice-chair.

The
Reserve Bank of India
(RBI), which was set up in 1935, completed 90 years in April this year.
Star India Private Limited, Viacom 18, Zee Entertainment Network Limited and Discovery Communications India were in the fray for ""Production and distribution of Web Series Commemorating 90 years of RBI"" after the central bank floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) in July.
While Zee Entertainment Network and Discovery Communications India did not qualify beyond the technical evaluation round, Star India Pvt Ltd and Viacom 18 made it to the final round.
According to the RBI, Star India has been awarded the tender for Rs 6.5 crore to make the web series.
As per the RFP document, the RBI had desired the creation of a web series of five episodes of approximately 25-30 minutes each, which can be aired on national TV channels and/or OTT platforms, commemorating 90 years journey of the RBI.
Live Events
The five-episode series will serve as a valuable resource for enhancing public understanding of the central bank's vital role in the economy, fostering greater engagement, and building trust and confidence in its operations and policies, it said in the document.
The RBI had invited proposals from production houses, TV channels, and OTT platforms.
The primary objective of the project, according to the RBI, is to create a comprehensive and engaging series to provide an in-depth exploration of the RBI functions and operations over its 90-year journey.
""By achieving these objectives, the series with a total of 5 episodes with a duration of approx. 25-30 minutes each will serve as a valuable resource for enhancing public understanding of the central bank's vital role in the economy, fostering greater engagement, and building trust and confidence in its operations and policies,"" said the RBI's Request for Proposal (RFP) issued in July.
The series aims to highlight the central bank's vision and mission, showcase its significant achievements and initiatives, and provide insights into ongoing developments and collaborations.
""Through compelling storytelling, expert interviews, and high-quality visuals, the web series seeks to enhance transparency and build trust in the central bank's operations and policies,"" the RBI has said while inviting the bids.
The series aims to make complex financial concepts accessible and interesting to a broad audience, thereby, contributing to
financial literacy

Does the strategy of focusing more on premium audiences pay rich dividends to exhibitors?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/does-the-strategy-of-focusing-more-on-premium-audiences-pay-rich-dividends-to-exhibitors/articleshow/115139635.cms,10-11-2024,"There are a few developments in 2024 concerning the exhibition industry which are worth noting. It started with
Cinema Lovers Day
on May 31. Then, September 20 was celebrated as
National Cinema Day
. On both days, multiplexes capped ticket price at Rs99. This was followed by re-releasing old films which stakeholders in the exhibition industry said would be an ongoing strategy if the pipeline of Hindi films is not strikingly good enough to attract footfalls in theatres. In a sharp contrast to the prevalent business strategy of multiplexes, Mukta A2 Cinemas capped prices of food and beverages at Rs99.
Quite expectedly, these initiatives have borne fruits. It is estimated that 30 lakh tickets were sold across languages and formats on the National
Cinema
Day itself. Even Hindi films which were re-released in theatres recorded higher collections than when they were released. A prime example is the Hindi film Tumbbad, which collected over Rs36 crore on its re-release. This is much higher than close to Rs16 crore the film collected when it was released in 2018. A key reason for this is exhibitors offered tickets in the range of Rs110-150. All these favourable developments have transpired when fresh films in the Hindi film industry are failing at the box office.
This shows that when tickets are priced economically people come to theatres irrespective whether a film is old or new.
This fact leads to a key question: Does the excessive focus on the premium audience pay rich dividends to exhibitors?
Watching movies in theatres has largely been associated with the masses. There are two telling observations of two critically acclaimed film-makers—Danny Boyle and Quentin Tarantino—in the 2016 The Hollywood Roundtable—Directors, which explain this culture quite well. In the roundtable, director Quentin Tarantino highlighted high ticket prices in theatres in the US as a key challenge in cinema. He said, “It (Movies) is a working man’s art form. It is not opera. It is not theatre. It is not a big concert. The idea was anybody could go and see a
movie
. This is not the case anymore. We have priced them out.” In the same roundtable director Danny Boyle said, “A film should reach the widest audience. Ordinary people at the end of a tough week just want to go and lose themselves in some extraordinary idea, image or creation.”

These two observations hold true even in the context of the Hindi film industry. To a considerable extent, it is the masses in India who made movies into a great carnival. This carnival provided the masses the required energy, hope and faith to embrace and accept wholeheartedly life’s uncertainties, pleasant and unasked-for gifts. Movies nourished, enriched, and fuelled the imagination of the masses in India. Great moments in movies transported the masses to a universe which activated a dormant self in them which transcended the limitations of the real world and expressed itself in the most unabashed, comprehensive and intense form. Identifying with these dormant elements within one’s own self even for a few hours made the lives of the masses liveable to a certain degree. Actors and actresses who were able companions in these journeys were nothing short of stars which brightened the dark firmament of the masses. So, it is not a wonder that the masses and not the premium audience who gave birth to the tradition and cult of stardom. And these superstars were a convincing reason for the masses to flock to theatres.
But over the years as ticket prices became expensive, watching movies in theatre no longer remained a ‘ritual’ with the masses. It became a ‘decision’ which required deliberation. In a large sense, the mass audience has always been more forgiving, accommodating and a champion of the old grammar of the Hindi film industry as long as the whole investment in a film outing remained cost-effective. This is because the primary expectation of a large part of the mass audience from Hindi movies has been a ‘relief’ from their monotonous and tedious lives. This expectation when fulfilled was duly rewarded by this section of audience by repeat attendance in theatres.
But as more and more films provided unsatisfactory experiences and did not compensate for high prices of tickets and food and beverages, the mass audience was compelled to compare the cost of a family outing in a theatre with buying new forms of entertainment available to them. These new forms of entertainment include content on social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and streaming platforms. This has made the masses more price-conscious day by day given the wide range of entertainment offered by social media and streaming platforms.
Expensive tickets have not been a dampener for premium audiences if an outing to a theatre lived up to their expectations. So, they have been willing to pay for three essential Ps of the exhibition business: Picture, Popcorn and Parking. Given the high margins in the food and beverages segment, exhibitors have been focusing more on increasing prices of food and beverages. Then, they also launched an array of premium offerings related to films and unrelated to a film outing. As a result of this, today, a visit to theatres has become more than just ‘watching’ a film.
But the premium audience has turned out to be more discerning and clearer about what it wants to watch in theatres. This audience comes to theatres for a clear deal: either ‘meaning’ in films or ‘experience’ around films or even both. Such specific expectations may not be fulfilled every time by a movie. This explains the irregular attendance or fickle nature of the premium audience when it comes to a film outing in theatres.
So, a moot question which has emerged from these facts is: Can exhibitors have the best of both worlds? Can they expect a large crowd in theatres like the mass audience and expect them to pay like the premium audience? This seems to be a difficult proposition because a large number of films have been failing at the box office in the past few years. This is a key reason why viewers often remark nowadays: “Quality of films has not improved but ticket prices have gone up.”
The thought process behind high ticket prices is largely a reflection of the way exhibitors look at theatres nowadays. Girish Wankhede, a veteran in exhibition business and movie trade analyst, said, “Luxury has become a priority of exhibitors. They are interested in creating luxury theatres which offer ambience like a five-star hotel. This necessitates high pricing of tickets, and food and beverages. But this acts as a dampener for the mass audience who are more interested in watching a film.”
In the southern region, ticket prices are not charged more than Rs 250. As a result of this, theatres in the southern region have occupancy of 70 %. Occupancy in the non-southern region stands close to 40%. This is largely because of high ticket and food and beverages prices. So, offering tickets and food and beverages in a reasonable price range can be a prudent strategy for exhibitors. This strategy has worked in recent months. A distinct advantage of this strategy is even films which are moderately good make reasonably good or respectable business at the box office. This adds to the overall box office revenues of the industry. Also, it is a win-win deal for audiences and exhibitors.

Sony's PS5 Pro to give India a miss,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/sonys-ps5-pro-to-give-india-a-miss/articleshow/115094247.cms,08-11-2024,"Sony on Thursday said its Playstation 5 Pro gaming console will not be available in India because of compatibility issues with the available spectrum bands.
""PS5 Pro will not be available in some countries (which presently includes India) where 6GHz wireless band used in IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) has not yet been allowed,"" the Japanese company said in an official statement.
Playstation 5 Pro uses Wi-Fi 7, a wireless standard that uses the 6GHz band for connecting to the internet. In India, the 6GHz band is being used by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) for satellite purposes. It has not been opened for commercial services because of a tussle between telecom service providers and tech companies over who should get it.
While telecom operators are pushing for it to be reserved for mobile internet services, big tech companies like Amazon, Google and Meta, along with router makers, are pushing for its delicensing for use in Wi-Fi services. In India, Wi-Fi services are offered in the 2.5GHz and the 5GHz bands.

"After fireworks, big budget movies fizzle at the box office on unfavourable reviews",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/after-fireworks-big-budget-movies-fizzle-at-the-box-office-on-unfavourable-reviews/articleshow/115063077.cms,08-11-2024,"Mumbai: The trade circuit lowered its combined box-office expectations from
Singham Again
and
Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3
to ₹500-600 crore from ₹1,000-1,100 crore, following unfavourable word-of-mouth publicity over the past four days and a dip in collections.
Film distributor and trade analyst
Shaaminder Malik
said that while successful big-budget films usually see a 15-20% drop on Monday before regaining momentum, both films have seen a steady decline in collections since Sunday.
""Expectations for these two films are limited now,"" he said. According to early reports from
Sacnilk
, the Diwali releases Singham Again and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 have seen a steady decline in box-office collections over the past six days. Both films opened strongly, earning about ₹43.5 crore and ₹35.5 crore, respectively on Friday. However, by Sunday, collections had dipped to about ₹35.75 crore and ₹33.5 crore. The downward trend continued, with the films' earnings dropping to about ₹10.25 crore and ₹10.5 crore by Wednesday.
""Generally speaking, if word-of-mouth recommendations of big films are positive, then their collections progressively improve during a week. Since the word-of-mouth recommendations of both these are a mixed bag, their collections began to decline from Sunday itself,"" said Girish Wankhede, a film trade analyst.
Live Events
He added, ""Ultimately, it boils down to content. The content of both films is not appreciated well. There is no repeat value in these films. Even the music in both films lacks depth. Neither of the two films has found takers among audiences, which is reflected in their falling collections.""
A section of exhibitors is of the view that the collections at the end of the second week of the release of these two films will be crucial in gauging how they will perform in the coming weeks.
Devang Sampat, managing director at
Cinepolis India
, said, ""I believe the true test of these films will be the second week. Both films are working well right now. I believe that both films have surpassed the box office numbers of their previous franchise films."" According to Sacnilk, Singham Again collected ₹164.2 crore in the first six days of its release, while Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 collected ₹148.7 crore.

Film Producer Tutu Sharma to launch multiplex chain Citara in tier-II and tier-III cities,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/film-producer-tutu-sharma-to-launch-multiplex-chain-citara-in-tier-ii-and-tier-iii-cities/articleshow/115002923.cms,06-11-2024,"Film producer Tutu Sharma has announced his plans to launch a multiplex chain under the name Citara targeting specifically tier-II and tier-III cities of India.
“There is a section of the audience who wants to watch films in theatres. This audience wants to watch films at a ticket price which is reasonably priced. We want to cater to this audience,” said Tutu Sharma, founder,
Citara Entertainment
.
Sharma’s Citara multiplex chain will cater specifically to tier-II and tier-III cities. He said that the multiplex chain will offer tickets at 30-40% cheaper than the Average Ticket Price (ATP) in the exhibition industry.
This multiplex chain will start operations in Jaipur, Indore, Ujjain, Kota, Beed, and Nandgaon by the end of November 2024 with around 15 screens.
According to Sharma, the screen capacity in each of these multiplexes will be in the range of 90-110. Ticket prices in these multiplexes will be in the range of Rs 150-175. By the end of FY26, Citara Entertainment plans to increase its screen count to 150 from 15 by the end of November 2024.
Live Events
Girish Johar, group content advisor, at Citara Entertainment said, “There are huge opportunities in the tier-II and tier-III cities. Cinema is part of our DNA. We want to tap into the audience which prefers an affordable moviegoing experience.”
According to a study by research firm JLL India, tier-II and tier-III cities are experiencing a surge in new retail supply with 25 million square feet of retail developments expected to come on stream in the next five years. The study noted, “Retailer confidence in these cities has grown due to the influx of high-quality supply from established developers.” It added, “Premium and bridge-to-luxury brands are also venturing into these cities, driven by rising consumer aspirations and new opportunities for store openings.” According to the study, some of the retailers have also selected tier-II and tier-III cities to open their first stores in the country such as Daiso Japan at Elante Mall in Chandigarh and Charles Tyrwhitt at Palladium Ahmedabad.
These facts provide strong business opportunities for the exhibition business.
In addition to affordable pricing, the multiplex chain will have other entertainment avenues which include celebrity jewellery and fashion retailing, gym and kids’ corner.

"Weekend dhamaka at Box Office: Collections from Singham Again, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 top Rs 230 cr, lift exhibitors’ hopes",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/weekend-dhamaka-at-box-office-collections-from-singham-again-bhool-bhulaiyaa-3-top-rs-230-cr-lift-exhibitors-hopes/articleshow/114956720.cms,05-11-2024,"Mumbai: Encouraging response to the much-awaited big-budget releases-Singham Again and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3-on the Diwali weekend has provided some respite to exhibitors who were struggling with a dry spell of no fresh release for a few weeks.
According to early reports from the trade circuit, the combined collection of these two releases for the last weekend (Friday to Sunday) was ₹231.4 crore. While Singham Again made box-office collections of ₹121.2 crore, Bhool Bhulaiyaa collected ₹110.2 crore, they said. ""After a long period, two big films released in theatres on the same day. The festival period provided the much-needed boost required at the box office in terms of strong collections,"" said Girish Wankhade, a movie trade analyst.
These films, however, are not competing at the box office, he said. ""Screens were not proportionately shared between these two films. The ratio of screen count between the two films is 60:40 with Singham Again receiving 60% of the total screens...""
Singham Again is distributed by PVR Inox Pictures, the distribution arm of multiplex giant PVR Inox, which runs 1,747 screens. Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is distributed by AA Films, which is owned by Anil Thadani, a pan-India distributor. Besides higher share of screens and huge star cast, the scale and production quality of the Singham cop universe or franchise have worked in its favour and resulted in higher collections. Due to this, according to trade analysts, the budget of Singham Again is estimated to be in the range of ₹300-₹350 crore, while Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is made at a cost of ₹150 crore.

Film distributor and trade analyst Shaaminder Malik said: ""Though the opening weekend of both these big-budget films have generated good collections, one must also bear in mind that collections of both these films on Monday and Tuesday will be the litmus test.""
Collections had dropped for both on Sunday after they secured high interest from audiences for the first two days, he said.
Exhibitors will decide on increasing or decreasing shows of these films based on how they fare on Monday and Tuesday, analysts said. A trade analyst who wished to be unnamed said: ""At present, there is a drop in collections of both films on Sunday. So, exhibitors will not favour any one of these two films immediately."" He added that through word-of-mouth publicity it will be clear only by either Tuesday or Wednesday as to which film will get more shows in the coming weeks.
Interestingly, amid their release, these two films have successfully sold their streaming or digital rights.

DTH players' FY24 revenue down amid major subscriber loss,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/dth-players-fy24-revenue-down-amid-major-subscriber-loss/articleshow/114918621.cms,03-11-2024,"The combined revenue of Indian private DTH companies
Tata Play
,
Bharti Telemedia
,
Dish TV
and
Sun Direct
fell more than 5% to ₹10,230 crore in the last fiscal year ended in March, amid an increasing shift among consumers towards digital platforms for watching video including live content.
The Performance Indicator Report of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, which regulates the DTH sector, also highlighted a significant
subscriber loss
of 3.28 million for the industry.
Bharti Telemedia, part of
Bharti Airtel
, was the only operator to show growth in revenue, which rose 3% to ₹3,045 crore. Tata Play, which also provides broadband services, posted a 6% fall in
DTH revenue
at ₹3,983 crore.
In Bharti Airtel's annual report, chief executive Gopal Vittal said: ""After two years of decline, we grew our customer base by 201k, the only operator in the industry to grow its customer base during the year.""
Airtel Digital TV, the DTH brand of Bharti Telemedia, had 16.1 million customers at the end of the fiscal year, compared with 15.9 million a year earlier.
Live Events
Dish TV, the sole listed DTH provider, posted an 18% revenue drop to ₹1,856 crore, while Sun Direct's revenue fell 1.46% to ₹1,346 crore.
Profitability was mixed for DTH companies with Sun Direct being the only operator to report a profit, posting ₹9 crore compared with a ₹5 crore loss the previous year.
Tata Play reported a ₹247 crore loss in the DTH segment, compared with a ₹20 crore profit in FY23. Bharti Telemedia reduced its net loss by 78% to ₹76 crore, while Dish TV's net loss widened 17% to ₹1,966 crore, mainly due to deferred tax asset adjustments.
Rising competition from OTT and DD Free Dish services has driven DTH operators to aggregate
OTT services
and offer HD and hybrid STBs to increase average revenue per user and curb churn.
Dish TV anticipates a shift away from traditional set-top boxes, marking a significant change in its business model and reducing capital costs, chief executive Manoj Dobhal said in the company's annual report.
Consolidation discussions have intensified with churn and content consolidation reshaping the DTH landscape. On October 8, ET reported Bharti Airtel was in talks to buy Tata Play from Tata Sons and Disney, which hold 70% and 30% stakes, respectively.
The number of DTH operators has already shrunk from six to four, with Videocon d2h merging into
Dish TV
and Reliance Digital TV winding down after being sold to Veecon Media.
The pay-DTH base contracted to 62 million in FY24 from 70 million in FY21, though the first quarter of this fiscal year saw a modest gain of 0.2 million subscribers, driven by cricket events.
Tata Play holds a 33% market share of the pay-DTH market, followed by Bharti Telemedia (28%), Dish TV (20%) and Sun Direct (19%). DD Free Dish, Prasar Bharati's free DTH service, reaches an estimated 40 million homes.

Total expenditure for Los Gatos Production rose 16% to Rs 3,644 crore due to increased content production. Netflix revealed its 2024 content slate in February, comprising 14 shows and eight films.
Purchases made for resale reached Rs 3,431 crore, a 17% increase from Rs 2,923 crore. Personnel expenses remained stable at Rs 36 crore, while administrative costs fell by 10% to Rs 159 crore. Partner contributions towards Los Gatos Production increased 30% to Rs 5,700 crore, while cash and cash equivalents rose 14% to Rs 1,046 crore.
Netflix India
declined to comment on the financials.
On its July 18 second-quarter earnings call, California-based Netflix Inc highlighted India as the second-largest market globally for paid net subscriber additions in the June-ended quarter and third in revenue percentage growth. The content line-up, led by the web series ‘Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar’, bolstered this growth.
During the call, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos commented that Netflix’s growth in India mirrored its success in other markets, where content-market fit drove member acquisition, retention, and monetisation.
Sarandos highlighted that Heeramandi, directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, was Netflix India’s biggest drama series, with 15 million views. The platform also disclosed that Amar Singh Chamkila achieved 8.3 million views, while licensed films like Laapataa Ladies and Shaitaan also contributed to subscriber growth.
""Our original films and licensed films, including those released in the pay-TV window following theatrical releases, continue to thrill our members,” Sarandos said in July.
During the third-quarter earnings call on October 17, Co-CEO Greg Peters reiterated that markets like India exemplified Netflix’s decade-long investment in local creative communities, partnering with storytellers to help them deliver compelling narratives to audiences.

"Singham Again vs Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3: Exhibitors bet on horror, action this Diwali",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/singham-again-vs-bhool-bhulaiyaa-3-exhibitors-bet-on-horror-action-this-diwali/articleshow/114835320.cms,01-11-2024,"With both ""
Singham Again
"" and ""
Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3
"" set to clash at the box office on Friday, the exhibitors and trade experts are hoping that these star-studded franchise films will help them recover some of the losses this festive season. Both the films will be showcased in over 6,000 screens in cinemas nationwide during the Diwali weekend.
According to exhibitors, ""Singham Again"", the latest title in Rohit Shetty's cop universe, has an edge as it has secured 60 per cent of the screens, while Kartik Aaryan-starrer ""
Bhool Bhulaiyaa
3"" will occupy the remaining 40 per cent.
Trade experts predict that ""Singham Again"" will open in the Rs 40-45 crore range, while ""Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3"" could earn around Rs 20-25 crore.
Ashish Kanakia, CEO of MovieMax Cinema, hoped for a robust footfall in theatres.
""Both films cater to large, loyal fanbases and bring unique flavours to the screen, which should attract diverse audience segments. We're optimistic this could be a turning point for the exhibition sector, helping recover some of this year's losses. Blockbuster releases around festivals have historically brought audiences back in large numbers, and we expect this trend to continue,"" Kanakia told PTI.
Live Events
""Singham Again"", the third installment in the ""Singham"" series, features
Ajay Devgn
, Kareena Kapoor Khan,
Ranveer Singh
, Akshay Kumar,
Deepika Padukone
, Tiger Shroff, and Arjun Kapoor.
""Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3"", directed by Anees Bazmee, sees Aaryan reprise his role as Rooh Baba from the previous film. Vidya Balan, who played Avni/Manjulika in the original 2007 film by Priyadarshan, returns to the franchise, with Madhuri Dixit joining as a new addition.
This year, horror-comedies ""Stree 2"" and ""Munjya"" turned out to be two of the biggest hits at the box office and the makers of ""Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3"" hope to capitalise the audience interest in the genre.
Only a few other films, such as Devgn's ""Shaitaan"" and Kiran Rao's ""Lapaataa Ladies"" have achieved success at the ticket window in an otherwise dull year that was mostly dominated by re-release of old hits.
Some of the movies featuring big names like Devgn's ""Maidaan,"" ""Bade Miyan Chote Miyan"" with Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff, and Aaryan's ""Chandu Champion,"" failed to click with the audience.
Bihar-based exhibitor Vishek Chauhan, however, believes the upcoming box office clash should have been avoided given the industry's recent losses.
""I'm hoping for a miracle where both films succeed. 'Singham Again' is a bigger franchise and likely to perform better. It should attract larger crowds at single screens because of its mass appeal, while in multiplexes and bigger cities, it will be more balanced between 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3' and 'Singham Again',"" Chauhan told PTI.
Trade analyst Atul Mohan noted that the films could have performed even better without the competition.
""'Singham Again' might have reached Rs 50 crore or more, and 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3' could have achieved Rs 35-40 crore. Both films have the potential to do well if the content is strong, as the next major release, 'Pushpa 2,' isn't until December,"" he told PTI.
Amit Sharma, MD of Miraj Entertainment Limited, also suggested that the two films will likely impact each other's business.
""The clash between 'Singham Again' and 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3' is going to be interesting. Both films have the potential to surpass Rs 1,000 crore in lifetime collections,"" Sharma told PTI.
Senior distributor and exhibitor Raj Bansal, based in Jaipur, estimated the combined first-day collection of both films to be around Rs 90 crore.
""Diwali clashes aren't new; they're quite common. It's important to note that two films are releasing on Diwali pujan day, which the industry considers the weakest day of the year for box office sales,"" Bansal told PTI, explaining how people like to spend the day with their family rather than stepping out to watch a movie.
At an event earlier this month, Aaryan expressed confidence in both films' success. ""Diwali is such a big holiday that two films can run simultaneously in theatres. 'Singham Again' is an action film, while ours is a horror comedy. It's a rare and exciting moment to have two options on the same day. I think audiences are eagerly waiting for both,"" he said.
In south, there is more buzz around ""Singham Again,"" according to Chennai-based trade analyst Ramesh Bala. He shared that the two films will release on 750 to 1,000 screens across select cities like Chennai, Coimbatore, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Cochin.
""'Singham Again' has an edge due to its star-studded cast, including Ajay, Akshay, Deepika, Ranveer, and others who enjoy strong popularity here. However, both films look promising,"" Bala said.

India next billion-user market for Warner Music: CEO Robert Kyncl,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/india-next-billion-user-market-for-warner-music-ceo-robert-kyncl/articleshow/114663630.cms,28-10-2024,"India, alongside China, is one of the top two global expansion markets for
Warner Music
Group, valued at $16 billion, and represents the next billion-user market, CEO
Robert Kyncl
told ET.
The New York-headquartered company, with over $6 billion in annual revenue, is actively seeking acquisition opportunities in India. Kyncl emphasised Warner's goal to expand its presence in the region, encouraging the local team to accelerate deal flow.
India ranks fifth in global GDP but only 14th in the music market, showing a gap with significant growth potential, Kyncl said. He believes that as GDP rises, advertising revenue and music subscriptions will grow, and India's music industry could eventually rank alongside its GDP.
India's diversity in languages and genres presents Warner Music with unique opportunities to explore and promote regional music on a global scale. ""India is like a continent, with diverse genres and regional music that can matter even more globally,"" Kyncl added.

Zee Entertainment reinstates increments from September 1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-entertainment-reinstates-increments-from-september-1/articleshow/114585037.cms,25-10-2024,"Zee Entertainment
Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) has reinstated
salary increments
, effective September 1, 2024, following previous cost-cutting measures that resulted in a 15%
workforce reduction
, Mukund Galgali, ZEEL's Chief Financial Officer, confirmed this update during the company’s Q2 earnings call on October 18.
Mahesh Pratap Singh, ZEEL's Head of Investor Relations, noted that one month of this salary increment has been factored into the quarter's results, ending September.
""From a Q2 standpoint you already have one month of increment in the numbers in that sense because these were effective 1st September. So, to that extent, the one month of cost is already in the numbers,"" Singh said.
ZEEL's consolidated employee benefits expense decreased by over 12% to Rs 228 crore, with the figure remaining flat quarter-on-quarter.
Singh highlighted that while specific figures for employee benefit expense inflation cannot be shared, the company maintains strict cost controls that will be visible in future performance.

""Yes, you should think of a little bit of effect of that coming in, but also keep in mind that our efficiencies have been coming in during the course of Q2 and you may not have had everything full quarter impact coming in and so on, so build that. I mean, it will be a little bit of a modelling,"" Singh elaborated.
ZEEL MD & CEO,
Punit Goenka
, also shared that cost rationalisation on the personnel front is now complete, with ongoing natural attrition expected as part of regular business operations.
""Going forward, as any business has churn in employee, we will have those regular churns that happen, but that's part of our day-to-day life,"" he added.
As part of a broader strategy to achieve a 20% EBITDA margin by FY26, ZEEL initiated a 15% workforce reduction, affecting approximately 700 employees out of a total of 4,577.
Additionally, ZEEL has optimised costs by reducing staff in its Technology & Innovation Centre (TIC) by 50%, aiming to enhance its operating profit margin.
This restructuring also led to the departure of senior leaders, including Rahul Johri (head of revenue), Punit Misra (head of content), Shariq Patel (head of movie business), and Atul Das (head of distribution).

Disney Hotstar head Sivanandan said to have resigned after India merger with Reliance,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/disney-hotstar-head-sivanandan-said-to-have-resigned-after-india-merger-with-reliance/articleshow/114537076.cms,24-10-2024,"The head of U.S. giant Disney's Hotstar streaming app in India,
Sajith Sivanandan
, has resigned, three sources said on Thursday, as business integration gathers pace after the company's $8.5 billion merger with
Reliance
's India media assets.
The resignation comes days after an internal decision for all live sporting events of the merged entity, including the popular
Indian Premier League
(IPL), to be streamed on Disney's Hotstar app, and not Reliance's
JioCinema
.
That was the first major step in integration after the deal to create India's biggest entertainment company.
However, the leadership has yet to decide if JioCinema will continue as a separate app, said two of the sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, as the discussions are private.
Sivanandan, Disney and Reliance did not respond to queries from Reuters.
Live Events
After the merger, Disney and Reliance will together have more than 100 TV channels and two streaming apps, and will compete with Sony, Netflix and Amazon Prime.
Sivanandan worked at Hotstar for more than two years after working at Google for 15 years.
JioCinema is currently led by Kiran Mani, another former Google executive who has been associated with Reliance's media unit for about a year.
Reliance's JioCinema has the rights to IPL cricket, a money-spinner that is among the most-streamed content, as well as to the Winter Olympics and Indian Super League football.
Hotstar has rights to the International Cricket Council's tournaments in India and English Premier League soccer.

"Indian entertainment industry loses Rs 22,400 crore annually due to piracy: EY-IAMAI",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/indian-entertainment-industry-lost-rs-22400-cr-to-piracy-in-2023-ey-iamai-report/articleshow/114503950.cms,23-10-2024,"A new report by
EY
and the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) reveals that India’s entertainment industry suffers annual losses of Rs 22,400 crore due to
piracy
, with 51% of consumers accessing pirated content.
The report, titled “The Rob Report,” highlights the growing threat piracy poses to the media and entertainment sector, calling for immediate action to address the issue.
Piracy remains a significant concern, particularly with 62% of consumers believing that stricter enforcement measures are necessary to combat it. The report shows that pirated content from movie theatres contributes Rs 13,700 crore in losses, while
OTT platforms
account for Rs 8,700 crore. In addition, potential
GST losses
amounting to Rs 4,300 crore were estimated.
Streaming services are the most affected, with 63% of pirated content accessed through these platforms. Mobile apps, social media, and torrent sites contribute the remaining share. Despite a 150% increase in subscription revenues post-pandemic, managing multiple subscriptions, unavailability of desired content, and high fees drive users towards piracy.
Rohit Jain, Chairman of IAMAI’s
Digital Entertainment
Committee, said, “The growth potential of India’s digital entertainment sector, projected to reach Rs 14,600 crore by 2026, is severely threatened by piracy. A coordinated effort between government bodies, industry players, and consumers is essential to safeguard this growth.”
Live Events
The report reveals that 64% of those who consume pirated content would switch to legitimate channels, even with ads, if provided for free. Additionally, 84% prefer not to pay for movie tickets, and 70% resist paying for OTT subscriptions, reflecting a strong demand for cost-free entertainment.
Mukul Shrivastava, EY’s Partner and Forensic M&E Leader, emphasised the need for stronger collaboration and technological solutions to combat piracy. “While efforts have been made, they remain fragmented. It is essential for the industry to push for stronger regulations and enforcement while leveraging technology to protect intellectual property.”
The report finds that piracy is most common among individuals aged 19-34, with women more likely to consume OTT shows, and men inclined towards older films. Additionally, 40% of pirated content is in Hindi, followed by 31% in English. Piracy is also more prevalent in Tier II cities due to limited access to authorised content and lower awareness of piracy’s consequences.
Deterrence efforts have largely focused on individual concerns, such as ethical considerations, legal consequences, and fears of malware. However, the report stresses the need for a comprehensive strategy, including large-scale awareness campaigns, better pricing models, and global regulatory enforcement, to effectively combat piracy.

"RIL-Disney to divest seven channels, won't bundle ad slots for cricket",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ril-disney-to-divest-seven-channels-wont-bundle-ad-slots-for-cricket/articleshow/114477523.cms,23-10-2024,"New Delhi/Mumbai:
Reliance Industries
and
Walt Disney
will divest seven TV channels, including Star Jalsha Movies, Colors Marathi, and Hungama, and desist from bundling TV and OTT ad slots for major cricketing events as part of the remedial measures to allay the
antitrust regulator
’s concerns over a $8.5-billion merger of their media assets in the country.
According to the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI’s) detailed order published on Tuesday, the companies will also transfer voting rights in Eenadu Television (ETPL) to its promoters.
Separately, sources told ET the merger between Reliance’s
Viacom18
and Walt Disney's
Star India
is set to be officially concluded early November, with
Nita Ambani
and Uday Shankar serving as chair and vice-chair, respectively, of the merged entity.
The anti-trust regulator had on August 28 approved the merger of Viacom18, Digital18, and Star India that is set to create India’s largest entertainment player, subject to modifications submitted voluntarily by the companies. Tuesday’s 48-page order spelt out the modifications.
The parties, the CCI said, have voluntarily agreed not to bundle TV ad slots for cricketing rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL), the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), for the remaining tenure of the existing rights. They won’t bundle together OTT ad slot sales for these rights as well to mitigate competition concerns in the
advertising
market.

“Additionally, the parties will not bundle together ad slot sales for IPL on TV and IPL on OTT for the balance tenure of the existing rights,” the order said.
Reliance will have a 56% stake and Disney 37% of the combined firm, while Bodhi Tree Systems will have the remaining 7% stake.
""This order gives effect to the commitments made by RIL and Disney to implement certain safeguards and actions, which, in the view of the CCI, would prevent any allegations of abuse of dominance, particularly in relation to sports broadcasting rights. The combined entity will undoubtedly have dominance in various broadcasting segments, especially in sports. It will hold media rights for the IPL, ICC, and BCCI,"" said TMT Law Practice founding partner Abhishek Malhotra.
Pricing Ad Slots
The parties have submitted an undertaking to not raise advertisement rates to an unreasonable level on their TV and streaming platforms for the ICC and IPL events until the existing rights are held by them.
The channels that would be divested as part of the conditions also include Star Jalsha Movies and Star Jalsha Movies HD (operated by Star India in the Bengali film channel sub-segment); Colors Marathi and Colors Marathi HD (operated by Viacom18); and Colors Super (operated by Viacom18 in the Kannada sub-segment.
The move comes as the companies hold over 40% market share in the Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, and kids' content categories.
The parties can’t buy any stake or exercise influence over the divested channels for at least five years.
The merged entity will retain one streaming platform, Disney+ Hotstar, which is also expected to stream the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.
""Most of the formalities for the merger have been finalised, and the combined entity under Star India is set to take effect on November 7,"" said a source, who requested anonymity, adding that the date might move slightly.
The merger, announced on February 28, has been completed in a record eight months, securing approvals from the CCI, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), and the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB).
While the process of putting together the leadership is still work-in-progress, Kevin Vaz and Kiran Mani are slated to serve as co-CEOs, overseeing a workforce of roughly 8,000 employees.
However, the merger may lead to some headcount rationalisation due to redundancies, said sources.
Vaz is expected to lead the entertainment division, while Mani will oversee the sports division.
Union of Intent
As reported by ET, the competition regulator had issued a show-cause notice to Reliance and Walt Disney on August 19, asking why the proposed deal should not be probed over antitrust concerns.
In a reply on August 21, the parties, which had voluntarily offered some modifications to the original deal structure, pledged more steps to allay the regulator's concerns. They had also offered clarifications on their responses on August 27, a day before the regulatory nod for the deal.
Reliance had in May sought CCI clearance for the merger of Viacom18 and Star India Pvt Ltd.
According to Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) data, the combined entities control 45-50% of the Bengali GEC market, 65-70% of the Marathi GEC market, 40-45% of the Kannada GEC market, and 50-55% of the kids' genre. In addition, they dominate the Bengali movie genre with a 55-60% share and have a similar share in the Telugu movie genre.
At a network level, the merged entity holds a 35-40% market share, including 30-35% in the Hindi GEC market. In the streaming segment, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema combined have a 30-35% share of ad and subscription revenues, which remains below the critical 40% market share threshold.
The CCI noted that the channel closures would effectively eliminate overlaps in the Bengali films and Marathi GEC segments, while competition from other networks like Zee would reduce concerns in the Kannada GEC market. In the kids' channel segment, competitors like Warner Bros., Sony, and Sun TV will continue to constrain the merged entity.
Additionally, RIL will assign 24.5% of the voting rights held by TV18 in Eenadu Television Pvt Ltd (ETPL) to the promoters of the company and will retain only limited rights in ETPL. Ushodaya Enterprises, ETPL's parent company, holds a majority stake in the broadcasting company.
Reliance has also committed to transferring 24.5% of TV18’s voting rights to ETPL’s current promoters, who will then have full discretion over these voting rights.

Sonam Kapoor buys Mumbai’s iconic music store for $5.7 million,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/sonam-kapoor-buys-mumbais-iconic-music-store-for-5-7-million/articleshow/114460119.cms,22-10-2024,"Bhaane Group
, owned by celebrity
Sonam Kapoor
and her husband
Anand Ahuja
, is buying
Rhythm House
, an iconic music store in India’s financial capital Mumbai for 478.4 million rupees ($5.7 million).
The 3,600-square foot Rhythm House had been shuttered in 2018 after Nirav Modi, the owner of Firestar Diamond International Pvt that ran the music store, defaulted on billions of dollars of bank loans. A resolution professional appointed by the Indian bankruptcy court oversaw the sale of the store confirmed the value of the deal to Bloomberg News in a telephone interview.
“The stakeholder committee has approved the sale of Rhythm House for 478.4 million rupees,” said Shantanu T Ray, the official liquidator overseeing the sale of Firestar’s assets.
A spokesperson for Bhaane, which manufactures various clothes under its own label, confirmed the purchase, but declined to share the value of the deal. The company is an arm of Shahi Exports Pvt, owned by Anand’s father Harish Ahuja and is one of the largest apparel makers in India which supplies international brands including Uniqlo, Decathlon and H&M.
“We have completed our due diligence and plan to expand our retail presence in the city. As private companies, we are unable to comment on any financial information regarding the bid,” a spokesperson for the Bhaane said in an email statement. Bhaane’s retail unit operates the chain of Nike and Converse stores in India.

The deal signals the end of an era for a generation of music lovers who grew up listening to their favorite artistes on vinyls, cassettes and compact discs.
Established in the 1940s, Rhythm House had once hosted legendary musicians like classical artist Pandit Ravi Shankar, Jethro Tull’s Ian Anderson and a bevy of Bollywood stars. But beginning in the late 90s, a rising wave of music piracy first and later the advent of digital streaming steadily made the landmark store irrelevant for music aficionados.

"Zomato helps Paytm make lemonade out of lemons, at least for a while",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/paytm-q2-earnings-profit-share-price-despite-expectations-of-widening-losses-thanks-to-zomatos-tickets-business/articleshow/114451715.cms,22-10-2024,"Troubled fintech
Paytm
has beat expectations or at least managed to do so for now, thanks to
Zomato
.
One97 Communications
, which operates fintech and digital payments major
Paytm
was expected to clock higher revenue growth but the losses were expected to widen in Q2.
Losses for the July-September 2024 period were likely to widen up to Rs 660 crore from Rs 290 crore in the same period of last year. However, beating expectations in the second quarter of FY 2025, Paytm posted a profit of Rs 930 crore, largely fueled by a one-time exceptional gain of Rs 1,345 crore from selling its
entertainment ticketing
business to
Zomato
.
Paytm shares were trading at Rs 685.15, down 5.62 per cent as of 12.25 PM on Tuesday.
The deal, finalized on August 27, 2024, led to a dip in Paytm’s marketing services revenue, which fell to Rs 302 crore, down from previous quarters. However, excluding the ticketing business, revenue stood at Rs 268 crore. The company’s
credit card distribution
scaled significantly, with 13.8 lakh activated credit cards, while travel services continued to show strong momentum.
Live Events
The deal was a result of Paytm's aim to focus on the payments and financial services distribution segment and was valued at Rs 2,048 crore.
During a transition period (up to 12 months), the movie and event tickets will continue to be available on the Paytm app, as well as on the TicketNew and Insider platforms, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted experience for users and merchant partners.
As part of the deal, about 280 existing employees from the entertainment ticketing business will move to Zomato.

Adar Poonawalla
, CEO of the
Serum Institute
of India, is picking up a 50% stake in
Dharma Production
and Dharmatic Entertainment, for Rs 1000 crore, valuing
Karan Johar
’s film and television production and distribution flagship at Rs 2000 crore, further underpinning the ongoing flurry of consolidation in the entertainment industry.
ET broke the story online on Monday morning, ahead of a formal announcement.
Poonawalla’s is making this investment in his private capacity through Serene Productions. Dharma will retain the residual stake with Johar continuing to remain as the creative spearhead of the company, as Executive Chairman. Apoorva Mehta remains the Chief Executive Officer.
Dharma is owned 90.7% by Karan Johar and 9.24% by his mother, Hiroo.
“I do foresee consolidation in this industry. Internationally, we've seen a lot of consolidation due to new content creation methods and distribution channels,” Poonawalla told ET. “With the evolving landscape of content production and distribution, I see significant potential for such partnerships both internationally and nationally.”
Live Events
The key factor that led to stitching together this alliance is Johar retaining creative control while partnering with a deep pocket family he is familiar with. The Poonawalla investment will help the production house with enough financial muscle to navigate the fast-changing demands of digitally savvy consumers who are often digital natives. The investment will also boost Dharma’s efforts to double down on content for new platforms and formats while continuing to deliver interesting stories for a global audience.
“This partnership will help us create more verticals within the organization and allow us to take creative chances. This gives us the bandwidth to expand Dharmatic Entertainment and create much more in the digital domain,” added Johar. “It also allows us to capture a lot of value in the value chain which comes with owning IP and catalogue – we have already been doing that and hope to double down on it with this capital.”
ET Bureau
Film production is a volatile business with earnings linked to box office successes of films. Major Hindi film production houses, including Dharma, have been cautious in greenlighting new projects due to the unpredictable nature of the box office, which also impacts the value of streaming and satellite rights, ET had reported on October 14.
Johar said, the company’s attempts will be to increase the value and create more content. “We aim to produce a higher volume of films with this partnership compared to what we're currently doing. With shrinking audiences and an overreliance on streaming rights, Johar feels a strategic business shift is already underway. “Mid-budget films are the backbone of the film industry's economics, and we need to explore this segment further, alongside our tentpole productions, to create a more diverse and sustainable portfolio of films,” he said.
CHANGING DYNAMICS
The industry is experiencing major upheavals due to shifting consumer preferences, influenced by exposure to global content and the increasing dominance of on-demand consumption in urban areas. Additionally, the economic model is strained, with star salaries often consuming up to 70% of a film’s budget. Consolidation on the demand side, with the emergence of large broadcasters, streaming platforms, and multiplexes, is also putting pressure on content companies like Dharma. Satellite rights, once a steady revenue stream, have plummeted to historic lows, and the value of streaming deals, which was funding movie costs in many cases, is being corrected, further straining the economics of the film business.
In the theatrical space, multiplexes now dictate a film’s success, contributing an estimated 60–70% of Hindi films' box office revenue, while single-screen theaters continue to struggle. Post-COVID, many viewers prefer to wait 8–10 weeks to watch films on OTT platforms, leading to reduced footfall in cinemas.
Some industry players are already contemplating profit share model or box office linked payouts to offset rising star costs. “It's essential not to overload our above-the-line costs. While we respect actors' talent and craft and want to pay what's fair, all artists must understand the current challenges in the entertainment industry. There's enough potential in big films for everyone to gain,” said Johar.
Dharma has been actively seeking investments for a while and had engaged in talks with several large conglomerates and industrialists like Sanjiv Goenka’s Saregama, a company they already have business ties to become part of a cash-rich conglomerate. Some discussions with Reliance Industries and Jio Cinema also did take place.
Raine Group was the advisor to the deal.
Dharma Productions posted a nearly fourfold surge in revenue to Rs 1,040 crore in FY23, from Rs 276 crore the previous year. Net profit, however, fell 59% to Rs 11 crore due to a 4.5-times rise in expenses at Rs 1,028 crore, according to the company's latest available financial data accessed from Tofler. In FY23, the company earned Rs 656 crore from distribution rights, Rs 140 crore from digital, Rs 83 crore from satellite rights, and Rs 75 crore from music. This compares with earnings of with earnings of Rs 19 crore, Rs 167 crore, Rs 34 crore, and Rs 21 crore from these streams, respectively, in FY22.
HITS & FLOPS
Founded by Johar’s father Yash Johar in 1976, with its first venture starring Amitabh Bachchan in a film called Dostana, Dharma has been led by Johar and his team since his father passed away. Johar directed his first movie at 25 ‘Kuch Kuch Hota Hai’, and has gone on to produce close to 50 Bollywood including hits like 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, 2 States, Kapoor & Sons and Dear Zindagi’. Seen as a launch pad for several young actors, many from well-known film families like Allia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Janhvi Kapoor, Ishaan Khatter and Ananya Pandey among others. In 2018, the company launched Dharmatic Entertainment to diversify and create original content for global streaming platforms and has worked with global OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime to create and produce shows like “The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives”, “Call Me Bae”. From blockbuster films Johar was also among the first of his peers to migrate to multi-media himself, becoming a chat show host for the popular Koffee with Karan show.

Reliance to retain Disney+ Hotstar as sole streaming platform for merged entity,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/reliance-to-retain-disney-hotstar-as-sole-streaming-platform-for-merged-entity/articleshow/114350187.cms,19-10-2024,"Reliance Industries Ltd
(RIL) will retain Disney+ Hotstar as the sole streaming platform after the merger of
Star India
and
Viacom18
, people aware of the matter told ET.
The reshuffle exercise will see Disney+ Hotstar absorbing JioCinema, positioning the former as the primary streaming platform for the combined entity. With the Star-Viacom18 merger in its final stages, RIL aims to stream the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 on Disney+ Hotstar.
Initially, RIL explored various strategies for the proposed merged entity’s streaming business. At one point, the company considered integrating Disney+ Hotstar into JioCinema, or operating two separate platforms—one for sports and another for entertainment.
""Reliance’s leadership ultimately chose Disney+ Hotstar for its superior tech infrastructure,"" said a person familiar with the discussions.
Live Events
Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema employees were informed of the decision earlier this week. RIL declined to comment on the development.
Both platforms have a robust content library, boasting over 200,000 hours of content, including premium broadcast content from Star and Viacom18’s channels. They also lead in live sports streaming, offering the IPL, ICC, BCCI, and Premier League, alongside Hollywood content from Disney, HBO, NBC Universal, and Paramount Global.
In August, ET first reported that RIL was inclined to consolidate JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar into a single OTT platform, although the conglomerate initially favoured JioCinema, which gained significant traction after streaming the FIFA World Cup 2022 for free.
In February, RIL and Walt Disney signed an $8.5 billion deal to merge Star and Viacom18, creating a media powerhouse with over 100 channels and two streaming platforms. The merger has received approval from the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal, and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
Star India will be the operating company of the merged entity, with Viacom18 transferring all its TV and streaming assets to Star. RIL will control Star with a 56% stake while Walt Disney will hold 37%, and Uday Shankar and James Murdoch’s Bodhi Tree Systems will have 7%. Nita Ambani will serve as chairperson, while Shankar will take on the role of vice-chair.
According to RIL's annual report, JioCinema reached an average of 225 million monthly users, while Disney+ Hotstar had 333 million monthly active users in Q4 2023. Disney+ Hotstar had 35.5 million paid subscribers as of June, while JioCinema, as of September, became the fastest-growing subscription-based OTT platform with over 16 million paid subscribers.
Previously, Viacom18 consolidated its various OTT platforms under the Voot brand into JioCinema, merging Voot, Voot Select, and Voot Kids into a single platform.

Kalra noted that nearly 40% of ZEE5's subscriptions come from cities outside the top 20, with regional content accounting for more than 50% of the platform's total watch time. This shift towards regional content has been a key factor in expanding their audience base.
On the technology front, ZEE5 has made significant advancements to enhance the user experience. The technology team in Bengaluru has been focusing on refining the recommendation engine and utilising machine learning to deliver more accurate results.
Drawing from its roots in producing family-oriented television content, ZEE5 is adopting a similar approach while ensuring that storytelling and creativity remain uncompromised.
""In the past 12 months, our content has featured very little profanity and no intimate scenes. Indian consumers enjoy good plots, complex characters, and layered stories. However, they want content that can be enjoyed with family, as India remains largely a single-TV household,"" Kalra explained.
In terms of original movie production, ZEE5 is focused on creating content that delivers a strong return on investment. Kalra mentioned this includes negotiating better deals with production houses and effectively managing actor fees.
Kalra also pointed to emerging trends in the OTT industry, such as Connected TV (CTV) and 4K streaming. He noted that while there are 35 million CTV households in the country, only 25 million are internet-connected.
He shared that 75% of ZEE5's paid subscribers prefer watching content on CTVs, while 82% of free content consumption occurs on mobile. Additionally, 20% of ZEE5's users stream content in 4K, and nearly 80% of the platform's content library is available in 4K.

Reliance Jio opens up JioTV+ access to multiple TVs without additional STB,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/reliance-jio-opens-up-jiotv-access-to-multiple-tvs-without-additional-stb/articleshow/114291153.cms,16-10-2024,"Reliance Jio
has extended its JioTV+ over-the-top (OTT) aggregation service to support a wider range of
smart TVs
, which will allow existing
JioFiber
and
Jio AirFiber
customers to access the service on multiple TVs without the need for an additional
Set-Top Box
(STB).
Existing JioFiber or JioAirFiber users can download the JioTV+ app on smart TVs, allowing them to access the service across multiple smart TVs in the home with just one Jio connection. Both JioFiber and JioAirFiber come with IPTV STBs.
Experts believe this move will help broaden the reach of JioTV+, which provides a unified platform for discovering and streaming content from multiple
OTT services
through a single interface, previously available only on the Jio STB.
""When it comes to the in-home experience itself, now we have a great product called Jio TV+, which was a unified experience to discover all of the OTT services that are available, especially on the Jio STB, so that from a single interface, users can discover and consume all their favourite shows and movies and so on, without having to search and jump across multiple apps and so on,"" Kiran Thomas, President, Reliance Jio Infocomm, said during the company's Q2 earnings call.
""So, this particular service, which was till now on the Jio STB and a very well-loved offering, we have now also enabled that to be available on other smart TV platforms. So, what that means is that if you are a JioFiber or Jio AirFiber customer, then the same Jio TV+ application that is available on the STB is now also available for additional televisions that you may have in your home without requiring an additional STB or an additional connection. So, it just becomes an additional app that you can download on your smart TV without having to take additional efforts to enable that to happen,"" he added.
Live Events
In Q2, the JioTV+ app was made available for free download on all leading smart TVs without additional JioAirFiber/JioFiber connection. This JioTV+ 2-in-1 offer allows users to connect multiple TVs with one connection and access 800+
digital TV channels
and 13+ OTT apps.
Karan Taurani, Senior Vice President at Elara Capital, remarked that JioTV+ is poised for a significant boost in its user base with this move. He highlighted Jio's vast
content offerings
, which not only include its own in-house productions but also partnerships with major players like Sony and Zee, offering a rich ""app-in-app"" experience.

Prime Video to launch ad-free subscription tier at higher price in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/prime-video-to-launch-ad-free-subscription-tier-at-higher-price-in-india/articleshow/114276920.cms,16-10-2024,"Amazon
Prime Video
is set to introduce
advertisements
during its shows and films for Indian users beginning in 2025. For viewers who prefer an ad-free experience,
Amazon
will roll out a new premium subscription tier at a higher price.
However, the current Prime membership fee will remain unchanged for those opting for the ad-supported version. Prime Lite subscribers will continue to see ads as part of their existing plan, with more information to be shared closer to the launch date.
The decision reflects the pressure on the subscription video on demand (SVOD) segment, which has stagnated in recent times.
The Indian
OTT audience
universe has grown 14% year on year to 547.3 million users, translating to a penetration of 38.4%, as per The Ormax OTT Audience Report: 2024, which is based on a sample size of 12,000 across urban and rural India.
The growth in the universe is entirely driven by the advertising video on demand (AVOD) audience, which grew by 21%, while the
SVOD segment
witnessed a degrowth of 2%, the report added.
Live Events
“To continue investing in engaging content and increasing that investment long-term, starting in 2025, Prime Video shows and films in India will feature limited advertisements. We plan to offer significantly fewer ads than what is seen on linear television and other streaming platforms. Additionally, we’ll introduce a new ad-free option and share pricing details later,” Amazon stated in a blog post.
“We won’t be changing the current Prime membership fees in 2025. Members will be notified via email several weeks before ads appear, with instructions on how to sign up for the ad-free option if they wish. This update does not affect Prime Lite subscribers, who will continue to enjoy the full Prime Video library with ads on a single device (TV or mobile) in 720p HD,” the post continued.
Since its launch in India in December 2016, Prime Video has become a leading entertainment platform, offering a vast library of Indian and international films, popular shows, award-winning Amazon Originals, add-on subscriptions, and film rentals—all in one convenient location.
In addition to its SVOD platform, Prime Video, Amazon also owns Amazon MX Player, an AVOD service, and Prime Video Channels, an OTT aggregation service, as well as a film rental service.
Amazon Prime Video introduced ads for its streaming service in the US and other countries starting in early 2024. It also offers an ad-supported tier alongside its existing
ad-free subscription
model, which remains available for an additional fee.

, a leading digital entertainment and technology company, has forayed into
Hollywood
, with two of its senior executives acting as executive producers on '
Please Don’t Feed the Children
', the directorial debut of
Destry Allyn Spielberg
, daughter of renowned filmmaker
Steven Spielberg
.
Rajan Navani
, Founder and CEO of JetSynthesys, alongside
Medha Jaishankar
, Head of JetSynthesys Los Angeles, serve as executive producers on the
post-apocalyptic thriller
, marking a major step forward for the company as it ventures into the Hollywood landscape. This project exemplifies JetSynthesys’ aim to connect Eastern and Western storytelling, pushing creative boundaries in global cinema.
'Please Don’t Feed the Children' made a strong impact at its world premiere at the prestigious Sitges Film Festival, renowned for showcasing cutting-edge genre films. Set in a dystopian world decimated by a mysterious disease, the film follows a group of orphans as they battle to survive.
The cast includes three-time Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Michelle Dockery ('Downton Abbey') and Emmy-nominated Giancarlo Esposito ('Breaking Bad', 'The Mandalorian'). Spielberg’s directorial debut is poised to merge high-stakes tension with deeply emotional narratives, offering a fresh take on the horror genre.
“Being involved with 'Please Don’t Feed the Children' as an executive producer is a landmark achievement for JetSynthesys and for me personally,” said Rajan Navani, Founder and CEO of JetSynthesys. “This project aligns perfectly with our vision of supporting bold and innovative storytelling that transcends borders. Working alongside Destry Allyn Spielberg has been a rewarding experience, and her fresh approach to the genre illustrates the importance of fostering new talent. We’re eager to continue exploring stories that resonate globally, and we look forward to future collaborations that strengthen the bond between Eastern and Western cinema.”

Medha Jaishankar, Head of JetSynthesys Los Angeles, added, “Please Don’t Feed the Children signifies an exciting new chapter for JetSynthesys as we step into Hollywood’s dynamic creative arena. Our involvement reflects our dedication to cross-cultural collaboration and genre-defining storytelling. Supporting Destry’s directorial vision has been a truly inspiring experience, and we are thrilled to present this powerful film to audiences around the world, highlighting the emotional depth and creative possibilities within the horror genre.”
JetSynthesys’ participation in 'Please Don’t Feed the Children' reinforces its strategy to establish itself as a key player in the global entertainment industry. This venture not only affirms the company’s commitment to fostering innovative storytelling but also highlights its focus on nurturing the next generation of filmmakers who will shape the future of cinema.

Cinema owners feel the heat ahead of big Diwali releases,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/cinema-owners-feel-the-heat-ahead-of-big-diwali-releases/articleshow/114158248.cms,12-10-2024,"Singham Again
and
Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3
have fired up the Hindi-language film industry ahead of their Diwali release. But even as the response to the trailers of the two mega productions portends fireworks at the box-office, with some estimates suggesting potential collection of around Rs 1,000 crore,
cinema owners
are facing intense pressure from distributors for more shows and screens for the respective films, said industry executives.
Cinema owners in not just metros but also tier-2 and tier-3 cities across the country find themselves in a bind over the competing big-budget films, they said.
“Single-screen theatre owners are facing a tough dilemma when it comes to allocating shows between these two films,” said Anil Bohra, owner of City Light, a single-screen theatre in Palanpur, Gujarat. He added that the potential for these films to generate strong box-office business could be diminished due to their release on the same day.
Echoing concern, Brijesh Tandon, a film exhibitor from the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh regions, said, “Both films look promising and could be big money-spinners. However, I believe the clash could have been avoided. Releasing them separately would have been better, as business will inevitably get divided with both films competing on the same day.” According to the 2024 FICCI-EY media and entertainment report, India has a total of 9,742 cinema screens. Trade analysts estimate that 25-26% of these are multiplex screens, while the majority are single screens.

Singham Again is being distributed by
PVR Inox
Pictures.
PVR Inox is the distribution arm of multiplex firm PVR Inox, which operates 1,747 screens across the country.
Meanwhile, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is being distributed by
AA Films
, owned by Anil Thadani, one of the most successful pan-India distributors. “Multiplexes with at least five screens can easily allocate sufficient space and showtimes to both films. Distributors of these two films are unlikely to suffer significant losses in multiplexes,” said a person, who did not wish to be identified. “Single-screen cinema owners, however, will face intense pressure from distributors of both films.”
Independent film distributor and trade analyst Shaaminder Malik said, “Exhibitors cannot afford to upset distributors of both films. If Singham Again has big stars and a big studio attached to it, then one cannot underestimate Anil Thadani, who is distributing Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3. He has a long-established record, brand name and quite a standing in the industry.”
He added that exhibitors are aware that these distributors and studios can distribute and produce around a dozen films a year. Nitin Datar, president of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India, said he was optimistic despite the tension between the exhibitors and distributors. “Single-screen owners will certainly feel significant pressure from distributors,” he said. “However, this will likely be a weekend issue. By Monday, November 4, after Diwali, it will be clear which film gets more shows and screens, as the audience’s verdict will be reflected in the
box-office collections
.”
Trade analysts said the running time of the two films — Singham Again (about three hours) and Bhool Bhulaiya 3 (around two hours and 40 minutes) — would also play a role in how many shows and screens they get. However, expectations from both films are high, they said, as these films don’t face competition from another big-budget production for at least a month.

Beyond its own library, Discovery+ hosts content from A+E Networks, the BBC, and Indian infotainment channel Epic TV. WBD’s factual entertainment channels collectively reach 120 million viewers monthly.
Abishek stressed that WBD is not only expanding its content offerings but also backing each release with robust marketing campaigns, especially for its original IPs.
In 2022, Discovery Communications India adopted a new corporate identity as Warner Bros. Discovery India. The company also distributes channels from its fellow subsidiary, WarnerMedia India.
Looking ahead, Discovery+ plans to debut several major titles, including Chris Brown: A History of Violence and Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking, alongside popular BBC productions like Dynasties Series 2 and Frozen Planet II.
Discovery Channel
will premiere five new series, including Jesus: Refugee, Renegade, Redeemer with
Bear Grylls
and Expedition Unknown Series 9 with Josh Gates. The Naked & Afraid franchise will return with Naked & Afraid XL Series 9 and Naked & Afraid: Last One Standing Series 2. Additionally, local originals such as Star vs. Food Survival will be featured.
Animal Planet is set to introduce over 100 hours of new programming, focusing on predatory content and anthologies like Deadly Strike and Snake Dynasty. The year-end will also feature the special 50 Days: 50 Tales.
TLC, WBD’s lifestyle channel, will release over 100 hours of new shows, including festive specials for Halloween, Diwali, and Christmas, as well as new series such as 100 Day Dream Home Series 2 & 3 and Forbidden Love.
In the past five years, WBD has ramped up
local productions
with successful shows like Into the Wild with Bear Grylls and Akshay Kumar and the investigative series My Daughter Joined a Cult season 1, centred around Swami Nithyananda.
The network has covered a broad range of genres, including history and mythology with series like Legends of the Ramayana with Amish, as well as true crime and survival-themed shows, Abishek said.
The first flagship show under the India Originals line-up on discovery+ and Discovery Channel was Secrets of the Buddha Relics, hosted by Manoj Bajpayee and created by Neeraj Pandey. The roster also included Reality Ranis of the Jungle, a series that follows twelve reality stars.

"HC seeks Centre, Delhi govt response after PIL cites illegal bump in concert ticket prices",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/hc-seeks-centre-delhi-govt-response-after-pil-cites-illegal-bump-in-concert-ticket-prices/articleshow/114093054.cms,09-10-2024,"The
Delhi High Court
on Thursday sought responses from the Centre and Delhi government on a
public interest litigation
(PIL) alleging ""illegal, manipulative and exploitive"" practice of
ticket scalping
, wherein event tickets are resold to people at inflated prices. A bench of Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela issued notices to the Union ministries of Electronics and Information Technology, Information and Broadcasting and Finance and Delhi government's Department of Trade and Taxes on the petition.
The petitioner,
Rohan Gupta
, referred to upcoming music concerts by British rock band Coldplay and singers Diljit Dosanjh and Karan Aujla.
The court also issued notices to several private companies engaged in the ticketing business and listed the matter for further hearing on February 18.
The plea argued that the malpractice of ticket scalping distorts the fairness of the ticket-buying process and undermines the fan experience by creating an environment where only those willing to pay exorbitant amounts can attend events.
The PIL said scalping fosters a black market where fraudulent and counterfeit tickets become more prevalent, further exploiting consumers and sought a direction to the authorities to frame clear guidelines to prevent predatory re-sellers from illegally engaging in activity of black marketing of tickets.
Live Events
The plea further sought a direction for constitution of a committee to look into the issue alleging the same happened during the bookings of ""Dil-Luminati Tour"" of Dosanjh scheduled to take place on October 26 at the JLN Stadium in the national capital.
During the hearing, Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi submitted that the issue is already covered under Section 112 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).
He said when the practice of illegal sale of tickets being a criminal offence is already covered under the penal code, guidelines cannot be issued over and above what is described as an offence.
Section 112 of the BNS deals with petty organised crime and the punishment for such crimes.
It defines petty organised crime as any illegal act committed by a member of a group or gang, either alone or jointly. These acts include theft, cheating, snatching, illegal sale of tickets and selling public examination question papers.
The plea, filed through advocates Jatin Yadav, Gaurav Dua and Saurabh Dua, further argued that scalping transactions occurring through unregulated channels contributed to the growth of a shadow economy, depriving the state of funds that could otherwise support public services, infrastructure, or community development.

Broadcasters may move TDSAT against Trai’s new tariff regulation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/broadcasters-may-move-tdsat-against-trais-new-tariff-regulation/articleshow/114048194.cms,08-10-2024,"Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation
(
IBDF
) is likely to move the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) against recent
broadcast tariff regulation
amendments after the
Kerala High Court
dismissed its petition saying
TDSAT
is the appropriate forum to consider it.
The disputed regulation requires broadcasters to provide free channels on
DD Free Dish
to private distribution platform operators (DPOs).
The broadcasters’ body, in its petition challenging the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (
Trai
) July 8 tariff regulation, argued that DD Free Dish cannot be equated with other DPOs as it does not charge subscriptions from consumers whereas private DPOs collect subscription charges from their subscribers.
The HC had directed Trai not to take coercive action against the broadcasters for non-publication of reference interconnect offer (RIO) based on the amended regulation.
Subsequently, All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF) and direct-to-home (DTH) operators Tata Play,
Dish TV
, Airtel Digital TV, Sun Direct and Prasar Bharati had filed impleadment applications before the HC to join the case.
Live Events
In the petition filed on August 14, IBDF also stated that Trai’s onerous conditions will lead to a drop in the reach of channels as broadcasters will either have to pull out their channels from DD Free Dish or make them FTA to other DPOs and be outside the pay channel bouquets.
DPOs have long complained to the regulator that the broadcasters are discriminating against them by charging them for the same channels that are available on FTA basis on DD Free Dish. Over 15
pay channels
across multiple genres are present on DD Free Dish.
Trai and DPOs have argued that the tariff regulation has been applied to TV broadcasters and not to DD Free Dish. The DPOs have in the past contended that DD Free Dish operates as a commercial platform, with the only notable difference being that it does not charge any subscription fee.

#Concerts trending in I-T dept: Glare on event managers; 11 cos get notices for underreporting of income,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/concerts-trending-in-i-t-dept-glare-on-event-managers-11-cos-get-notices-for-underreporting-of-income/articleshow/114023299.cms,08-10-2024,"The Income Tax (I-T) Department is investigating over a dozen
event management companies
suspected of evasion through underreporting and incorrect declaration of income from overseas performances, as well as cash payments to vendors and contractors beyond the prescribed limit to escape the tax net, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Celebrities who have worked with these companies are also under scrutiny as the tax department has detected discrepancies in fees and payments, ET has learnt. These pertain to those organising musical events, high-profile weddings, ticketed stand-up comedy shows and overseas performances of artistes.
“There is rampant underreporting of income by event management companies. We are closely monitoring the income declared by them, along with the actual payment made and expenditure by companies,” a senior official told ET.
Authorities have been investigating
tax evasion
by event organisers since December 2023 and have conducted searches and sent notices to 11 companies so far. The companies are said to have managed events that cost more than ₹40 crore each. The department has been expanding the scope of investigation, bringing more companies into the ambit and may soon send notices to them as well. “There will be more follow-up questioning,” the official said.

‘Long Chain of Evasion’
The official refused to divulge names as investigations are underway and popular figures are allegedly involved.
In many cases, the event management companies are also not deducting tax at source (TDS) for payments to contractors and some artistes. Under the
Income Tax Act
, 1961, any payment made to an event management company for services rendered is subject to
TDS
under Sections 194C or 194J.
Event management companies must deduct TDS from payments made to contractors, vendors, or freelancers, and remit it.
One official cited an instance: A singer at a wedding in Goa declared a fee of Rs 3.5 crore, while the event management company declared a payment of Rs 9 crore to the performer. The couple who hired the company declared a payment of Rs 9 crore for the entire event. The
Income Tax Department
has sent notices to all three parties.
“This is just one example of discrepancies in payment. There is a long chain of evasion on all levels — from organisers to vendors,” said the official, adding that a large portion of payments is being made in cash, which escapes the tax net.
The official added that many of these companies don’t have goods and services tax (GST) registration and
GST officials
are looking separately into the matter. All companies, including event managers, that engage in the supply of goods or services with an annual turnover exceeding Rs 40 lakh are required to register for GST.

Bharti Airtel in advanced talks to acquire Tata Play to boost digital TV segment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bharti-airtel-in-advanced-talks-to-acquire-tata-play-to-boost-digital-tv-segment/articleshow/114022478.cms,08-10-2024,"Sunil Mittal-led
Bharti Airtel
is in advanced negotiations with the
Tata Group
to buy loss-making
Tata Play
, India’s largest direct-to-home (DTH) business, said people aware of the matter. The aim is to consolidate its presence in the
digital TV
segment that’s facing growth challenges while improving Airtel’s bundled offerings to shore up its non-mobile revenues through convergence.
If a sale happens, it will mark Tata’s departure from its sub-scale content and entertainment operations. It will also be the second time that the two business groups strike a deal, after Bharti bought out Tata’s bleeding and leveraged consumer mobility business in 2017 and absorbed it two years later. That was
Tata Sons
’ chairman N Chandrasekaran’s first divestment after taking charge of the group holding company.
Tier 1 and tier 2 users are upgrading to over-the-top (OTT) packs on home broadband instead of DTH and cutting the cord to migrate to cheaper online alternatives while rural subscribers are increasingly opting for Doordarshan’s Free Dish.
The talks, ongoing for weeks, have gathered momentum and a formal announcement is expected soon, said the people cited above. Tata Sons did not comment.
“The group had bet on the growth of Tata Play and seen strategic value in it until the dynamics of the market changed,” said an executive close to the development. “The group has been clear that in any market, it has to be in a position of strength and scale. That did not seem to happen as hoped with Tata Play. On the other hand, Tata Play fits well in the strategic plans of Airtel and its portfolio of offerings to consumers.”

Mails to Airtel remained unanswered till press time Monday.
Tata Sons, the holding company of the diversified conglomerate, currently owns 70% of the company, after having bought out Singapore investment firm Temasek Holding Pte’s 10% stake in April for ₹835 crore ($100 million), valuing the company at $1 billion, down a third from its $3 billion pre-pandemic valuation.
Walt Disney owns 30% of Tata Play but has been looking to exit the TV distribution business after pruning its portfolio and merging its media operations with Reliance Jio in India. Disney inherited Sky’s legacy stake in Tata Play, after its 2019 mega-merger with Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. Prior to buying out Temasek, Tata had also acquired Tata Opportunities Fund’s minority stake in the venture.
Airtel is expected to buy Tata Play at a valuation similar to that of the Temasek deal, said the people cited above. The plan had been to consolidate the Tata stakes and list the company, with IPO documents being filed in 2022. However, Tata put the listing plan exercise on hold in August.
TUNING IN
Tata Sky, which began content distribution in 2006, five years after getting incorporated, has 20.77 million subscribers, according to March Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) data, translating to a 32.7% market share. Bharti Telemedia, which offers Airtel Digital TV, is second with a market share of 27.8%. The business has been adding subscribers for the last three consecutive quarters, the management disclosed when announcing Airtel’s June quarter results. Net additions in the quarter amounted to 190,000, bucking the trend.
Cash-strapped
Dish TV
, with 20.8% market share, and Sun TV Direct with 18.7% share are the other two players. Tata Play Broadband, which provides service under the Tata Play Fibre brand, has 480,000 subscribers.
Airtel DTH is predominantly focused in three key pockets—the south, Maharashtra and West Bengal.
Analysts said the move, if successful, will help Airtel take on Jio’s aggressive offerings, while offsetting the vulnerability associated with a standalone player like Tata Play. “The whole strategy for telcos has been to enter one’s home and start offering bundled services, wireless or fibre broadband, DTH, internet of things. Once you have locked in a family, you can even offer content for free,” said an analyst. “Jio has strengthened its content play after the Disney (Star) deal and already has distribution. Now Airtel too gets a customer base and access to a premium set of subscribers.”
The key will be valuation, he said. With DTH in the doldrums globally, Airtel should get a discount. “Tata Play’s efforts to ramp up its broadband offerings have also been muted,” he said. “It needs huge capital commitments.”
The company’s consolidated net loss widened to ₹353.8 crore in FY24 from ₹105.25 crore the previous year, according to Registrar of Companies filings. The standalone
DTH business
also slipped into the red, with a loss of ₹247 crore against a net profit of ₹20 crore in FY23. Revenue from the DTH segment dropped 6.1% to ₹3,982.57 crore from ₹4,240.04 crore in FY23.
In comparison, Airtel Digital TV’s net loss narrowed to ₹76 crore in FY24 from ₹349 crore, with revenue rising slightly to ₹3,045 crore from ₹2,949 crore.
“In the DTH business, the company simplified content choices for customers to choose from just three plans, which drove outperformance versus industry with healthy net customer additions,” said Balaji Subramanian of IIFL Securities.
READING THE SIGNALS
Talks of an inevitable consolidation in the pay TV industry intensified after the merger of Disney’s Star and Reliance-owned Viacom18, which will give the new entity significant bargaining power with both operators and advertisers.
A major obstacle to M&As in the DTH industry has been the pending licence fees that DTH operators owe. The matter is in the Supreme Court, but all operators are making provisions for payments. Bharti Telemedia, as per its regulatory filings, potentially faces a liability of Rs 5,580 crore related to disputed licence fees, with provisions of Rs 3,426 crore as of March 31, though the company does not expect having to make an immediate payout. Similarly, Tata Play has received demand notices totalling Rs 3,628 crore, including Rs 1,401.66 crore in interest. This will also potentially influence the final valuation figure.
Another operational roadblock arises out of the different satellites used by operators. For instance, Airtel uses the SES satellite, while Tata Play uses GSAT. Switching between these is expensive and can lead to customer churn, making it harder to realise cost synergies. Dish TV, which merged with Videocon d2h, faced this issue when both services continued using different satellites.

Bollywood actors coming down from sky-high fee to get movies rolling,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/stars-coming-down-from-sky-high-fee-to-get-movies-rolling/articleshow/113992791.cms,07-10-2024,"A-list actors, known for their box office appeal, are stepping back and adopting a more realistic approach by lowering their fees on a project-by-project basis to help get films off the ground in today’s challenging funding environment and amid a string of high-profile failures, according to several film producers.
Several top names have cut their rates by up to 30% compared to what they charged during the pandemic, a sign of the times and a necessary move to keep the industry moving forward.
Generally speaking, an A-list actor's remuneration forms more than 50% of the cost of production of a film.
Girish Johar, a producer known for Hindi films like
Jazbaa
(2015),
Rustom
(2016), and
Tadka
(2022), said, ""Today, there is a clear focus on the cost of films. Many A-list actors have become more realistic and are reducing their fees by up to 30% on a project-to-project basis. This way, at least films are getting started.”

Stars' remaining fees come from profit--money generated after a film breaks even
5
Producers raises 45-50% funds for cost of production (95% of crew on board)
6
Studios or OTTs provide funds (lower than post release buying) for cost of production
*An estimate of a big budget film. May differ from project to project
In addition to reducing their remuneration, some A-list actors are now agreeing to take 20-30% of their fees upfront and the remaining 60-70% from the film’s profits, say industry experts.
The failure of top films like
Bade Miyan Chote Miyan
,
Maidaan
and
Fighter
has also forced production houses to look closely at costs and their film slates.
A founder and Group CEO of a leading talent management agency, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, ""The number of films each production house is making has decreased. The mantra now is to create fewer, bigger, and better films.”
He added, “Increasingly, the industry is following skin-in-the-game strategy in order to kick-start films. A-list actors who have reduced their fees take a basic fee and they secure a large part of their remuneration from the profits of a film.”
Producers noted that this approach, where A-list actors take a smaller upfront fee, eases the burden of raising funds for films and creates a win-win situation for all stakeholders.
Sunir Kheterpal, a film producer at Athena E&M, known for films like
Badla
(2019),
Kesari
(2019), and
Dobaaraa
(2022), said, ""The current business ecosystem has made a collaborative commercial structure necessary, where talent comes in at a fixed cost but shares in the upside when a film succeeds at the box office."" He added that this more cooperative approach between key stakeholders—financiers, studios, talent, and producers—is an organic response to the industry's current state of affairs.
Given that star fees account for a significant portion of the costs, when an A-list actor reduces their fee and accepts only a basic amount, the producer then faces the task of raising funds solely for the production costs, which are considerably lower than the actor’s typical fee.
Suniel Wadhwa, co-founder of Karmic Films and a veteran film distributor known for titles like
Three of Us
(2022),
All India Rank
(2023), and
Lal Salaam
(Hindi, 2024), said, ""The situation in the industry is worrisome. Costs are being closely monitored on all fronts. Today, only those projects are moving forward where A-list actors have reduced their fees and are taking a smaller basic amount. This makes it relatively easier for producers to raise funds for the film's production costs.”
He added that this structure is a practical solution for launching new projects amid the industry's cost and funding challenges.
""This is a sustainable model when the primary focus is on raising money solely for the production costs,"" Wadhwa said. ""Producers will find it relatively easier to secure funds for production, either by selling digital rights to streaming platforms or by obtaining support from a studio. In this way, at least the film gets off the ground.”

"As competition heats up, OTTs eye profitability",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/as-competition-heats-up-otts-eye-profitability/articleshow/113992548.cms,06-10-2024,"Indian over-the-top (OTT) platforms are increasingly focusing on cutting losses and aiming for profitability, marking a shift from their earlier focus on subscriber growth and content expansion at the expense of profits, according to industry executives.
With competition intensifying and subscriber growth plateauing, these platforms are now prioritising sustainability. Traditional business profits are under pressure, and external funding is becoming scarce, leading to a decline in aggressive OTT investments. Previously, large media companies funnelled profits into OTT, viewing it as a future-oriented business.
For instance, SVF Entertainment's Bengali OTT platform
Hoichoi
recently posted a modest profit in FY24. Kolkata-headquartered SVF Entertainment is a regional powerhouse with a strong TV and film production business.
The company's executive director, Vishnu Mohta, stated that Hoichoi's FY24 revenue saw a 30% year-on-year increase, with a sixfold growth in margins and profitability. The streaming business operates under a separate entity, Hoichoi Technologies, which has two subsidiaries.

Working out issues with CBFC over certificate for 'Emergency' film: Zee Entertainment tells HC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/working-out-issues-with-cbfc-over-certificate-for-emergency-film-zee-entertainment-tells-hc/articleshow/113903122.cms,03-10-2024,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises
, a co-producer of
Kangana Ranaut
's ""Emergency"" film, on Thursday told the
Bombay High Court
it was working out with the
Censor Board
issues over issuance of certificate for the movie.
The movie, which was initially slated for a September 6 release, has been embroiled in a battle with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), popularly known as the censor board for non-issuance of certificate for release of the movie. Last week, the
CBFC
told the high court that the movie could be released if certain cuts were made as decided by the board's revising committee.
On Thursday, senior counsel Sharan Jagtiani told a division bench of Justices B P Colabawalla and Firdosh Pooniwalla the issues are being worked out. ""I believe it is working out between the CBFC and respondent 2 (Ranaut's
Manikarnika Films
, co-producer),"" Jagtiani said. The bench posted the matter for hearing on Friday.
Earlier this week, the bench was informed by the censor board that Ranaut's production company Manikarnika had agreed to the cuts. The movie's co-producer Zee Entertainment Enterprises had moved HC seeking a direction to the CBFC to issue a certificate for the film ""Emergency"", helmed by Kangana Ranaut.
The biographical drama is caught up in controversy after
Sikh organisations
, including the Shiromani Akali Dal, objected, accusing it of misrepresenting the community and getting historical facts wrong. Zee Entertainment had in its plea claimed that the CBFC had already made the certificate for the movie but was not issuing it.

ZEEL
) aims to deliver higher
profitability
through enhanced
performance
across its businesses and generate better value for all
stakeholders
, the company's Managing Director & CEO,
Punit Goenka
said on Tuesday. Addressing employees at a
town hall
on the company's 32nd anniversary, Goenka said in the next 32 years he envisioned ZEE to ""emerge as a beacon of hope and change for the society"".
""I envisage our purpose should be to enrich the lives of people around the world, by creating such extraordinary moments, that celebrate the power of optimism and togetherness,"" he said.
During the session, Goenka reiterated ZEEL's ""aspirations to deliver higher profitability through enhanced performance across the business and generate higher value for all stakeholders"".
The company said it continues to take the necessary action-oriented steps across the business to enhance the performance and deliver stronger returns, in line with the strategic plan laid out by Goenka, which is centered around frugality, optimisation and a sharp focus on quality content.
The structured steps implemented across the business are displaying positive results as the company remains firmly focused towards its targeted aspirations for future growth, it added.
Live Events
In April this year, Goenka proposed a lean organisation structure to the board with a lateral structure while identifying broadcast, digital, movies and music as core business units. It involved rationalisation of the workforce by 15 per cent to prune staff strength across the company.
He had also announced taking a 20 per cent cut in his remuneration in line with the larger strategic and frugal approach implemented across the organisation.
In August this year, ZEEL and Sony Pictures Networks India had settled their dispute related to the failed USD 10-billion merger and have agreed to withdraw all claims against each other.

CBI
on Tuesday filed a closure report in a case of alleged cheating against former
NDTV
promoters and directors
Prannoy Roy
and
Radhika Roy
as it could not find legally tenable evidence in the Rs 48 crore loss incurred by
ICICI Bank
in the settlement of a loan in 2009, officials said. The case was initiated in 2017 when the CBI registered an FIR based on a complaint from an individual, Sanjay Dutt, of
Quantum Securities
Ltd who alleged that
RRPR Holdings
Pvt Ltd, associated with the Roys, had taken a Rs 500 crore loan from
India Bulls
Pvt Limited to acquire a 20 per cent stake in NDTV through a public open offer.
According to the FIR, RRPR Holdings also took out a Rs 375 crore loan (with Rs 350 crore disbursed) from ICICI Bank at an interest rate of 19 per cent per annum to repay the loan from India Bulls.
The complaint alleged that the Roys pledged their entire shareholding as collateral for this loan, failing to report the pledging to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (
SEBI
), stock exchanges, or the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
In 2022, the
Adani Group
acquired a controlling stake in NDTV, purchasing shares from the Roys at a premium of nearly 17 per cent over the price paid to minority shareholders.

After more than seven years of investigation, the CBI has now filed a closure report with a special court, which will determine whether to accept the report or instruct the agency to continue its probe.
NDTV, following searches conducted on June 5, 2017, stated that the Rs 375 crore loan from ICICI Bank, which it was accused of defaulting on, had been repaid over seven years ago.
The company also asserted that the allegation of failing to disclose the pledging of shares to SEBI was ""incorrect and false"".
""NDTV and its promoters have never defaulted on any loan to ICICI or any other bank. We adhere to the highest levels of integrity and independence,"" the company had emphasised.

Mukta A2 Cinemas launches festive offer with ₹99 cap on F&B,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/mukta-a2-cinemas-launches-festive-offer-with-99-cap-on-fb/articleshow/113843955.cms,01-10-2024,"Cinema exhibitor
Mukta A2 Cinemas
has introduced a disruptive offer for the festive season by capping all
food and beverage
(F&B) prices at ₹99. The chain aims to remove one of the key barriers for cinemagoers—high F&B prices.
“We believe cinema is a universal form of entertainment that should be accessible to everyone. It’s not just about offering films at a great price; it’s about ensuring the entire experience—from buying tickets to enjoying food and drinks—is affordable and enjoyable,” said Satwik Lele, COO of Mukta A2 Cinemas. “By capping food prices at ₹99, we are giving back to our customers, creating an environment where watching a film becomes a celebration without the financial strain.”
This bold initiative comes at a time when the industry is focused on increasing footfall in theatres, particularly in the post-COVID era. Mukta A2 Cinemas’ decision is set to challenge the status quo and redefine value-driven cinema experiences.
Lele added, “We are confident that this initiative will set new standards in the industry. We hope this
festive offer
encourages more people to visit the cinemas and enjoy films in their truest form.”

Multiplex Association defends dynamic ticket pricing, average price in 2023 at Rs 130
This development comes at a time when multiplex chains have faced criticism for exorbitant F&B pricing, which acts as a deterrent for consumers.
Recently,
Karan Johar
, while participating in a panel discussion with other filmmakers, alleged that cinema exhibitors are responsible for high ticket and F&B prices.
He remarked that many families avoid going to cinemas, as the average cost for a family of four, including tickets and popcorn, can amount to ₹10,000, which is not factored into their economic planning.
Following Johar's statement, the
Multiplex Association of India
(MAI) issued a response, asserting that cinema pricing is dynamic and flexible. Prices fluctuate based on factors such as location, day of the week, seat type, film format, and cinema format.

It also stated that exhibitors utilise sophisticated digital tools to stimulate audience demand and optimise pricing, frequently offering discounts and promotions that make cinema outings more affordable, not just during off-peak times but even on popular days.
""Many of these initiatives can lower the overall cost of a cinema visit by more than 50%, providing families and cinema-goers with affordable options. All pricing structures are clearly listed both at cinemas and online, ensuring transparency and choice for customers,"" said MAI president Kamal Gianchandani.
According to MAI, the
Average Ticket Price
(ATP) across all cinemas in India was ₹130 per ticket in 2023. The country’s largest cinema chain, PVR INOX, reported an ATP of ₹258 for the fiscal year 2023-24. Additionally, the Average Spend Per Head (SPH) on F&B at
PVR INOX
during this period stood at ₹132.
This brings the total average expenditure for a family of four to ₹1,560—significantly different from the ₹10,000 figure mentioned in media reports, added MAI, which represents 11 cinema chains, including PVR INOX, which operate around 75% of the multiplex industry in India.

Coldplay ticket row: BookMyShow COO appears before EOW,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/coldplay-ticket-row-bookmyshow-coo-appears-before-eow/articleshow/113827525.cms,01-10-2024,"The chief operating officer of

Big Tree Entertainment
,
Anil Makhija
, appeared before the
Mumbai Police
's Economic Offences Wing (
EOW
) Monday over a petition alleging irregularities in the sale of tickets for British band
Coldplay
's upcoming India tour.
The Mumbai Police are making a preliminary enquiry after a city-based lawyer lodged a complaint with the EOW against the event's ticketing agent BookMyShow, organiser
Live Nation Entertainment
and their top management, accusing them of using
ticket bots
to manipulate the
ticketing process
.
Ordinarily, an FIR is registered if a preliminary enquiry concludes a cognisance offence. Otherwise, it is closed for want of actionable evidence.
The website of BookMyShow crashed briefly on September 22, soon after the sale of tickets for the highly anticipated concert went live, triggering widespread complaints against the ticketing platform. BookMyShow issued a statement denying any involvement in ticket scalping or manipulation. The platform also said it filed a complaint against black marketing of the tickets for the
January shows
.
""With 13 million fans eager to get tickets and logged in, emotions ran high on September 22nd on BookMyShow for Coldplay's tour in India. We worked hard to ensure every fan had a fair chance to secure tickets, capping it at four per user across all shows,"" a spokesperson for the platform said on Monday.

Coldplay 'fake tickets' row: BookMyShow COO appears before Mumbai police,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/coldplay-fake-tickets-row-bookmyshow-coo-appears-before-mumbai-police/articleshow/113820186.cms,30-09-2024,"Anil Makhija
, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of
Big Tree Entertainment
, the parent company of
BookMyShow
, appeared before the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the
Mumbai
Police on Monday, in connection with the ongoing investigation into the
Coldplay concert
‘
fake tickets
’ row.
Earlier on September 27, the police had issued another summon to
Ashish Hemrajani
, the CEO. However, this is the second summon skipped by him and instead Makhija appeared before the officials.
The probe stems from allegations that BookMyShow, along with
Live Nation Entertainment
, engaged in foul play during the
ticket sale process
for Coldplay's highly anticipated Mumbai concert, scheduled for January 2025.
The controversy emerged after a complaint was filed by a lawyer, accusing the companies and their top management of using
ticket bots
to manipulate the ticketing process.
According to the complaint, the firms allegedly logged out genuine fans from the ticketing platform, artificially inflating the digital queue through the use of automated bots. This allegedly stopped actual purchasers from buying tickets for the concert, sparking widespread anger among Coldplay fans.

Viacom18 gets I&B ministry approval to transfer TV channels to Star,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/viacom18-gets-ib-ministry-approval-to-transfer-tv-channels-to-star/articleshow/113770928.cms,28-09-2024,"The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has approved the transfer of TV channel licences from
Viacom18
to
Star India
, subject to conditions set by the
Competition Commission of India
, according to a stock exchange filing by
Reliance Industries
Ltd.
Reliance-owned Viacom18 is merging with
Walt Disney
’s Star India, creating a media powerhouse valued at $8.5 billion. Viacom18's 40 TV channels will join Star's 77, expanding the portfolio to 117 channels across various genres, including general entertainment, sports, kids and youth programming.
This ministry approval is the last clearance needed to finalise the merger announced on February 28. The deal has already received approvals from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the competition watchdog.
The Competition Commission’s approval, granted on August 28, is contingent upon compliance with voluntary modifications to the merger scheme. A full order of the commission is expected soon.
On August 30, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT sanctioned the merger scheme, under which Viacom18 will first transfer its assets to a wholly owned subsidiary, Digital18, which will then transfer them to Star India in exchange for shares, effectively merging the two companies into a unified structure.

Following the asset transfer, Star India will operate as the main company, with Reliance holding a 56% stake. Walt Disney will hold 37% in the combined entity with Uday Shankar and James Murdoch's Bodhi Tree Systems, currently a minority holder in Viacom18, owning the remaining 7%.
The boards of Star India and Viacom18 are expected to meet soon to finalise an effective date for the merger.
Reliance Foundation chairperson Nita Ambani and Reliance Jio Infocomm chairman Akash Ambani recently joined the Viacom18 board. James Murdoch and Mohammed Ahmed Al-Hardan of Qatar Investment Authority, a key investor in Bodhi Tree, are also on the Viacom18 board that also recently inducted
Reliance Industries
president for media and content Jyoti Deshpande and Anagram Partners’ Shuva Mandal.
In the post-merger structure, Nita Ambani will assume the role of chairperson of the newly formed entity, while Uday Shankar, a seasoned media executive and a former head of Star India, will serve as its vice-chairperson.
This merger is poised to create a media giant with a robust presence in both TV and digital platforms, and is expected to yield cost and revenue synergies across content, workforce, technology and monetisation for the combined entity.
Media Partners Asia previously projected that the Star-Viacom18 merger would generate $2.8 billion in revenue, with a pro forma Ebitda loss of $200 million for fiscal 2024. The merged entity is expected to feature a profitable entertainment division alongside loss-making sports and streaming sectors.

, released in 1975, remains one of the most iconic films in Indian cinema. Directed by
Ramesh Sippy
, the movie is a blend of action, drama, and adventure, pulling influences from Spaghetti Westerns, heist movies, and samurai films. Nearly 49 years since its release, the film continues to be a cultural touchstone for both filmmakers and audiences. Despite the film's legendary status, new anecdotes about its making still surface, shedding light on behind-the-scenes dynamics.
Behind the Scenes: Sachin Pilgaonkar's Experience
Recently, actor-director Sachin Pilgaonkar shared some untold stories about his time on the sets of Sholay. Pilgaonkar, who worked as an assistant director on the film, recalled that Ramesh Sippy would personally direct scenes featuring the film's lead actors but delegated some action sequences to a second unit.
""Rameshji decided to have a second unit to do some action sequences which don't feature the main stars. These were just passing shots,"" Sachin said during an interview with the YouTube channel Khaane Mein Kya Hai.
To handle these scenes, Sippy enlisted the help of Mohammed Ali, a well-known stunt filmmaker, and action director Azim, who brought in two Hollywood professionals, Jim and Jerry. Sachin further shared that Ramesh Sippy assigned him and
Amjad Khan
—who played the iconic role of Gabbar Singh—to represent him in managing the second unit.
The Unique Role of Sachin and Amjad Khan
Sachin explained that their involvement came about somewhat humorously. ""At that time, there were only two bekaar (useless) people in the unit: one was Amjad Khan and the other one was me,"" he quipped. According to Sachin, both he and Amjad were interested in directing, a fact Ramesh Sippy knew. As a result, they were given an opportunity to oversee the second unit's activities, a role that kept them close to the action even when the main cast wasn’t on set.

Filming Iconic Scenes Without the Director
Sachin also recounted a particular instance involving the film’s famous
train robbery scene
, which was shot along the Bombay–Poona railway route near Panvel. Ramesh Sippy was not present for this portion of the shoot, as he only directed scenes involving stars like Dharmendra,
Amitabh Bachchan
, and Sanjeev Kumar. ""He was supposed to come only when Dharamji, Amitji, and Hari bhai (Sanjeev Kumar) had work. Rameshji shot those portions, and we handled the remaining scenes,"" Sachin added.
Sholay's Enduring Legacy
Even after nearly five decades, Sholay continues to inspire and influence Indian cinema. With its powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and iconic scenes, the film remains a benchmark for filmmakers. The stories shared by Sachin Pilgaonkar offer a glimpse into the collaborative and creative environment that made the film such a success, highlighting the contributions of every individual involved, from the stars to the second unit.
Sholay is more than just a film; it is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences, both young and old, and its legacy remains intact.

is finding its footing after the success of '

Diwali clash
between
franchise
films '

', as producers challenge the belief that two major releases on the same day during a lean phase may cannibalise each other’s box office collections.
Many industry watchers believe that releasing these films one after the other, with a sufficient gap, could have helped producers realise the true box office potential of both movies — especially considering that very few films have succeeded at the box office since the beginning of the year.
“It remains to be seen if the box office can support two such large films,” said an established producer who wished to remain unnamed.
Some producers, however, feel that the gamble will pay off because both films have different appeals.
Jyoti Deshpande, president of media and content business at
Reliance Industries
, which co-produced 'Stree 2', the highest-grossing film of 2024, said: ""The genres of both films are totally different. Two or more films clashing during a holiday period is not uncommon. Our 'Stree 2' has just emerged as the winner from a three-way clash with other films.""

Reliance Industries’
Jio Studios
is also a co-producer of Ajay Devgn-starrer action film 'Singham Again'.
""We have assembled the biggest ensemble of stars for this Diwali event film. 'Singham Again' will bring together all the cop characters from the 'Singham' franchise along with new cop characters,"" Deshpande said.
‘Singham Again’ was initially slated for an August 15 release but was postponed to avoid clashing with the highly anticipated Telugu film 'Pushpa 2: The Rule', the sequel to 2021's blockbuster 'Pushpa: The Rise'. The release of 'Pushpa 2’, meanwhile, had been postponed to early December.
In recent years, films in the horror-comedy and action genres have been well-received by audiences. This is reflected in the successes of films such as 'Animal', 'Munna', and 'Stree 2'. This trend could potentially work in favour of both '
Bhool Bhulaiyaa
3' (horror-comedy) starring Vidya Balan and Kartik Aaryan, and 'Singham Again' (action), said exhibitors and trade analysts.
Kamal Gianchandani, president of the Multiplex Association of India, said: ""The genres of 'Singham Again' (action) and 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3' (horror comedy) provide differentiated offerings to audiences. It is a long Diwali weekend. One must not consider it a clash of two films.""
There are no capacity constraints in the exhibition industry, as there are enough single and multiplex screens to accommodate both films, Gianchandani said. Additionally, audiences not only have choices but also a compelling reason to return to theatres to watch another film, he added.
Trade analysts are also optimistic about the box office performance of these two films, largely because there is no big film in the line-up for release for five weeks after Diwali.
""The trade circuit is not worried about the clash of these two films. People will watch both films given their different genres and the high recall value of their franchises,” Veteran trade analyst Komal Nahta said. “On a Diwali weekend, people have the spending power. So, two films on a Diwali day can easily work.""
Producer and film business expert Girish Johar added: ""There is enough scope for both films to do well at the box office. These films do not have competition from another big-budget, star-studded film for at least five weeks after Diwali.""

Power & authority come in way of checking spam on OTT platforms,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/power-authority-come-in-way-of-checking-spam-on-ott-platforms/articleshow/113714481.cms,27-09-2024,"The
Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) and the industry regulator-
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai)-have so far had mixed success in checking spams and online scams on
OTT platforms
WhatsApp,
Telegram
and Signal, spotlighting the jurisdictional complexities associated with enforcing curbs on potential offenders, officials told ET.
An official said while WhatsApp is cooperating with the DoT to some extent and has blocked numbers as requested by the government, there is no visible control yet over Telegram and Signal-platforms that need to take concrete steps to curb scams.
""WhatsApp remains committed to ensuring a safe and secure user experience, including weeding out bad actors from the platform,"" said a company spokesperson.
""We continue to make significant product investments with safety features... that help to automatically screen out spam, scams, and calls from unknown numbers... Our advanced
spam detection
technology prevents automation of our services and we ban accounts attempting to spam others.""
The platform banned more than 6 million accounts in July, said the spokesperson.
Live Events
To be sure, the OTT platforms do not fall under the DoT and any action, if required, has to be taken by the
Ministry of Electronics and IT
(Meity), as per the intermediary rules under the IT Act. While the DoT can coordinate with OTT platforms, it cannot take any action against them. DoT has requested Meity multiple times seeking help regarding OTT apps, particularly Signal and Telegram, but there has been little success. One official said DoT has blocked over 20 million mobile numbers so far, but there is little outcome on Signal and Telegram.
Queries sent to Signal and Telegram remained unanswered.
Telcos Concerned
The telecom operators have been highlighting the issue of rising instances of spam on OTT platforms and all the measures to control the menace do not work on OTTs as they are not regulated, either by DoT or Trai.
The regulator, as part of its efforts to curb spam, regularly shares phone numbers as well as headers and templates of commercial communications with telcos for blocking. But of the data, over 55% belong to OTTs where the telcos can't initiate any action.
Every time the regulator asks the telcos to block numbers for spam, their corresponding OTT numbers too have to be blocked. But since telcos can't do it, the numbers are provided to platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram by the DoT for blocking, who have to do that at their end. But unlike telcos, the OTT platforms are not bound by any licence to block the numbers. Further, there are international numbers, from which spam continues to come and telcos have no control over it.
Bharti
Airtel, which has launched an
AI-based solution
to curb spam, too has said the solution won't work on OTT apps. ""That is a pain point . We have been very open with the DoT and the regulator to crack down hard, not just on calls and messages but OTT calls and messages and RCS messages, where a lot of spam can happen. We need a holistic regulatory framework,""
Bharti Airtel
MD and CEO
Gopal Vittal
said.

"Multiplex Association defends dynamic ticket pricing, average price in 2023 at Rs 130",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/multiplex-association-defends-dynamic-ticket-pricing-average-price-in-2023-at-rs-130/articleshow/113672657.cms,25-09-2024,"New Delhi: The
Multiplex Association of India
(MAI) on Wednesday defended ""dynamic and flexible"" cinema pricing, which fluctuates based on factors like location, day of the week, seat type, film format, and cinema format. Cinema exhibitors are now using sophisticated digital tools to stimulate audience demand and optimise pricing, said MAI while issuing a statement over the recent remarks by film maker
Karan Johar
.
Brushing aside Johar's remarks, who alleged high pricing strategies by cinema exhibitors, the MAI statement quoting its President Kamal Gianchandani said the
average ticket price
(ATP) across all cinemas in India was Rs 130 per ticket.
""The country's largest cinema chain, PVRINOX, reported an ATP of Rs 258 for the fiscal year 2023-24. Additionally, the Average Spend Per Head (SPH) on F&B at PVRINOX during this period stood at Rs 132,"" it said adding ""This brings the total average expenditure for a family of four to Rs 1,560 -significantly different from the Rs 10,000 figure carried in the media reports.""
MAI represents 11 cinema chains like
PVR-INOX
, operating around 75 per cent of the multiplex industry of India.
According to media reports, recently Karan Johar, while participating in a panel discussion with some other film makers had alleged cinema exhibitors are responsible for high ticket and food & beverage (F&B) prices.

He said that family members said that they don't like to go to cinema halls as the average cost for a family of four including tickets and popcorn etc can be Rs 10,000, which is not in their economic planning.
MAI said cinema pricing is dynamic and flexible. The exhibitors also frequently offer discounts and promotions that make cinema outings more affordable, not just during off-peak times but even on popular days.
""Many of these initiatives can lower the overall cost of a cinema visit by more than 50 per cent, providing families and moviegoers with affordable options. All pricing structures are clearly listed both at cinemas and online, ensuring transparency and choice for customers,"" it said.
The MAI statement further said the demand for a film is largely driven by its content and appeal, rather than by pricing alone.
""Any evaluation of pricing in the cinema industry must account for the broader economics of movie business, which involves multiple stakeholders, including producers, distributors, and exhibitors,"" it said.
Each of these players contributes to the final cost to consumers, with prices ultimately shaped by the market forces of demand and supply.
""If lowering prices could optimise revenue for everyone involved, cinema operators would naturally make those adjustments without needing to be told,"" it said.
Moreover, cinema exhibitors continuously experiment with pricing models, collecting customer feedback and leveraging data analytics to refine their strategies. This ensures that the current pricing is both competitive and fair in the context of today's market.

Economic Offences Wing
(EOW) of the Mumbai Police has commenced a preliminary enquiry (PE) based on a complaint filed by
Bollywood
producer
Vashu Bhagnani
against a company linked to
Netflix
and 12 others, alleging cheating and conspiracy over rights for three films, people in the know told ET.
The EOW has summoned executives of Los Gatos Production Services India, the entity through which Netflix reports its content investments in India, they said. Netflix rejected the allegations as ""unfounded"".
According to Bhagnani, he has yet to receive ₹47.37 crore towards subscription-video-on-demand (SVOD) rights he had granted on these films: Hero No 1, Mission Raniganj and Bade Miya Chote Miya. He has named Los Gatos Production Services, Zoo Digital India that provides subtitling, dubbing and media localisation services and 10 executives of the two companies as accused.
He also alleged that his company,
Pooja Entertainment
, was coerced into revisiting the commercial terms of the deal and induced to deliver one of the movies to Zoo Digital India that had allegedly leaked the film in public even before its theatrical release, causing him a ""financial and reputation loss"".
Live Events
""These claims are completely unfounded. Indeed, it's Pooja Entertainment that owes Netflix money,"" a Netflix spokesperson told ET. ""We have a strong track record of partnership with the Indian creative community and are working with the authorities to resolve this dispute.""
A senior police official said they registered the PE after verifying the complaint and that an investigation is underway. ""During the course of the enquiry, officials linked to the firm were summoned and they have joined the investigation,"" he said, adding: ""Once the enquiry is completed, based on its findings a call will be taken whether or not to convert the PE into a first information report.""
According to the complaint, Bhagnani's Pooja Entertainment in May 2021 entered into a content licence agreement with Los Gatos Production Services on the SVOD rights of the three films. While Pooja Entertainment was to foot ₹645 crore towards the production and publicity of the films, the accused firm was to pay it ₹281 crore under the multiple films licence agreements, he claimed.

In the absence of fresh blockbusters, re-releasing old films has breathed new life into theaters, surprising the industry by not only helping exhibitors cover fixed costs but also proving that what didn’t work before can succeed when the timing is right.
This strategy has borne fruits and provided reasonably good business to exhibitors after a muted June 2024 quarter.
Gautam Dutta, CEO-
Revenue
& Operations at
PVR INOX

Rockstar
(2011), Ghilli (2004),
Laila Majnu

Tumbbad
(2018) generated footfalls in the range of 4-7 lakh and occupancy of 35-43%.""
He added, ""In all, we have re-released 50 films across languages across our more than 1700 screens and most films have received good response.""
According to Dutta, these 50 films have cumulatively generated 60 lakh footfalls in theatres.

He said that these footfalls are likely to grow in the coming weeks and will amount to 4% of the annual footfalls the multiplex. Ticket prices for these
re-released films
have been set between Rs 112 and Rs 149.
Exhibitors say that running a multiplex screen involves significant fixed costs, including rentals, electricity, water charges, and other operating expenses.
According to the FY24 Annual Report of PVR Inox, fixed costs as a percentage of its total costs is 55.1%.
This highlights the substantial costs multiplexes face in the absence of an attractive lineup of new movies, making the strategy of re-releasing old films a sensible approach.
ET Bureau
Quite favorably, these re-released films have not only generated decent
box office collections
but also boosted food and beverage sales. According to data from multiplexes, popular titles like Ghilli (Tamil), Rockstar (Hindi), and Laila Majnu (Hindi) have brought in Rs10-50 crore since their re-release. Interestingly, trade analysts note that the 2018 film Tumbbad collected Rs 18.9 crore overall, with an opening day haul of Rs 1.65 crore—surpassing the Rs1.15 crore earned by the new release The Buckingham Murders (2024) on its debut.
Devang Sampat, managing director at
Cinepolis India
said, ""We have been engaging with audiences on social media platforms and doing online polling. Through targeted marketing through our social media platforms we select films to showcase in theatres. There is a
demand
for alternate content. Whether it is sporting events or showing old films, the audience is looking for good and engaging content.""
He added, ""In 450 screens, we have a million visitors. Films such as Rockstar (2011) and Tumbbad (2018) have generated stupendous responses from the audience. Though there is a repeat audience for these old films, a large section of the audience belongs to Generation Z who were not born when these films were released.""
Interestingly, Gautam Dutta of PVR said that this strategy of re-releasing old films will be ongoing. He added in future as and when films' pipeline is weak, the multiplex will re-release old films.
When it comes to costs, exhibitors only face the relatively modest marketing expenses for re-releasing old films. In terms of revenue sharing, exhibitors retain 70% of the box office collections, while the remaining 30% goes to the film's distributors or rights holders.
Ameya Naik, a producer and founder of event management company, Fantasy Films, said, ""Footfalls are a function of ticket prices. Though one cannot deny these old films have drawn audiences to theatres in absence of not-so-appealing content, one cannot also rule out the fact that in a fixed ticket price range audiences do come to theatres.”
He added that affordability of ticket prices and fatigue from watching content on personal mobile phones may have contributed to this favourable response from audiences to re-runs of old films.

, is undergoing a strategic overhaul to revitalise the company, with one of the primary focuses being to revamp
Sony Entertainment Television

SET holds only 8% of the market, trailing behind competitors like Star Plus, Colors, and Zee TV. While SET has a strong lineup of non-fiction shows such as

“SPNI's main problem is content. That is one of the key reasons the Sony top brass picked him to succeed NP Singh. The company's fortunes in India are to a large extent linked to SET's turnaround,” said a high-level media executive on condition of anonymity.
As part of its revamp strategy, several underperforming shows Kavya, Jubilee Talkies, and Pukaar have been axed, and SET is airing reruns of those shows alongside new episodes of its popular non-fiction show, Kaun Banega Crorepati.
Banerjee's second priority is to strengthen Sab TV, which had an 18% market share of the pay Hindi GEC market during weeks 34 to 37. To bolster Sab TV, the company has moved Shrimad Ramayan from SET to Sab, positioning it as a family entertainment channel, while SET remains a premium Hindi GEC.
SPNI is also exploring organic and inorganic opportunities in
regional TV entertainment
. Experts believe it is essential for SPNI's future expansion.
“Regional entertainment particularly South has been driving linear TV's growth even as the Hindi market is seeing a decline. SPNI cannot afford to ignore this space,” a media expert said.
In
sports broadcasting
, SPNI plans to focus on cost-efficient properties, avoiding the financial losses associated with major sports events. It holds rights to cricket boards in England, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka and premium football and tennis properties like UEFA and Roland Garros.
“SPNI will consider bidding for Asian Cricket Council rights only if it makes financial sense,” said a sports expert. On the streaming front, SPNI will focus on non-fiction content for SonyLIV. It is well-positioned to lead in the non-fiction segment with properties like KBC, MasterChef, and Shark Tank.
""Most of the premium streaming platforms in India are very heavy on fiction. With properties like KBC, MasterChef, and Shark Tank, SonyLIV is well-positioned to lead this segment,"" the media expert said.
In line with this strategy, the platform is planning to launch the India version of two-time Emmy-nominated series Million Dollar Listing, an American reality television series that premiered in 2006.
Assisting Gaurav Banerjee in turning around the entertainment channels are Nachiket Pantvaidya (head of SET), Ajay Bhalwankar (head of Sab TV), and Tushar Shah (head of Hindi movies, regional entertainment, and infotainment). In addition, Banerjee had also roped in Shamath Majumdar as lead for content sourcing and curation for Hindi and Anurati Tandon as chief of staff.

Now playing! Second show of movies at theatres near you,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/now-playing-second-show-of-movies-at-theatres-near-you/articleshow/113577690.cms,23-09-2024,"In the absence of fresh blockbusters, re-releasing old films has breathed new life into theaters, surprising the industry by not only helping exhibitors cover fixed costs but also proving that what didn't work before can succeed when the timing is right.
This strategy has borne fruits and provided reasonably good business to exhibitors after a muted June 2024 quarter.
Gautam Dutta, CEO, revenue & operations at
PVR INOX
said, ""From a slightly muted response in the beginning, we have seen strong response from audiences. Films such as
Rockstar
(2011),
Ghilli
(2004),
Laila Majnu
(2018) and
Tumbbad
(2018) generated footfalls in the range of 4-700000 and occupancy of 35-43%."" He added, ""In all, we have re-released 50 films across languages across our more than 1,700 screens and most films have received good response.""
According to Dutta, these 50 films have cumulatively generated 60,00,000 footfalls in theatres.

He said that these footfalls are likely to grow in the coming weeks and will amount to 4% of the annual footfalls the multiplex. Ticket prices for these
re-released films
have been set between ₹112 and ₹149.
Exhibitors say that running a multiplex screen involves significant fixed costs, including rentals, electricity, water charges, and other operating expenses.
According to the FY24 annual report of PVR Inox, fixed costs as a percentage of its total costs is 55.1%. This highlights the substantial costs
multiplexes
face in the absence of an attractive lineup of new movies, making the strategy of re-releasing old films a sensible approach.
Quite favorably, these re-released films have not only generated decent
box office collections
but also boosted food and beverage sales. According to data from multiplexes, popular titles like Ghilli (Tamil), Rockstar (Hindi), and Laila Majnu (Hindi) have brought in ₹10-50 crore since their re-release. Interestingly, trade analysts note that the 2018 film Tumbbad collected ₹18.9 crore overall, with an opening day haul of ₹1.65 crore-surpassing the ₹1.15 crore earned by the new release The Buckingham Murders (2024) on its debut. Devang Sampat, managing director at
Cinepolis India
said, ""We have been engaging with audiences on social media platforms and doing online polling. Through targeted marketing through our social media platforms we select films to showcase in theatres. There is a demand for alternate content. Whether it is sporting events or showing old films, the audience is looking for good and engaging content.""

Though there is a repeat audience for these old films, a large section of the audience belongs to Generation Z who were not born when these films were released.""

"India probing Netflix for visa violations, racial discrimination, email shows",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/india-probing-netflix-for-visa-violations-racial-discrimination-email-shows/articleshow/113567716.cms,22-09-2024,"NEW DELHI: India is investigating the business practices of U.S. streaming giant
Netflix
's local operations, including allegations of visa violations and racial discrimination, according to a government email sent to a former executive.
The details of India's investigation were included in a July 20 email, reviewed by Reuters, which was written by a home ministry official to Netflix's former director of business and legal affairs for India, Nandini Mehta, who left the company in 2020.
""This is regarding visa and tax violations concerns regarding the business practices of Netflix in India,"" wrote Indian official Deepak Yadav from the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) of the home ministry in New Delhi.
""We have received certain details in this regard w.r.t (with respect to) the stated company's conduct, visa violation, illegal structures, tax evasion and other malpractices including incidents of racial discrimination that company has been engaged in while conducting its business in India,"" he added.
In an emailed statement, Mehta said she is pursuing a lawsuit in U.S. against Netflix for alleged wrongful termination as well as racial and gender discrimination - charges the company denies.

Mehta said she welcomed the Indian investigation and hopes the authorities make their findings public, but did not elaborate on the allegations made by the government.
Yadav declined to comment, saying he was not authorized to speak to media. The FRRO and India's home ministry did not respond to Reuters queries.
A Netflix spokesperson said the company was ""unaware of an investigation by the Indian government.""
The Indian official's email shows growing scrutiny of Netflix in India, where it has roughly 10 million users and which it considers a growth market where companies target affluent people in the nation of 1.4 billion people.
Over the years, the U.S. streaming giant has developed more local content featuring Bollywood actors.
It has also often faced heat in India over its content deemed insensitive by some users. This month, it was forced to add new disclaimers to an Indian series about a plane hijack after social media outrage and government anger over what they said was Muslim hijackers being shown as Hindus.
SEEKING DOCUMENTS, U.S. LAWSUIT
While it is known that Netflix has since 2023 faced an Indian tax demand - which it is challenging - the existence of a broader investigation into allegations including visa compliance and racial discrimination has not been previously reported.
The Indian government's email did not elaborate which agencies are looking at issues concerning Netflix. The FRRO works closely with home ministry's Intelligence Bureau, the domestic intelligence agency, and is the main agency looking into foreigners' visa compliance and permissions to visit so-called ""sensitive"" regions.
Last year, India accused Chinese smartphone player Vivo and its Indian affiliates for breaching visa rules by visiting certain ""sensitive"" regions without permission. India classifies parts of certain states such as Jammu & Kashmir in north and Sikkim in east as restricted areas.
The FRRO also acts as a liaison in matters related to foreigners with other government offices.
Mehta worked at the company's Los Angeles and Mumbai offices from April 2018 to April 2020, her LinkedIn profile shows.
The Indian government email asked her to provide ""details/documents"" as she was a former legal executive of the company.
In 2021, Mehta sued Netflix in Los Angeles County Superior Court in California for alleged wrongful termination and racial and gender discrimination, among other things, U.S. court filings show.
Netflix has in U.S. court denied ""each and every allegation"" and said in its statement that Mehta was fired for repeatedly using her corporate credit card for tens of thousands of dollars in personal expenses.
Mehta said she will ""continue to fight for justice."" Her case is set for a status hearing on Monday in Los Angeles.

The draft rules issued on September 13 now mandate that all content on OTT platforms must feature non-skippable anti-tobacco health spots of at least 30 seconds, as well as a non-skippable audio-visual disclaimer on the harmful effects of tobacco use, lasting a minimum of 20 seconds, upon opening the platform.
""Essentially, streaming platforms will now be required to show these health spots and disclaimers not only at the beginning and middle of programs, but also as soon as the platform is opened,"" explained an official source. ""Currently, the health spots and disclaimers are not displayed immediately upon opening the platform.""
India became the first country in May 2022 to make it mandatory for OTT platforms to show anti-tobacco warnings and disclaimers similar to those seen in theatrical releases and TV programs, prioritizing public health.
The OTT rules of 2023 took effect on September 1, 2023. Under these rules, platforms like

cinema attendance
on September 20th, 2024, as millions of film enthusiasts went to theatres to celebrate
National Cinema Day
. The annual event, which allowed moviegoers to watch films for just Rs 99 per ticket, saw a record turnout, drawing more than 60 lakh people to cinema halls in India.
This year’s National Cinema Day expanded to over 4,000 screens across India, including leading chains such as
PVR INOX
, Cinepolis, Miraj, CityPride, Asian Cinemas, Mukta A2, MovieTime, Wave Cinemas, Moviemax, and others. With participation from a wide range of regional and national cinema chains, the event showcased the appeal of the big screen experience despite the challenges the cinema industry has faced recently.
This year’s cinematic offerings for National Cinema Day featured a diverse range of films. Major releases and re-releases like Stree 2, Yudhra, Tumbbad, Kahan Shuru Kahan Khatam, and The Buckingham Murders proved to be crowd-pullers, drawing large numbers of moviegoers.
In addition to these mainstream hits, the lineup also included international blockbusters such as Transformers One and Never Let Go, along with regional films. Movies like Navra Maza Navsacha – 2 (Marathi), Sucha Soorma (Punjabi), Ardaas Sarbat De Bhale Di (Punjabi), Mathu Vadalara 2 (Telugu), and Kishkindha Kandam (Tamil) catered to the diverse tastes of audiences.
The
Indian cinema
industry has been grappling with lower box-office collections in the first eight months of 2024. According to data from Ormax Media, box-office earnings from January to August 2024 amounted to Rs 6,868 crore, a 7.5% decline compared to the same period in 2023. This dip has been attributed to a lack of major film releases earlier in the year, coupled with distractions like the Lok Sabha elections and major cricketing events.

'Tumbbad': Can you watch this cult horror film on OTT as it breaks box-office records?
Karan Taurani, Senior Vice President at Elara Capital, believes that the remaining months of 2024 will outshine the same period last year, thanks to the release of highly anticipated Indian and Hollywood films.
While Hindi films contributed 40% of total box-office collections in August 2024, marking an increase from 35% in July, regional films like Telugu and Malayalam releases, which had performed well earlier in the year, have recently experienced a decline. Analysts believe that this shift in audience preferences towards Hindi and big-budget films will continue in the latter half of the year, as franchises and star-driven films dominate the box office.
Big franchise films like Pushpa 2: The Rule, Singham 3, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3, and Baby John are expected to draw large audiences, especially during the festive season. These films have built a strong fan base over the years, and their return to theatres is highly awaited.
Hollywood also has an exciting slate lined up for Indian audiences, with films like Venom: The Last Dance, Joker: Folie à Deux, Blitz, Gladiator 2, and The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim set to hit theatres in the coming months.

Asian Cricket Council faces a tough media rights test,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/asian-cricket-council-faces-a-tough-media-rights-test/articleshow/113533760.cms,21-09-2024,"Mumbai: The
Asian Cricket Council
's
media rights
sale is set to undergo a critical test as it will be the first auction after Walt Disney Co and
Reliance Industries
received regulatory clearance to merge
Viacom18
with
Star India
.
According to the tender released by the
ACC
on September 16, the base price for the media rights for the 2024–31 cycle is $170 million, which is almost double of the $80-90 million that Star, the incumbent rights holder paid for the 2016-23 cycle, people privy to the matter told ET. Meanwhile, industry experts say the ongoing consolidation in the industry and the challenges faced by media companies may result in subdued bidding.
The media rights will be sold through an e-auction, with the deadline to purchase the tender document set for September 30. Unlike other cricket properties, the TV and digital rights of the ACC events will not be sold separately.
The rights package includes the
Asia Cup
tournaments for men and woman, as well as Under-19 and emerging teams’ competitions. Four editions of the Men’s Asia Cup are slated for 2025, 2027, 2029, and 2031. India will host the Asia Cup next year.

Star claims $940 million damages from ZEE over failed deal
The Asia Cup remains the last significant
cricket rights
deal available in the market. It will offer insights into the potential future of major cricket properties.
Major contenders like Star India, Viacom18,
Sony Pictures Networks
India (SPNI),
Zee Entertainment
, and Dream Sports-owned FanCode are expected to purchase the tender documents. However, it remains uncertain how many will make serious bids.
Analysts also highlight that the Indian Premier League (IPL), International Cricket Council (ICC), and Board of Control for Cricket in India (
BCCI
) media rights have already absorbed a significant portion of the sports rights budgets.
These three properties, along with Cricket Australia, Cricket South Africa, the England and Wales Cricket Board and New Zealand Cricket, have secured over $10 billion in commitments from Star, Viacom18, and SPNI.
IPL media rights
alone are valued at $6 billion, while ICC rights are worth $3 billion.

The value of the IPL has decreased by 11.7% year-over-year to $9.9 billion in 2024, reflecting the impact of consolidation on media rights values, according to D and P Advisory.
An aggressive base price will also discourage serious players from bidding, said analysts.
“The ACC media rights bidding is taking place amid significant shifts in the industry. On the one hand, Star-Viacom18, which already holds most of the major cricket rights, may lack interest in acquiring another property,"" said Rajesh Sethi, senior advisor for media and entertainment with PwC and ex-CEO of Ten Sports.
""On the other hand, Sony is eager to rebuild its India business after the failed deal with Zee. Meanwhile, Zee is prioritising profitability and is unlikely to take a risk on cricket. Tech giants are expected to pass on this opportunity once again,"" Sethi said.
Following conditional approval from the Competition Commission of India, Star and Viacom18 may tread cautiously, mindful of potential additional scrutiny from regulators, according to high-level media executives who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The executives noted that SPNI, under new chief Gaurav Banerjee, is likely to be keen on bidding for ACC rights, provided the cost is reasonable. The company narrowly missed out on BCCI rights to Viacom18 and holds the rights for England, Sri Lanka and New Zealand cricket, among others. It has steered clear of pursuing high-cost sports assets to maintain profitable growth.
Zee Entertainment, which is embroiled in a $940 million dispute with Star over a failed ICC TV deal, is unlikely to participate in the bidding. CEO Punit Goenka recently indicated that the company's balance sheet does not support heavy sports investments.
In 2021, Zee re-entered sports by acquiring UAE’s International League T20 /media rights. The company has initiated aggressive cost-cutting measures to get back to 18-20% Ebitda margins.
Amazon Prime Video, which holds New Zealand Cricket rights in India and ICC rights in Australia, has refrained from high-cost cricket investments. Similarly, Apple and Netflix, despite expanding into live sports globally, have shown little interest in cricket rights.
Meanwhile, Google-owned YouTube, a pioneer in live-streaming cricket with IPL in 2010, doesn't need to invest in content due to its dominance in India with user-generated content.

Israel: Mossad’s daring spy ops that became iconic movie plots,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/israel-mossads-daring-spy-ops-that-became-iconic-movie-plots/articleshow/113493368.cms,19-09-2024,"Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, has long been associated with daring operations, often making headlines for its missions deep within enemy territories.
Mossad
's capability of carrying out mind-blowing operations came to light two days ago when thousands of pagers belonging to Hezbollah operatives began detonating across
Lebanon
, killing at least 12 people and wounding thousands. In a second wave of such attacks, wireless sets, solar power, home appliances, etc. too began exploding. Reportedly, Israel inserted explosives into these devices and later triggered them remotely. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the explosions, though 12 current and former defence and intelligence officials who were briefed on the attack told The New York Times on the condition of anonymity that the Israelis were behind it.
In keeping with Mossad's tradition of mounting daring operations, Israel had put into motion a plan to establish a shell company that would pose as an international pager producer, the NYT reported. ""By all appearances, B.A.C. Consulting was a Hungary-based company that was under contract to produce the devices on behalf of a Taiwanese company, Gold Apollo. In fact, it was part of an Israeli front, according to three intelligence officers briefed on the operation. They said at least two other shell companies were created as well to mask the real identities of the people creating the pagers: Israeli intelligence officers,"" the NYT wrote.
John Hannah of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, who was a national security adviser to Dick Cheney when the latter was the US vice president, described the
pager attack
as ""another stunning display of Israeli intelligence prowess"". He told AFP that Mossad has demonstrated ""a repeated ability not only to deeply penetrate its worst adversaries' most sensitive networks, but then execute operations of exquisite precision and lethality whenever it chooses to do so"".
Mossad's highly innovative operations seem so incredulous and far away from reality that several of them have attracted attention of film makers who would have little trouble bringing these dramatic operations to the screen.
From hostage rescues to targeted assassinations, the
Mossad operations
have turned into hit cinematic thrillers, offering a closer look into the workings of the world's most feared intelligence agency. Below are five notable film productions based on real-life operations which offer interesting glimpses into the enigmatic world of Mossad.

The Spy (Netflix series)
""The Spy"" (Netflix series) brings to life the gripping story of Eli Cohen, one of Israel’s legendary Mossad agents. Cohen, an ordinary Israeli desk operative, was recruited to go deep undercover in Syria on a mission that would change the course of history. Posing as a wealthy Arab businessman named Kamel Amin Thaabet, Cohen embedded himself in Syrian high society, earning the trust of military officials and politicians. His years-long mission saw him rising through the ranks of Syrian politics, eventually becoming a close confidant of future Syrian President Amin al-Hafiz. Cohen even secured a position as the country’s Deputy Defense Minister. His access to sensitive military secrets proved vital to Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War.
Munich
""Munich"" dives deep into the dark aftermath of the Munich massacre, where a Palestinian group called Black September kidnapped and murdered Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics. This shocking event shook the world and prompted Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir to take drastic action. The film follows a team of Mossad agents as they embark on a secret mission known as the ""Wrath of God"" to assassinate the militants.
The Red Sea Diving Resort
""The Red Sea Diving Resort"" is based on one of Mossad’s most daring missions, Operation Brothers. In the early 1980s, thousands of Ethiopian Jews, fleeing war, had crossed into Sudan, a hostile Arab-majority country. Mossad devised a bold plan to rescue them, setting up a fake diving resort on the Red Sea as a front for smuggling refugees to safety. What seemed like a luxury resort for tourists was, in reality, a cover for covert operations. Israeli agents, posing as resort staff, worked behind the scenes to move people out of Sudan. Using Trans European Airways, Mossad organised about 30 covert flights, transporting nearly 8,000 Ethiopian Jews from Sudan to Israel in just seven weeks.
Operation Finale
""Operation Finale"" is based on the real-life Mossad and Shin Bet mission to capture one of the most notorious Nazi war criminals, Adolf Eichmann. After World War II, Eichmann, a key architect of the Holocaust, fled to Argentina, where he lived undercover for years. In the 1960s, Israeli intelligence agents tracked him down, launching a covert operation to bring him to justice.
Kidon
""Kidon"" is a unique mix of spy action and comedy, inspired by the real-life assassination of Hamas commander Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh in Dubai in 2010. Al-Mabhouh, a co-founder of Hamas’s military wing, was wanted by Israel for the kidnapping and murder of two soldiers in 1989 as well as for smuggling arms from Iran to Gaza. His assassination in a Dubai hotel room, long linked to Mossad, sparked international headlines.
The Angel
""The Angel"" on Netflix offers a fascinating look into the life of Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian official who became a double agent and played a crucial role to achieve peace in Israel. The movie is based on the real events described in a book, 'The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel', which recounts the remarkable story of Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian diplomat, who was also the son-in-law of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Operating under the Mossad code name ""The Angel"", Marwan provided vital intelligence to Israel, including a critical warning about the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This information gave Israel a chance to prepare for the joint Egyptian-Syrian attack, preventing a potential disaster.

Video on demand category generated $1.04 billion in revenues during H1 2024,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/video-on-demand-category-generated-1-04-billion-in-revenues-during-h1-2024/articleshow/113484377.cms,19-09-2024,"The premium video-on-demand (VOD) category, driven by advertising and subscriptions, generated $1.04 billion in revenues during the first half of 2024, a 38% increase from $760 million in the same period in 2023.
Local content
accounted for 86% of
premium VOD
engagement, with live sports and local drama and romance leading demand.
Sports content attracted the highest number of unique viewers, with 9 of the top 15 titles being sports-related, 6 of which were BCCI events. Cricket stood out, as IPL 2024 and the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 were the top two sports properties driving significant viewership.
These insights come from the latest analysis by ampd, a digital measurement platform owned by Media Partners Asia (MPA), which tracks consumption and engagement across India's digital economy, including VOD.
In H1 2024, a total of 8 trillion minutes were streamed across online video platforms in India. YouTube dominated with 92% of all online video consumption, while premium platforms—including AVOD, freemium, and SVOD services—accounted for the remaining 8%. Among premium platforms, freemium services led with 92% of the 645 billion minutes streamed during the same period.
Jio Cinema, Netflix, and Disney+ Hotstar were the top contributors to premium VOD revenue, accounting for nearly 70% of total category revenues.
Jio Cinema
led the category with a 36% revenue share, while
Netflix
led pure-play SVOD monetization with a 38% share.
Live Events
Premium VOD ad revenue in H1 2024 was driven by Jio Cinema and Disney+ Hotstar, leveraging marquee cricket events like IPL and the ICC World Cup. After a challenging 2023, total
SVOD subscriptions
rebounded from 110 million to 120 million in H1 2024. India’s affluent audience base continues to expand, with Netflix and Prime Video capitalising on this trend through investments in local content, accounting for nearly 70% of SVOD revenue in the period. Jio Cinema’s affordable plan has further broadened the SVOD audience, encouraging more users to pay for streaming.
MPA India Vice President Mihir Shah commented, “Subscriber growth will continue in 2H 2024, driven by partnerships with telcos, pay-TV operators, and OEMs. With the festive season approaching, advertising spending is expected to be strong in Q4 2024. However, with no major sports events, spending will shift to non-fiction shows on premium VOD platforms, while a significant portion will return to high-reach UGC platforms. Netflix and Prime Video have a steady stream of content planned for H2 2024. For freemium platforms, entertainment spending is returning through new advertising-friendly formats like TV++, similar to daily TV soap operas with 40-120+ episodes per season, which attract new users and drive engagement with lower budgets.”

Box office pins hopes on festive 'hits' as silver screen fails to dazzle,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/box-office-pins-hopes-on-festive-hits-as-silver-screen-fails-to-dazzle/articleshow/113467785.cms,19-09-2024,"Box-office collections in India in the first eight months of 2024 are lower compared with the same period last year, due to underperformance of films and lack of big releases in the first half of the year amid the Lok Sabha elections and cricketing events, say industry experts.
According to
Ormax Media
data, the cumulative
box office
for January to August 2024 was Rs 6,868 crore, a 7.5% fall from a year earlier.
The top 5 grossers were Kalki 2898 AD, Stree 2, Fighter, Hanu-Man and Shaitaan. In the same period last year, collections were powered by Pathaan, Gadar 2, Jailer, Adipurush and The Kerala Story.
According to industry analysts, while the first half of the year was slower, the second half may see strong performances, particularly with highly anticipated releases like Pushpa 2 and Singham 3 slated for release during the festive season.

""The Hindi box-office collections in 2024 will be lower than 2023 since we had three films that did business of Rs 500 crore last year. Having said that, it's been a good year for the industry despite the underperformance of some big films and lack of releases due to elections and cricket in the first half,"" said trade analyst Taran Adarsh. He predicts 2025 to be a blockbuster year for the industry.
""The 7.5% decline compared to Jan-Aug 2023 is primarily due to content performance. Telugu and Malayalam are the only languages to have shown growth over last year, while Hollywood and Tamil saw the steepest declines, with drops of 39% and 30%, respectively. Interestingly, the top two highest-grossing films of 2024 (Kalki 2898 AD, Stree 2) have cumulatively outperformed the top two films of 2023 (Pathaan, Gadar 2). However, both Jailer and Adipurush (released in Jan-Aug 2023) had crossed the ₹300 crore mark, a feat that no film in 2024 managed to achieve, apart from the top two titles,"" said Ormax Media Head of Business Development (Theatrical) Sanket Kulkarni.
While August recorded the highest box-office collections in 2024 at Rs 1,291 crore on the back of Stree 2's strong performance, it was still 20% lower compared with Rs 1,610 crore in August 2023.
With gross box-office collections of Rs 680 crore, Stree 2 is poised to dethrone Jawan as the highest grossing Hindi film of all time. Jawan's lifetime collection is pegged at Rs 734 crore across languages. Kalki 2898 AD is the highest grosser of 2024 so far with collections of Rs 774 crore.
Stree 2 was the only film to gross over Rs 100 crore in August, capitalising on the extended weekend during the Independence Day week, which is historically a prime release window for films.
Driven by Stree 2, Hindi films contributed 40% of the total collections in August, up from 35% in July, Ormax data show. Telugu and Malayalam films, which saw success in the earlier months of the year, have recently experienced a decline, it added.
Karan Taurani, senior vice president at Elara Capital, believes the second half of 2024 will be much better than the same period of last year due to the release of big franchise Indian films like Pushpa 2: The Rule, Singham 3, Bhool Bhulaiya 3 and Baby John, and an impressive Hollywood slate of Venom: The Last Dance, Joker: Folie à Deux, Blitz, Gladiator 2 and The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.
""I foresee 25-30% growth in box-office collections on a year-on-year comparison,"" he said.
Striking a more cautionary note, Manoj Desai, executive director of the Mumbai-based G7 multiplex and Maratha Mandir movie hall, said the exhibition industry is in a wait-and-watch mode as some of the big films comprising leading film stars are not working.
""No doubt the line-up of big films is impressive and gives some hope of increasing collections. But one cannot deny that there is a wave of uncertainty in the industry that is pronounced and inescapable,"" he said.

TV18 is a listed entity that holds a 13.54% stake in Viacom18, which is currently in the process of merging with Disney's Star India. E18, an unlisted subsidiary of Network18, owns news portal Moneycontrol.
According to a recent report by India Ratings (Ind-Ra), Viacom18 contributes approximately 80% of Network18's consolidated revenue. However, after Viacom18's transfer to Star India, Network18's size and scale will significantly decrease, it said.
Ind-Ra, however, noted that this reduction in scale will not impact the strong strategic and operational linkages between Network18 and RIL as the remaining news media businesses will remain strategically important to RIL.
During RIL's annual general meeting on August 29, chairman Mukesh Ambani had said Network18 is now leading in both general and business news and is the only Indian network with global ambitions. ""I believe it is time for India, as the world's most populous nation, to assert its voice and gain its rightful space in the influential global media,"" he said.
The merged entity will include TV18's 20 news channels in 16 languages, along with Network18's digital assets. Network18's market cap stood at Rs 9,442 crore on Tuesday, while TV18 had a market cap of Rs 8,348 crore.
As part of the merger, TV18 shareholders will receive 100 shares of Network18 for every 172 shares held in TV18, while E18 shareholders will receive 19 shares of Network18 for every share held in E18.

OTT rules come into focus after outrage over Kandahar series,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ott-rules-come-into-focus-after-outrage-over-kandahar-series/articleshow/113403609.cms,17-09-2024,"The controversy over
Netflix
’s ‘IC-814—The Hijack of Kandahar’ series has reignited the debate over having tighter
content regulation
for over-the-top (OTT) platforms in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (
MIB
), people privy to the development told ET.
The series, based on the hijack of an
Indian Airlines
flight in 1999, faced
social media outrage
for inaccuracies including changing the names of the hijackers.
Netflix India agreed to include an updated disclaimer on the real and code names of the hijackers, Ibrahim Akhtar, Shahid Akhtar Sayeed, Sunny Ahmed Qazi, Zahoor Mistry, and Shakir.
The key concern that the MIB has about the web series is that it claims to be a work of fiction while promoting it as a true story, people cited above said. Further, the platform has put up a disclaimer only in India and not in other international territories.
“If foreign streaming platforms continue to behave like this, the MIB will be compelled to come out with a tighter content regulation for OTT platforms, which could extend to pre-certification of content also,” a government official said on condition of anonymity.
Live Events
Both the MIB and Netflix declined to comment.
OTT insiders expressed concern over tighter content regulation.
“This reaction can have a chilling effect on the industry… (It is) likely to curtail free speech and the ability for anyone to tell a story of any authenticity,” said an OTT expert who requested not to be identified.
Legal experts argued that the issue over the names of characters is specific to India and hence the updated disclaimer is only applicable there.
A petition seeking withdrawal of the series was also filed in the
Delhi High Court
for assigning Hindu names such as Bhola and Shankar to the hijackers. The petition was withdrawn later.
Unlike TV broadcasting, which has to adhere to program code under the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act 1995, there is no content regulation for OTT.
The government was planning to bring OTT under the regulatory framework through the Broadcast Bill, which has been put on the backburner following opposition from media organisations and independent content creators.
Currently, the OTT platforms have to follow a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism under the IT Rules 2021. The three-tier mechanism includes self-regulation by publishers, publishers having a self-regulatory body, and oversight mechanism by the government.
In the case of IC-814, the MIB acted with restraint despite mounting public pressure, the official quoted above said. “The government could have asked Netflix to either edit the show or take down the content under Section 69 of the IT Act. However, it didn’t take any adverse steps,” the official said.
In the past, the ministry has received complaints from social and religious organisations against multiple OTT shows including Grahan (Disney+ Hotstar), Bombay Begum (Netflix), and Tandav (Amazon Prime Video).
In some cases, the streaming platforms had agreed to remove scenes that were deemed controversial. Tandav is a case in point.
Experts said the IC-814 controversy underscores the challenge of balancing creative freedom and responsible content creation on OTT platforms in India.

Why finding the right music for reels is one of the biggest challenges for content creators on Instagram,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/reeling-in-a-song/articleshow/113354876.cms,14-09-2024,"Ankita Shrivastav
calls the process of finding the right audio to go with her
Instagram
posts “a family affair”.
“Everyone pitches in with suggestions, and when I don’t pick their choice, I end up sending apology notes,” says the Mumbai-based actor and standup comedian. She thanks them for at least keeping her up to date with the latest trends in music. Known as @filmychokri on Instagram, where she has nearly 600,000 followers, Shrivastav admits that the music selection process has sometimes delayed the uploading of her posts by 20 to 40 minutes.
“It’s not just about picking a track,” she says. “It has to be aesthetically right, it has to match the story you are trying to tell in the Reel and match the story that’s going on in the world at the time… It has to be today and trending.”
Searching for the perfect audio to go with your content feels more like finding a life partner, Shrivastav adds. “So many boxes to check, so much pressure to get it right.” While idea blocks and monetisation may be their biggest challenges, on a day-to-day basis, many creators struggle to simply find the right audio to complement their content. It’s not just about music enhancing the content; the platform now explicitly tells them that an audio companion will amplify their reach.
Last week, Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, posted a Reel explaining why he recommends that users incorporate audio in their posts.
Live Events
“First, using audio makes your content more engaging and immersive.” When audio is on—and half the time people tend to keep it on—you are more likely to capture someone’s attention. Using audio in
Reels
specifically allows users a chance to appear on the app’s Audio page, too, he adds. “Many people go to the Audio page for inspiration. This exposure can also help increase your reach,” Mosseri says in his video that, ironically, has no audio beyond his voiceover.
Instagram helps users find
trending audios
by highlighting them in its audio library and marking them as “trending” when they appear elsewhere on the app. This year, the Meta-owned app launched several audio features, including music on profile, “Add Yours” music sticker, music in content notes, music in mixed-media carousels and multitrack audio on Reels.
“For creators, music often serves as the starting point for an idea, which they then bring to life,” says
Paras Sharma
, director–global partnerships, India,
Meta
. “These features allow users to express themselves through humour, dance and dialogue, and make their content more engaging,” he adds.
Among the latest trending audios,
Karan Aujla
’s “Tauba Tauba” from Bad Newz has inspired nearly 4 million Re e l s, wh i l e A k s h a t h A c h a r y a ’ s “Nadaaniyan” is the background for about 2.4 million Reels. Though the former lends itself to dance videos predominantly, the latter has been used in Reels of varying themes, ranging from romance to drama to comedy. However, the problem with trending audio, says Mandar Thakur, CEO of Times Music, is that “no one knows if too”.
People often use trending regional music without considering that the lyrics might not align with their content’s theme, but a discerning audience can spot the mismatch. Creators also complain about not being able to find the music of their choice. Thakur reckons that short-video-sharing platforms are fairly young. “Their audience has evolved faster than the product, so they seem to be catching up and building use cases,” he adds.
Meanwhile, creators have found ways to bypass Instagram’s limited music library. For instance, “A creator looking for horror audio might add their own music to the video while editing but would choose a trending track from Instagram’s library when posting,” says Shubhi Raina, head of content at Hypp. “They lower the trending audio’s volume to 0 or 2, so their preferred audio stands out while the trending track boosts engagement.”
However, using external audio often leads to copyright strikes from labels, which can mute the original audio and make the content inaccessible. Today, how an audience perceives content largely depends on the music, says Raina. “A rant with serious music feels different from one with a comedic tune.”
She points to “Ja Chudail” from Delhi Belly, which works as both party anthem and heartbreak song “Maybe Instagram should introduce a ‘songmoji’ feature to let users search songs by the emotion or intent they want to convey,” she suggests, in all seriousness. Even amateur creators are in the rush to find the perfect song.
Niharika Gotety, a business strategist at a consumer internet company in Gurgaon, admits to listening to trending Instagram audios (in full) just to find the right beats for her posts. “I save Reels for future audio and keep a private playlist of songs with good beats,” she says. At times, she has skipped posting a Reel and chosen static images since she couldn’t find the right music.
“Videos need music,” says Gotety. “It’s like ASMR—it taps into the part of your brain that craves perfectly synced beats and visuals. That’s why even random audio can go viral when it matches the video, satisfying our need for synchronisation.” This frenzy has made content creation on the app revolve around a trending, 15-second track, says Akshat (@akshatgram), a comedian-creator from Delhi.
“When your reach relies on the music in your post, it starts to dictate your content, often stifling creativity,” he says. For example, while “Big Dawgs” is a great track, it doesn’t fit every sentiment. Personally, he tackles the audio dilemma by “not caring too much” and sometimes using nothing or anything.
He does, however, worry what will happen if “the entire ecosystem accepts that you can’t go viral with your own song choice”. “Then everyone will just dance to a ‘Tauba Tauba’ to get noticed.”

Balaji Telefilms invests ₹795 cr in its OTT Arm,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/balaji-telefilms-invests-795-cr-in-its-ott-arm/articleshow/113249571.cms,11-09-2024,"Mumbai: Ektaa Kapoor-helmed
Balaji Telefilms
has made a cumulative investment of Rs 795 crore in its over-the-top (OTT) subsidiary
ALT Digital Media Entertainment
, the content production company said in its annual report for 2023-24.
The subsidiary owns and operates entertainment streaming platform ALTT, which was earlier known as
ALT Balaji
. The platform was launched in April 2017 as part of Balaji Telefilms’ expansion into the business-to-consumer segment.
Apart from the investments, Balaji Telefilms also provided loans, including interest accrued thereon, aggregating to Rs 103 crore. The company's trade receivables outstanding stood at Rs 18 crore as of March 31.
The company also stated that ALT
Digital
Media Entertainment has been valued at Rs 1,209 crore, reflecting a 32% premium over its carrying cost, according to a valuation exercise conducted by Balaji Telefilms through one of the Big Four independent valuation firms.
It added that the premium highlights the impact of the strategic changes implemented by ALT Digital over the past year.
Live Events
Reliance Industries
owns a 24.82% stake in Balaji Telefilms, with
Ektaa Kapoor
and
Shobha Kapoor
holding 18.16% and 10.84%, respectively.
As part of the strategic pivot, ALT Digital has undergone significant transformation, focusing on cost rationalisation, optimising staff levels and reducing cash burn.
ALT Digital reduced its EBITDA losses to Rs 21 crore in 2023-24 from Rs 65 crore in 2022-23 and Rs 135 crore in 2021-22. The company had liquid cash investments of Rs 20 crore in mutual funds as of March 31.
While ALTT continues to follow the subscription model, the platform has also ventured into the advertising segment. The platform has an order book exceeding Rs 230 crore for producing web-series for leading OTT platforms and syndication or content licensing agreements in place for about Rs 100 crore.
Balaji Telefilms reported a 6% year-on-year increase in consolidated revenue for 2023-24 to Rs 625 crore. Its net profit for Rs 19 crore against a net loss of Rs 37 crore in the previous fiscal.
In February, the company approved the composite scheme of arrangement to merge ALT Digital and Marinating Films with parent Balaji Telefilms.
During the fiscal, ALTT launched 18 new shows, taking its digital library to 126 shows. The platform sold about 1.28 million new subscriptions during the year.
The company’s films achieved a combined box office revenue of Rs 212 crore in 2023-24, representing a 23% increase year-on-year. Dream Girl 2 and Crew garnered about Rs 100 crore in box office revenue. It released five films during the year – three theatrical releases and two OTT releases.

Big TV shows look to rake in the moolah in festive season,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/big-tv-shows-look-to-rake-in-the-moolah-in-festive-season/articleshow/113173004.cms,09-09-2024,"Big impact
TV shows
like
Bigg Boss
and
Kaun Banega Crorepati
(KBC) are expecting an increase in
viewership
and
advertising
revenue during the festive period as there is no major cricket tournament scheduled during this period, said industry executives.
This year’s festive season does not have any major cricket tournaments like the ICC Cricket World Cup, and that has freed up advertising budgets for high-impact properties like KBC and Bigg Boss, they said.
Last year, the ICC Cricket World Cup, which took place in India, dominated both viewership and advertising spend during the festive period, leaving lesser budgets for non-cricket entertainment properties.
This year’s festive period's reality shows are expected to generate up to Rs 1,000 crore in advertising revenue, according to market estimates.
""We are seeing a lot of interest for impact programming across networks,"" said GroupM South Asia COO Ashwin Padmanabhan. ""We see a good response from brands on Big Boss across languages. KBC has probably seen the most advertiser interest in many years.""

According to Padmanabhan, the absence of a major cricket property and the improvement in consumer sentiment are fuelling demand for impact properties.
""Last year, a lot of festive-driven spending went into cricket. So all that money is going to be available,"" he said. “Secondly, promotions for August 15 and end-of-season sale in June-July performed well after two years, and rural consumption is expected to improve due to a good monsoon.”
Bigg Boss is one of the biggest properties if one looks at it comprehensively across TV and digital, with the show generating around 2.5 billion minutes of watch time across both platforms in the previous season, said Alok Jain, Viacom18 president, general entertainment.
""To put that into perspective, it's as if every person in India has spent at least two hours watching the show over the season. Outside of IPL, this is the largest property in Indian entertainment,"" he said.
Viacom18's head of network sales, Mahesh Shetty, said the company has successfully secured sponsorship deals and is in the midst of finalising more. He did not name any company.
""Bigg Boss continues to attract leading brands due to its ability to offer more than just standard ad placements. The show provides value through creative brand integrations,"" he said.
Ranjana Mangla, Sony LIV's head of ad sales, highlighted the significant value of large-scale reality shows like KBC, which span 142 days and create a market paradigm shift.
The festive season, from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali, is a critical period for the advertising and media industry. Advertisers strategically increase their marketing efforts during this period to capitalise on the surge in consumer demand.
Among the reality shows, first on the block was Viacom18's Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi, which had five sponsors, followed by Sony Pictures Networks India's KBC, which has more than 30 TV and digital sponsors.
Salman Khan-hosted Bigg Boss Hindi's 18th edition will start on October 5. Bigg Boss Marathi, which has Riteish Deshmukh as the host, debuted on July 28.

""We are planning collaborations with OTT platforms ahead of the upcoming festive season. Snacking and binging are directly related,"" said Vikram Agarwal, managing director of nachos maker Cornitos.
Packaged foods
maker
Nestle
has collaborated with Netflix for a co-branded campaign called 'Ultimate Break' for its KitKat chocolates. It involved KitKat launching Netflix co-branded packs and merchandise tie-up with Netflix shows Squid Game and Kota Factory. Among other such deals, gifting boutique Alluring Basket is pushing packs with 'Netflix & Chill' logos called 'Just one more Episode', which includes Pringles, KitKat and Coca-Cola.
Another such platform, Bean Tree Foods has also rolled out snacking packs that promote OTT binging and eating.
The deals are being structured on multiple models, and there are no set parameters, executives said.
""It can be profit-sharing on the basis of sales of the snacking brands, or free cross-promotions weaved into their respective advertising, or links that direct viewers to quick-commerce platforms where the snacking brands can be bought,"" an executive said.
Commenting on the deal with 4700BC, Poornima Sharma, head of marketing partnerships at Netflix India, in a statement said ""snacking while watching content has always been a tradition.""
While one-off such deals have been inked in the past, executives said there's a surge now on account of higher OTT numbers, which is directly proportional to higher internet penetration and adoption of
digital payments
.
An Internet in India report of 2023 estimated India's OTT streaming market at 707 million internet users last year, while the video-on-demand subscription market is expected to touch $2.77 billion by 2027.
One-off brand-OTT deals in the recent past include Mondelez's cookie brand Oreo tying up with Netflix's Stranger Things web series to launch Oreo Red Velvet, Coca-Cola's Thums Up signing up with Disney+ Hotstar for a campaign called Thums Up Fan Pulse, and
Marico
teaming up with Zee5 for Saffola masala oats.
Growth of ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook convenience foods, resurgence of regional and direct-to-consumer brands, and expansion of quick-commerce and ecommerce platforms that enable last-mile reach to even smaller markets are leading to double-digit growth in snacking, according to market research company IMARC Group. The firm estimated the Indian snacks market at ₹42,694.9 crore in 2023, and projected it to reach ₹95,521.8 crore in sales by 2032.

PIL to ban Netflix series 'IC 814-The Kandahar Hijack' withdrawn from Delhi High Court after Netflix's disclaimer,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pil-to-ban-netflix-series-ic-814-the-kandahar-hijack-withdrawn-from-delhi-high-court-after-netflixs-disclaimer/articleshow/113118514.cms,06-09-2024,"New Delhi [India], September 6 (ANI): The
PIL
seeking direction to ban Netflix's series ""
IC 814 The Kandahar Hijack
"" has been withdrawn from the
Delhi High Court
. The
petitioner
, through counsel, stated that Netflix's addition of a
disclaimer
clarifies the real names of the
terrorists
involved in the
hijacking
and addresses the concerns raised in the PIL.
Recently, the PIL was moved by Surjit Singh Yadav, Chief of Hindu Sena, to seek a ban on Netflix's series, namely ""IC 814 The Kandahar Hijack."" The PIL alleged that the series distorts the actual identities of the terrorists involved in the hijacking.
The petitioner through Advocate Shashi Ranjan has approched the court against the television miniseries ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack,"" directed by Anubhav Sinha, citing inaccuracies in its portrayal of the 1999 hijacking of Indian Flight 814.
The petition claimed that the miniseries erroneously assigns Hindu names such as ""Bhola"" and ""Shankar""--names associated with Lord Shiva--to the real hijackers Ibrahim Akhtar, Shahid Akhtar Sayeed, Sunny Ahmed Qazi, Zahoor Mistry, and Shakir.
This, according to the petitioner, distorts the identities of the hijackers, misrepresents historical events, perpetuates harmful stereotypes, and offends the sentiments of the Hindu community. The petitioner seeks the court's intervention to prevent further public misunderstanding and potential harm.

The plea mentioned that India's Constitution, which upholds secularism and religious harmony in a multi-religious society, mandates mutual respect for all religions as a fundamental right.
It asserts that film producers, directors, and actors have a constitutional duty to avoid disturbing religious feelings and sentiments. Consequently, the Cinematograph Act, 1952 was enacted by Parliament to regulate feature films and ensure they adhere to these principles. The plea seeks the court's intervention to address these concerns in the context of the miniseries ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack.""
The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has reportedly summoned Netflix's content head in response to accusations on social media that the makers of ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack"" deliberately altered the names of the hijackers to ""Bhola"" and ""Shankar.""
According to the reports, Netflix India's officials recently met with the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to address concerns about the series ""IC-814: The Kandahar Hijack."" Following the meeting, Netflix has committed to reviewing the series and updating the disclaimer to include the real names of the hijackers. Additionally, Netflix assured that future content on their platform will be more sensitive to national sentiments.

"Delhi HC grants relief to Vishesh Films, restrains T-Series from using 'Aashiqui' in film titles",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/delhi-hc-grants-relief-to-vishesh-films-restrains-t-series-from-using-aashiqui-in-film-titles/articleshow/113056063.cms,04-09-2024,"MUMBAI: The
Delhi High Court
has issued an interim injunction preventing Super Cassettes Industries, popularly known as
T-Series
, from releasing any film under the titles 'Tu Hi Aashiqui', '
Tu Hi Aashiqui Hai
', or any other name incorporating the term 'Aashiqui'.
This decision follows a petition filed by Vishesh Films, the co-producers of the original 'Aashiqui' films, aimed at protecting the well-established film franchise.
Justice Sanjeev Narula, who presided over the case, noted that the title 'Aashiqui' has evolved beyond a single-use term and is now an integral part of a recognised and successful film series.
The 'Aashiqui' franchise, which includes two highly successful films released in 1990 and 2013, holds significant brand value and is strongly associated with an ongoing series of films.
Justice Sanjeev Narula noted the potential overlap in production teams and highlighted media narratives that suggested the proposed T-Series film could be mistaken as part of the established 'Aashiqui' franchise. This potential confusion, even if temporary, could dilute the brand and diminish the distinctiveness of the 'Aashiqui' series.

""In light of the above, an interim injunction is granted in favor of the plaintiff (Vishesh Films), restraining the Defendant (T-Series/Super Cassettes), and/or anybody acting on their behalf, from using the title 'Tu Hi Aashiqui,' '
Tu Hi Aashiqui
Hai,' and/or any other name/title which uses the mark 'Aashiqui' in respect of their proposed film,"" the court ordered.
Justice Narula further stated, ""Trademark law is concerned with the initial likelihood of confusion, where the public might be misled into believing that there is an association between the T-Series film and the well-established
Aashiqui
franchise. This confusion, even if temporary, can cause significant harm by diluting the 'Aashiqui' brand.""
Vishesh Bhatt, Managing Director of Vishesh Films, expressed satisfaction with the court's ruling, stating, ""Our stance has been vindicated by this significant High Court judgment, which protects our beloved franchise brand and upholds our commitment to developing and nurturing our unique intellectual properties. This victory reinforces our dedication to innovation, creativity, and preserving the legacy of our brand, while also setting the right precedent for the entire entertainment industry.""
The court's decision follows extensive arguments from senior advocates representing both Vishesh Films and T-Series.
Vishesh Films, represented by Senior Advocate Sandeep Sethi, along with Pravin Anand and Dhruv Anand, argued that they hold joint ownership of all
intellectual property
and derivative rights associated with the 'Aashiqui' franchise, including any future installments.
The court concurred, emphasising the strong public association of the 'Aashiqui' mark with a continuing series of films, particularly in light of previous announcements about a potential third installment.

Directed by Anubhav Sinha and featuring a stellar cast of Vijay Varma, Patralekhaa, Pankaj Kapur, Naseeruddin Shah, Arvind Swamy, Dia Mirza, the series chronicles the true story of the December 1999 hijack.

As per an ANI report, the Netflix team attended a meeting with research documents and footage to support their new series. The materials are intended to demonstrate that the series aligns with publicly available resources. It will argue that the information in the series comes from books and official government statements.
A PIL has also been filed in the Delhi High Court seeking a ban on the mini-series.
About the IC814: The Kandahar Hijack
The Netflix series is based on the book 'Flight Into Fear: The Captain's Story,' written by journalist Srinjoy Chowdhury and Devi Sharan, who was the captain of the IC 814 flight. Indian Airlines Flight 814, traveling from Kathmandu to New Delhi, was hijacked on December 24, 1999, shortly after takeoff by five armed terrorists belonging to the Pakistan-based militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen.
The hijackers forced the plane to change its course multiple times, initially diverting it to Amritsar, India, then to Lahore, Pakistan, and later to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where 27 passengers were released, including a critically injured hostage who later succumbed to his injuries.
The series features an ensemble cast including Vijay Varma, Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapur, Manoj Pahwa, Arvind Swami, Anupam Tripathi, Dia Mirza, Patralekhaa, Amrita Puri, Dibyendu Bhattacharya, and Kumud Mishra in key roles.

BJP
's
Amit Malviya
starkly called out Anubhav Sinha for 'legitimising' their criminal intent by ""furthering their non-Muslim names"".
""Decades later, people will think Hindus hijacked IC-814. Left’s agenda to whitewash the crimes of Pakistani terrorists, all Muslims, served. This is the power of cinema, which the Communists have been using aggressively, since the 70s. Perhaps even earlier.,"" Malviya alleged.
BJP MP Kangana Ranaut, too, noted that one can show unimaginable amount of violence and nudity on OTT platforms without any consequence or censorship.
""...one can even distort real life events to suit their politically motivated sinister motives, there is all the freedom for communists or leftists across the world for such anti national expressions but as a nationalist no OTT platform allows us to make films that revolves around the integrity and unity of Bharat, it seems censorship is only for some of us who don’t want tukde of this nation and make films on historic facts. It’s hugely demotivating and unjust,"" she said on X.
About the IC814: The Kandahar Hijack
The Netflix series is based on the book 'Flight Into Fear: The Captain's Story,' written by journalist Srinjoy Chowdhury and Devi Sharan, who was the captain of the IC 814 flight. Indian Airlines Flight 814, traveling from Kathmandu to New Delhi, was hijacked on December 24, 1999, shortly after takeoff by five armed terrorists belonging to the Pakistan-based militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen.
The hijackers forced the plane to change its course multiple times, initially diverting it to Amritsar, India, then to Lahore, Pakistan, and later to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where 27 passengers were released, including a critically injured hostage who later succumbed to his injuries.
The series features an ensemble cast including Vijay Varma, Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapur, Manoj Pahwa, Arvind Swami, Anupam Tripathi, Dia Mirza, Patralekhaa, Amrita Puri, Dibyendu Bhattacharya, and Kumud Mishra in key roles.

"After Airtel deal, Apple set for music, TV streaming fight in India",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/after-airtel-deal-apple-set-for-music-tv-streaming-fight-in-india/articleshow/112979841.cms,02-09-2024,"Apple
's partnership with
India
's second-biggest telecoms firm will give the iPhone maker a sorely needed boost in a content market where it lags far behind the likes of
Spotify
and
Walt Disney
.
The U.S. technology giant, working to boost revenue globally from services including apps, payments and media, is set to offer free music and video streaming to many of Bharti
Airtel
's 281 million customers.
The deal is likely to greatly expand the user base for Apple TV+ and Apple Music in a country where Apple has long emphasised the manufacturing side of business to diversify its supply chain beyond China.
Apple builds many of its iPhones in India yet its handsets make up just 6% of the country's 690 million smartphones, versus around 2% in 2019, Counterpoint Research data showed.
""The move speaks of Apple's ambitions for India,"" said Nitesh Kripalani, former head of Amazon Prime Video in India. ""The strategy is a time-tested method to catapult presence in markets it considers important.""
Live Events
In the U.S., Apple has offered Apple Music for free via some Verizon mobile data plans since 2019, and its Apple TV+ will feature in a Comcast streaming bundle from May.
In India, Apple Music will become available to premium users of
Airtel
's Wynk music app, which will eventually close.
Postpaid Airtel contracts give about 7 million subscribers access to the ad-free version of Wynk but only a small fraction use it, said a telecom industry source who declined to be named as the figures are confidential.
Neither Apple nor Airtel responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.
MUSIC BATTLEGROUND
Apple Music is more tailored to the Indian market compared with the mostly English Apple TV+ with content including Bollywood and regional-language songs, though its library is smaller than Spotify's, said Counterpoint co-founder Neil Shah.
Spotify has some 3 million paid users in India, Gaana has 1.4 million, Wynk 500,000 and Apple Music 200,000, said an Indian music industry source who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to share estimates publicly.
Neither Spotify nor Gaana responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.
Overall, only around 7.5 million people paid for audio streaming services in India last year out of about 185 million users of ad-supported and ad-free apps, showed data from industry group FICCI and consultants EY.
Airtel will pay Apple a per-user fee ""significantly"" lower than the monthly $1.20 charged each for Apple TV+ and Apple Music in India, said the telecom industry source.
In return, it will save millions of rupees in licensing as it looks to shut Wynk and use Apple Music to boost revenue and improve customer loyalty, said a second telecom source
""Airtel realised its strength is distribution, not content creation,"" said the source on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to discuss the matter.
VIDEO STREAMING
Apple is a small player in Indian video streaming, with Counterpoint estimating it has fewer than 1 million users. Disney+ Hotstar is the market leader with 38 million users, while estimates showed Netflix has around 10 million.
Hinting at the market's potential, Netflix has repeatedly said it targets 100 million users, without fixing a time frame.
Apple TV+ is known for original series such as ""The Morning Show"" and ""Slow Horses"" however rivals including Netflix and
Disney
feature more Hindi content with Bollywood actors and even regional-language films.
Disney and
Reliance Industries
' JioCinema also stream cricket - India's most popular sport - and the two companies are merging their Indian media assets to create the nation's biggest entertainment firm.
Airtel, which as telecoms provider lags only Reliance Jio by subscribers, plans to offer packages with several months' free access to Apple TV+, said the second telecoms source.
Though that will get Apple TV+ into more homes, growth could be hindered as its ""offering is still not optimised locally that much,"" said Counterpoint's Shah.

'First-of-its-kind' space travel reality series to get $50 million from Banijay Asia,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/first-of-its-kind-space-travel-reality-series-to-get-50-million-from-banijay-asia/articleshow/112974574.cms,02-09-2024,"Banijay Asia
plans to invest $50 million (about Rs 400 crore) in a first-of-its-kind
reality series
, tentatively titled '
Race to Space
', making it the country's most expensive show so far, said people close to the development.
The investment will cover licensing fee payments to US-based
Space Exploration and Research Agency
(SERA), as well as production and talent costs, the people said. Banijay is launching the series in partnership with SERA.
""Given the scale and scope of the project, this is not just a documentary series or just a reality series; it is a space programme, which is a multimedia event across ground, across platforms, live, and space. Together, we’d plan a budget that would be commensurate in line with creating the best-in-class experience for the viewers,"" said Banijay Asia CEO Deepak Dhar. He didn’t elaborate.
Dhar said the new reality format will revolutionise competitive reality television and rekindle interest in space exploration.
Currently, Bigg Boss Hindi, hosted by Bollywood star
Salman Khan
, is the most expensive non-fiction format with budgets exceeding Rs 150 crore, say industry watchers. Sony Entertainment Television's (SET) Kaun Banega Crorepati, hosted by Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan, also has budgets in excess of Rs 100 crore, they added.
Live Events
SERA cofounder Joshua Skurla expressed optimism about the success of the show in India, citing strong interest in the country during the livestreaming of Chandrayaan-3 landing on the Moon last year.
""India is the first market where we have collaborated to produce a series of this nature. Similar collaborations are currently in the works in other markets,"" he added.
Fascination in outer space peaked last year in India, with the touchdown of Chandrayaan-3's lander module becoming the most-watched event on YouTube with 8 million concurrent viewers. Over 70 million viewers watched the Chandrayaan-3 landing in total.
The series will showcase the emotions of shortlisted individuals overcoming challenges to become one of the first Indian citizens to travel to space using Blue Origin's New Shepard reusable suborbital rocket.
The chosen astronauts will embark on an 11-minute journey past the Kármán line, the internationally recognised boundary of space. The series will be produced in India, and at the Huntsville, Alabama, Space Centre.
Registrations for participating in the show have already commenced. The series is open to all Indian citizens.
Indian viewers will have the opportunity to vote for a candidate best suited to go on a space journey among those shortlisted.
Banijay is in talks with multiple streaming platforms for licensing the show.
""It’s something that both of us are still exploring. Given that something like this hasn’t been done before, it gives us the freedom to think beyond the conventional revenue-generating routes—not limited to broadcasters, advertorials, sponsors, and live partnerships, among other avenues,"" said Dhar.
SERA aims to democratise space travel by providing six seats worldwide for citizens on the New Shepard mission. SERA and Blue Origin recently roped in India as partner countries to launch a human spaceflight programme.

"No power group, but 'strong alliances' are there in film industry: FEFKA gen secy",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/no-power-group-but-strong-alliances-are-there-in-film-industry-fefka-gen-secy/articleshow/112965993.cms,01-09-2024,"B Unnikrishnan, general secretary of the Film Employees Federation of Kerala (
FEFKA
), on Sunday said there were ""strong
alliances
"" in the
cinema industry
, but he was not aware of any ""
power group
"" as mentioned in the Justice K Hema Committee report. Unnikrishnan, speaking to a TV channel, said that it was an ""undeniable fact"" that there were ""strong alliances"" of some production houses with certain directors, writers and actors to make big films.
""They often work together on several projects back-to-back and naturally, everyone would try to align themselves with them to get opportunities. However, such alliances are based on commercial interests,"" he said.
He also said that such alliances were not confined to
Malayalam cinema
alone and were present in film industries everywhere.
At the same time, he said that there cannot be a secret lobby of different cinema-related organisations which meet periodically to decide who should be isolated from films.
""The industry will not be able to work like that,"" he said in response to queries about whether there was a ""power group"" in the film sector.

On whether the response of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) to the committee report was delayed, Unnikrishnan said that it was not late, but what they said was criticised by the general public.
""They (AMMA) should be ready to accept that criticism and learn from it,"" he said.
He also said that the present crisis in AMMA was due to the fact that it was not a trade union like organisation and has a loose structure.
They lack the ""experience and flexibility"" to deal with the issues that were mentioned in the Hema Committee report, he further said.
""If they had a trade union like structure or system, all this would not have happened,"" he added.
The Justice K Hema Committee was constituted by the Kerala government after the 2017 actress assault case, and its report revealed instances of harassment and exploitation of women in the Malayalam cinema industry.
Regarding director Vinayan's complaint to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to remove him (Unnikrishnan) from the cinema policy making committee, the FEFKA general secretary said there was no need to keep him away from the panel.
""I am in the panel as the general secretary of FEFKA representing people of 21 crafts or trade unions and not as an individual. What I say there will be the opinion of those 21 trade unions. So, I see no requirement to remove me from the committee,"" he said.
Vinayan has sought Unnikrishnan's removal from the panel on the grounds that he had been penalised by the Competition Commission of India for unfair trade practices.
The CCI order had come on Vinayan's complaint.

Jayasurya
has vehemently denied recent
sexual harassment allegations
leveled against him, stating that the accusations have caused immense distress to him and his family. Currently in the United States, Jayasurya asserted that he will address the claims legally, with his lawyers handling the matter until his return.
""Due to my personal commitments, my family and I have been in America for the past one month, and during this time, two false allegations on the grounds of sexual harassment were made against me. Quite naturally, it has shattered me, my family and everyone who has held me close. I have decided to move forward with this legally,"" Jayasurya wrote in a note on his Facebook page, thanking those who wished him a happy birthday on August 31.
The first First Information Report (FIR) against Jayasurya was lodged on August 28, citing section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which pertains to assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty. This complaint, filed at the Cantonment police station by a female actor who has appeared in several movies, implicated not just Jayasurya but also other prominent actors like M Mukesh, who is also an MLA, Maniyanpilla Raju, and Idavela Babu, a notable figure in the actors' association,
AMMA
.
""In 2013, I was subjected to physical and verbal abuse by these individuals while working on a project. I tried to cooperate and continue working, but the abuse became unbearable,"" the complainant stated in a Facebook post.
The second FIR was registered at Karamana police station, involving sections 354 and 354 C (voyeurism) of the IPC. This complaint by another female actor alleged that Jayasurya molested her on a movie set near Thodupuzha during 2012-2013.

Radhika Sarathkumar alleges hidden cameras used inside caravans of actresses on Malayalam film set
Reacting to these allegations, Jayasurya, in his Facebook note, said, ""False allegations are easy to make for anyone who lacks a conscience. I only hope one realises that facing a false accusation of harassment is just as painful as the harassment itself. A lie always travels faster than the truth, but I believe truth will prevail.""
Jayasurya stated that he will return to Kerala once his work in the United States is completed and assured that all legal proceedings to prove his innocence will continue in the meantime. ""I have complete faith in our judicial system,"" he emphasized, adding sarcastically, ""Let those who have not sinned throw stones, but only at those who have sinned."" He also expressed his gratitude to ""those who contributed to making this birthday the most painful one.""
These allegations come in the wake of the recently revealed
Justice K Hema Committee
report, which has triggered a series of FIRs against high-profile Malayalam film personalities. The report, made public on August 19, sheds light on numerous instances of harassment and exploitation of women within the
Malayalam cinema industry
.
Following the report, besides Jayasurya, other film personalities facing similar accusations include actors Sidhique, Mukesh, Maniyanpilla Raju, Idavela Babu, and director Ranjith.

The swirl of allegations and subsequent legal actions mark a significant moment of reckoning for the Malayalam cinema industry, with multiple prominent figures now under scrutiny. As the cases unfold, the impacted individuals and the broader industry are likely to face intense public and legal examination.
Jayasurya’s efforts to clear his name underscore the intense personal and professional challenges such allegations entail. The outcome of these legal battles will be closely watched, offering potential precedent and lessons for addressing such serious charges in the entertainment industry and beyond.
The situation highlights the broader context of the challenges women face in the film industry, as well as the imperative for legal and institutional frameworks to address and resolve accusations of harassment responsibly and justly.

PVR INOX
plans to close 70 non-performing
screens
in FY25 and will go for potential
monetisation
of non-core
real estate assets
in prime locations such as Mumbai, Pune, and Vadodara, according to its latest annual report. Though the company will add 120 new screens in FY25, it will also close almost 60-70 non-performing screens, as it chases for profitable
growth
.
About 40 per cent of new screens addition will come from
South India
, where it will have a ""strategic focus"" on this lesser penetrated region as per its medium to long-term strategy.
Moreover,
PVR INOX
is redefining its growth strategy by transitioning towards a capital-light growth model to reduce its
capex
on new screens addition by 25 to 30 per cent in the current fiscal.
Now, PVR INOX will partner with developers to jointly invest in new screen capex by shifting towards a franchise-owned and company-operated (FOCO) model.
It is also evaluating monetisation of owned real estate assets, as the leading film exhibitor aims to become ""net-debt free"" company in the foreseeable future.

""This involves a potential monetisation of our non-core real estate assets in prime locations such as Mumbai, Pune, and Vadodara,"" said Managing Director Ajay Kumar Bijli and Executive Director Sanjeev Kumar addressing the shareholders of the company.
In terms of growth, they said the focus is to speed up expansion in underrepresented markets.
""Our company's medium to long-term strategy will involve expanding the number of screens in South India due to the region's high demand for films and comparatively low number of multiplexes in comparison to other regions. We estimate that approximately 40 per cent of our total screen additions will come from South India,"" they said.
During the year, PVR INOX opened 130 new screens across 25 cinemas and also shut down 85 under-performing screens across 24 cinemas in line with its strategy of profitable growth.
""This rationalisation is part of our ongoing efforts to optimise our portfolio. The number of closures seems high because we are doing it for the first time as a combined entity,"" said Bijli.
PVR INOX's
net debt
in FY24 was at Rs 1,294 crore. The company had reduced its net debt by Rs 136.4 crore last fiscal, said CFO Gaurav Sharma.
""Even though we are cutting down on capital expenditure, we are not compromising on growth and will open almost 110-120 screens in FY25. At the same time, not wavering from our goal of profitable growth, we will exit almost 60-70 screens that are non-performing and a drag on our profitability,"" he said.
In FY24, PVR's revenue was at Rs 6,203.7 crore and it reported a loss of Rs 114.3 crore. This was the first full year of operations of the merged entity PVR INOX.
Over the progress on merger integration, Bijli said ""80-90 per cent of the targeted synergies was achieved in 2023-24""
In FY24, PVR INOX had a 10 per cent growth in ticket prices and 11 per cent in F&B spend per head, which was ""higher-than-normal"". This was primarily on account of merger synergies on the integration of PVR and INOX, said Sharma.
""Going forward, the increase in ticket prices and food and beverage spending per head will be more in line with the long-term historical growth rates,"" he said.
PVR INOX aims to restore pre-pandemic operating margins, enhancing return on capital, and driving free cash flow generation.
""We aim to boost revenue by increasing footfalls through innovative customer acquisition and retention,"" said Sharma adding ""We are also driving cost efficiencies by renegotiating rental contracts, closing under-performing screens, adopting a leaner organisational structure, and controlling overhead costs.""

. There were political and film representatives from Southeast Asia, West Asia, Africa, South America and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Recep Erdogan’s Turkey—where Russia is building a nuclear power plant and whose hyperemotional dramas are devoured by millions around the world—was possibly the only NATO member that was represented at the festival week.
In Moscow where one of the greatest communists, VI Lenin, lies in a mausoleum that is a bell’s peal away from golddomed churches, incongruities come together like the twisted, many-shaped, multicoloured domes of St Basil’s Cathedral. In this city, warming under a late August sun, what could MIFW possibly mean? When asked if this is the beginning of a cultural grouping against the US, Yuliana Slashcheva, CEO of Gorky Film Studio and head of SMF Animation, told ET, “This has never happened before. They have forced us now. Their domination is getting stronger and stronger, and we need to counter it. For that we need to unite our talents, competencies and resources. For example, if we unite China, India and Russia, we will be stronger.”
This move towards a new movie entente comes against the backdrop of economic sanctions and a cultural boycott by the West. According to a Reuters report in March, about 1,000 foreign companies have exited Russia, suffering losses of about $107 billion. Meanwhile, Muscovites say their own firms have stepped in, particularly in sectors like food and fashion, that they don’t feel any difference.
Alexey Fursin, head of the department of culture of the City of Moscow, says the share of domestic brands in the Russian market has gone up from 56% in 2021 to 72% in 2023. According to a presentation by him, Uniqlo, H&M and Zara have been substituted by local brands and retail chains such as Zarina, Befree and Trend Island. Can content be similarly and easily substituted? The big American movie distributors have left Russia. The FIAPF, which is the International Federation of Film Producers Associations, has paused accreditation to the Moscow International Film Festival. Meanwhile, the share of domestic movies in the Russian cinema market went up from 22% in 2019 to 72% in 2023. Now, Moscow is trying to not just fill a gap but to prove that it can create a cultural world that is not dominated or dictated by the US.

Says Slashcheva: “Russia did not close its market to the US. They left. Almost all major studios have stopped distribution even though independent studios and distributors still send their content. They are making a big mistake. They are giving us a huge opportunity to grow. In 10 years, especially if we collaborate with industries in India, China and Latin America, we will be very, very strong.”
THOSE AWAARA DAYS
Moscow is tapping into the past glory of Soviet cinema and the current geopolitics to craft a future. The MIFW began with the Russian premiere of Laapataa Ladies at the celebrated cinema hall Khudozhestvenny where Sergei Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin had one of its earliest screenings.
In an email interaction with ET, Fursin recalls Raj Kapoor: “The association between Indian cinema and Russia is indeed storied, with Raj Kapoor’s films holding a special place in the hearts of Russian audiences. His work resonated deeply, symbolising the cultural and emotional connection between our nations. We are committed to reviving this association through the Moscow International Film Week.”
It is an association that goes back 70 years. It was in September 1954, a year after Josef Stalin’s death, that the first Indian film festival opened in the Soviet Union. There were movies like Awaara, Do Bigha Zamin, Rahi and Aandhiyan.
KA Abbas, the Marxist writer-filmmaker, was the behindthe-scenes cultural conduit. He adapted Maxim Gorky’s play Lower Depths for Chetan Anand’s Neecha Nagar in 1946, which went to—and won at— Cannes. Abbas then wrote the story and screenplay for Kapoor’s Awaara, which took the USSR by storm.
In Sudha Rajagopalan’s Indian Films in Soviet Cinemas, Igor Belotserkovskii, a Ukrainian living in Moscow, recalls how his entire village turned up to watch Indian movies. “The houses in our village were at quite a distance from each other so the postman cycled from door to door, announcing, ‘Today! Indian film show!’” People rushed to get a seat at the film club. When the seats were filled, they lined up ladders against the wall and sat on the rungs. Some brought their own chairs. The “windows were opened so that people could watch the film while perched on their car-roofs.... Speakers were placed outside the club so that those on the street could follow the film’s dialogue and music.” The songs resounded throughout the village, he says. Rajagopalan estimates that Awaara was watched by 63.7 million people in the USSR. Between 1954 and 1991, when the Soviet Union fell, about 210 Indian films were screened.
QUIET FLOWS THE MOSKVA
That euphoria belongs to a different time and generation. Moscow is aware that this moment is vastly different from the Soviet sun under which Kapoor sang and Mithun Chakraborti discoed and Geeta and Seeta separated. The Indian cinema is in a different place, having danced Naatu naatu at the Oscars and won the Grand Prix for All We Imagine as Light at Cannes. “When the Soviet Union was divided and Russia stepped into the market economy, the state suddenly stopped financing our film industry. There was no time to transition,” says Slashcheva.
“Meanwhile, the Indian film industry was smoothly developing. It did not have to suffer the economic changes that downshifted the Russian film industry. The Indian movie industry has become huge and we need to catch up. These kinds of events can lead to possible collaborations,” she adds.
Moscow wants to roll out the red carpet for filmmakers—financial incentives and infrastructure that includes a 1,000-hectare film city that is being developed called the Moskino Film Park. “Our primary objective is to create a platform where filmmakers from around the world can connect, collaborate and celebrate cinema. We remain committed to engaging with the global film community and demonstrating Moscow’s role as a leading centre for cinematic innovation,” says Fursin, who hopes this will also lead to a significant number of tourists trooping into the capital. While film parks and film cities run the risk of becoming anachronistic in the age of AI, MIFW remains gung-ho about them—from the Hengdian World Studios and QingDao Movie Studio in China to the Mumbai Film City and the Ramoji Film City in India.
Away from the big Hindi movies and art-house films from Kerala and Bengal that lit up the Soviet screens, it is the Telugu industry that is now getting ready for a show. Priyanka and Swapna Dutt, coproducers of Kalki 2898 AD, say they will be releasing a dubbed version of the film in Russia in September.
Moscow remains nonchalant. As the Moskva flows quietly under bridges that look like hanging gardens of blue and purple flowers, teenagers zip past on escooters, people swipe Mir cards instead of Mastercard and youngsters move to Livin’ la vida loca. Here, Ukrainian Night is a black-and-gold Kuinji painting that glows in the Tretyakov Gallery and the only Kiev that is publicly mentioned is bread-crumbed, uncontroversial and begins with a bird’s name.

Zee files application seeking recall of NCLT order sanctioning merger with Sony,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-files-application-seeking-recall-of-nclt-order-sanctioning-merger-with-sony/articleshow/112933759.cms,30-08-2024,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises
has filed an application with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking the recall of the tribunal's August 10, 2023 order, which sanctioned the
merger
scheme with Sony Group Corporation's India media units,
Culver Max Entertainment
and Bangla Entertainment.
The Indian entertainment giant filed the application with the Mumbai bench of the NCLT on August 29, according to its regulatory filing.
Furthermore, on August 30, Zee withdrew its application and relinquished its rights to file claims/counterclaims before the arbitral tribunal constituted in the arbitration proceedings related to the merger cooperation agreement dated December 22, 2021.
The arbitration proceedings were initiated by Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment before the SIAC. Zee contested the Sony-owned companies' claim of a $90 million termination fee for the non-fulfillment of the merger scheme.
""Accordingly, the scheme cannot be made effective in terms thereof,"" Zee said in the regulatory filing.

The merger deal, two years in the making, was called off by Sony due to Zee's failure to meet the merger closing conditions. Leadership of the combined entity was another sticking point between the two companies.
Following the termination of the deal, Zee filed an application before the NCLT, seeking directions for Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment to implement the merger deal. In June, the NCLT permitted Zee to withdraw its application.
In May, Zee had also announced the termination of the merger deal with Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment and demanded a $90 million termination fee from both companies.
Under the merger agreement signed in December 2021, Sony would have held 50.86% of the new company, while other Zee shareholders would have owned a 45.15% stake. Zee founders would have held a 3.99% stake in the combined entity.
Sony had also pledged to infuse $1.5 billion into the merged entity.

Khan’s entry into the prestigious list is noted because of his financial achievements beyond the silver screen. His ownership in the Kolkata Knight Riders, which won the IPL title last season, and Red Chillies Entertainment, his production house, have significantly contributed to his growing wealth.

rape case
has been registered against
Malayalam actor Sidhique
following a female actor's allegation that he sexually assaulted her in 2016, police said on Wednesday.
An
FIR
under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) has been registered against the actor at Museum police station, a senior police officer said. The case was registered under the IPC as the offence allegedly occurred in 2016. This is the second FIR against a high profile film personality following the allegations of sexual harassment against various directors and actors in the wake of revelations in the
Justice Hema Committee
report.
The first case, under IPC Section 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty), was against director Ranjith on a complaint by a female actor from West Bengal regarding an incident which occurred in 2009. She had alleged that the director had touched her inappropriately with sexual intent after inviting her to act in the movie Paleri Manikyam in 2009.
Following the allegation by the actor, Ranjith had resigned from his post as chairman of Kerala Chalachitra Academy.
Sidhique had also resigned from his post as general secretary of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) following the allegations against him. The Justice Hema Committee was constituted by the Kerala government after the 2017 actress assault case and its report revealing instances of harassment and exploitation of women in the Malayalam cinema industry.

Bharti Airtel partners with Apple to offer exclusive access to Apple TV+ content and Apple Music
Two sources familiar with the strategy said that for Apple, the deal is aimed at reaching out to a much bigger pool of consumers with its digital services given Airtel is the country's second biggest telecom operator with 281 million subscribers.
Ambani's Reliance Jio telecom service has 489 million users.
The Apple TV+ streaming service, known for its original series like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show and Slow Horses, has so far differentiated itself in the streaming landscape with a focus on in-house content.
Most rival platforms in India and overseas offer users older movies and TV shows from other studios, as well as their own originals.
Airtel will within days announce new tariff plans that will include free Apple TV+ offerings, said two other sources with direct knowledge of its plans.
Currently, the Apple TV+ service retails at $9.99 per month in the U.S. and 99 Indian rupees ($1.18) per month in India, compared to Ambani's JioCinema which offers cricket content for free and has plans as cheap as 29 rupees a month. Netflix starts with monthly tariff of 149 rupees.
Cricket is seen as a way to attract more customers to streaming platforms in India, and Disney
lost millions of Indian users
last year when it lost streaming
rights to Ambani's Reliance
for streaming the world's richest cricket tournament, the Indian Premier League.
Apple has 6% of India's 690 million smartphone users, according to data from research firm Counterpoint. The remaining market is dominated by phones from Samsung and Xiaomi, and are powered by Google's Android operating system.
Apple Music is currently priced at 99 Indian rupees per month and has a library of 100 million songs.

"Airtel to shut down Wynk Music, offer Apple Music to users",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/airtel-to-shut-down-wynk-music-offer-apple-music-to-users/articleshow/112845937.cms,28-08-2024,"Bharti Airtel
is shutting down its
music streaming
business,
Wynk Music
, after 10 years and the latter's more than 100 million
customers
are set to initially become
Apple Music
subscribers for a limited free trial period, multiple people aware of the matter said.
Post the free trial period, these erstwhile
Wynk
customers will be given the option to become full-fledged paying customers of
Apple
Music, the music streaming service of Cupertino-based Apple.
The move is seen as a win-win for both sides-for Airtel, as it wasn't able to scale up its music streaming business in the face of the dominance of
YouTube
, while the services business of Apple, a big revenue driver globally, hasn't picked up much in India, and the deal offers a potential
subscriber base
of more than 100 million Wynk users, say analysts.
""After launching and operating the music platform for 10 years and serving 100+ million customers, Wynk will cease to exist as a standalone entity,""
Airtel
said in an internal mass mailer to Wynk customers.
ET has a seen a copy of Airtel's communication. At press time, ET's queries to
Airtel
and Apple went unanswered.
Live Events
Wynk is part of Airtel's digital services business and generates roughly ₹250-to-₹300 crore in annual revenue for the telco.
In its communique to Wynk Music customers, Airtel added that it has entered into ""a strategic partnership with Apple"" as there was a need to have global scale and reach for sustainability reasons. A senior Airtel executive said that the 70-to-80-odd Wynk employees would be absorbed in the Airtel system.
Earlier this year, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal had told ET that the telco hadn't done particularly well in the music (streaming) business as people in India don't like paying for music, and want it free. He had bemoaned the fact that while Wynk had a lot of customers, they don't pay (read: generate meaningful revenue), and its subscription model had not done well. He had added that almost no one in the (music streaming) industry had done well with the exception of specialised companies like YouTube.
Accordingly, Airtel's decision to 'sunset' the Wynk music business makes sense amid continuing monetisation challenges, say industry experts.
However, under the broad commercial pact between Apple and Airtel, Airtel mobile users-on both the prepaid and postpaid platforms-will have exclusive access to Apple Music and Apple TV+ offerings later this year. The modalities are being worked out.
Airtel, in fact, has partnered with Apple to integrate Apple Music and Apple TV+ as part of the telco's consumer offerings.
Apple-Airtel Partnership
Airtel, in fact, has partnered with Apple to integrate Apple Music and Apple TV+ as part of the telco’s consumer offerings. The pact also comes amid a surge in consumption of video content in the country.
In its mass mailer, the telco said all Airtel users would have access to Apple Music. In addition, Wynk Premium users would receive exclusive offers and enjoy access to an even bigger and better music catalog on Apple Music, the telco said in the internal mailer.
By contrast, the prospect of potentially acquiring over 100 million paying customers from Wynk after the free-trial period is a win-win for Apple, especially for rapidly growing its music streaming business in India and boosting revenue, a person aware of the Apple-Airtel discussions said.
Analysts added that for Apple, the services segment has been the strongest growth driver globally with revenues growing in double-digits. The iPhone maker raked in $24,213 million from services globally in the April-June quarter 2024. Most of such services revenues, though, have come from developed economies.
“But with India being one of the fastest growing markets for the iPhone maker, and as the installed base of iPhones rises in the country, Apple would look to grow its services business as well,” Varun Mishra, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, said
From that perspective, Mishra feels bundling of services is a good strategy. “It would help consumers experience Apple’s key services portfolio without having to pay an individual subscription fee, thus removing an entry barrier.”
Industry experts added that rising penetration of OTT, Smart TV and broadband services would also lead to synergies. “Current attach rates for Apple services in India should be low and revenues miniscule in terms of global context, but this (read: services business) is a good long term growth avenue,” said Counterpoint’s Mishra.

The settlement also includes withdrawing all claims for the $90 million termination fee, damages, litigation and other costs incurred, and all claims for costs of disposition hive-off, spin-off, winding-up, liquidation, closure of business and or any other assets.
Earlier in April, Zee Entertainment Limited (ZEE) had announced that it has decided to withdraw the merger implementation application filed National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai bench against Culver Max Entertainment (Sony).
The Puneet Goenka-led company had also said that the decision will allow it ""to continue to aggressively pursue"" all of its claims against Sony in the course of the ongoing arbitration proceedings at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and in other forums.
The Zee-Sony merger
On August 10, 2023, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT approved ZEEL's plan to merge with BEPL and Culver Max Entertainment, two Sony group companies. This merger could have resulted in the creation of a media company valued at USD 10 billion.
The merger was called off by Sony on January 22. Zee's inability to meet certain financial terms of the agreement and devise a strategy to rectify them contributed to the decision to make the change. In response to the accusations, Zed said that the Japanese company had acted in ""bad faith"" when it called off the merger.
The largest entertainment network in the nation would have been created if the Sony-Zee merger had gone through, owning over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV), and two movie studios (Zed Studios and Sony Pictures Films India).

Jio Studios
, which has at least ₹2,000 crore invested in content at any given point in time, is a profitable business, a top official told ET. The content arm of
Reliance Industries
(RIL) also intends to beat its FY24 box-office collections of ₹700 crore in FY25.
Stree 2
, a joint production between Jio Studios and Maddock Films, has already grossed over ₹500 crore globally, including ₹426 crore from India. The horror comedy film, which was produced at a cost of over ₹100 crore, has delivered a net box office collection of ₹361 crore.
At a time when the film industry is struggling to deliver big hits, Jio Studios has delivered major hits in FY24, including Zara Hatke Zara Bachke, Article 370, Laapataa Ladies, and Shaitaan, besides Marathi movies Baipan Bhari Deva and Jhimma 2. ""At any point in time, we have at least ₹2,000 crore invested in content,"" said RIL president, media business Jyoti Deshpande, adding, ""It's (Jio Studios) a profitable business; we are ploughing back our free cash flow back into the business.""
She also said that the studio will now focus on tent poles, consolidating its market leadership, and building franchises like Stree, Singham, and Son of Sardaar.
It will also focus more on theatrical releases rather than direct to digital releases as the streaming market has cooled down due to pressure on reducing costs and having a well-defined path to profitability.

Of late, Viacom18 has been beefing up its leadership team at JioCinema. The company has appointed Prime Video India country director Sushant Sreeram and YouTube India head Ishan Chatterjee as chief marketing officer and chief revenue officer, respectively, at JioCinema.
As reported by ET earlier, the company is also willing to shut channels across Hindi and regional markets to alleviate concerns of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) about the market dominance of the proposed Star-Viacom18 merged entity.
The companies are awaiting CCI and National Company Law Tribunals (NCLT) approvals.
According to RIL's annual report, JioCinema had an average monthly reach of 225 million users. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney+ Hotstar had 333 million monthly active users, as per Sensor Tower.
Disney+ Hotstar had 35.5 million paid subscribers in June, which is significantly lower than the 61 million that the platform used to enjoy at its peak when it also had content such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and HBO.
Earlier, RIL-controlled Viacom18 had merged its OTT platforms under the Voot brand with JioCinema. Viacom18 had three OTT platforms--Voot, Voot Select and Voot Kids.
Prior to that, JioCinema was transferred to Viacom18 through an NCLT sanctioned scheme of arrangement that also involved RIL and Bodhi Tree Systems infusing Rs 15,145 crore in Viacom18.
Both Disney and RIL declined to comment.
A second person aware of the development said having a single OTT platform will help in saving costs and building a one-stop OTT destination that will give strong competition to YouTube in the advertising video on demand (AVOD) segment and Netflix and Prime Video in the subscription VOD segment.
""Having two OTT platforms is pointless as it will result in more expenses,"" the person added.
Once Disney+ Hotstar merges with JioCinema, the latter will become the top streaming app in the country with the largest repository of entertainment, sports, and Hollywood content, comprising over 125,000 hours.
It will also have key cricket rights, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), as well as content from Disney, HBO, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global.
""Record viewership of the Indian Premier League on JioCinema underscored our ability to scale up audiences on our digital platform in a short time,"" RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani had said in the company's annual report.
As reported by ET recently, Disney+, Hotstar, and JioCinema have been valued higher than their parent companies' linear TV businesses. Disney+ Hotstar was valued at Rs 16,040 crore, while JioCinema was transferred to a Viacom 18 subsidiary for a consideration of Rs 24,186 crore.

'Stree 2' tops charts with over ₹100 cr box office collections,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/stree-2-tops-charts-with-over-100-cr-box-office-collections/articleshow/112595721.cms,18-08-2024,"Stree 2
, a Hindi horror comedy film, emerged as one of the biggest hits of 2024, grossing more than Rs 100 crore in just two days of release on August 15.
The film, a co-production between
Maddock Films
and
Jio Studios
, brought in a total of Rs 118 crore in gross receipts at the box office on Thursday and Friday. Net collections were Rs 100.1 crore.
Stree 2 is the fifth installment in the Maddock Supernatural Universe, a sequel to the 2018 movie Stree. It features
Rajkummar Rao
,
Shraddha Kapoor
,
Pankaj Tripathi
, Abhishek Banerjee, and Aparshakti Khurana.
Apart from Stree 2, cinema exhibitors anticipated films like Khel Khel Mein, Vedaa, Thangalaan, and Double iSmart to perform well, but they did not meet their expectations. All these films were released on August 15.
According to data from box office tracker Sacnilk, Akshay Kumar-starrer comedy film Khel Khel Mein and John Abraham's action-thriller Vedaa have garnered Rs 7.1 crore and Rs 8.1 crore, respectively, in net domestic box office collections on the first two days.
Live Events
Tamil action adventure Thangalaan and Telugu sci-fi action Double iSmart has collected Rs 18 crore and Rs 9 crore, respectively.
Elara Capital senior vice president Karan Taurani had predicted a significant box office boost on Independence Day, providing relief for exhibitors amid muted occupancy levels so far in the July-September quarter.
He expects Stree 2 to outperform and report a net lifetime box office collection of Rs 150 crore based on its strong opening.
""Momentum is likely to pick up in Q3 (October-December) FY25, led by several large franchise films across genres; the positive impact of Hollywood films is coming back post the Writer’s Association strike may continue into H1 CY25, which augurs well for driving higher average ticket price and spend per head,"" he added.
According to media consulting firm Ormax, gross domestic box office receipts were Rs 5,015 crore in the first half of the calendar year, which was 3% higher than the same period last year.
Kalki 2898 AD was the highest grossing film in the first half of 2024. With Rs 772 crore, it contributed 15% to the gross box office collections.
Jio Studios, Reliance Industries' media and content arm, produced 11 theatrical films, 35 digital releases, and 8 original web series in FY24, making it the largest film studio in the year.
The slate was released on various theatres, OTT, and broadcast platforms like Jio Cinema, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, Colors, and Star Network.
Jio Studios' films have earned Rs 700 crore at the box office, with every second film in Q4 FY2024 being a Jio Studios film.

Is there a new section of audience which values 'logic' more than 'emotional depth' in today's films?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/is-there-a-new-section-of-audience-which-values-logic-more-than-emotional-depth-in-todays-films/articleshow/112514281.cms,14-08-2024,"In the past few years, a common thread has emerged in the
films
which have been either highly successful at the
box office
or critically acclaimed. These films either lack emotional depth or have low emotional depth. Audiences which appreciate emotional depth and represent the idea of willing suspension of disbelief are unable to emotionally connect with these films. Their situation can be summed up by re-phrasing a journal entry of writer and critic
Susan Sontag
in her book
Reborn: Journals and Notebooks 1947-1963.
In the journal,
Susan Sontag
writes: ""Emotionally I wanted to stay. Intellectually I wanted to leave...As always, I seemed to enjoy punishing myself."" The audience, which values emotional depth in films, wants to stay intellectually but leave emotionally (from theatres) and they do not enjoy punishing themselves this way.
There are three questions which linger in their minds. Firstly: Is there a new section of audience which values 'logic' more than 'emotional depth' in today's films? Secondly: What has led to the emergence of this new section of audience? And, Thirdly: Why are
film-makers
making such films which appeal to such a specific section of audience and not a large section of audience?
De-humanising logic
The English poet and aesthetic philosopher
Samuel Taylor Coleridge
coined the expression ‘Willing Suspension of Disbelief’ in his biography Biographia Literaria. The basic idea behind this expression is audience accepts the fictional world created by an author and like an innocent child transports itself in that world. This idea works in films also. Films which achieve right balance of logic and emotional depth appeal to willing suspension of disbelief audience.
Before we understand and verify the emergence of this new section of audience, it is important to understand whether films which have been either successful at the box office or acclaimed critically lack emotional depth or have low emotional depth. Only then, it will support the argument of the emergence of a new section of audience.
Live Events
Among the releases in recent years,
Animal
(2023) is a key example of a film which lacks emotional depth and in which logic reigns supreme. The very name ""Animal"" is being used as a convincing basis for the film’s protagonist’s actions.
There are two parallel love stories in the film. There is a journey of a romantic love story between the son and his wife which runs parallel to the filial love story between the father and the son.
An important interaction which serves as the foundation of the union of the son and his future wife is clever logic. The son explains to her the idea of alpha male. He convinces her that men who belong to arts or similar fields which require the supreme gift of emotional intelligence are not
real
men. And this logic is enough for her to fall for him. There are no emotional moments which establish a deep connection between them. He does not even prove his worth or capability to her. Juxtapose this with the film
Maine Pyaar Kiya
(1989). In this, the hero (Salman Khan), also, belongs to a rich family. He proves his worth and capability by showing the heroine (Bhagyashree) and her father (Alok Nath) that he can earn and shoulder her responsibility. And in this journey, there are several moments which establish deep emotional connection with the audience and enhance the film’s emotional depth. This important factor made
Maine Pyaar Kiya (1989)
an able precursor to
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995)
.
Even the father-son filial love story in
Animal (2023)
is problematic as it lacks relatable emotional moments. A paramount question which comes to a viewer’s mind is: What is that one thing which has created such a deep-seated conflict in the son’s mind against his father? Even later in the film the son merely enacts a scene which shows how the father has treated him. This again is a mere enactment which has very little emotional value to it. One wonders: Why did not the makers show the scene the way it is supposed to have happened in the beginning of the film itself?
Raveena Sachdev, assistant professor of English Literature at a college in Mumbai, shares, ""I did not feel the hero's pain at all. I think his actions were directed more towards seeking validation than protecting his pack out of love. Where is the bond between the father and the son? Also, where is the strong reason for such a deep-seated conflict between them?"" She says, ""The son chooses to put everything and everyone at stake for his father. It doesn’t make sense. And believing that it is selfless would be too good to be true."" This lack of a clear conflict between the father and the son is a missing link which could have lent emotional depth to the film. This is a key reason why
Animal
(2023) pales in comparison with Hindi films which explore father-son conflict.
In Hindi cinema, one of the prominent films which centres on father-son relationship is legendary director Ramesh Sippy’s
Shakti
(1982). Right in the film's beginning the seeds of resentment are sown in the son's mind when his father who is an honest cop tells abductors that he is willing to sacrifice his son's life but not release the henchman of the gangster J K Verma. This scene not only provides a strong foundation for a sustained conflict between the father and the son but also necessary emotional depth in the film.
Another film which emerged highly successful at the box office and lacked the necessary emotional depth is
Oppenheimer
(2023). The film showed that a story told in detail does not necessarily have depth. A key aspect which is not adequately explored in the film is the nagging ‘guilt’ of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Swapnil Rawal, a communications manager with a leading firm, shares, “The story of
Oppenheimer
is largely about how the atomic bomb was used as a weapon of aggression. This created a life-long guilt in him because he was part of the team which created the atomic bomb. But there is hardly any emotional moment which explores his guilt and vulnerability."" He adds, ""The film unfolds like an audio-visual representation of the Wikipedia page of J. Robert Oppenheimer with all events transpiring swiftly. But this approach leads to just skimming through several emotional aspects of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life.”
In a similar context, this very aspect of exploring certain emotional and intimate details of a scientist’s life is achieved well in the film
A Beautiful Mind
(2001). Based on the life of scientist and mathematician
John Nash,
thefilm not only touches upon the peaks of his intellectual quests and achievements but also presents him in his most intimate and vulnerable moments. A case in the point is the scene in the film in which
Nash
realises that the kids are not growing up and that it is his own fatal imagination which troubles him and affects his relationships with his near and dear ones.
To a great degree, a film acquires emotional depth when it presents a story holistically. Increasingly, too much messaging in films has resulted in one-sided or one-dimensional presentation of its characters and relegated the role of emotional depth in films. Consequently, logic is stretched to such an extent that filmmakers have failed to realise that dialogues can not compensate for effective emotional moments and performances. A suitable example of these ideas is the film
Anatomy of a Fall
(2023).
Generally, a well-made relationship film contains a right balance of all moments. A prominent example of this is director Sam Mendes’s film
Revolutionary Road
(2008). There are highly emotional and happy moments in the way both spouses share each other’s dreams. And their respective failures in the pursuit of those dreams give a distinct emotional edge to the film. Unfortunately, this does not happen in
Anatomy of a Fall
(2023). There is no right balance of happy and unpleasant moments between the couple in the film. The film focusses intensely only on unpleasant moments between the couple and the consequent acrimony in their relationship. This one-dimensional storytelling obstructs the blossoming of the film into a highly emotional drama. Besides this, the film does not even emerge as an effective courtroom drama as arguments presented in the case amount to nothing but nitpicking.
Ameya Naik, founder-Fantasy Films, an event management company, shares, “
Anatomy of a Fall
is such a dull storytelling. There are no proofs that the wife has killed the husband. Even the bases of arguments of the case are trivial. After a long session of cross examination, she is proved innocent. A viewer is left wanting. There are no unexpected twists, cliffhanger or even a revelation.” He points out, “Even the portrayal of the visually impaired kid is incredible. How believable it is for a kid to rationalise complex things and feed aspirin to a dog to check whether the dog ate his father’s vomit? Also, it is a bit far-fetched how the kid’s testimony plays such a critical role in the wife’s acquittal.”

Logic becomes a problematic tool when it is used to understand emotional aspects of a film. In this way, audiences do not connect with the emotional aspects of a film’s story. The Hindi film
Merry Christmas
(2023) is one such film. In the film, the makers have not invested enough in building organically the chemistry between the two characters. It is easy and convenient to indulge in a meaning-making exercise and assume that if a man (Vijay Sethupati) and a woman (Katrina Kaif) are together then there is romantic love between them. But a delicate emotion like love must emerge from soft, tender and emotional moments and not from a scientific logic. A viewer must feel chemistry between two people. There is not a single emotional moment in
Merry Christmas
which establishes chemistry between these characters of different backgrounds through exchange of experiences and memories. This is a big lacuna in the film. Tejas Nirbhavane, a clinical psychologist, explains, “Did
Merry Christmas
show the journey of formation of a deep bond between the man and the woman to justify the man’s decision to take the blame of her husband’s murder? I found it very superficial. The film looks like a murder mystery. But it unfolds like a simple story of three lines. Two people from different backgrounds meet. There is a murder. And the man takes the blame. The film’s script is a letdown.”
Another film which has been appreciated well by the new section of audience and critics alike but did not resonate emotionally well with a certain section of audience is
Amar Singh
Chamkila
(2024). The film does not establish the sensitivity and vulnerability of Chamkila in the most unambiguous and touching manner. Chamkila is attacked and criticised by almost all sections of society for vulgarity in his songs. But there is not a scene in the film which shows him reflecting on his creations. Also, there is not a scene in the film which shows that he is experiencing inner turmoil or dilemma regarding his works. For a sensitive viewer, two important questions regarding the film’s story remain unaddressed. One is: Is he fighting a cause or a goal like most great artists? And the other is: Is he using ‘vulgarity’ as a weapon to expose the hypocrisy in the society? The film does not provide clear answers to these questions. There is no organic build-up in the film to show that Chamkila takes stock of his growth as an artist. In fact, Chamkila convinces his second wife that they must make the most of the time and not get discouraged by constant criticism and insults of the people around them. This shows that the motivation behind creating those songs in the film is driven more by commercial considerations rather than providing an outlet to his pent-up experiences of growing up in a hypocritical and utterly moralistic society through ‘seething’ expressions. One gets an impression that the makers made a weak attempt at trying to fit in the story of
Amar Singh Chamkila
in the 27 Club. Jaidev Hemmady, a scriptwriter, shares, ""In the film, Chamkila is doing shows for money. He tells his wife that they should continue working till the going is smooth. This is an attitude of a mercenary and not an artist. He is neither shown in an unambiguous manner fighting the cause of censorship or hypocrisy in the society nor is it established clearly that he believes in his art and is willing to die for it. It is difficult to root for such a character. In the film, he looked more like a businessman rather than a singer or an artist.”
The multi-lingual blockbuster
Kalki 2898 AD
is the most recent example of a film in which logic overpowers the storytelling so much that it erodes its entertaining value. The film like most recent films raises an important question: Can a film which merely engages be entertaining also? A distinguishing factor which makes a film entertaining is the audience’s emotional connection with its story and characters. But
Kalki 2898 AD
unfolds like a ‘video game’ where ‘actions’ and ‘thrills’ have more prominent roles than ‘emotions’. It is so intensely focussed on action sequences that one gets an impression that ‘dialogues’ are just a vehicle for another action sequence rather than furthering the film’s story.
The film is an emotional story of a totalitarian king who seeks immortality through the serum of foetus of fertile women. He desires the powerful serum contained in the foetus of the mother of
Kalki
. The Mahabharata’s character
Ashwatthama
protects
Kalki’s
mother because in saving her from the totalitarian king he will find redemption for killing the unborn child of the Mahabharata’s character
Uttara
. This shows that there is immense scope for emotional moments in the film. But the film utterly fails in creating emotional scenes which would have done justice to the premise of a great fantastical story based on Indian mythology. Yogesh Parkar, a banking professional, explains, “Neitherthescenes in which fertile women are tortured for serum nor the helplessness of
Ashwatthama’s
character in being cursed to live for eternity to see the evil acts of Kalyug people is explored in a moving or emotionally engaging way. Almost every scene is mechanically enacted just to arrive at high-octane action scenes.""
In a similar universe, almost a decade ago, a large audience across India had accepted the multi-lingual film
Baahubali: The Beginning
(2015).
Baahubali: The Beginning
(2015) succeeded in creating a captivating and fairytale kind of a universe based on highly dramatic and emotional elements of Indian epics. It was made in the Indian mould. The weapons, the battle fights, the look of army of soldiers and the whole universe of a fictional world contained in
Baahubali: The Beginning
were so familiar and appealing that theyresonatedwith the pan-India audience.
Kalki 2898 AD,
on the other hand, seems to be an attempt to fit in a story inspired by elements of Indian mythology in the templates of highly successful dystopian action or superhero films of the west.
The missing links in the films discussed above and their success at the box office to a certain extent show that a new section of audience has emerged which is comfortable with ‘understanding’ a film logically as opposed to ‘feeling’ or ‘connecting’ with it.
The change
There are a variety of factors behind the emergence of this new section of audience. Among these, three prominent factors provide a convincing basis. They are: generational shift, the all-pervaded impact of the pandemic and a societal shift.
In the past decade or more, this new section of audience frequents theatres more than the willing suspension of disbelief audience. The willing suspension of disbelief audience is more discerning and selective than the new section of audience in watching films in theatres. Media scholars point out that constant engagement on phones is a hurdle for the new section of audience in appreciating emotional depth in films. There are not many in this section of audience who are motivated to be in theatres to ‘just’ watch a film.
In this context, Dr Sanjay Ranade, Associate Professor at the Department of Communication and Journalism, University of Mumbai explains, “This new section of audience does not leave the world outside even when they enter a theatre. Where is the dark room today? This audience is almost constantly interacting on mobiles phones in theatres. Even in intermissions of films they are constantly communicating with the world. So, where is the time to appreciate depth in films? They are not even jarred when continuity in films is broken. They seemed to figure out things. If you think continuity in films is broken, then you are an old audience.” Given these tendencies, one is reminded of a line of a Hindi poet, which captures the irony of this situation. It goes:
Mujhe Gehraai Chahiye Lekin Sataah Par Chahiye
(I want depth but on the surface).
This trait is a mark of a generation for whom the social media platforms are a big reference point for most things in their lives. Media scholars share that this section of audience is more interested in performing the act of watching a film instead of watching a film out of keen curiosity or intense desire. These scholars observe that this audience watches films to elicit reactions, seek validation and earn approval of their peers. Dr. Faiz Ullah, an assistant professor at the School of Media and Cultural Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, explains, “Today, we are more focused on aesthetics. We see good photos of cafes on social media platforms. These photos do not inform a user whether one cafe is serving better food than the other cafe. It is just about posting photos. These photos drive people to those cafes. This is happening with films also. But one needs to understand that aesthetics cannot compensate for feeling or experience.""
Ranade of University of Mumbai shares similar thoughts. He shares, “The young generation wants to be ‘seen’ watching a film. They write reviews and if people like it then the film is good. This is the answer for crowd in theatres."" He adds, ""If a person from this new section of audience is told that she will get a cake and will be appreciated if she reads a book, then getting the cake and appreciation becomes more important than reading the book. So, watching a film is just a means to seek approval, appreciation or attention of people. Due to this, the idea of emotional engagement becomes unimportant.”
There are psychological reasons also behind the emergence of this new section of audience. Psychologists point out the impact of the pandemic triggered by the widespread of the Corona virus on the way audiences respond to highly emotional content. They point out that the new section of audience is not looking for cathartic experiences—a hallmark of the willing suspension of disbelief audience—through films. This new section of audience is looking for an emotional bypass. Deepti Khandelwal, a counselling psychologist, points out, ""People have not processed the pandemic, yet. They do not have the emotional bandwidth for highly emotional films as these films may open a Pandora’s box or force them to confront certain skeleton in their closet. Today, increasingly, people are not looking for substance in films. They want an emotional bypass. They want to land at something without actually feeling it.""
Priyanka Shah Dattani, another counselling psychologist, points out that social media platforms have been instrumental in providing cathartic experiences to this new section of audience. She says, ""Today, the new section of audience does not need cathartic experience through films. They are expressing themselves well on social media platforms and these platforms provide them cathartic experiences.”
The wide acceptance of technology, social media platforms and other applications of communications has also contributed to the emergence of this new section of audience which values logic more than emotional depth in films. Today, there is a surge of a ‘sense of competence’ among people thanks to their access to a vast reservoir of knowledge and information on the internet. They have gained a certain capacity to analyse things. They are familiar with the essential stylistic grammar of Hindi films to a reasonable extent. In the backdrop of these facts, today, people do not watch films like an audience. This new section of audience thinks and watches films like directors or creators.
Often, this audience intersperses conversations about films with statements such as: the film was shot well or the film was edited well. This sense of competence comes from the fact that they have tools and power to create content. And they are using those tools to create their own stuff. A prime example of this is reels on Instagram. So, while watching films, it seems, one creator is judging another creator. The humility with which the old audience submitted wholeheartedly and without prejudice to a film’s story is nearly absent today. As a result of this, ‘understanding’ a film has become paramount than ‘experiencing’ or ‘feeling’ a film. Therefore, this new section of audience is fine with ‘logic’ rather than ‘emotional depth’ in films.
To a great extent, even as technology is inventing new ways of communication, the emotional bond or connection between people has not materially improved. We live in a society where we are connected digitally but not emotionally and intimately. These elements are reflected in our films also. It seems that the potential pleasures which technology may provide us are more tempting, certain and easier-to-deal-with than the demands and expectations entailed in a human company. Today, a key question which sensitive souls engage in is: Who pines for whom? There are many things with which people fill their lives. There is so much content to watch on streaming platforms and YouTube. Then, there are social media platforms. In such a backdrop, the intensity of emotional connection among people is not that high. Due to this, the tendency to ‘feel’ and ‘experience’ things is not observed in a pronounced manner. Scriptwriter Jaidev Hemmady shares, “I think modernisation is actually preventing people from connecting with each other. There is a restaurant which runs a chain of pubs in Mumbai. I have stopped going there. You can only order food and drinks through an app. You can't even ask a waiter to get you a drink. This is what technology has done to us.”
Unfortunately, the creative environment in the Hindi film industry has also become unemotional in a similar manner. Today, almost every key interaction between creative people happens on e-mails, zoom calls and other applications. Unlike this, earlier, artists would meet in person to narrate stories, discuss, and have long musical sessions. Corporate or studio culture has almost dominated the industry. In this culture, there is no childlike enthusiasm to make something wonderful among film-makers. There is a pie chart for everything. Most actors don't take narrations. They ask a writer to mail a script which is read by their managers. In essence, this culture does not value ‘emotions’ at all. This makes the almost the entire process of filmmaking unemotional.
Scholars also opine that the diminishing role of songs in today’s Hindi films has considerably reduced the possibility of emotional connection with films. There are umpteen films which have struck a deep emotional chord with audience merely on the strength of their songs.
Aashiqui
(1990) is one such film. Dr. Faiz Ullah of Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai observes, “I think the element of Marma or emotional core is missing in our society to a certain extent. Our films were never about understanding a story. They are about 'feeling' a story. This is the rasa in the Indian arts. Our great film-makers understood this. So, they introduced songs and music and took a viewer back and forth in films. In this way, they created emotional depth in films. But today, songs have almost lost relevance in storytelling.”
Illusion and Magic
Even though the new section of audience has shown a clear preference for films which lack or have low emotional depth, they are not completely unresponsive or averse to films which have right balance of emotional depth and logic. In fact, this audience has also appreciated such films. A prominent example is the Hindi film
12
th
Fail
(2023). The film brought not only the willing suspension of disbelief audience to theatres, but it also appealed to this new section of audience. It is reflected in the film’s stupendous success. The film made a business of more than Rs70 crore on a modest budget of less than Rs20 crore. Also,
Gadar 2: The Katha Continues
(2023), which had exceptional success at the box office worked purely on the strength of its emotional connection and conviction. The film followed the aesthetics of the 1990s which values the importance of stirring emotions in audience rather than just impressing them with ingenuity of structure and aesthetics. It generated an all-pervaded frenzy, which was seen after a long time for a Hindi film. The film collected Rs 625.5 crore at the box office in India alone on a budget of Rs60 crore.
So, the key hurdle is filmmakers are not making ‘enough’ films which have right balance of emotional depth and logic. At present, the number of films, which give more prominence to logic than emotional depth does not outnumber films which have right balance of emotional depth and logic. So, the responsibility lies with filmmakers to make ‘more’ films which have right balance of logic and emotional depth since these films appeal to a wider audience and not a section of audience.
In the coming years, film-makers will have to focus on three key elements which distinguish ‘cinema’ from the plethora of audio-visual content available in the form of Instagram reels, TikTok videos, documentaries and other videos on social media platforms. These three key elements are: aesthetics, logic and emotional depth. Superior aesthetics, emotional depth and logic in films will be the three key weapons which will help filmmakers win over the onslaught of audio-visual content around them and bring a wide audience to theatres. And these three key strengths can only be achieved in films through conviction and sincerity of vision.
Laapata Ladies
(2024) is an example of such a film, which has cut across audiences and appealed emotionally to a larger base of audience.
In fact,
12
th
Fail
(2023) and
Laapata Ladies
(2024) are more likely to be remembered as ‘fine’ films in the next one decade. They will not be remembered just for their box office collections. These films represent the two basic principles of cinema mentioned by legendary American actor John Wayne in an interview to
Playboy
magazine. These principles are: Illusion and Magic. The logic and aesthetics in these films create a certain credible ‘illusion’ of a believable world and the emotional depth in them provides a spell of ‘magic’ which lingers in a viewer’s mind even after watching these films. In fact, there is no cinema without its illusion and magic. In the coming years, only these two elements will save cinema from becoming too niche as actress Natalie Portman stated in an interview with
Vanity Fair
magazine. After all, ‘magic’ and ‘illusion’ make cinema an endearing gift which helps forget everything that is superfluous in us and makes us realise that circumstances or challenges in our lives are not completely ‘unique’ or ‘exceptional’.

Multiplexes expect a blockbuster weekend,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/multiplexes-expect-a-blockbuster-weekend/articleshow/112511712.cms,14-08-2024,"Film exhibitors expect record footfalls through the five-day weekend that coincides with the screening of potentially blockbuster Hindi and regional films, such as Stree 2, Khel Khel Mein, Vedaa, Double iSmart, and Thangalaan.
Executives at
PVR Inox
and
Cinepolis
say that the footfalls during the five-day long weekend that begins with Independence Day on Thursday have the potential to break the previous year's record of 35 million footfalls during the I-Day week.
""For us, it's better when 4 to 5 films work well in tandem rather than one film going through the roof. Stree 2 and Khel Khel Mein are seeing strong traction, but Vedaa, Double iSmart, and Thangalaan are also looking very promising,"" said
PVR Inox
co-CEO Gautam Dutta.
PVR Inox has done advance bookings of 4.5 lakh tickets between the five movies and expects ticket sales to accelerate as the week progresses.
""This is just the tip of the iceberg, as we have just opened Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday bookings. This number should be looked at from the perspective that the trend of advance bookings is not very high,"" Dutta added.

"Hotstar, JioCinema beat parents' TV operations in valuations game",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/hotstar-jiocinema-beat-parents-tv-operations-in-valuations-game/articleshow/112269797.cms,04-08-2024,"Disney+ Hotstar and
JioCinema
's valuations have surpassed their parent companies' linear TV businesses, with
EY
and
BDO
having valued
Viacom18
at ₹33,000 crore and
Star India
at ₹26,000 crore, as per documents seen by ET.
EY was engaged by Viacom18, a Reliance Industries (
RIL
)-backed company, to do the valuation process prior to the signing of the merger deal, while BDO was hired by Star India, owned by
Walt Disney
.
On February 28, RIL and Disney signed a deal to merge Star India and Viacom18, creating an entity valued at ₹70,352 crore, including a ₹11,500 crore fund infusion by RIL.
Both firms conducted the valuation exercise using the comparable companies multiples (CCM) method, which determines value based on multiples generated from valuations of comparable companies.
According to BDO's valuation, Star's entertainment business was valued at a revenue multiple of 1.75 times (₹15,999 crore), while the digital business (Disney+ Hotstar) was valued at a revenue multiple of 3.81 times (₹16,040 crore). BDO assessed Star India's valuation by examining its trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue until December 31, 2023, which included ₹9,142.2 crore from linear entertainment and ₹4,210.6 crore from digital revenue.

Based on the revenue multiples, BDO arrived at an enterprise value of ₹31,992.9 crore for Star India. After adjusting for liabilities related to the sports business, the equity value was reduced to ₹25,900.2 crore, or ₹524.5 per share.
""This transaction reaffirms that digital businesses command valuations twice as high as traditional businesses, thanks to their flexibility and broader scope in distribution and revenue generation,"" said
media expert Rajesh Sethi
.
He said the valuation of sports content is also poised for reassessment as the industry transitions from a three-player landscape to a two-player competition. Media Partners Asia has forecast that the video entertainment industry will reach a value of $13 billion by 2028, with over the top (OTT) platforms contributing half of the new revenue growth.
In the case of Viacom18, the valuation firm provided a consolidated revenue multiple for both linear TV and streaming businesses.
BDO estimated an enterprise value of ₹15,622 crore for Viacom18, based on a revenue multiple of 2.6 times and revenue of ₹6,012.5 crore for the TTM ending December 2023.
Viacom18's equity value surged to ₹32,937 crore after adjusting for cash balance, investments, intangible assets under development and surplus assets. In April 2023, Reliance and Bodhi Tree Systems invested ₹15,145 crore in Viacom 18.
Under the scheme of arrangement submitted by Viacom18 and Star India to the National Company Law Tribunal, Viacom18 will transfer JioCinema to its subsidiary Digital18 on a slump sale basis for a consideration of ₹24,186 crore.
For the transfer of Viacom18's other media operations to Digital18, the consideration will be ₹2,769 crore. Digital18 will subsequently transfer these assets to Star India.
EY arrived at a valuation of ₹32,955 crore for Viacom18 and ₹25,926 crore for Star India. Star India's valuation was conducted on a debt-free basis as it is unlikely to have any cash.
Based on its valuation report and RIL's ₹11,500 crore fund infusion, EY suggested Star India's shareholding to be 46.8% (Viacom 18), 36.8% (Star India) and 16.3% (
RIL
).
As per the merger agreement, RIL will have an effective 56% controlling interest in the Star-Viacom18 combined entity, followed by Walt Disney with a 37% stake. Bodhi Tree Systems, a company promoted by James Murdoch and Uday Shankar, will own a 7% stake in the proposed merged entity.

"Viacom18, Star India expect to complete merger by October",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/viacom18-star-india-expect-to-complete-merger-by-october/articleshow/112209665.cms,02-08-2024,"Reliance Industries-promoted
Viacom18
and Walt Disney-owned
Star India
are hopeful of completing their merger by October, when the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is also expected to issue its order, officials familiar with the matter told ET.
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has already put the merger scheme between Star and Viacom18 for final disposal. The merger, which was announced on February 28, is expected to receive the
NCLT
green signal as creditors and shareholders of both companies have approved it.
""The biggest barrier to the merger proposal is the CCI approval. Once the competition watchdog approval comes, the merger deal will be more or less concluded. The expectation internally is that the CCI approval might come in October,"" said one of the officials tracking the development.
As part of its probe into the likely impact of the merger on the competitive landscape, CCI has started reaching out to other broadcasters, streaming platforms, TV distributors, and advertisers.
""CCI has reached out to us a couple of weeks back to know our views about the Star-Viacom18 merger,"" said a top executive with a rival media firm, on condition of anonymity.
Live Events
The executive stated that this is a standard approach adopted by the CCI in all merger transactions, enabling the competition watchdog to assess a merger's impact in an industry.
""Even in the Sony-Zee merger case, CCI reached out to all the key players in the industry,"" the executive said, adding that the commission typically issues an order a few months after its industry outreach.
Both Star and Viacom18 have already made their submissions to the CCI, arguing that the merger will not have an appreciable adverse impact on the M&E industry in the country since there is enough competition in the market, said a third media executive who didn't want to be named.
Media analysts predict that Sony, Zee, Sun, Netflix, Prime Video, and YouTube will provide sufficient competition to Star-Viacom18 in both linear TV and streaming segments.
""While they (Star-Viacom18) will have a lot of synergistic benefits together, which we also talked about when we were trying to do our merger (Sony-Zee), it does not restrict or make us less capable of competing with them,"" Zee Entertainment CEO Punit Goenka said during the company's Q1 earnings call when asked about the impact of the Star-Viacom18 merger on Zee.
ET had reported in March that the CCI will conduct a more thorough investigation into the merger between Star and Viacom18 because it has the potential to disrupt the M&E business. In May, Star and Viacom18 filed a combination notice with the CCI seeking approval for their merger deal.
With over 100 TV channels across entertainment and sports and two of the top streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema, Star-Viacom18 will have a commanding presence in both segments, with the nearest competitor being a distant second in both segments.
The combined operating revenue of Star and Viacom18 was roughly Rs 25,000 crore in FY23, with the combined revenue of the nearest competitors in TV (Zee) and streaming (Netflix) being Rs 11,000 crore.
The combination will make Star-Viacom18 the biggest player in sports with properties like Indian Premier League, India international bilateral cricket, International Cricket Council, Indian Super League, and Pro Kabaddi League.
However, Star and Viacom18 argue that these properties were acquired through transparent open market bidding, where competing players also bid aggressively. The argument was made that the accumulation of sports rights, which are awarded for a limited time, cannot significantly impact competition.
In its order in the now-defunct Sony-Zee merger scheme, CCI ordered Sony-Zee to sell three channels to mitigate potential adverse impact on the sector.
Legal experts believe that the CCI might order Star-Viacom18 to divest certain assets since this merger will lead to the creation of a much bigger entity than the Sony-Zee combine.

"Discussions on 8-week consistent theatrical window positive, says PVR Inox MD",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/discussions-on-8-week-consistent-theatrical-window-positive-says-pvr-inox-md/articleshow/112022388.cms,25-07-2024,"Cinema exhibitors
and
film producers
are discussing a consistent eight-week
theatrical window
in north and south India, as well as expanding it further to protect box office revenues, a top industry executive said. ""We have had some positive conversations with respect to increasing windows, making them consistent across the country,""
PVR Inox MD Ajay Bijli
told analysts during the company's Q1 earnings call.
The theatrical window in
north India
is eight weeks, while in south India it is typically four weeks. A theatrical window ensures that a movie doesn't release on streaming or satellite broadcasting until it is in theatres.
""We are still recovering from Covid, and a lot of producers are still grappling to put together profitability plans for the films. Therefore, it is difficult to put a timeline to this. But all I can say is that there is consensus that windows moving forward should be consistent across the country,"" he said.
Bijli also emphasised the urgent need to extend the theatrical window from eight weeks to a longer duration, stating that stakeholders have held multiple discussions on the issue.
Cinema exhibition chains have been calling for a longer theatrical window since footfalls are still below pre-Covid level. The drop in footfalls has been attributed to the decrease in the window between theatrical and OTT releases of films.

On the issue of the 2% cess levied by the Karnataka government on movie tickets, PVR Inox chief business planning & strategy Kamal Gianchandani, who is also the president of Multiplex Association of India (MAI), said that the cess will be detrimental for the industry.
He also said the MAI is in touch with state-level industry bodies on the issue. According to him, the cess will defeat the purpose of Goods and Services Tax (GST), which promised a single tax across India.
""We are aligned that this is something that is detrimental to the industry and sets a wrong example. We are confident that we would be able to meet the relevant ministry, the state government ministry, and the relevant government officers and say our point of view,"" he added.

Cinema exhibition chains have been calling for a longer theatrical window since footfalls are still below pre-Covid level. The drop in footfalls has been attributed to the decrease in the window between theatrical and
OTT releases
of films.
According to Ormax Media, footfalls have declined by 8.44% to 943 million in 2023 (post-pandemic) from 1.03 billion in 2019 (pre-pandemic).
Devyani
PVR Inox
Food Court, the 51:49 joint venture (JV) between
Devyani International
and
PVR
Inox, will launch food courts in shopping malls under the brand name Treat Junction.
""In the next two to three months, we expect at least two food courts to be fully operational. The locations have been identified. By the end of this fiscal, about four to five food courts will be operational,"" said PVR
Inox
head of investor relations and corporate finance Gaurav Sharma.
On the issue of the 2% cess levied by the Karnataka government on movie tickets, PVR Inox chief business planning & strategy Kamal Gianchandani, who is also the president of Multiplex Association of India (MAI), said there is no confirmation that this is a definitive government order.
He also said the MAI is in touch with state-level industry bodies on the issue. According to him, the cess will defeat the purpose of Goods and Services Tax (GST), which promised a single tax across India.
""We are aligned that this is something that is detrimental to the industry and sets a wrong example. We are confident that we would be able to meet the relevant ministry, the state government ministry, and the relevant government officers and say our point of view,"" he added.

Investment in
original online video shows
is expected to touch $1.2 billion by 2028, up from $479 million in 2023.
The report said that over-the-top (OTT) entertainment content spending is narrowing the gap with pay TV, which has historically led video content investments.
As per the report, streaming VOD has created about 174,000 direct and indirect jobs, with the potential to nearly double employment opportunities by 2028.
Streaming VOD’s impact now extends far beyond the creative industry into allied industries, including telecom, broadband, pay TV,
VFX
, animation, tourism, and hospitality, it said.
Video has been the primary driver of data consumption for telcos, accounting for over 70% of their data traffic.
The report also said that streaming has become a critical revenue stream for film producers, with revenue from the segment equating to 1.5 times their net share from the theatrical box office.
India’s top six streaming platforms—Disney+ Hotstar, Prime Video, Netflix, Sony LIV, Zee5, and Voot/Jio Cinema—collectively released about 1,000 original titles comprising nearly 4,000 hours of original content between 2015 and 2023.

Regional OTT platforms seek fresh funds to scale up content offerings,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/regional-ott-platforms-seek-fresh-funds-to-scale-up-content-offerings/articleshow/111936865.cms,22-07-2024,"Regional over-the-top (OTT) platforms, which cater to audiences in specific
languages
, are seeking capital to ramp up businesses as
growth
in their primary markets has plateaued, say industry experts.
Regional
OTT platforms
like Stage, Chaupal, and Aha are in the
market
to raise fresh capital. Planet Marathi recently raised $5 million from US private equity firm A & MA Capital.
Last year, Stage raised ₹40 crore in a
funding
round led by Blume Ventures. Subsequently, Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra invested an undisclosed sum in the platform, which has raised close to $15 million till date (as per Tracxn data).
Media expert Rajesh Sethi said
investors
are showing a keen interest in regional OTT platforms that have established themselves in specific language markets. ""However, many regional OTT platforms have plateaued and need to expand into other markets and languages to develop scale. The necessity to scale has prompted regional OTT platforms to scout for fresh funding,"" he added.

According to the FICCI-EY report on media and entertainment, regional OTT
content
volumes exceeded Hindi-language content for the first time in 2023.
Akshay Bardapurkar, founder of Planet Marathi OTT, said the recent funding will allow it to diversify its content slate besides investing in marketing and technology.
Chaupal, which has raised $4 million till date (as per Tracxn data), is eyeing a new funding round to fuel expansion into new languages and aid growth. It offers content in Punjabi, Haryanvi, and Bhojpuri languages.
The platform's co-founder Ujjwal Mahajan noted that regional languages have huge diasporic audiences around the world, which presents a huge opportunity to provide these audiences with quality content that is relatable.
""Investors realise that the next phase of growth will come from Bharat, and Bharat speaks in its Maa Boli. This defines the entire thesis for Maa Boli ka Chaupal. Moreover, content costs are way lower for regional languages as compared to mainstream languages,"" Mahajan said.
Vinay Singhal, CEO and Co-Founder, Stage, which offers Haryanvi and Rajasthani content, said the surge in investor interest in regional OTT platforms in India is due to the vast untapped opportunity in the regional space combined with growing internet and smartphone penetration and the ease of doing digital payments due to UPI.
""This is further fuelled by the rising demand for regional content that resonates with local audiences, as well as the proven success of existing regional OTT platforms,"" he added.
A case in point is Bengali OTT platform Hoichoi, which has launched in Bangladesh after cementing its position among Bengali audiences in India.

"Cinema houses, OTTs wary as Karnataka govt levies 2% cess",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/cinema-houses-otts-wary-as-karnataka-govt-levies-2-cess/articleshow/111936825.cms,24-07-2024,"The Karnataka government's decision to levy a
2% cess
on
movie tickets
and over-the-top (OTT) subscriptions will lead to an additional burden on cinema chains and OTT platforms, who will pass on the
price increase
to consumers.
Industry experts, though, say that the price increase will be marginal and the revenue generation for the state government will be miniscule. As per industry estimates, the state government can expect Rs 60 crore in incremental revenue from the levying of the 2% cess.
While the stated objective of the state government behind levying the cess is the welfare of film artists and cultural activists, experts note that effective implementation will be key to achieving this objective.
According to Elara Capital SVP Karan Taurani, Karnataka would be contributing an estimated 15% to the national box office collections of Rs 10–12,000 crore annually. In terms of
OTT subscriptions
, the state's estimated share of the Rs 10,000 crore subscription OTT market would be 10%.
""The 2% cess will lead to a positive impact of Rs 60 crore for the Karnataka government. It's a mild negative for both the box office and OTT subscription businesses,"" he stated.
Live Events
He noted that OTT platforms, which are already raking in heavy losses, will have a small negative impact on their plans to scale up. Similarly, cinema chains will be compelled to hike ticket prices even as footfalls are 20–30% lower compared to pre-covid levels.
Chandrasekar Mantha, Partner, Media and Entertainment Sector Leader, Deloitte India, said the proposed 2% cess on movie tickets and OTT platforms will likely be passed on to consumers.
""The movie industry in Karnataka currently pays an entertainment tax of 30%, and the additional cess may slightly increase ticket prices. Similarly, OTT platforms will need to comply with the 2% cess based on their subscription numbers for the state,"" he stated.
Mantha also said that the cess will be a beneficial initiative from the perspective of the welfare of creative and technical cine personnel; however, its effective implementation is crucial.
Taurani noted that there is no clarity on how the benefits of this initiative will be passed on to the artists.

OTTs bet big on international shows to add variety to original content,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/otts-bet-big-on-international-shows-to-add-variety-to-original-content/articleshow/111763253.cms,16-07-2024,"Mumbai: Over-the-top (OTT) platforms are increasingly betting on
international shows
to bolster their
original content
offerings at a time when
audience fragmentation
is posing a challenge due to the availability of multiple entertainment options.
Disney+ Hotstar has tasted success with multiple international titles, including British TV hits such as The Night Manager and Criminal Justice, Aarya, a show based on the Dutch show Penoza, which was nominated at the International Emmy Awards, and Bad Cop, a German show with the same name.
JioCinema
has launched reality shows such as Temptation Island and Bigg Boss OTT, a remake of Big Brother. Likewise,
SonyLIV
has adapted multiple international productions for the Indian market, including Israeli shows such as Your Honour and Fauda.
Experts said
OTT platforms
are investing in international content since it adds variety to their content line-up, and Indian consumers are also receptive due to their exposure to international content in recent years.
They said the demand for international content, particularly scripted shows, on OTT is growing since they keep the viewers hooked for a longer period while also expanding the content library.

Unlike TV broadcasters, who were big on licensing non-fiction content, streaming platforms are focusing heavily on fiction since digital allows them the freedom to experiment with newer formats.
""With a strong consumer insight mining engine at play, we have understood there is an appetite for successful international shows among our viewers here. It allows for diversity in content, offering fresh ideas and concepts and giving us an opportunity to bring something unique that maximises audience engagement,” said a Disney+ Hotstar spokesperson.
Mrinalini Jain, group chief development officer,
Banijay Asia
& Endemol Shine India, said there is an advantage in adapting shows that have already been successful globally since they have a well-established plot to follow.
“While these shows have a legacy and pedigree attached to them, making them a safer bet for investments, the challenge lies in hyper localising them as per the Indian market and innovating them for OTT platforms to make them a success, whether it be a scripted or unscripted format,"" she said.
Fremantle India managing director Aradhana Bhola said international shows are a big success in India since they come with proven track records and hence are safer bets.
“Also, the pandemic accelerated viewers’ exposure to world content. From Turkish, Korean, Israeli, and European content, Indians were exposed to a whole range of storytelling, and we lapped it up, becoming agnostic to language and geographical boundaries,” she said.
Sunder Aaron, co-founder of Locomotive Global, said OTT platforms are trying to programme content that has done well on TV, whether it is Bigg Boss or MasterChef. “All of them are trying to attract mass audiences, so it's natural for them to look at what has worked on TV,” he said.
Locomotive Global has produced 'Rana Naidu', the Hindi adaptation of the Showtime series 'Ray Donovan' for Netflix India.
Till now, Indian OTT platforms have imported shows from the Americas and the UK; however, there is a growing appetite for Korean, Spanish, and Turkish content as well, Jain said.
According to a FICCI-EY report, OTT platforms spent about Rs 6,000 crore on entertainment content in 2023. Almost 3,000 hours of original content was produced for streaming platforms.

from the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) on Friday, will undertake its future subscriber expansion through HITS, the executive added, requesting anonymity.
Currently,
NXT Digital
, owned by the
Hinduja Group
, is the sole provider of integrated services that include both HITS and cable TV services.
HITS is a satellite-based platform that combines the features of cable TV and DTH. HITS and cable TV deliver TV signals via satellite and optical fibre, respectively, to end consumers through local cable operators, while DTH signals are delivered directly to consumers through satellite.
""HITS will allow us to compete with DTH, including DD-Free Dish, besides growing our penetration in cable-dark areas. It will help us to expand in rural India, particularly in north India, besides reducing operating expenditure in urban pockets,"" the executive said.

GTPL Hathway currently spends Rs 85-90 crore on bandwidth-related expenses, which is expected to go up to Rs 100 crore in FY26. ""Expansion through HITS will enable us to reduce our bandwidth cost by 50%,"" the executive said.
The company, which currently offers cable TV and broadband services, plans to hire 12 Telkomsat C-band transponders for HITS services. It plans to establish a cutting-edge uplinking facility in Ahmedabad for HITS.
""Over the past two years, we have seen a net subscriber addition of 0.5 million annually, with the potential to increase to 0.75-1 million once the
HITS service
is operational,"" the executive said.
GTPL is willing to share its HITS infrastructure with other service providers, as it has been permitted by the MIB, the official said.
As of June, GTPL had 8.9 million paid cable TV customers, besides 1.03 million broadband subscribers. In Q1 FY25, the company's consolidated net profit fell 61% to Rs 14 crore, while income grew 9% to Rs 850 crore.

Tata
Play, India’s leading content distribution platform, had in September last year launched the
Tata Play Binge PaaS
for OTT aggregators across the globe, enabling Tata Play to provide end-to-end development and deployment opportunities. Back then, in an industry-first move, Tata Play had collaborated with Philippines’ leading Pay-Tv provider Cignal TV.
The company had told ET Online it was actively engaged in talks with many other players across the world who are keen to take Tata Play's tech solution to evolve into OTT aggregators.
While Tata Play had signed the deal with Cignal last year, the offering will be launched soon. Bangladesh has gone to market on 8th July, and Cignal will go to market in a month or so, Nagpal said.
""We are in conversations with many others as of now. There is almost couple of them in every continent in the world that we’re talking to. The discussions are various stages of closure, and we should be housing more partnerships in the coming months,"" Nagpal said.
Coming from the house of conglomerate
Tata group
, Tata Play Binge is an OTT aggregation service that brings content from more than 30 apps in one app.
Tata's global expansion of the PaaS solution comes at a strategic moment as the OTT market is rapidly attracting more users and this may potentially boost the company's revenue.
Moreover, if aggregation becomes widely adopted globally, and more users recognise the benefits of a unified subscription model on a single platform, Tata Play could then capitalise on this trend and expand its market presence.
Nagpal said the offering helps companies tying up with Tata Play on this solution to save 75% of their time and 75% of cost in creating it.
On being asked if Tata Play has any cost to recover, Nagpal said the company had built the platform for Indian market and and is already earning revenues. Offering the services to foreign markets now does not come at any additional cost and Tata Play is thus able to deliver to clients at a reasonable rate, he added.

Is Cartoon Network shutting down? Channel issues clarification,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/fact-check-is-cartoon-network-shutting-down-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/111597256.cms,10-07-2024,"#RIPCartoonNetwork
has been trending on X (formerly known as
Twitter
) amid reports that the channel is shutting down. The trend started when a X account ""
Animation Workers Ignited
"" shared an
animation
claiming that ""
Cartoon Network
is essentially dead."" The post also suggested that other animation studios are facing similar challenges, particularly due to
layoffs
in the industry.
— AWorkersIgnited (@AWorkersIgnited)
Origins of the #RIPCartoonNetwork trend
The animation stated, ""Cartoon Network is essentially dead and other big animation studios are not far behind. What happened to all the animation workers? Many are unemployed in record numbers, with some jobless for over a year, despite carrying the industry during the pandemic. When Covid first hit, animation was able to operate completely remotely, making it one of the only forms of entertainment that could continue production uninterrupted. But studios repaid them by cancelling projects, outsourcing jobs, and laying off artists en masse.""
Channel issues clarification
Cartoon Network issued a statement clarifying that
rumours
of the network or its studio shutting down are untrue. ""Cartoon Network would like to clarify that there is no truth to the speculation that the network or the studio is shutting down. With a number of recently announced greenlights, we remain committed to continually investing in innovative content that entertains and inspires our viewers across the globe,"" the company stated.

The video attributed these issues to greed, claiming that big studios improved their financials by reducing spending and cutting staff, allowing CEOs and executives to reap the benefits. It urged viewers to spread the word by posting about their favourite Cartoon Network shows with the hashtag #RIPCartoonNetwork and to follow the account for more ways to support the cause.
Public reactions
The clip quickly went viral, garnering over three million views in less than four hours. Social media users initially shared their favourite cartoons using the hashtag #RIPCartoonNetwork. One user commented, ""Courage The Cowardly Dog will always be a favourite! It’s very sad to hear that the animators were treated so poorly, and hopefully, they can find work soon!""
— GabbyShires (@GabbyShires)
Another reminisced, ""I’ll probably remember that episode of 'The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy' when they tried to get her to smile for the rest of my life.""
— ShadyMikeGaming (@ShadyMikeGaming)
Clarifying the rumors
As the hashtag gained traction, rumours began to circulate that Cartoon Network was shutting down permanently. However, these claims are false. The account ""Animation Workers Ignited,"" associated with the animators' union, is using the hashtag #RIPCartoonNetwork to highlight the challenges faced by industry workers. The channel itself is not shutting down.

DTH companies lose over 3 million users in FY24,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/dth-companies-lose-over-3-million-users-in-fy24/articleshow/111560079.cms,08-07-2024,"The four private direct-to-home (
DTH
) operators lost 3.28 million active subscribers in the fiscal year ending March 2024, despite the presence of the Indian Premier League (
IPL
) and the
ICC Men's Cricket World Cup
2023 held in India.
The subscriber base declined due to free streaming of the two events by
JioCinema
(IPL) and Disney+ Hotstar (ICC CWC) and price hikes by
broadcasters
that forced
DTH operators
to pass on the burden of higher prices to consumers.
DTH platforms have traditionally utilised big sporting events to acquire and activate customers. However, the free cricket streaming has impacted their ability to use live cricket to attract new subscribers.
The Indian DTH industry, comprising four private and one government-owned operator, is seeing a decline in subscribers due to stiff competition from Prasar Bharati-owned DD Free Dish and over-the-top (OTT) platforms like Netflix and Prime Video.

become near total - and predictable? Going by the numbers, that seems to be the script. The share of box office collections of regional films in India's total box office collection in the past one year has jumped to 56.8% in the June 2024 quarter from 40.3% in the June 2023 quarter.
According to domestic brokerage B&K, the total box office collection-Hindi, regional and Hollywood-increased to ₹1,798 crore in the June 2024 quarter from ₹1,796 crore in the June 2023 quarter. In the same period, the share of
Hindi films
in India's total box office collections has dropped to 35.1% from 41.3%.
Ameya Naik, head,
Fantasy Films
, an event management company said, ""Today,
Hindi
film-makers focus only on business. There is no passion in telling a story. It seems that they have forgotten the art of stirring emotions in
audiences
. With a few exceptions of 12th Fail and Laapataa Ladies, I don't remember a Hindi film in the past year which stirred me emotionally."" He added, ""Hindi film stars not only interfere with the vision of films but they make them economically unviable by charging obscenely high fees.""
ET Bureau
Komal Nahta
, veteran trade analyst, pointed out, ""A reason for sub-standard Hindi films could be the easy availability of
money
in the form of revenue from sale of
streaming platforms
and other rights in recent years. In most cases, well-known Hindi film banners recover 40-50% of their costs through the sales of these rights."" He added, ""Regional
film-makers
are sincere and earnest in their vision. The vision of directors and writers down the south is sacrosanct and is followed by all. This is the reason why regional films are faring better than Hindi.""

Naik of Fantasy Films said, ""Today, audiences are interested only in engaging films irrespective of their language, budget or even whether they are headlined by stars. A prominent example is the noteworthy success of a small-budget Hindi film Munjya. I don't believe in this myth that audiences do not want to come out of their homes for entertainment. If they were glued to their personal screens, then how do you explain the massive crowd which greeted the victory parade of the Indian cricket team in South Mumbai? Audiences just want a compelling reason to watch a film, which Hindi film-makers are not providing.""

Spotify India narrows net loss in FY23,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/spotify-india-narrows-net-loss-in-fy23/articleshow/111522172.cms,06-07-2024,"Audio streaming giant Spotify's India unit narrowed its net loss by 26% to Rs 344 crore in the
financial year
ended March 2023, according to the company's financial data sourced from business intelligence platform Tofler.
Spotify India
LLP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sweden’s Spotify AB, grew its
revenue
by 86% to Rs 167 crore. Expenditure fell 9% to Rs 504 crore.
The platform's
subscription
revenue jumped 66% to Rs 88 crore, while
ad revenue
surged 91% to Rs 63 crore.
Spotify entered the Indian market in 2019. The company is yet to file its FY24 financials.
Globally, India is one of the fastest-growing markets for Spotify, which had 615 million
active users
globally, including 239 million premium users and 388 million ad-supported users as of March 2024.
Live Events
Spotify India competes with JioSaavn, Amazon Prime Music, Google Music, Apple Music, Gaana, and
Airtel
's Wynk.
The audio streaming platform follows a hybrid ad and subscription-based model in India as majority of the music content is commoditised.
For the quarter ended March 2024, Spotify expanded its ad business, Spotify Audience Network (SPAN), into five new markets, including India.
In an earlier interaction with ET, Spotify India MD Amarjit Batra said the platform’s focus in the first five years was to build a strong user base in the country.
""In parallel, we have made Premium more accessible and relevant in India through our subscription plans that range from a day to a year, and from student plan to family plan,"" Batra said.
In its 2023 annual report, Spotify said it has significant net operating loss carry-forwards in India of €117 million (Rs 1,057 crore).
India has an audio streaming base of 185-200 million as of 2023, according to a FICCI-EY report on media and entertainment. However, paid subscriptions reached only 7 million due to commoditisation of music content.
As audio OTTs start pushing subscription plans, the paid customer base is expected to double to 15 million in 2026, the report said but noted that availability of free music on radio and YouTube will remain a big stumbling block in growing the audio OTT base.
The report also said low profitability of audio streaming platforms could lead to consolidation or platform shutdowns in the medium term.

“The idea is to make sure that the core business (visual effects) continues to do what it does and step up investments in two new areas, which are content and
technology
,” Malhotra said.
Prime Focus Studios is currently co-producing multiple films, including Animal Friends, Indian epic Ramayana and The Angry Birds Movie 3, Malhotra said, adding that the studio will ramp up investment in IP creation across formats.
The studio had recently co-produced an animation feature film, The Garfield Movie, which collected $240 million at the global box office.
DNEG’s turnover for 2023-24 stood at Rs 3,524.55 crore, which was 82.81% of the consolidated turnover of Prime Focus. The company earned almost 95% of its revenue from overseas markets, with India contributing the rest.
In a separate regulatory filing, Prime Focus said it had transferred shareholding in its cloud-based software and AI tech subsidiary, Prime Focus Technologies, to DNEG, effective July 1.
Brahma
, which aims to democratise photo-real content creation, will be headed by NaMa Capital's Prabhu Narasimhan as its executive chairman. NaMa Capital is a leading investor in DNEG.
DNEG’s Abu Dhabi hub will serve as a front-end for the group, displaying its global capability in visual effects, animation and gaming. The company’s aim is to develop an ecosystem in West Asia for
content production

Kalki 2898 AD
has buoyed the Indian film
box office
market by garnering over Rs 350 crore in domestic and over Rs 500 crore in global box office collections including India.
According to film trade website
Sacnilk
, the film grossed Rs 369 crore domestically and Rs 146 crore from overseas markets in the first four days since its release on June 27.
The film, which draws inspiration from Hindu mythology and features
Amitabh Bachchan
,
Kamal Haasan
,
Prabhas
,
Dulquer Salman
,
Deepika Padukone
, and Disha Patani, is the first major blockbuster hit of 2024 in an otherwise underwhelming first half due to a lack of big releases.
As per Ormax Media, the cumulative domestic box office collection stood at Rs 3,791 crore between January and May, with Fighter and Hanu-Man being the only films to gross over Rs 200 crore at the box office.
Experts believe that Kalki has done well across segments and markets due to its star power, strong content, and high-quality production value.

""Kalki is doing well not just in metros but also in non-metros. The film has a healthy mix of star power and content. The production quality and the VFX are also very good,"" said film trade analyst Taran Adarsh.
While concurring with Adarsh, Elara Capital SVP Karan Taurani said the film could collect box office collections of up to Rs 700 crore domestically and up to Rs 900 crore worldwide.
Cinepolis India MD Devang Sampat said the footfalls of cinema, though 15% below the pre-pandemic level, will remain at the same level in 2024 and 2023.
""The footfalls in the first half have remained at the same level as in 2023. In the second half, films like Kalki, Pushpa 2, and Singham Again are expected to drive footfalls,"" he noted.
According to Ormax, the total cinema footfalls stood at 943 million in 2023, compared to 1.03 billion in 2019.
Miraj Entertainment MD Amit Sharma said Kalki is the second biggest Telugu film opening ever after Baahubali 2. ""Kalki is undoubtedly a pan-India film, considering its diverse cast from the Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, and Tamil film industries. The movie has done fantastic business overall.""
Experts note that the second half of the year will see a rebound of the box office after a lull in the first half due to the Indian Premier League (IPL), the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, and the general elections.
""The content line-up looks promising across both Indian and Hollywood films. We have strong franchise-based films like Pushpa 2 and Singham Again. There are other mid-budget movies that could do well,"" Taurani added.
Adarsh said it's difficult to predict the box office numbers for the second half due to the volatile nature of the film and exhibition industries.
""With upcoming releases like Sarfira, Indian 2, Bad Newz, and Deadpool and Wolverine in July, the box office numbers should remain strong, similar to the performance we saw last year in August,"" said Miraj Entertainment’s Sharma.

Entertainments posted a Rs 85 crore net profit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, compared with a loss of Rs 22 crore in the previous
financial year
, according to the company’s latest regulatory filings.
Revenue rose 2.3 times to Rs 300 crore from Rs 130 crore in FY22, the filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs showed.

Live Events
Queries sent to Red Chillies remained unanswered at press time Thursday.
The company had premiered Darlings, a co-production with Alia Bhatt, directly on Netflix in August 2022. Prior to that, it premiered Love Hostel, featuring Vikram Massey, Sanya Malhotra and Bobby Deol, on ZEE5 in February 2022.
The films were released directly on OTT due to the third Covid-19 wave, which impacted the theatrical release of films.
It has also ventured into OTT production and produced shows like Class of 83 and Bard of Blood for Netflix.
The company has a subsidiary, Red Chillies International, and two step-down subsidiaries: UK-based Winford Estates and UAE’s Frontstage Entertainment FZ-LLC.

In its annual report, Red Chillies said Hartley Capital, the current preference shareholder of Winford Estates, has legally committed to subscribing to additional preference shares for a consideration of £1.5 million.
The company also stated that Khan's son, AbRam Khan, has subscribed to two preference shares for £1 million.
Red Chillies' secured and unsecured loans totalled Rs 416 crore at the end of FY23, up from Rs 355 crore a year earlier. The unsecured loans were provided by the company's directors.

NBDA seeks Andhra Pradesh government's intervention in channel blackouts by cable operators,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/nbda-seeks-andhra-pradesh-governments-intervention-in-channel-blackouts-by-cable-operators/articleshow/111233409.cms,24-06-2024,"The News Broadcasters and Digital Authority (
NBDA
) has urged the Chandrababu Naidu-led Andhra Pradesh government to ensure that all broadcasters are allowed to operate without interference in the wake of the blackout of four news channels,
Sakshi TV
,
TV9
,
NTV
, and
10TV
, by the cable TV operators.
The Cable TV Operators Association of Andhra Pradesh affiliated members have blocked the carriage of signals from Sakshi TV, a member of the NBDA, and three other news broadcasters, namely, TV9, NTV, and 10TV for allegedly criticising Naidu's Telugu Desam party (TDP).
""NBDA seeks the intervention of the Government of Andhra Pradesh to urge the cable operators to review their stand and avoid a situation of confrontation that is neither in the interest of the stakeholders nor in the public interest.""
""No reasons have been attributed for blocking the signals of these channels, which is contrary to the TRAI regulations. It is alleged that the action taken against the channels is in connection with their reporting criticising the TDP, which defeated the incumbent Yuvajana Sramika Rythu (YSR) Congress Party in state-level elections,"" it added.
The NBDA said that the step taken by a few cable operators is not in the interest of broadcasters, the media, or the public and sets a dangerous precedent.

It added that political parties must recognise that broadcasters have the freedom to decide what to telecast, and such editorial freedom cannot be subject to any interference.
""Such interference would lead to the media losing its independence, and it would result in the violation of Article 19(1)(a) and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. The boycott of channels is not the way forward and alludes to a threat to the freedom of the press,"" the NBDA statement reads.
NBDA noted that such arbitrary action has far-reaching consequences for the business of the broadcasters, causing substantial daily losses while also significantly impacting the viewership adversely, thereby affecting the channel's ratings and consequently the advertisement revenue.
This situation also has long-term implications for the relationship between the broadcasters and the advertisers, the association said.

Apart from the awards, the big draw on Wednesday was Tesla CEO Elon Musk in conversation with WPP CEO Mark Read.
Josy Paul, chairman at BBDO India, attended the event. He said, ""Musk was unlike anything I have seen in my 20 years at Cannes. Three venues (the main one and two where it was being aired) were packed. The queues to get in were long. One point that stood out for me was when Musk said that work would become optional and will make us question why we are here. It will give rise to an existential crisis - a crisis of meaning. I found that to be such an interesting term. Musk got philosophical and I have never heard someone speak about the present and future in such terms - it really was amazing.""
Musk said: ""I tend to agree with Geoff Hinton - one of the godfathers of AI - and he thinks there's a 10-20% probability of something terrible happening."" He added we needed to look on the bright side as the ""glass is 80% full"".
Speaking about brands who advertise on X (earlier Twitter), Musk said advertisers have a right to appear next to content that they find compatible with their brands. ""That's totally fine,"" Musk said. ""What is not cool is insisting that there can be no content they disagree with on the platform.""
Coming up
Other notable events included Alexander Chen, creative director at Google Creative Lab, and Alex Schultz, chief marketing officer and vice-president of Analytics for Meta.
Day 4 promises to be equally insightful, with Diana Frost, chief growth officer of Kraft Heinz, sharing her views on how legacy brands can be revamped for a new age audience.

Insta Empire tells the story of Naksh (played by Nishant), who lives as the poor son-in-law of a rich Indian family. Despite enduring insults and mistreatment from his in-laws due to his poverty, Naksh deeply loves his wife, Anika (played by Nayra). Their relationship strains when Anika decides to leave him for a wealthier man. However, Naksh has a hidden secret: he is actually the heir to Surat's richest family but was rejected and cast out after a risky decision. A twist of fate reveals his true identity, transforming him into an overnight billionaire and the owner of an Insta Empire.

India
started off strong on the first day of Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, touted as the Oscars of the ad-world, with one silver and two bronze Lions at the time of going to press.
Ogilvy Mumbai
won a Silver Lion in the Outdoor Lions category for their 'Megh Santoor' campaign for
Brooke Bond Taj Mahal tea
- an innovative musical billboard that played a rendition of 'Raag Megh Malhar' whenever it rained. Last year, the campaign also picked up a Guinness World Record for the largest environmentally interactive billboard.
India also shone in the health and wellness category, clinching two bronze Lions. One for Ogilvy's 'The Impossible Choice' campaign and the other for McCann's 'Fit my Feet' campaign. ""Our compassion-driven and design-led idea helps uplift individuals with clubfoot while also providing a new commerce stream to the cobbler community of India,"" said

Last year, the country grabbed 25 metals. Accenture Song's creative chairperson
Nick Law
kicked off the festival with their annual 'song simplifies' session.
""You need to make what the customer values valuable to the business,"" he told a packed auditorium. Fast-food giant McDonald's delivered a powerful session on elevating C-suite collaboration.

Rahul Mathew
, CCO, DDB Mudra India, on McDonald's CFO Ian Borden joining global CMO Morgan Flatley on stage.
The afternoon session saw advertising icon

blockbuster year
, with
box office collections
reaching Rs 720 crore in the first five months and four films grossing over Rs 100 crore each
According to
Ormax Media
, Malayalam films accounted for 19% of the cumulative box office collection of Rs 3,791 crore across India during the five months through May. Malayalam titles
Manjummel Boys
,
Aadujeevitham
: The Goat Life and
Aavesham
were among the top 10 grossing movies in the country during this period, according to Ormax Media.
As per several reports, another Malayalam movie, Premalu, also made more than Rs 100 crore in box office collections.

E4 Entertainment founder Mukesh Mehta, who has produced multiple Malayalam films, said films like Manjummel Boys, Aadujeevitham and Aavesham offered diverse stories to audiences.
""Every movie is different from the other, and there is no repetition of the subject. That has helped
Malayalam cinema
. Moviegoers got to watch different types of movies,"" he said, adding: ""We didn't have strong films in other languages like Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi. Hollywood releases were also impacted due to the writer's strike.""
According to Mehta, Malayalam movies have started doing well in North America and Europe after Covid-19. Within India, these are finding traction outside Kerala as well, he added.
As per the Ormax report, Malayalam, along with Telugu, got the second-highest proportion of the cumulative domestic box office receipts behind Hindi, which had a 33% share. In fact, Malayalam films, which are produced at much smaller budgets compared with movies in other South Indian languages and Hindi, took home a larger portion of the box office collections than Tamil, which held a 13% share.

""Malayalam cinema has had a slew of hits over the last few months, and some of the movies even touched the magic Rs 100 crore number, which was not a common phenomenon in Malayalam cinema until last year,"" said NV Capital cofounder Nitin Menon.
""Some movies like Manjummel Boys, Aadujeevitham and Aavesham have performed exceedingly well, and if this trend continues, 2024 would be one of the best years for Malayalam cinema and would possibly catapult this market next to Telugu cinema in overall collection and could also substantially boost the ancillary rights in the form of OTT,"" he added.
Till May, Manjummel Boys earned Rs 170 crore, followed by Aadujeevitham (Rs 104 crore) and Aavesham (Rs 101 crore), as per Ormax.
""The year 2024 is shaping up to be a landmark year for Malayalam cinema, with the industry having produced three films that crossed Rs 100 crore till now. Moreover, April 2024 is the first month ever in the history of Indian cinema where Malayalam emerged to be the highest grossing language, contributing 35% to the April 2024 domestic box office,"" said Ormax Media’s head of business development (theatrical), Sanket Kulkarni.

Paytm likely in talks with Zomato to sell movie ticketing business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/paytm-said-in-talks-with-zomato-to-sell-movie-ticketing-business/articleshow/111035291.cms,16-06-2024,"Paytm
is in talks with
Zomato
Ltd. to sell its movie and events ticketing business, according to people familiar with the matter, as the beleaguered fintech company carves a revival strategy amid weakening sales.
The discussions between Paytm, officially known as
One97 Communications
Ltd., and online food delivery firm
Zomato
are in advanced stages, though there are other suitors for the business, the people said, declining to be named as the matter is private. Talks are ongoing and no final decision has been made, the people said.
Paytm, run by billionaire founder-CEO
Vijay Shekhar Sharma
, last month reported its first sales decline on record, and vowed to trim non-core assets. It also warned of job cuts, reflecting the fallout from regulatory action on
Paytm
Payments Bank Ltd. that’s curtailed much of the fintech’s business and forced it to forge new partnerships with lenders.
Paytm does not control the bank but relied on it for digital wallets and payments traffic before the central bank’s move earlier this year.
Paytm and Zomato did not respond to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.

Paytm does not disclose standalone numbers for its movie and events ticketing business. It reported annual sales of 17.4 billion rupees ($208 million) in the fiscal year through March 2024 in its marketing services business, which includes movie and events as well as credit card marketing and gift vouchers.
The sale, if successful, will allow Paytm to sharpen its focus on travel, deals and cash backs - businesses that are important to broaden its merchant base and grow its own sales.
The purchase could help Zomato to expand its digital business into a new high-growth area. In 2020, it acquired Uber Technologies Inc.’s India food unit.

Delhi HC rejects Pocket FM's plea against Disney+ Hotstar,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/delhi-hc-rejects-pocket-fms-plea-against-disney-hotstar/articleshow/111010913.cms,15-06-2024,"The
Delhi High Court
has dismissed audio entertainment platform
Pocket FM
's plea seeking an interim injunction against Disney+ Hotstar's Telugu video web series '
Yakshini
' over alleged
copyright violations
.
Pocket FM had moved the court contending that Disney+ Hotstar's video series had many similarities with its audio series by the same name. The audio platform also claimed that it had given its audio series ‘Yakshini’ to Disney+ Hotstar for adaptation into a video series.
While dismissing Pocket FM's application, the vacation bench of Justice Neena Bansal Krishna said an interim injunction cannot be granted at this stage since no concrete facts have been established to prove that there is a copyright violation of expression of idea.
In its argument, Disney+ Hotstar said the idea for its web series has not been picked up from Pocket FM's audio series. It added that Yakshini is a popular mythological character about which abundant literature is available, and the video web series has been adapted based on the available literature.
The video streaming platform argued that Pocket FM had signed a 'release form' categorically stating that it would not claim any proprietary rights in all the works that it had earlier submitted to it while negotiating a deal.
Live Events
""The plaintiff (Pocket FM) may have prepared an audio series on this work, but there is nothing at this stage to say that the adaptation of the character of Yakshini in the video web series is almost similar or identical to the work of the plaintiff,"" the bench said in its order.
""The similarity of name cannot be the sole criteria, especially because it is a mythological character on which admittedly various works, movies and books are already available,"" it added.
Meanwhile, the bench has posted Pocket FM's main appeal for hearing on July 10.

Baahubali
movies were an unexpected phenomenon that brought Indian cinema back to the global stage after a long lull. However, whatever high-budget project the Baahubali star
Prabhas
has moved to next, controversy has followed.
The latest outrage has come after the first trailer for the
Nag Ashwin
sci-fi action film,
Kalki 2898 AD
, was released this week. While the film has already received flak from some for not delivering a trailer worthy of its astounding Rs 600 crore budget, the criticism reached an unexpected crescendo after a South Korean artist claimed that the movie blatantly copied some original elements from his artwork from a decade ago.
Kalki 2898 AD is a forthcoming epic science fiction film that promises to be one of India's most monumental cinematic endeavours. Headlined by Prabhas as Bhairava, an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, and Amitabh Bachchan portraying the ageless Ashwatthama, the film combines mythological themes with futuristic storytelling. It is one of the most expensive productions in Indian cinema.
The artist,
Sung Choi
, has worked as a concept illustrator for Marvel Studios, Disney, Warner Bros, and Netflix, among a host of other production houses. The illustration, called ‘Crash Site of ARK’, which seems to depict some sort of dilapidated structure amidst a desert-like scape, is morphed and added to the first shot of the trailer as it introduces the film’s production house,
Vyjayanthi Movies
.

https://www.instagram.com/sungchoiart/p/C8Ijj9PSfog/
Interestingly enough, this isn’t the first time a Prabhas-starred movie has found itself in hot water for
plagiarism
issues.
Adipurush
, another epic high-budget project steeped in controversy ever since its release, also faced backlash in 2022. According to animation house Vaanarsena Studios, T-Studios copied the studio’s artwork for the Adipurush movie poster that depicted Lord Ram in an action pose, demanding credit for the same.

Two years earlier, a song titled ‘Baby Won’t You Tell Me’ from the Prabhas-starred
Saaho
garnered controversy for using backgrounds that looked eerily similar to installations made by Bengaluru-based contemporary artist Shilo Shiv Suleman at the Burning Man Art festival in 2017.
Many were already disgruntled that Kalki 2898 AD drew excessive inspiration from many well-known franchises such as Dune and Mad Max, to the point that it almost seems like a sequel. After the fresh allegations, many netizens have urged Choi to pursue legal action against the production house. It remains to be seen if and how Vyjayanthi Movies will respond.

Graphic India's animated shows grab top spot on Disney+ Hotstar,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/graphic-indias-animated-shows-grab-top-spot-on-disney-hotstar/articleshow/110959676.cms,13-06-2024,"Graphic India

animated shows
,
The Legend of Hanuman
and
Baahubali: Crown of Blood
, have grabbed the top two positions on Disney+ Hotstar’s Top 10 show rankings for the country as of June 7.
In a statement, the company said that this is an unprecedented milestone for
Indian animation
, as there has never been a moment where two animated shows topped the Indian charts and surpassed all live-action productions.
Sharad Devarajan, the co-creator, producer, and showrunner of both shows, commented, ""Over the last two decades, my mission has been to recruit, train, and showcase India’s amazing artists, writers, creators, and disruptors at our studio with one defining mission: to help transform the perception of India in animation from being an ‘outsourcer’ to being ‘the source'—to create stories, heroes, and characters that are uniquely Indian but spark the imaginations of audiences all across both India and the world. That’s the goal of our company and the personal driving mission of my life. The rise of India’s animated pop-culture renaissance has just begun.”
Graphic India’s hit series, The Legend of Hanuman, previously reached the top spot on the streaming charts for each of its three previous seasons, becoming the only 3D-animated show to ever make the list.
The most recent Season 4 was launched on June 5th and quickly rose to the top spot on June 7. The Legend of Hanuman was created by Sharad Devarajan and Jeevan J. Kang, with a story by Devarajan, and directed and produced by Jeevan J. Kang and Navin John at Graphic India.

In just its first week, Season 4 received 6.1 million views, according to independent media consulting and data analytics group Ormax Media, which tracks viewership figures across the major Indian platforms.
Ormax also estimated that the previous season 3 of The Legend of Hanuman, which was released in January 2024, had 11.4 million viewers in the first 3 weeks of release and 3.4 million viewers in its first week.
Baahubali: Crown of Blood, originally launched on May 17, has repeatedly moved up to the numero uno spot on the platform since then, as each episode is released weekly.
Season 1 of the series is a trailblazer as the first original 2D-animated show to ever appear at the top of the streaming charts. The series was created by acclaimed filmmakers
S.S. Rajamouli
(‘RRR’) and Devarajan, produced by Rajamouli, Devarajan, and Shobu Yarlagadda, with a story by Devarajan, and directed and produced by Kang and John at Graphic India.
Ormax Media estimated that Baahubali: Crown of Blood had 11 million viewers in the first 3 weeks of release.
Creator of the Baahubali universe, S.S. Rajamouli, previously commented on the series, “The world of Baahubali is vast, and the film franchise was the perfect introduction to the same. However, there’s so much more to explore, and that’s where Baahubali: Crown of Blood comes into the picture. Arka Mediaworks and I are delighted to collaborate with Sharad Devarajan, Disney+Hotstar, and Graphic India as we reshape Indian animation for a broader audience beyond kids.”
At this year’s Annecy conference, Graphic India will be announcing its more aggressive push into theatrical animation, with a number of projects in development.
The company recently announced a new English-language animated film called “Cinnamon,” with acclaimed author and creator Neil Gaiman.
Based on Gaiman’s short story about an Indian princess and talking tiger who journey into a fantastical jungle, the film will mark a return to animated film from the creator of the Academy Award-nominated Coraline.
The screenplay is being adapted by Gaiman and Devarajan, with Sarena Khan and Sujatha SV. It will be directed by Kang.

"TVF to venture into films, plans to make sci-fi & horror shows, says originals head Shreyansh Pandey",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tvf-to-venture-into-films-plans-to-make-sci-fi-horror-shows-says-originals-head-shreyansh-pandey/articleshow/110817558.cms,08-06-2024,"Mumbai: After delivering successful
shows
such as ""
Panchayat
"", ""
Gullak
"" and ""
Kota Factory
"",
content creation
studio
The Viral Fever
(TVF) plans to foray into
films
while also exploring genres like
horror
and thriller in the long format, says the company's Originals Head,
Shreyansh Pandey
.
TVF
, which began as a
YouTube
channel, has become one of the most successful companies in the Indian
streaming space
, churning out relatable stories from different corners of India whether it is ""Panchayat"", a drama set in the rural space, or ""Gullak"", which revolves around a middle class family in small town India. The company's first show as ""Permanent Roommates"" in 2014.
""Kota Factory"", another of their shows, explores the reality of competitive exams aspirants, trying to improve in the many coaching centres of Rajasthan's Kota city.
""We will keep making shows to entertain people. The next exciting step in our journey would be to make films. There are a couple of films that TVF content studio is working on. We are doing a lot of homework. We are in the process of starting new stuff,"" Pandey told
PTI
in an interview.
""For our shows, we'll do more genres, while dramas will remain at the core of it. The same goes with feature films, where we will have both simple stories and movies of spectacle and scale. There are
sci-fi
, horror and thriller (shows). We are trying to come up with next season of 'Gullak' soon, it is a family story on which people keep showering love,"" he said,
Pandey also teased more seasons of ""Panchayat"" and ""Kota Factory"" as well as the sophomore chapter of sports drama ""Sixer"".
Live Events
TVF produced 15 shows in 2023 and the company plans to produce even more in 2024, he added.
""We hope to do more shows. We've a list of 35 to 40 shows which are in different phases of development, pre-production to production, and how much of it gets executed is a factor of many things.""
Pandey, who serves as a creator of ""Gullak"", said the anticipation around the fourth season, which was released on
SonyLIV
on Friday, makes him nervous but he is also proud about the show.
He revealed the series was initially planned as a YouTube show for the channel
Screen Patti
but SonyLIV decided to license it for its platform.
Starring Geetanjali Kulkarni, Jameel Khan, Vaibhav Raj Gupta and Harsh Mayar, the show centers on a middle-class Mishra family as they navigate life in a nondescript town in
Uttar Pradesh
.
""When you are making season four of the title, then you're always confused how much of it has to be new or how much of it has to be a return from the love for the characters and the universe that you've built,"" said Pandey, who also makes his debut as a director with ""Gullak 4"".
Writing is the most difficult job, the creator-director said, adding that the team spent close to two years to finalise the script for the new season.
""The only way to do it right is to go over your script again and again, rewrite it, and narrate it to a bunch of people. Our strength comes from the litmus test wherein we are narrating scripts to our creative forum, that's within TVF.
""We derive our confidence and learnings from that, we take feedback, we rewrite and incorporate and narrate again (to the team).""
Recalling the 14-long year journey of TVF, Pandey said it has been ""very exciting, incredible and happening"" and they are proud to have created at least 20 fan-favourite shows.
He also expressed gratitude to the audience for their unending love.
""The love pouring in, the subsequent seasons getting made, the memes that flow, the characters that people start loving, all these are matrix for us to believe that the story is working and the characters are being loved by people. But celebrating the journey of a protagonist is important for a storyteller, you've to believe in your story,"" he said.
Pandey said initially there were people who questioned whether viewers would be willing to pay to watch their TVF's content on YouTube.
""Those constructive interference or questions helped us broaden the content pipeline. We've always believed in the idea of trying to push the envelope and make something new,"" he said.

TV channel rates may soon go up by 5-8%,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tv-channel-rates-may-soon-go-up-by-5-8/articleshow/110676105.cms,07-06-2024,"MUMBAI: TV subscription rates for consumers are expected to rise by 5–8% due to an increase in bouquet rates by broadcasters such as
Disney Star
, Viacom 18,
Zee Entertainment
, and
Sony Pictures Networks India
, according to industry officials.
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
TRAI
) had asked broadcasters not to switch off signals to distribution platform operators (DPOs) who don't sign agreements as per the new tariffs till the general elections get over.
In January, leading broadcasters raised their base bouquet rates by 10%, with
Viacom18
going for the highest increase of over 25% due to the addition of Indian cricket rights and increase in the market share of general entertainment channels. The new pricing was to come into effect in February.
With polling coming to an end on June 1, broadcasters are expected to push DPOs to increase rates. Some DPOs like Airtel Digital TV have already increased prices marginally.
""Consumer-level pricing is likely to go up by 5–8% due to a price hike by the broadcasters. The real impact of the price hike will be visible in FY25,"" said Karan Taurani, SVP at Elara Capital.

A senior official at a leading broadcaster said, ""The consumer-level ARPU will go up by 5–8%. This is a nominal increase since the cost of acquiring and producing content is also going up.""
The official added that the DPOs are offering growth to broadcasters depending on the strength of their content. ""Broadcasters who have seen a decline in market share or lost out on key cricket properties will not get the growth they are seeking,"" he said.
In its Q4 earnings call on May 15, Bharti Airtel MD and CEO Gopal Vittal said revenue of the company's DTH arm grew in FY24 due to an increase in subscriber base and a moderate price hike.
""On an annual basis, after two years of decline, we grew our customer base by over 200,000 net adds, making us the only operator in the industry to grow customers during this year. We also rolled out a moderate price hike in the quarter, which was due to broadcasters raising prices and contributed to revenue growth,"" Vittal said.
According to the FICCI-EY report, Pay TV average revenue per user (ARPU) rose by about 4% to Rs 274 per month (gross of taxes). TV subscription revenue stood at Rs 40,000 crore in 2023.
DPOs affiliated with All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF) are resisting the price hike due to the likelihood of an increase in subscriber churn.
A top official at another media firm said most DPOs have signed the agreement except those affiliated with the AIDCF.
""Customer churn is a reality, but that can't be used as a justification against the price hike. Customer churn is happening even without a price hike. At least, increasing prices will ensure that the absolute revenues don't go down,"" he added.
Zee Entertainment is expecting healthy growth in subscription revenue in FY25 amid headwinds in the ad market. The company's subscription revenue grew 10% to Rs 3,666 crore, driven by the price hike.
""We are hopeful that with a conducive pricing policy framework in place, there will be an opportunity to drive gradual growth in subscription revenues,"" Zee CFO Rohit Gupta said during the company's Q4 earnings call.

Sony eyeing M&A opportunities in India post termination of Zee deal: Tony Vinciquerra,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/sony-eyeing-ma-opportunities-in-india-post-termination-of-zee-deal-tony-vinciquerra/articleshow/110567948.cms,30-05-2024,"Sony Pictures Entertainment
(SPE) is in discussions for potential merger and acquisition (M&A) deals in
India
after the collapse of its
merger deal
with
Zee Entertainment
, the company's chairman and CEO
Tony Vinciquerra
said during its Business Segment Meeting 2024 today.
The SPE boss also said that the merger deal between its India unit,
Sony Pictures Networks India
(
SPNI
), and Zee couldn't go through due to
regulatory issues
and the deterioration of the Indian entertainment giant's financials.
""We have several other conversations (M&A) going on right now that could or might possibly end up in something that will help us in the marketplace. We are not concerned about our survival, as we have a very good business there. We will survive, and we will do well,"" Vinciquerra said in response to a question about the company's strategy in India following the
failed merger
deal with Zee.
Apart from the failed merger with Zee, SPE's India arm had also held discussions with
Viacom18
in 2020 to combine the two businesses.
Of late, the industry has also been abuzz over the possibility of a strategic alliance between Sony and
Kalanithi Maran
's
Sun TV Network
. Experts believe the Sony-Sun deal is logical due to minimal overlap, as Sony primarily operates in the Hindi Speaking Market and Sun TV is a dominant player in South India.

In the past, private discussions between two companies ended in a stalemate due to both parties' unwillingness to relinquish control, say sources aware of those discussions.
Sony terminated its merger with Zee over alleged unfulfilled conditions by Zee and the dispute over the leadership of the proposed merged entity. The company has also sought $90 million in termination fees from Zee. The latter has also asked Sony to pay $90 million in termination fees over the failed merger deal.
""The Zee situation would have been great. It took a very long time to get regulatory approval, and within that time, unfortunately, the Zee business deteriorated quite substantially,"" he added.
In January, SPNI MD & CEO NP Singh had told employees that the company would pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen its position in the Indian market.
Vinciquerra also said that the company is considering multiple candidates to replace its incumbent CEO, NP Singh, amidst media speculation that the company has already zeroed in on his successor.
""We just announced that our CEO is retiring, and we are looking to replace him very aggressively. We have a long list of very good candidates that we can choose from to lead that business,"" he stated.
According to Vinciquerra, the merger between
Reliance Industries
' Viacom18 and
Walt Disney
's Star India will give the company some time to re-establish its India business.
""We have a very large competitor who is merging with another of our large competitors. The regulatory process will probably take some time, which we think will give us some opportunity in that short time to reestablish and reenergise our business to compete very strongly,"" he said.
According to financial data sourced from Tofler, SPNI, which is now known as Culver Max Entertainment, reported 11% growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 1042 crore in FY23.
The company, which operates 26 TV channels and the SonyLIV streaming platform, recorded revenue of Rs 6684 crore, a 0.66% decline from last year.

How did Payal Kapadia’s historic win at Cannes lead to a showdown between Shashi Tharoor and PM Modi? Here’s the complete timeline,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/how-did-payal-kapadias-historic-win-at-cannes-lead-to-a-showdown-between-shashi-tharoor-and-pm-modi-heres-the-complete-timeline/articleshow/110496370.cms,28-05-2024,"Mumbai filmmaker
Payal Kapadia
has recently graced our news after winning the ‘Grand Prix’ — the second-most prestigious award at the 77th
Cannes
International
Film Festival
. This award was won by an international co-produced film called ‘
All We Imagine As Light
’, a 115-minute-long drama written and directed by Kapadia herself.
While the win has directed much discourse towards the current state of Indian cinema, it also spurred another surprising detour towards a controversial avenue after the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) decided to congratulate Kapadia on her well-deserved win. Here’s the entire tea.
How did it start?
The story goes back all the way to 2015, while Kapadia was still a student at FTII — India’s oldest and most premiere film board that is also under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. With a legacy of appointing many prestigious filmmakers as its president, such as the legendary Mrinal Sen and Shyam Benegal, the institute settled on the decision to appoint Gajendra Chauhan as its next chairman.
Many FTII students protested the move as felt betrayed by this appointment. They claimed that Chauhan had not played any significant part in Indian entertainment industry, with him acting as Yudhishthira in the 1980s
Mahabharat
being his most prominent role. They claimed that Chauhan lacked the expertise and credentials to assume such a pivotal role at the esteemed institution, with some even even painting the move as a political ploy to saffronise yet another of India’s major institutions. The students feared that this appointment would hinder the artistic freedom and creative liberty that was erstwhile celebrated at the campus.
In response to the nomination, a Kapadia-led group of students allegedly organised a 139-day mass protest that involved boycotting classes, even trapping the then-Director Prashant Pathrabe in his office until more clarification was provided. To say that this revolt was not taken lightly would be an understatement.

After the office confrontation, the police were called to stifle the protest and 35 students were charged with various crimes, of which Kapadia and few other students faced the strictest charges. Academic “disciplinary action” was carried out after the arrests of Kapadia and four other protesters – a case still unresolved by the Indian courts. This involved depriving Kapadia and several other students of a scholarship and the chance to participate in foreign exchange programs, in addition to vacating them from their hostels. Many of these students were also demonised by Chauhan supporters, branding them as ‘anti-nationals’ and the like.
FTII softens stance
While the charges still remain unwavered, Payal Kapadia refused to allow these harrowing circumstances to hinder her artistic productivity. Channelling the dissent around her, Kapadia made a documentary titled ‘
A Night of Knowing Nothing
’, a 2021 documentary about a university student writing letters to her estranged lover in the backdrop of the FTII student protests.
This film premiered at Cannes, the Toronto International Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival the same year. The docu-film was subsequently awarded prestigious awards at many of these events.
However, this was hardly Kapadia’s first brush with international fame. In 2017, ‘
Afternoon Clouds
’, a 13-minute-long film about a 60-year-old Mumbai widow and her Nepali domestic help, was selected for screening at the Cannes International Festival. Recognising this, FTII issued a letter of support, offering to cover Kapadia’s travel expenses to the prestigious film festival.
FTII faces backlash for congratulating Payal
After Kapadia’s historic win at Cannes this year — an award that made her the first Indian filmmaker to win the Grand Prix — the FTII congratulated the alumna on X, a move criticised by many.
The post read: “It is a moment of pride for FTII as its Alumni create history at Cannes. As we witness a phenomenal year for Indian Cinema at 77th
Cannes Film Festival
, FTII cherishes the glorious achievements of its Alumni at this Mega International Stage of Cinema.”
— FTIIOfficial (@FTIIOfficial)
Since their official statement, many prominent celebrities have called the FTII out on their hypocrisy. These personalities deemed that the institute was trying to claim credit for Kapadia’s international success, despite its behaviour towards her and other dissenters in the past.
Ali Fazal, other personalities react to FTII celebration
Ali Fazal
, known for his role in 3 Idiots, also criticised FTII for celebrating Payal Kapadia's Cannes win. The actor responded to the FTII congratulatory post with the caption ‘Uhhh… please don’t. Just don’t’.
— alifazal9 (@alifazal9)
In addition, sound designer Resul Pookutty, who won an
Oscar
for
Slumdog Millionaire
, also called out the FTII for celebrating Payal's win. On Facebook, the personality explained that Kapadia's win at Cannes highlighted a significant gap in the Indian film industry's support for independent filmmakers. While the Government of India's annual delegations to Cannes predominantly feature familiar faces from the mainstream industry, Kapadia's success underscores the importance of recognising and supporting passionate individuals from diverse backgrounds, Pookutty asserted.
PM Modi congratulates Payal, Shashi Tharoor reacts
Soon after Kapadia’s win, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also took to X to congratulate the filmmaker. He writes: “India is proud of Payal Kapadia for her historic feat of winning the Grand Prix at the 77th Cannes Film Festival for her work ‘All We Imagine as Light’.”
— narendramodi (@narendramodi)
The PM also highlighted Kapadia’s background as an alumnus of FTII, explaining that her new prestigious accolade will continue to inspire a new generation of Indian filmmakers.
However, many have pointed out that Kapadiy’s earlier four-month-long institutional struggles arose from the Government’s decision to appoint Chauhan as the FTII chairman. Chauhan is also a noted BJP leader, belonging to the same ruling party as PM Modi. Some netizens also responded to the post urging that the party make Chauhan apologise to the filmmaker.
In a separate post, Congress leader
Shashi Tharoor
demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdraw all cases against Kapadia and the other FTII students who protested the appointment of the institute’s chairperson in 2015. Sharing a post from Resul Pookutty, which alleged that Payal would have to attend a court hearing regarding the FTII incident soon after returning from Cannes, Tharoor reprimanded the Prime Minister for his hypocrisy in applauding her success.
— ShashiTharoor (@ShashiTharoor)
We’ve all dealt with terrible authority figures. Unfortunately for the newest pride of Indian cinema, her adversary ended up being the institution and government itself. However, Payal’s ardent ferocity helped the filmmaker overcome systemic obstacles that would topple most. While Kapadia has expressed gratitude towards FTII for helping fund earlier movies, it remains to be seen how court hearing will unfold further for the talented director.

What happened to our ad-free TV?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/what-happened-to-our-ad-free-tv/articleshow/110445049.cms,27-05-2024,"Not long ago,
streaming TV
came with a promise: Sign up, and
commercials
will be a thing of the past.
Netflix
rose to streaming dominance in part by luring customers to an
ad-free experience
.
Amazon Prime Video
, Disney+ and
HBO Max
followed that lead.
Well, that did not last long.
Ads are getting increasingly hard to avoid on streaming services. One by one, Netflix, Disney+,
Peacock
, Paramount+ and Max have added 30- and 60-second commercials in exchange for a slightly lower subscription price.
Amazon
has turned ads on by default. And the live sports on those services include built-in commercial breaks no matter what price you pay.
The importance of
advertising
was driven home this month when Amazon and Netflix both staged their first in-person presentations during the so-called upfronts, a decades-old television event in New York where media companies try to woo advertisers.

Netflix
dispatched Shonda Rhimes, the successful executive producer of ""Bridgerton"" and creator of ""Grey's Anatomy,"" to talk up the service to marketers. Amazon packed its event with celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon and Jake Gyllenhaal, and a live performance from Alicia Keys.
""Remember when streamers told you, 'We're going to do television a new way, so I'm afraid we won't be needing your little commercials anymore,'"" Seth Meyers, the ""Late Night"" host, told advertisers at one of the events this month. ""Cut to a few years later, every episode of 'Shogun' is interrupted by 'Whopper, Whopper, Double Whopper!'""
Or as one frustrated consumer vented on social media this past week: ""Why am I paying for Prime Video and getting all these commercials? It is beginning to get annoying.""
Representatives for Netflix and Amazon declined to comment.
Perhaps the changed viewing experience was inevitable. Over the past decade, as media companies raced to introduce streaming services to compete with Netflix, they prized
subscriber counts
above all else.
There was just one problem: profits.
The companies bled money, and Wall Street soured on their businesses. So executives are turning back the clock. They are ordering lower-cost, old network standbys such as medical dramas, legal shows and sitcoms. They are offering bundled packages to make consumers less tempted to click on the cancel button. (Disney+, Hulu and Max will team up later this year, for instance.) And they are embracing commercials, as a way to increase revenue.
Consumers can still avoid most of the ads, for a price. Most streaming services still have an ad-free version, including Amazon, which requires subscribers to pay an extra $3 a month to skip the ads. Apple TV+ continues to offer only an ad-free experience.
The commercial tiers, however, are becoming more essential to their business. There were at least 93 million ad-supported streaming subscriptions in the United States at the end of last year, according to estimates from Brian Wieser, an industry analyst, and Antenna, a subscription research firm. In the wake of Amazon's automatic switch to advertising, and more ad-tier customers picked up by other streaming services, Wieser and Antenna estimate that there are at least 170 million
ad-supported subscriptions
now.
Through the first three months of 2024, 56% of new subscribers to a streaming service chose the lower-priced ad-tier, according to Antenna. That was up from 39% a year earlier, the firm said.
Executives have tried to assure subscribers that while advertising is back, it won't be as overwhelming as in traditional television.
Just a few years ago, an episode of a prestige basic cable drama such as Ryan Murphy's ""American Crime Story"" was interrupted by 21 minutes of commercials. But ads take up far less time on streaming services. For instance, on Disney+, the average amount of time for commercials is four minutes per hour. On Hulu, it's just over six minutes.
""There was always this notion that people don't like ads,"" said Rita Ferro, the president of ad sales at
Disney.
. ""I don't think that's true. People don't like bad advertising or a bad advertising experience.""
In the data-rich streaming world, she argued, the advertising experience is better informed than it was on traditional television, and the company knows what a person's viewing preferences are and ""what products are relevant to you,"" she said.
Wieser, the analyst and founder of the consulting firm Madison and Wall, said he expected that even with ads running on streaming services, overall ad revenue would continue to decline for media companies. He projects that the amount of time spent watching ads on television - both streaming and traditional network and cable TV - will fall by 24% by 2027 compared with last year.
Part of the reason, he said, is that many people will continue to pay extra to avoid ads on services like Netflix. ""The vast majority of Netflix subscribers will never choose an ad-supported option of any price,"" he said.

Indian films are making a comeback in Russia,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bollywood-back-in-russia-after-a-long-break-more-indian-films-being-screened-shot-in-the-country/articleshow/110406904.cms,27-05-2024,"New Delhi: Several generations of Russians grew up watching subtitled
Indian films
and were floored by
Raj Kapoor
,
Mithun Chakraborty
,
Hema Malini
and Shah Rukh Khan years ago. Industry players and authorities are working to reignite the old cultural affiliation by increasing
film shoots
and screenings of Indian films in
Russia
.
Sarfaraz Alam Safu, who runs
Kartina Entertainment
, a line production company for Indian films in Russia and CIS countries, said Indian
filmmakers
are showing increasing interest and his company was the line producer for some recent films including Sardar Udham, Pathan, Tiger, and Jugjugg Jeeyo that were shot there.
“I am also working on a film, which is a biopic of Rakesh Sharma (the first Indian in space) to be shot here, which will be produced by
Siddharth Roy Kapoor
,” Safu said. “Companies such as
Dharma Productions
,
Excel Entertainment
,
Emmay Entertainment
,
Rohit Shetty Productions
, and many more are in touch with us for several projects,” he added.
Local authorities are hoping to attract more Indian filmmakers this year through discounted production costs.
“We are now like the front office or supermarket of any services for filmmakers, as we are trying to cut their production expenses as much as possible by offering a low price to shoot here,” said Evgeny Kozlov, first deputy head of the office of the mayor and the government of
Moscow
.
Live Events
Upcoming Tamil action film ‘The Greatest of All Time’ last month became the first foreign film to be shot as part of the ‘Moscow-City of Cinema’ programme that provides subsidies to filmmakers.
“I hope we will see several
Bollywood
projects from India being shot this year in Moscow,” Kozlov said. “We have started working deeply with
Bollywood
firms to invite Bollywood filmmakers to the Moscow cinema cluster. My colleagues from the Moscow Department of Culture who are responsible for attracting filmmakers are also trying to establish connections with Bollywood filmmakers.”
Kozlov is also the chairman of the Moscow City Tourism Committee.
Meanwhile, more Indian films are being
screened
across Russia.
Besides Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Indian films are being screened in over 40 locations in the country including Arkhangelsk, Belgorod, Kazan, Penza, Saratov, Tula, Ulyanovsk, and Cheboksary.
Mirzoyan Karen Rudolfovich, a general producer of Indian films in Russia, said he is hoping Indian films will capture about 20% of the Russian films market in the next four to five years, up from less than 5% now.
“Hollywood made a lot of investments in popularising their actors in Russia. That’s missing for Indian films,” said Rudolfovich, who has been working on Indian projects for the past eight years.
“We work with production houses such as Red Chillies and Dharma Productions, and our company purchases the rights of Indian films to screen them in Russia,” he said. “I think the Russian audience will be able to relate more to the storyline of Indian films as opposed to
Hollywood
, if more efforts are put here. We want to screen Indian films in more halls and theatres in Russia.”
Abhishek Anand, a Russian language translator and interpreter, who also acted in a recent Indian film shot in Russia, said the older generation of Russians have a totally different emotion for Indians as they were very fond of actors such as Raj Kapoor.
“But films such as Pathan, Pushpa, Bahubali and RRR have also done well here,” he said. “Pathan was shot here and there is a Russian dialogue in the film that resonated very well with the audience here.""

"Reliance, Disney seek India antitrust nod with cricket rights assurance",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/reliance-disney-seek-india-antitrust-nod-with-cricket-rights-assurance/articleshow/110370580.cms,23-05-2024,"Reliance Industries
and
Walt Disney
have sought antitrust clearance for their $8.5 billion
India media merger
by arguing their combined power, especially on
cricket broadcasting
, will not hit
advertisers
, two people with direct knowledge told Reuters.
The deal, announced in February, has been expected by experts to face intense scrutiny as it will create India's biggest
entertainment player
with 120
TV channels
and two
streaming services
. It will also own lucrative rights for cricket, India's top sport.
Reliance and Disney have told the Competition Commission of India (CCI) the cricket rights were obtained separately under a bidding process which was competitive, said the two sources, who declined to be named as the approval process is confidential.
The companies argue other competitors won't be harmed as they can bid when those rights expire in 2027 and 2028, the sources added.
The CCI will now review the confidential filing. Though any clearance typically takes several weeks, it can take longer if the watchdog isn't satisfied and seeks more information.

Reliance, Walt Disney and the CCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Disney and Reliance currently own digital and TV cricket rights worth billions of dollars for the world's most valuable cricket tournament the Indian Premier League, International Cricket Council matches and those of the Indian cricket board.
That has raised concerns the merged entity could have high leverage over advertisers and consumers, with K.K Sharma, a former head of mergers at CCI, saying in March the regulator could be concerned as ""hardly anything of cricket will be left"" as Disney-Reliance will have ""absolute control over cricket"".
Jefferies
has estimated the
Disney-Reliance entity
will command a 40% share of the advertising market in TV and streaming segments.
The companies have told the CCI in their filing there will be no impact on advertisers as cricket-watching consumers can be targeted on many rival platforms where they also consume content, including YouTube and Meta, the sources said.
Similarly, the companies have said, Indians consume content across TV channels, social media and streaming apps, and advertisers will not be disadvantaged by the deal.
""The lines are blurring (between TV and digital). Companies target by demographics. If they don't like ad rates on the Disney-Reliance entity, they can always target a consumer"" elsewhere, said the first source.
The deal is set to reshape India's $28 billion media and entertainment market, where the Reliance-Disney combo will compete with
Netflix
,
Amazon Prime
,
Zee Entertainment
and Sony.

New Pirates of the Caribbean movies unlikely to feature Johnny Depp as lead,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/new-pirates-of-the-caribbean-movies-unlikely-to-feature-johnny-depp-as-lead/articleshow/110298157.cms,21-05-2024,"From Willie Wonka to Edward Scissorhands,
Johnny Depp
has an impressive arsenal of characters under his belt, with no two portrayals anything like the other. And yet, one role has constantly reigned far above the rest in popularity, forever changing cosplay conventions worldwide. We’re talking about
Captain Jack Sparrow
, of course.
Depp’s portrayal of Jack in the
Pirates of the Caribbean
movies has helped the
franchise
reportedly gross a staggering $4.5 billion globally. Being such a pivotal and unique character, it would undoubtedly feel odd watching the movies without Johnny Depp reprising his role. And yet, that could very well be the plan for the franchise going forward, it turns out.
Complete reboot of the franchise
According to media reports, two more Pirates of the Caribbean films are in production, with a complete reboot on the table for the franchise. Unfortunately for Depp die-hards, this may also mean that the character will no longer play the main role in future installments.
Much of this ruling stemmed from the infamous Depp v Heard defamation trial in 2022, following which there have been speculations that
Disney
has maintained their distance from the actor. Johnny Depp himself has expressed that he felt “deeply hurt” by Disney’s subsequent decision to cancel the sixth
movie
.
Will Jack Sparrow return?
However,
Jerry Bruckheimer
, producer of all five previous Pirates of the Caribbean films, has conveyed eagerness to bring the actor back to the franchise.

""It's a reboot, but if it was up to me, he would be in it,"" Bruckheimer told Entertainment Weekly. ""I love him. He's a good friend. He's an amazing artist and he's a unique look. He created Captain Jack”.
Even if Johnny Depp returns to his prodigious role, it is unlikely that the upcoming two movies will feature him as the lead. Bruckheimer has insinuated that a Margot Robbie-centered Pirates movie will likely receive production priority, perhaps due to the billion-dollar success of the recent Barbie movie. A script is being developed for the other reboot movie, with
Dead Men Tell No Tales
writer
Jeff Nathanson
at the helm.
""I think he's cracked it,"" Bruckheimer remarked on Nathanson’s script so far. ""He's got an amazing third act. We just gotta clean up the first and second and then we'll get there. But he wrote a great, great third act.”
As the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise sails into uncharted waters, fans can only speculate on what the future holds. However, with talents like
Margot Robbie
potentially steering the ship and Jeff Nathanson's promising script developments, the franchise is poised for an exciting evolution. One thing is certain: the spirit of Captain Jack will forever be a guiding star on the horizon of pirate adventures.

Investors will take final call on Zee leadership: Punit Goenka,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/investors-will-take-final-call-on-zee-leadership-punit-goenka/articleshow/110254917.cms,20-05-2024,"MUMBAI:
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
managing director and chief executive
Punit Goenka
said he has not discussed his reappointment with any shareholder, even as his five-year term is set to end in December.
""So, at the end of the day, it is the
shareholders
who will decide whether I am the right person or not, or whether somebody else needs to lead this company,"" Goenka told analysts during the company's Q4 earnings call on Friday.
Domestic institutional
investors
own a 35.56% stake in the company as of March 2024. Some of the top investors include
ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund
and
HDFC Mutual Fund
.
Goenka, who is part of the promoter family that holds a 4% stake, is the longest-serving CEO of Zee. In 2019, Goenka was reappointed as the MD and CEO of the entertainment giant, beginning January 2020.
The
Securities and Exchange Board of India
is investigating Goenka and his father,
Subhash Chandra
, for allegedly diverting the entertainment company's funds to promoter-owned firms.
Live Events
In August 2023, the capital market regulator passed a confirmatory order against Goenka and Chandra, barring them from holding directorships or top managerial roles in Zee.
The Securities Appellate Tribunal lifted
Sebi
's ban order against Goenka in October last year while allowing the regulator to continue its probe against the Zee promoters.
The
Sebi investigation
against Goenka was a key reason for the failure of the
merger deal
between Zee and
Sony Pictures Networks
India.
Sony
was averse to having him as the CEO of the proposed merged entity and instead wanted its executive,
NP Singh
, to lead it.
Sony terminated its merger agreement with Zee in January this year. Recently, Zee also withdrew its application from the
National Company Law Tribunal
that sought the implementation of the merger agreement.
""This decision (withdrawing the petition) will enable the company to sharply focus on growth and strategic opportunities in order to generate higher value for all shareholders,"" Goenka said, adding that the company will continue to contest Sony's $90 million termination fee demand before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
Goenka said his single-minded focus is to ensure that the company achieves its 18-20%
Ebitda target
by FY26. Zee has terminated 15% of the staff and cut down investments in the technology centre and content, as part of efforts to reduce cost.
""We have been implementing a series of steps since the latter half of the quarter, the results of which will reflect on the bottom line in the financial year 2025,"" Goenka said.

PVR Inox looks to grow pre-ticketing F&B biz post its JV with Devyani,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pvr-inox-looks-to-grow-pre-ticketing-fb-biz-post-its-jv-with-devyani/articleshow/110232317.cms,18-05-2024,"PVR Inox
's
joint venture
(JV) with
Devyani International
will help the company pivot from being a pure-play
cinema exhibitor
to also having a large role in the booming
food and beverage
(F&B) segment, a top company official said.
The
multiplex operator
recently inked a JV with Devyani International, which runs quick-service restaurants (
QSRs
) like KFC and Pizza Hut. Devyani will own 51% of the JV, with PVR holding the remaining 49% stake.
Speaking to analysts during the Q4 earnings call, PVR Inox executive director Sanjeev Bijli said the JV will allow the multiplex chain to grow its pre-ticketing F&B business.
Currently, it earns most of its F&B revenue post-ticketing, which is only when a consumer buys a movie ticket.
""We felt this partnership was a win-win one because we get to have some F&B revenues, which are pre-ticketed. We can get the opportunity to come up with some
branded food courts
,"" Bijli said.
Live Events
He noted that most shopping malls lack branded food courts, and PVR Inox, which attracted 150 million moviegoers in FY24, can add value in this area.
The branded food courts are expected to help PVR increase its wallet share among existing consumers.
In FY24, PVR Inox's revenue from the sale of F&B jumped 21% to Rs 1958 crore, while F&B spend per head rose 11% to Rs 132.
PVR Inox will bring value to the JV in the form of negotiating better rental deals and locations with
real estate developers
. The food courts will be located adjacent to PVR Inox cinemas.
While declining to comment about the investments being made by the JV, PVR Inox CFO Nitin Sood said the initial plan was to open 5- 6 food courts. ""We are still in the process of developing a long-term business plan.""
Bijli said the exit quarter of FY24 was soft due to the impact of the general elections on new movie releases and the underwhelming performance of Hindi films. In FY24, PVR Inox recorded the lowest quarterly collections of Rs 759 crore in Q4 due to box office volatility.
The company is expecting box office collections to improve post-elections due to a strong slate of Hindi and Hollywood movies.
PVR Inox is also transitioning to a capital-light model by reducing overall capex in FY25 by 25% from Rs 700 crore in FY24. The company is planning to install 120 screens at the gross level. The net screen addition is expected to be 50–60, as it is looking to phase out 60–70 screens.
The company is also adding screens through franchise-owned company- operated (FOCO) model under which the developer will make the entire investment in the cinema property while PVR Inox will generate revenue through management fee.
PVR Inox is looking to monetise real estate assets worth Rs 300–400 crore that it inherited from the Inox merger. The proceeds from the sale of real estate assets will be used to pay off debt.

""Anime is a global favourite for early teens. Very little content is made for that age segment,"" said Uday Sodhi, senior partner at digital strategy consulting firm Kurate Digital Consulting. ""OTT platforms need to start seriously looking at anime content.""
ET Bureau
Sony Group Corporation-owned
Crunchyroll
, which is dedicated to anime content, set up shop in India last year by incorporating a wholly owned subsidiary and earmarking an initial investment of $10 million.
The platform has over 800 anime titles in India with 8,000 hours of content. Over 70 shows have been dubbed in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu. Globally, Crunchyroll has 13 million paid subscribers.
Prime Video Channels
, the OTT aggregation arm of Prime Video, launched Animax + Gem and Anime Times last year to cater to a growing anime
audience
base in the country.
Recently,
JioCinema
launched a dedicated Anime Hub as part of its premium offering priced at '29/month. The platform will provide real-time global releases and a library of hundreds of hours of top anime titles.
""Over the past few years, there has been a significant growth in the popularity of anime in India, with this genre attracting a considerable fandom owing to its captivating storytelling and visually striking animation,"" a JioCinema spokesperson said.
Disney+Hotstar and
Netflix
, too, have a good amount of anime content in their libraries.
Other OTT platforms, too, are expected to explore anime content due to its potential.
In an earlier interview with ET, Crunchyroll president Rahul Purini had said India is the second largest anime market in the world after China and is growing very fast. ""In the regions where we are present, India would be the largest market in terms of potential audience. We expect 60% of the global anime growth to come from India,"" he had said.
The Crunchyroll head said 53 million Indians watch anime content from official sources. He also stated that the anime audience is split 60:40 between males and females.

Universal Music Group plans to expand India play,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/universal-music-group-plans-to-expand-india-play/articleshow/109989382.cms,10-05-2024,"Universal Music Group
(
UMG
) plans to expand its
India
business through both organic and inorganic routes as the country is expected to enter the top 10 music markets globally in the coming years from being the 14th largest
music market
currently, its chief executive for Asia, Africa, and the
Middle East
,
Adam Granite
, told ET.
“We will continue to look for M&A opportunities here in India and across all of our markets where it makes sense,” he said, adding that the company is talking to many companies in multiple markets.
In India, UMG is looking to
acquire companies
across the music ecosystem, including
labels
and
catalogues
. “Music has to be a central piece of the company,” Granite said.
As per the financial data sourced from
Tofler
, UMG subsidiary
Universal Music India
's revenue in FY23 was Rs 555 crore, with a net profit of Rs 72 crore.
Apart from India, the music company sees
China
as another important market. “There are two markets we talk about most often, and that would be China and India. But India is one of our key markets and one of our key vocal points for growth,” the CEO said.
Live Events
In 2022, UMG’s India arm acquired a majority stake in
TM Ventures
, a leading music and entertainment company.
Subsequently, the company inked an exclusive partnership with leading talent management company Represent. The company also has an existing global distribution deal with Punjabi record label Desi Melodies.
As per the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, music revenue increased 10.2% year-on-year to $28.6 billion in 2023. India ranked 14th in the global music market.
According to a FICCI-EY report, the Indian music market expanded by 10% to reach Rs 2,400 crore in 2023, slower than previous years as certain music over-the-top platforms shifted to the pay model.
“Over the next five years, we would like to see India move well into the top 10. And over time, it should certainly be in the top five, but that is going to take a lot of market dynamics to also shift,” Granite said.
The UMG CEO said the Indian music market must transition from a free to a paid model to realise its true potential. “For the market to grow into that upper echelon and upper tier of revenue markets, it’s going to have to evolve into more of a paid market,” Granite said.
As part of its next phase of growth, UMG has elevated Sanujeet Bhujabal to managing director and Viral Jani to chief revenue officer of Universal Music India and South Asia. Both Bhujabal and Jani will work closely with UMG India and South Asia chairman Devraj Sanyal.

's maiden profit from
streaming entertainment
in Q2 may be short-lived as the segment is expected to experience a
Q3 loss
due to International Cricket Council (
ICC
) digital rights, which are held by Disney+
Hotstar
.
""We are forecasting a loss for entertainment direct to consumer (DTC) in the third quarter, the vast majority of which is due to Disney+ Hotstar's ICC
cricket rights
,"" Walt Disney CFO
Hugh Johnston
told analysts during the earnings call for the quarter ended March 30.
He added that Disney+'s core subscriber growth is not expected to be significant in Q3, but sub-growth is anticipated to return in Q4.
Walt
Disney
's streaming entertainment services, comprising Disney+ and
Hulu
, recorded a maiden profit of $47 million in Q2. The company's sports streaming service, comprising ESPN+, reported a $65 million operating loss.
The aggregate operating loss from the streaming portfolio including entertainment and sports stood at $18 million during the quarter.
Live Events
Walt Disney CEO
Bob Iger
, who was brought back in November 2022 to shepherd the company out of difficulty, said the company expects a weaker Q3, owing in large part to the seasonality of Indian sports rights.
""We fully expect streaming to be a growth driver for the company in the future, and we have prioritised the steps necessary to achieve this,"" he noted.
Star India
, which is the parent company of Disney+ Hotstar, has paid $3 billion for the ICC media rights until 2027. The value of ICC TV and digital rights is split almost equally.
The ICC TV rights for the 2023-27 cycle were sublicensed to
Zee Entertainment
by Star India. However, the failure of the merger deal with
Sony Pictures Networks India
forced Zee to back out of the expensive cricket rights deal.
Star has initiated arbitration proceedings against Zee with the
London Court of International Arbitration
for failing to fulfil the ICC TV rights agreement.
Zee has contested Star's charges of breach of contract, claiming that the agreement is null and void due to the latter's decision to broadcast ICC matches on its TV channels.
The Walt Disney-owned company's valuation took a hit due to the likely losses it will incur from the ICC media rights deal over the next four years.
In February, Walt Disney and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) agreed to merge Viacom18 with Star India, becoming a $8.5 billion media conglomerate.
Star will be de-consolidated from Disney's global earnings once the merger is complete.
The merger deal values Star at slightly more than $3 billion, which is significantly lower than Walt Disney's expectations. Star India, which Disney acquired from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, is estimated to have been worth more than $15 billion at its peak.
In a quarter when Walt Disney's streaming business turned a maiden operating profit of $47 million, Star India's streaming service Disney+ Hotstar saw a 6% QoQ and 32% YoY drop in subscriber base to 36 million.
Disney+ Hotstar's average monthly revenue per paid subscriber also decreased 45% QoQ to $0.70 due to lower advertising revenue. Disney+ Hotstar is available in India and certain other Southeast Asian countries.
The platform's average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased 19% YoY to $0.70 due to increases in retail pricing, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers from lower-priced markets and lower advertising revenue.

Movie theatres cut down shows as films fare poorly,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/movie-theatres-cut-down-shows-as-films-fare-poorly/articleshow/109864586.cms,07-05-2024,"ET Intelligence Group
: Lack of curiosity-inducing line-up of
films
and poor performance of already-released big-budget movies such as ‘
Bade Miyan Chote Miyan
’ and ‘
Maidaan
’ have compelled
multiplexes
and single-screen
theatres
to cut down on the number of
shows
or shut some screens temporarily. According to various estimates of trade analysts, two to three screens in a multiplex containing five screens, or a single-screen theatre containing five to six auditoriums have been temporarily shut due to poor
business
and large expenses associated with running them.

“Shows are being cancelled. I think theatres which contain five to six auditoriums are running only two to three auditoriums,” said Manoj Desai, producer and executive director of Mumbai-based
G7 multiplex
and the iconic
Maratha Mandir
movie hall. “It is not just about the general elections, the heat wave or competition from streaming platforms. Filmmakers are making bad films. And
viewers
are not interested in them.” He added: “Earlier, when
Hindi films
did not work, there was a supply of
South Indian films
dubbed in Hindi which provided some business to theatres. But this time we do not even have southern films dubbed in Hindi.”
According to trade analysts, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan has been made on a budget of Rs350 crore. It has collected Rs48.50 crore in the past three weeks. Maidaan, which had a budget of Rs250 crore, has collected Rs40 crore in the same period. “Single-screen theatres and multiplexes are grappling with very little
collections
. There are theatres which have meagre footfalls of 170-250 people,” said independent film distributor and trade analyst Shaaminder Malik. “Single-screen theatres in
Agra
, Bareilly, Kanpur and Lucknow have
reduced
their ticket prices to a low range of Rs 30-70. Even then, there is no improvement in footfalls.”
Apart from reducing ticket prices and providing fixed ticket coupons for a certain number of films, to lure audiences to multiplexes, exhibitors are also running advertisement-free shows (this saves at least 30 minutes for the audience) at premium properties.
Malik said: “Today, word-of-mouth communication among viewers and potential viewers of films is more effective than ever. One cannot dump bad films and expect people to come to theatres, especially at a time when they have more interesting avenues to entertain themselves. The success of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a proof that the audience wants to come to theatres and watch good films.”

Poor collections have made running full shows at a multiplex unviable, given the high fixed costs. In recent years, it has been observed that the average fixed cost of a large multiplex was 55-56% of its total costs. Fixed costs contain salaries, rent and common area maintenance (CAM) charges (maintenance fees of a property), electricity and water charges and other operating expenses.
A senior management executive at a leading multiplex said: “Rentals and CAM charges have increased post the pandemic. This has added to costs of running a screen. We used to pay an average 15% of the revenue generated per
screen
before the pandemic to theatre-owners. This average increased to 20%. So, poor performance of Hindi films is just a key trigger for temporarily shutting screens.

A revenge of the fifth: Recovering the lost ‘antriksh ke veer’ through AI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/a-revenge-of-the-fifth-recovering-the-lost-antriksh-ke-veer-through-ai/articleshow/109845292.cms,05-05-2024,"Every Wookie worth his body hair knows that yesterday, May 4 was
Star Wars
Day. You must have waved your light sabres and greeted each other with the traditional line, ‘May the Fourth be with you.’ But the card-holding Jedis among you will know that today, May 5, is when you greet each other with ‘Revenge of the Fifth!’
Because as Phuket-based German
AI
artist Oliver Huber knows, it’s today that production of an unfinished
George Lucas
meets - Manmohan Desai space opera-Bollywood cult classic started production. As Huber writes, ‘What most people don’t know: In 1974, Indian
Bollywood
director Rajat Kumar started filming ‘
Antriksh Ke Veer
’ (Space Heroes). Sadly, the project was shelved due to budget constraints. The script was later sold to an American guy called George for 500 rupees.’ Huber is custodian to iconic images from the never-released cult classic. There’s the Harrison Ford-resembling swashbuckling Hari Solan, captain of the ramshackle space freighter Millennial Fantoosh trying out some inner peace in a loud satsang. Hari’s ‘mardangi moustache’ makes him the bumbling action veer of this film.
Agencies
There’s Lokesh Saiwalker, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Mark Hamill from Star Wars – wielding, no, not a light sabre, but a cricket bat as he tackles the Dark Side. Darth Gabbar is seen frolicking with the village belles, while Princess Leela – the resemblance to Carrie Fisher is uncanny – is the garrulous, spunky ladki burning up the kitchen in a benarasi in one image, and nursing a hangover by having more daaru in another.
And then there’s everyone’s favourite Wookie, Chewkakka, who takes the spotlight in almost all the item number scenes. Soon enough, Huber comes around and tells me the real deal: these are images he created using AI software.
Live Events
Agencies
Agencies
‘For the images, I used Midjourney V6, which is an exciting tool still in its alpha phase,’ the artist explains from his Thai office. ‘It’s fascinating to see how it’s evolving, particularly in its ability to interpret and execute text prompts. When necessary, I give the images a final touch-up in Photoshop to bring everything together.’
Agencies
The mash-up of Star Wars and Bollywood is compelling. Which planetary system did that start off ? Huber explains how as a kid in Germany, he was ‘absolutely captivated’ by the Star Wars universe, collecting everything associated with the George Lucas movies — from action figures to the soundtrack on vinyl.
‘My introduction to Bollywood came much later,’ he says. ‘It was like stepping into an entirely new world of storytelling. Friends of mine introduced me to ‘Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham’, and I was instantly taken by the vibrant storytelling, which was so different from what I grew up with in Germany.’ That experience sparked a six-week adventure in India, in which he immersed himself in ‘the culture that inspired these films’.
In a way, the heady Star Wars-70s Hindi cinema Huber concoction was written in the, well, stars. ‘I’ve always been drawn to movies that break away from the mainstream – the more surreal, the better. Bollywood films definitely fit that bill for me. And let’s not forget my love for the design and vibes of the 70s.’ When creating the ‘Antriksh Ke Veer’ series, Huber wanted to blend all these elements — nostalgia of Star Wars, exuberance of Bollywood, and the retro-aesthetic of the 70s.
‘It was like mixing my favourite childhood memories with my love for cinematic adventures from around the world.’
Agencies
After moving to
Thailand
a few years ago, Huber started a business in architectural LED lighting. ‘It was a great experience and taught me a lot about running a business. But I was always on the lookout for ways to feed my creative side. That’s when AI caught my eye.’ The creative possibilities it opened up for him were ‘just mind-blowing’.
Agencies
His main focus now is ‘Synthography’, a term for AI-generated images that mimic real photographs. He describes it being all about creating moments that blur the line between reality and imagination.
This interest soon turned into a new business venture. Huber now runs a company that specialises in creating custom visuals for small and midsize businesses. “It’s a blend of art and technology that keeps things fresh and exciting.”
He goes into George Lucas mode explaining how the process begins with a basic sketch of the idea — outlining the character, setting, attire, accessories, and even facial expressions. From there, it’s all about finetuning the details. ‘It’s a bit like being a director and a photographer at the same time,’ he says, ‘guiding the AI to capture a scene just as I envision it.’ Who knows? The images from ‘Antriksh Ke Veer’ may get someone from the film industry to put in money and finish the project that was started a long time ago in a dhaba-turned studio far, far away…

"With string of Hollywood hits, Warner Bros. Discovery sees highest ever box office collections in India, says country head Arjun Nohwar",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/with-string-of-hollywood-hits-warner-bros-discovery-sees-highest-ever-bo-collections-in-india-says-country-head/articleshow/109793761.cms,02-05-2024,"Riding on the success of Barbie, last year’s biggest movie that grossed over $1.5 billion in box office collections worldwide, including being the “highest ever non-dubbed” English film in India,
Warner Bros.
Discovery’s (
WBD
) stellar run seems to continue this year with theatrical hits like
Godzilla X Kong
: The New Empire already crossing Rs 100 crores in India collections, making it the highest grossing Hollywood film in the first four months of 2024.
The top 3 Hollywood films for 2024 in India including
Kung Fu Panda 4
and Dune 2 are all from the WMD stable or are distributed by the company, said its top executive of the region.
Together the trio have already grossed over Rs 175 crores in theatres in the country so far. These films made it to the top 10 films for the month of March, as per Ormax, a media consulting firm. This, in a market, where Hollywood productions (including dubbed versions) contribute just a tenth of all-India films.
“With people coming back in droves to theatres, we are seeing 100 percent increase in box office collections for us, and it's the highest ever that WBD’s theatrical and distribution teams in India has ever recorded in terms of revenues,” said Arjun Nohwar, GM, South Asia, Warner Bros. Discovery.
In 2023, with Rs 630 crores gross box office (GBO) collections for Warner Bros. and Universal films, the company cornered over half of the market share. Building on that momentum, though still early in the year, in the first 4 months WBD has dominated the space with more than 90% of the market share in India with Rs 200 crore GBO to date.

Dubbing popular titles into regional languages have helped WB & Universal films to appeal to masses. In 2023, close to 60% of box office billings for FastX came from dubbed versions while the original English version contributed 41% of sales. For Godzilla x Kong, 21% of sales have come from Tamil Nadu alone, when there were no Tamil films in the Top 10 movies of March. ""The popularity of these films is not restricted to the theatres,” said Nohwar. “These films can also be watched on the
Jio Cinema
platform when released subsequently.”
Instead of launching its own streaming service Max (formerly HBO Max) in India, last year WBD signed a content licensing agreement till 2026 with Jio Cinema last April to showcase its original movie and shows catalogue that includes Succession, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series among others on Reliance’s app. The development came a month after WBD parted ways with its long time digital partner Disney+ Hotstar. Earlier in 2020, HBO ceased to exist as a linear movie channel across the pay TV universe in the Indian subcontinent.
Despite the theatrical successes of its international movies, WBD is not keen to immediately revive its production arm in one of the largest movie markets in the world after an unsuccessful attempt in 2010-11. Nohwar, however, said it cannot be “ruled out in the near future.”
Following the 2022 spin off of Warner Media from AT&T and merger with Discovery Inc, the priority has been on profitable growth. That influenced the original decision of launching Max – the 2
nd
most profitable streaming service globally after Netflix -- in India on hold and opting for a strategic content partnership with Jio Cinema instead to tap into their “400 million plus subscriber base.”
Nohwar however remains non-committal if the company is planning to launch Max locally once the time bound agreement ends with Jio , simply saying we will “evaluate” what is the right India thesis for us -- Launching Max, or a partnership or “ by continuing to license.” The challenge he says is to feed a platform with enough local content for it to be a local success, but simultaneously achieve scale and a healthy balance sheet.
WBD, in India, is a unique media conglomerate as it straddles 5 different businesses - more than any of its global peers present in the country. Its largest vertical is the network operations that beams 19 feeds or channels such as Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, TLC; Kids channels like Cartoon Network, Pogo, Discovery Kids; Sports broadcast with Eurosport and its News platform, CNN.
The second vertical is the streaming platform, discovery+ third is the theatrical business that releases, markets and distributes Warner Bros. and Universal Studios movies, while the fourth is the TV distribution and licensing business that licenses shows to OTT players like Jio Cinema. Merchandising or Consumer Products, and Gaming is the smallest but fast growing vertical.
“Our greatest strength is our ability to monetize our collection of content in multiple ways through a broad distribution strategy designed to optimize asset value. For instance, we have continued to leverage partnerships locally with players such as Jio, Tata Play Binge and Dish TV Watcho to expand the reach and engagement of the discovery+ platform”, adds Nohwar.
The company continues to invest in Indian originals for their linear and streaming platform, discovery+. “Our investment in Indian originals is geared towards boosting engagement, expanding market share and solidifying our position as the leading network for non-fiction content in India”, says Nohwar. “It’s equally strong even across the network on account of the large global Indian diaspora.”
Talking about media consolidation around the world including India, Nohwar said a lot of this has to do with concentration of capital and the flight of some of that across different markets. Disney chose to consolidate its global operations and as a part of that merged its India business with Mukesh Ambani led Viacom 18.
“India has seen its own fair share of mergers closing and some of them as near misses (Read: Zee-Sony). When we look at the Indian landscape, we will look at opportunistic partnerships that would help us to profitably expand our presence in the market.”

The streaming giant, with over 38 million paid customers and 500 million app downloads, introduced free mobile streaming of major sports events like the Asia Cup and the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, followed by the Pro Kabaddi League in 2023.
Before streaming these events for free, Disney+ Hotstar had kept live sports behind the paywall. However, rival JioCinema's free sports streaming of premium properties like the FIFA World Cup and Indian Premier League (IPL) prompted it to follow suit.
Disney+ Hotstar's free strategy for live sports has yielded significant results, as it attracted a record number of viewers for the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023.
As per the platform's internal analytics, it achieved a significant reach during the marquee 50-over tournament, with over 550 million unique users tuning in to the platform during the tournament.
Furthermore, the tournament was live-streamed on Disney+ Hotstar by 295 million unique viewers, representing 61% of the Indian OTT universe. The tournament reached 57 million unique viewers on 16.2 million CTV devices.
The platform also set back-to-back peak concurrency records as a result of the free mobile streaming, with the final match between India and Australia establishing a global record of 59 million peak concurrent users.
Disney+ Hotstar is seeking sponsorship outlays of Rs 80 crore, Rs 55 crore, and Rs 30 crore from co-presenting, powered-by, and associate sponsors, respectively, for the event.
It is demanding spot rates of Rs 13 lakh per 10 seconds for mobile and Rs 6.5 lakh per 10 seconds for CTV. For just India matches, the 10-second rate goes up to Rs 35 lakh and Rs 18 lakh on mobile and CTV, respectively.
The live mid-roll cost-per-thousand-impression (CPM) rates for the entire tournament are Rs 230 and Rs 500 per 10 seconds for India and play-off matches. For CTV, the CPM rates are Rs 480 and Rs 1050 per 10 seconds for the entire tournament and India matches, respectively.

JioCinema may disrupt SVOD market with low pricing plan,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jiocinema-may-disrupt-svod-market-with-low-pricing-plan/articleshow/109573025.cms,25-04-2024,"Viacom18-owned
JioCinema
is set to disrupt India’s
subscription
video-on-demand (SVOD) market with one of the industry's lowest pricing plans for premium
content
.
Beginning April 25, JioCinema Premium will offer
Indian
and
Hollywood
entertainment content at an introductory tariff of Rs 29/month for a single device and Rs 89/month for up to four devices, the company said. This comes close on the heels of the success of its free strategy in the advertising VOD space.
Live sports and catch-up broadcast content will continue to be available for free, the company said, adding that JioCinema, like other broadcast-owned
OTT
(over-the-top) platforms, will use a hybrid monetisation strategy.
The new pricing is a significant drop from its Rs 999/year and Rs 99/month plans, which offered only Hollywood content. Unlike the existing plans, the new plans will be
ad-free
, the company said.
JioCinema Premium will provide users with web originals, movies and content for children, along with Hollywood content from HBO, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global.
Viacom18
's linear TV content will also be made available before the broadcast premiere.

The company’s new tariff plan will hot up competition with Disney+ Hotstar, Netflix and Prime Video, which collectively have 50–60 million subscribers.
""The new pricing is a sharp reduction for an ad-free experience. They are providing more content over and above the Hollywood content and charging less for this,"" said Elara Capital’s senior vice president Karan Taurani.
He said JioCinema Premium will impact the SVOD industry negatively since the Indian Premier League (IPL), the most premium media property, continues to remain outside the paywall.
""The SVOD players will not be able to increase average revenue per user due to JioCinema's aggressive pricing,"" he said.
Experts say the move marks JioCinema's pivot towards a hybrid monetisation model, and the ongoing IPL cricket tournament provides the perfect launch pad for it to implement its new pricing.
Viacom18’s CEO-Digital Kiran Mani said JioCinema Premium's goal is to redefine premium entertainment for Indians. “The introduction of JioCinema Premium breaks the numerous cost and quality barriers that exist in accessing premium entertainment,"" he said.
In a recent note, Taurani had said that JioCinema’s revenue for FY24 is estimated at Rs 2,700 crore, based on Network18's financials for the last financial year.
JioCinema has been offering premium Indian content across entertainment and sports channels for free. The platform has built a strong advertising business on the back of free streaming of impact properties like IPL and Bigg Boss.
JioCinema's free sports streaming has had a cascading effect on the industry, with OTT market leader Disney+ Hotstar also offering the Asia Cup, 2023 ICC Men's World Cup, and Pro Kabaddi League for free to mobile users.
Barring Netflix and Prime Video, most of the large OTT players, including Disney+ Hotstar, ZEE5 and SonyLIV, have a hybrid monetisation model.
In September 2022, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the amalgamation of JioCinema, which was owned by a Reliance Industries subsidiary, into Viacom18.
Viacom18 is in the process of merging with Walt Disney-owned Star India to create a $8.5-billion media behemoth. The merged entity will have JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar, two of the strongest OTT apps in the country.

""With ‘Dish TV Smart+’ Services, we are catering to all needs of a modern Indian family, staying true to our motto - Naye Bharat Ka Smart Connection,” Dobhal added.
A Ficci-EY report showed that the domestic pay TV market lost two million subscribers in 2023 and as a result bundled services are being considered by
traditional TV distribution
platforms as a means of retaining lost customers to OTT.
Notably, for a long time now, telecom providers
Bharti Airtel
and Reliance Jio have been bundling data and content. Tata Play, a
DTH provider
, is one of the standalone players that bundles OTT and linear TV services for customers under a single bill.

In recent years, this Bollywood superstar has stepped onto a bigger stage – one where the spotlight shines on environmental and climate awareness. In a world where the spotlight often blinds stars to the sufferings of the planet and its people, Bhumi reminds us that every person on this planet needs to keep that spark for eco-consciousness alive.

In an exclusive interview with Business Insider India, Bhumi Pednekar spoke about her struggles with eco-anxiety during her early years, her efforts to strike a balance between her professional career and environmental responsibilities, her advice for the younger audience, and her take on the climate action across the globe.

“When I started my climate journey, it was a very lonely path for me, Every time I spoke about it, people made fun of me. Eventually, through the years, I met like-minded people, and I realised that this is a real problem. Even today, I get really worried, I have bouts of anxiety and go into a spiral that you know, what will happen now and so on. In such times, what truly helps me is to actually do something towards dealing with the problem,” says Bhumi.
Acknowledging her efforts to spread awareness on these critical topics, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) named her as India's first National Advocate for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Just last month, the World Economic Forum (WEF) recognised her as a Young Global Leader (YGL). On
Earth Day
2024, she also joined UNDP’s global initiative called the ‘The Weather Kids’ — a global campaign to raise awareness about climate change and drive the world towards taking meaningful climate action.
Talking about the campaign Bhumi Pednekar stated, ""I’m deeply disturbed by Climate Change and the impact that it is having the world over. I have dedicated my life to working on this and helping raise awareness… I have always been committed to using my platform to raise awareness about the urgency of climate action and to empower individuals and communities to adopt sustainable practices. Together, we can make a difference and create a more sustainable and resilient world for future generations.”
Further, Bhumi’s role as a
climate warrior
has also seen her collaborating with activists and institutions nationwide, amplifying their voices and supporting initiatives focused on environmental preservation and climate action. As an ardent advocate for environmental and climate action, she has effectively utilised her fame to champion causes like waste segregation, rainwater harvesting, recycling, and conscious fashion choices.

“Climate Warrior, which is our nonprofit, is an advocacy platform I started in 2019. The idea was to bring all the work of creating awareness under one umbrella. And then we started the Bhumi Foundation, through which we are again just trying to streamline everything that we do, we have not opened it up for others to come in and work,” said Bhumi, encouraging younger generations to also find their own tribe to influence and drive change.
The theme for today’s World Earth Day 2024 is Planet Vs Plastic, and it is time for all of us to gauge our individual and collective impact on our environment and try to reduce it. “One big thing that we can do is to look for and support businesses that are trying to go green and create a positive impact on our planet. If investors support such businesses, and consumers pick such products, our carbon footprint can be lesser,” explains Bhumi.
“Every day is Earth Day. This is our only home, there is no alternative, and there is no plan B! The way we show empathy and sympathy towards our loved ones, we should show empathy towards everybody else that we share this planet with. It really breaks my heart when you see on the news that a major city like Bangalore is still witnessing a water crisis and our capital city Delhi has winter days where schools are canceled because of the pollution. We are all in this together, we all are a part of the problem. And we all need to be a part of the solution as well,” concludes Bhumi.

"Broadcasters seek tariff forbearance to help pay-TV compete with OTTs, others",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/broadcasters-seek-tariff-forbearance-to-help-pay-tv-compete-with-otts-others/articleshow/109495035.cms,22-04-2024,"Broadcast sector stakeholders have urged the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) to implement complete tariff forbearance to help the
pay-TV
industry compete with emerging and established platforms like over-the-top (OTT) and DD Free Dish.
Tariff forbearance will give the industry freedom to set prices for their services for consumers.
On April 18, Trai held an open house discussion to address issues in the consultation paper 'Review of Regulatory Framework for Broadcasting and Cable Services’.
During the open house discussion,
Reliance Jio
's Ravi Gandhi mentioned that tariff forbearance, like in the telecom sector, would help the broadcasting industry, stressing the importance of a fair regulatory framework.
The consultation paper, which was issued in August 2023, explored issues related to tariffs, interconnection regulation and quality of service.
Live Events
Bharti Airtel
's chief regulatory officer Rahul Vatts said the broadcast sector should have light-touch regulation, as is the norm internationally.
He noted that the telecom sector has expanded due to tariff forbearance. Additionally, he highlighted the disparity in regulation between the declining pay-TV business, subjected to stringent regulations, and the unregulated OTT business, which competes directly with pay-TV.
Tata Play
CEO Harit Nagpal said the industry was operating effectively before the implementation of the new tariff order (NTO), which mandated a standardised tariff for all distribution platforms.
He added that before the NTO, subscribers were charged according to their financial capability. However, with the introduction of the NTO, both affluent and less affluent consumers now bear the same expenses, Nagpal noted.
According to a Ficci-EY report, the total number of pay-TV households stood at 118 million in 2023 and is expected to decline to 83 million by 2030. The number of connected TV homes is expected to reach 100 million by 2030 from 35 million in 2023.
The broadcasters have stated that the network capacity fee (NCF) charged by the distribution platform operators (DPOs) from the consumers should not be increased and must be uniform across territories.
However, the DPOs have urged Trai to remove the Rs 130 monthly cap on the NCF and provide them flexibility to charge the customers.
On the issue of the 15% discount cap on the MRP of a-la-carte channels in a bouquet, the DPOs stated that they should be provided flexibility in forming bouquets.
Most of the DPOs have supported the idea of bringing DD Free Dish under the regulatory framework. However, some broadcasters feel that DD Free Dish should be left unregulated since it is a free DTH service.
Some stakeholders also stated that DD Free Dish should start encrypting channels in a phased manner.

SC sets aside NCDRC order for penalty on YRF for excluding promo song 'Jabra Fan',https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/sc-sets-aside-ncdrc-order-for-penalty-on-yrf-for-excluding-promo-song-jabra-fan/articleshow/109494375.cms,22-04-2024,"The
Supreme Court
on Monday set aside the order of the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
(
NCDRC
) which had directed the production house Yash Raj Films to pay Rs 10,000 as compensation to a consumer who was aggrieved by the exclusion of the song '
Jabra Fan
', from film 'Fan' starring actor
Shah Rukh Khan
.
A bench of Justices PS Narasimha and Aravind Kumar while delivering the verdict said that it has answered the questions of whether a 'promo' or a 'teaser' which is circulated before the release of a movie would create a contractual obligation and whether it was an unfair trade practice not to show the contents of the promotional trailer in the movie.
The detailed judgment will be uploaded on the apex court website later.
YRF
had approached the apex court challenging a 2021 NCDRC order passed on a complaint by one Afreen Fatima Zaidi, who was aggrieved by the exclusion of the song from the film when it was played in movie theatres.
Zaidi had complained that she was cheated as the song 'Jabra Fan', which was shown in the promos and trailers of the 2016 film 'Fan', was not played in the movie theatre.
Live Events
The counsel of Yash Raj Films (YRF) had contended before the apex court that the song 'Fan' was meant only for promotional purposes and the production house was under no obligation to include it in the movie.
YRF had said it was not a service provider and that the complainant had availed the 'services' of the cinema hall and not that of the production house and the business arrangement between the producer, distributor, and exhibitor of the movie has no relevance here.
The complainant had claimed that her children did not eat food on the night when they went to watch the film in the theater because they were disappointed as the song was not played at the theatre, which led to a spike in their acidity levels and hospitalization.
YRF had stated that the mere non-inclusion of the song 'Jabra Fan' has not caused any loss to the complainant and that the claims are exaggerated.
In the year 2017, while the District Consumer Forum had rejected the complainant's claim, the State Commission of Maharashtra allowed her appeal and ordered the production house to compensate her with Rs 10,000 along with a litigation cost of Rs 5,000. The NCDRC had also passed the order in favor of the complainant.

Amar Singh Chamkila: A wannabe electrician who was allegedly shot dead by Khalistani militants,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/amar-singh-chamkila-a-wannabe-electrician-who-was-allegedly-shot-dead-by-khalistani-militants/articleshow/109472188.cms,21-04-2024,"In 1979, a young man named Dhanni Ram, aged 18, from Dugri, a village close to Ludhiana, sought employment from Punjabi folk music icon Surinder Shinda. Previously attempting a career as an electrician without success, Dhanni, having acquired skills in playing the harmonium and dholki, remained hopeful about pursuing a career in music.
Within seconds of the lanky, 5-foot, 10-inch teenager reciting a song written by himself, Shinda knew he had found his ""shagird"" (a Punjabi word for pupil), and took him in his wings immediately.
Dhanni's talent for songwriting in Punjabi and his distinctive voice led to him sharing the stage with renowned folk music artists of that era such as K Deep and Mohammad Sadiq.
However, facing financial challenges, Dhanni took a bold step in 1979 and collaborated with female folk singer Surinder Sonia to produce his own album. The album quickly gained popularity and became a success almost overnight.
Dhanni Ram was dead.

Amar Singh Chamkila
- a folk singer who would regale rural Punjab with his raw, witty and controversial lyrics till he was gunned down by suspected
Khalistani militants
on March 8, 1988 - was born.
During his decade-long career as a singer-songwriter, Chamkila, often referred to as the ""
Elvis of Punjab
,"" captivated Punjab’s youth during a tumultuous period for the state.
Though many have criticized Chamkila for singing about extra-marital relationships, alcohol and drug use, and the bravado of the Punjabi man, according to his admirers his songs were only a reflection of society.
""They were an example of what was happening in Punjab at that time,"" said Gunjit Chopra, who was chronicling the life of the folk legend back in 2016.

""Double-meaning songs had been a part of Punjabi folk songs since the 1960s. What set Chamkila apart was his ability to connect with people and come up with songs that were real and raw.""
In what is an example of his evergreen popularity, a fair is held annually in Dugri to commemorate Chamkila on the anniversary of his death.
""People from all walks of life attend it. We have never even publicized it, but it has gained a lot of popularity,"" said Chamak Chamkila, who was Chamkila's pupil from 1984 to 1988.
At the peak of his career, Chamkila was performing three shows in a single day, said Ranjit Mani, who worked under Chamkila for a year, from 1987-88.
""His voice was soulful. Also, as he was from a place like Dugri, he knew what people at that time wanted to listen,"" Mani added.
""There were times when Chamkila was performing in a village and the roof of the houses around the venue would collapse because of the weight people on them.""
In a span of 10 years, Chamkila released 110 songs and many of them were yet to be released at the time of his death. As his popularity soared, Chamkila and his duet partner, Amarjot, whom he married later on, started doing tours of Canada, US, Dubai, and Bahrain.
But, Chamkila's popularity in a Punjab torn by communal strife and demand for Khalistan, came with its set of risks.
""He would get threats regularly,"" celebrated Punjabi music composer Charanjit Ahuja, who worked on Chamkila's first and a majority of his albums.
""In 1986, he stayed with me in Delhi for two months because he had been receiving constant threats. He was quite brave like that. Not much daunted him. He was scared for his life, but rarely ran away.""
Gunjit, who researched on Chamkila's life for five years said, the trend of duets singing folk songs in Punjab fizzled out after his death in 1988.
""There were attempts by the state government to revive folk singing in 1992, but not much came of it. The advent of cable TV was like the death knell for the art,"" he added.
A life riddled with controversies
Chamkila's life was marked by controversy, spanning from his music to his untimely demise. While the folk music icon faced criticism for composing songs with suggestive themes and explicit content, he also ventured into writing politically and religiously themed songs.
According to Chopra, Chamkila did not get the time to mature as an artist.
""He started off when he was a teenager and was killed at the age of 26. Probably that is why the content of his lyrics was boyish,"" he said.
""Had he been given more time, his age would have reflected in his music.""
Chamkila and Amarjot
released three devotional LPs after 1985 - Baba Tera Nankana, Talwar Main Kalgidhar Di Haan and Naam Jap Le.
Though the LPs were successful, none of the songs featured on them were written by Chamkila. Charanjit Ahuja, a celebrated Punjabi music composer who worked on many albums with Chamkila, says the folk music legend would have reached dizzying heights of stardom if destiny would not have been so cruel on him.
""It is difficult to describe how he would have done. But, if his popularity at that time is taken as a yardstick, it would have been quite a thing,"" said Ahuja.
According to many individuals who collaborated with Amar Singh Chamkila, the renowned folk artist was known for his kind and generous nature.
Ranjit Mani calls him a man with humility. ""He was never rude to anyone. In fact, he was very humble even when he had gained popularity. He was honest, just like his songs were an honest interpretation of society at that time,"" he said.
Shot dead at the age of 26
Amar Singh Chamkila's life was tragically cut short at the age of 26, in an unexpected turn of events. On a sunny afternoon of March 8, 1988, Chamkila, along with his wife and duet partner Amarjot, and two other band members, stopped their van for a concert in Meshampur village, Jalandhar. Suddenly, a group of youths on motorcycles arrived and fatally shot them all, leading to their immediate demise. The devastating incident sparked numerous speculations and rumors as news of the tragedy spread.
First, he was killed by Khalistani militants for singing songs that were lewd and explicit; second, other singers were jealous of his fame and got him killed through a contract killing.
However, no person has been arrested so far and his murder continues to be wrapped in mystery.

How AI-generated music is shaking up the industry and why artists are wary,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/how-ai-generated-music-is-shaking-up-the-industry/articleshow/109464715.cms,21-04-2024,"In April last year, ghostwriter977, a
TikTok
user, wrote and produced a song called “Heart on my sleeve”. It sounded just like the Canadian rapper Drake and the singer-songwriter The Weeknd. The song went viral, racking up 15 million views on TikTok and hundreds of thousands of views each on Spotify and YouTube. But neither Drake nor The Weeknd had a clue about the song.
They hadn’t sung a single line. Their vocals were generated by
artificial intelligence
(AI). The machine has moved on from synthesising sounds to generating singing voices. AI is on song everywhere.
Anshuman Sharma and Aditya Kalway, two young producers assisting the music composer duo SalimSulaiman, recreated “Haule haule ho jayega”—the hit song in Shah Rukh Khan’s Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi—in the voice of Mohammed Rafi. “We came across some AI vocal models that could produce the voices of Indian
singers
like Kishore Kumar, Rafi and Sonu Nigam,” recalls Sharma. In September 2023, Kalway sang “Haule haule” in Rafi’s signature style, put it through a vocal filter and musically arranged it like a 1970s LaxmikantPyarelal romantic ditty. Its Instagram Reel got 2.6 million views and cheers from the
music industry
, including Vishal Dadlani, Shaan and Sonu Nigam.
In January this year, composer AR Rahman strode into the AI ring. He used AI to generate the voices of Shahul Hameed and Bamba Bakya — two singers with whom he had collaborated but died, prematurely, in their 40s—for the song “Thimiri yezhuda” in the Rajinikanth film Lal Salaam.

AI is the new sound of music. A harbinger of change as well as confusion, it is shaking up the industry. While the technology’s potential is immense, artists are admittedly wary of their voices being cloned with the click of a few tools.
“2023 is when the AI-hype phase in music really took off,” says Valerio Velardo, a consultant in music and AI based in Andalusia, Spain. He founded Melodrive, an AI system that composes music in real time, in 2016, followed by the Sound of AI, one of the largest online AI music ecosystems. “We shifted from a symbolic generation to an audio-based generation,” he adds, referring to the shift from the use of symbols to create music—which a synthesiser or sampler does —to the use of audio files to train AI models to generate music. “This was a leap,” he says.
Indeed. It has come a long way from 1957, when the American composer and chemist Lejaren Hiller and the mathematician Leonard Isaacson programmed the Illiac computer at the University of Illinois at Urbana– Champaign to compose a string quartet. The Illiac Suite is widely regarded as the first score to be composed by a computer.
The use of artificial intelligence in music exploded with the entry of tech giants and powerful AI-first firms. One of the pioneers was OpenAI’s Jukebox. Released in 2020, it generated raw audio that approximated the inputs you gave like a certain musician or a particular genre.
Google came up with MusicLM, which generates hi-fi music from text prompts, in May 2023. Meta followed with AudioCraft in August. Soon, Stability AI, which created the popular text-to-image model Stable Diffusion, swept the music industry with its Stable Audio. A text prompt like “a low-key romantic ballad in a Scandinavian setting, with harmonies across three octaves in the style of Charlie Puth” would generate exactly that, in a voice and style uncannily similar to the American singersongwriter. “This is the equivalent of Midjourney or Dall-E, but for music,” says Velardo.
In addition to Big Tech models, there is a proliferation of free, easy-to-access AI tools for music, especially voice-cloning applications. Sharma and Kalway were playing around with such tools when they decided to bring alive the sound of Rafi.
WHO OWNS MY VOICE?
The easy replication of famous voices with the use of AI has raised a significant question—who holds the
copyright
to a voice? Its particular timbre and texture? That is sending ripples across the music industry, leading to legal tangles and conversations about copyright.
When Universal Music Group, the world’s leading music company, got into a licensing dispute with shortform video company TikTok Inc earlier this year, AI-generated music was a big part of the quarrel. Universal said TikTok was “flooded with AIgenerated recordings”. It pulled down ghostwriter977’s “Heart on my sleeve”. Before that, Universal had sued AI company Anthropic for distributing copyrighted lyrics with its AI model Claude 2.
Singers, too, are raising their voices against the use of AI. Earlier this month, 200 artists, including Stevie Wonder, Robbie Williams, Billie Eilish and Katy Perry, wrote an open letter, asking AI developers, tech companies, platforms and digital music services to stop the usage of
AI in music
which, they said, “diminishes the rights of human artists”.
The ripples have reached India too. In January, SP Kalyan Charan, son of the legendary singer, S P Balasubrahmanyam, sued the producers and music director of a Telugu film called Keedaa Cola for the “unauthorised” use of his late father’s voice with the help of AI. The filmmakers have denied this. Singer-musician Shankar Mahadevan is cautious. “Use of technology is always a fine balance between possibilities and restrictions. AI in music is an amazing advancement in technology,” says Mahadevan, who is part of the Grammy-winning fusion band Shakti. “But it should be used to enhance a basic composition and not create or replicate human creations. Otherwise, it could be like copying someone’s tune. Is that ethical?” he asks.
The surge of AI has many ramifications. It could, for one, eat into the chances of a new singer. Today, new artists, looking for a break, render scratch versions of a song before the final version is sung by an established artist. It is these scratches that bring new artists to the notice of music directors. With
vocal cloning
, all that a music label needs to do is choose from a list of vocally filtered renditions of established singers to decide whose voice will suit the song. The trial-and-error of scratch versions, often the first step to fame for a new musician, could get completely bypassed.
“I think AI is a good tool in the hands of somebody who understands the organic creative process and the electronic creative process,” said tabla maestro Zakir Hussain and founder of Shakti in a recent interview to ET, adding, “In the hands of someone who is totally uninformed, I don’t know what it will become.”
AI can bring tremendous opportunities to the world of music. A recent report by EY said, in terms of revenue growth and cost benefits, generative AI would have an impact worth `45,000 crore in the media and entertainment business in India over the next few years. “It could mean a 30-40% enhancement of music industry’s revenues,” says Ashish Pherwani, media and entertainment leader, EY India.
“Now, we can keep alive yesteryear’s artists in the minds of their fans for longer. The cost of recreating a fan base vanishes because the fan of Hemant Kumar or Rafi will listen to the songs you create. It’s a dream-come-true from a business point of view,” he adds.
LEGAL VOID
There is a yawning gap, though. There is currently no law that protects artists, their voices, vocal styles and compositions from being recreated by AI-generated tools, says Velardo. “It’s a legislative void,” he says. He points to two problems: “One is straightforward: I’m recreating Taylor Swift’s voice. That’s a breach of copyright. There’s another that is more subtle, which is training full generative music systems. AI companies train their models on material they don’t own and they don’t have permission from copyright holders to do the training.”
The absence of laws is a problem that Charan’s lawyer Kavitha Deenadayalan is facing in the lawsuit against the makers of Keedaa Cola. “There is a narrow difference between using AI-generated music for the sake of entertainment or for paying tributes to a late singer, and using it for commercial purposes.
When it is commercialised, somebody has to get licence and consent and also pay the artist the remuneration that is mutually agreed upon,” she says. “In the absence of a law, there is an ethical need to reach out to artists or their family for permission. That’s what Rahman did for ‘Thimiri yezhuda,’” she adds. Gautam KM, partner at Krishnamurthy & Co and an expert in AI law, says, “When you are generating music in someone’s voice through a platform, where was the platform trained? Was it, in this instance, trained on the deceased singer SPB’s existing songs? If that is the case, has the platform owner taken necessary rights from his estate or heirs to train the platform with SPB’s voice? If you are giving lyrics to a platform and asking it to create a sound recording in the voice of SPB, you could very well be infringing upon the personality rights or the moral rights of the original singer,” he adds.
Legal guardrails are coming up. The state of Tennessee in the US has enacted a new law called the Ensuring Likeness, Voice and Image Security (Elvis) Act of 2024, which seeks to impose liability on AI and tech companies for unauthorised use of a person’s voice or likeness. The law will come into effect on July 1.
Meanwhile, artists are putting up their own guardrails against AI. Canadian singer Grimes has created an AI software called Elf.Tech, which allows users to clone her voice but they will have to share 50% of royalties with her. “The moment you commercialise a song with Grimes’ AI voice, you are going to do a revenue split,” says Velardo. She has also tied up with New York-based music distribution company TuneCore to distribute the songs. In a recent interview on The Music Podcast, singer Arijit Singh spoke about copyrighting his voice. Mahadevan echoes that view. “Every artist has to copyright his or her voice. I certainly would,” he says.

""The net
box-office collections
have dropped by 20% to ₹900 crore in Q1 2024 compared to the same quarter last year. The second quarter is also looking unimpressive, with no major releases planned for May. With setbacks in two back-to-back quarters, we have large recoveries to make in the last two quarters of 2024,"" says film business expert Girish Johar. In Q1, Fighter (Hindi) and Hanu-Man (Telugu) had the highest box office collections of ₹243 crore and ₹241 crore, respectively. Both Manjummel Boys (Malayalam) and Shaitaan (Hindi) had collections of ₹173 crore.
Guntur Kaaram (Tamil), Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (Hollywood), and Aadujeevitham-The Goat Life (Malayalam) collected ₹142 crore, ₹129 crore, and ₹102 crore, respectively. During the quarter, March saw the highest monthly box-office collections of ₹971 crore on the back of strong performances by Shaitaan, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and Aadujeevitham.
In January, the box-office collections stood at ₹934 crore, with Fighter, Hanu-Man, and Guntur Kaaram dominating the list. February saw a modest box-office collection of ₹685 crore with just two films, Manjummel Boys and Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, attaining receipts of over ₹100 crore.

OTTs may spend less on entertainment shows amid focus on margins,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/otts-may-spend-less-on-entertainment-shows-amid-focus-on-margins/articleshow/109382177.cms,18-04-2024,"Over-the-top (OTT) platforms are likely to ease spending on entertainment content due to hectic merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the media sector, impacting commissioning of fresh content amid stagnation in subscriber growth and a renewed focus on profitability after years of unbridled investment, say experts.
Experts believe that OTT entertainment content spending will continue to be driven by streaming giants
Netflix
and
Amazon Prime Video
as Indian media companies are either recalibrating their content strategy or going slow on greenlighting new shows due to M&A activities.
According to
Media Partners Asia
(
MPA
) research, online video contribution to total content investments including TV and films has nearly tripled since the pandemic with total video content investments touching $5.8 billion in 2023.
""We estimate a slight fall of 5% in 2024. Some of the key factors are the sluggishness in the SVOD (subscription video on demand) market, move towards profitability, and attempt at TV plus content cost models,"" said
Ashish Pherwani
, Media & Entertainment Leader, EY India.
According to the latest FICCI-EY report on the entertainment sector, online video content investment in 2023 stood at Rs 12,500 crore ($1.4 billion), with live sports comprising nearly 51% of the spending and the remaining 49% on originals and films.

ET Bureau
SonyLIV content head
Saugata Mukherjee
said there will be a correction on the number of Hindi originals produced by OTT platforms. ""There was a sudden glut of shows all across; I feel that will come down. And more of the same will no longer work,"" he added.
The
Sony Pictures Networks
India-owned streaming platform is scaling up original content offerings in non-Hindi languages such as Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi, and Bangla. ""We will also continue to expand our unscripted and premium television content pipeline,"" Mukherjee said.
The FICCI-EY report noted that 48% of all OTT titles produced were in Hindi, compared to 52% in other Indian languages. In 2023, streaming platforms produced a staggering 3,000 hours of original content.
“Given the flurry of M&A activities among major networks in the industry, the commissioning of new projects has taken a backseat over the last 4-6 months,"" noted MPA VP Mihir Shah.
The first half of 2024 will be dominated by live sports and elections, with entertainment likely to take a backseat.
""It will likely take some time for the entertainment industry to regain momentum, primarily hinging on the rebound of the advertising market and consumer sentiment in the second half of this year,"" Shah said, adding that streaming video is poised to match linear TV's content investments in the next five years.
Production companies anticipate a challenging year in 2024 due to a decrease in OTT content investment.
""In light of recent content experiments, it's no surprise to witness the anticipated consolidation across OTTs, a trend that transcends mergers alone. While pull content—defined by its creator, cast, and scale, garnering subscribers—remains steady, the landscape for push content—new, niche, and esoteric—is poised for significant reduction,"" said Friday Filmworks CEO Devendra Deshpande.
He emphasised that there is a need for precise content curation to adapt to changing audience preferences and industry demands.
Banijay Asia chief operating officer of Scripted Division Rajesh Chadha, however, believes that overall content spends might not go down even as OTT platforms rationalise costs.
""We are observing a trend of rationalisation in the market where there may be more shows per platform but with lower costs per unit for creators. While there might be fewer marquee shows each year, overall spending is expected to grow, albeit marginally,"" he said.
With Netflix and Prime Video unveiling their biggest-ever content slates for the Indian market, Nitin Menon, NV Capital Founder, feels that content spending by the streaming giants will not plateau any time soon.
""The fact that Netflix and Prime Video continue to add subscribers globally and their valuations continue to skyrocket makes it unlikely that they will reduce their OTT spends in India.""

ZEEL creates new organisational structure after senior-level exits,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zeel-creates-new-organisational-structure-after-senior-level-exits/articleshow/109375417.cms,17-04-2024,"Zee Entertainment
Enterprises Limited (
ZEEL
) has created a new organisational structure under which CEO Punit Goenka will assume direct charge of key business verticals, including the domestic broadcast business.
Amit Goenka, who has been spearheading the streaming business, will take direct charge of original content, including movies, besides assuming additional charge of the international broadcast business, enterprise technology, and broadcast operations & engineering. He will continue to report to Punit.
ZEEL, which has four key business segments, namely broadcast, digital, movies, and music, has also elevated key executives. The reorganisation is in line with the company's aim of achieving 18–20% EBITDA margin by FY26.
Ashish Sehgal will be responsible for integrated ad sales for the broadcast and digital businesses. In this enhanced role, he will also report to Amit for digital business revenue. He will continue to report to Punit for the broadcast business revenue.
Siju Prabhakaran, who leads the South cluster of channels, will take additional responsibility for the West cluster. Samrat Ghosh, the current head of the East cluster of channels, will take additional responsibility for the North and Premium clusters.
Live Events
Ruchir Tiwari will continue to lead the Hindi Movies cluster, while Vishnu Shankar will continue to lead Hindi GEC &TV and the FTA segment.
Following the exit of Zee Studios CEO Shariq Patel, Umesh Bansal will lead the movie business. Anurag Bedi will continue to lead the music business and enhance the vertical’s contribution to the company’s bottom line.
The reorganisation comes in the wake of the collapse of the merger deal with Sony Group Corp's India entities and the exit of senior executives like Rahul Johri (president-business), Punit Misra (president-content), and Nitin Mittal (president-technology).
The company has decided to lay off 15% of its more than 4,500 employees to reduce costs.
ZEEL Chairman R. Gopalan said the board has reviewed and approved the lean organisation structure proposed by Punit, which aims at streamlining the organisation and improving efficiencies across the business.
""The strong and capable set of leaders identified for each core business segment in the lateral structure is highly reflective of the company’s deep bench strength and ensures that the company remains well-positioned for the future,"" he added.
Punit said the new structure encompasses a more resilient team for the organisation to ensure agility and collaboration. ""Through this restructuring exercise, our aim has been to build an independent and enterprising team led by an experienced set of leaders to drive the company forward.""

Resolution professional (RP) Bhrugesh
Amin
has listed gaming machines, go-kart, bowling alleys and other entertainment devices spread across 13 centres as assets.
Amin did not reply to an email seeking comment.
SEPL, which has 480 employees, recorded revenue of Rs 118 crore in FY23.
This is the third resolution process for SEPL after the previous two rounds were scrapped due to litigation and other complications.
In a related development, previous promoter Shripal
Morakhia
has withdrawn his plea in the appellate tribunal challenging an order by NCLT’s Mumbai bench last November, annulling the change in ownership of the “SMAAASH” brand and terming it a “fraudulent” transaction by Morakhia. The court had said Morakhia colluded with associates to siphon off a “critical and valuable” asset of the debt-laden company through an assignment agreement signed in 2022 which substantially reduced the financial proposal offered by prospective bidders for the company.
The NCLT court had directed that the brand be transferred back to SEPL. A two-judge bench led by NCLAT chairperson Ashok Bhushan said in view of the appeal being withdrawn, the November 22 order of the NCLT continues to be operative.
""Now with Morakhia withdrawing the plea challenging the NCLT order altogether, a major impediment on the resolution is gone. But the previous promoter is notorious for creating legal hurdles. Though the resolution timeline does not end till August, creditors would like to expedite the process and find a buyer soonest,” said a second person aware of the process.
The court was deciding on a plea by
SEPL RP Amin
to disallow promoter Morakhia from transferring trademarks of
SMAASH
to privately-owned FGAPL after it was discovered that the brand was transferred through a backdated deed of assignment signed in 2019.

Moreover, with the withdrawal, it aims to evaluate strategic opportunities in order to generate higher value for all shareholders.
""We have reviewed the key steps taken by the management over the last few months that are result-oriented, and we believe that the Company is well poised to chart a stronger growth trajectory. Hence, after seeking an independent legal opinion, the Board has advised the management of the Company to withdraw the implementation application filed before the Hon’ble NCLT,"" said R.

On August 10, 2023, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT approved ZEEL's plan to merge with BEPL and Culver Max Entertainment, two Sony group companies. This merger could have resulted in the creation of a media company valued at USD 10 billion.
The merger was called off by Sony on January 22. Zee's inability to meet certain financial terms of the agreement and devise a strategy to rectify them contributed to the decision to make the change. In response to the accusations, Zed said that the Japanese company had acted in ""bad faith"" when it called off the merger.
The largest entertainment network in the nation would have been created if the Sony-Zee merger had gone through, owning over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV), and two movie studios (Zed Studios and Sony Pictures Films India).

“We look forward to building on our remarkable momentum in India with our new partner, Miraj Cinemas, as they expand The IMAX Experience in key locations and iconic venues across the country.”
“IMAX is the most immersive cinematic experience in the world, and we are thrilled to join forces with them to bring IMAX with Laser to our venues in India,” said Amit Sharma, Managing Director, Miraj Entertainment.
“At Miraj, we know our audiences want larger-than-life movie experiences, and we look forward to partnering with IMAX to bring The IMAX Experience to new locations in the country, including non-metro cities.”
This new agreement comes as IMAX continues to see strong momentum in India, which ranks among the top ten highest-grossing markets for the company. 2023 was IMAX’s highest-grossing year ever in the country, beating the previous record set in 2022.
Last year was also the highest-grossing year for Indian-language films for IMAX, delivering over $15.7 million across the company’s global network.
Moviegoers have shown an increasing appetite for IMAX in India—Oppenheimer and Avatar: The Way of Water are the first and second-highest grossing IMAX films in the region, and three recent Indian language films—K.G.F.: Chapter 2, Jawan, and Pathaan—are among the top ten highest grossing titles ever in the country.

Content behind blockbuster theatre footfall,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/content-behind-blockbuster-theatre-footfall/articleshow/109112623.cms,07-04-2024,"ET Intelligence Group
: At a time when upcoming elections and ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) dominate public discourse and mindshare, multiplexes have roped in banks to lure audiences to theatres. As many as 78 credit cards of various banks have rolled out attractive offers on movie tickets such as buy one get one (
BOGO
) free ticket, discount up to a certain ticket price, providing a fixed number of free tickets in a month, cash back on tickets, or pre-paid cards that offer tickets at cheap rates on weekdays.
So, are these offers boosting footfalls in theatres?
Sector experts are of the view that such strategies provide limited incremental benefits. Any significant improvement in footfalls and food and beverages (F&B) sales will depend on the popularity of the film, they said. ""Loyalty programmes can work for a certain section of audience and fill up shows on weekdays where occupancy rates are typically lower,"" said
Ashish Pherwani
, leader, media and entertainment sector, at EY. ""But the
content
must resonate with audiences. Only then will these initiatives provide incremental benefits.""
He said, ""BOGO free ticket offers help improve occupancy as well as increase food and beverage revenues. But it can be used only for certain films or time bands.""
Karan Taurani
, senior vice-president at
Elara Capital
, said BOGO offer is likely to contribute 12-13% to total revenues generated by
Hindi
films. ""But audiences avail these offers only if the content is good in theatres,"" he said.

""A few mid-budget films have worked in the March 2024 quarter. This is perhaps the first time when a few films have worked in a quarter and offers on tickets have added to footfalls,"" Taurani said.

A source privy to the development said the streaming platform is wooing SMBs who advertise heavily on Google and Meta platforms like YouTube and Instagram.
""Google and Meta have built massive digital advertising businesses thanks to SMBs. JioCinema is wooing these advertisers with live sports as a hook,"" an advertising expert said, adding that building long-tail advertisers will help reduce dependence on large advertisers.
According to a Ficci-EY media and entertainment report, digital advertising surged 15% to Rs 57,600 crore, including Rs 20,000 crore in ad spend by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in 2023.
JioCinema is allowing city-level targeting along with creative development and campaign management. It has created a self-serve platform for SMB advertisers to manage their ad campaigns.
A five-, 10- and 15-day base pack costs between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 3 lakh. The CPM rates range from Rs 35 to Rs 45. SMBs can advertise during the IPL playoffs and finals by spending Rs 7.5 lakh at Rs 55 CPM.
For advertising during the entire IPL season, SMBs will have to spend Rs 10 lakh, which works out to Rs 25 CPM with an estimated 40 million impressions.
Viacom18, which roped in 18 sponsors for IPL 2024, has kept its ad rates unchanged for the 2024 season.
It is seeking Rs 200 CPM for 10-second mid-roll and pre-roll mobile video ads, while FCT ad rates for live matches on mobile and connected TV are Rs 16 lakh and Rs 6.5 lakh, respectively.

Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
Most of us have heard this growing sentiment from a disgruntled uncle, perhaps even someone from a younger generation. And while you might dismiss them as simply being too rigid to adapt and appreciate the intricacies of modern
songwriting
and
music production
, we hate to break it to you: they might have actually been onto something.
To understand how
music
has developed over the years, researchers analysed over 12,000 English-language songs from 1980 to 2020. This included music from a wide variety of genres, including pop,
rap
, country, rock and R&B.
The study looked into what sort of emotions were being expressed in the songs, alongside the range of words used and how often they were being repeated. Almost unsurprisingly enough, the authors found that songs are becoming “simpler” — meaning that they were using easier words — and more repetitive over time.
While this simplification was prevalent across all genres, rap witnessed the greatest increase in the number of repeated
lyrics
. However, this conclusion seems almost obvious, considering that rap songs inherently sport a large array of lines to begin with.

Do we listen to music the way we used to?
Is this “oversimplification” necessarily a bad thing? That remains up for debate. While the ballads of
Bob Dylan
might have won the songwriter a Nobel Prize, helping the
artist
earn more popularity among the masses, that may not necessarily work in the current algorithm-driven music environment.
The way music is both produced and consumed have seen a gradual change over the past few decades. Studies have shown that an increasing amount of people play music in the background while they do something else. And if your music doesn’t strike a chord within the first 10-15 seconds, the harsh reality is that you’re probably going to get skipped. There’s no wonder progressive genres of music, which rely on slow and steady build up of musical pacing, have been on a popularity decline over the past few decades.
Further, the simple truth is that repeating sections generally help make the song catchier. And thus, the study found that songs with more choruses that repeated lyrics appeared to be more popular among the masses. Plus, this makes the song much easier to memorise and eventually transition itself into an earworm.
Music’s angsty years
The study also found that there has also been a noticeable shift in the tone and themes of popular music. Over the past 40 years, lyrics have taken a plunge from positive and joyful towards anger, disgust and sadness. Rap, in particular, has led the anger charge. Additionally, the prevalence of wording such as “me” or “mine” have become starkly more common in pop music, suggesting that musicians are putting out more self-reflective pieces.
These transformations can be attributed to various societal and cultural factors influencing both artists and audiences alike. Music has always been a reflection of the times, and artists are increasingly channeling their emotions into their music, resulting in a more aggressive and self-absorbed sound.
The findings of this research have been published in
Scientific Reports
and can be accessed

Taylor Swift
has been officially acknowledged as a billionaire, marking a historic milestone in the music industry. What distinguishes Swift's achievement is the fact that she attained this coveted status solely through her music career, making her the first artist to accomplish such a feat.
The renowned financial publication put an end to long-standing speculations about Swift's wealth by confirming that her fortune surpasses the billion-dollar mark, specifically resting at an impressive $1.1 billion. Unlike other industry titans like Rihanna and Jay-Z, whose wealth stems from diverse ventures ranging from fashion brands to entertainment holdings, Swift's riches are predominantly derived from her unparalleled success in the realm of music.
Forbes underscored Swift's extraordinary songwriting prowess and groundbreaking achievements, such as her record-breaking
Eras Tour
, which stands as the first billion-dollar tour in history. These monumental accomplishments have played a pivotal role in propelling her into the exclusive
billionaire club
, solidifying her status as a trailblazer in the music industry.
Swift’s ‘Swiftonomics’ Superpower
Swift's influence transcends beyond the confines of the music world, evident in her vast social media following and devoted fan base. Such is the magnitude of her impact that political commentators and conspiracy theorists alike have speculated about her potential sway over significant events, including the presidential election.
Remarkably, Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has not only shattered records, but also popularised the term ‘
Swiftonomics
’ — a phenomenon where her concerts stimulate substantial economic growth in the cities she performs in.

This economic impact extends far beyond ticket sales, as Swift's devoted fan base, known for their enthusiastic spending habits, contributes to increased retail sales, boosted tourism revenue, and overall economic vitality in the host cities. The term encapsulates the extraordinary influence of Swift's concerts on local economies, highlighting the profound economic ripple effect generated by her musical performances.
The latest evidence of this phenomenon was recently witnessed in Australia, where reports credited Swift's sold-out shows with a significant boost in retail turnover, as fans flocked to spend generously on clothing and accessories.
Taylor Swift's rise to billionaire status purely through her music, coupled with her propensity for breaking barriers and reshaping industry standards, cements her status as an iconic figure not just in the realm of music but also in the annals of economic accomplishment.

Delhi HC grants divorce to chef Kunal Kapur on ground of cruelty,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/kunal-kapur-masterchef-judge-granted-divorce-on-grounds-of-cruelty-by-his-wife-court-says-wife-lacked-respect-and-empathy/articleshow/108993420.cms,26-04-2024,"The Delhi High Court granted divorce to celebrity
chef Kunal Kapur
on Tuesday on the ground of cruelty meted out to him by his estranged wife, saying the woman's conduct towards him was devoid of dignity and empathy.
The high court allowed Kapur's appeal challenging a family court's order denying him divorce and said it is a settled position of law that making reckless, defamatory, humiliating and unsubstantiated allegations against a spouse in public amounts to cruelty.
""In the light of the aforenoted facts of the present case, we find that the conduct of the respondent (wife) towards the appellant (husband) has been such that it is devoid of dignity and empathy towards him.
""When such is the nature of one spouse towards the other, it brings disgrace to the very essence of marriage and there exists no possible reason as to why he should be compelled to live while enduring the agony of living together,"" a bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna said.
The estranged couple got married in April 2008 and a son was born to them in 2012.

In his plea, Kapur, who was a judge in television show ""Master Chef"", accused his wife of never respecting his parents and humiliating him.
On the other hand, the woman accused him of making false allegations to mislead the court and said she always tried to communicate with her husband like a loving spouse and was loyal towards him.
However, he kept her in the dark and concocted fabricated stories to obtain divorce, she had alleged.
The court said though discords are an inevitable part of every marriage, when such conflicts take the form of disrespect and inconsideration towards a spouse, the marriage itself loses its sanctity.
""It is relevant to mention here that within two years of marriage, the appellant has established himself as a celebrity chef, which is a reflection of his hard work and determination....
""Considering the aforesaid facts, it is only prudent to observe that these are mere allegations made by the respondent to disrepute the appellant in the eyes of the court and such unsubstantiated claims have the effect on one's reputation and therefore, amounts to cruelty,"" the bench said.

Crew
, featuring
Kareena Kapoor Khan
,
Kriti Sanon
and
Tabu
, has enjoyed a remarkable weekend journey. The heist comedy film, also starring
Diljit Dosanjh
and
Kapil Sharma
, is directed by Rajesh Krishnan and produced by Ekta Kapoor, Rhea Kapoor and Anil Kapoor.
As per industry tracker Sacnilk,
Crew
embarked on its box office flight with a solid collection of ₹9.25 crore on Friday, taking advantage of the Good Friday holiday. The momentum continued to climb on Saturday with a 5.41% increase, earning ₹9.75 crore.
Come Sunday,
Crew
soared past the double-digit mark and amassed a notable ₹10.25 crore, taking its domestic earnings up to ₹29.25 crore. Furthermore, it has grossed ₹62.53 crore globally in its opening weekend box office collections, the makers said on Monday.

Despite the bright start,
Crew
falls slightly behind Kareena Kapoor's previous chick flick
Veere Di Wedding
, which had garnered an impressive ₹10.7 crore on its opening day back in 2018.
Live Events
But with that said, these figures are noteworthy, particularly in the post-pandemic landscape, where female-led films have struggled to make a mark at the box office.
As per reports,
Crew
has hit the screens across 2000 theatres, premiering in over 75 countries and spanning more than 1100 locations worldwide. The estimated budget for the film, covering production and advertising expenses, is reportedly around ₹60 crore.
While
Crew
has experienced a successful flight so far, the true test lies ahead on Monday. The performance on this crucial day will determine its trajectory in the coming days, especially with ample time and space to dominate the box office.
Upon its release,
Crew
avoided direct turbulence with Hindi films, although it shared the spotlight with the Hollywood flick Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire and Prithviraj Sukumaran’s Aadujeevitham.
And with Eid approaching on April 10, new challengers will emerge in the form of Akshay Kumar's 'Bade Miyan Chote Miyan' and Ajay Devgn's 'Maidaan'. Until then, it will be interesting to see the heights Crew manages to reach by capitalising on its momentum.

Chinese C-drama gaining popularity on Indian OTT platforms,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/chinese-c-drama-gaining-popularity-on-indian-ott-platforms/articleshow/108911090.cms,31-03-2024,"Away from the public glare, Chinese TV dramas/ web series (
C-Drama
) are becoming popular in India and being made available through various OTT platforms like
MX Player
, Amazon Mini, YouTube, and several Indian regional OTTs.
The translated version of C-Dramas in various Indian regional languages has been gaining popularity among the younger audience since the Covid, ET has reliably learnt. It is often difficult for
Indian audiences
to distinguish and differentiate between Korean and C-Dramas due to language barriers, experts on the subject explained.
MX player is an Indian video streaming platform, which also has foreign TV content- Korean and
Chinese Dramas
in its “MX VDesi” section. Interestingly, most of the
YouTube channels
which stream C-Drama are located in western countries and the content/ script originated from China. C-Drama YouTube channels are predominantly operating from the United States, Taiwan and Hong Kong, ET has learnt.
C-Drama is receiving easy access to the Indian entertainment market with negligible regulation, experts alleged. This is in stark contrast to the Chinese policy of banning digital platforms like YouTube and restrictions on digital content from foreign countries. There is absence of reciprocity from the Chinese side for Indian content to Chinese viewers.
Chinese dramas are primarily produced for Chinese TV audience and are carefully reviewed by the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) of China, which is controlled by the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Chinese TV series are the outcome of complex cultural governance practices, which are influenced by diffuse political interests, commercial considerations, viewing habits, and ideological assumptions, according to experts on Chinese society.
In recent years, the
Chinese government
has vigorously supported the export of cultural projects. As the carrier of cultural output, television dramas carry important cultural messages.
C-Dramas could showcase Tibet as “Xizang” and depiction of India-China border in line with CCP official narratives, as well as Beijing’s activities in the ecologically fragile region as “development"" activities, and may create divided opinions among the residents of the Himalayan region.
India had more than 700 million active internet users in December 2022 and there were more than 450 million smartphone users and video viewing being the top online activities.
Indian OTT market
is to be around INR 30,000 crore by 2030, according to estimates.

Kill Joy: Licensing issues disrupt digital content consumption,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/kill-joy-licensing-issues-disrupt-digital-content-consumption/articleshow/108904985.cms,30-03-2024,"Paromita Deb Areng is frustrated with the
content consumption experience
on
digital platforms
. Recently, someone told her that the sound in one of her
Instagram
Reels was not working. Areng, a beauty products consultant from Pune, had used a trending audio clip from Instagram’s music library to enhance her video’s reach.
“Instagram offered to replace the now unavailable song on the app, but the new audio failed to update as well,” says the 43-yearold. Muting audio ended up silencing her voice in the video, thus impeding its reach. Areng says this problem isn’t unique; many creators are avoiding library audio for this reason.
Her frustration extends to
streaming services
. Unable to find older Korean dramas on
Netflix
, she subscribed to another streaming service, Viki, only to find those shows “unavailable in our region”. She was surprised to encounter geo-restrictions especially since the Korean government declared India the biggest market for Korean content last year.
Areng has since come to understand that these issues are due to complications in licensing agreements with content producers that grant platforms the right to publish content they do not own. However, that awareness doesn’t necessarily ease her exasperation.
""You feel short-changed because you are willing to pay to consume content legitimately and yet are being forced to look for alternatives that often expose your system to security risks.” She makes a valid argument. At least 46% users of virtual private network (VPN) globally opt for it to access streaming services, and 26% do it specifically to access region-locked entertainment, as per a report from Forbes Advisor published in August 2023.
Live Events
Eight years ago, when global streaming services like Netflix and
Prime Video
arrived in India, they promised access to a vast and continuously expanding content library. The “digital video-on-demand” branding created an unrealistic expectation that the content would be universally and permanently available. Over the years, snippets from popular international shows circulating on social media have only fuelled the craving for diverse content.
Ironically, this very desire has now shattered the illusion of seamless access as licensing-led curbs increasingly constrain users trying to watch anything and everything in the cloud. Similarly, music’s pivotal role in social media content has inadvertently exposed people to the vagaries of licensing disputes in the
music industry
, which end up restricting the use of songs on platforms like Spotify and Instagram.
OTT BORDERS
As a result, a growing number of users are expressing disgruntlement with their consumption experience. “It’s annoying that I can’t do a Prime Video Watch Party with my friends in India even when I’m in the country, just because I have a US-registered Prime account,” says Anmol M, a 27-year-old software engineer based in San Francisco.
In the US, he watches Koffee With Karan on Hulu because Hotstar isn’t available there. However, the show airs on Hulu a day later, he says, by which time his friends back home have already seen and made memes out of it. A decade ago, when Anmol moved overseas, there wasn’t a lot of content from India that he followed. “Very little existed in the first place,” he says. But now, he experiences FOMO for Indian content.
Some Indians abroad, like Soumya Wadhwa, compile a list of shows to watch during visits back to India due to this fear of missing out. “I like how western content is concentrated on certain platforms in India,” says the 32-year-old finance professional from Vancouver.
“Shows like Friends and Schitt’s Creek (a Canadian show) are available on Netflix India but not o n Netflix Canada,” she adds. During her last trip to India, she found Hindi-dubbed K-dramas on Netflix. She prefers the quality of Hindi dubbing over English, but Netflix Canada doesn’t have a Hindi audio option.
India doesn’t necessarily have easy access to every popular western title. Ask film critic Sucharita Tyagi, who moved from India to the US last year. When discussing a movie, show, or even an audiobook, she says, “I have to first ensure that it is available in India.” For instance, Oscar-nominated May December never hit Netflix India, despite its many trailers announcing Netflix as the film’s digital home in North America.
“I always check with my India team which Hulu titles are streaming on Hotstar,” says Tyagi. She recently discovered that the audiobook for Killers Of the Flower Moon—which inspired the 2023 Martin Scorsese movie—is strangely available in French, German and Italian on Audible India, but not in English.
Stranger still is the case of Mysteries and Feluda. It’s a locally produced animated series based on the tales of Feluda—a fictional detective conceived by writer-director Satyajit Ray– that is available on Prime Video but not accessible to Indian viewers. In an email response, a Prime Video spokesperson tells ET, “We make our locally licensed Indian films available in 240+ countries and territories.
While there could be some exceptions where certain rights/ territories could be carved out by the licensors in case of licensed content, it’s our constant endeavour to provide customers across locales, great content in their preferred languages.” Netflix and Disney+Hotstar declined to comment while ET’s emailed queries to Jio Cinema and Viki did not elicit a response.
IT’S BUSINESS
Why do platforms operate like this, you ask?
The short answer: It’s nothing personal, just business. “Around 80% of content rights, excluding those of major studios and their projects, are handled by sales agents,” says GK Tirunavukarasu, CEO of ProducerBazaar, a content IP rights exchange marketplace.
“Producers distribute their movies through these brokers, who then allocate different licences to several players in different territories for varying prices. It’s more beneficial for them to sell individual rights rather than in bulk.”
Dealing with content in both domestic and international markets involves at least 40 IP rights, including gaming rights, dialect rights, sequel rights, among others. “If the producer isn’t clued in to who is acquiring which rights where, it can lead to chaos [read: legal notices and lawsuits] due to the legalities of adhering to each contract,” adds Tirunavukarasu.
Entertainment lawyer Priyanka Khimani highlights how new services often are either clueless or feign ignorance about
content licensing
costs. She cites homegrown short video platforms from the post-TikTok ban era, some of whom neglected music licensing payments until labels took legal action.
In 2023, Spotify paid $9 billion to music labels and publishers in licensing fees, according to its annual report, “Loud&Clear”. Khimani, who specialises in media rights, says much of the behind-the-scenes efforts contributing to this figure often escape the general audience.
“Disputes between artists, labels and third parties cause delays in closing deals, which could potentially result in takedowns and song unavailability on platforms like Spotify and Instagram. Failure to arrive at a deal can result in catalogues being taken down from a platform, like it happened with Universal Music Group that has removed almost its entire catalogue from TikTok recently,” she adds.
An instance of content licensing issue that can escape the viewer is the use of third-party music in films and OTT shows. For instance, in Season 3 of an ALTT show, Dil Hi Toh Hai (2020), several Sony Music tracks that were featured prominently in some episodes initially, seem to have been replaced with instrumental music, even though the characters are still lipsyncing to songs like “Hawayein’’ and “Say Shava Shava”. This could have happened due to a gap in coverage of rights or changes to ownership of the music. Emails to ALTT, formerly ALT Balaji, and Sony Music did not elicit a response till press time.
Negotiations for music licensing occur across platforms and labels in various territories, with no standardised rates, relying solely on relationships and track record. “It’s truly the Wild West,” says Khimani.
Instagram has now started flagging audio affected by licensing changes. In an email, a Meta spokesperson tells ET, “We have deals across the music community in more than 150 countries.... However, our partnerships are always subject to change and our library of licensed music may shift as a result.”
Movies are shifting platforms, too. Streaming rights for new movies are typically for three-five years. So, crime thriller Andhadhun (2018) shifted from Netflix to Prime Video recently.
The 2016 Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal, which was on Netflix India initially, can now only be rented on Prime Video and Apple TV (or bought on the latter).
The latest content-licensing contracts are now allocating different language/ dubbed versions to different platforms. Hanu-Man, the Telugu blockbuster from January and one of the highest grossing movies of the year so far, has been released in Hindi on Jio Cinema while the original Telugu version has gone to ZEE5.
By April 5, its Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam dubbed versions will be on Disney+Hotstar. K Niranjan Reddy, producer of the film, says, “Each platform offers various subscription tiers in India and globally, potentially expanding our audience. It’s promising; we will see how the strategy unfolds. It’s a valuable learning experience for me.” Last week, Reddy closed a contract for the film’s Japanese dub with English subtitles through a local vendor in Japan, he tells ET from the US.
This constant movement of content across platforms renders Google searches for locating content unreliable and time-consuming, says Basreena Basheer, a product manager at a B2B media & security firm in Bengaluru. However, she defends platforms’ decisions to not disclose reasons for content unavailability: “Many avoid mentioning geo-restrictions to discourage VPN use, given the abundance of online guides on circumventing geo-blocking.” Reasons for unavailability typically tend to be vague to avoid direct mention of any regulatory role (if applicable) in geo-restriction, she adds.
Streaming platforms are increasingly focusing on expanding their original content library to avoid licensing hassles. However, licensed content remains vital for growth; 45% of Netflix watch-time in H1 2023 was dedicated to licensed content, per the company’s engagement report. Some players are trying to find ways to improve communication around licensing woes.
Viki has an option to petition to get a show in your region. Netflix has introduced the ‘Leaving Soon’ tag for short-lived titles. “Perhaps, an ‘Available from’ tag to provide a tentative timeframe for accessing content could help. I’d be thrilled if there are categories like ‘Available after general elections’, for instance,” says Basheer, only half-jokingly.

Zee slashes staff count at tech centre by half,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-slashes-staff-count-at-tech-centre-by-half/articleshow/108884379.cms,29-03-2024,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEE) has terminated 50% of its Technology & Innovation Centre (TIC) staff in
Bengaluru
to optimise costs and boost its operating margin, the company said in a statement.
ZEE
has also restructured the TIC and streamlined its scope of work following the board's guidance. The ZEE board had recently asked the management team to reduce TIC expenditure by 50% from ₹600 crore for FY25.
Under the new structure, the TIC plans to enhance its content creation, distribution, and monetisation processes by utilising technology-driven tools to gain deeper consumer preferences.
Speaking on this decision, Zee Entertainment CEO
Punit Goenka
said, ""We are laser-focused on creating exceptional content that is rich and engaging for our viewers.... To achieve this, we need a blend of a creative approach, detailed consumer insights, and futuristic technology solutions. The core and streamlined team at TIC will now only focus on enabling and empowering us in this process of content creation, distribution, and monetisation.""
In line with ZEE's goal of reaching 20% operating margin, the board had also asked the management to cut down losses from five verticals - Margo Networks (Sugarbox), Teleplay & Zindagi, Hipi, Weyyak, and English cluster of linear TV business.

Zee cuts staff by about half at Bengaluru's Technology & Innovation Centre to reduce costs,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-cuts-staff-by-about-half-at-bengalurus-technology-innovation-centre/articleshow/108882390.cms,29-03-2024,"Zee Entertainment
on Friday said that it has reduced the workforce at its Technology and Innovation Centre in
Bengaluru
by about half, after recommendations by a company-formed review panel to cut costs.
The decision was made by the managing director and chief executive officer Punit Goenka, the company said in a release.
The '3M (Monthly Management Mentorship) Program Special committee', comprising company chairman R. Gopalan and audit committee chairman Prakash Agarwal, had suggested that Zee should substantially reduce losses in its businesses, including its English-language TV channels, and cut costs in other areas to meet a key profit target, the company said on Tuesday.
The committee also recommended reducing expenses at Zee's technology and innovation center by half in fiscal 2025, compared to the previous year's 6 billion rupees ($72 million), the company stated.
Additionally, Zee is facing challenges from ongoing legal disputes related to unsuccessful deals with Sony and cricket, as well as heightened competition following the merger of Disney and Reliance's Indian media assets, forming an $8.5 billion media giant..

""We are confident that under his leadership, Cinépolis India will continue to thrive and innovate in delivering exceptional cinematic experiences to our audiences,"" he added.
In an earlier interview with ET, Sampat said that Cinepolis India will double its capex to Rs 280 crore in 2024 to add 80 screens a year in the country to achieve its eventual goal of having 1,000 screens in the country.
Cinepolis, which entered India in 2009, has 432 screens in the country and has been adding 40–50 screens per year. On average, the company spends Rs 3.5 crore on launching a new screen.
“Apart from the 432 screens that we have in the country, we have signed another 600 screens that will become operational at various stages,” Sampat said, noting that the cinema exhibition industry’s fate is very closely linked to the mall development activity in the country.
“For us, capex is not a constraint, but the infrastructure is. When we entered India in 2009, our original plan was to open 1,000 screens in 10 years,” he added. Sampat stated that the pace of mall development has been sluggish in the country.

"Zee working on risk mitigation, business continuity: R Gopalan, Chairman",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-working-on-risk-mitigation-business-continuity-r-gopalan-chairman/articleshow/108657387.cms,26-03-2024,"Zee Entertainment
Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) is implementing a risk mitigation and business continuity plan to ensure that the company's operations don't get impacted due to external factors, including an adverse Sebi order against the company's promoters, Chairman R. Gopalan told ET.
Responding to a question about the likelihood of an adverse Sebi ruling against ZEEL CEO
Punit Goenka
and whether the company has a succession plan in place to deal with this situation, Gopalan said that succession planning in a large company like ZEEL is a natural step in the functioning of the board, notwithstanding the external factors.
""ZEE is a very big organisation that is run by a set of experienced professionals, and it’s not run by promoters,"" said the 71-year-old bureaucrat turned corporate executive, who joined the company in August 2020.
He added that ZEEL has one of the best talent pools which is capable of achieving the goals set by the company. ""Ours is such a resilient organisation that a Sebi order against one key managerial personnel (KMP) can't disrupt the company,"" he noted.
Punit Goenka and his father, Subhash Chandra, chairman emeritus of ZEEL, are under investigation by the capital market watchdog for the alleged diversion of funds from ZEEL to promoter companies. The Sebi is expected to come out with its order sometime next month.

Last year, Goenka secured relief from the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) against Sebi's ban order barring him from holding the position of director or CEO of the company. Last month, Chandra also challenged Sebi's ban order before the SAT.
While stating that the board was concerned about Sebi's allegations against ZEEL promoters, Gopalan said that the current directors were not on the board as the fund diversion matter pertains to 2018-19.
He added that the Independent Investigation Committee (IIC) under former high court judge Satish Chandra will examine these issues and provide suggestions to the board.
""During our period, nothing has happened; everything was before us. Let the IIC come back with findings, and we will deal with them as we go along,"" Gopalan said, adding that the committee needs at least more than three months to study these and other critical issues.
Gopalan also said that the failed merger between Zee and Sony should have gone ahead despite differences between the two companies. He also stated that the company has requested the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to implement the merger scheme.
""We will continue to pursue the merger deal through NCLT. The merger deal should get implemented,"" he said while admitting that the litigation with Sony will prevent ZEEL from exploring other financial or strategic options.
""We have inquiries, but we cannot proceed until that (litigation with Sony) is resolved. We are eager to get the Sony merger deal implemented. As the situation develops, many alternatives and options can come up,"" he said.
On Disney Star's arbitration proceedings against the company for failing to adhere to the agreement related to the ICC TV deal, Gopalan said that the Walt Disney-owned didn't fulfill certain conditions like getting ICC approval. Moreover, he added that Disney Star started monetising the ICC rights on its TV channels.
Gopalan said that the board has asked the ZEEL management to advance the EBITDA target of 18-20% to FY25 against the guidance of FY26 given by the company.
The ZEEL chairman is also confident that the company will achieve revenue growth of 8-10% due to an increase in the market share of its TV channels and a rebound in the advertising market coupled with a hiking of TV channel bouquet rates by the company which will boost subscription revenues. ZEEL will also monetise its rich content library of lakhs of hours of original content.
""The Board is taking a hands-on approach to many things through the Monthly Management Mentoring exercise,"" he stated.

Prime Video and
MGM Studios
Head
Mike Hopkins
highlighted India as a crucial market for the
streaming
platform. He also highlighted the growing popularity of streaming among Indian audiences.
""As we look at the next 250 million subscribers that we're going to acquire, they are going to come from outside of the United States. And we're not going to be able to achieve that unless we do a really good job for customers in India as well,"" Hopkins said in a conversation with film producer

.
""India is a key geographic area for us. We also believe in the story of India and the
growth
that's been happening here over the last several years. When I think about streaming television and I think of India, what's remarkable is that I've heard many people say this week that more people are streaming TV and film than they're watching it on linear television on satellite cable,"" he added.
Hopkins also said that India is a hub for

In addition to having a priority spot to launch their engaging IPL opening day blitz, JioCinema Brand Spotlight will facilitate a first-of-its-kind marketer’s moment for the five brands, with the campaign makers and the brand custodians sharing exclusive insights and stories about how the campaign and brand film showcased on JioCinema Brand Spotlight were conceived and built.
These campaign stories will be available to viewers on an exclusive JioCinema brand spotlight rail on the JioCinema app.
Live Events
Brand Spotlight is one of a slew of innovations for advertisers around the upcoming IPL season. The packages and offerings have been specifically designed to help advertisers across the board, no matter what the objective, category, or scale of business. Each proposition from JioCinema has been carefully curated to enhance the brand’s proposition and increase the potential for scale and targeting possibilities they can extract digitally.
“The mood around the opening day of the TATA IPL has evolved over the years to become a moment where fans don’t just anticipate thrilling match action but also eagerly look forward to brands putting their best creative foot forward,” said Viacom18 Sports Head of Revenue, Anup Govindan.
“With digital, it is possible to harness this euphoria into an actionable moment for advertisers, and that is where Brand Spotlight comes to the fore. We are delighted to have Charged by Thums-Up, Parle Products, Britannia, Dalmia Cements, and PayZapp by HDFC Bank on board with us. The first five overs of the IPL 2024 are going to be historical with the spotlight on these brands, and we believe Brand Spotlight is going to be an anchor offering in the coming years.”
Speaking about partnering with JioCinema, Ravi Santhanam, Group Head, Chief Marketing Officer, and Head, Direct to Consumer Business, HDFC Bank, said, “Our PayZapp campaign for the TATA IPL is built on the idea that customers can pay anyone, anyhow, anywhere, and we felt this proposition synchronised almost perfectly with JioCinema's vision for digital, which is to make digital omnipresent. Introducing this communication right at the beginning of the season under Brand Spotlight is going to help us give it the platform it deserves by taking it far and wide in the country.”
Speaking about partnering with JioCinema, Amit Doshi, Chief Marketing Officer, Britannia, said, ""With Hungry for Gold, we aspire to instill pride in every Indian and inspire a nation hungry for victory in all arenas. By partnering with six remarkable athletes and integrating an engaging gaming promotion, we are not only showcasing their incredible journeys but also fostering a deeper appreciation for various sports. We are excited to partner with JioCinema for Brand Spotlight to make this message reach millions.”
On being part of the Brand Spotlight stable, Sameer Nagpal, COO, Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd, said, “We have tried to make our communication highly distinctive from the norms of the cement category. We have a differentiated consumer proposition and have presented it in a unique style using engaging visuals and music, along with one of the most unique stars of this generation, Ranveer Singh. We truly feel that JioCinema's Brand Spotlight will do justice to our creative efforts by giving our campaign the kind of reach and scale that only IPL on JioCinema can.”
Commenting on being a part of Brand Spotlight, Mayank Shah, VP, Parle Products, said, “The objective behind our IPL 2024 campaign is to further our cause started in 2017-18 of positioning ‘Parle’ from ‘House of Brands’ to a ‘Branded House’ while building an emotional connection with consumers. Our TVC is packaged to deliver the message with classic elements of wit and humour, but it underscores the core thought of positioning Parle as a top corporate brand. We took that finished product to JioCinema's Brand Spotlight, as in addition to giving us unprecedented reach and customisation options, the Brand Spotlight rail on the app is a great platform to take viewers behind the scenes to talk them through this campaign in a never-been-done-before manner.”
Fans will be able to catch the latest season of the IPL for free in 4K across 12 languages, introducing Haryanvi for the first time, multi-camera options including the much-hyped Hero Cam, and many more fan-engagement features, including Jeeto Dhan Dhana Dhan.

"Not theatrics, meaningful content to drive fortunes of film industry",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/not-theatrics-meaningful-content-to-drive-fortunes-of-film-industry/articleshow/108569353.cms,18-03-2024,"In the years since the Covid-19 pandemic shifting audience tastes have given rise to two divergent trends in
India
's exhibition
industry
.
According to the latest Ficci-EY media and entertainment report, footfalls in
theatres
(single screens and multiplexes) have fallen by 9% to 900 million in 2023 from 994 million in 2022. But, gross
box-office collections
(before tax) of single screens and multiplexes expanded 15.3% and 13.7%, respectively.
To be sure, the base effect plays a role in the quantum of increase.
Still, growth in gross box-office collections of single screens has been higher than for multiplexes. These divergences help explain how
audiences
are watching content in theatres after the pandemic.

More than two years since the re-opening of theatres after the pandemic, footfalls have not touched pre-pandemic levels. In 2019, they were 1.46 billion, sliding to 900 million last year. The cost of going to a movie (not just ticket price) outweighs the cost of buying relatively economical entertainment: streaming and social media platforms. Also, audiences are willing to wait for films to release on streamers (high viewership of
Hindi
film Animal on Netflix is a case in point) after the theatrical release.
This fall in footfalls is compensated by high-ticket prices, which audiences are willing to pay if rewarded either with well-made, big-budget massy films or mid-budget films. Today, with the exception of Hollywood tent-pole movies, the content that works in multiplexes (12th Fail, for instance) is not materially different from what works in single screens.
Indeed, a Hindi filmgoer has become more accepting of non-Hindi content, provided it is engaging and entertaining. This is reflected in the box-office collections of southern films. According to the Ficci-EY report, the gross box-office collections of southern films in 2023 were ₹5,200 crore. For
Hindi films
, by contrast, the collections totaled ₹5,300 crore. The space for meaningful content, which was considered exclusive fiefdom of multiplexes, has been taken over by
streaming platforms
(especially YouTube).
Hence, going to theatres is no longer a weekend tradition or ritual followed without careful assessment of its effectiveness in delivering worthy entertainment. As loyalties among audiences shift more toward engaging and entertaining content or stories than stardom of stars, the decision to watch films in theatres is formed after considering three things.
One is either watching trailers of films. Two: Following films' reviews of trustworthy people. And three: How competing available sources of entertainment - streamers and social media - would fare against a theatrical experience.
So, when entertaining massy films were released in 2023, single screens, which were shut for a while due to the pandemic, saw higher collections in 2023 compared with the previous couple of years.

In August 2023, the company said it plans to introduce 600 new casual and hyper-casual games across 15 categories on the platform as well as support the esports ecosystem with live tournaments.
Glance is a pre-installed, customisable lock screen available in Android devices which delivers personalised content such as news, entertainment, sports, fashion and games. The Glance screen can also be disabled if users choose to opt-out from the platform. Only 10% content on Glance is promotional or advertising while the rest is pure content curation, the executives said.
Besides the adtech business the company is also bullish on the
consent management
space as the Digital Data Protection Act was enforced in India, CBO, Agarwal said.
InMobi, last year, acquired the US-based consent management platform Quantcast Choice which enables organisations to comply with global privacy regulations. The executives declined to comment on Quantcast's India plans.
CMO Chowdhury said that generative artificial intelligence is helping the company create more engaging content, do accurate language translations and curate content faster.
On Thursday, Glance released its 2024 trends report, according to which, last year, the G20 World Cup and Chandrayaan were among the trending topics with over 4 billion and 2 billion glances (views), respectively. Reality TV show Bigg Boss Season 17 updates also generated 6 billion glances throughout the season, it said.
As per its latest financials, InMobi’s revenue for year-ending March 2023 stood at Rs 589.57 crore, up 41% from Rs 415.93 crore in previous year. Its profit after tax was Rs 113.2 crore for FY23, up from Rs 24.5 crore in FY22.

Tata Group considering buying Disney’s stake in Tata Play,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tata-group-considering-buying-disneys-stake-in-tata-play/articleshow/108498108.cms,14-03-2024,"Tata Group
is considering buying Walt Disney Co.’s stake in
Tata Play
Ltd. to give it full control of the subscription television broadcaster, people familiar with the matter said, continuing a shakeup in India’s media industry.
The companies are in preliminary talks about an acquisition of Disney’s significant minority stake, which would value Tata Play at about $1 billion or more, the people said, asking not to be identified as the considerations are private. Tata may decide not to pursue a deal, they said.
Representatives for Tata and Disney declined to comment.
The buyback discussions with Disney come after the American company signed a binding agreement in late February to merge its India unit with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s media arm Viacom 18 Media Pvt., creating an $8.5 billion entertainment giant that will have 750 million viewers and dominate the sector in the world’s most-populous country.
The mega merger is also triggering an exit by another media behemoth as minority partners cash out. Paramount Global on Thursday agreed to sell its 13% stake in its Indian TV business to its partner, Ambani’s
Reliance Industries Ltd.
, for $517 million.

Buoyed by positive reviews, its collections surged, with the film earning ₹18.75 crore on the second day and a record-breaking ₹20.5 crore on the third day, marking the highest single-day collection for the film.
This week, 'Shaitaan' pocketed ₹6.25 crore on Wednesday, echoing Tuesday’s earnings of ₹6.5 crore but falling behind the ₹7 crore net recorded on Monday. Consequently, the film's cumulative domestic collection has soared to ₹74 crore at the Indian box office alone.
Live Events
On Wednesday, the supernatural film reported an overall Hindi occupancy rate of 13.08%, with night shows witnessing the highest occupancy at 18.91%. Notably, Chennai recorded the highest occupancy, trailed by cities like Jaipur and Pune.
100 and not out
With this stellar performance, 'Shaitaan' has reportedly crossed ₹100 crore mark worldwide. This is Ajay Devgn's third consecutive film to hit the century mark, after Drishyam 2 and Bholaa.
'Shaitaan' has also clinched the third spot among the highest-grossing films of 2024 while continuing to generate box office revenue at an impressive run rate. It now trails behind only 'Fighter' starring Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone, and 'Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya' featuring Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon.
Expectations are rife for further growth in the film's numbers in the days ahead, setting the stage for significant milestones in the international market. However, looming competition awaits as Sidharth Malhotra and Disha Patani’s movie 'Yodha' is slated to hit theatres starting March 15.

Pending poll umpire's decision delays closure of IPL ad deals,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pending-poll-umpires-decision-delays-closure-of-ipl-ad-deals/articleshow/108473609.cms,14-03-2024,"Advertising deals for this year's Indian Premier League (IPL) are taking longer to close due to a lack of clarity over its schedule because of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, industry officials told ET. ""Lack of clarity over the IPL schedule due to the clash with Lok Sabha elections has meant that a lot of clients are in a wait-and-watch mode before proceeding with ad deals,"" a senior official aware of the development said.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (
BCCI
) has announced the schedule for the first 21 matches of the upcoming IPL between March 22 and April 7. It is waiting for the Election Commission to announce the schedule for the
Lok Sabha polls
, slated to be held in April and May, before scheduling the rest of the tournament. Industry insiders said companies looking at campaign-based advertising would want more visibility on the schedule.
IPL official broadcaster
Disney Star
and official streamer
Viacom18
have managed to close a slew of sponsorship and spot-buy deals and are expected to sign more deals in the run-up to the IPL, which will kick off on March 22. ""The IPL on-ground sponsorships were also closed very late, with some sponsorship slots remaining unsold even now,"" said the official cited above. ""Both Disney Star and Viacom 18 have to offer the first right of refusal to IPL's on-ground sponsors.""
Disney Star is believed to have inked ad deals with
Asian Paints
, Vimal Pan Masala, Dream11, My11Circle,
Hindustan Unilever
, HDFC, Reckitt Benckiser,
Indigo Paints
, and
Nerolac Paints
.
Viacom18 is understood to have closed deals with Dream11, My11Circle, HDFC, Google, Parle Products, Coca-Cola, Dalmia Cement, and Naukri.com. It is also looking to close deals with brands from categories like online stock trading, handsets, four-wheelers, and tyres.

Parle Products vice-president Mayank Shah said the biscuits and confectionery company has decided to advertise on JioCinema this year since digital advertising is cost effective and allows for better targeting. ""We advertised on TV last IPL, but this year we have decided to partner with JioCinema,"" he said. The overall ad spending on IPL last year across TV and digital had nosedived to roughly ₹4,000 crore from close to ₹5,000 crore during IPL 2022, mainly due to the exit of many new-age advertisers amid a funding crunch. Media buyers assert that the overall ad spend will grow this year.
Shashi Sinha, chief executive of IPG Mediabrands, said the sentiments among advertisers for the IPL are much better compared to the previous edition. ""The overall ad spend on the IPL should go up this year,"" he said.
Ashwin Padmanabhan, president, investments, trading and partnerships, at GroupM India, said the market is looking buoyant and there is a lot more clarity since both Disney and Viacom18 started selling ad inventory very early.
""This year, we will have a lot more advertisers who will advertise on IPL,"" he said. ""IPL advertising is getting democratised since entry costs have come down. The growth in viewership last year will help both Disney Star and Viacom18.""

Audio streaming platforms bet on subscriptions model for growth,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/audio-streaming-platforms-bet-on-subscriptions-model-for-growth/articleshow/108473063.cms,14-03-2024,"Audio streaming platforms
are betting on the
subscription model
to fuel the next phase of
growth
, having successfully built a strong trend among listeners to stream music content over the last few years, industry executives told ET.
Music labels like
Saregama
, the biggest suppliers of content to audio OTTs, are also lending a helping hand to let audio streaming platforms pivot to subscriptions after years of relying on the
ad-supported model
.
According to a FICCI-EY report, the domestic OTT audio market will grow from 7-8 million paid
music streaming
subscribers to
15 million
by 2026 if prices remain unchanged and the industry aligns on
incentivising users
to pay.
Spotify MD - India Amarjit Batra said the platform has come up with convenient subscription plans catering to different target audiences. He added that the platform has also ensured that users can pay for its ‘Premium’ tier service by using convenient methods such as UPI.
""In India, we spent the first five years on habit-building for music streaming and focused deeply on growing our users to a significant size. In parallel, we have made ‘Premium’ more accessible and relevant in India through our subscription plans that range from a day to a year, and from student plan to family plan,"" he said.

Batra said Spotify has both an ad-supported free tier and a ‘Premium’ tier service to serve varied listener types. ""We are in 180+ markets globally, and in more mature markets, the skew toward ‘Premium’ is higher, while in several emerging markets, the free tier is more popular,"" he said.
During the company's Q3 earnings call, Saregama India MD Vikram Mehra said many audio OTT platforms have decided to move from free to paid subscription model due to financial pressure. He added that music labels including Saregama have joined hands to help platforms in this transition.
""We have removed our conditions on minimum guarantees for platforms that have moved behind a paywall. It will make the overall music economy far healthier. But there are short-term pains because of that,"" Mehra said.
He also noted that Saregama's revenue from OTT audio platforms has come under pressure due to the shift to the paid model and the minimum guarantees going away. ""We have been able to balance it to some extent by higher numbers in the other verticals but overall, there is pressure on the music side,"" he said during the call.
EY India Media & Entertainment Leader Ashish Pherwani noted that the ad monetisation model has faced profitability challenges across all media, news, sports, entertainment, and music due to high content costs.
""Moving to a paid model can cause short-term stress, but will be critical for growth in the long run,"" he added.

"UP govt subsidy is a blessing for filmmakers, Director Sarika Sanjot",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/up-govt-subsidy-is-a-blessing-for-filmmakers-director-sarika-sanjot/articleshow/108440535.cms,12-03-2024,"Bollywood director Sarika Sanjot, known for her debut film shot in
Varanasi
, has once again set her sights on Uttar Pradesh for her next cinematic ventures. Sarika revealed that she has finalized scripts for two films. Hailing from Ghaziabad, Sanjot expressed her familiarity with the region, stating, “I am from
Ghaziabad
so I know this belt very well. My debut feature film Kahani Rubberband Ki, with Avika Gor, Pratik Gandhi, and Manish Raisinghan, was shot in Varanasi, which released in theatres a month back. Now, I have two projects ready to roll — social-drama Mardo Ke Liye Nished Hain (MKLNH) that I have written, and suspense-thriller Sanniveshanam penned by Baahubali and Bajrangi Bhaijaan writer (KV Vijayendra) Prasad sir.”
The filmmaker has earmarked the shooting locations for her upcoming projects. “MKLNH will be shot in Lucknow. I came down just two weeks back and have captured a lot of locations on my camera. The other film will be shot in Kanpur. We have already pitched the films to the actors and once their dates are locked, we can start either of them,” Sarika disclosed.
Sarika attributed her decision to shoot in Uttar Pradesh to the compelling subjects of her films. “Initially I wanted to shoot my debut in Maheshwar but once I came to Varanasi, I immediately realized that it has to be shot here. The soul of my upcoming films too is here — in this belt. The icing on the cake is the subsidy given by the UP government. I shot my debut film after getting it approved by Film Bandhu, as per their norms and have already applied for a subsidy. For filmmakers like us, who come from a non-film background, it’s a blessing.”

According to BookMyShow’s recently released ‘The CineFiles’ consumer survey report, the incorporation of cutting-edge technologies and immersive cinematic experiences has further heightened the magic of the big screen. Advanced sound systems, state-of-the-art visual effects, and larger-than-life screens continue to transport audiences into captivating worlds.
This has further translated into the survey, with 74% of respondents opting to watch a movie in the theatre for the immersive larger screen and high audio quality experience. 40% of respondents almost always opt for premium screens, showing a significant rise in audience interest for the premium movie-watching experience.
2023 was the highest-grossing year ever for IMAX at the Indian box office and the Company delivered over $1 billion at the global box office for only the third time in its history. Local Indian content performed extremely well, with releases like Jawan and Pathaan helping topple previous box office records set in 2022.
In 2024, Imax will continue to debut more awe-inspiring Hollywood blockbusters and local releases in India, including the highly anticipated film Dune: Part Two, which released in Imax locations across the country on March 1.

RIL
’s
Viacom18
and Walt
Disney
’s Star India is set to redefine media, entertainment and sports in India. With over 750 million viewers, 200,000-plus hours of content and all the key cricket properties under its belt, the new entity could very well change the rules of the game even globally. Javed Farooqui & Vinod Mahanta take a look at the reasons behind the merger, the opportunity at hand and the key players who could make it all happen.
Nita Ambani
, Chairperson, Viacom18-Disney: Nita Ambani’s foray into the world of entertainment biz
In a video played at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s pre-wedding bash in Jamnagar last week, Reliance head honcho Mukesh Ambani, portraying Amitabh Bachchan’s iconic character in the 1978 hit Don, delivers a popular dialogue in a filmi way—“Hamari zindagi mein asli don ek hi thi, ek hi hain aur ek hi rahegi” — and walks away from the throne. Nita Ambani coolly takes over the throne, dons the black shades and effortlessly embodies the look of a boss. Well, the boss is now going to take over a new throne — at Star India-Viacom merged entity. Months after relinquishing her position on the board of Reliance Industries (RIL), Nita Ambani has taken on her first business role as the chairperson of the proposed Star IndiaViacom18 merged entity.
This transition not only marks her direct plunge into a sector close to the heart of her husband, but also underscores the Ambani dynasty’s continued focus on the media domain, exemplified by an investment of Rs 22,000 crore in Viacom18 and the imminent creation of the Star-Viacom18 behemoth in record time.
While Nita Ambani has been associated with sports, steering the ship for ventures like the IPL franchise Mumbai Indians and spearheading grassroots sports development through the Reliance Foundation (RF), her coronation as chairperson of the StarViacom18 juggernaut marks her grand debut into the glitzy world of media. She enters the arena as a formidable contender, poised to clash swords with Sony, Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video.

Her ascension signals a significant change as she takes the reins of what promises to be India’s biggest media empire.
This comes after her appointment as the first Indian woman on the board of the International Olympic Committee. She has also been on the East India Hotels board for over a decade. In August 2023, she stepped down from RIL’s board to focus on RF.
Given the vast footprint of her media empire and her competitive nature, Nita Ambani’s mantra will surely be, “Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkin hai.”
Into the future: Disney’s case for merger with Viacom 18
When Disney completed the buyout of Star India in 2019, the asset held a lot of promise for the global media conglomerate thanks to strong television and digital assets.
Cut to 2022, a series of miscalculations happened starting with the $3 billion acquisition of IPL TV rights and the loss of IPL digital rights to competitor Viacom18 plus the ill-fated acquisition of the ICC media rights for $3 billion. It all contributed to the decline in valuation of India’s once most valuable media asset.
Star India, which once commanded over $15 billion in valuation, has seen its valuation plummet to over $3 billion due to the decline in subscriber base of Disney+ Hotstar due to IPL digital rights losses and the mounting losses from sports due to costly sports rights renewals.
The issues in India and the challenges in the US had led Disney, under Bob Iger, to reconsider the future of Star. The company opted for a joint venture with Reliance to mitigate losses in the Indian market, even at the cost of a decline in valuation.
Growing investor activism in the US after the share prices hit a nine-year low in August last year due to losses from the streaming business and declining profits from the TV business also forced Disney to hand over the reins of its India business to the country’s richest man.
It’s all about scale: Why Reliance found the perfect match in Disney
Mukesh Ambani's love for scale and size is no secret. The chairman of retail-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries had always aspired to build India’s largest media empire after taking control of Network18 from its erstwhile promoter, Raghav Bahl, in 2014.
Viacom18 became part of the Reliance empire after the Network18 acquisition. Reliance took a controlling stake in Viacom18 after buying out an additional 1% stake from Paramount Global (earlier Viacom) in 2018.
Reliance has always been concerned about Viacom18’s smaller size compared to Star, Zee, and Sony. Its quest for inorganic expansion first took it to Sony Pictures Entertainment’s India unit. However, the proposed merger was called off by Reliance due to differences over shareholding and valuation in 2020.
Following the collapse of the deal with Sony, Reliance toyed with the idea of merging Viacom18 with Zee. The deal had the blessings of Zee’s then-largest shareholder, Invesco, which was looking to recast the Zee board and oust Punit Goenka as CEO. Zee promoters rejected Reliance’s offer and instead opted for a deal with Sony, which also eventually failed after two years in January 2024.
After failing to conclude a deal with the second and third largest players, the Mukesh Ambanibacked company struck gold in its third attempt with the acquisition of market leader Star India, a treasured asset in India’s media industry. The Star-Viacom18 merger deal signed on February 28 will create an $8.5 billion media goliath with a dominating presence in both TV and digital segments.
The sweetener in the deal for Reliance is the $3 billion valuation at which Disney decided to merge Star India with Viacom18.
Uday Shankar
, Vice Chairperson, Viacom18-Disney: The man who gets bored when there is no big challenge
Months before Disney mega deal with Reliance Uday Shankar sat down for a chat with ET, and he had this to say about himself: “Meri story ki headline har din alag honi chahiye (Everyday there should be a new headline for my story).”
Providence has granted his wish many, many times over. The latest headline has him as vice-chairperson of India’s largest entertainment behemoth.
Ever since he left Disney-Star India in 2020, Shankar had shifted focus to his new obsession — digital. So much so that he even took out the TV in his room.
While digital will continue to be at the forefront of the merged entity’s agenda, he might have to get the TV back soon considering that the new entity runs over 100-plus TV channels.
As he provides strategic guidance to the Star-Viacom18 combine, Shankar’s biggest challenge will be to turn around the streaming and sports businesses considering the pay-TV business is in a chronic decline.
But that tells something about the journalist-turned-CEO-turned-investor-turned-vice chairperson. “My default mode is challenger,” Shankar told ET. “I get bored when there is no big challenge.”
Shankar grabbed global attention in 2017 with a stratospheric bet of Rs 16,348 crore for the IPL media rights for five years. And in another déjà vu moment, Shankar, this time for Mukesh Ambani’s Viacom18, bagged the digital rights of IPL for the Indian subcontinent for a very substantial Rs 23,758 crore. That was in 2022.
What has helped Shankar take bold bets has been his knack for cultivating successful partnerships with powerful promoters. Just like his current partnership with RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani. Before that, Shankar was firmly backed by Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan while he built Star India into a media leader.
He started his career as a political reporter at The Times of India in the 1990s and went on to helm the newsroom at AajTak before captaining one of India’s most influential media enterprises Star India. In his decades in the media, Shankar has also been at the forefront of industry-related issues whether it was the implementation of cable TV digitisation, the creation of the Broadcast Audience Research Council or even teaming up with rivals to fight subscriber under-reporting by cable TV operators.
“I closely interacted with him when I was secretary of information and broadcasting during 2015-16,” said former bureaucrat and ex-chief election commissioner Sunil Arora. “In his capacity as president of FICCI’s Media and Entertainment Committee, he played a crucial role between the media and the establishment by offering constructive, frank, and useful inputs that had a broad bandwidth.” Key to Shankar’s success has been the ability to forge high-quality teams. At Star, this involved professionals from diverse backgrounds who have gone on to solid careers: Sanjay Gupta, who is now the India head of Google; Ajit Mohan, who heads Snap’s APAC operations; Nitin Kukreja, who is the CEO of Allen Career Institute; and Amit Chopra, currently with Samara Capital, among others.
“I don’t look at CVs; I like people with one breakout achievement,” he told ET.
After exiting Disney, Shankar wanted to dabble in healthcare and education. Looks like those sectors will have to wait.

JV deal with Reliance Industries will help Disney derisk in India: Bob Iger,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jv-deal-with-reliance-industries-will-help-disney-derisk-in-india-bob-iger/articleshow/108333233.cms,08-03-2024,"Walt Disney
CEO
Bob Iger
believes the joint venture with
Mukesh Ambani
's
Reliance Industries
Limited (
RIL
) will enhance the company's bottom line and reduce risk in the Indian market.
Iger also said that the JV deal will allow Disney to own a significant stake in a larger media entity and also maintain a presence in the Indian market.
Mounting losses from the Indian sports business and the decline in Disney+ Hotstar's subscribers due to the loss of the Indian Premier League (IPL) digital rights had compelled Disney to consider strategic options for its India business.
RIL's
Viacom18
will merge into Disney's
Star India
to create an $8.5 billion media entity. Viacom18 is valued at $4 billion, while Star India is valued between $3-3.5 billion.
In 2019, Disney acquired Star India for over $15 billion as part of its 21st Century Fox acquisition. Star India, which has been rebranded as Disney Star since, is India's largest media entity with dominant market shares in both TV and digital.

The Star-Viacom18 merger is set to become India's largest media entity, with a topline of approximately Rs 25,000 crore.
""We wanted to stay in India. We made a big investment in India when we purchased the assets of 21st Century Fox. We're one of the biggest media companies in India. But even though it's the most populous country in the world, and we felt we want to be there because of that, we also know that there are challenges in that market,"" Iger said while speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on March 5.
""And we had an opportunity to align with Reliance, which is the company that has done very well there and one that we respect. And in doing so, we end up owning part of a bigger media company. And we believe that it should not only benefit us in terms of the bottom line but also derisk us there,"" he added.
Iger also termed the Star India-Viacom18 JV deal the best of both worlds because Disney has a great partner in RIL, which is India's largest telecom company with significant assets in the media sector.
""So, it's kind of the best of both worlds. We stay in the market at a significant level. We have a very good partner in Reliance, and we get to have a chance of growing a business and lowering the risk of doing so,"" Iger noted.
On February 28, RIL, Viacom18, and Walt Disney said that they had signed definitive agreements to form a JV by merging Viacom18's media operations into Star India through a court-approved scheme of arrangement. The Mukesh Ambani-led RIL has committed to investing Rs 11,500 crore ($1.4 billion) in the JV.
RIL, Viacom18, and Disney will own 16.34%, 46.82%, and 36.84% of the JV, respectively. RIL will control the JV as it also owns a majority stake in Viacom18. Bodhi Tree Systems, which is promoted by Uday Shankar and James Murdoch, also owns a roughly 16% stake in Viacom18.
The JV will comprise TV and streaming video platforms across entertainment and sports, including JioCinema and Hotstar, which have over 750 million viewers in India and the global diaspora.
Nita Ambani will serve as the chairperson of the JV, while Shankar will provide strategic guidance as its vice chairperson.

Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan launches India's first state-owned OTT platform,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-launches-indias-first-state-owned-ott-platform/articleshow/108299106.cms,07-03-2024,"Kerala
on Thursday launched India's first
government-owned OTT platform
'CSpace' with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan terming it as a decisive step in the onward journey of
Malayalam Cinema
. Inaugurating
CSpace
, managed by the
Kerala State Film Development Corporation
(KSFDC), at a function at Kairali Theatre here, the chief minister said this is a pioneering initiative that gives prominence to films with
artistic and cultural value
without hurting the
mainstream film industry
.
Noting that earning profit is the prime motive of the
private-sector OTT platforms
that mostly go for commercial movies, CSpace is set to make a mark as a medium that brings home quality films, he said.
""Private OTT platforms give prominence to films in the most widely spoken language since their prime motive is to maximise profit. The priority of CSpace, on the other hand, is to onboard and stream contents with artistic and cultural values. This will also help the promotion of the Malayalam language and culture,"" Vijayan said.
The launch of CSpace also signifies leveraging of the cutting-edge technologies which will define Malayalam Cinema in the future, he said.
The decision that CSpace will only stream films that are already released in theatres signifies that this is not a move that will harm the interests of the film industry. Its aim is to promote good cinema without hurting the interests of the producers and exhibitors, the chief minister said.
Live Events
Presiding over the function, Culture Minister Saji Cherian said the launch of CSpace aligned well with the government's policy of supporting art and artists representing diverse traditions, he said.
The films that win state, national and international awards will be streamed on the platform, he said.
General Education Minister V Sivankutty, Food and Civil Supplies Minister G R Anil, Antony Raju, MLA, and Mayor Arya Rajendran were also present at the function.
KSFDC Chairman and eminent director Shaji N Karun said CSpace is a novel initiative that seeks to help producers to get back their investment through crowd-funding route.
Total transparency in profit it earns and the number of viewers it attracts are the distinguishing features of the platform, he said.
KSFDC is a state-owned company entrusted with the promotion of Malayalam Cinema and industry, under the Department of Cultural Affairs, Government of Kerala.
For selection of the content, KSFDC has constituted a 60-member curator panel including eminent cultural personalities like Benyamin, OV Usha, Santhosh Sivan, Shyamaprasad, Sunny Joseph, and Jeo Baby.
Every content that is submitted will be evaluated by the curators considering its artistic, cultural and infotainment merit, before showcasing it on the platform.
A total of 42 films have been selected in the first phase for streaming on CSpace, including 35 feature films, six documentaries, and one short film. Films that have won national or state awards and those exhibited at major film festivals will also be streamed.
Another distinctive feature of CSpace is transparency in its operations and the overall earnings and the revenue share.
The platform, which operates on a pay per view basis, allows viewers to watch a feature film for Rs 75 and shorter contents for a much lesser price. Exactly half of the amount charged goes to the content provider.
Viewers can download the CSpace app from the PlayStore and the App Store from today onwards.

Every content that is submitted to the platform will be evaluated by three curators from the panel for its artistic, cultural and infotainment merit.
Only the content recommended by the curators will be showcased on the platform.

K V Abdul Malik, MD, KSFDC, said the launch of the platform will address a major concern of the exhibitors and distributors of the film industry regarding their dwindling profits due to producers releasing their feature films directly on OTT Platforms.
""To accommodate their concerns, CSpace has decided to showcase only those feature films that have been released in cinema halls. Besides, short films, documentaries and experimental films recommended by curators will also be made available on the platform,"" he added.
A plan to set aside a certain amount for the welfare of film professionals is also under consideration.
CSpace will have content related to Kerala culture and arts, besides catering to film students and those who seriously approach films.
Through the platform, there are plans to encourage film clubs across the state including colleges.
Award winning films ""Nishiddho"" and ""B32 to 44"" will be premiered on CSpace.
It also intends to launch a new pattern in crowdfunding by offering filmmakers an opportunity to recoup the production cost through the support of viewers watching their films, the statement added.

Zee targets IPL advertisers with cheaper prime-time packages,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-targets-ipl-advertisers-with-cheaper-prime-time-packages/articleshow/108215271.cms,05-03-2024,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises
has come out with
competitively priced packages
for advertisements during the
Indian Premier League
(IPL) season, according to a senior executive, a move seen making it easier for brands that find IPL
TV broadcaster
Disney Star's rates prohibitive. The packages offered by Zee Entertainment - which has more than 17% share in TV viewership - will allow brands to reach audiences at scale with lower outlays during the IPL period.
The rates of Zee's prime-time
advertisement packages
range from ₹16 crore to ₹35 crore, according to Ashish Sehgal, the company's chief growth officer, ad sales. In comparison, rival
Disney Star
's IPL packages are priced between ₹83 crore and ₹167 crore. Disney Star is also looking to broaden its IPL advertiser base by offering customised packages.
Sehgal said the company has multiple advertisement packages for the IPL period for the varied marketing objectives of advertisers. Sehgal said the company has devised an eight-week plan for brands that wish to outshout their competitors during the IPL. It has shorter duration four- and six-week plans.
""Due to the high cost of IPL on TV, marketers have reduced ticket sizes on the property and spread thin across genres. IPL's impact will be minimal in Q4 and Q1 FY25,"" he said.
Advertisers, Sehgal said, have realised that they must have sustained presence throughout the year for brand imagery. Live sporting events like the IPL and ICC World Cup impact entertainment channels' viewership and revenue from advertisements. For the quarter ended December 2023, Zee's network TV viewership share had dropped to 16.5% due to the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup in October-November 2023.
Live Events
Disney Star's revenue from the sports business had surged by 71% to $399 million for the quarter ended December 31 on the back of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023, severely impacting the general entertainment category.
Zee is eyeing double-digit growth in advertising revenue in the next few quarters on the back of strong performance in regional and movie channel categories.
The network hopes to increase the yield of its advertisement inventory, particularly in under-indexed markets like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka.
""TV viewing, both in terms of reach and time spent, is on the rise, while digital video viewing has reached stagnancy,"" he said.

Senior Advocate Darius
Khambata
appearing for Sony entities informed the tribunal that they were filing two applications.
“We are filing an
application
under Section 45 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, under which a judicial authority (NCLT in the current case) has the power to direct the parties to pursue the matter through arbitration if parties have made such an agreement,” argued Khambata.
“Another application is challenging the maintainability of Zee Entertainment’s plea seeking implementation of the merger scheme of Sony and Zee in India.”
Gathi Prakash Karrah, partner of law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangldas, appearing for the
Zee Entertainment
argued that they will need time to file their replies.
The Zee counsel also argued that if the maintainability applications are taken up on March 12, then Zee would not have sufficient time to file replies, especially if Sony insists on filing rejoinders before 12 March.
Earlier, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT had clubbed Zee's plea with that of its shareholder Mad Man Film Ventures and has posted the matter for hearing on March 12.
Both Zee and Mad Man Film Ventures have approached the NCLT seeking implementation of the merger scheme between Sony and Zee. Sony had earlier called Mad Man Film Ventures as a proxy for Zee.
The tribunal had also issued notices to Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment asking them to file a reply on Zee's application.

NCLT adjourns hearing on Star India-Novi Digital merger,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/nclt-adjourns-hearing-on-star-india-novi-digital-merger/articleshow/108092690.cms,29-02-2024,"The National Company Law Tribunal (
NCLT
) adjourned the
hearing
in the
scheme
of arrangement between Walt Disney-owned
Star India
and its subsidiary
Novi Digital
Entertainment, which owns the streaming platform Disney+ Hotstar, to March 27.
The hearing was postponed on February 21 because the Indian Performing Right Society (IPRS), which opposes the scheme, has informed the NCLT that its application challenging the tribunal's dismissal order dated February 9 has been held for judgment by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
The NCLT also said that Novi Digital Entertainment and Star India can mention the scheme if the NCLAT pronounces its judgment before the next date of hearing.
The development comes at a time when Walt
Disney
and
Reliance Industries
have reached an agreement to merge Star India and Viacom18.
On February 9, the NCLT dismissed the IPRS' application challenging the legal validity of the scheme of arrangement between Star India and Novi Digital Entertainment. The IPRS, which claims to be an unsecured creditor of both entities, had contended that the two parties had gone ahead with the scheme of arrangement without its consent.

The NCLT had ruled that postponing or staying the scheme's process based on IPRS' claims would not be appropriate as its locus to object to the scheme had not been established.
It also said that the proposed scheme provides sufficient scope for IPRS' interests to be protected in the event its credentials as a creditor get established.
The IPRS has claimed dues of Rs 128 crore from Star India and Novi Digital Entertainment for the period April 2018 to March 2023 as per its published tariff.
On February 21, the NCLAT reserved its judgment after hearing the counsels of Star India, Novi Digital Entertainment and IPRS in full. It also asked the parties to submit their notes of submissions and citations to the office of the registry through e-filing within three working days.
As per the scheme of arrangement, Novi Digital Entertainment will get amalgamated into Star India, a move that will help the Walt Disney-owned company achieve economies of scale, enable synergies, increase operational efficiencies, put a greater emphasis on growth, make the best use of resources and lower costs.
In meetings held on February 8, 2023, the boards of both Star India and Novi Digital Entertainment accepted the
merger
plan with effect from April 1, 2022.

With this fund infusion, RIL's total investment in the media business amounts to ₹22,000 crore in the past year. In April 2023, it had invested over ₹10,839 crore as part of a ₹15,145 crore fund injection in Viacom18 that saw Bodhi Tree Systems invest ₹4,306 crore. Bodhi Tree is promoted jointly by James Murdoch and Shankar.
On a post-money basis, the Star-Viacom18 venture will be valued at ₹70,352 crore ($8.5 billion). RIL, Viacom18, and Disney will own 16.34%, 46.82%, and 36.84% of the venture, respectively. Currently, the RIL group including TV18 holds 71.02% in Viacom18 followed by Bodhi Tree at 15.97% and Paramount at 13.01%.
Shankar said the venture ""is poised to shape the future of entertainment in India"". He had led Star under both Fox and Disney before calling it quits in December 2020.
Based on the shareholding in the joint venture, Viacom18's stake is valued at approximately $4 billion, while that of Star is slightly over $3 billion, a far cry from the $15 billion that it once commanded. Disney had acquired Star as part of a $71 billion Fox entertainment asset acquisition in 2019, during Iger's previous tenure at Disney.
The venture will be granted exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India, with a licence to more than 30,000 Disney content assets, providing a full suite of entertainment options for the Indian consumer, according to the statement.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory, shareholder and customary approvals.
The deal will see the exit of Paramount Global from Viacom18. Last year, Paramount's stake was diluted to 13% from 49% after a fund infusion by Reliance and Bodhi Tree Systems.
The merged entity will have over 100 TV channels such as Colors, StarPlus, StarGOLD, Star Sports and Sports18, spread across entertainment and sports, besides two streaming platforms, Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema.
It will have all the key sports rights such as Indian Premier League (IPL), International Cricket Council (ICC) and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) matches. It will also have the rights for the Indian Super League and the
Pro Kabaddi League
. Disney may contribute additional media assets to the venture, pending regulatory and third-party approvals.

From September to a shaadi: How Disney found a new home for Mickey Mouse in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/from-september-to-a-shaadi-how-disney-found-a-new-home-for-mickey-mouse-in-india/articleshow/108083395.cms,29-02-2024,"Ever since he landed in
Mumbai
a week or so ago to help give the final touches to the
Reliance-Star India
mega
merger
that was announced on Wednesday, Justin Warbrooke had been struck by a sense of déjà vu. Many years ago, Warbrooke, a Kiwi by birth but with a cool quotient that is innately Californian, had flown into and camped for weeks in India’s financial capital to play matchmaker and close another strategic transaction for his firm —
Walt Disney Co
’s buyout of
Ronnie Srewvala
’s
UTV Software Communications Ltd
, in tranches starting 2006. He was a young executive then, but handles a senior role in Corporate and Business Strategy.
A lot of time has lapsed between the two trades. Mumbai arguably is more polluted, a skyline that resembles a mashup between Singapore and Dubai but minus the infrastructure. Yet some things remain the same.
If the UTV investment and subsequent buyout gave Walt
Disney
a chance to make a comeback after its first India tie up with KK Modi Group in 1993 went south, the merger with
Mukesh Ambani
’s flagship
Reliance Industries
is expected to give the US media giant, a fresh lease of life in Asia’s biggest streaming market after several missteps ranging from losses in sports to losing top talent.
In retrospect, with the UTV deal also underachieving compared to what was originally envisaged, Disney-Reliance had to be a case of being third time lucky.
ET spoke to several executives and officials to piece together all the action that played out behind the scenes of this $8.5 billion stock and cash corporate alliance that is no less racy than a thriller. Most spoke on condition of anonymity. The genesis was in the fall of 2023 and a climax just before the grand pre-wedding party for Ambani’s youngest son Anant in Jamnagar this weekend -- all in a span of five months or so. That’s in sharp contrast with another mega merger that took two years to be called off last month.

Disney to the party
The entire Disney top brass including chief executive Bob Iger, advisor Kevin Mayer, Walbrook and K Madhavan Country Manager and President, Disney Star in India are expected to attend the three day jamboree in Jamnagar as special guests.
Interestingly, that is where the two main actors of this biggest media story playing across television screens and OTT platforms in India today -- Mukesh Ambani, the 66 yr old chairman of Reliance Industries, also the richest man of the country, and his peer Robert “Bob” Iger will meet in person for the first time ever since the negotiations between both sides began around last September. Both stayed away from the deal maths, manoeuvres or the merger minutiaes. Instead they sent two of their key lieutenants Manoj Modi and Mayers to hammer it out on the playing field.
Mayer, once seen as Iger’s likely successor, especially after the launch of Disney+, who had worked closely with the CEO on a series of acquisitions and was a key architect of Disney’s streaming strategy before leaving the firm to start Candle Partners, also a media group, only to be cherry picked and parachuted back last July to “turn around” Disney after Iger was brought in 2022 and then given a 2 year extension to fix the behemoth that was broken in every corner – soaring expenses, furious fans of its once vaunted theme parks, striking screenwriters, dipping revenues, uneven performance of Lucasfilm and Disney’s animation and live-action releases and activist shareholders baying for blood.
Mission India
Mayer’s India mandate from Iger was simple: a holistic solution and not piecemeal slump sale of assets or businesses. An exit from one of the most promising markets that is consuming content on terabytes of free data was also out of the question.
For both Mayer and his colleague Tom Staggs who also had left Disney to start Candle, with the backing of Blackstone, but brought back as Iger’s “advisors”, the world’s largest PE firm was an obvious pit stop.
They have a sizable presence in India and had over the years scoped several media assets including Sony’s local operations, Airtel DTH, Dish TV and Eenadu; and had bought into Jagran Media Network. It had also weighed a co-investment with Star in Asianet for a minority stake, after Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling interest in the Kerala-based network from Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a former telecom-and-media business magnate and the current minister of state for electronics and information technology. Madhavan, himself was the managing director and CEO of Asianet at the time.
In parallel, Madhavan too was talking to potential suitors including Carlyle to put together an investment consortium that would pump in at least a billion dollars and resuscitate Star India and consolidate his position, people aware said.
But for any financial investor, this was a tough call with Jio changing the rules of the game by offering free streaming and cheap data. The financial returns were just not stacking up. “Media in India is also a highly regulated sector with sparring media conglomerates,” said an executive in the know on condition of anonymity. “Which PE firm would want to take on Reliance in India.” None of those conversations therefore moved ahead much.
Return of the Jedi
Enter Reliance.
As talks progressed, Mayer had roped in Walbrooke, a rainmaker who now wears many hats -- head of international finance, CFO, direct-to-consumer business, and international head of business operations, to help him . Walbrooke, himself a company man, joined as a manager after a stint in consulting about two decades back, knew what his bosses and board were seeking.
Once the broad contours were in place, it gathered momentum after Walbrooke visited the Reliance Mumbai office in October followed by Mayer and Modi catching up just before Christmas at the Ambani residence in Stoke Park, London, to shake hands and sign a non binding term sheet with a February 17th deadline.
Both businesses too were to be treated as similar-sized ones, a far cry from Star India’s $15 billion valuation that was often thrown around after Murdoch family crown jewel was acquired in 2019.
Meanwhile, bankers, the valuation specialists from the big and a bevy of lawyers were already tasked to draw out the finer points. By November, the structure too was also clear – create a step-down subsidiary of Viacom18 Media, which will absorb Star India via a stock swap to avoid significant equity dilution of existing partners of Viacom 18.
Viacom18’s entertainment network in the country is a partnership between Ambani’s TV18 Broadcast, Paramount Global and Bodhi Tree Systems.
The combined business also needed money largely on account of the mounting losses of Disney’s sports franchise in India after its jaw dropping Rs 23,575 crore IPL TV rights for the 2023-27 cycle. Iger was not over eager putting more cash at this juncture considering globally it only just about “turned a corner” in the quarter ending February 2024 and announced a $3 billion share buyback programme and a 50% dividend increase to soothe its investors' nerves. So Reliance Industries stepped in with a cheque of Rs 11,500 crore (~$ 1.4 billion). That made Reliance Group (including Viacom 18) the controlling shareholder with 63.16% shareholding.
“Both Reliance, Disney are no pushovers. Both were looking at scale, and Disney retained a meaningful stake for future upside. This is a happy ending for both.” quipped a Reliance executive. “This is a merger but with unequal shareholding.”
Two sides are putting equity instead of one buying the other out for cash. Even the junior shareholder will have rights, added a Disney executive, just before picking his wedding wardrobe for Ambani Junior and Radhika Merchant wedding nuptials with echoes of another union in the background.

View: Sony’s spurned target shows the pitfalls of tempting Indian M&A,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/view-sonys-spurned-target-shows-the-pitfalls-of-tempting-indian-ma/articleshow/108025410.cms,27-02-2024,"Sony Group
Corp. dodged a bullet when its lawyers nixed a $10 billion Indian merger that executives had spent two years trying to bring to fruition. The spurned target hasn’t been as lucky.
Zee
Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. has no other suitors on the horizon, and its founders’ mounting legal troubles are threatening to engulf the firm.
To foreign investors, the Sony-Zee saga is a reminder of the need to approach Indian deals with an abundance of caution. In 2008,
Daiichi Sankyo
Co. shelled out $4.6 billion to buy
Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd., a generic drugmaker, from New Delhi-based brothers Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh. Shortly after, US regulators barred more than 30 drugs made at two of the Indian company's plants and halted reviews of new products at one of the factories because the firm had falsified data. Daiichi got pulled into a rabbit hole to win an arbitration award against the brothers for suppressing facts, and then to get it enforced.
Sixteen years later, governance at many Indian family-controlled firms isn’t any better. The market watchdog, which is investigating Zee’s founder
Subhash Chandra
and his son
Punit Goenka
, the chief executive officer, for siphoning funds from the publicly traded firm, has found a 20 billion rupee ($241 million) diversion, roughly 10 times bigger than what was revealed to a preliminary probe.
The near-15% slump in shares that followed the Bloomberg News report — denied by the company as “incorrect, baseless and false” — puts the onus on the father-son duo. They have an opportunity to tell their side of the story to the Securities and Exchange Board of India before the SEBI finalizes its report on alleged governance lapses by April. Yet, what Zee actually did was to blame the “negative public opinion” on misinformation. On Friday, the board set up an advisory panel to curb “erosion of investor wealth.”
The time for fighting words is long past. The very survival of India’s oldest private television franchise is at stake. For one thing, Zee had about $100 million in cash in December. Sony has initiated arbitration proceedings in Singapore against it, seeking a $90 million breakup fee.

Zee Entertainment refutes report of Rs 2,000 cr accounting gaffe, says it is 'false'
Second, the Mumbai-based firm skipped a $200 million payment to Walt
Disney
Co. last month, citing a liquidity crunch. This is part of a $1.4 billion license agreement with Disney to telecast some cricket matches for which the US entertainment giant holds the rights.
Wriggling out of the arrangement may not be financially painless for Zee. Disney has just entered into a binding pact with
Mukesh Ambani
’s Reliance Industries Ltd. to combine their Indian media operations. Asia’s richest tycoon, who is expected to own at least a 61% stake in the merged entity, might insist that Disney extract as much out of the contract with Zee as possible.
The third crucial issue is the control of Zee’s affairs by a shareholder group with less than 4% ownership. Sony wrongly thought that the best way into the marquee asset was to be Chandra’s white knight. Its merger proposal even gave the founding family the option to raise its depleted shareholding to 20%.
Luckily for Sony, the SEBI’s preliminary report, alleging that Zee had faked the recovery of loans owed by founder Chandra’s private entities, came before the merger had been concluded. The father and son are contesting the SEBI’s findings, but honoring the agreement to let Goenka helm the merged entity became impossible with the sword of regulatory action hanging over the Zee CEO. The transaction collapsed in January.

But while Sony might have gotten away by the skin of its teeth, Zee’s finances are deteriorating. Annual profit has fallen by 95%, its content inventory is shrinking, and the network's 17% market share is holding up only at the expense of profit margins. And that brings us to a fourth point: The competitive landscape has changed vastly from when Sony and Zee shook hands in 2021. A Disney-Ambani marriage is set to create a formidable No. 1., with a complete lockdown on cricket in a country crazy about the sport.
Meanwhile, Zee will struggle in the absence of the fresh capital that Sony was proposing to infuse. A new suitor is the only other option. The acquisitive tycoon
Gautam Adani
fits the bill of someone who may relish the competition with arch rival Ambani. Now that the infrastructure czar has seen off allegations of governance lapses at his own transportation and energy empire, he may not be averse to establishing a foothold in India’s consumer economy with telecom and media, where Ambani calls the shots.
Still, Adani may not want to step into the breach until the legal and accounting dust around Zee has settled. (In that case, Sony, too, may want to return to the negotiating table.) But the chances of a good outcome are fading fast. Investors voted down the reappointment of two directors in December, while another withdrew his nomination. Shareholders, who have seen a franchise worth $9 billion in 2018 collapse to $2 billion, are unlikely to be satisfied with the latest campaign to reestablish credibility by a board that is itself grasping for legitimacy. The company that brought private satellite TV to India may be remembered as another Ranbaxy: a warning to foreign buyers to curb their enthusiasm.
Perhaps the only kind of mergers and acquisitions that makes sense is where a multinational such as Disney inherits a good Indian asset from another — like Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc. — and flips it over to a prominent local billionaire, keeping a minority stake to ride the upside. Selling control to Indian families may be a whole lot easier than buying it from them. Taking a leaf from Disney CEO Bob Iger’s playbook, it may not be a bad idea for Sony to invite Adani as a majority partner in its local media operations. Otherwise, the Japanese network will find itself fighting Ambani all alone — minus the added heft of a Zee merger.

The stake split between the partners may change, depending on how Disney’s other local assets are factored in by the time the deal is closed, the people said.
Disney owns a minority stake in broadcast service provider, Tata Play Ltd., which
Reliance
may consider acquiring, according to local news reports.
Disney has been grappling with challenges in India such as retaining subscribers and securing coveted media assets, while Reliance has cornered a larger slice of the local media and entertainment businesses in recent years. Together, they would make a formidable media behemoth in one of the world’s fastest-growing entertainment markets.
Ambani’s unit had outbid Disney in 2022 to win the streaming rights for the Indian Premier League, or IPL, cricket tournament and bagged a multi-year pact in April to broadcast Warner Bros Discovery Inc.’s HBO shows, which were earlier with Disney.
Clawing Back
While Disney’s streaming service, Disney+ Hotstar, managed to draw record viewers for the Cricket World Cup in October and November, it showed the matches for free in the cricket-crazy nation — a move aimed at clawing back subscribers even if it meant sacrificing revenue. Reliance had streamed IPL matches earlier in 2023 without any charge, drawing viewers in hordes.
Disney has been mulling options for its India business, including an outright sale or setting up a joint venture with partners since July.
This transaction is part of the larger consolidation efforts in the Indian media and entertainment space. Sony Group Corp. planned to merge its local unit with
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
until differences cropped up on who’ll lead the new merged media giant that ultimately gutted the deal last month.

The series, based on the Sheena Bora case, was scheduled to be aired on Friday. Meanwhile, a division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Manjusha Deshpande have decided to hear the case next week, that is on February 29.
While an accused has rights, even the prosecution and victim in a case have rights, it noted. Senior counsel Ravi Kadam, appearing for Netflix, initially opposed and said this would amount to pre-censorship.
He added that the CBI ought to have moved the court against the series earlier and should not have waited till the last moment. The bench, however, said that the trial in the case was still ongoing and statements of witnesses are still being recorded. ""It (release of the series) can be deferred for a week...Heavens are not going to fall,"" the HC said.
Live Events
The CBI had filed a petition in the high court, seeking a stay on its release till the trial in the case is complete, as the
web series
could affect the investigation of the case, its outcome and people's perception. According to the CBI, 89 witnesses out of 237 have been examined so far before the trial court.
The court on Thursday was also informed by Kadam that five witnesses have been interviewed in the series, including Indrani's son Mikhail (Sheena's brother) and Vidhie Mukerjea, Indrani's daughter from Peter Mukerjea. Kadam said the statements of three witnesses from these five are yet to be recorded by the trial court.
The docu-series deals with the disappearance of 25-year-old Sheena Bora, daughter of Indrani Mukherjea, who is currently facing trial for murder.
Bora was allegedly strangled to death in a car by Indrani, her then driver Shyamvar Rai and former husband Sanjeev Khanna in April 2012. Bora was Indrani's daughter from her previous relationship. Her body was burnt in a forest in the neighbouring Raigad district.

User Additions: It's a mixed bag for DTH companies,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/user-additions-its-a-mixed-bag-for-dth-companies/articleshow/107892336.cms,21-02-2024,"The third quarter saw mixed results for pay
DTH
platforms, with strong subscriber additions during the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup in October and November countered by losses in December as subscribers shifted to alternative platforms like OTT and DD Free Dish, industry officials said.
The pay DTH industry gained an estimated 1 million+ subscribers in October and November and lost an equal number of subscribers in December making Q3 a zero-sum game for the industry.
Dish TV
CEO Manoj Dobhal stated that the DTH industry did not lose any subscribers in Q3 FY24, but it also did not gain any subscribers despite robust additions from the cricket world cup due to churn.
""The DTH industry added over 1 million customers on the back of the World Cup in October/November and lost an equal number of subscribers in December. At a net level, there was no gain for the industry,"" he stated.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the total active pay DTH subscriber base stood at 64.18 million. The total active subscriber data provided by Trai includes subscribers who were inactive or temporarily suspended for 90 days whereas DTH operators have different internal metrics to count active subscribers.
Live Events
Senior TV distribution executives said that the pay DTH industry has been decreasing every month since the World Cup ended.
""The two months of the World Cup were great for the DTH industry. However, the subscriber churn started after the World Cup concluded. That said, churn is hurting
Cable TV
more than DTH,"" a top executive said, requesting anonymity.
Leading the pack on the customer acquisition front,
Bharti Airtel
's DTH unit,
Airtel Digital TV
, achieved 0.38 million net additions in Q3, its highest in the previous 12 quarters.
""On the DTH business, we added 3,88,000 customers. This is the highest net addition that we have seen in the last 12 quarters. Revenue growth was driven by both customer adds and
ARPU
increases,"" Bharti Airtel CEO (India & South Asia) Gopal Vittal told analysts during the Q3 earnings call on February 6.
""Our strategy to focus on key markets in the South,
Maharashtra
, and Bengal, combined with our pivot to convergence, creates a solid differentiation for our DTH business in the market,"" he added.
Dish TV claimed to have logged the best Q3 since FY19 in terms of new subscriber additions on the back of special schemes and offers to leverage the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup and a packed festive season.
However, the company reported high churn rates despite significant incremental acquisitions, leading to negative net additions in the quarter.

Geetmala
,' passed away at the age of 91 yesterday. The news was confirmed by his son,
Rajil Sayani
, who stated that
Ameen Sayani
breathed his last at the hospital last night. The cause of his demise has been attributed to heart failure. Sayani's funeral is scheduled for Thursday, awaiting the arrival of some relatives in Mumbai on Wednesday.
Who was Ameen Sayani?
""Namaskar bhaiyon aur behno, main aapka dost Ameen Sayani bol raha hoon,"" resonated the voice emanating from the vintage radio sets, captivating living rooms nationwide. His style gained popularity when All India Radio restricted the broadcast of Bollywood songs, becoming a platform for promoting simple Hindustani, resonating with audiences across India.
Ameen Sayani, born on December 21, 1932, in Mumbai. Born into a family deeply rooted in literature—his mother published a newsletter named Rehbar and his brother was the renowned English broadcaster Hamid Sayani—Ameen Sayani embarked on his Radio Ceylon journey in 1952. He was initially an English broadcaster but later transitioned to Hindi post-independence. He gained immense popularity with the creation of 'Geetmala,' a groundbreaking show that first aired in December 1952. The program, which featured chart-topping hits, became a cultural phenomenon in South Asia.
Ameen Sayani Hosted the Iconic
Cibaca Geetmala
Binaca Geetmala, initially a 30-minute program, skyrocketed in 1952 and persisted for decades, undergoing name changes such as Binaca Geetmala, Hit Parade, and Cibaca Geetmala. Sayani's 'Geetmala' was not only a musical extravaganza but also showcased his deep understanding of the evolving musical landscape. The show's success solidified his status as a radio maestro. It ran from 1952 to 1994, with subsequent revivals in 2000-2001 and 2001-2003. The show's name underwent slight variations, but its essence remained the same.

Additionally, he is recognized in the Limca Book of Records for his contributions to approximately 19,000 jingles as a voiceover artist.
The entertainment world mourns the loss of Ameen Sayani, a legend who revolutionized radio broadcasting in India. His contribution to the industry will always be remembered. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.

DTH
) platform
Dish TV
has adopted a three-pronged strategy to acquire new customers and retain existing ones as it aims to become net positive in customer additions in FY25,
CEO Manoj Dobhal
told ET.
Once India’s largest DTH platform,
Dish
TV has been steadily losing ground due to competition in the market and a tussle between promoters led by Jawahar Goel and other investors, including
Yes Bank
, which has now transferred its 24% shareholding to
JC Flowers
. Dish TV promoters own a 4% stake in the company.
Having become debt-free in Q1, the DTH company is now looking to reclaim the lost ground and become a competitive force in a market that is changing rapidly due to the evolution of
technology
. According to a recent TRAI report, Dish TV had roughly 14 million subscribers.
According to Dobhal, Dish TV plans to acquire premium customers through Android set-top boxes (STBs), which support both linear TV and over-the-top (OTT) streaming.
It also has an OTT aggregation service, Watcho, which has amassed 3.6 million paid subscriptions and offers 17 OTT apps and over 200 linear TV channels.

To prevent the migration of lower-end customers to DD Free Dish, Dobhal said the company has launched Zing Super STBs, which come with a two-year validity and offer over 200 free-to-air (FTA) channels.
Zing Super customers can also add pay channels, a facility that is not available in DD Free Dish, the Dish TV CEO added.
“Having become debt-free, we are increasing our investments to grow the business. We plan to deploy only high-definition (HD) and Android STBs going forward,” Dobhal stated.
In the last few years, DTH operators have seen an exodus of customers to OTT and DD Free Dish, the free DTH platform of Prasar Bharati.
Dobhal said that the pay DTH industry has 55 million active subscribers, while DD Free Dish is estimated to have 45 million customers.
He noted that Dish TV’s third strategy to add new customers is to partner with local cable operators (LCOs) by allowing them to own the customer. In this model, Dish TV will provide STBs and content to LCOs, while the latter will service the customer.
The Dish TV CEO noted that this is a unique model in the TV distribution industry wherein a DTH operator is partnering with LCOs. DTH operators typically directly own the customers without any intermediaries.
“It’s a win-win for both Dish TV and LCOs, as we will add new customers through them while they will get to retain the customers. LCOs’ Capex and Opex will be reduced by partnering with us. Our costs will also come down as we don’t have to service these LCO-owned customers,” he stated.
Dobhal said Dish TV doesn’t see cable TV as a competition anymore, which is bearing the brunt of cord-cutting by customers. Cable TV is losing customers at a faster clip than DTH.

""We wish to clarify that the company is not aware of any information that has not been announced to the exchanges which could explain the aforesaid movement in the trading, and we are not in a position to determine the material impact of the above-mentioned article on the company,"" it further stated.
Re-engaged in talks
Earlier, ET had reported that Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) has re-engaged with Sony Group Corp in a last-ditch attempt to revive their $10-billion merger, which had been officially called off on January 22.
Representatives from the two sides have held meetings across locations in Mumbai and efforts to salvage the deal have gathered momentum over the last fortnight. However, major differences are yet to be sorted out, and that could yet lead to the failure of the renewed talks, with both sides sticking firmly to their positions, as per executives aware of the matter.

Legal Tussles
Following the termination of deal talks late last month, Mad Man Film Ventures, which Sony has called a proxy for Zee, moved the NCLT seeking implementation of the merger scheme between Sony and ZEEL. Sony’s India units Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment have filed applications before the NCLT challenging the maintainability of ZEEL’s application seeking implementation of the merger scheme.
In its January 24 plea at the NCLT, Zee asked the tribunal to prevent Sony Group-owned firms from adopting any further steps that could jeopardise the implementation of the scheme.
The Mumbai bench of the NCLT has clubbed ZEEL's plea with that of shareholder Mad Man Film Ventures and has posted the matter for hearing on March 12, ET reported February 6. Mad Man Film Ventures has also urged the tribunal to appoint a committee comprising two directors each from Zee and Sony to oversee the implementation of the composite scheme of arrangement.
On February 4, the SIAC denied emergency interim relief to the Sony Group-owned entities against Zee, stating it has no jurisdiction to prevent the latter from approaching the NCLT and that the tribunal is the appropriate forum to handle the dispute.
The Goenka family owns 3.99% equity in ZEEL. The rest is held by public and institutional shareholders.
After the two media giants terminated talks on January 22, Zee’s
stock
rose as much as 14%. However, over the past month, it’s dropped 24%. Indian mutual funds and insurance companies including
LIC
hold 31% of the company. FIIs owned 28.19% as per December 2023 data.
Zee
had told analysts after its third-quarter earnings call that it plans to review the entire business portfolio following the collapse of the merger.
“We will be relooking at the entire portfolio of the business to see which businesses will add the maximum value to our portfolio and, therefore, what we need to focus on, and what we do not need to focus on going forward,"" Goenka had told analysts.

As per the merger conditions, which was agreed upon between Sony and
ZEEL
, the Japanese giant was also supposed to invest USD 1.5 billion in the merged entity.
The group will also continue to pursue organic growth as per its strategy in India, where it operates through Culver Max Entertainment (earlier known as Sony Pictures Network India), he said in the investors call.
Sony had last month terminated an agreement with ZEEL to merge its two Indian entities -- Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment Private Limited (BEPL) -- with ZEEL.
Sony Group Corporation
(SGC) had said ZEEL did not satisfy the merger conditions and initiated arbitration proceedings before SIAC claiming USD 90 million (around Rs 748.5 crore) as a termination fee.
ZEEL filed a petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), seeking a direction to Sony Group to implement the merger scheme.
On February 4, the Singapore International Arbitration Center (SIAC) denied Sony Group's interim plea to restrain ZEEL from moving NCLT for enforcing the failed merger.
The Mumbai bench of NCLT has already issued notice to Sony over a petition filed in this regard.
The NCLT had on August 10, 2023, approved the scheme of merger, which could have created a USD 10 billion media entity.
If the merger was completed, the combined entity would have owned over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services -- ZEE5 and Sony LIV -- and two film studios -- Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India-- making it the largest entertainment network in the country.
Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation, Japan, owns 26 channels which operate in Hindi and several other languages having a viewership of over 700 million.
Besides, it has one OTT platform Sony LIV on which it streams live sports, movies, short films and its original and archival content. It has around 33 million viewers.
The company recorded a revenue of Rs 6,684 crore for FY23.

He further submitted that IPL is approaching near and it will impact its preparation for the coming season.
Dream 11 is the title sponsor of the IPL T20 cricket league also.
Kathpalia also offered to deposit the money and said this was stopped on account of some disputes, as there was no clarity as to whom the payment was to be made.
The NCLT had directed to initiate CIRP against Dream 11 over a petition filed by its operational creditor Reward Solutions under section 9 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC), claiming dues of Rs 7.61 crore.
It had also appointed Madan Bajrang Lal Vaishnawa as IRP for Sporta Technologies.
Interestingly, Reward Solutions itself is going through an insolvency resolution process and the plea was filed by its resolution professional.
In 2019, a license agreement was executed between Reward Business Solutions being the licensor, and Sporta Technologies.
It had leased a premise in Mumbai for five years to Sporta Technologies for which terms of payment were defined.
However, it received a demand note of Rs 7.61 crore on April 20, 2021, for a period of March 27, 2020, till April 2021.
Opposing it, Sports Technologies in its petition filed before the appellate tribunal said the NCLT in its order ignored the fact that the demand ""period from March 27, 2020, to March 26, 2021, is squarely covered/exempted under Section 10A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016"".
""However, under the caption 'Findings', the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) has failed to even comment on, let alone consider, the submission of the Corporate Debtor. On this ground alone, the Impugned Order is bad in law, and deserves to be set aside,"" it said.
Section 10A mandates no application for initiation of a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) can be filed against any debtor by any financial and operational creditor for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020, for a period of one year.
This was a special provision inserted by the government in IBC to help the companies after the economic activities had resumed post-lockdown in phases.

NCLAT tells IRP to take no further steps in Dream11 insolvency; NCLT order stayed,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/nclat-tells-irp-to-take-no-further-steps-in-dream11-insolvency-nclt-order-to-remain-for-now/articleshow/107685399.cms,14-02-2024,"The
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal
, Thursday, noted that the order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal to initiate
insolvency
proceedings against the parent company of India’s largest sports fantasy platform
Dream11
shall be stayed for now
and the insolvency resolution professional may continue to keep the company as a going concern till then, but take no further steps.
“The impugned order
shall stay…
No further steps shall be taken by the
IRP
,” the appellate tribunal noted listing the matter for February 23.
The counsel appearing for the co-founder and COO of Dream11, Bhavit Seth, had requested that no further steps be taken in the insolvency resolution professional, as any action will adversely affect the company which is preparing for the upcoming
IPL
season.
“We will deposit the money here; the reason
payment
stopped was because disputes arose as to who the payment has to be made,” said the senior counsel.
Sporta Technologies was admitted into insolvency under Section 9 of the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy
Code, 2016, earlier this week by the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal for default of payment of Rs 7.61 crore.
Live Events
The tribunal appointed Madan Bajrang Lal Vaishnawa as the interim resolution professional.
The proceedings were initiated by Reward Solutions, which itself is under an insolvency resolution process.
In 2019, the fantasy sports company entered into a lease agreement with Reward Solutions for its office space for five years for a monthly payment of Rs 49.8 lakh for the initial three years and Rs 57.3 lakh for two years, with a three-year lock-in.
Sporta had argued that there was a lack of clarity on who the payment was to be made and that Reward could not be treated as an operational creditor to initiate proceedings.

Zee Entertainment seeks Rs 69 crore refund from Star after failed ICC TV deal,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-entertainment-seeks-rs-69-crore-refund-from-star-after-failed-icc-tv-deal/articleshow/107670174.cms,14-02-2024,"Zee Entertainment
Enterprises has accused Walt Disney-owned
Star India
of violating the
ICC TV
rights agreement and has sought a refund of Rs 69 crore paid as part of the agreement.
Zee asserted in its Q3 financial statements that it has strong grounds to counter Star India's claims in the ICC TV rights agreement matter. The company added that it has accrued Rs 72.1 crore for bank guarantee commission and interest expenses for its share of bank guarantee and deposit as per the agreement.
Star India has sent letters to Zee through its legal counsel accusing the company of breaching the ICC TV rights agreement due to the non-payment of $203.5 million in the first installment of the rights fee along with the payment of the bank guarantee commission deposit of Rs 17 crore.
Zee, on the other hand, has accused Star of failing to comply with the agreement due to its inability to obtain necessary approvals and execute necessary documents and agreements.
The company claimed that the agreement was contingent on financial commitments, bank and corporate guarantees, and final ICC approval for the sub-licencing deal.
Live Events
""The management believes that Star, by its conduct, has breached the Alliance Agreement and is in default of the terms thereof, and consequently, the contract stands repudiated,"" Zee said in its note to the financial statements.
""The company said it has communicated to Star that the alliance agreement cannot be proceeded with for the reasons set out above and has also sought a refund of Rs 68.54 crore paid to Star,"" it added.
Zee said it doesn't anticipate any significant adverse impact from the contract repudiation, and there is no need to make any adjustments to the accompanying statement.
On August 26, 2022, Zee signed an agreement to set out the basis on which Star India would sub-licence the ICC TV rights to the company for men's and u-19 events for four years until 2027.
It is pertinent to note that the Walt Disney-owned company, which is in merger talks with
Reliance Industries
' Viacom18, had acquired the ICC media rights for $3 billion.
As part of its pre-bid understanding with Zee, Disney Star had sub-licenced the ICC TV rights to the company for $1.5 billion. The company retained the ICC digital rights after acquiring the Indian Premier League (IPL) TV rights in the same year.
Zee, which at that time was in the process of merging with
Sony Group
's India unit Culver Max Entertainment, had acquired the ICC TV rights since sports would have been a key focus area for the proposed Sony-Zee merged entity.
Sony was expected to infuse growth capital of $1.5 billion into the merged entity, which would have been deployed for content investments in sports and digital.
The merger, which had been in the works for two years, was called off by Sony last month due to Zee's apparent failure to meet the closing conditions.
Zee's inability to stick to the ICC TV deal has meant that Star will have to service the entire $3 billion contract, which has put a strain on its valuation and is expected to dent its future profits.
ET had reported that Reliance has reduced Star India's valuation by up to $2 billion due to anticipated losses from the ICC contract over the next four years.
Star and Viacom18 are nearing the completion of a merger deal that values both entities at $4 billion each. Disney purchased Star for upwards of $15 billion as part of its $71 billion acquisition of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox in 2019.

Zee to review its entire business portfolio after Sony calls off merger plans,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-to-review-its-entire-business-portfolio-after-sony-calls-off-merger-plans/articleshow/107669785.cms,14-02-2024,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises
plans to review its entire business portfolio following the collapse of a merger with
Sony
Group Corporation's India units.
The exercise is aimed at identifying businesses that generate maximum value and those that need to be focused on,
Punit Goenka
, managing director and chief executive, Zee said during an analysts' call on Tuesday to discuss December quarter earnings.
""We will be relooking at the entire portfolio of the business to see which businesses will add the maximum value to our portfolio and, therefore, what we need to focus on, and what we do not need to focus on going forward,"" Goenka said, responding to an analyst query on the company's plans for the
sports business
.
The termination of the merger deal by the India units of Sony has led to litigation between the two companies.
Zee has a substantial presence in the TV, OTT, music, and film businesses. In 2022, Zee re-entered the sports business by acquiring the media rights for the UAE cricket board's International League T20 and ICC TV rights from
Disney Star
. It had to relinquish the ICC TV rights after the merger with Sony fell through.
Live Events
Meanwhile, Zee’s net profit in the quarter ended December 31 soared 141% to Rs 58.5 crore despite a 3% decline in revenue to Rs 2045 crore.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or Ebitda fell 43% to Rs 209 crore while expenses increased 5.4% to Rs 1836 crore.
Goenka said the company's growth strategy is centred around frugality, optimisation, and quality content, as part of its target to achieve 18–20% Ebitda margin by FY26.
He predicted Ebitda margins will make a gradual recovery in the second half of FY25, with margins in the next financial year set to surpass that of FY24.
Zee will be optimising spends across technology, content, and marketing, with a focus on enhancing return on investment. ""A sound recalibration of the OTT cost structure will be an integral part of this process,"" Goenka said.
While ruling out major layoffs in the company, he hinted the company would tighten its belt on manpower. He also said Zee has not seen any attrition in the last three weeks since the merger deal was terminated by Sony.
""Tightening our belts on manpower will also be part of the plan going forward. Not to say that there are going to be large-scale layoffs; we will have to see overlaps between businesses,"" he said.
Noting that margin improvement will be driven by both TV and OTT businesses, Goenka said investments in ZEE5, the company's OTT business, have peaked and quarterly losses are reducing.
ZEE5's Q3 operating loss narrowed 13.4% to Rs 244 crore while revenue rose 15% to Rs 223 crore.

Dream11 declined to comment on ET's queries.
The insolvency petition was filed before the NCLT by the resolution professional of
Reward Solutions
after Sporta had supposedly defaulted on its dues of Rs 7.61 crore. The NCLT in its order had appointed Madan Bajarang Lal Vaishnawa as the interim resolution professional to take care of the resolution process.
The matter dates back to December 2019 when Reward Solutions, the owner of the office premises at Lower Parel in Mumbai, executed a five-year lease and licence agreement with Sporta Technologies.

The agreement had a 33-month 'lock-in period' till September 27, 2022, during which neither party could have terminated the agreement.
Reward Solutions claimed that from the beginning of the agreement period Sporta Technologies had failed to pay the licence fees.
However, Sporta Technologies argued that the licence fees had to be negotiated, and that could not be done due to Covid-19. It further alleged that there was no clarity on who the owner of the premises was - Reward Solutions or a third party called Mangalam Vanijya.
Sporta Technologies also informed the tribunal that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had issued a provisional attachment order concerning the leased premises.
Further, the unicorn said that the debt was defaulted within the Section 10A period of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, (IBC) as a result, it said Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) couldn’t be initiated against it.
The government had introduced Section 10A to the IBC prohibiting applications for CIRP initiation for defaults arising after March 25, 2020, for six months or such a period not exceeding one year from the date.
The tribunal, on its part, held that Sporta Technologies owed an operational debt to Reward Solutions, and there was no pre-existing dispute regarding the debt between the parties.
""Considering the above facts, we are of the considered view that this petition deserves to be admitted under Section 9 of the code,"" the tribunal had said in its order.

Sporta Technologies declined to comment on the order.
People close to the development said the matter is most likely to be settled outside the court.
The matter pertains to December 2019, when Mumbai-based Reward Solutions, owner of office premises at Lower Parel in Central Mumbai, entered into a lease and licence agreement with Sporta Technologies for five years.
The agreement had a 33-month lock-in period till September 27, 2022, during which Sporta Technologies could not terminate the agreement.
Reward Solutions argued that Sporta Technologies had failed to pay the licence fee right from the beginning.
However, Sporta Technologies argued that it lost the opportunity to negotiate licence fees due to COVID-19 and confusion over whether Reward Solutions or a third party named Mangalam Vanijya had ownership of the leased premises.
Sporta Technologies added that it had also received a provisional attachment order from the Enforcement Directorate concerning the leased premises.
The company also argued that the debt fell under Section 10A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), leading to the non-maintainability of the petition.
Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government introduced Section 10A to the IBC, prohibiting applications for CIRP initiation for defaults arising after March 25, 2020, for six months or such a period not exceeding one year from the date.
However, the tribunal concluded that Sporta Technologies is a corporate debtor and Reward Solutions has demonstrated the existence of operational debt along with the absence of any pre-existing disputes between the parties.
It said the petition meets legal requirements, including jurisdiction, territoriality and subject matter, and has been filed within a three-year limitation period.
""Considering the above facts, we are of the considered view that this petition deserves to be admitted under Section 9 of the code,"" the tribunal said.
Sporta Technologies, worth $8 billion, reported 32% increase in net profit to Rs 188 crore for 2022-23 and a 66% increase in revenue to Rs 6,384 crore.

Disney's India sports business records $315 million loss due to 2023 WC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/disneys-india-sports-business-records-315-million-loss-due-to-2023-wc/articleshow/107513287.cms,09-02-2024,"The
Walt Disney Company
has revealed that the operating loss from the
sports business
of its India unit has surged 144% to $315 million for the quarter ended December 2023 on account of the 50-over
ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023
in India.
The company's operating loss stood at $129 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal since it had the ICC Men's T20
World Cup
2022, a smaller event compared to the 50-over World Cup. Walt Disney follows the October to September financial calendar.
According to sources familiar with the matter, Star India had allocated 40% of the $1.8-2 billion payout to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the final year of its eight-year media rights deal, which expired in 2023.
Of the 40% allocated to the final year of the rights cycle, 80% was for linear TV rights, and the remaining 20% for digital rights.
ET Online
Live Events
Star India owns and operates over 10 Star Sports-branded channels in SD and HD. The company owns the telecast rights to the Indian Premier League and the International Cricket Council (ICC), among others.
Star India's sports revenue surged 71% to $399 million on the back of strong monetisation from the 50-over World Cup. In the same quarter last fiscal year, the company recorded revenues of $233 million on the back of the 20-over World Cup.
The company said that the ICC
Men's Cricket World Cup
led to an increase in programming and production costs, attributable to higher average costs per match and more matches aired.
Further, it attributed the advertising revenue growth to increased units delivered and higher average viewership, partially offset by a decrease in rates.
Disney's sports business, including ESPN and Star Sports, experienced 4% revenue growth at $4.8 billion, while its operating loss decreased by 37% to $103 million. ESPN recorded $4.4 billion in revenue and $199 million in operating profit.
""Sports operating income improved versus the prior year due to strength at ESPN, partially offset by lower results at Star India, driven by higher rights costs from airing of the ICC Cricket World Cup,"" Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said during the Q1 earnings call.
Meanwhile, Star India's streaming service Disney+ Hotstar has seen a 2% sequential growth in subscriber base to 38.3 million compared to 37.6 million during the quarter ended September.
Disney+ Hotstar's average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $0.70 (Rs 58.07) to $1.28 (Rs 106.19) due to higher advertising revenue and increases in retail pricing, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers from lower-priced markets.
Disney+ witnessed a 1% drop in subscriber base to 111.3 million due to a price hike. Hulu's subscriber base expanded by 2% to 49.7 million.
Johnston said the second quarter net adds are expected to range from 5.5 to 6 million, driven by additions of 7.5 million subscribers domestically, while international core subs are expected to decrease modestly due to changes in wholesale deals and slightly elevated churn impacts from price increases.
Meanwhile, Walt Disney's Q1 FY24 operating profit surged 27% to $3.8 billion while revenues remained flat at $23.5 billion. The company stated that it realised $500 million in cost savings during the quarter and is on track to achieve a savings target of $7.5 billion by the end of the fiscal year.
The company exuded confidence that its streaming business will become profitable in Q4 of this fiscal year after narrowing its operating loss from the segment in Q1.
Disney's entertainment revenue decreased by 7% to $9.9 billion, while its operating profit soared by 153% to $874 million.
Within entertainment, revenue from the linear business declined 12% to $2.8 billion, while streaming revenue grew 15% to $5.5 billion. Operating profit from linear business was down 7% to $1.2 billion, even as operating loss from streaming dropped 86% to $138 million.
Experiences, which comprises the parks division, had a 7% growth in revenue to $9.1 billion while operating profit increased by 8% to $3 billion.

Talking about the development, Deepak said, “Given Jessica’s unparalleled experience in the Asian market, Banijay’s global IPs and marquee concepts, exciting local collaborations, and a focus on India as a production hub for the region, CreAsia Studio is our next growth engine.”
He further added, “We’re confident of Jessica’s leadership to steer us towards a leading presence in the region. Her appointment is also a testament to our commitment to tapping into newer markets and diversifying our portfolio in the vibrant Southeast Asian entertainment sector.”
Talking about her new innings, Jessica Kam-Engle said, ""It’s my privilege to join the Banijay family, and I am excited to lead the strategic expansion in South East Asia. There are vast opportunities to develop local and global IPs with the pool of creative talent from this region, leveraging Banijay’s world-class content production expertise and its global distribution clout. I am looking forward to exciting collaborations with key players in the region.”
Last year, Banijay took full control of Endemol Shine India by acquiring CA Media's 51% stake for $90-100 million. The two companies produce 85–90 scripted and unscripted shows across Hindi and regional languages a year, which is set to rise to 90–100 shows in 2024.

This is the third time EoIs have been called for from prospective bidders after the first two processes were scrapped amidst litigation by previous promoter
Shripal Morakhia
.
Gaming company Nazara has submitted its interest all three times. Creditors are hopeful that unlike last two times the process will be taken to its logical conclusion this time.
""Nazara has shown its interest again and again and we have other bidders too. The litigation around the company has been taken care of so we expect things to pan out positively this time,"" said a second person aware of the process.
In November, the Mumbai bench of the
NCLT
annulled the change of ownership of the “SMAAASH” brand, calling it a “fraudulent” transaction by promoter Morakhia. The court had directed that the brand be transferred back to SEPL.
To be sure, Morakhia has challenged the order in the appellate tribunal, though creditors are confident that the strong NCLT order will not be overruled by the tribunal.
The company owes creditors led by Edelweiss ARC Rs 452 crore. Other lenders to the company are Yes Bank, Sidbi and Mabella Investment Advisors. It was admitted to bankruptcy in May 2022.
RP Bhrugesh Amin has listed gaming machines, go-kart, bowling alleys and other entertainment devices located across 13 centres as assets. SEPL had revenues of Rs 118 crore at the end of March 2023 and has 480 employees. Amin and lead creditor Edelweiss ARC did not reply to an email seeking comment.
The transfer of the brand was a major impediment in finding a buyer as previous EoIs were contingent on the brand being retained. Creditors expect the value of the company which is an ongoing entity to increase due to clarity on the brand ownership.

The tribunal issued notices to Culver Max (formerly known as Sony Pictures Network India) and Bangla Entertainment (BEPL) asking them to file a reply on Zee's application.

""We will continue to vigorously arbitrate the matter in Singapore in front of a full SIAC tribunal and pursue SPNI’s right to terminate the merger agreement and seek a termination fee and other remedies,"" it added.
Ashish Pyasi, Partner, Aendri Legal, said the NCLT has the necessary power and jurisdiction under Section 231 of the Companies Act to implement the compromise or arrangement that it has approved.
""Since the action initiated before SIAC is on termination of a separate contract and fees for the same, the issue before the NCLT is different, and it is to enforce the scheme already approved by it. These may lead to independent findings and relief as the issue will be common in them. It is possible that both remedies can be pursued simultaneously by the parties as both remedies are independent of each other,"" he added.
Sony's India units had terminated their merger agreement with Zee on January 22 citing breaches by the Indian media company and initiated arbitration proceedings against it seeking $90 million in termination fees.
While challenging the grounds on which Sony terminated the merger deal, Zee has approached the NCLT seeking directions for Sony to implement the merger scheme of the arrangement, which was approved by the tribunal on August 10, 2023.
In its plea to NCLT dated January 24, Zee has requested the tribunal to prevent Sony Group-owned firms from adopting any further steps that could jeopardise the implementation of the scheme.
It has also urged the tribunal to appoint a committee comprising two directors each from Zee and Sony companies to oversee the implementation of the composite scheme of arrangement.
The NCLT will hear Zee's plea against Sony's termination notice on Tuesday.
“Sony has the right to defend the merger proceedings before the NCLT, which will consider the condition precedents/provisions of the Scheme read with the merger cooperation agreement and the reasons for its termination,” said Himanshu Vidhani, partner at law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan. “The proceedings before SIAC will take its own time as the emergency arbitrator has decided not to injunct Zee from proceeding before the NCLT.”

“We wish to inform you that the Emergency Arbitrator has passed an award denying the application for emergency interim relief filed by Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment and has determined that the Emergency Arbitrator has no jurisdiction or authority to injunct the company (Zee) from approaching the NCLT to implement the Merger Scheme since these are matters that fall within the statutory system and are for the NCLT to decide,” Zee said in a stock exchange filing.
Legal experts stated that the arbitration proceedings regarding Zee's obligation to pay $90 million in termination fees to Sony will continue.
Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment terminated their merger agreement with Zee on January 22 due to unfulfilled conditions and are seeking $90 million in termination fees.

Sony Group companies requested SIAC to prevent Zee from seeking legal remedies from the NCLT or Indian or international courts until the arbitration proceedings are completed.
Zee and its shareholder Mad Man Film Ventures have filed pleas before the Mumbai bench of the NCLT seeking directions for Sony Group companies to implement the merger scheme.
While Zee's application is expected to be taken up by the NCLT Mumbai bench next week, the division bench of the tribunal on January 30 adjourned the hearing in Mad Man Film's matter to March 12 while allowing the Sony Group companies three weeks to file their reply.
Zee has requested the NCLT to direct Sony Group companies Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment to execute the composite scheme of arrangement and maintain the status quo concerning the merger scheme.
The entertainment giant has also asked the tribunal to prevent Sony Group-owned firms from adopting any further steps that could jeopardise the implementation of the scheme.
It also wants the tribunal to appoint a committee consisting of two directors each from Zee and Sony companies to oversee the implementation of the composite scheme of arrangement.

OTT industry seeks help over anti-tobacco warning regulations,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ott-industry-seeks-help-over-anti-tobacco-warning-regulations/articleshow/107192017.cms,28-01-2024,"The video over-the-top (OTT) sector, grappling with compliance challenges for
anti-tobacco warning regulations
, has sought help from the information and broadcasting ministry and
health ministry
to formulate workable solutions, as the enforcement of current rules may disrupt
content viewing
and impose
extra costs
on platforms.
“We had expressed our concerns to the Ministry of Health in both an official representation on the subject and in a joint meeting with stakeholders and industry associations that the Ministry of Health and MIB (Ministry of Information and Broadcasting) organised,” Producers Guild of India CEO Nitin Ahuja told ET.
OTT companies are implementing the rules partially, hoping the health ministry will find a solution to the current impasse, said a veteran executive with an OTT platform, who did not wish to be identified.
The government has directed OTT platforms to strictly adhere to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply, and Distribution) Amendment Rules, 2023, and has warned of action against non-complying platforms.
The amendment rules, which were issued in May last year and came into effect in September, require OTT platforms such as Disney+ Hotstar, Jio Cinema, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video to display anti-tobacco health spots of 30 seconds, audio-visual disclaimers of 20 seconds and prominent static warnings during the programme.

“It’s the hope of the OTT players that the new secretary, while holding the dual charge of MIB and health ministry, will be able to resolve the impasse,"" the legal head of a leading OTT platform said on condition of anonymity. “In a joint meeting in August last year, former health secretary Sudhansh Pant, who is now the chief secretary of Rajasthan, admitted that a pragmatic solution needs to be found for the OTTs to implement the anti-tobacco warning rules.”
Chandra declined to comment on the matter.
During a meeting between the government and OTT stakeholders in August last year, Chandra took note of the concerns of the OTT platforms regarding the implementation of the rules for the existing library of content, foreign content and the inclusion of health spots in the middle of the content.
He also underlined the need for a realistic implementation strategy and advised against enforcing rules meant for TV and films on OTT because it is a distinct platform.
OTT platforms raised concerns that most foreign content will require editing, which will be a significant challenge for them. They also said that the impact of OTT content on tobacco usage may be less strong than that of traditional cinema because it is subject to viewer discretion.
OTT platforms have also sought relaxation in displaying health spots and statutory warnings, as well as time to comply with the rules, particularly for large content modifications.
In a June 2023 note titled 'New rules for OTTs: Disclaimers for cigarettes and tobacco products', law firm Khaitan & Co. said the amendment intends to curb increasing tobacco consumption among the younger generation. However, it imposes a heavy burden of compliance on the OTT platforms.
“To comply with the amendment, OTT platforms will be required to edit large volumes of content available on their platforms (including content acquired before the amendment was enacted) to incorporate the requisite health warnings and disclaimers in all content available or to be made available on the platforms,” the note said.

I'm an 80-year-old dad and it's great: Oscar winner Robert De Niro gets emotional talking about his seventh child,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/im-an-80-year-old-dad-and-its-great-oscar-winner-robert-de-niro-gets-emotional-talking-about-his-seventh-child/articleshow/107163214.cms,26-01-2024,"Two-time
Oscar
winner
Robert De Niro
got emotional while talking about his seventh child. In an interview to a magazine, iconic actor Robert
De Niro
shared his sentiments on fatherhood, expressing joy and contentment at the age of 80. The two-time Oscar winner, who welcomed his seventh child at the age of 79 in May last year, recently received an Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon.""
De Niro, along with his partner Tiffany Chen, named their newborn daughter Gia, as reported by various media outlets. In a heartfelt conversation with AARP: The Magazine, catered to the 50-and-over age group in the United States, De Niro expressed, ""Everything that I'm consumed with or worried about or this and that just goes away when I look at her. So, that in itself is wondrous.""
The actor, visibly emotional, continued to describe the unique qualities he observes in Gia, saying, ""But she has a very sweet kind of way of looking at you and just taking you in... So I don't know where it's going to go with her later when she gets older but she's thinking and she's observing everything and watching. It's really interesting. So, you know, I'm an 80-year-old dad and it's great, and I want to be around for as long as I can to... enjoy her.”
— ReutersAsia (@ReutersAsia)
De Niro's candid reflections provide a touching insight into the transformative power of parenthood, even at an age where many might not expect it. With his recent accolades and the arrival of his daughter Gia, it's evident that age is no barrier to the profound joy and fulfillment that fatherhood can bring.

Disney Star faces unusual fallout: A potential $2-billion downgrade by Reliance amidst Zee-Sony turmoil,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/disney-star-faces-unusual-fallout-a-potential-2-billion-downgrade-by-reliance-amidst-zee-sony-turmoil/articleshow/107096095.cms,24-01-2024,"Mumbai:
Disney Star
could, in terms of valuation, end up becoming an unusual and immediate victim of the aborted
Sony-Zee
merger.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
disputing its obligations to honour a $1.5-billion sub-licensing deal for the International Cricket Council (
ICC
) has raised the likelihood of an up to $2-billion downgrade of Disney Star by
Reliance
, on anticipated losses from the
media rights
agreement, people privy to the development told ET.
According to Zee, the ICC TV contract with Disney Star was contingent on successful completion of Zee's merger with
Sony
, said the people cited. Disney Star disputes this claim.
A person familiar with discussions said
Reliance Industries
had been closely monitoring the Sony-Zee merger developments because the ICC TV deal was linked to it, with direct implications for Disney Star's valuations.
India's biggest company is seeking a merger of Disney Star with its own media businesses.

""Reliance had prepared two scenarios for Disney Star's valuations - one with ICC TV rights obligations, and the other without them, with a potential $2-billion downgrade if Disney Star also services the ICC TV deal, besides the digital rights,"" said one of the people cited above.
Last week, the ICC confirmed that Disney Star will provide television and digital coverage of the ICC U19 Men's Cricket World Cup 2024 on Star Sports and Disney+ Hotstar, respectively.
Disney Star has also factored in the ICC television rights deal in its recently released tariffs by raising the bouquet price roughly 10%, despite losing the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) media rights.
Disney Star and Reliance declined to comment.
ET earlier reported that Reliance and Walt Disney had signed a non-binding term sheet to merge Viacom18 and Disney Star. Due diligence and valuation exercises are ongoing.
If the Reliance-Disney deal materialises, it will create a media goliath, with roughly Rs 25,000 crore in combined revenues.
In an unprecedented fall, the Zee stock was down almost 33% on the BSE on Tuesday after Japan's Sony Corp decided to call off its proposed merger with Zee after two years of talks and despite receiving several regulatory approvals. The merger would have created one of India's biggest media companies across platforms as diverse as cable TV, OTT and films.
Media Rights
A top-level executive with a leading media firm that participated in the ICC rights bidding said the likely losses for Disney Star from the ICC deal could be upward of $1.5 billion, since the difference between the winning bid and rival offers - from Viacom18 and Sony Group Corporation-owned Culver Max Entertainment - is massive.
""Disney Star had bid $3 billion for ICC media rights based on its understanding with Zee, whereas Viacom18 and Sony had offered bids worth $1.3-1.4 billion for the property. The losses from the property will be massive since they have overpaid by a huge margin,"" said this executive, requesting not to be named.
The executive pointed out that if the Sony-Zee deal had succeeded, and Zee had honoured the pact with Disney Star, the ICC TV deal could have potentially eaten into the proposed merged entity's profits, since monetisation would have been difficult due to the split in television and digital rights.
The rising value of digital rights has made it unaffordable for a single entity to acquire both TV and digital exclusivity to big-ticket cricket properties.
""Sony had to accept Zee's decision to acquire the ICC TV rights, even though it was unviable since the merger had not received the Competition Commission of India's clearance by then and the two companies were operating independently,"" said the executive.

Earlier, Sony Group Corporation, in a filing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said CME today issued a notice terminating the definitive agreements entered into by SPNI and ZEEL.
According to Sony, the definitive agreements provided that if the merger did not close within 24 months after their signature date (the end date), the parties would be required to discuss in good faith an extension of the end date required to make the merger effective by a reasonable period.
Sony added that the definitive agreements further provided that if the parties are unable to agree upon such an extension by the end of the discussion period, any party could terminate the definitive agreements by providing written notice.
""The merger did not close by the end date as, among other things, the closing conditions to the merger were not satisfied by then,"" the company said in a statement.
The statement also noted that SPNI has been engaged in discussions in good faith to extend the end date, but the discussion period has expired without an agreement upon an extension of the end date.
""As a result, on January 22, 2024, SPNI issued a notice to ZEEL terminating the definitive agreements,"" it added.
Sony said it has not included the impact of the merger in its consolidated financial results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, which was announced on November 9, 2023, and does not anticipate any material impact on its consolidated financial results as a result of the termination of the definitive agreements for the merger.

Kulkarni said footfalls have remained below pre-pandemic levels as audiences have turned selective in their theatrical choices because of post-pandemic inertia and the rise of video streaming platforms.
The average ticket price (ATP) increased by 9% over 2022, from Rs 119 to Rs 130, owing to a growth in box office contribution from Hindi cinema, which has a higher ATP compared to South-language films.
After a lacklustre performance in the post-pandemic phase, Hindi films had a record year in 2023, with gross box office collection of Rs 5,380 crore, crossing the Rs 5,000 crore mark for the first time.
According to the report, Hindi cinema's box office share hit a pre-pandemic high of 44%, from 33% in 2022. Tamil and
Telugu
cinemas maintained their 2022 share with a box office collection of Rs 2,265 crore and Rs 1,961 crore, respectively in 2023.
Meanwhile, the share of Hollywood movies fell by 3 percentage points in 2022 due to the absence of a Rs 200-crore grossing film, with overall collection at Rs 1,139 crore.
Kannada
cinema shed its box office share by 5% points to finish the year at Rs 312 crore due to the absence of big-ticket films.
Box office collections are getting increasingly skewed in favour of big-ticket films, with the top 10 films contributing 40% of the total box office receipts of Rs 12,226 crore.
Kulkarni said audiences are more likely to watch a film in a theatre if there is a compelling reason to do so. He added that franchise films are gaining traction and engagement across languages, accounting for 45% of theatrical box office collection, up from 17% in 2019.
Over 1,000 films were released in 2023; however, only five films crossed the gross box office of Rs 500 crore.
Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan was the highest-grossing film of 2023, making Rs 734 crore, followed by Ranbir Kapoor's Animal (Rs 645 crore), Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan (Rs 636 crore), Sunny Deol's Gadar-2 (Rs 619 crore), and Prabhas' Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire (Rs 512 crore).
Interestingly, the top four films of 2023 are all original Hindi-language films. In comparison, South Indian films dominated the top ten list in 2022, with K.G.F. Chapter 2, RRR, and Kantara collecting Rs 970 crore, Rs 869 crore, and Rs 362 crore, respectively.
Salaar: Part 1—Ceasefire, Rajnikanth's Jailer, and Vijay's Leo were the three South Indian films that grossed more than Rs 400 crore at the Indian box office in 2023.
Ormax noted it sourced the box office data from credible industry sources, including producers, distributors, exhibitors, and trade analysts.

Content firm Banijay aims for Rs 1K cr in India revenue,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/content-firm-banijay-aims-for-rs-1k-cr-in-india-revenue/articleshow/106946287.cms,18-01-2024,"Content production company
Banijay Asia
, which also owns
Endemol
Shine India, is targeting total revenues of Rs 1,000 crore this financial year, a senior company executive said. This would make it one of the largest TV and streaming content production firms in India by revenue.
""We have to touch it, and we will get there,""
Deepak Dhar
, Group CEO of Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India told ET.
""One of my key focus areas is to ensure profitable growth across all the businesses,"" Dhar said, adding that the two companies produce high-quality content on tight budgets. ""We are seeing an upswing in content investments by broadcasters and streaming platforms,"" he noted.
Last year, Banijay took full control of Endemol Shine India by acquiring CA Media's 51% stake for $90-100 million. The two companies produce 85–90 scripted and unscripted shows across Hindi and regional languages a year, which is set to rise to 90–100 shows in 2024.
Dhar also said the content production space in India is ripe for consolidation. ""Acquisitions are going to be a big part of our thrust in India. We are looking at companies with complementary strengths and skillsets,"" he said, without elaborating.
Live Events
Dhar believes India has the potential to become a global content creation hub, with Banijay/Endemol vying for a leadership position in this area after producing the Chinese version of Big Brother in India a few years ago.
""We want to make India an outsourcing hub for content because we can produce content at price points that the world can't produce at,"" he said.
Meanwhile, a key focus area for the two companies will be to take the existing IPs like Bigg Boss, Fear Factor, and
MasterChef
to new regional markets on both TV and streaming, according to Dhar.
""We see growth opportunities on both linear TV and streaming,"" he said, adding that Banijay and Endemol work with all major platforms like Viacom18, Sony Pictures Networks India,
Zee Entertainment
, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video.
Apart from the returning seasons of existing shows like Bigg Boss, Fear Factor,
Temptation Island
, MasterChef, The Night Manager, and Dahan, the company will this year also produce new shows, including the Indian adaptation of Suits, The Good Wife Monk, and House.
Banijay has also ventured into the live entertainment business, with the opening ceremony of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 being its first project. It intends to create local IPs and bring international IPs to India in the live events space.
In terms of formats, sports will be a major focus. ""There will be a lot of sports content, sports-related IPs, and formats that you will see us create,"" he said.

Co-producer of film 'Animal' moves Delhi HC seeking stay on OTT release,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/co-producer-of-film-animal-moves-delhi-hc-seeking-stay-on-ott-release/articleshow/106871439.cms,15-01-2024,"Cine 1 Studios, a
co-producer
of Bollywood
film
'
Animal
', approached the
Delhi High Court
on Monday seeking a stay on its release on OTT platforms, digital streaming platforms and its satellite broadcast. The movie, directed by
Sandeep Reddy Vanga
, was released in theatres on December 1, 2023 and is set to be released on Over-The-Top (OTT) platform
Netflix
on January 26.
While Cine 1 Studios Pvt Ltd claimed a breach of agreement and said it was not paid a single penny, defendant and another co-producer
Super Cassettes Industries Pvt Ltd
contended Rs 2.6 crore was paid to the plaintiff which it did not disclose to the court.
Justice Sanjeev Narula perused the document placed by the defendant about a payment of Rs 2.6 crore to the plaintiff.
On being asked by the judge about the claimed payment, the counsel for Cine 1 Studios said he was not aware of it as the document was not brought to his notice. The lawyer said he will take his client's instructions and apprise the court.
The court was told the plaintiff's counsel will ensure the presence of the authorised signatory of Cine 1 Studios, Murad Khetani, before it on January 18, the next date of hearing.
Live Events
Senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, representing Cine 1 Studios, said the plaintiff did not get any information about the revenue the film earned, its collection at the box office, the music, satellite or internet rights.
""They (Super Cassettes) have been collecting all the money but I have not been paid a single penny... I have a long relationship with them but they have no respect for the agreement. I had the regard for the relationship and the sanctity of the contract, therefore, I did not rush to court,"" he submitted.
The plaint said the two production houses had entered into an agreement to produce the film. Under the agreement, Cine 1 claimed, it had a 35 per cent profit share and was entitled to 35 per cent intellectual property rights in the movie.
The plaint claimed without Cine 1's approval,
Super Cassettes
incurred expenses for making/ promoting/ releasing the film, received revenues from the box office sales but did not share the details with it. Super Cassettes also did not pay any money to the plaintiff despite the profit-share agreement. it claimed.
Senior advocate Amit Sibal, representing Super Cassettes, submitted the plaintiff invested no money in the film and all expenses were borne by his client.
Apprising the judge of a document signed between the parties, he contended the plaintiff concealed from the court that on August 2, 2022 it had given up all its intellectual property rights in the film.
""In the amended agreement, he (Cine 1) has deleted the clause where he got 35 per cent of intellectual property right in the film.... All this has been given up for consideration of Rs 2.6 crore for which he raised an invoice,"" Sibal said.
He said this critical and material information was concealed from the court.

"Ram temple coverage: DD to install about 40 cameras, do 4K live broadcast",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ram-temple-coverage-dd-to-install-about-40-cameras-do-4k-live-broadcast/articleshow/106816805.cms,13-01-2024,"Nearly 40
cameras
will be installed by
Doordarshan
at various locations in
Ayodhya
, including the new Ram temple complex, for live coverage of the consecration ceremony which will be broadcast in cutting-edge 4K technology, a top official has said. Besides the main temple premises, the national broadcaster will beam live visuals on different channels from Ram ki Paidi near Saryu ghat, Jatayu statue at Kuber Tila, among other locations.
""Like the G20...when we had done 4K transmission, this time also, Doordarshan will do it in 4K (broadcast technology).... The entire coverage will be live and broadcast in different languages, and on different channels. And, private channels will also get the feed via Doordarshan,"" Ministry of Information and Broadcasting secretary Apurva Chandra told.
The 4K technology offers a much higher number of pixels resulting in enhanced visual quality for viewers.
The 'pran pratishtha' of the Ram temple in Ayodhya will take place on January 22, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other dignitaries.
More than 7,000 guests have been invited by the Ram temple trust, including eminent personalities from various fields, and a large number of sadhus and seers from across the country.
Live Events
Ahead of the mega ceremony, the Uttar Pradesh government and the Ayodhya administration have pulled out all the stops and the holy city is getting decked up for the big day.
Chandra and the entire
DD
team which will be here on the day of the consecration ceremony visited Ayodhya earlier this week to take stock of preparations for the coverage.
""We are getting to see a lot enthusiasm here for the January 22 'pran pratishtha' ceremony. Doordarshan has done all the preparations for it. Around 250 staff from Doordarshan will be present (on that day),"" he said.
""About 40 live cameras will be set up in Ayodhya, at locations such as Ram ki Paidi, the temple complex, wherever the PM's events will be there. One programme he has at Jatayu (statue) also,"" he added.
The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra is gearing up for the ceremony and workers are racing to finish work for the ceremony at the temple complex.
The temple complex will be opened to people from January 23 onwards, and the city of Ayodhya will virtually be fortified on the day of the ceremony, so there is a greater anticipation among devotees to watch the live coverage of 'pran pratishtha' and other events on that day.
Ram temple trust general secretary Champat Rai earlier said that the 'pran pratishtha' at the temple will take place at 12:20 pm on January 22.
Rai late December had said that a statue of Jatayu had been installed on Kuber Tila in Ayodhya.
""An ancient Shiva temple that exists on the Kuber Tila has also been revitalised,"" he said.
The trust recently had unveiled photographs and videos of the new temple's illumination and of the huge statue of Jatayu.
Ahead of the ceremony on January 22, a large number of people gather at Ram ki Paidi to soak in the spirit of Ayodhya.
A special laser show runs regularly in the evening at Ram ki Paidi during which 3D projection is also done on old temples and buildings facing the water channel, telling the story of Lord Ram and others from the epic Ramayana.
An official source said Information and Broadcasting Ministry officials have had discussion with local and state administrations and on January 10 they checked a place in the city where a media centre could be set up for the large number of journalists arriving for the coverage of the consecration ceremony.

YouTube India did not respond to an email seeking their response to the letter and the FIR filed against their executives as of press time Thursday.
“CSAM and content harmful to children are prohibited for platforms to carry and government as a whole has a zero-tolerance approach to any violation of safety and trust obligations relating to CSAM and other prohibited content under IT rules 3(1)(b),” union minister of state for electronics and information technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar told ET.
On October 6 last year, the IT ministry had sent notices to social media platforms X (formerly Twitter), YouTube and Telegram, asking them to remove pornographic CSAM present on their platforms.
The notices were sent a day after ET reached out to senior officials in the ministry on the issue and sought their response to the presence of pornographic and CSAM material on these platforms.
NCPCR is a statutory government body tasked with the protection of child rights and other matters in the country.
The commission, in its statement, said it took suo-moto cognisance of some videos on YouTube and sent notices to state police departments across the country asking them to investigate the matter and book the people running these channels.
While Maharashtra is the first state to take such action, NCPRC said it expects “similar prompt response from the other states as well”.
In a meeting with representatives from social media and internet intermediaries on Thursday Chandrasekhar asked all companies to ensure no presence of any of the content prohibited under IT Rules, especially CSAM.

firm
Delta Corp
on Tuesday said the
GST demand
worth over Rs 23,200 crore is
arbitrary
and contrary to provisions of law and hence it has not made any provisions towards the same. The company, which is also a casino operator, reported a 59 per cent year-on-year decline in its
consolidated net profit
for the quarter ended December 2023 at Rs 34.48 crore. The income from operations stood at Rs 181.54 crore, 18 per cent lower than the year-ago period.
In a footnote alongside its Q3FY24 numbers, Delta Corp said that on September 27, 2023, the holding company and its two subsidiary companies received show cause notices from the
Directorate General of GST Intelligence
(DGGI), Hyderabad, for alleged short payment of
Goods and Services Tax
(GST) aggregating to Rs 16,822.9 crore for the period July 1, 2017, to March 31, 2022. On October 28, 2023, another subsidiary of the company received a GST show cause notice aggregating to Rs 6,384.32 crore for the period July 1, 2017, to November 30, 2022, from
DGGI
, Kolkata.
Delta Corp said the demands made by the authorities on the gross bet value/ gross face value as against gross gaming revenue/gross rake amount has been an industry issue and multiple representations have been made by the industry participants to the government in this regard.
""Holding company/ subsidiary companies have filed writ petitions and have obtained stay orders from respective High Courts. Without prejudice, the holding company and its three subsidiaries, based on legal assessment, are of the view that all the above notices and the tax demands are arbitrary in nature and contrary to the provisions of law,"" Delta Corp said in a regulatory filing.
The companies will pursue all the legal remedies available to them to challenge such tax demands and the related proceedings, it informed.
Live Events
Considering the fact that the holding and subsidiary companies have a good ground to defend against the said show cause notices, the group management believes that until the GST matter gets effectively concluded, ""no provision for impairment is currently required towards Goodwill and other assets related to the three subsidiaries, as reflected in the consolidated financial results"", it added.

Admitting that there is a segment of people who have moved from TV to OTT, the 62-year-old here talked about recognising the other available segments, like those who till now could not save enough money to buy a TV.
According to Nagpal, everytime a new technology comes in and makes itself available for a particular segment of customers, there is a segment -- that has always been there -- which can only afford the older technology.

""Now, if you say they'll bypass television and go straight to the mobile, but where will they afford the cost of the broadband and the content both. It is like saying 'if they can't eat the bread, why can't they eat the cake',"" he added.
There are still about ""110 million paying television customers"" in this country, who are paying no less than Rs 300 a month.
""And the number is not dropping,"" Nagpal, who has co-authored a case study on the subject of disruption, which is now part of the curriculum at the London Business School, added.
His debut book, containing a collection of 10 stories set in different countries, investigates the idea of adaptation, which, he said, was the one thing every business needs if it wishes to evolve.
""What stories do is open your mind to reading. If it is a preachy book nobody would read it, if it is a story book people will read it for fiction and in the process some learning also seeps in and settles in your mind somewhere. So that was my reason for going for a fictionalised version of the facts that I wanted to talk about,"" he said.
The book, priced at Rs 599, is available for purchase across online and offline stores.

Netflix was yet to comment on the report.
The company last year said it was not worried about ads and in-game payments.
""We want to have a differentiated gaming experience and part of that is giving game creators the ability to think about building games purely from the perspective of player enjoyment and not having to worry about other forms of monetization, whether it be ads or in-game payment,"" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters had said during the earnings call.
In August, Netflix rolled out its games across devices -- TVs, computers, and mobile -- and announced the first public tests of its cloud-streamed games.

"India's TV, digital video revenues are projected to reach $17 billion by 2028",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/indias-tv-digital-video-revenues-are-projected-to-reach-17-billion-by-2028/articleshow/106511662.cms,03-01-2024,"India's video market, including
TV
and digital, is predicted to grow to $17 billion by 2028, up from $13 billion in 2023, according to Media Partners Asia's Asia Pacific Video & Broadband Industry 2024 report.
The report offers a comprehensive guide on the adoption and monetisation of
TV channels
, including free TV and pay-TV, SVOD, premium AVOD, and UGC/Social Video advertising in 14 Asia Pacific markets.
In 2023, the report said the APAC video industry posted 5.5% growth, reaching $145 billion, primarily due to a 13% increase in online video sales to $57 billion. TV revenue rose less than 1% to $88 billion.
The largest video markets in 2023 were China ($64 billion), Japan ($32 billion), India ($13 billion), Korea ($12 billion), and Australia ($9.5 billion), it added.
Online SVOD grew 15% in 2023, reaching US$28 billion, while AVOD grew 11% to US$29 billion. UGC/social video dominates AVOD, with premium AVOD having a 20% share. Pay-TV subscription fees showed marginal growth in APAC, ex-China, with revenue declines in India and Japan.

MPA projections show APAC video industry revenues will grow at a CAGR of 2.6% between 2023–28, reaching US$165 billion by 2028, with China's matured market reaching US$70 billion by 2028.
It added that China will become more mature, growing at a 1.7% annual rate to reach US$70 billion by 2028, followed by Japan (US$35 billion), India (US$17 billion), Korea (US$14 billion), Australia (US$11 billion), and Indonesia (almost US$4 billion).
As per the report, the APAC online video sector is expected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR to reach US$78.5 billion by 2028, with marginally contracted TV industry revenues. Scaled TV markets like India, Japan, Korea, and Indonesia are expected to grow slower. There remain significant downside risks to TV advertising in Indonesia, India, and Korea.
Commenting on the findings of the report, MPA Managing and Executive Director Vivek Couto said: The Asia Pacific video industry continues to experience a secular shift from TV to online in terms of engagement and monetization. Improved connectivity, rising connected TV (CTV) penetration combined with the growth of local creator economies, investment in premium local content, and the wide availability of premium sports
streaming
will continue to drive dollars and eyeballs online.""
In 2023,
Amazon Prime Video
, ByteDance,
Disney
,
YouTube
, iQIYI, Meta,
Netflix
, and Tencent accounted for 65% of APAC online video revenue. Local players like Jio Cinema and Zee-Sony in India are competing successfully and have the potential to scale.
""Strategic and private equity investments in the online video sector in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia are enhancing local and regional companies' competitiveness. The online video sector is rationalizing with price increases, disciplined content, and marketing investment, ad tiers, new monetization strategies, and local market consolidation in Korea, Japan, and India,"" he added.
According to Couto, traditional linear TV faces pressure due to the shift to online and CTV growth, with some territories not expected to see a significant return on TV ad dollars.
He also stated that local broadcasters are leveraging premium AVOD and SVOD in Australia, India, Indonesia, and Japan without significantly disrupting pay-TV subscription revenue outside these markets.
""However, historically strong markets such as India and Korea are under pressure. Malaysia, the strongest pay-TV market in Southeast Asia, is experiencing a deeper contraction across the traditional pay-TV segment, partially offset by the growth of bundled broadband and IPTV. In Indonesia and Thailand, the online VOD opportunity is increasingly more attractive than pay-TV,"" he noted.

BARC
), India's sole
TV viewership
measurement body, has increased its
meter count
used for measuring viewership of
Indian TV audiences
to 59,000 and is on course to touch 65,000 in the near term, say sources privy to the development.
BARC has set a target of installing 65,000
Bar-O-meters
which are used to collect TV viewership data, and is adding new meters every month to achieve its target, one of the sources said.
The council had installed 55,000 bar-o-meters as of December 2022, in accordance with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's (MIB) policy guidelines for TV rating agencies in India.
The increase in meter count comes amid calls from various sections of the industry to increase the BARC
panel size
to capture precise TV viewership data from India's urban and rural areas.
Meterology Data, in which BARC owns 51% and TAM Media owns the remaining 49%, deploys and maintains the Bar-o-meters. It also has 2500 OOH meters to collect representative data from India's urban and rural areas.

The BAR-O-meters are used to collect real-time data beamed through GSM networks, which are supported by a network of field personnel, electronic equipment, and a strong IT backbone.
BARC is promoted by the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF), the Indian Society of Advertisers (ISA), and the Advertising Agencies Association of India (AAAI).
The IBDF holds a 60% stake in BARC, with the ISA and AAAI owning 20% each.
BARC's TV viewership data, which is based on a sample survey, is used as a currency for trading TV advertising worth Rs 40,000 crore annually.
Over 600 TV channels have currently signed up with BARC to have their viewership measured.
BARC refused to comment on the story.
BARC reported modest revenue growth of Rs 321 crore in FY23, as the TV industry experienced subdued ad revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year due to macroeconomic challenges.
Broadcasters account for over 75% of BARC's revenue, with agencies and advertisers accounting for the rest.
The council's net profit dropped 59% to Rs 36 crore due to increased investments in field-related activities.
BARC's expected cash accrual is expected to be Rs 35–40 crore per fiscal. The company had cash and cash equivalents of Rs 60.40 crore.
Meterology Data's FY23 revenue grew 39% to Rs 107 crore, while net profit rose 66% to Rs 5 crore.

Predictions for 2024: Devising new ways of narrating India story,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/predictions-for-2024-devising-new-ways-of-narrating-india-story/articleshow/106425928.cms,01-01-2024,"The year 2024 is set to be an extraordinary year for
media and entertainment
. Incredible stories from across India, connectivity and access like never before, innovation in filmmaking— there hasn’t been a more perfect time for storytellers and the audience.
Today, India stands only second to China in the volume of digital media consumption, as per the EY-Ficci 2023 report. Fans have never had more choice to enjoy great stories, whether that’s through the spike in smart TV penetration or the prevalence of fast, low-cost, internet-enabled devices.
Streaming services
are reaching a wide range of audiences, with
Netflix
leading a cultural exchange that is changing the way we engage with the world. An unforgettable reminder of this impact, for me, will always be from a few years ago, when I heard a familiar tune play out at a local pandal: it was Bella Ciao (from
Money Heist
) featuring dhol!
This truly is the golden era of entertainment — and I firmly believe streaming will accelerate towards
solidifying itself as the ubiquitous medium of
storytelling
. There are so many stories to be told, across languages and from every village, town and city of our vibrant country. 2023 showed us that a powerful story can come from anywhere, and excite audiences everywhere.
Live Events
The victory of
RRR
and The Elephant Whisperers at the Oscars, or Vir Das: Landing winning an International Emmy, are proof of this.
In 2024, I foresee a greater emphasis on programming that embraces the unique and the authentic. India
is a treasure trove of stories — and at Netflix, we are committed to celebrating it, across a variety of genres, with the best creators — from Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Yash Raj Films, Neeraj Pandey and Imtiaz Ali, to Abhishek Chaubey, Kanika Dhillon and Kapil Sharma.
It’s the classic thali — something for every taste and mood, and that’s what we want to serve to our members both in India and across the world.

"Pathaan helps Yash Raj Films post blockbuster Rs 1,508 crore top line",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pathaan-helps-yash-raj-films-post-blockbuster-rs-1508-crore-top-line/articleshow/106359220.cms,29-12-2023,"Mumbai: Film studio
Yash Raj Films
’ revenue for the fiscal ended March 31, 2023, surged almost 2.5 times on year to Rs 1,508 crore on the back of Shah Rukh Khan-starrer
Pathaan
’s superlative box office performance.
The company recorded revenues of Rs 619 crore in FY22, according to its regulatory filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).
“It’s been one of our best years in our 50-year history,” Akshaye Widhani, chief executive of Yash Raj Films (
YRF
), said about calendar 2023. “Our hits have been more than our misses due to our focused content approach,” he told ET, referring to the performances of Pathaan and Salman Star-starrer Tiger 3, which was released in November.
Widhani refused to comment on the financials since YRF is a privately held company.
Global box office collections of Pathaan, which made its theatrical debut on January 25, and Tiger 3 stood at Rs 1,100 crore and Rs 480 crore, respectively.
Live Events
Widhani said the five films in the YRF Spy Universe franchise have garnered close to Rs 3,000 crore at the global box office. The other three films in this franchise included Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai, and War (starring Hrithik Roshan as agent Kabir).
The company’s net profit for FY23 increased 10.3% to Rs 117 crore, while expenses zoomed over 2.8 times to Rs 1,375 crore, as per its RoC filing.
The surge in FY23 revenue and profit is despite the underperformance of
Ranveer Singh
’s Jayeshbhai Jordar, Akshay Kumar’s Samrat Prithviraj, and Ranbir Kapoor’s Shamshera last fiscal.
Widhani said the Indian film industry has bounced back in 2023 with the highest-ever box office collections and the addition of a record 250 movie screens. “The outlook for 2024 and thereafter is very positive,” he added.
Fiscal year 2023 also marked YRF’s foray into streaming with the launch of the docuseries The Romantics on Netflix. The company this year produced a four-part thriller series, The
Railway Men
, which was released in November.
Widhani said YRF is working on multiple projects with Netflix as part of a wider creative partnership between the two companies.
In 2024, the company will have three new projects for Netflix, including a web series titled Mandala Murders and the direct-to-digital films Vijay 69 and Maharaja.
“The partnership with Netflix will allow YRF to tell stories to new audiences and allow them to consume Indian stories in their languages too,” Widhani said, noting that The Railway Men was among the Top 10 trending on Netflix.
As of date, YRF does not have any theatrical releases scheduled for 2024, as it is still working on its future film slate. It has started filming War 2, the sixth movie in the YRF Spy Universe franchise, which will be released in 2025.
“We are getting ready to lock the rest of the slate and put our films on the floors. We are taking our time on future film slates since audience tastes have also changed post-pandemic,” Widhani said, adding that the focus is on quality rather than quantity.
Yfx Studios, the visual effects arm of YRF, is expanding its facility to cater to the rise in VFX-related work.
""Our films are getting bigger. We are getting bigger. So YFX primarily caters to YRF. We built a visual effects studio to cater to YRF's growing appetite for visual effects,"" Widhani added.
Widhani said YRF has adopted a tech-first approach to filmmaking. ""We are experimenting with virtual production, which is going to be a big enabler for content production going ahead,"" he noted.
YRF Talent, the company's talent management division, is looking to expand its roster, which currently includes Rani Mukerji, Anushka Sharma, Arjun Kapoor, Vaani Kapoor, Ayushmann Khurrana, Bhumi Pednekar, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Aadar Jain, Anya Singh, Manushi Chillar, Shalini Pandey, Sharvari, and Vishal Jethwa.
""YRF has always believed in creating a brand right from scratch, which is why our pool of talent is always distinct and it carves a unique niche for itself.
We will expand and continue to grow our talent,"" the YRF CEO said.
Widhani said the film industry will grow in tandem with the broader media and entertainment industry as the Indian economy expands and people's disposable income increases.
""As disposable income goes up, the willingness to spend on entertainment will go up. Overall, not only films, but I think the entire media and entertainment industry in India is going to see rapid growth,"" he noted.

PVR INOX
managing director, can be heard crooning a song in ""Dunki"". Bijli started with covers of the songs that he likes in English and Hindi during the COVID-19 pandemic.
He then decided to take things to the next level by singing an original track and it resulted in ""Waheguru, Ik Onkar"", a spiritual number that features prominently in
Shah Rukh Khan
's new release ""Dunki"" and is also available on T-series as a music video.
""It is a passion project and I hope that when people listen to the song, it helps them. I am not a religious guru or anything. I am just singing a song that resonated with me. It's a prayer and has different meanings and interpretations for different people. I hope it touches people's hearts,"" Bijli told PTI in an interview.
Shot in the scenic Pathar Sahib Gurudwara near Leh, Ladakh, the video is directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra with Sheykhar Ravjiani attached as the composer and Ravi Verman as the cinematographer.
Bijli, who is a regular with his 'riyaz' (practice) and has been taking music lessons from a guru, said he always had a love for singing.

""I have been very fond of music right from the beginning. I had a band in college called Modus Operandi but in 1988 when I finished college, the band also finished because I started work in my transport company and then my love for cinema started in 1990,"" he said.
His family had a transport business and owned Vasant Vihar's
Priya
Cinema, which Bijli later expanded into a multiplex chain called PVR. The company recently completed its merger with INOX and is now known as PVR INOX.
Bijli, who now has a new band called Random Order, said the spiritual song is his first official release. He wanted to begin his musical journey by remembering god through a track that also connects him to his roots as a Punjabi.
""My mother really likes the song and I also wanted to give a tribute to her through this,"" he added.
Once he decided to record the song, Bijli approached Ravjiani as he had liked the composer's rendition of ""Hanuman Chalisa"".
""I reached out to him and said, 'Shekhar, can you do a favour for me. Can you do an original rendition of 'Ik Onkar'. And he said, 'Okay, I will do it for you'. He did it for free without charging. I love the music he created, the loop of 'Waheguru'.""
Bijli thought he will shoot the music video at the iconic Golden Temple in Amritsar or Delhi's Bangla Sahib Gurudwara. But Mehra suggested that they shoot the video at Pathar Sahib Gurudwara near Leh, Ladakh.
It was just a coincidence that the song became a part of ""Dunki"", directed by Rajkumar Hirani.
Shah Rukh Khan, his friend from school days, was discussing the film with him when Bijli realised that the song could find a place in the movie that's set in Punjab.
""I spoke to Raju and said, 'Listen, I have sung this rendition of 'Ik Onkar' and I believe the movie is set in Punjab and there is some gurudwara scene'.' He said, 'Yes, we have such scenes'. I said, 'Can I just send you my song'. He said, 'Yes, send it and I will see if I can fit it anywhere. But I have to like it and it has to resonate and go with the overall theme'. I said, 'Yes of course, I am just taking a chance'.""
Luckily, Hirani liked the song and decided to include it in the film's background and also made it a part of the official album.
Post ""Waheguru, Ik Onkar"", Bijli plans to share his music with the public through songs on the theme of hope.
""I am approaching music directors whose music I like. I like Amit Trivedi's music a lot, so I reached out to him a few months ago and I asked if I could do some songs. I explained to him that I am 56 years old and can't do frivolous stuff.
""It has to be fun and positive because Covid was a time when everybody got very depressed. So I want songs of hope that bring a smile,"" Bijli said, adding that his aim is to create songs that have ""depth and longevity"".
Trivedi has written two songs that have been penned by Swanand Kirkire and Bijli plans to record it soon.
Bijli is happy that music has become a part of his life once again after so many years.
""Life comes full circle. Of course, my first job as the MD of
PVR INOX
is to run the company, I have a responsibility towards the shareholders and 25,000 people who work in PVR and 200 million visitors. But when people ask me, 'How do you get the time?' I always tell them that there are businessmen who play golf or tennis. They pursue other passions of riding or driving. This is my passion.""

ICC extends multi-million dollar sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola
ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said: “We are delighted to announce the record-breaking viewership and engagement numbers for the Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023, making it the biggest World Cup ever. The incredible numbers continue to show the increased appetite for ICC events across the world and the consumption of innovative and engaging content that fans can enjoy.”
The viewership numbers are staggering across territories, most notably in host country India, where it became the most watched Cricket World Cup ever, with 422 billion viewing minutes on the Disney Star Network alone, resulting in a whopping 54% increase from 2011 and a significant 9% rise from 2019.
The tournament was the most broadcast in India, with about five times more hours of coverage compared to 2011, thanks to the 22 channels that showcased the tournament across nine different languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam).
The female viewership share rose from 32% for the 2011 edition of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup to 34% this year, reflecting the universal excitement surrounding the country’s home tournament. The final between the hosts and Australia became the most-watched Men’s Cricket World Cup match ever, with a peak TV audience of 130 million and a total of 300 million people watching it on the Disney Star network on linear alone in India.

The 2023 edition was also the most broadcast tournament in the United Kingdom and Australia and saw huge jumps in viewership compared to 2011 when it was played in the same time zone.
The UK saw 800 hours of live coverage and 5.86 billion minutes (of live viewing compared to 4.74 billion minutes) in 2011, a 24% increase. In Australia, there were 602 hours of live coverage with 3.79 billion minutes of live viewing, 92% more than the 1.98 billion minutes recorded in 2011.
Coupled with Australia’s success, this led to a significant increase in the overall audience, with 9.1 million people watching India in 2023 compared to the 2019 edition in England and Wales, which saw 6.1 million tune-ins.
Pakistan saw record viewership with 237.10 billion viewing minutes of live viewing. The corresponding figures were 230.49 billion minutes in 2019 and 220.63 billion minutes in 2011.

The 2023 edition was the most shown World Cup in South Africa and saw a 32% increase in viewership from 2019, with 5.01 billion minutes of live coverage watched.
Similar was the case in the United States, where 395 hours of live coverage made it the most broadcast Cricket World Cup, with coverage hours rising 14% from 2019. The final was the most-watched match with 48 million live viewing minutes, 47% more than the second most watched (India vs. Pakistan). Nine of the 10 most-watched games in the US featured India.
The decision to make coverage freely available for mobile users via Disney+ Hotstar in India led to a whopping 295 million LIVE Tournament viewers tuning in. Across the event, there were five world records broken on Disney+ Hotstar for digital peak concurrency, with the final attracting cricket’s highest concurrent audience ever, having already made history at four other 2023 World Cup matches, demonstrating the appeal of cricket and the excitement the ODI format continues to offer:
More records were broken on ICC platforms, with this World Cup becoming the most digitally engaged ever with an astonishing 16.9 billion video views, a 158% increase from the previous record set at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 in Australia. Engagements on ICC social channels also saw a massive increase, with a record 1.23 billion, an increase of 142% from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 and 155% from the 2019 edition in England and Wales.
These numbers reflected the ICC’s commitment to bring fans closer to the event no matter where they were in the world, whether it was showcasing India through the ‘It Takes One Day’ preview shows or going behind the scenes with teams after huge match wins like Australia’s victory in the final (19 million video plays on Instagram) or Afghanistan’s upset of Pakistan.
Having some fun and reimagining Glenn Maxwell’s cramp-afflicted heroics after his undefeated double-century against Afghanistan also had a major audience impact, with 50 million video plays on Instagram.
Host nation hero Virat Kohli’s Player of the Tournament feats created huge engagement, including a hug with his idol Sachin Tendulkar, attracting 40 million video plays on Instagram after breaking his ODI centuries record (78 million video plays on Instagram) to his World Cup wicket with the ball (39 million video plays on Instagram).
The ICC’s partnership with Meta, which included the Meta Creator Squad India collaborating with players ahead of the event and the launch of the Meta Super 50 creators that shared their behind-the-scenes mobile view of matches through the tournament, also contributed to the various digital records broken and helped cricket reach new audience cohorts. Princy Parikh’s translation skit with Kane Willamson (128 million video plays on Instagram) was the most-watched piece of the entire event, which saw a total of 16.3 billion video plays across Meta channels (9.7 billion on Facebook and 6.6 billion on Instagram).

Top European opera productions available for rental and purchase on Amazon Prime video,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/top-european-opera-productions-available-for-rental-and-purchase-on-amazon-prime-video/articleshow/106274193.cms,26-12-2023,"Enjoying
opera
- fully staged opera - at home has become easier. Recent productions from top
European
houses have begun to appear for rental and purchase on
Amazon Prime Video
.
So, on an impulse, you can take in these works - and keep them, too. (There are other opera-focused streaming platforms, but those rarely allow for purchases.) The productions include rarely staged gems, and feature some of the boldest directors and greatest vocal talents today. Here are five recent additions.
'Fidelio'
Tobias Kratzer
is a director who is willing to jerk a canonical text around to fit a contemporary concept. In his take on Ludwig van Beethoven's ""Fidelio,"" for the Royal Opera in London in 2020, he upends both acts: The first takes place in a Jacobin milieu, amid the French Revolution; the second, however, departs from historical specificity, showing its chorus in modern dress. This approach fits an opera that has always proved a challenge for straightforward storytelling. Crucially, Kratzer's direction of singing actors tends to be marvelous; Star soprano Lise Davidsen is truly gripping as Leonore.
'Der Schatzgraber'
Live Events
Franz Schreker's music goes almost entirely unplayed in American concert halls and theaters. When it is programmed, you can often tell that it has been produced on the smallest of budgets. That's too bad, because this early 20th century composer's
music dramas
are wild delights. At the hinge of late Romanticism and early modernism, they're also unabashedly sensual. Music by Schreker, whose father was Jewish, was popular in German houses during the 1920s, but banned by the Nazis after 1933.
""For him, eroticism is like a way of escaping from the dilemma of societal failure,"" says director
Christof Loy
, who piloted this staging for the Deutsche Oper in Berlin last year. As with his recent presentation of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's ""Das Wunder der Heliane,"" the production is spare; he often lets singers do the storytelling. And this cast handles Schreker's lushly complex and demanding idiom with aplomb.
'La Perichole'
French operetta master Jacques Offenbach is also too infrequently heard in American houses. But he is reliably served on video. Some of Laurent Pelly's stagings remain in print, and Barrie Kosky's enjoyably deranged take on ""Orphee aux Enfers"" at the Salzburg Festival is on Blu-ray - but, unfortunately, not on streaming platforms.
This composer's works can be plenty manic even without a modern gloss or a metatheatrical concept. This Opera Comique performance of ""La Perichole"" from last year offers vividly colorful stage pictures, but within a presentation that mostly reflects the period of the piece's 1874 revision. Director Valerie Lesort steers a strong cast; Stephanie d'Oustrac and Philippe Talbot are stellar as the songful yet destitute lovebirds at the center of the plot. And, with its comic slant on the injustice of imprisonment, ""La Perichole"" makes for a refreshing tonic after ""Fidelio.""
'La Morte d'Orfeo'
When Pierre Audi was the artistic leader of the Dutch National Opera, he knew how to throw a festival bash. In 2018, I saw his staging of Stefano Landi's ""La Morte d'Orfeo"" (1619) - which extends the tale Claudio Monteverdi told in ""L'Orfeo"" - during the Opera Forward Festival in Amsterdam.
On a recent rewatch, I was delighted to find that this staging still works plenty well. The lightly surreal set design is in line with the abstraction that Audi has brought to Arnold Schoenberg's ""Gurre-Lieder"" and Olivier Messiaen's ""Saint Francois d'Assise."" But Audi's designs in ""La Morte"" have a glam quality. That's fitting, given the sumptuous allure of this early Baroque music, which receives a fine reading at the hands of Les Talens Lyriques and conductor Christophe Rousset. The cast is great, too, particularly mezzo-soprano Cecilia Molinari in multiple roles.
'Der Zwerg'
OK, one more from Kratzer. This production was for the Deutsche Oper in 2019, with the company's orchestra led by Donald Runnicles. Alexander von Zemlinsky is another early 20th century composer who could use more fans, and his one-act drama ""Der Zwerg"" - about a dwarf (a dual role for actor Mick Morris Mehnert and tenor David Butt Philip) whose romantic hopes are exploited by a superficial court culture - is given wrenching life by
Kratzer
and his creative team.

OML, which started as an artist management company, has over the years pivoted to content production in a big way, even as it strengthens its position in the artist management and branded content segments.
In the last few years, the company has exited non-core businesses like online ticket sales and live events to focus on the three verticals.
In 2021, the company sold its live events and IP business, comprising properties like NH7 Weekender, to Nazara-backed Nodwin Gaming for Rs 73 crore.
Before that, it had sold a majority stake in its online ticketing and events platform, Insider, for over Rs 35 crore.
OML's investors include CA Media and BCCL, the publisher of The Economic Times, who hold 41.06% and 27.53%, respectively. OML promoters Vijay Nair, Ajay Nair, and Samira Kanwar have a little over 29%.
The digital entertainment company has morphed into a content powerhouse with over 500 hours of original content under its belt. It has worked with platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar. Its talent roster comprises 90+ artists, including names like Tanmay Bhat, Zakir Khan, Australian chef Sarah Todd, and creator Dr Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju.
Apart from growing its existing businesses, the company is focusing on building its social media prediction engine hypothesis, which helps brands and agencies get maximum return on investment from their influencer marketing campaigns.

"Films, web series should be made responsibly; people know what to watch: Prakash Jha",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/films-web-series-should-be-made-responsibly-people-know-what-to-watch-prakash-jha/articleshow/106149336.cms,20-12-2023,"Guwahati, Stating that the
society
is ""far stronger"" than a few individuals who certify movies, filmmaker
Prakash Jha
on Wednesday denounced
censorship
of movies or web shows but said these should be made ""responsibly"". In an interview with PTI here, the acclaimed director stressed that the
freedom
to tell a story is available in both mainstream theatres and OTT (over-the-top), but it has to be made in an ""engaging manner"" for people to watch.
""I have never ever supported censorship. Because societies are far stronger than a bunch of individuals who decide as to what the society has to watch,"" he added.
Without naming any, Jha said contents showing violence or sex are being watched by the public in cinema halls even though those are duly certified.
""The society goes and makes those films successful. Now, why don't you censor the society? Put a censor on the society, can you do that? So, the society will decide as to what it wants to see. And I agree with that,"" he said.
Asked if OTTs give more freedom in making a film on a contentious subject as it does not face any physical attack like those exhibited in cinema halls, Jha said one can take freedom in every possible manner or in any medium.

""But you have to communicate responsibly, because you are communicating with people and there is a certain amount of civility or responsibility which is connected with the communication of the medium.
""I believe in that, and that is why I try and negotiate my stories in a (particular) manner. Whether I am telling it for cinema or OTT, I would like to speak responsibly,"" he added.
The
National Award
winning filmmaker further said that for him, making movies is like telling stories which deal with human societies and people, and such sensitive subjects have to be told responsibly.
""As far as the medium is concerned, whether it is movies or OTTs, actually it is (just) storytelling. So, you have to tell engaging stories, you have to let the characters speak what they need to speak. For me, it is the same -- whether I make movies or those get exhibited on OTTs,"" he added.
The only difference between products for OTTs and theatres is that there is an expansion of storytelling in the digital format, Jha said.
""You have characters of every sub-plot and stories of every character. Whereas in movies, you have to speak about the main story and wind it in two to two-and-half hours. That's the only difference. Otherwise, there is no difference in scale or telling the story whatsoever,"" he added.
The director, who has been making films for over three decades and has now ventured into OTTs as well, also said that times change, societies change and so the manner of speaking stories change, but the stories remain the same.
""I am not a historian, I don't observe like that. I am only interested in telling stories and I work very hard to assimilate the stories that I want to say.
""I am sure that there must be changes happening around but that's left to you guys (media), to critics and observers to comment on that. I am not really an authority,"" he said when asked about the changing landscape of Bollywood.

No Sony nod yet to extend Zee merger date,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/no-sony-nod-yet-to-extend-zee-merger-date/articleshow/106137904.cms,20-12-2023,"The Sony-Zee mega
merger
still hangs in the balance.
Sony Pictures Networks
India (SPNI) said it hasn’t yet decided on extending the Thursday, December 21, deadline to complete the merger with
Zee Entertainment
Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL). The Punit Goenka-led
Zee
had asked for an extension on December 17.
In a statement, the
Sony
Group Corporation-owned company said it looks forward to hearing ZEEL’s proposals and how it plans to meet the remaining key conditions.
“Zee’s notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India dated December 17 is an acknowledgement that they will not be able to meet the December 21, 2023, deadline to close the SPNI/ZEE merger,” the SPNI statement read.
It added that the ZEEL notice triggers an existing contractual provision in the deal that allows for both parties to discuss the possibility of extending the deadline.
“SPNI is required to start those conversations but has not yet agreed to a deadline extension. We look forward to hearing Zee’s proposals and how they plan to complete the remaining critical closing conditions,” the company said.

On December 17, ZEEL asked SPNI and Bangla Entertainment, which is owned by SPNI, to extend the date for concluding their merger. ZEEL disclosed this in a regulatory filing on Sunday.
Shafaq Uraizee Sapre, Mumbai Managing Partner of law firm Chandhiok and Mahajan, said that the parties would have to consider the terms of the Merger Cooperation Agreement dated December 22, 2021, before considering any changes to the merger plans. All options would have to be carefully evaluated and typically withdrawals of any merger of such magnitude and nature are only opted for by parties if there are issues that cannot be resolved.
“The parties are conscious of the terms of their merger agreement, regulatory steps and approvals taken for the merger, sentiments of the stakeholders involved and the positions of the parties at the time of pre-merger stage negotiations. In the current scenario, these aspects would need to be carefully examined for any events that would be triggered if there is an extension of the merger date or if the merger does not take place and parties are generally wary of such triggers,” said Uraizee.
“While Zee's request for an extension would have to be considered by Sony in terms of their agreement, with the imminent December 20, the parties would have to act fast. The current issue, in our view, is not of the nature that cannot be resolved by mutual agreement between the parties and thus may not lead to any withdrawal of the merger. Generally, even the consideration of an extension of timelines indicates a positive move signalling that the parties are still committed to fulfilling their obligations under their merger agreement and completing the merger,” she adds further.
A senior lawyer said the Sony-Zee deal will not collapse if the two parties are unable to complete the merger by the December 21 deadline.
“The long-stop date is usually a placeholder to get the parties to complete their intended acts within that time,” said the lawyer, who didn’t want to be named. “Unless provided in the contract to be of essence to the agreement, it usually doesn’t have that level of importance. In the present circumstance, where the matter has moved on from just contractual stipulations to statutory approvals, the importance of adherence to such a date is even more diminished.”
ZEEL has been actively engaged with Sony to complete the necessary Conditions Precedent (CPs) as per the Composite Scheme of Arrangement, said a person aware of the process.
“Most of the CPs have already been closed,” the person said. “Certain CPs are operational in nature and are set to be completed closer to merger completion. There are some that have external dependencies, though the required formalities and submissions are completed and both companies are awaiting clearances.”
Media analyst Karan Taurani said Sony has put the onus of completing the deal on Zee by asking it to meet the remaining terms.
“The likelihood of the deal getting called off is low because both parties are very much invested in the deal, as the deal is equally important for both to scale up in the M&E (media end entertainment) ecosystem, which could see further disruption on the back of a potential RIL-Disney merger,” he said.
Taurani said the merger may go ahead without Punit Goenka as MD and CEO of the merged entity, as he may not want to jeopardise shareholder interest. Besides, Sony may not agree on him becoming boss of the merged company unless a favourable outcome emerges from the ongoing Securities Exchange Board of India (
Sebi
) investigation into him.
The
Sony-Zee merger
has received all key approvals, including that of the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal and the stock exchanges.
However, differences between Sony and Zee over the proposed appointment of Goenka as the merged entity’s MD and CEO have delayed the merger.
As reported first by ET, Sony is not keen on him heading the merged entity due to the Sebi probe. Sony is pushing for the appointment of SPNI MD and CEO NP Singh as CEO of the new entity.
Goenka has said the merger scheme that was agreed between the two parties should be implemented in its original form.
“From our perspective, we are committed to ensuring that all points in the Composite Scheme of Arrangement are duly addressed,” Goenka had said during Zee’s earnings call on November 9. “We recognise the value that this merger holds, and our focus remains on unlocking this opportunity for all the shareholders.”
As per the merger scheme agreed between the two, Goenka was to serve as MD and CEO of Sony-Zee for a period of five years from the effective date, subject to terms and conditions.
Sony and Zee signed a merger agreement in December 2021. It was anticipated to conclude in eight to 10 months. In May, Sony chairman and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said the merger would conclude by September 30. That deadline was breached due to the legal cases filed by lenders against ZEEL.
If completed, the merger will lead to the creation of a multibillion-dollar media powerhouse with a leading position in TV, OTT and content creation. FY23 financials show that ZEEL and Sony's combined revenue was almost Rs 15,000 crore.
If the merger happens, Sony will indirectly own 50.86% of the new company, while other ZEEL shareholders will hold a 45.15% stake and the ZEEL founders would have 3.99%. The merged entity will get a fund infusion of $1.5 billion from Sony.

It’s a wrap! A look at Bollywood’s year of comebacks and India’s 2023 cinematic odyssey,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/its-a-wrap-a-look-at-bollywoods-year-of-comebacks-and-indias-2023-cinematic-odyssey/articleshow/106124664.cms,19-12-2023,"In the whirlwind of 2023, the entertainment landscape in India underwent a seismic transformation, evolving into a realm of unparalleled experiences and emotions.
The year unfolded as a spectacle for cinephiles, leaving them thrilled as Bollywood's King Khan made a triumphant return to the silver screen after nearly five years. Adding to the nostalgia, the iconic Sunny Deol also marked his comeback with the much-anticipated Gadar 2.
As we bid farewell to 2023, it becomes indisputable that this year has been a crescendo in the symphony of curated entertainment. The curtain falls on an extraordinary chapter where the Indian audience not only embraced the familiar silver screen but also ventured into uncharted territories of live entertainment, exploring the vast and diverse world of cinema.
According to BookMyShow's comprehensive year-end wrap, titled 'Best of 2023 - #EntertainmentOnASpree,' the live entertainment industry experienced a significant boost. The year commenced with the inaugural edition of Lollapalooza India, marking the onset of a live entertainment renaissance. Over 13.5 million enthusiasts seized the opportunity to partake in on-ground events, heralding a revolution in India's live entertainment scene. The appetite for specially curated international events surged by an impressive 82%, accompanied by a remarkable 2.3x growth in BookMyShow (BMS) Live's consumer cohort.
Skyrocketing box-office collections, again
Live Events
In a staggering display of cinematic prowess, the box office receipts for the first nine months of 2023 skyrocketed to a monumental Rs 8,798 crore, Ormax Media in its October report had stated. This exceptional figure not only surpasses the gross box-office collection of Rs 10,637 crore in 2022 but has also set the stage for a historic milestone.
In October 2023, Ormax predicted that 2023 is poised to be the highest-grossing year ever, with the potential to breach the Rs 12,000-crore threshold, fueled by the releases of blockbusters like Tiger 3, and upcoming
Salaar
and
Dunki
.
The momentum is undeniable, with the gross box-office collection in the first nine months of 2023 hitting 6% higher than the same period in the previous year. This robust performance signifies the resilience and enduring appeal of Bollywood on the big screen.
Leading the charge in this cinematic resurgence is Shah Rukh Khan's magnum. Jawan, and Pathan stand among the most successful films of the year with earnings soaring to Rs 733 crore and Rs 646 crore, respectively. Gadar 2 also secured its place among the elite, grossing above Rs 500 crore with receipts totaling Rs 614 crore.
Noteworthy contributions come from Jailer and Adipurush, collecting Rs 397 crore and Rs 331 crore, respectively, adding substantial figures to the burgeoning box-office numbers.
This year's cinematic journey saw January and June contribute significantly to the rising tide of box-office collections, with figures standing at Rs 1,388 crore and Rs 1,073 crore, respectively. As the year hurtles towards its conclusion, Bollywood's financial success not only reflects the resilience of the industry but also hints at a future where the allure of the silver screen remains unwavering.
Multilingual melange
In recent years, Indian cinema has witnessed a delightful shift with the inclusion of South Indian stars in Bollywood. Actors like Prabhas, Rajinikanth, and Vijay have garnered significant fan followings across the country.
This inclusion has brought a refreshing multilingual flavor to the Indian film industry. South Indian actors are now not only celebrated for their action-packed roles but are also given lead roles in Bollywood movies.
The trend reflects the audience's growing inclination and appreciation for their work, showing that good cinema transcends regional boundaries. ""35 per cent of respondents, language or genre is not a deciding factor at all, when it comes to choosing a premium format of watching a movie on the large screen. It is solely based on the movie and its content,"" BMS reported in October.
Resilient passion for cinema
What keeps the love for cinema alive and thriving in India? It's more than just entertainment; it's an emotional connection. The silver screen provides an escape from the complexities of life. It's a place to disconnect from reality and become fully engrossed in the stories, the characters, and the magic of cinema.
The audience, especially the younger generations like Gen Z and Millennials, find solace in the immersive experience offered by movie theaters. They relish the larger-than-life visuals and the exceptional audio quality that only the big screen can provide.
According to the BMS survey, 74 per cent of the respondents liked to keep an eye out for movies that resonate with them and plan ahead at least 3 days in advance, while 26 per cent prefer to catch a movie spontaneously.
In fact, 35 per cent in the GenZ generation prefer to watch the first day first show of a movie, the report added.
Global recognition and travel boost
India secured its place on the global live entertainment map, welcoming sensations like Lollapalooza India 2023, Trevor Noah, Daniel Sloss, Backstreet Boys, Westlife, Jay Shetty, and MotoGP.
Live events became integral to travel itineraries, with 411,002 enthusiasts traveling outside their home cities for unforgettable experiences. Tier II towns, including Lucknow, Bhubaneswar, and Nagpur, witnessed a remarkable 225% growth in ticket sales, showcasing the nation's hunger for diverse live entertainment.
Entertainment beyond metros
Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Chennai led the charge in both movies and live entertainment, consistently topping the charts. However, 2023 witnessed non-metros and tier 2 cities emerging as significant consumers of entertainment, with Ahmedabad retaining its legendary status in the non-metro market.
The year encapsulates the year's entertainment trends across movies, live events, and on-demand content. The year 2023 was not just about entertainment; it was a celebration of diverse experiences that resonated with audiences nationwide.

Awaiting ZEE's proposals on completing remaining critical closing conditions of merger: Sony,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/awaiting-zees-proposals-on-completing-remaining-closing-conditions-of-merger-sony/articleshow/106111546.cms,19-12-2023,"Sony
Pictures Networks India (SPNI) has said that it has not yet agreed to extend the deadline to complete the merger deal with
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
Limited (ZEEL).
In a statement, the company said it looks forward to hearing ZEE’s proposals and how they plan to complete the remaining critical closing conditions.
“ZEE’s notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India dated December 17 is an acknowledgement that they will not be able to meet the December 21, 2023 deadline to close the SPNI/ZEE merger,"" the SPNI statement reads.
It added that the notice triggers an existing contractual provision in the deal that allows for both parties to discuss the possibility of extending the deadline.
""SPNI is required to start those conversations but has not yet agreed to a deadline extension. We look forward to hearing ZEE’s proposals and how they plan to complete the remaining critical closing conditions,” SPNI said.
Live Events
On December 17, ZEEL requested Sony Group companies to extend the date for concluding their merger as the December 21 cut-off date looms large.
In a regulatory filing on Sunday, ZEEL said it has requested Sony Group Corporation-owned Culver Max Entertainment Pvt Ltd (CMEPL) and Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd (BEPL) “to extend the date required to make the scheme effective as per the terms of the merger cooperation agreement” dated December 22, 2021.
However, the extension of the December 21 deadline has to be taken jointly by the two companies.
The Sony-Zee merger has received all the key approvals, including from the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal, and the stock exchanges.
However, differences between Sony and
Zee
over the proposed appointment of Punit Goenka as the merged entity’s MD and CEO have delayed the merger.
As reported first by ET, Sony has told Goenka that he can’t be the MD & CEO of the proposed entity since he continues to be under the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) investigation for alleged misappropriation of funds.
Sony is pushing for the appointment of its long-time India executive NP Singh as CEO of the new entity.
Sony and Zee signed a merger agreement in December 2021. The deal was anticipated to conclude in 8 to 10 months; however, two years down the line, it is yet to be completed due to the cases filed by financial institutions against ZEEL and the Sebi order against the company’s promoters.
Once completed, the merger will lead to the creation of a multibillion-dollar media powerhouse with a leading position in TV, OTT, and content creation. The FY23 financials show that ZEEL and Sony's combined revenue was almost Rs 15,000 crore.
After the merger, Sony would indirectly own 50.86% of the new company, while other ZEEL shareholders would hold a 45.15 percent stake and the ZEEL founders would hold 3.99%. The merged entity will get a fund infusion of $1.5 billion from Sony.

Adesh Kumar Gupta to quit ZEEL as director,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/adesh-kumar-gupta-to-quit-from-zeel-as-director/articleshow/105999189.cms,18-12-2023,"Adesh Kumar Gupta
has decided to quit as the non-executive, non-independent director of entertainment giant
Zee
Entertainment Enterprises Limited (
ZEEL
) ahead of the company's annual general meeting (AGM) on December 16.
In a stock market filing, the company said it had received a letter from Gupta informing it of his intention not to continue as a director of the company after the AGM.
ZEEL added that Gupta will cease to be a member of the Audit Committee and the chairman of the Risk Management Committee and Stakeholders Relationship Committee of the board after the AGM.
The ordinary resolution to appoint a director in place of Adesh Kumar Gupta, Non-Executive Director, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offered himself for re-appointment, became infructuous due to his withdrawal from getting reappointed.
""I have communicated from time to time that owing to personal reasons and commitment, I regret that I will not be able to continue as the director of the company after the ensuing Annual general Meeting (AGM),"" Gupta said in a letter to the ZEEL board.
Live Events
ZEEL's FY23 annual report states that one of the ordinary businesses that will be transacted at the AGM is to appoint a director in place of Gupta, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for re-appointment.
""Accordingly, I withdraw my re-appointment as director of the company at the AGM,"" Gupta said, adding, ""I wish a great success to the company and hope the pending merger with Sony will be completed at earliest. I thank the board for continuous support during my tenure as director.""
Incidentally, Gupta was also part of the Special Merger Implementation Committee, which also includes Punit Goenka, Managing Director & CEO; Mukund Galgali, Chief Commercial & Strategic Initiatives; and Vikas Somani, Head - M&A and Business Development.
This committee was formed to oversee various aspects of the Sony-Zee merger.
Interestingly enough, ZEEL's FY23 annual report states that one of the ordinary businesses that will be transacted at the AGM is to appoint a director in place of Gupta, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for re-appointment. The company made its annual report available to the public on November 24.
Gupta, who is a Chartered Accountant by profession, has over 40 years of experience in areas including corporate strategy, M&A, business restructuring, fund-raising, and taxation.
He held various senior positions, including board positions, in multiple companies, including Indian Rayon, Birla Global Finance, Aditya Birla Nuvo, and Grasim Industries.
Gupta has been working as an insolvency professional after retiring from his position as a full-time director and CFO of Grasim Industries.
He presently serves on the boards of Grasim Industries, Vinati Organics, India Pesticides, Care Ratings, and Krsnaa Diagnostics, among other companies.
The share price of ZEEL ended 2.06% lower at Rs 278.25 at the close of the market today.
The development comes at a time when there is uncertainty over ZEEL's proposed merger with Sony-owned Culver Max Entertainment. The cut-off date for completing the multi-billion-dollar merger deal is December 20.
Disagreements have emerged between Sony and Zee regarding the CEO of the combined business since Punit Goenka, the proposed MD & CEO, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for alleged financial irregularities.

The meeting being planned is for agreeing on a ""broad roadmap"" going ahead and ""not for signing"" a deal, said the first source.
The second source said the meeting would aim to discuss the contours of the transaction and it was not yet certain if any documents between the two sides would be signed. The person added the final plan for the meeting was still being worked out.
Ambani's Reliance runs many TV channels and the JioCinema streaming app through its media and entertainment unit Viacom18. Ambani has been locked in a fierce battle with Disney by offering free streaming of the Indian Premier League cricket tournament, whose digital rights were once with Disney in India.

The multi-billion-dollar transaction, as
Bloomberg
reported in October, is illustrative of Ambani’s deep ambitions in the media and entertainment sector of the world’s most-populous country that’s already lured global giants like
Netflix Inc.
and Amazon Prime.
Reliance scooped up the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League for $2.7 billion in 2022 and bagged a multi-year pact in April to broadcast Warner Bros Discovery Inc.’s HBO shows in India.
For Disney, it’s a way to limit exposure in a fiercely competitive market where its subscriber numbers are sliding, while still keeping a foothold in India.
“We have an opportunity to strengthen our hand,” Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive officer, said in a Nov.8 earnings call with that analysts, adding that the company was considering its options in India. “We also are looking to see whether we can strengthen our hand, obviously, improve the bottom line.”

US video game developer Riot Games to debut international esports tournament in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/us-video-game-developer-riot-games-to-debut-international-esports-tournament-in-india/articleshow/105927861.cms,12-12-2023,"American
video game developer
and publisher
Riot Games
is hosting its debut international
esports tournament
in India and doubling down its investments to strengthen the grassroots ecosystem for its first-person shooter (FPS) games in India.
“The ‘Convergence’ IP was created specifically with the Indian audience in mind. We wanted the Indian VALORANT fan to experience the thrill of an international tournament and it is, in reality, a thank you message to the Indian gaming community,” Sukamal Pegu,
esports
lead - India and South Asia at Riot Games told ET.
“Since the launch of VALORANT in 2020, India has become one the biggest regions for the game in the APAC region. And to further accelerate our momentum here, we have a busy roster for experiences and events planned in 2024 as well as a couple of exciting announcements,” he added.
Convergence will be held between 14-17 December at the Manpho Convention Centre, Bengaluru.

“It will also have a special focus around the esport ecosystem and build collaboration with esport organisations, tournament organisers, brands and athletes to work towards a common goal of profitability and sustainability,” he added.
VALORANT is among the top 10 PC online video games in India which gained popularity during the nine months after the banning of Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) in India in 2021.
Riot has since installed its servers in India for better gaming experience, launched an Indian in-game character called ‘Harbour’, and also featured an Indian map in the game. However, given that it is a PC game, it is an expensive affair for an average gamer in India.
Riot had also announced that the mobile version of the game is under development, which many industry insiders believe may be launched towards the end of 2024.
As per industry estimates, the game has close to 300,000-500,000 players in India and makes revenue from in-app purchases. Global Esports (GE) is the only Indian organisation which has an official VALORANT team in partnership with Riot for their VALORANT Champions Tour (VCT).
“Globally, Riot Games has shared $33 million from sale of digital assets to its partner teams and we are proud to say that the Indian team has been a beneficiary of $1 million,” said Rushindra Sinha, CEO and founder of GE. “This is over and above the
$50,000
base salaries that we pay to our players annually.”
On the other side, Riot has been constantly criticized by the esports industry for its poor treatment of third-party organisations and their whole ecosystem being unprofitable.
On Wednesday, Jai Shah, founder of Orangutan Gaming posted on X that the organisation is quitting the Valorant SA roster as the PC ecosystem is not sustainable in India.
“High salaries, lack of LAN tournaments, most of the big orgs disbanding, low social media numbers of the athletes, and most importantly viewership at an all-time low which makes it really difficult to provide value to everyone investing in the scene,” he said in the post.
Kartik Sabherwal, founder, and CEO of Upthrust Esports also posted about the publisher limiting the ecosystem by putting licensing restrictions on third party organisers.
However, Riot’s Pegu said, “As a publisher, we have an important role to play in the ecosystem’s efforts towards sustainability and we will always accept that responsibility. In the end, we are answerable to our Indian fans and as Riot, we shall never compromise in the quality of experience that we bring to the fans”.

"RIL, Disney ready term sheet to merge India operations",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ril-disney-ready-term-sheet-to-merge-india-operations/articleshow/105916032.cms,12-12-2023,"Mumbai:
Reliance Industries
Ltd (
RIL
) and Walt
Disney
Co. are finalising details of a non-binding term sheet to move ahead with plans to merge their India media and entertainment operations, said executives involved in the matter. The deal is likely to give the Mukesh Ambani-led group a controlling stake in what will become the country’s largest media and entertainment business if the deal goes through.
The plan, as of now, is to create a step-down subsidiary of RIL’s
Viacom18
, which will absorb Star India via a stock swap, said the people cited above. Reliance is pitching to be the larger shareholder with at least 51% in the merged company with Disney owning the residual 49%, they said. Both businesses are being treated as similar-sized ones, so RIL is likely to pay cash for the controlling stake.
The two sides are also negotiating a business plan to inject cash as immediate capital investment, expected to be $1-1.5 billion. The final shareholding structure of the entity will get crystallised and its value established based on the cash infusion from each of the parties.
The board is expected to have equal representation from Reliance and Disney of at least two directors each. Uday Shankar-led
Bodhi Tree
, the second largest shareholder in Viacom18 after Reliance with a 15.97% stake, is likely to get a seat. A minimum of two independent directors are being considered. This may change in the weeks ahead, said the people cited above.

Those involved in the talks from the US company include Justin Warbrooke, CFO, direct-to-consumer business, and international head of business operations, and Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive brought back in July by chief executive Bob Iger as an adviser to help him navigate the company’s legacy television business and the ESPN sports network. Another participant is K Madhavan, Disney’s India head, along with The Raine Group, an advisory, said the people cited above. Warbrooke was in India recently.
Manoj Modi, Ambani’s key adviser, is fronting negotiations for RIL, with the group’s M&A team.
The two sides are likely to have key meetings before signing the term sheet, following which both are expected to go for an accelerated timeline to announce the merger, possibly as early as end-January, said the people cited above.
After the term sheet is decided and confirmatory due diligence is conducted, the valuation exercise will officially begin with independent valuers.
“It’s a merger not an acquisition but not with equal shareholding,” said one of the persons cited above. “Both sides will put equity instead of one buying the other out for cash. Even the junior shareholder will have rights.”
Reliance Industries spokesperson did not respond to ET's detailed questionnaire sent on Monday afternoon till press time. Walt Disney India declined to comment.
The US company is also expected to provide the joint venture company a five-year licence for exclusive subscription video on demand (SVOD) content for Disney+ originals and its library content.
A five-year lock-in, except in the case of an IPO of the merged company, is also expected to be agreed upon. Distribution channels and Jio Platforms are also to be made available to the joint venture on mutually agreed terms. A list of competitors with which any engagement is to be barred will be drawn up.
Upon signing the term sheet, there is likely to be a 45-60 day exclusivity that can be mutually extended.
Walt Disney CEO Iger said on an earnings call in November that the company was “considering options” but that it would like to stay on in India and try and “strengthen our hand, improve the bottom line”.
As per US media sector analysts at Barclays, one way to manage Disney’s cost base without standalone cuts could be to extract synergies out of transactions with other companies.
This could be “a significant immediate opportunity in the company’s largest international segment, Star India. This business appears to be running at breakeven ebitda on ~$2 billion of annual revenues because of factors unique to the market”, said Kannan Venkateshwar and Siyuan Huang in their recent report. “The company would benefit significantly if it is able to combine Star with Reliance Jio’s local media business... This could result in significant cost and revenue synergies and could transform the value of this business longer term.”
Viacom18, which also has TV18 and Paramount as shareholders, saw its FY23 net profit slump 98% to Rs 11 crore while revenue from operations rose 10% to Rs 4,554 crore. The company's expenses increased 33% to Rs 4,586 crore.
Walt Disney-owned Star India's consolidated net profit for FY23 dropped 31% to Rs 1,272 crore from Rs 1,834 crore in the previous fiscal year, according to its filing with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). While the company's operating revenue from the TV and digital businesses rose 6% to Rs 19,857 crore, total income increased 9% to Rs 20,699 crore, making it the largest traditional media and entertainment company in the country by revenue.
Novi Digital Entertainment, the subsidiary that owns Disney+ Hotstar, has seen its net loss more than double to Rs 748 crore, while revenue rose 35% to Rs 4,341 crore. Novi is in the process of merging with its parent company, Star, which holds a 78.07% stake in it.

India's government blocked 174 betting and gambling sites,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/indias-government-blocked-174-betting-and-gambling-sites/articleshow/105902632.cms,11-12-2023,"The centre has blocked a total of 581 applications (App) so far out of which there are 174 betting and gambling applications (apps) and 87 loan lending applications. Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary told parliament.
“Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) blocked a total of 581 applications under section 69A of IT Act, 2000 which includes 174 betting and gambling related applications, 87 loan lending applications and other applications including gaming applications like PUBG, GArena Free Fire etc,” Chaudhary told in a reply to Lok Sabha.
The illegal betting and gambling app has been in the spotlight recently with MeitY last month issuing a blocking order against some 22 'illegal' betting apps and websites, including Mahadev Apps.
The order was issued upon a request by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) which was investigating an alleged money laundering syndicate.
The government in February had blocked 138 such illegal betting and gaming websites, however some of them were still operating.

In July the Centre had amended and notified the IGST Act which mandates that all offshore gaming companies need to be registered in India. It also gives the central government power to block websites which are not registered and are violating laws.
In October, The Economic Times had reported that the government found as many as 114 illegal betting and gambling platforms operating in India through domain farming.
These platforms were collecting UPI payments through proxy bank accounts and the amount accumulated in proxy accounts is being remitted through hawala, crypto and other illegal routes.
Later the matter was flagged once again in a presentation to the revenue department last week by domestic online gaming companies.
They had also shared the modus operandi of how several offshore betting and gambling platforms were managing to illegally operate in India.
Some prominent platforms operating illegally are Parimatch, Fairplay, 1XBET,
Lotus365
, Dafabet, and Betwaysatta. Many of these are on the banned list. Some of the sites are already being probed by the ED.
Last week, in a reply to a Lok Sabha question, the minister of state had told parliament that no offshore companies have so far registered after October 1.

has expressed admiration for the teaser of the upcoming aerial action thriller film 'Fighter,' starring
Hrithik Roshan
and
Deepika Padukone
. Scheduled for release on January 25, the film's teaser was unveiled on Friday. Shah Rukh Khan, responding to Hrithik's post on X (formerly Twitter), lauded the cast and director Siddharth Anand.
He wrote, ""The only thing that can be more beautiful than @iHrithik @deepikapadukone @AnilKapoor is the way @justSidAnand presents his films. Looking so good all round and finally Sid has developed a sense of humour....'you must be joking' bro!! All the best to everyone. Ready for take off!""
Siddharth Anand had helmed SRK's superhit movie 'Pathaan'.
The 1 minute 14-second teaser, directed by Siddharth Anand, showcases Hrithik Roshan as Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania, Deepika Padukone as Squadron Leader Minal Rathore, and Anil Kapoor as Group Captain Rakesh Jai Singh, all fighting for the country. The aerial stunts and high-flying action scenes are prominently featured in the teaser, with the film reportedly shot at Indian air bases using real Sukhoi jets and Indian fighter planes.
'Fighter' marks Deepika Padukone's first collaboration with Hrithik Roshan. The motion poster released on Independence Day 2023 provided the first glimpse of the actors portraying Indian Air Force officers in the movie.

ET Explainer: GTA VI - What is driving the craze around GTA games?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/et-explainer-gta-vi-what-is-driving-the-craze-around-gta-games/articleshow/105804148.cms,07-12-2023,"Can a video game due to release almost two years from now already create a buzz unlike anything seen before in the gaming community? It can if the game is one from the
Grand Theft Auto
franchise, arguably one of the most popular and influential video-game franchises of all time. The trailer for the sixth instalment in the GTA franchise released early Tuesday morning has already garnered more than 115 million views on YouTube at the time of writing this piece. The 1:31 minute trailer has all the elements that make the franchise so popular — A realistic open world, often based on real cities in America, with the option to either embrace total anarchy or be a good Samaritan, replete with satirical characters and crime. Lots of crime.
The series has been around since the late 1990s, driving frequent visits to neighbourhood cyber cafes in the early 2000s. The game is a pioneer in open-world game play, immersing players into a world where they can be anybody without facing the consequences. Not that the GTA games are the only games to offer such chaotic freedom, but several factors have made them the most popular of them all. Subhrojit Mallick explains the reasons behind the craze.
A platform to play out deep, dark desires
A look at social media is enough to tell us the extent people are willing to go to behave badly in a virtual world. In simple terms, the GTA games provide a platform to players to play out their deep, dark desires of maybe torching a group of people with a flamethrower in an amusing and light-hearted manner, and most importantly, without consequence.
For 25 years, the game has given players the freedom to don up as a hardened criminal in dystopian America replete with all its excesses and hedonism. Players can wander around stealing cars, beating people, picking fights with the police, with the game designed in a way that such acts feel par for the course for the character in the times they live in.

A fair share of criticism
It is also for this reason that the game has borne the brunt of criticism around violence in video games, going to the extent of being banned in countries like Thailand. The game’s publisher, Take Two Interactive, has faced multiple lawsuits each time a new title was released, as well as the ire of anti-video-game activists for its depiction of violence and allegedly promoting violence against ethnic communities.
The game has also fuelled the omnipresent fear that such video games lead to real-world crime. Tesla boss and X owner Elon Musk said he was unable to finish GTA 5 because “he didn’t like doing crime”. “GTA 5 required shooting police officers in an opening scene. Just couldn’t do it,” he said.
As a result, most GTA games have been rated Mature (M) by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), the body behind assigning age and content ratings to consumer video games in US and Canada.
A violent gift that keeps on giving
The formula helped Rockstar sell north of 405 million copies worldwide across all platforms including consoles, PC, and mobile devices so far in the franchise, with a bulk of sales coming from the fifth instalment in the series which has an online mode. It is this online mode, called GTA Online, that continues to be the money-spinner for the game studio and even a decade after its release, GTA V continues to be one of the top games on gaming platforms in terms of active user counts.
The India connection
GTA’s online mode has the option to set up one’s own server which houses one’s own world where one can become any character and role-play with other players in the community. It’s essentially an early version of the metaverse, where a virtual world becomes a platform to mingle with other players, complete missions, and live a virtual life. One can earn virtual money and spend it in-game in clothes, cars and real estate.
Such unbridled freedom has given rise to a culture of video-game streamers setting up worlds of their own, attracting thousands of viewers who tune in just to see their shenanigans. There are well over 1,000 such streamers in India who regularly stream GTA Online for viewers. Indian content creators such as ‘S8UL’, winners of the ‘Content Creator of the Year’ award in the Global Esports Awards 2023, joined forces with Velocity Gaming to create a star-studded roleplay server in GTA, garnering thousands of views in their livestreams. Another streamer, ‘Dynamo Gaming who also runs his own server, has nearly 10 million subscribers tuning in to watch him live his life in the virtual world with his friends.
“We have a huge base for RP-games in India. A lot of Indian servers are there that attract a lot of audience. GTA is big in India. Even till now they still enjoy playing the story mode of older GTA games. Those are some epic stories that people love to watch streamers play out,” said Aditya Sawant aka Dynamo Gaming.

Twelve multi-system operators (MSOs) and one headend in the sky (HITS) operator held more than a million subscribers. Together, these 13 platforms have 43.9 million subscribers.
The number of MSOs that have permission from the information and broadcasting ministry to provide digital cable TV services has fallen to 1,737 from 1,748.
In a recent statement, the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (
IBDF
) said there has been a 7% viewership growth in pay TV homes, with 5.8 million households transitioning from free-to-air to pay.
""The impressive rise in television viewership underscores India as one of the few international markets witnessing consistent television growth, despite digital media's rapid expansion,"" said IBDF president K Madhavan.
While the number of TV channels permitted by the ministry remained unchanged at 903, the number of pay channels increased to 360 from 358 in the previous quarter. The total number of free-to-air channels stood at 532, down two from 534 in the previous quarter.
Among the 360 pay channels, there are 256 standard definition (SD) and 104 high definition (HD) pay TV channels.
According to the TRAI data, 58 SD pay TV channels are priced under Re 1. Almost 97 SD and 13 HD pay TV channels are priced between Rs 1 and Rs 5, and the price of 47 SD and 25 HD pay TV channels ranges from Rs 5-12. There are about 37 SD and 52 HD pay TV channels priced at Rs 19, with only two channels priced higher than Rs 19.
Among the 360 pay TV channels, 114 are general entertainment channels, while 71 are movie channels. There are 62 news and current affairs channels that are paid.

"Online gaming funding falls from Rs 12,740 cr in FY22 to Rs 835 cr in FY24",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/online-gaming-space-witnesses-fall-in-funding/articleshow/105763016.cms,06-12-2023,"Funding in the
online gaming industry
has slumped to Rs 835 crore in this financial year so far from a high of Rs 12,740 crore in FY22 due to global macroeconomic headwinds, according to a report by EY.
The report titled 'New frontiers: Navigating the evolving landscape for
online gaming
in India' attributes interest rate hikes, tightened liquidity, inflation, changes in taxation, and concerns about an imminent recession as some of the reasons for the drop in investments in the online
gaming
segment.
The industry, which comprises about 1,400 startups, attracted funding of Rs 22,931 crore from both domestic and global investors between FY20 and FY24 so far.
This year’s funding is even lower than the Rs 921 crore raised by online gaming companies in FY20 but more than the Rs 796 crore raised in FY23. Fundraising stood at Rs 7,639 crore in FY21.
The number of deals in the segment also fell sharply from 72 in FY22 to 15 in this fiscal so far. In FY23, the segment saw a mere 33 funding deals being closed.
Live Events
Indian Real Money Gaming (RMG) companies garnered Rs 19,897 crore in funding between FY19 and FY24 till date.
While noting that the last two to three years have seen the inception of numerous gaming startups, the rise of three gaming unicorns, more than six strategic exits, and a successful IPO, the report added that the ongoing year has been challenging for the online gaming segment.
Despite the challenges, the report projects the Indian online gaming segment to post a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% to touch a market value of Rs 33,243 crore in FY28 from Rs 16,428 crore in FY23.
The report noted that the contribution of RMG platforms to the overall online gaming segment market size is expected to shrink to 75.4% in FY28 from 82.8% currently due to the recent GST amendments and accompanying notices to companies.
On the other hand, the contribution of non-RMG and
esports
platforms to the overall online gaming segment is expected to grow from 17% in FY24 to 25% in FY28.
The report noted that the GST collection from the RMG segment was Rs 1,700 crore in FY23. However, it added that the industry believes that it will grow at a staggering rate of 113% CAGR from the FY23 base to reach Rs 75,000–76,000 crore by FY28 due to the new GST rate and valuation mechanism provided by the government.
Furthermore, the sector is poised to contribute Rs 6,500–6,800 crore as direct tax revenues between FY24 and FY28. The enterprise value of the RMG segment stands at Rs 1.6 lakh crore, the report said.
India, with its 425 million gamers, had the second-largest number of online gamers in FY23, which is second only to China’s 750 million gamers. The report projects the Indian gamer base to reach 53.8 crore, registering a CAGR of 5%.
Currently, the share of paying gamers in the overall gamer base is 25%, which is expected to reach 34% in FY28. Almost 65-70% of online gamers are below the age of 34, the report noted.

Tiger 3 OTT Release Date: Here is likely OTT release date and where to watch  online,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tiger-3-ott-release-date-salman-khan-katrina-kaif-movie/articleshow/105746815.cms,05-12-2023,"After crossing the Rs 450-crore milestone at the global box office,
Salman Khan
starrer '
Tiger 3
' is likely to be released on a OTT platform soon. Directed by Maneesh Sharma and produced by Yash Raj Films, the movie delves into the high-stakes world of espionage and international intrigue. Shah Rukh Khan makes a special appearance, adding to the star-studded cast, with Emraan Hashmi taking on the role of the main antagonist.
The third installment of the Tiger franchise has captured the audience's attention worldwide. The latest buzz surrounding the film indicates a shift from the silver screen to the digital realm, as 'Tiger 3' is reportedly set to premiere on Amazon Prime on December 12th. However, there is no official confirmation about the same.
'Tiger 3' marks the third collaboration between Salman Khan and
Katrina Kaif
, bringing their on-screen chemistry to the forefront once again.
The film's success is underscored by its impressive global earnings, crossing the Rs 450-crore mark. According to the makers, 'Tiger 3' is poised to join the esteemed Rs 500 crore club globally. The storyline picks up after the events of 'Tiger Zinda Hai,' 'War,' and 'Pathaan,' weaving a narrative that places the characters Tiger and Zoya in a precarious situation. Falsely accused of treason by a former ISI agent named Aatish Rehman, they embark on a daring mission to clear their names.
The film was released in November 2023, coinciding with Diwali, and garnered mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. While praised for its gripping action sequences, technical prowess, and standout performances by Katrina Kaif and Emraan Hashmi, some critics voiced concerns about the plot, soundtrack, and pacing.

Indian music industry
generated ₹12,000 crore in revenue last year involving more than 40,000 music creators, says an EY report titled 'The music creator economy: The

He added that music publishing revenues remain much smaller, given the differing views on its applicability, litigation, and low awareness.
Of the ₹845 crore revenue earned in 2022-23, almost ₹525 crore of the music publishing revenue came from the Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS), which pays royalties to music creators by collecting licence fees on their behalf from music users.
About ₹320 crore of music publishing revenue was earned by the music publishers directly.
""The IPRS has over 13,500 authors as its members and continues to grow its revenues as more music users comply with publishing requirements,"" Pherwani noted.
According to the report,
Indian songs
are among the most popular in the world, holding seven spots on the Top Ten YouTube Global Charts for 2022.
The Indian music market is highly inclined towards film music, with 70% of music consumption and 75-80% of recorded music revenue being driven by film music.
While India's music business is governed primarily by the Copyright Act, divergent court decisions have resulted in differing viewpoints on its applicability and/or its quantum, the report stated.
This divergence in implementation, it added, has resulted in low compliance with the Copyright Act.

Netflix builds a ‘Squid Game’ universe as it awaits a second season,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/netflix-builds-a-squid-game-universe-as-it-awaits-a-second-season/articleshow/105684646.cms,02-12-2023,"Los Angeles: On the same soundstage where Bob Barker lorded over “The Price Is Right,” “Squid Game” is coming to life.
On Wednesday,
Netflix
will unveil its latest live experience, based on the dystopian hit show in which desperate South Koreans competed in a brutal contest of simple schoolyard games for a prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million). Winners moved closer to the money. Losers died. The live attraction mimics both the popular iconography of the series — the massive piggy bank filled with cash, a giant animatronic doll named
Young-hee
, the sterile white dormitory — and the childish games.
For $30, fans of “Squid Game” will compete in some 70 minutes of play, with moral twists and turns and six group activities, including the schoolyard race Red Light, Green Light and a nonlethal version of the series’s terrifying
Glass Bridge
challenge, which forced contestants to choose between two clear squares for each step across a bridge. If they chose incorrectly, they descended hundreds of feet to their death.
To feel even more like a character on the show, customers can buy a tracksuit for $50 and wear it during the experience. There is also a $100 VIP ticket option: In a nod to the original, you can watch the unfortunate masses compete in the games while you sip cocktails in a swanky lounge.
“It’s all the fun without the death,” said Greg Lombardo, Netflix’s head of live experiences.

Netflix plans to expand the live experience into other cities, but no additional locations have been confirmed. It’s one of several “Squid Game” adaptations that Netflix has planned in the hope of keeping viewers engaged during the long gap between the show’s first season, which debuted in September 2021, and its second, which is filming in South Korea and will come out next year.
One is an unscripted Englishlanguage competition show, “Squid Game: The Challenge.” Its first five episodes debuted Nov. 22, and a second batch became available Wednesday; the final episode will arrive next Wednesday.
Also coming soon is a video game in which players will be able to compete with characters from the series. A virtual reality game is already available, and in Brazil, Burger King has been offering “Squid Game”-themed food combos in four cities. (Care for an umbrellashaped onion ring to go with that shake?)
The brand offshoots follow a formula that Netflix has employed successfully for other popular shows, like “Bridgerton” and “Stranger Things.” A “Stranger Things” play that the streaming service helped develop will open in London’s West End on Dec. 14.
The expansion of intellectual property like the “Squid Game” brand, however, is getting more scrutiny in Hollywood. In recent years, the closest an entertainment studio could get to a sure thing was a franchise spun from a popular piece of intellectual property: A film begets a sequel begets a theme park ride begets a line of consumer products. Now a certain amount of audience fatigue has set in.
Marvel films like “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and “The Marvels” struggled at the box office. The recent Harry Potter spinoff, “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,” and the DC Comics film “The Flash” also underperformed. The industry has been forced to ask: What deserves franchise-building attention, and when is it too much?
“I’d say in general when you have IP, if you just do too much of something, that can dilute what it is,” Netflix’s chief content officer, Bela Bajaria, said in an interview. “The other thing we look at is, are you being true to the DNA of the show and why people loved it but expanding that connection?”
The reasons that Netflix is trying to expand “Squid Game” are obvious. Not only is it the most-watched show on the platform, but unsanctioned merchandise from the game, including tracksuits and Young-hee dolls, began selling almost immediately after its debut. Netflix now works with two global partners to meet the demand for the green athletic wear, especially around Halloween.
Influencers have also capitalized on the show’s popularity. Last year, YouTube star
MrBeast
enlisted 456 contestants to compete for $456,000 by playing tug of war and Red Light, Green Light. The video of the content generated 112 million views in the first five days online.
With that kind of interest in an outside version of a real-life “Squid Game,” Netflix decided the time was right to try to capitalize with a reality show of its own, but in English, so as not to confuse audiences.
lish, so as not to confuse audiences. “I was very curious how people would react to those games, the situations, the moral dilemmas,” said Minyoung Kim, Netflix’s head of Asian content, who was responsible for bringing the South Korean show to the service.
Still, some question whether a reality show based on South Korean filmmaker Hwang Dong-hyuk’s bleak view of his country’s class struggles and the global inequities of modern-day capitalism should exist at all.
While “Squid Game: The Challenge” debuted at the top of Netflix’s English-language TV list with 20.1 million views, reviews of the reality series have been scathing. Most criticized the season for missing the broader critique of capitalist culture that is at the heart of the nihilistic series.
“I see it obviously as an attempt to expand and monetize a franchise, but it seems particularly absurd given the anti-capitalist message of the show,” said Miranda Banks, chair of Loyola Marymount University’s film, television and media studies department.
“‘
Squid Game
’ was a South Korean series, and it’s inflected with the politics of South Korean culture,” she added. “So part of this is not just a translation of the genre, but it’s also a translation of a nation. And in doing that, it is not surprising — and it’s arguably quite hilarious — that it becomes a pro-capitalist dream fulfilled.”
The producers of the reality show are aware of the irony. But they said that by hewing as close to the original as possible — the same number of contestants (456) and a lifechanging amount of prize money ($4.56 million) — they felt they could create compelling television despite the lower stakes.
“This was a drama that was so much about the fact that people who were eliminated were killed,” producer Stephen Lambert said. “We were obviously never going to do that, but having such a big prize pot meant that when you were eliminated, your dreams died, and they were really big dreams that people had.”
(The filming of the reality show has generated its own drama, with complaints from several contestants about “inhumane” conditions. When asked about the complaints, the producers said in a statement that they “take the welfare of our contestants extremely seriously.”)
Still, does allowing fans to play along with a social satire cheapen its integrity?
Banks doesn’t believe so.
“I think that you probably have the fans who are there for the social commentary and the drama and the state of the game,” she said. “And then you have the people who love to play games. That might be different age groups. It might be different demographics.”
For Marian Lee, Netflix’s chief marketing officer, the brand offshoots are doing their job — bringing renewed attention to “Squid Game” — yet she acknowledges the risks of creating so many versions that relied on the same source.
“We have a hugely popular show that basically captures the cultural zeitgeist, but the doll, all the iconography, is carried through to the unscripted,” she said. “For us as a marketing team, how do you make sure that people understand that this is an unscripted version of that, and not the second season yet? You have to make sure that fans are following along: Oh, this is the unscripted version. Oh, this is the live experience. Oh, Season Two is coming.
“The fandom is there,” she added. “It’s just making sure that we’re able to create distinct moments for each of those things.

PVR Inox sees a strong Q4 on big-ticket movie releases,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pvr-inox-sees-a-strong-q4-on-big-ticket-movie-releases/articleshow/105636213.cms,04-12-2023,"PVR Inox
expects a strong fiscal fourth quarter for cinema exhibitors, driven by a strong lineup of movie releases, following a lacklustre third quarter marred by disappointing Hindi film performances and the ICC Men's Cricket
World Cup
.
""Q4 will be better than Q3, which is very skewed towards Animal,
Salaar
, and Dunki. In Q4, we will have films coming out every two weeks, and they're nicely spread out,"" PVR Inox executive director
Sanjeev Bijli
told ET.
A slew of films are set to be released between January and March 2024, including
Hrithik Roshan
's Fighter, Vijay Sethupathi's Merry Christmas, and
Kareena Kapoor Khan
's The Buckingham Murders.
While Q3 failed to meet the company's expectations, it expects an improved performance in December due to Ranbir Kapoor's Animal, Shah Rukh Khan's Dunki, Prabhas' Salaar, and Vickey Kaushal's Sam Bahadur.
""Q3 was somewhat muted as October and November did get impacted by the World Cup. However, I am confident of December since the World Cup is over and there is good buzz around Animal, Dunki, Salaar, and Sam Bahadur,"" he added.
Live Events
While the Cricket World Cup did impact the footfalls at multiplexes, Bijli said Akshay Kumar's Mission Raniganj and Tiger Shroff's Ganapath were underwhelming at the box office, while Salman Khan's Tiger 3 could mop up only Rs 250–275 crore against an expectation of Rs 450–500 crore.
Bijli noted that the screening of World Cup matches and singer Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour did well for the company, with the latter grossing Rs 6 crore in a month.
Meanwhile, the company has opened a new six-screen luxury property in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex, featuring the Insignia area with 2 screens and the Galleria area with 1 IMAX screen with laser technology and 3 premiere screens.
While PVR Inox plans to open 130–140 screens in FY24, it will open more luxury-format properties in cities like Mumbai, Pune, and Bengaluru. Around 5% of its more than 1700 screens are in luxury formats.
Bijli said the average ticket price (ATP) and spend per head (SPH) have already surpassed pre-pandemic levels. ""Admission numbers are taking time to go up, but some quarters like Q2 are phenomenal, and there are some muted months. It's only a matter of time before the admissions come back to normal,"" he added.
He also noted that the company will relaunch its movie subscription service Passport in a new avatar in January. ""We might reduce the price from Rs 699 per month currently and launch it across India, including South India,"" he added.
Bijli said the company indicatively plans to close 60 screens in FY24 and has already shut 33 screens so far. ""There are three big reasons why we are looking to close properties. One reason is that the mall is dilapidated. Second, the property is consistently making a loss. Thirdly, we have a new property in the same catchment area.""

PVR Inox says it will open 150 screens next fiscal with Rs 500 cr investment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pvr-inox-says-it-will-open-150-screens-next-fiscal-with-rs-500-cr-investment/articleshow/105629622.cms,30-11-2023,"The country's largest
multiplex
operator
PVR Inox
will open 150 screens in the next fiscal with an investment of about Rs 500 crore, a top company official has said. The company, which opened a six-screen luxury cinema at
Maison Inox
here on Thursday, already runs 118 screens across 23 properties in the
megapolis
.
Overall, including its property in
Colombo
, it operates 1,711 screens at 359 properties across 114 cities.
We are planning to add 150 more screens at an investment of around Rs 500 crore next fiscal, Sanjeev Kumar Bijli, an Executive Director at PVR Inox, told PTI here.
On the Maison Inox, he said normally a screen required an investment of Rs 5 crore but given that it's a luxury collection and comes with the first attached bar (Gastby Bar), the per screen cost is about Rs 7 crore.
On the company's overseas expansion plans, he said they will have more screens in Sri Lanka only and not anywhere else.

on Wednesday called the news report captioned “Sony-Zee Merger Risks Collapse Over Eleventh-Hour CEO Drama: Report” ""factually
incorrect
."" The report was published by
NDTV
.
""We wish to reiterate that the Company is continuing to work towards a successful closure of the proposed merger as per the Composite Scheme of Arrangement approved by the Hon’ble NCLT, Mumbai Bench,"" said the company in a statement.
Bloomberg had reported that Zee is insisting that its Chief Executive Officer Punit Goenka - also its founder's son - will helm the new entity, as agreed in the pact signed in 2021, while
Sony
is wary of his appointment given a regulatory probe against Goenka, the people added.
""This has created an eleventh-hour tussle in the two-year-old merger plan that has already seen a fair share of drama and delays,"" said the report.
A Zee representative, without commenting on the leadership issue, said in an emailed response that the company was “actively engaged” toward the timely completion of all prerequisites for the deal, according to the report. Zee had already completed most of them and was in touch with Sony “on a regular basis,” he said.

Tribunal sets aside 'fraudulent' transfer of Smaaash brand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tribunal-sets-aside-fraudulent-transfer-of-smaaash-brand/articleshow/105572375.cms,29-11-2023,"The Mumbai bench of the
NCLT
has annulled the change of ownership of the “SMAAASH” brand calling it a “fraudulent” transaction by promoter Shripal Morakhia and directed that it be transferred back to the insolvent Smaash Entertainment Pvt Ltd (
SEPL
) in what could enhance value for the debt laden sports entertainment company that owes creditors led by Edelweiss ARC Rs 452 crore.
In its judgement, the NCLT said Morakhia colluded with his associates to siphon off a “critical and valuable” asset of the debt laden company through an assignment agreement signed in 2022 which substantially reduced the financial proposal offered by prospective bidders for the company. It has directed
Fun Gateway Arena
Pvt Ltd (FGAPL) to return all the benefits earned by it on account of usage of the brand.
The court was deciding on the plea by resolution professional (RP) Bhrugesh Amin, to disallow promoter Morakhia from transferring the trademarks of SMAASH to privately owned FGAPL after it was discovered that the brand was transferred through a back dated deed of assignment signed in 2019. Amin did not reply to an email seeking comment.
Morakhia had approached the registrar of trademarks July 2022 for registering the brand name based on the original deed of assignment dated 31 August 2019. The court said Morakhia or other respondent could not explain the delay of more than three years for getting the brand name registered. “This itself proves and establishes that the earlier Deed of Assignment as well as the Deed of Cancellation and the present Deed of Assignment are fabricated and bogus documents brought into existence by the Respondents to scuttle the CIRP process and to take away the valuable asset of corporate debtor,” the order said, observing that the notarisation in both documents appears doubtful.
In response to ET’s queries, a Avanish Agarwal chief marketing officer FGAPL said the brand still belongs to that company. “The court has overturned the 2022 deed but not the 2019 assignment deed. Based on the original assignment deed and term therein of 2019, the brand belongs to FGAPL,” the spokesperson said. Morakhia did not reply to an email and messages on his phone for comment.

SEPL owes creditors led by Edelweiss ARC a total of Rs 452 crore, other lenders to the company are Yes Bank, SIDBI and Mabella Investment Advisors. It was admitted to bankruptcy in May 2022. Creditors are expecting that the NCLT’s judgement could revive the resolution process which was stalled due to the brand transfer.
RP Amin’s petition said Smaash and FGAPL are related parties having common directors and also having common registered office and official email ids, ET has reported in April. The brand transfer was completed in August 2022 three months after the start of the insolvency process, after which FGAPL inducted Abhishek Javeri, the son in law of Morakhia as director in November 2022, ET had reported.

'
global
streaming platform,
ZEE5 Global
, is growing its subscription revenue by 35% year over year, with the United States being its largest market, a senior company executive said.
ZEE5 Global chief business officer Archana Anand said the platform contributes 30% to ZEE5's B2C subscription revenue, even as the subscriber base remains lower compared to India.
She added that the average revenue per user (ARPU) in global markets like the US and UK is very high compared to India.
""However, the challenge is finding Indian diaspora in any country because they are a small part of the population that is scattered,"" Anand said. ZEE's OTT business is demarcated into India and Global, with the latter having a presence in over 190 countries and offering 2.5 lakh hours of content across 12 Indian and six international languages.
""The
ZEE5
Global business offers more bang for the buck for the company because we are monetising the same content in global markets,"" she added.

In FY23, ZEE5 recorded a 35% growth in revenue at ₹741 crore, while the operating loss expanded by 47% to ₹ 1105 crore.
Anand said ZEE5 Global's primary target audience is the 40 million strong South Asian diasporas that are spread out globally. Its key markets include the US, UK/Europe, and Middle East, besides Australia and Singapore. ZEE5 Global, which claims to have become the top South Asian OTT player in the US, hit the 1 million active user base mark in the market in October. As part of its next phase of growth, the platform has launched the Add-ons aggregation service in the US.
The service is akin to Amazon's Prime Video Channels but for the South Asian diaspora.
It has partnered with Simply South, Oho Gujarati, Chaupal, NammaFlix, EPIC ON, and iStream for the aggregation service. ""There is a demand to launch this service in other global markets,"" Anand added.
Anand said that the Add-ons service is a new revenue stream for the platform and is a win-win for all parties involved. She noted that the cost of acquiring one customer in the US is $90, which makes the streaming business unviable in that market.
""Through ZEE5 Global Add-ons, OTT content partners will get instant reach to the South Asian diaspora while consumers will not have to subscribe to multiple services,"" she added.
It is pertinent to note that Star India-controlled
Novi Digital Entertainment
's Hotstar exited the US in 2021. Disney+ Hotstar was called Hotstar in the US.
In fact, Novi Digital had sold the Hotstar US business to Buena Vista Video on Demand (BVVOD), a unit of
Walt Disney
, for Rs 178.13 crore.

Vistas Media
Capital, which has ambitions to raise $100 million in capital for its film and digital content projects in India, has closed a $10 million
funding
deal with
Kitara Capital
, a Middle East-based global investment group.
“We have raised $10 million from Kitaara Capital. This is our first investment for the company, and we intend to raise $100 million for investing in film and digital content over the next three years,” Abhayanand Singh, CEO of Vistas Media, told ET.
Singh added that the company will utilise the funds to develop, produce, finance, and distribute Indian content across theatrical and digital platforms globally.
""We currently have theatrical and non-theatrical films, as well as digital content, under development in Hindi and Tamil. We will make films with budgets ranging from $1 million to $5 million,"" he said.
The Vistas Media chief executive also said that some films will be monetised first through theatrical, while others might release directly on streaming platforms.
Live Events
Singh said that the company will also produce content for Punjabi and Malayalam audiences once it manages to raise more funds.
Sachin Kamath, co-founder and CEO of Kitara Capital, believes India’s media & entertainment (M&E) industry is ripe for growth in the coming years due to its young population.
“We believe that with a very young demographic, the media and entertainment sector is poised for exponential growth in the country, and we want to bring in institutional capital to address the gaps in the market,” he added.
Vistas Media Capital’s portfolio comprises film and digital content production company Golden Ratio Films, streaming platform Planet Marathi, MENA-based music streaming platform Anghami, animation studio Paperboat, NFT platform Fantico, and digital marketing firm Diquery Digital.
Golden Ratio Films’ Hindi content library includes Bhonsle, Albert Pinto ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai, Nakkash, JL-50, Ghamasaan, Baby Crasto, Lord Curzon ki Haveli, and Super Woman, among others.
In regional language, it has produced critically acclaimed Marathi films like AB Aani CD, Chadramukhi, and Goshta Eka Paithanichi in Marathi, besides two films in Tamil, including Writer and J-Baby, in co-production with renowned Tamil director and producer Pa. Ranjith.
The company has also co-produced The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir, which is Tamil superstar Dhanush’s first international film.
Its Hollywood slate includes Son, a road horror thriller starring Halloween fame Andi Matichak, and The Featherweight, in co-production with Hollywood’s leading production house, Appian Way.
Besides producing film and digital content, Singh said the company also plans to venture into the international distribution of Indian films.

"Govt content review proposal worries broadcasters, OTT companies",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/govt-content-review-proposal-worries-broadcasters-ott-companies/articleshow/105299339.cms,18-11-2023,"Mumbai: TV broadcasters and streaming platforms are concerned about the potential impact on their creative freedom from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s (MIB) proposed legislation that would require them to get content certified by an evaluation committee before broadcasting it.
As part of its three-tier regulatory mechanism to regulate broadcasting content, the ministry has proposed that each broadcaster and broadcasting network operator should set up content evaluation committees (CECs) and only those programmes certified by CECs should be broadcast.
The committee’s members would include eminent individuals representing different social groups, including women, child welfare, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and minorities. The central government may specify the number of members in the panel, the quorum required, and other details to assist the establishment and smooth operation of CEC.
The proposal would not only impact creative freedom of the broadcasters and OTT platforms but also push up costs and may even prove unfeasible considering the amount of content created, industry experts said.
TMT Law Practice
managing partner Abhishek Malhotra said the creative judgment of broadcasters and OTT platforms will be subjected to another review, which may not be acceptable to content creators.
Live Events
“There will also be an issue of sharing content before it’s proposed for public release—fear of disclosure,” he said.
An MIB official, on condition of anonymity, said the ministry wants to strengthen self-regulation through this move, adding that the broadcasters will have freedom in running the CECs.
Industry experts called it a misnomer.
While the CEC will be set up by the broadcasting companies, it will be as per the prescription of the central government, noted Siddharth Chopra, M&E practice lead advocate at Saikrishna & Associates.
“This, to my mind, makes self-regulation a non-starter,” he said, terming CECs as mini-certification boards.
The obligation of setting up CECs will apply to TV channels such as
Star Plus
, Colors,
Zee TV
, and
Sony Entertainment Television
(SET), streaming platforms such as
Netflix
,
Amazon Prime Video
, Disney+ Hotstar, and
JioCinema
, and platform services provided by operators such as Tata Play,
Dish TV
, and Hathway Digital.
A senior official from a large media company pointed out that all major broadcasters and streaming platforms already have standards and practices (S&P) departments to ensure their content are in compliance with rules.
“There is little clarity on the new CEC layer—is it inclusive of the existing S&P practices at the broadcaster level or exclusive of S&P?” said the official who requested not to be identified.
He also stated that big broadcasters have subject matter experts from diverse backgrounds like regional languages, culture, history, and religion. “The formation of the CEC would incur additional costs, which will put an extra burden on small broadcasters,” the official said.
A senior regulatory official from another media company said the biggest worry of the industry is that the MIB might eventually come out with guidelines on how the CECs should function.
The MIB official cited above said the broadcasters and OTT platforms will have freedom in running CECs and hinted that any extra burden on them would be minimal.
“Broadcasters already have processes through which content is vetted. The CEC mandate will ensure that the people who are vetting the content are known to everyone,” he said.
This new provision will be applicable 180 days after the legislation comes into effect.
The draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023, indicates that certain types of programmes may be exempt from the CEC certification.
Industry sources said genres such as news and sports could be exempt from CEC certification as they are broadcast live.
In the draft bill, the MIB has proposed a three-tier system to ensure compliance with the Programme and Advertisement Code besides addressing consumer complaints.
The three-tier structure involves broadcasters and broadcast network operators self-regulating at the first level, industry-led self-regulatory organisations at the second level, and the Broadcast Advisory Council at the third level.
This is akin to the grievance redressal mechanism created by the Information Technology Rules 2021 for social media, digital news, and streaming platforms.
The MIB has solicited public comments on the bill that, once enacted, will replace the three-decade-old Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995 (CTN Act).
The bill aims to expedite regulatory processes, broaden its scope to include over-the-top (OTT) and digital news platforms, and incorporate modern definitions and provisions for emerging technologies.
While the CTN Act of 1995 applies to TV broadcasters and cable TV operators such as multi-system operators and local cable operators, the proposed law will include content platforms such as TV channels, FM radio, and OTT, as well as distributors such as cable TV, direct-to-home (DTH), headend in the sky (HITS) and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV).

The jurors said The
World is Family
is “a vivid evocation of 100 years of history in less than 100 minutes of cinema”. The film focuses on Patwardhan’s family and their connection to leaders of the Indian independence movement.
Flickering Lights portrays life in Tora, a remote village near India-Myanmar border in Manipur without electricity, mobile network, hospitals, or even a functional school, 70 years after independence. Then the news comes that electricity may come to the village. The film shows villagers’ hopes and frustrations and lives in darkness intercepted by a few solar lamps here and there over about three years till electricity finally comes.

JioCinema will add fresh content every week thanks to its strategic agreements with prominent local and global studios such as Cartoon Network Studios, Dreamworks, EOne, The Pokémon Company, and Animaccord, among others.
Every account now includes a 'Kids and Family' profile, which grants children access to just age-appropriate information. Recognising the importance of screen time in children, the 'Kids and Family' profile is integrated with a one-of-a-kind 'PIN'-based 'Parental Control' mechanism.
With advanced algorithms and cutting-edge technology, the profile will allow parents to customize the content access based on their child's life stage, giving them complete control.
On creating a wholesome entertainment ecosystem for kids and their families, a JioCinema spokesperson said, ""At JioCinema, we are deeply committed to building a one-stop destination for all things entertainment. We are invested in understanding Indian audiences and their preferences, and we will continue to evolve as the preferred source for all their entertainment needs.

Netflix
and Amazon are among JioCinema's competitors, but Ambani has most recently taken on Disney's Hotstar app, with both offering free streaming of cricket matches.
In total, JioCinema will add around 3,000 hours of children's content, including movies and shows from Entertainment One, Animaccord, Cartoon Network Studios and DreamWorks, the sources said.
Those additions will come through Viacom18's existing content deals, or integration with its other streaming app, Voot Kids, which has shut, they added. Some Pokemon content was earlier on Voot, but the new JioCinema deal is a ""much larger partnership"", one of the sources said.
NBCUniversal told Reuters that ""kids and family programming"", including DreamWorks content, was part of a multi-year partnership with JioCinema announced in May. Entertainment One, Animaccord, Cartoon Network Studios did not respond to requests for comment.
In April, Viacom18 struck a deal with Warner Bros Discovery Inc. to include more Hollywood and international content on JioCinema, including hit series ""Succession"" and ""Game of Thrones"".

"Viewers, packed stadiums score big for cricket world cup",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/viewers-packed-stadiums-score-big-for-cricket-world-cup/articleshow/105246353.cms,16-11-2023,"Mumbai: The 2023 edition of the
ICC Men's Cricket World Cup
is among the most successful events from a viewership and spectator attendance point of view.
International Cricket Council
(ICC) chief commercial officer Anurag Dahiya added that digital viewership, both on streaming platforms and social media, is growing even as TV viewership continues to hold strong. For instance, the India-New Zealand semi-final on Wednesday had a peak concurrency of 53 million, which is the highest for any cricket match globally. Peak concurrency refers to the maximum logged in at the same time.
The tournament is arguably the best-attended event historically, with over a million fans flocking to the stadiums to watch the matches across 10 venues in the country for the first 42 matches.
The fact that India has one of the largest stadiums in the world - the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad - has also contributed to the 1 million spectator mark being exceeded, following lower-than-expected attendance for the first few matches. The
Ahmedabad stadium
has a maximum capacity of 132,000.

The One Day International (ODI) quadrennial event, which has a 50-over format, has returned to India after 12 years.
Dahiya said comparing TV with digital wasn't useful in judging viewership.
""I don't get a sense that the numbers are down for TV. The debate over whether digital is taking viewership away from TV is futile. A large chunk of what is going digital is ending up on TV as well. Viewing is also happening on connected TVs,"" he said during an interaction on Wednesday.
'Need to Look at Overall TV, Digital Numbers'
He also said that there is a need to look at the overall numbers on both mediums rather than bifurcating them. ""TV in India is still very strong. What is TV and what is digital is increasingly a hard distinction to make, particularly in terms of numbers,"" Dahiya said.
According to rights holder
Disney Star
,
ICC
World Cup consumption and average time spent on TV for the first 34 matches are up 10% and 12% to 244 billion minutes and 568 minutes per viewer, respectively, compared with the 2019 World Cup.
Dahiya noted that the live broadcast of the first 34 matches reached 450 million audiences, with new peak concurrency records being created digitally. As noted above, it was 53 million for the Wednesday semi-final.
The ICC's vertical video streaming innovation, MaxView, has been a success and has helped the Disney+ Hotstar platform grow its viewership base, said Dahiya.
On social media, ICC's exclusive digital content rights partner Facebook has seen 12 billion video views, which is four times the 2019 numbers.
While Dahiya refused to talk about sponsorship revenue, ET had earlier reported that the world cricket body governing could potentially earn close to $150 million from the event, which will be its highest from any event.
With reports estimating that the World Cup will give a Rs 13,000-20,000 crore boost to the Indian economy, Dahiya said that the ICC will issue a comprehensive report in two-three months after the event. The ICC has hired Nielsen to measure the economic impact of the 2023 World Cup on India. The 2019 edition of the World Cup contributed an estimated Rs 3,600 crore to the UK's economy.
Dahiya also stated that the success of the 2023 World Cup goes to prove that news of the demise of the ODI format has been exaggerated. He also asserted that each of the three formats - Test, ODI and T20 - plays a specific role.

How TIPS evolved from closed shops to race for digital crescendo via YouTube & Jio,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/how-tips-evolved-from-closed-shops-to-race-for-digital-crescendo-via-youtube-jio/articleshow/105124658.cms,12-11-2023,"From Beethoven to Rabindrasangeet or timeless classics from Indian movies, music lives forever. While the essence of music remains eternal, the technology behind its playback is in constant flux. The journey from gramophones to today's streaming services is a symphony of innovation that has revolutionised the way we enjoy music. However, this evolution has posed challenges to traditional music label companies worldwide, even killing many of them.
India too had lost a few favorites but some sailed through the storm and evolved. One such example of this transformation can be seen in the journey of
TIPS Industries
, who had to once painstakingly lose 400 staff as there was no work left for them when cassettes and CDs were dying and its manufacturing plant was shutting down. The industry was not just fighting the tech evolution but also crumbling to the raging and seductive piracy devil.
But now, TIPS, listed on Dalal Street, is almost making it a habit to post record quarterly revenues.
TIPS
was among the first in India to embrace the digital shift, capitalising on opportunities such as launching
YouTube
channels and collaborating with global music labels and streaming platforms. Their proactive stance against piracy was a game-changer. It also through the years took royalty fee cases seriously to fight copyright infringements and it believed in putting out a strong word on ethical partnerships and respect for creative works.
Statista pegs the
Indian music industry
to be valued at around 2,200 crore rupees at the end of last year and is set to grow to 3,300 crore rupees by the end of 2025. TIPS too looks to up their share in this lucrative market and it bets on a great journey ahead.
The melodious 90s
Live Events
Starting with humble beginnings, the Taurani brothers - Kumar S. Taurani and Ramesh S. Taurani - in 1975 started trading in LPs (Long Playing Phonograph Records) for major Indian companies - HMV, Music India, and CBS. Within a couple of years, they emerged as the leading dealers for these companies in western India.
However, influenced by Plato's wisdom that music gives soul to the universe, they had a bigger dream, which turned into reality with the birth of Tips in the 80s.
In India, Hindi music sales was believed to be dominating the industry’s numbers with melodious Kumar Sanu, Alka Yagnik or Udit Narayan’s songs being the craze from
paan
shops and humble salons of those days to big, fat, yet simple, Indian weddings where uncles would tap their feet to perhaps Govinda’s hit
aapke aa jane se
track.
TIPS came out with some of the biggest hits during this period, ranging from a song in Phool aur Kaante to Gupt, Andaz Apna Apna, Khalnayaak and others.
Since 1981, TIPS held the record for the most gold and platinum discs among all Indian record labels. It went on to sell 1,50,000 cassettes per day to the Indian market, have its own distribution system where a team of distributors served more than 1,000 wholesalers across the length and breadth of the country who, in turn, served more than 4,00,000 retailers.
At the start of the 90s, India's legitimate and pirate cassette sales totalled 18 crore per year, the second highest in the world and ahead of then most populous China, according to media reports.
“Cassettes and CDs were a very integral part of the culture in the 80s and 90s,” said Amit Doshi, head of IVM Podcasts, while reminiscing enjoying a Johnny Lever album with a lot of mimicry.
The noisy halt that silenced many
But in a matter of hardly a decade, all this came crashing down. The advent of MP3 CDs, particularly the surge in piracy, dealt a severe blow to the physical music market. By 2003-04, the landscape had shifted entirely, leaving the traditional business model in shambles.
""Suddenly, the entire physical business had really gone away in 2003-2004, all gone. We thought let’s keep quiet,"" Kumar S. Taurani, managing director at TIPS, told ET Online.
India Today had reported in 2001 that after touching a high of Rs 1,200 crore in 2000, music sales have halved. More people were listening to music, but all they were buying were pirated discs from even makeshift shops that opened at nooks and corners. Piracy was pegged to inflict a financial blow of Rs 700 crore, surpassing the entire industry's turnover of Rs 600 crore in 2002, as reported by India Today. Many music label companies were reportedly up on sale, or many thought of diversification.
Diversification to digital: TIPS’ fortunate non-pivot
During the tumultuous years of 2002-2006, TIPS faced challenges that nearly led to diversification into real estate.
In 2003, TIPS was “struggling” even as its large library of music helped it to earn money.
“So, we had our own resources. We thought to ourselves that, we have two options - one is to keep quiet or do something else, some other business and we thought of property development,” Taurani added.
However, the Taurani brothers fight over who and how they will run the real estate business.
Telecom symphony & TIPS’ phoenix moment
They thought of sticking to their love for music and films. Perhaps this fortunate pivot failure was a key turning point. A strategic decision to focus on filmmaking, exemplified by the success of multicast 'Race' that TIPS produced made them rise from the ashes again.
“We wanted to make a big, grand bounce back. In 2008, when Race released, the market had improved and we made good revenues from movie and the rights from the music that was a superhit.
This was the time when caller tunes played a significant role. The song
Pehli Nazar
from the movie as caller tune alone generated Rs 10 crores for TIPS.
The ring back tone business amounted to an 8,000 crore industry back then, with the music industry making Rs 500 crores out if it.
“Though the returns were not substantial, we managed to survive, and gradually, the music business revived,” Taurani said.
Platforms such as YouTube, Saavn, and Gaana soon emerged as the new conduits for music consumption. TIPS was among the first music labels from India to open a YouTube channel and its oldest videos date back to 2007.
“Then we thought - okay, business is going to be there because people will never stop listening to music,” Taurani said.
Taurani highlighted the industry's shift from selling music to users directly purchasing, subscribing, or experiencing it through ads on digital platforms. The move marked a significant turn in the company's fortunes.
“Now you are listening to music, or you are subscribing or maybe you are seeing the ads, and we are getting money,” he said.
Piracy's demise &
Jio
era
One striking triumph with the digital dawn was the decline of piracy. Taurani said piracy is now a relic of the past and the demise is due to the massive shift to digital platforms. The ease of access, coupled with affordable data plans, rendered piracy obsolete. TIPS' early entry into the digital space, including partnerships with YouTube and other international giants, played a pivotal role in this transformation.
The entry of Jio in 2016 marked another major turning point, catapulting the digital play to new heights. Cheap data plans fueled a surge in music consumption, benefiting TIPS Industries and the industry at large.
“Today, you are getting data for a low price and you are not bothered about data consumption. The Jio’s entry boosted our sales, in fact that is not just for TIPS but for the entire music business. Now there are platforms such as Amazon, Netflix that are all helping this industry,” Taurani said.
A Redseer report earlier this year said the Indian audio OTT industry has experienced a notable increase, with daily streams growing by approximately 1.6 times over the last three years, reaching 460 million in FY23.
Future Harmonies
Taurani foresees continued growth in the digital space for the next 7-8 years, with every household having access to IoT and entertainment.
“At present I feel the Industry is around Rs 2,700-2,800 crores, The Industry has so much potential that I believe in another 3-4 years we will reach 8,000-9,000 crores overall,” Taurani said.
The company currently holds an 8% market share, which it thinks will reach double digits soon.
TIPS promises its investors 30% on-year top line growth, but it has been delivering even 50% jump and remains poised for a melody-filled future. It also remains open for acquisitions and in 3-4 months may also want to expand into more regional music.
While the industry has seen what the tech evolution can do, IVM Podcasts’ Doshi says this is now an opportunity rather than a threat.
“The music space, or the audio space, has only been growing. I think that music as an industry, and audio as an industry, need to be aware of technological advancements and need to incorporate them in the business at large,” he said.

The media conglomerate saw 2.8 million subscribers leave the service, taking the total subscriber loss for the year to 23.8 million.
Disney's financial year is between October 2022 to September 2023.
The platform's average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $0.59 to $0.70 due to a lower mix of wholesale subscribers and higher advertising revenue.
Disney's loss of subscribers is likely due to the streaming service losing the rights to the Indian
Premier
League - which moved to
JioCinema
- and the non-renewal of its content deal with HBO, which has also moved to its
Reliance
competitor.
Star Sports
- the media company's India sports broadcasting arm - saw its operating profit shrink 29% YoY to $12 million while revenue fell 21% YoY to $92 million.

NCLAT adjourns hearing on IDBI's insolvency plea against Zee Entertainment to Dec 6,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/nclat-adjourns-hearing-on-idbis-insolvency-plea-against-zee-entertainment-to-dec-6/articleshow/105073883.cms,08-11-2023,"New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday adjourned its hearing to December 6 over the plea of
IDBI Bank
seeking to initiate
insolvency
proceedings against
Zee Entertainment
. A three-member
NCLAT
bench deferred the hearing after the counsel appearing in the matter sought an adjournment to complete the pleadings.
IDBI Bank
in its plea has challenged the order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which, on May 19, 2023, had set aside the insolvency plea against the media major, observing that it was barred under Section 10A of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (
IBC
).
In its order, the NCLT bench had said that ZEEL, which was the corporate guarantor for the loan availed by Siti Networks -- the principal borrower of IDBI Bank -- has committed a default.
However, the default was committed during the timeline specified under section 10A of the IBC.
Section 10A mandates no application for initiation of a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) can be filed against any debtor by any financial and operational creditor for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020, for a period of one year.
Live Events
This was a special provision inserted by the government in IBC to help the companies after the economic activities had resumed post-lockdown in phases.
The NCLT said Section 10A bars absolutely and forever, the filing of any application under Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Code, for defaults committed on or after March 25, 2020, up to March 25, 2021.
Siti Networks has taken a loan of Rs 150 crore for a working capital facility and as per the agreement, it has to maintain a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).
In DSRA, a credit balance equal to two quarters of interest on working capital was required to be maintained by Siti Networks at all times till the repayment. However, there was a default.
On March 5, 2021, IDBI Bank invoked the guarantee provided by ZEEL and called to pay Rs 61.97 crore with further interest from February 18, 2021. It claimed an amount of Rs 149.60 crore in default.
ZEE is merging with Culver Max Entertainment (earlier known as Sony Pictures Networks India), for which it has been given a go ahead by a NCLT bench from Mumbai. This has also been challenged by IDBI Bank in a separate petition.

IBDF
) Digital Media Content Regulatory Council (
DMCRC
) has advised its member over-the-top (OTT) platforms to avoid unnecessary vulgar and abusive content without justification.
The DMCRC is part of the Indian Digital Media Industry Foundation (IDMIF), which has been formed by IBDF, and has 10 members, namely
JioCinema
, SonyLIV, Disney+ Hotstar, and ZEE5, among others.
The advisory was sent out after the
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
(
MIB
) raised concerns over the excessive use of profanity, vulgarity, and obscenity in content produced by certain OTT platforms.
""The content shown by the platforms has a deep impact on society. The platforms have the freedom to tell stories the way they wish to, but it should be done after due diligence and with responsibility. This is the essence of content self-regulation,"" the DMCRC said in a statement.
It has also asked the OTT platforms to strengthen the self-regulatory framework and overall functioning of OTT platforms. Further, the OTT platforms have asked to conduct frequent meetings with content creators and production houses to sensitize them about vulgarity and obscenity in content.
Live Events
The OTT platforms have also been asked by the DMCRC to ensure that the content is in due compliance with the self-regulation framework, including the Code of Ethics.
They have also been asked to ensure an accessible system to lodge content-related grievances and build access controls to empower the consumer to make content choices with complete awareness and knowledge.
While asking the OTT platforms to take steps to strengthen the self-regulatory mechanism, the DMCRC also noted that its member platforms have been abiding by the self-regulatory framework.
""Since it is a continuous process, the platforms need to consistently adhere to the same and stay within the sacrosanct boundaries of our constitutional framework,"" it added.
The council is of the firm view that it is desirable that OTT platforms continue to keep the sensibilities of our diverse society and culture in mind while producing content.
ET reported in August that IDMIF and the Internet and Mobile Association of India (
IAMAI
) have told MIB that their Online Curated Content Platforms (
OCCPs
) are ensuring compliance with IT Rules 2021 even before the content is published on their platforms.
The IDMIF and IAMAI have stated in separate but identical letters to the MIB that OCCPs have agreed to go through a thorough process to ensure that the content they produce is in accordance with the principles of the Code of Ethics of the IT Rules 2021, which describes OTT platforms as OCCPs.
Furthermore, the two bodies have said that the OCCPs are taking precautions to make sure that none of the content they create has an adverse effect on India's sovereignty, integrity, or security, is harmful to India's good ties with other nations, incites violence, or interferes with the maintenance of public order.
The two organisations have said that, given the diversity of India, every OCCP is exercising due caution and discretion when highlighting the actions, convictions, customs, or opinions of any racial or religious group.
The letter followed meetings that the MIB held with select OCCPs on July 18 and June 20 regarding concerns about the presence of vulgarity, abusive language, and violence in over-the-top (OTT) content.
During the meeting with OTT platforms on July 18, I&B minister Anurag Thakur expressed concerns about vulgarity and obscenity in OTT content.

Centre appoints nodal officers to act against film piracy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/govt-appoints-nodal-officers-to-act-against-film-piracy/articleshow/104941179.cms,03-11-2023,"In a bid to curb film piracy, the government on Friday said it has appointed nodal officers who have been empowered to issue directions to take down pirated content from digital platforms. This move by

""We have fulfilled a big demand of the industry,"" Information and Broadcasting Minister
Anurag Thakur
told reporters here.
He said the government has appointed 12 nodal officers in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the
Central Bureau of Film Certification
(
CBFC
) with whom complaints related to film piracy can be lodged and action will be taken within 48 hours.
""Piracy is a big menace not only for the film industry, but for the entire world. Now, action against it is just a complaint away,"" Thakur said.
Officials said any original copyright holder or any person authorised by them for the purpose can file a complaint with the nodal officers to take down pirated content from YouTube,
Telegram
channels, websites or other online platforms.

Walt Disney to acquire Comcast's 33% stake in Hulu for $8.61 billion,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/walt-disney-to-acquire-comcasts-33-stake-in-hulu-for-8-61-billion/articleshow/104917994.cms,02-11-2023,"The
Walt Disney Company
has said that it will acquire
Comcast
Corporation-owned
NBC Universal
's (
NBCU
) 33% stake in streaming platform
Hulu
for $8.61 billion at a valuation of $27.5 billion. Disney hopes to complete the transaction by December 1.
Walt Disney said the acquisition of Comcast’s stake in Hulu at fair market value will further Disney’s streaming objectives. The announcement follows Comcast’s November 1 exercise of its right under the put/call arrangement between the two companies.
The two companies had set $27.5 billion as the guaranteed floor value for Hulu in 2019, minus the anticipated outstanding capital call contributions payable by NBCU to Disney.
Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology investor conference, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts stated that Hulu might be worth $30 billion given all the synergies.
Under the appraisal process agreed to by Disney and Comcast, Hulu’s equity fair value was to be assessed by September 30, 2023, and if the value is ultimately determined to be greater than the guaranteed floor value, Disney will pay NBCU its percentage of the difference between the equity fair value and the guaranteed floor value.
Live Events
As of April 1, 2023, Hulu had 48.2 million subscribers.
Hulu is a subscription-based DTC service with general entertainment content from the company’s various studios as well as content licensed from third parties. Hulu’s revenue is primarily derived from subscription fees and advertising sales.
Hulu offers SVOD services with or without advertising in addition to a digital OTT MVPD (live TV) service that is available with either of Hulu’s SVOD services and, since December 2021, includes the Disney+ and ESPN+ DTC services.
Hulu’s Live TV service includes live linear streams from cable networks and the major broadcast networks. In addition, Hulu offers subscriptions to premium services such as HBOMax,
Cinemax
, Starz, and Showtime, which can be added to the Hulu service.

"Studios fail to talk up movies, theatres pay the price",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/studios-fail-to-talk-up-movies-theatres-pay-the-price/articleshow/104897753.cms,02-11-2023,"ET Intelligence Group: After an exceptionally good September quarter, the Hindi film industry has begun the December quarter on a sombre note.
Each of the 14 movies released in October has failed to generate sufficient footfalls at theatres. What's unique about this is not the failure, but the fact that big studios and distributors backing these movies hardly invested in their pre-release marketing and promotion leaving moviegoers largely unaware of titles such as Dono, Mission Raniganj, Dhak Dhak, Ganapath, 12th Fail, Yaariyan 2, and Tejas among others.
The failure of these films also means the third quarter financial performance of the
multiplex
companies now depends heavily on the success of big titles including Dunki, Animal, Salaar, Tiger 3, Sam Bahadur and Merry Christmas which will be released later in the current quarter.
Some of the movies released in October are by well-known distributors and studios such as Pen Marudhar Entertainment (a distributor of Jawan),
Viacom18 Studios
,
PVR Inox Pictures
,
AA Films
, and
Zee Studios
.
Shaminder Malik, a trade analyst, expressed astonishment over the fact that so many movies were released in a single month yet the audience was unaware of them. ""One cannot rely merely on word-of-mouth publicity as for it to work the audience at least should know about the release of a film,"" he said, adding that a big studio can invest close to ₹200 crore on a film but follows a conscious strategy of not investing adequately in marketing the film.

On average, it is estimated that distributors spend ₹5 crore to ₹20 crore in marketing and promotion of a Hindi release.
""I was not even aware that 12th Fail was made by veteran director Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Distributors seem to be dumping content in theatres rather than having to compete with big titles in the coming months,"" said Ameya Naik, founder of Fantasy Events, an event management company.
Through the sheer strength of word-of-mouth publicity, the film 12th Fail is gathering a gradual momentum in metro cities. The film has collected close to ₹8 crore on the budget of ₹10 crore-11 crore, cite analysts. According to them, after an encouraging response over the first weekend of release, distributors have undertaken the promotion of the film.
According to Girish Johar, a producer and a trade analyst, when a distributor refrains from investing adequately in the marketing of a film, it shows a lack of confidence in its success. ""There has been no buzz for these films which is reflected in their fate at the box office. It is clear that these distributors knew these films did not shape up well.""
Atul
Mohan, another trade analyst, hints at the possibility that distributors may have recovered money through the sale of digital and satellite rights before the theatrical release. ""Given the lack of clarity about the success of these films, they did not want to invest incremental money in marketing.""
While the cricket World Cup is likely to have a bearing on the footfalls at theatres, Mohan believes that content plays a crucial role. ""Biwi No. 1 was a super hit during the 1999 Cricket World Cup,"" he added.
Investors will be closely tracking the industry developments to know whether multiplex companies are able to repeat their robust September quarter performance in the current quarter.

Maharashtra govt offers investment-based exemption to Adlabs Entertainment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/maharashtra-govt-offers-investment-based-exemption-to-adlabs-entertainment/articleshow/104879335.cms,01-11-2023,"The
Maharashtra
Government has told the
Bombay High court
that it has extended investment based exemption granted to
Imagicaaworld Entertainment
, formerly
Adlabs Entertainment
for two years of the Covid 19 pandemic period.
The company had filed a petition before the HC, seeking an extension of its entitlement certificate that is issued by the state government. The entitlement certificate was supposed to expire June 14 for the theme park, while the entitlement certificate for the water theme park will expire next year.
“The moot point was whether the incentives must continue under the GST regime. By way of an interim order the Court has -granted relief of the SGST portion. The related issues therefore emerge for extending the eligibility period especially in light of COVID lockdown. We are arguing for extension of period to compensate for reduction of State benefits and due to COVID. Vide Affidavit filed on 26 Oct, State has agreed to extend for 2 years for COVID shutdown - which is indisputable, however have not commented on reduction of benefits due to GST rollout,” said Abhishek A Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers, who argued for the petitioners before the High Court.
“The timely and pragmatic decision by the state Government will certainly boost industry confidence and tourism in the state of Maharashtra”, added l Rastogi.
The company, which owns and operates themed entertainment destination Imagicaa, had moved the HC seeking an extension of its entitlement certificate to 20 years. The bench of Justices GS Kulkarni and Rajesh Patil passed the order on June 9. Imagicaaworld argued that while the Tourism Policy of 2016 permits mega tourism projects to receive incentives for a 20-year period, the Tourism Policy of 2006 only allowed for the issuance of entitlement certificates with a 10-year validity.

On June 6, the bench passed an order directing the state government to take an urgent decision on Imagicaaworld's application dated August 5, 2022, wherein it had requested the state government to extend the entitlement certificate to 20 years. The Assistant Government Pleader (AGP) stated that the state government will take a decision on the application, and the decision will be accordingly informed to the court.
On June 9, the Maharashtra tourism department informed the AGP that the state government needs some time to take a decision on Imagicaaworld’s application. The department has also sought two months' time from the court to decide on the application. In an application to the state government last year, Imagicaaworld noted that the 10-year incentive period for its theme park and water park will end in 2023 and 2024, respectively. While stating that it has invested over Rs 800 crore in Maharashtra for setting up the Imagicaa project, the company added that the state government must allow it to avail of incentives for another 10 years
The company also said that it has been able to claim only 25% of the eligible amount of financial incentive that it was granted. Furthermore, it stated that the incentive period got wasted due to the COVID-induced lockdown between March 2020 and March 2022.
The company added that it was allowed to operate at 50% capacity for the balance ¼ of the incentive period. Last year, the Maharashtra-based Malpani Group acquired a 66.25% stake in Imagicaaworld Entertainment by way of preferential allotment of equity shares worth Rs 415 crore.

Incidentally, Sapphire FM has also made a bid of Rs 251 crore for Big FM.
The bidders couldn't immediately be reached for comments.
Both the bidders -- Radio Mirchi &
Orange
FM consortium and Sapphire FM -- have offered to pay the bid amount within 30 days.
Sources close to the process also revealed that the lenders are likely to ask both the bidders to revise their bids upward.
Live Events
Also, Rs 60 crore cash lying in the company's accounts will also go to the lenders, they said.
After considering the cash at Big FM, the total recovery for lenders could be as high as 55 to 60 per cent against the total admitted claims of Rs 578 crore.
Reliance Broadcast Network Ltd (RBNL) owned by BIG FM is the country's largest radio network with 58 stations and reaches out to over 1,200 towns and over 50,000 villages.
In February this year, RBNL, on the plea of IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd, was admitted to insolvency.
According to the insolvency application filed by IDBI Trusteeship Services on behalf of L&T Investment Management Limited, RBNL failed to repay a debt of Rs 175 crore.
Of the total admitted claims of the lenders of Rs 578 crore,
IndusInd Bank
's claim is Rs 172 crore, HSBC Asset Management Rs 238 crore, Franklin Templeton MF Rs 103 crore and Reliance Commercial Finance's claim Rs 64 crore.
According to the insolvency application filed by IDBI Trusteeship Services on behalf of L&T Investment Management Limited, Reliance Broadcast Network failed to clear financial debt of Rs 175 crore. L&T Investment Management Limited had subscribed to NCDs worth Rs 200 crore issued by Reliance Broadcast in three tranches in 2015 and 2016.
IDBI Trustee Services acted as the trustee for L&T Investment Management Services, while Reliance Capital acted as the guarantor for Reliance Broadcast Network. At the time of redemption of the NCDs in 2020, Reliance Broadcast failed to make the payment.

Reliance-Disney deal likely to face a valuation hurdle,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/reliance-disney-deal-likely-to-face-a-valuation-hurdle/articleshow/104660145.cms,24-10-2023,"Reliance Industries
(RIL) and the
Walt Disney Company
may face a hurdle in striking a deal for the American firm's India operations owing to the wide gulf in their respective valuations of the business, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
While RIL values Disney Star at $3-4 billion, Walt Disney is reportedly eyeing a valuation of $10 billion, as per a Bloomberg report.
Disney Star, the Indian arm of Walt Disney, comprises TV and digital assets, including about 70 sports and entertainment channels across languages and the Disney+ Hotstar streaming platform.
Star India
was valued at a whopping $18 billion in 2017 when it was acquired by Walt Disney as part of the 21st Century Fox buyout. India (Star) and the UK (Sky) were two of the biggest drivers of deals between Disney and Fox, according to people in the know.
Disney bought Star India as part of its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox, but lost out to Comcast for the Sky asset in the UK. Comcast acquired Sky for $40 billion in 2018.

In April this year, RIL's entertainment arm, Viacom18, was valued at $4 billion after a '15,000 crore fund infusion by RIL and Bodhi Tree Systems, which is promoted by Uday Shankar and James Murdoch.
The factors weighing against Disney Star, according to those in the know, include a drop in the paid subscriber base of Disney+ Hotstar, India's largest streaming platform, and mounting losses from the sports business coupled with the overall decline in the pay-TV ecosystem.
Disney+ Hotstar has lost 21 million subscribers after losing the Indian Premier League (IPL) digital rights. The flight of subscribers is expected to intensify as the platform is streaming the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup for free, besides the recently concluded Asia Cup.
Further, Walt Disney's regulatory filings show Disney Star's sports business in India reported an operating loss of $444 million for the nine-month period ended July 1.
""The biggest challenge for any player who looks at Disney Star assets will be servicing the sports losses in the coming years,"" said a veteran media executive, who did not wish to be identified.
Disney Star has committed close to $5 billion in sports investments between 2022 and 2027 on properties such as IPL TV rights and ICC digital rights.
On the entertainment side, Disney Star continues to be a strong player, with a 30% share of the broadcast market. The entertainment business, which includes channels such as Star Plus and Star Gold, particularly the southern business comprising channels such as Asianet, Star Maa, and Star Vijay, is highly profitable.
Experts said RIL might find Disney Star's entertainment business much more enticing since Viacom18 lacks muscle on the entertainment side, barring Colors.
""Disney Star is very strong in regional markets, while Viacom 18 hasn't made much headway in those, barring one odd market,"" said the media executive.

Disney said to near multibillion-dollar India deal with Reliance,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/disney-said-to-near-multibillion-dollar-india-deal-with-reliance/articleshow/104650681.cms,23-10-2023,"Reliance Industries Ltd.
, controlled by Asia’s richest tycoon
Mukesh Ambani
, is nearing a cash and stock deal to buy Walt
Disney
Co.’s India operations, according to people familiar with the matter.
The US entertainment giant may sell a controlling stake in the Disney Star business, which it values at around $10 billion, as opposed to piecemeal transactions weighed earlier, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions are private. Reliance views the assets at between $7 billion to $8 billion, some of the people said.
The acquisition could be announced as early as next month with some of Reliance’s media units merged into Disney Star, the people said, without providing further details.
Under the proposal, Disney will likely continue to hold on to a minority stake in the Indian company after any cash and stock swap transaction is completed, the people said. No final decision has been made on the deal or the valuation, and Disney could still decide to hold onto the assets for a bit longer, they added.
A representative for Disney in India didn’t respond to a request for comment and a spokesperson for Reliance declined to comment.

The deal talks are illustrative of Ambani’s disruption of India’s entertainment industry after he scooped up the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League for $2.7 billion in 2022. The billionaire’s JioCinema platform then chose to broadcast the hugely popular domestic cricket tournament for free earlier this year.
Reliance then scored another win by bagging a multi-year pact to broadcast Warner Bros Discovery Inc.’s HBO shows in India, content that was previously with Disney.
Even as Disney Star struggled with sliding subscriber numbers, the media group hasn’t ceded the market and had been making investments. It has been weighing other options for the business, including an outright sale or setting up a joint venture, Bloomberg News reported in July.
Still, Disney’s India streaming platform managed to draw in a record 43 million viewers on Sunday for the men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 match between India and New Zealand, the company said in a statement. That was higher than the 35 million viewership the highly anticipated India-Pakistan grudge match drew earlier this month.

Free digital streaming of cricket World Cup shrinks TV viewership,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/free-digital-streaming-of-cricket-world-cup-shrinks-tv-viewership/articleshow/104592025.cms,21-10-2023,"The cumulative audience reach on television for the first 11 matches of the ICC Men's Cricket
World Cup
2023 has dropped 8% to 90 million, as per BARC data for male 15+ NCCS ABC, India Urban + Rural, as consumers are increasingly turning to video streaming to watch live cricket.
In comparison, 98 million viewers tuned in to watch the first 11 matches of the
ICC CWC 2019
, which was hosted by England. The male 15+ is a key target audience for advertisers who buy sponsorships and spot buys for cricket matches. NCCS is the new consumer classification system that has been adopted by
BARC India
for the purpose of TV audience measurement.
Media experts attribute the drop in
TV viewership
to free cricket streaming by Disney+ Hotstar, which is raking in record viewership. Disney+ Hotstar is streaming the ICC Men's Cricket WC for free to mobile users. The event has returned to India after more than a decade.
""In real terms, the audiences for CWC'23 haven't declined but have split between live linear broadcast on TV and live
digital streaming
on OTT. If we look at peak concurrent viewing for the India-Aus match, approximately 8.2 crore audiences have been split in a 70:30 ratio skewed to TV. The same could indicatively be 85:15 in favor of TV for CWC in 2019,"" said TAM Media CEO LV Krishnan.
Disney+ Hotstar recently created a world record with a peak concurrency of 35 million for India vs. Pakistan match. The match had attracted 225 million viewers on the platform. Prior to that, JioCinema held the record for peak concurrency of 32 million for the Indian
Premier
League (IPL) final between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings.

EssenceMediacom South Asia CEO Navin Khemka said that cricket viewership is getting fragmented between TV and digital. ""This year, the concurrency numbers, even for non-India matches, are also very high. So, the cricket viewership is fragmenting. In 2019, the digital reach was not that big,"" he added.
Khemka said that the combined TV and digital viewership of the ICC CWC 2023 will be higher compared to the previous edition. ""The TV numbers are also decent considering the fragmentation in viewership,"" he noted. BARC data also shows that the average television rating (TVR) for the first 11 matches is down 13% to 1.93 TVR compared to the previous edition in 2019.
TVR is a combination of audience reach and time spent.
The India vs. Australia match was the most-watched game of the tournament with 4.77 TVR, while India vs. Afghanistan had a 3.41 TVR. The BARC data is for weeks 41 and 42 until October 13.
After the two India matches, the Sri Lanka vs. Pakistan match had the highest TVR of 1.67. The opening match between England and New Zealand had 1.4 TVR.
Disney Star, which holds both TV and digital rights to the ICC CWC 2023, is also airing the matches on the Star Sports network. The network is eyeing ad revenue between ₹2,000 to ₹2,500 crore from both TV and digital.

One of the sources said that despite financial institutions and lenders such as Axis Finance and

having appealed the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) decision approving the merger scheme before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
), the union could still happen by as early as the first half of November.

Corroborating this information, another source said that the merger is nearing completion, even as a media report suggested that Tokyo-based Sony Group Corp has held exploratory talks with
Walt Disney
to acquire its India assets due to the delay in completing the merger deal with ZEEL.
""While we are targeting to conclude the merger early next month, there is always a possibility of a delay considering the legal and regulatory formalities that are involved,"" said the second executive cited above.
Both Sony and
Zee
declined to comment. The Zee stock has climbed more than 40% since late June in anticipation of the merger, and the company now has a market capitalisation of Rs 24,550 crore.
Merger on track
Late last month, Sony Group Corp issued a statement noting that the Sony-Zee merger will be completed in the coming months without giving a fresh deadline.

Before making a debut with parallel cinema with “Eikhoigi Yum”, Romi was an successful mainstream commercial filmmaker as he made over 100 such movies most of which were box office hits.
Minutes after bagging his first ever National film award Romi said that Tuesday’s event was great and memorial, but the current crisis gripping the state has dampened his celebratory moods.
“I’m very happy with the recognition given to “Eikhoigi Yum” which is my first non-commercial project. As much as I wished, I’m unable to enjoy the moment considering the conflict going on in Manipur,” Romi quipped.
“I must thank Manipur State Film Development Society (MFSDS) for the inspiration it has provided me with the yearlong events it organized to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Manipuri Cinema (1972-2022). In fact, “Eikhoigi Yum” had the privilege of opening one of the highlights of the celebration, the first ‘Eikhoigi Imphal International Film Festival’ (EIIFF),” he said.
Ratan said Tuesday’s awards ceremony “is the pinnacle of my filmmaking journey which started in 1992. I’m overwhelmed by this honour. But sadly, the situation back home prevents me to indulge.”
Jury member Borun who is himself a national awardee filmmaker officiated as jury member for the national honours for the first time said “we had to view more than 200 short and documentary films in multi-languages. However, at the end of the day, beauty has no language barriers and language of cinema presided, and films made with passion and with the right intent stood out as always. I feel happy that Manipuri filmmakers did well in both the categories, feature and non-feature.""

Co-CEO
Gautam Dutta
said that the launch of the monthly subscription service will help the company grow footfalls during the weekdays, besides uplifting small and medium films, which are getting overshadowed by the big films at the
box office
.
The monthly
Passport subscription service
, which launched Monday, will allow subscribers to watch up to 10 movies per month for Rs 699 from Monday to Thursday, which works out to roughly Rs 70 per film.
In the first phase, PVR Inox has restricted the Passport subscription to 20,000 consumers. It is hoped that the subscriptions will be totally sold out in two to three days.
""The Passport subscription service will be a boon for small and medium films. For the industry, it will lead to the release of more films and grow footfalls,"" Dutta said, cautioning that this is not a price promotion but about removing friction for consumers to get to a cinema.
He pointed out that the trend in the film industry is that the big is getting bigger and the small is struggling while pointing to the box office collections of Jawan, Pathaan, and Gadar 2.

However, there are quite a few conditions attached that may limit its offtake. Ideally, PVR should have made conditions less stringent to popularize it and then limit it if needed,"" he stated.
According to Dutta, the subscription service will excite three consumer segments: women, senior citizens, and students. ""We call these segments time-rich and cash-poor. This service will make it affordable for them to come and watch movies,"" he noted.
Dutta termed the working professionals who frequent cinema halls during the weekend as cash-rich and time-poor. ""This segment is willing to pay a higher price during the weekend as they have limited time on their hands.""
The PVR Inox Co-CEO said that the Passport subscription service will be opened up to a larger audience in the second phase. ""We will study the consumption pattern and, after a month, relaunch it to a much wider audience,"" he stated.
While stating that the company wants to revitalize the film industry, Dutta said that the subscription service will be a success if it leads to more visits from consumers.
""More footfalls lead to more ad revenue and more spending on food and beverages. This initiative will move the cart for us and the wider industry,"" Dutta said.

National Cinema Day: The 'magic' of silver screen and good storyline thrives in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/national-cinema-day-the-magic-of-silver-screen-and-good-storyline-endures-in-india/articleshow/104359366.cms,13-10-2023,"Indians and their love for cinema is a well-known story which has been driving the growth of multiplex chains in the country. Interestingly, it's not just upbeat songs and full-fledged action sequences that bring the audience to these halls. It is the overall cinematic experience that the movie goers relish.
From blockbuster hits to films with social messages, the demand and affinity for the silver screen remains unbeatable for an equal mix of 41 per cent GenZ and Millennial respondents, a survey by
BookMyShow
(BMS) revealed.
According to the report, cinema is the most preferred form of leisure among Indians. Nearly 90 per cent on the survey respondents said that catching the latest movie release in the theatre is their usual go-to option for out-of-home leisure experiences.
In addition, 98 per cent of respondents stated that the cinematic magic can only be brought alive on the big screen, with a third of them attributing that magic to the
big screen
when especially helmed by certain directors, themes and VFX.
Cinema, the silver screen, the big screen – whatever you call it, it holds a special place in the hearts of people across the globe. In India, the love for cinema has not only endured the test of time but has continued to grow stronger, making it an integral part of the nation's cultural fabric. It's more than just entertainment; it's an experience, an escape, and a shared passion.

""The enduring love for
movies
over the years remains unshaken. First day, first shows continue as a sacred tradition for many fans, inspiring cheers, whistles and endless applause at the sight of beloved stars on the big screen. The resounding response to 'The CineFiles' survey at BookMyShow reaffirms the enduring allure of the big screen movie experience in India,"" Ashish Saksena, COO - Cinemas, BookMyShow, said in a statement.
""The film industry's tenacity and adaptability shine through its continual evolution. As an enabler to this world of movies on the big screen, it brings us immense joy to engage with and cater to both a burgeoning younger audience and devoted fans across generations, united in their love for this timeless form of entertainment,"" he added.
Evolution of cinema: From monochrome to 5D
Cinema has come a long way from its early days of black and white reels. Over the decades, it has evolved into a multi-sensory experience. Today, we have the privilege of witnessing movies in vibrant color, high-definition, and even in mind-boggling 5D, where we can almost feel the on-screen action.
This transformation, driven by technological advancements and creative storytelling, has been made possible because of one key factor – the unshakeable love for movies held by the audience.
Multilingual melange
In recent years,
Indian cinema
has witnessed a delightful shift with the inclusion of
South Indian
stars in Bollywood. Actors like Prabhas, Rajinikanth, and Vijay have garnered significant fan followings across the country.
This inclusion has brought a refreshing multilingual flavor to the Indian film industry. South Indian actors are now not only celebrated for their action-packed roles but are also given lead roles in Bollywood movies.
The trend reflects the audience's growing inclination and appreciation for their work, showing that good cinema transcends regional boundaries. ""35 per cent of respondents, language or genre is not a deciding factor at all, when it comes to choosing a premium format of watching a movie on the large screen. It is solely based on the movie and its content,"" said the BMS report.
Anticipation runs high
One of the driving forces behind the evergreen love for Indian cinema is the promise of what's to come. The pipeline of upcoming movies, especially those featuring the Khan trio and South Indian stars, keeps fans eagerly waiting for their next cinematic treat. The anticipation surrounding an SRK or Salman Khan flick is unparalleled.
It's not just about the stars; it's about the stories, the emotions, and the spectacle that Bollywood delivers on the big screen.
The survey by BookMyShow (BMS) clearly stated that
storyline
is the key determinant in making a decision to watch a movie in a theatre closely followed by factors such as the movie being a blockbuster release, its cast & director, reviews and ratings and how impactful the movie trailer can be.
The report by BMS also showed that 43 per cent Mumbaikars prefer storyline as the most significant criteria to catch a movie in a theatre. In
Delhi
, reviews and ratings determine the situation. ""For 32 per cent Bengalurueans, the director helming the movie is the most important factor in their decision to watch a movie on the silver screen.""
Resilient passion for cinema
What keeps the love for cinema alive and thriving in India? It's more than just entertainment; it's an emotional connection. The silver screen provides an escape from the complexities of life. It's a place to disconnect from reality and become fully engrossed in the stories, the characters, and the magic of cinema.
The audience, especially the younger generations like Gen Z and Millennials, find solace in the immersive experience offered by movie theaters. They relish the larger-than-life visuals and the exceptional audio quality that only the big screen can provide.
According to the BMS survey, 74 per cent of the respondents liked to keep an eye out for movies that resonate with them and plan ahead at least 3 days in advance, while 26 per cent prefer to catch a movie spontaneously.
In fact, 35 per cent in the GenZ generation prefer to watch the first day first show of a movie, the report added.
Affordable tickets on
National Cinema Day
As a delightful bonus for cinephiles, India celebrates National Cinema Day with a special treat on October 13 every year to mark the reopening of cinema halls post Covid-19 pandemic.
On this day, movie enthusiasts can enjoy the magic of cinema at an unbelievable cost of just Rs. 99 per ticket. It's a nationwide celebration of the cinematic experience, allowing people from all walks of life to partake in the joy of the silver screen.
The affordability of these tickets not only makes cinema accessible but also adds to the collective fervor for movies.
Now, as we eagerly await the next big release, we can be certain that the magic of cinema will continue to enthrall us, offering a timeless escape and a shared experience that binds us all.

NCLAT
) on Thursday adjourned the hearing to October 13 on a plea filed by
Axis Finance
against the merger of Zee Entertainment Enterprise Ltd (
ZEEL

.
The appellate tribunal on Friday will hear another plea filed by private lender
IDBI Bank
, which has also challenged the August 10, 2023, order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approving the merger.
Counsel appearing for Axis Finance requested the tribunal to adjourn the matter to Friday when it will hear the same petition filed by IDBI Bank.
During the proceedings, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Arun Kathpalia - both representing ZEEL questioned the locus standi of Axis Finance to file such a petition and opposed passing any order.
They also objected to the adjournment as IDBI's case arose out of a different set of facts, however, the appellate tribunal deferred the hearing of the case without issuing any notice over Axis Finance's plea.

Bigg Boss
17 to 12 sponsors from across traditional and new-age categories, the company's head of network sales,
Mahesh Shetty
, said.
The TV and digital sponsors signed up by the company include
Hyundai
,
Dabur Bae Fresh
, Tresemme, Appy Fizz, InMobi-owned Glance, Ching's
Schezwan Chutney
,
Reckitt Benckiser
,
MakeMyTrip
,
Paytm, Vimal Elaichi

Shetty said the company is in talks with brands from categories like mobile handsets, snack foods, chocolates, beauty, ecommerce, gaming and health supplements.
The ongoing ICC Cricket World Cup has not impacted Bigg Boss since the property delivers three months of visibility to clients, he said. Spot buy rates will increase as new sponsors get signed up, he added.

Israel Palestine war and Nushrratt Bharuccha's narrow escape: It was not easy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/israel-palestine-war-and-nushratt-bharucchas-narrow-escape-it-was-not-easy/slideshow/104344858.cms,11-10-2023,,entertainment
Blackstone eyes leading role in Disney India reel,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/blackstone-eyes-leading-role-in-disney-india-reel/articleshow/104327668.cms,11-10-2023,"Blackstone
, the world’s largest private equity firm, has initiated discussions with the
Walt Disney Co
to evaluate buying the media giant’s India streaming and television business, said people aware of the matter.
The senior India leadership of both companies have held multiple meetings in recent weeks. Blackstone is exploring either buying the business partially — a combination of assets including sports properties and media rights, and the Disney+ Hotstar streaming service — or the whole portfolio that also includes its linear TV franchise such as the flagship Star India TV network, OTT and a 30% stake in
Tata Play
(Tata Sky earlier), the people said.
It is widely believed that Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs — two former Disney executives who have been brought back this July by chief executive
Bob Iger
as advisers to help him navigate the company’s legacy television business and the
ESPN sports
network — have been the key catalysts to bring Blackstone to the discussion table. After their earlier stints in Disney, Staggs and Mayer have been running Candle, a media group that they founded with backing from Blackstone.
Staggs, a former chief financial officer at Disney, had held multiple roles in the organisation, including as its chief operating officer and head of theme parks. Mayer, once seen as Iger’s likely successor, especially after the launch of Disney+, had worked closely with the CEO on a series of acquisitions and was a key architect of Disney’s streaming strategy. Another factor that may swing a deal between Disney and the
Wall Street
buyout major is Vanguard — the world’s second largest asset manager after
Blackrock
and the largest shareholder in both firms.
What is still not clear is if Blackstone would eventually look at a bigger global transaction or just restrict themselves to India. Globally, the media giant has been beset with poor financial performance, less-than-optimal revenue, ballooning $44.5 billion of debt, a declining TV business, box office duds, strike by Hollywood writers, shareholder activism, large sale layoffs, falling share price and a major rift between the company and the state of Florida just after its theme parks opened after 2 years of Covid. Iger has been striving to wipe out $5.5bn in costs in an effort to “restructure the company, improve efficiencies, and restore creativity to the centre of our business” by focussing on just three businesses to drive future growth: film studios, theme parks and streaming while simultaneously considering “strategic options” for the company’s legacy TV networks like ABC. Iger has already struck a deal with Penn Entertainment for ESPN that will provide $1.5 billion in cash over the next decade and also negotiating with Comcast for the final price to buy out the residual 33% stake in Hulu between this September and January 2024.

Disney India
and Blackstone spokespersons declined to comment.
Disruptive landscape
There is still no guarantee that these discussions will culminate in a transaction, warned the people cited earlier. It is also premature to talk about valuation numbers at this point, they said.
In 2017, when Disney acquired Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, $14 billion was ascribed to the India franchise, including the minority interest in Tata Play. However, back-of-the-envelope estimates by industry players now peg that figure to be $5-7 billion, on the back of a fast changing, disruptive media landscape. ET could not independently verify the figure.
Analysts say, for a value conscious buyer like Blackstone, even this valuation will be steep. The only other media company that will boast of a similar valuation would be the $10 billion Sony-Zee combo. Viacom18 Media — a joint venture among Mukesh Ambani’s
Reliance Industries
, Paramount Global and Uday Shankar’s investment firm Bodhi Tree Systems — is valued at $4 billion.
In August, US multimedia company The Wrap first reported about the possibility of Blackstone outright buying Disney globally following the return of Mayer and Staggs. The Wall Street Journal on July 11th was the first to report that Disney is exploring strategic options for its Star India business, including a joint venture or a sale, a sign of strain at one of the
premier
properties it acquired from Fox.
Blackstone has evaluated several media assets in India over the years including Sony’s local operations,
Airtel
DTH,
Dish TV
and Eenadu; and had bought into Jagran Media Network. It had also weighed a co-investment with Star in Asianet for a minority stake, after Murdoch bought a controlling interest in the Kerala-based network from Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a former telecom-and-media business magnate and the current minister of state for electronics and information technology. K Madhavan, the current Disney India head, was the managing director and CEO of Asianet at the time.
""Diluting a strategic stake to a PE player and bringing capital into the company is a much better strategy than exiting India by selling the entire business to another entity,"" said Nitin Menon, managing partner, NV Capital. Menon noted that there are only a handful of players apart from
Reliance
Industries who might have the wherewithal to evaluate an asset like Star India. Reliance is believed to be also evaluating Disney’s India operations.
Mickey’s magic waning?
While it continues to be a dominant player in regional pockets, Disney has lost significant ground in the sports broadcasting business due to the loss of Indian Premier League’s digital rights to Viacom18 Media, which outbid Disney with a $2.7 billion offer and chose to broadcast the event free earlier this summer. Disney is now streaming the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India for free to woo back some subscribers even at the cost of revenue.
In August, Ambani also walked away with the BCCI media rights after stumping Disney this summer, bagging a multi-year pact to broadcast
Warner
Bros Discovery Inc’s HBO and other content library that were earlier with Disney. Disney+ Hotstar, which is operated by a separate company, Novi Digital Entertainment, had 40.4 million paid subscribers, but with an average revenue per user of $0.59 (under Rs 50). The app has been downloaded by over 500 million users but has been losing subscribers this year due to the loss of IPL digital rights and non-renewal of content deals. Reliance Jio had also refused to renew its mobile content deal with Disney+ Hotstar.

The actor who brought Israel-Palestine conflict to bedrooms across the world,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/the-actor-who-brought-israel-palestine-conflict-to-bedrooms-across-the-world/articleshow/104318304.cms,10-10-2023,"Before 2015, for most people outside the Arab region or those who were neither Jewish nor Arab, Israel-Palestinian conflict was a knotty ethno-religious dispute over chunks of land with too many exotic place-names and a jumble of claims and counter-claims. Then Netflix brought it right into the bedrooms across the world, and told it as a story of a dysfunctional Israeli undercover commando who comes out of retirement to hunt for a Palestinian terrorist he believed he had killed.
Fauda, which is Arabic for chaos, premiered as a TV series on Netflix in 2015, developed by Avi Issacharoff and lead actor
Lior Raz
, who was as real in his role of the protagonist as the story the series told. In its stylised action, breathless suspense, eerie intrigue and lyrical portrayal of revenge and loss,
Fauda
gave a face to the conflict. In its four seasons, Fauda showed how Israel-Palestine conflict is not just a war of ideologies or a battle for land but also a story of husbands, wives, parents, children, siblings and lovers.
Many also saw Fauda as Israeli propaganda dressed up as a racy thriller. But Fauda's popularity, even in Arab countries where people have deep animus for Israel, underlined its stark realism. After last week's Hamas attack on Israel, many would be interpreting the incidents through the Fauda lens.
Raz, who co-produced and co-wrote the series while also playing the lead role of Israeli agent Doron Kabilio, has volunteered in the ongoing war against Hamas and joined the Brothers in Arms, a group fighting alongside Israel. He shared a video in which he is seen taking shelter behind a wall as rockets explode in the sky.

Raz, whose father worked in Israeli internal security service Shin Bet, grew up in Jerusalem and spoke fluent Hebrew and Arabic. He too joined Israel Defense Forces and became a commando in the elite undercover counter-terrorism unit known as Sayeret Duvdevan where he served for a few years, That was when a Palestinian Arab stabbed his girlfriend to death with a knife in Jerusalem. Nearly a decade later, the murderer was released from jail in a prisoner swap, an incident that reflects in the story of Fauda which mixes love, violence and revenge in a heady script.
After few years of working as an elite undercover counter-terrorism agent, Raz moved to the US where he was hired by a security agency as a bodyguard of Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger. That's how Raz the commando got on the way to become Raz the actor. After working with Schwarzenegger, Raz returned to Israel in 1995 and enrolled in a drama school. Nearly a decade later, after acting in several films and TV dramas, Raz wrote and produced Fauda along with journalist Avi Issacharoff.
Raz, who had suffered from PTSD, said writing the script for Fauda was akin to therapy for him.
The reel and the real
Fauda was critically acclaimed for its realism. Last week's Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's resolute response can make viewers of Fauda appreciate how close the TV series was to reality. The unhinged commando Doron, who infilitrates a suicide bombing operation, and the self-perpetuating violence of Palestinian militants that has broken free of any imperative of justice blur the boundaries of right and wrong and portray precisely in a humanised idiom what appears so tangled in news and op-eds.
Despite Fauda showing things from an Israeli perpsective, it did not paint Palestinians as a monolithic, homohenous group of people. It tried to present the complexity of a resistence movement that spans from helpless victims to mindless terrorists.
“We gave a face to the other side,” Raz had said in an interview to The Wrap. “We show the complexity of the conflict to the point where the viewer doesn’t know how to feel anymore.”
“I’ve gotten fan mail from people in Dubai,” he said. “Muslims from all over the world have told us how much they love the show.”

Hollywood writers vote to approve contract deal that ended strike as actors negotiate,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/hollywood-writers-vote-to-approve-contract-deal-that-ended-strike-as-actors-negotiate/articleshow/104302701.cms,10-10-2023,"Hollywood writers
have voted almost unanimously to approve the contract agreement reached by their union leaders that ended a strike after nearly five months, while actors remain in negotiations to find a way out of their own strike. The
Writers Guild of America
announced Monday that 99 per cent of the 8,525 members who cast ballots voted to ratify the deal.
Trump-Modi Meet
The mega MIGA, MAGA plans of India's Modi and US' Trump
Trump says India has more tariffs than others
Trump's 'golden rule' for imposing reciprocal tariffs
The agreement was widely touted as a win by leaders, and widely praised by members, with major gains in payment, size of show staffs and control of artificial intelligence in scripts. The result of the vote taken over the past week was never really in doubt.
""Together we were able to accomplish what many said was impossible only six months ago,"" Meredith Stiehm, president of the WGA-East, said in a statement.
Meanwhile, nearly three months after their strike began, leaders of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists were back in contract negotiations with studios on Monday, a week after talks restarted.
Unlike the marathon night-and-weekend sessions that brought an end to the writers strike, the actors and their employers are moving more methodically in their talks, and it was not clear how much progress was being made.

Disney
,
Netflix
and
Warner Bros

""Awesome trailer,"" said an user. ""Hope this movie will be a Superhit,"" said another.
On the occasion of Air Force Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his wishes. ""Best wishes to all air warriors and their families on the 92nd Air Force Day.

Indian Air Force (IAF) Chief Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari, while addressing the 91st Indian Air Force Day today, said that if India is on the path to becoming a developed nation by 2047 the Indian Air Force must be one of the best by the time we complete 100 years.
""In my first address two years ago, I spoke about my experience with all air warriors, so that the Air Force remains relevant and contemporary.

Govt notifies amendments to decriminalise Cable TV law,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/govt-notifies-amendments-to-decriminalise-cable-tv-law/articleshow/104194642.cms,05-10-2023,"In a bid to boost investor confidence, the government on Thursday notified amendments to the Cable Television Networks Rules that provide the operational mechanism for implementation of the decriminalised provisions of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act. Section 16 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 dealt with the punishment for contraventions under any of its provisions. This section had provision for imprisonment, which might extend up to two years in case of the first instance and five years for every subsequent offence.
The imprisonment provisions have been now replaced with a monetary penalty and other non-monetary measures like advisory, warning and censure, an official statement said.
These measures will be enforced through the ""designated officer"" defined in the rules notified on Thursday. Moreover, Section 16 now introduces an appeal mechanism against the order made by the designated officer.
The punishments specified under Section 16 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 were decriminalized through the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provision) Act, 2023, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
The amendments are expected to encourage compliance with the Act without resorting to harsh punishments and sensitivity to minor or unintended contraventions, the statement said.

The inclusion of advisory, censure, and warnings in the range of penalties suggests the focus is on educating and encouraging compliance rather than solely punishing contraventions, it added.
The amended provision allows for the use of a range of penalties, which provides flexibility in addressing different types of contraventions. It allows for a more proportional response to the nature, specificity and severity of the contravention, the statement said.
The amendment in the rules defines a ""designated officer"" for imposing penalties and also streamlines the enforcement process by making it simple in addition to unburdening the criminal justice system.
It addresses subsequent contraventions and in addition to the provision for higher penalties, includes the provisions for suspension or cancellation of registration. This promotes consistency and discourages habitual or repeated contraventions.
The inclusion of an appeal mechanism provides individuals or entities the opportunity to challenge penalties or decisions. This ensures a fair and transparent process and safeguards against potential abuse of power.
The definition of common terms in the cable industry, like ""platform services"" and ""local cable operator"" have been defined in the rules for the first time to bring about uniformity in their usage.

Tata said to be in advanced talks for Temasek’s Tata Play stake,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tata-said-to-be-in-advanced-talks-for-temaseks-tata-play-stake/articleshow/104183217.cms,05-10-2023,"Tata Group
is in advanced talks with
Temasek
Holdings Pte to buy back a stake in its entertainment content distribution platform at a valuation of more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Indian conglomerate and the Singaporean state investor are in the final stages of discussions around the interest of about 20% in
Tata Play
Ltd., the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. Tata Group could potentially cement its grip on the platform, formerly known as Tata Sky, as it’s considering buying a stake held by its flagship private equity fund Tata Opportunities Fund, the people said.
Discussions are ongoing and there’s no certainty that Temasek and Tata Play will proceed with a deal, the people said. A Tata Group representative didn’t offer any immediate comment, while a Temasek spokesperson declined to comment.
Tata
Group was considering making an offer to buy back Temasek’s stake of about 20% of the content distribution platform, Bloomberg News reported in July. The conglomerate was weighing delaying a potential initial public offering for Tata Play, despite receiving the green light from regulators to proceed, people familiar with the matter said at the time.
A joint venture between Tata Group and Walt Disney Co.’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc., Tata Play provides pay television via set-top boxes and over-the-top video streaming through its app, according to the conglomerate’s website. It has a pan-India footprint of 23 million connections.

Netflix could move tribunal against Rs 196-crore tax demand,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/netflix-could-move-tribunal-against-rs-196-crore-tax-demand/articleshow/104113729.cms,03-10-2023,"MUMBAI:
Netflix
is likely to file an appeal before the income tax appellate tribunal against the Rs 196-crore tax demand raised by the I-T department over alleged tax evasion. This comes after the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) earlier this year ruled in the favour of the department allowing the tax demand raised by its international taxation wing.
The
I-T depatment
had contended that Netflix Entertainment Services (India) LLP acted as a dependent agent permanent establishment (DAPE) of Netflix. Total revenue generated by the company’s operations between April 2020 and December 2020 was above Rs 1,145 crore. Of this, Rs 1,008 crore was profit, of which attribution to Indian operations was calculated at Rs 503 crore.
“Netflix offered Rs 13.36 crore. Remainder of the profit, which is attributed to the operation carried out of India through PE arrangement in India, is taxable in the hands of Netflix. This amount was calculated to Rs 490 crore. Tax demand raised on the said amount stands at Rs 196 crore,” said a person privy to the development.
A Netflix spokesperson said, “We fully adhere to tax laws and their requirements globally,” without elaborating on the case.
The department had further contended that the open connect appliance (OCA), a content distribution network specifically developed by Netflix to deliver its TV shows and movies to avoid the traffic and fees, was based out of India, hence it is liable to pay taxes here as it was operated from India.

“The department’s contention was accepted by the DRP, which ruled in its favour, following which the company is likely to file an appeal before the ITAT. In the event the
ITAT
rules in the favour of the department, it has the option of moving before the high court against the order,” added another official.
According to Netflix Entertainment Services India’s financial data, sourced by
Tofler
, the company ended FY21 with gross revenue of Rs 1,529.36 crore. India had in 2016 introduced the so-called ‘
Google tax
’ on digital advertisements and widened it in 2020 to include e-commerce supplies or services to address the issue of income of digital companies escaping taxation in the country despite earning revenues through a large user base.
India contributed the highest net subscriber additions globally in 2022, driven by the launch of an aggressive pricing plan in December 2021 that was backed by a slate of Indian originals and licensed movies.
India is the largest market in the world by time spent on over-the-top services, according to an EY media report. Experts say that subscription revenues for the
OTT market
in India are poised to touch $3 billion by 2024.

Between 2022 and 2023, Toonsutra raised $2 million in a pre-seed round from high-profile investors including Lightspeed Venture's Jeremy Liew, Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin, 9GAG cofounder Ray Chan, Rotten Tomatoes cofounder Patrick Lee, Crunchyroll cofounder Kun Gao, former Publicis Groupe executive Rishad Tobaccowala, and Kabam cofounder Holly Lui.
Toonsutra launched the webtoon app for the Indian market across Android and iOS. An animated cartoon or collection of comic strips released online is known as a webtoon, which is projected to grow globally to $60.1 billion by 2030, according to Spherical Insights & Consulting.
Devarajan said Toonsutra's mission was to spark pop culture fandom for comics in India. ""That requires us to bring, for the first time, the best content in the world and solve some real problems like affordability and accessibility,"" he stated.
The webtoon platform will offer international and local comic content across genres in English, Hindi, and other Indian languages like Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali, and Marathi in an accessible vertical scroll format that optimized for mobile, according to Vishal Anand, cofounder and COO of Toonsutra and the former chief product officer of Dailyhunt.
""The comics are being turned into sort of episodic content, and each episode is bite-sized and snackable,"" Anand said, adding that the platform is targeting the 700 million youth audience in the country.
Besides aggregating the best-in-class content from leading publishers like Archie Comics, Valiant Comics, and Kenaz, the platform will also host content from leading global content creators like Stan Lee, Grant Morrison, Ryan Pagelow, Shekhar Kapur, Jeevan Kang, Mounica Tata, Rohan Chakravarty, and Alicia Souza.
The platform also intends to fuel the local creator economy by providing them with a platform to tell their stories to a wider audience in multiple languages. It will also help creators monetize their content on the platform.
Toonsutra will monetize content through the freemium model, which includes virtual coins, ads, and merchandising. ""All three will feed into building a larger base here or paying for this ecosystem as well,"" Anand said.

“After the second wave of the

, managing director and chief executive, Tata Communications, also said there is still time for 5G enterprise use cases in India to be adopted at scale.
“Currently, around 80% of the enterprise use cases can be executed on 4G LTE networks, and the remaining 20% need 5G. I think the task ahead of us is to convince enterprises to adopt those 80% use cases first, show them the RoI (returns on investment) and then graduate them to adopt 5G,” he said.
He added that while there are a lot of use cases for 5G enterprise in theory, the device ecosystem on the factory and plant locations needs to mature and reach a sizeable amount of 5G compatible devices for there to be any meaningful adoption.
Speaking on the company’s media and
entertainment services
(
MES
) business unit, which has grown by 20-25% over the past couple of years, Lakshminarayanan said the
Tata Group
company will continue investing in building its portfolio to keep the growth momentum.

“We have invested in technology, the product portfolio, and building an incredible team that can deliver live sports flawlessly for customers (broadcasters and sports organisations) week after week and as such have cornered more than 25% market share when it comes to global sports which reach a global audience,” Lakshminarayanan said.
The MES business is housed under the digital portfolio, which grew 37.5% in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, according to the quarterly earnings report filed by Tata Communications.
The company looks at live sports in three ways—global events with global audiences, regional events with global audiences and regional events with regional audiences. With 25% share in the first category, Tata Communications is now looking at the other two categories to scale up the MES segment growth.
“A simple extension (of our services for live sports) would be live news coverage among other applications. Our expertise in live sports broadcast allows us to pitch the efficiency of our MES services and products,” Lakshminarayanan said.
He also said that the addition of The Switch, a US-based company Tata Communications acquired earlier in the year, will also help strengthen the portfolio of services and products, and help corner a market like the US where regional sports like college football and basketball are consumed by a large part of the American viewers.
The company’s MES portfolio includes remote production of events, media cloud infrastructure, and global contribution and distribution.
For example, Tata Communications partnered with
Dorna Sports
, the commercial rights' holder for MotoGP, for Sunday’s race at Buddh International Circuit, near Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh. The digital services provider’s low latency video contribution and data network helped collect the transmissions from the cameras on the circuit and transported them to a remote production facility in Barcelona, Spain where the TV feeds, as seen by viewers, were produced. These feeds were then carried to over 40 broadcasters globally using the company’s cloud distribution system.

Delhi HC grants dynamic injunction to Viacom18 against cricket piracy,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/delhi-hc-grants-dynamic-injunction-to-viacom18-against-cricket-piracy/articleshow/103891567.cms,23-09-2023,"The
Delhi High Court
has granted Viacom18 a broad, dynamic injunction for the bilateral matches involving the Indian cricket team. Viacom18 owns the media rights to the bilateral matches organized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
With the help of this dynamic injunction, Viacom18 will be able to take rapid action against rogue websites that indulge in piracy. The order requires Internet Service Providers (IPSs) to ban access to such websites after being notified by Viacom18 on an affidavit.
Viacom18-owned
JioCinema
is providing free, 11-language coverage of the three-match ODI series between Australia and India that got underway on September 22. The series is being broadcast live on the following channels: Colors Tamil (Tamil), Colors Bangla Cinema (Bengali), Colors Kannada Cinema (Kannada), Colors Cineplex Superhits (Hindi), Sports18-1 SD, and Sports18-1 HD (English).
In order to safeguard its media rights with respect to BCCI events from numerous shady and pirate websites, as well as John Does, Ashok Kumar, and unknown defendants, Viacom18 had petitioned the Delhi High Court for an ad-interim dynamic injunction.
The court expressed its concerns about the ongoing threat of piracy and said that they had been inundated with lawsuits regarding such issues. It also highlighted the importance of robust anti-piracy legislation to solve the challenges.

It noted that there was a solid basis for an interim injunction and went on to rule that
Viacom
18 would not suffer irreparable harm without the issuance of an order.
The court further ordered that Viacom18 does not need to start any new legal actions in connection with any new alphanumeric, redirect, or mirror websites that are anticipated to proliferate throughout the duration of the bilateral series.
Viacom18 General Counsel Anil Lale said, ""Viacom18 has always been at the forefront in the fight against piracy. I am sure this is a welcome step for all cricket fans, as well as for bona fide broadcasters like us who spend huge sums to get these rights. While we are proud to say that we have won several battles against these pirate websites, we understand that the war against piracy is a continuing one, and we are committed to winning it.”
Apart from BCCI bilateral cricket rights, Viacom18 has digital rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL), Women’s Premier League (
WPL
), and other major sporting events like the Olympics 2024, MotoGP 2023, La Liga, and Diamond League, among others.

D and P Advisory Managing Partner Santosh N stated that the firm has solely focused on the WPL ecosystem valuation since the league is at a nascent stage compared to the IPL.
The IPL, he added, has been subjected to a more comprehensive valuation approach, including ecosystem valuation, enterprise valuations (presented as a range), and brand rankings, since there is a lot of historical data in the public domain about the league.
The brand valuation services firm has pegged the IPL ecosystem value at $1.1 billion in the inaugural season, which makes it the first unicorn in the country.
It added that the value of the IPL ecosystem has grown by 3.3% to $11.2 billion in 2023 on the back of a successful season that saw record TV and digital viewership.

In 2022, the IPL ecosystem value was estimated at $10.9 billion thanks to the record $6 billion media rights deal secured by the BCCI with Disney Star and Viacom 18.
D&P stated that the report represents the value generated by the IPL and WPL ecosystems as businesses. The firm has used the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to arrive at the valuation for both leagues. The DCF method estimates the value of an asset based on cash flows.
The report noted that approximately 60–65%, or $6.7–7.3 billion, of the IPL valuation accrues to the BCCI, with the ten franchises accounting for the remaining 35–40%, or $3.9–4.5 billion.
The average intrinsic business valuation per team comes to around $390–450 million, the report stated. The value of the franchises is closely linked to the central revenue pool, which comprises 70–75% of a franchise's revenue. The central revenue pool includes media rights and central sponsorship.

Supreme Court dismisses appeal against ND Art's insolvency,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/supreme-court-dismisses-appeal-against-nd-arts-insolvency/articleshow/103696914.cms,15-09-2023,"The Supreme Court dismissed a petition by
Naina Desai
, widow of late art director Nitin Desai, seeking a review of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order allowing bankruptcy proceedings against their company.
Nitin Desai
had been found dead in his Karjat studio on August 2, a day after the
NCLAT
dismissed his plea against initiation of insolvency proceedings, prompting calls for an investigation.
“We do not find any good ground and reason to interfere with the impugned judgement and hence the appeal is dismissed,” a two-judge bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti said in a short order Friday.
The apex court's dismissal clears the ground for recovery proceedings against ND's Art World Pvt Ltd, the company promoted by Nitin and Naina Desai, which owes Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. close to Rs 300 crore in principal, interest and other dues.
“The recovery proceedings, which were already underway, though delayed, will now continue. The case is already in the
NCLT
and will now resume its normal course,” said a person aware of the process.
The Mumbai bench of the NCLT had commenced insolvency proceedings against ND’s Art World in July, almost a year after CFM ARC had approached the court to recover its dues. But in between the application being filed and getting admitted, CFM sold the loans to
Edelweiss ARC
, which is now pursuing the matter in court.

The case came into the limelight after BJP MLA Ashish Shelar raised the issue in the Maharashtra assembly through a point of order and demanded an investigation. Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had also promised a thorough probe.
A first information report (FIR) alleging abetment of suicide was filed against four Edelweiss Group officials including RK Bansal, CEO of Edelweiss ARC, and group chairman Rashesh Shah. Resolution professional Jitender Kothari was also named in the FIR. The Bombay High Court is hearing a petition for quashing of the FIRs.
“With the Supreme Court order, now the case can move forward. All said and done, there are about Rs 300 crore of dues pending which have to be recovered,” said a second person aware of the process.
Edelweiss did not reply to an email seeking comment. Naina Desai could not be immediately reached.
The ND’s Art World studio and its accompanying land had been used as collateral for the loan.
“There is a potential value to the land and the studio accompanying it of about Rs 200 crore, which can help to recover dues. The current promoters can also arrange funds and look for a settlement,” said another person aware of the process.
The principal borrowed from Edelweiss subsidiary ECL Finance between 2016 and 2018 amounted to Rs 181 crore.
CFM ARC, which had bought the bad loan from ECL in December 2020, could not recover its dues through action under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (Sarfaesi) Act and approached the NCLT for recovery through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process in July 2022. By the time the case was admitted in July 2023, the account had changed hands to Edelweiss ARC.
Earlier this month, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT allowed the application of the resolution professional in the case, Jitender Kothari, seeking immunity from any depreciation or damage to any property, premises and assets of ND’s Art World because of the prevailing circumstances.
Kothari had pleaded that he be permitted to continue with the resolution against ND’s Art “only after normalcy is restored.”

"Netflix, Yash Raj Films ink long-term content deal",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/netflix-yash-raj-films-ink-long-term-content-deal/articleshow/103689843.cms,15-09-2023,"Netflix
and
Yash Raj Films
(
YRF
) have established a new, long-term creative partnership through which they will collaborate to create films and series for audiences in India and around the world.
The first project to come out of this partnership is the character-driven thriller
The Railway Men
, a four-part series starring R. Madhavan, Kay Kay Menon, Divyendu Sharma, and Babil Khan, which is directed by debutant director Shiv Rawail.
The second, Maharaj, is a film marking the debut of actor Junaid Khan and also stars Jaideep Ahlawat, Sharvari, and Shalini Pandey. The film has been directed by Siddharth P. Malhotra, whose last film, Hichki, was a global hit.
Netflix India VP of Content Monika Shergill said, ""We are passionate about serving our broad audiences with series and films that they connect with and love, and we want to do more of this. Yash Raj Films has defined the essence of Indian filmmaking. They are one of the most respected storytellers in the industry. From Kabhi Kabhie to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, from War to Pathaan, their signature stories have been part of our lives and continue to fuel the zeitgeist. Together, we are confident that we can entertain the world with quality films and series like never before.""
Yash Raj Films CEO Akshaye Widhani said, ""YRF’s mission is to create entertaining, inspiring, and extraordinary stories from India for the world. Netflix is the biggest streaming service in the world and offers us the opportunity to tell our stories in over 190 countries. Their belief in the ‘content-first’ approach is noteworthy and synergistic with our ethos. This partnership will certainly push YRF as a storyteller to new audiences and allow them to consume Indian stories in their own languages too. India is a young and aspirational country. We have 1.4 billion stories to tell the world. We want to showcase our content as well as provide a platform for our brilliant homegrown talent to reach a global audience.""
Live Events
The Railway Men is a show based on the deadly gas leak in the central Indian city of Bhopal. This is the untold story of the unsung heroes who rose to the occasion that night to save the city and its people. This is the story of their courage, their sense of duty, and their humanity.
Maharaj is an incredible David vs. Goliath story set in the 1800s about how a regular man, a journalist by profession, takes on a powerful role model of society, hailed by many as a messiah for the masses. The fearless reporter uncovers a series of incidents that shake the very foundation of society.

Trai plans consultation paper on OTT players,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/trai-plans-consultation-paper-on-ott-players/articleshow/103643170.cms,14-09-2023,"The
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai) is planning to float a consultation paper on some regulatory issues pertaining to over-the-top (OTT) video platforms like Netflix,
Prime Video
, Disney+ Hotstar, and
JioCinema
, people privy to the development told ET.
While regulation of OTT content comes under the ambit of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (
MIB
), the carriage part comes under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Trai will look into such issues.
The consultation paper will deal with issues like bringing price parity between OTT video platforms and traditional distribution platforms like cable TV and direct-to-home (DTH) services and applying some of the rules for the broadcasting sector to OTT when it comes to live content, one of the persons cited above said.
While TRAI has neither confirmed nor denied that it is planning to come out with a consultation paper, industry watchers said the consultation process is the first step in formulating rules for a fledgling segment that is making massive losses due to cut-throat competition among over 40
OTT platforms
in the country.
In the video content industry, broadcast companies are bound by regulations on issues like pricing, bundling, and distribution of content, whereas no such rules exist for OTT players.

Trai is likely to issue the consultation paper on a suo-motu basis as it has not received any reference from the government, a second person aware of the development said.
An email sent to Trai chairman
PD Vaghela
didn't elicit any response till press time Wednesday.
There have been calls from different stakeholders in the telecom and broadcasting sectors to ensure level-playing field between broadcasting and OTT segments.
One of the issues Trai’s consultation paper is likely to consider is whether there is a need to define TV channels on the basis of content, irrespective of the distribution mode, and whether live TV channels should be permitted on OTT, people cited above said.
The regulator is also contemplating whether there is a need to make exclusive live content like sports available to all distribution platforms. Currently, most OTT platforms have exclusive content on their platforms that is available only to subscribers/users.
The regulator is likely to look into extending the Sports Act 2007, which currently applies to sports broadcasters, to OTT. This Act mandates media rights owners to mandatorily share the signals of sporting events of national importance like the Olympics and the ICC Cricket World Cup with Prasar Bharati.
The issue of applying the ‘must provide’ and ‘must carry’ clauses, which currently exist in the broadcasting sector, to OTT could also be put up for discussion.
Under the ‘must provide’ clause, broadcasters have to share the signals of their channels with all distribution platforms on a non-discriminatory basis while the ‘must carry’ provision ensures that distribution platforms carry channels of all broadcasters without any discrimination.
The definition of OTT platforms that are likely to come under the proposed regulatory framework will also be discussed in the consultation paper, sources said.
Trai chairman Vaghela had more than once in the past talked about the need to create a level-playing field between OTT and TV broadcasting.
Interestingly, at the recent FICCI Frames 2023 event, he said there is no need to regulate new players while there is a need to reduce the regulatory burden of the broadcasting industry.
“I will be very happy if the industry sits together and gives me a roadmap on how we should go for forbearance,” Vaghela had told broadcast industry stakeholders while citing the example of the telecom sector, where Trai is following the forbearance policy on tariffs. “I would scoff at the idea of regulating new players. I would not want the new players to be regulated or brought under the licensing regime. Existing players must be given some sort of relief,” he had said.

According to him, the people of India are so aware and energised that he believes the prime minister's goal of making India a developed nation by 2047 will be achieved in the next eight to 10 years.
He noted that the people of India now want to work for everyone, contribute to the nation's development and not for themselves alone. He said this is in addition to the tremendous work being done by the current government.
Having travelled across the world, Kailash asserted under Modi's leadership, India's image has gained more prominence in the world, and he considers this as a ""yagna"" and ""anusthan"".
Kailash said that it was the same country, same people and officials, but the prime minister's leadership style and work ethic have made all the difference.
The singer said that the world leaders who came to attend the recently concluded G20 Summit were impressed by Modi's leadership and India's development, adding that this makes every Indian proud.
He noted that making the African Union a part of the G20 was a unique and inclusive move and added that India's humanity, work and spiritualism are now becoming global.
In addition to Kailash's devotion to singing, which often makes him travel to different parts of the world, the singer is also involved in various non-profit activities through his
Kailash Kher Foundation
and initiatives like Nayii Udaan, which provides young talents with a platform and the Mehar Rangat, to save the old dying art of folk and Indian music.
""It's my own humble contribution to the society,"" said the singer, who also has the Kailash Kher Academy for Learning Art.
Kailash was raised in an Ashram and is known for bringing spiritualism and devotional music into Bollywood.
""Today my songs are sung by sadhus and even clubs,"" he said, adding that his music is now being sung and performed by international stars, including British singer Zayn Malik and Grammy-winning musician Richard Bona, who is based out of New York.
Responding to a question about India's influence overseas, Kailash said it is far beyond Bollywood. Not just Bharat's culture, music, and art, but also its ""way of life,"" ""lifestyle"", yoga, ayurveda, its humanity and sensibility has ""hypnotised"" and mesmerised the entire world,"" he said.
Asserting that Bharat's ""sanatan"" culture is nature-friendly and unique, Kailash said as the world realises this uniqueness, they are getting attracted towards it like never before.

SAT adjourns hearing of ZEEL chief's plea against Sebi order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/sat-adjourns-hearing-of-zeel-chiefs-plea-against-sebi-order/articleshow/103519083.cms,09-09-2023,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (
SAT
) on Friday adjourned the hearing of
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
(
ZEEL
) MD and CEO
Punit Goenka
's plea challenging the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (
Sebi
) order to September 14.
Goenka is challenging the capital market regulator's confirmatory order of August 14 barring him and his father, Subhash Chandra, Chairman Emeritus of ZEEL, from holding directorship or managerial position in any listed company or their subsidiaries.
The matter assumes significance as ZEEL is in the process of merging with Culver Max Entertainment (Sony) and Goenka was to be the MD & CEO of the merged entity until the Sebi order barred him from holding any managerial positions.
Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch's August 14 order prevents Punit Goenka from becoming the MD and CEO of the combined Sony-Zee entity until the regulator concludes its investigation in an alleged fund-diversion case against the father-son duo.
The capital market regulator is probing allegations that Goenka and his father,
Subhash Chandra Goenka
, diverted funds from Zee to other Essel Group companies without seeking board approval.

PVR Inox
co-CEO Gautam Dutta said Jawan has been released at a time when consumers are flocking to cinemas in record numbers.
“If the unprecedented audience response is anything to go by, we are confident that Jawan will not only be the biggest film of this year but will end up adding immense strength to the cinema ecosystem,” he said.
The film industry had a phenomenal run in August, with a record box office collection of over Rs 1,000 crore on the back of Gadar 2, OMG 2, Jailer, Dream Girl 2, and Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani.
Sunny Deol starrer Gadar 2 has collected Rs 662 crore in box office collections globally. Rajinikanth starrer Jailer's global sales stand at Rs 593 crore. OMG-2, which features Akshay Kumar and Pankaj Tripathi in key roles, has so far mopped up Rs 218 crore. The box office earnings are based on Sacnilk data.
PVR Inox had stated that August was its single biggest box office month of all time, with a gross box office revenue of Rs 532 crore across its theatres in the country.
""With the enormous opening day for Jawan and a spate of movies like Tiger 3, Animal, and Dunki releasing in the next quarter, it looks like Bollywood has enough ammunition up its sleeve to deliver a sizeable number of blockbusters for this financial year. Add to that a slew of movies from down south like Salaar, which could further add fuel to the movie mania this year. All in all, FY 23–24 will end on a very high note for Indian movies,"" said Nitin Menon, managing partner of NV Capital, a private credit fund.
In a recent report, Elara Capital SVP Karan Taurani noted that Jawan's lifetime net box office collection will be in the range of Rs 350 crore to Rs 450 crore, with the film expected to breach the upper end of the guidance if the content appeals to audiences.
Taurani also stated that the back-to-back hits in recent weeks have come as a major respite for the Hindi film industry. ""The multiplex industry will reach pre-Covid level occupancy in Q2 FY24. The average occupancy levels in July and August were 30% and are expected to be in a similar range in September,"" he added.
Until Friday, Jawan had clocked ticket sales of 3.2 million on BookMyShow. With advance ticket sales of 1.6 million, Jawan is the biggest Shah Rukh Khan film in terms of advance sales, the platform stated.
BookMyShow COO - Cinemas Ashish Saksena noted that over a third of Jawan's ticket sales have come from single-screen theatres. Ticket sales have picked up for all languages, he said.
“What is interesting to note is that the Hindi language version of the film has specifically seen tremendous interest from markets across the south and east India such as Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai, even as other metros and non-metros across the country, including Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Pune, Coimbatore, and Bhubaneswar, are propelling the pace for advance sales,” he said.
Produced by Red Chillies Entertainment and co-written and directed by Atlee, Jawan has reportedly been made on a budget of Rs 300 crore. The movie's star cast also includes Vijay Sethupathi, Nayanthara and Sanya Malhotra.

's
Pathaan
opened the gates of fortune for stakeholders of Bollywood and movie theatres including Dalal Street's
PVR Inox
, then the superstar's recent flick
Jawan
is another shot in the arm that the industry would love. The movie business houses here had recently got busy ringing in the cash register with the roaring success of some other movies too from Hollywood to India.
Some had seen Pathaan to be a one-off hit piggybacking Shah Rukh Khan’s return to silver screen after a hiatus. In what is now an iconic scene from Pathaan - Shah Rukh Khan and Bollywood's other megastar Salman Khan in a scene discussed how the 'responsibilities' to save are on their shoulders. Before Salman's next Tiger 3 releases, Bollywood has delivered a flurry of blockbusters, showcasing Ranveer Singh's classical dance in Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani to Sunny Deol plucking out an hand pump in Gadar 2.
The Indian cinema industry, after enduring a prolonged period of uncertainty, had made a remarkable comeback, dazzling audiences and making history with a staggering collection of Rs 390 crore for the August 11 to 13 weekend. The mass-favourite Rajinikanth's 'Jailer', power-packed Sunny Deol's 'Gadar 2' and Akshay Kumar's 'OMG 2' helped the industry have record success. These releases came while the pink world of Barbie was helping the industry have a fantastic ride and the black-and-white world of Oppenheimer was trouncing Nolan's previous collection records.
Gadar 2 and OMG 2 reported net box office collections of Rs 470 crore and Rs 140 crore until Sep 6, Elara noted Capital. Rajinikanth's Jailer has also reportedly earned about Rs 341 core net from box office so far.
PVR Inox, India's largest multiplex chain operator, posted 32% on-year jump in revenues for the quarter ended Jun. 30. It's shares have jumped more than 15% in a month and are up nearly 28% year to date.

Shah Rukh Khan's 'Jawan' roars to a jubilant start with 100% theater occupancy in West Bengal
It was trading at Rs 1,856 on BSE at 10.15 am on Sep 8.
Now, with the release of Jawan and some other big-budget movies in the pipeline such as Salman Khan's Tiger 3, Ranbir Kapoor's Animal and
SRK
's next Dunki, among others, the whistles and loud cheer of cinegoers are likely to continue and help the businesses add more revenues.

Profitability for PVR INOX may be the highest in Q2FY24 in the post Covid era, on the back of better advertising revenue growth, sustained metrics and healthy occupancy, Elara Capital's Analyst Karan Taurani wrote in a report.

""The performance of large-budget films – Tiger 3, Animal, Merry Christmas and Dunki is a key monitorable in order to sustain Q3FY24 revenue,"" he said.
Moving back to what's happening at the moment though, SRK and Nayanthara starrer Jawan is expected to attract lifetime net box office in the range of Rs 350 to Rs 450 crores, according to Elara Capita. The brokerage believes Jawan may also breach the upper end of its guidance if the content is good and finds relevance with the audience.
""This film is set to have a strong recall in southern markets too, as it is directed by Atlee. (We) Expect collections from the dubbed version to be ~10% of the overall net BO for Jawan,"" Elara's Taurani said.
In fact, initial reports suggest that Jawan has clinched the record of becoming the biggest Hindi opener of all time, beating Pathaan. The movie did open with loud cheers from the fandom of Shah Rukh Khan, who is popularly called to be the king of Bollywood, and a movie analyst also spoke of how this movie is about 'brea-KING' records.
""The film has released at a time when the industry is seeing its glorious days with consumers going out to cinemas in huge numbers. If the unprecedented audience response is anything to go by, we are confident that Jawan would not only be the biggest film of this year, but would end up adding immense strength to the cinema ecosystem,” said Gautam Dutta, Co-CEO, PVR INOX.
Ashish Saksena, COO – Cinemas, BookMyShow, said ticket sales have picked up across the length and breadth of the country for all languages, growing multi-fold for the Tamil and Telugu versions of the film, although the Hindi version is naturally taking the lead.
""Ticket sales for Jawan at single screen theatres alone has contributed a significant 36% of sales on BookMyShow so far...With Jawan's extensive reach encompassing diverse audience segments, including both multiplexes and widespread single-screen presence, the potential it holds knows no bounds,"" Saksena added.
Elara expects Hindi box office in Q2 to be the best quarter in the post-Covid era as overall multiplex occupancy is expected to breach closer to pre-Covid level of 32% for the merged company.
Net Hindi box office may rise approximately 31% versus pre-Covid level in Q2FY24, backed by films performing well consistently, it said.
Elara said while sustaining the profitability of PVR next shifts to the shoulders of other stars from Salman Khan to Ranbir Kapoor, the similar levels of occupancy in the third quarter may lead to a potential earnings upgrade for PVR Inox.
The brokerage expects an annual occupancy of 25% in FY24E so far (H1FY24 estimated occupancy is ~26%), and it has a Buy rating on PVR INOX with a target price of Rs 2,050.

The company recently bagged the TV and digital rights to all the domestic and international cricket matches held in India for ₹5,963 crore till 2028. The company will be paying ₹67.76 crore per match, including ₹35.23 crore a match for digital and ₹32.53 crore per match for TV.
Last year, the company won the digital rights to the IPL for a sum of ₹23,758 crore till 2027.
""We want to run a profitable sports business. With all the building blocks in place, all our efforts are directed towards building a profitable sports business. At a large scale, you can't afford to have a loss-making sports business,"" said Jayaraj.
He further stated that the BCCI media rights acquisition will bolster Viacom18's sports business as it has come at a reasonable price. ""We have won the BCCI rights at a good price, and this is something that will work out very well for us. Indian cricket is still among the preeminent viewing events in the country,"" Jayaraj said.
Live Events
While Viacom18 has been a big believer in digital, the company's decision to bid for the BCCI TV rights surprised many.
Nevertheless, Jayaraj said that the company's fundamental perspective remains unchanged: digital is on the rise, while television is experiencing a decline.
""While many consumers have fully moved to digital, there are some consumers who are yet to fully move to digital. We want to use the power of cricket to enable the transition of consumers from linear TV to digital, which includes connected TV (
CTV
),"" he stated.
Jayaraj believes that the monetisation of the sports content will be driven by mobile and CTV, as that's where consumers are moving.
""If IPL experience is anything to go by, making money on TV is tough,"" he said. Viacom18 will bundle TV and digital ad inventory for India's bilateral cricket matches.
However, advertisers will also have the choice to buy ad inventory on any one of the platforms.
Asked about the declining viewer interest in ODIs and Tests and whether that will impact Viacom18’s monetisation efforts.
""Compared to the previous cycle (2018–23), this cycle (2023–28) has a larger number of T20 matches, and T20 monetisation is quite big. There are a larger number of games against quality teams like England and Australia. That has a direct correlation to monetisation,"" he said.
Viacom18’s strategy for India cricket is to serve mobile and CTV consumers on digital and pay and free-to-air (FTA) audiences on linear TV.
As part of this strategy, the upcoming India vs. Australia series will be aired on Sports18 channel besides the TV network's Hindi and regional entertainment and movie channels like Colors Cineplex Superhits, Colors Tamil, Colors Kannada Cinema, and Colors Bangla Cinema.
""We will put India cricket on multiple channels, which will again serve the purpose of affordability,"" Jayaraj said.
On digital, the company’s streaming platform, JioCinema, will continue to have a multi-lingual presentation supplemented by multi-faceted features like multi-camera and 4K.
""It's our mission to provide high-quality, accessible coverage in an affordable manner to all Indians. Our strategy is not just providing cricket for free but also about providing high-quality coverage, whether it’s 4K or multi-cam,"" Jayaraj said.
The CEO said that he is particularly bullish about Connected TV (CTV), which currently has a reach of 40 million homes and is expected to grow dramatically in the coming years since most TV sets that are sold these days are internet-enabled.
""Connected TV is a big part of our push. IPL was viewed by about 125 million viewers on CTV, and we are hoping to build on that. We believe that the CTV base in India is 40 million, and this doesn't include people who are casting from their phones or are connecting through basic cables,"" he said.
Jayaraj is confident about the potential of non-cricket properties like the Olympics, football, basketball, badminton, and motorsports.
""Viewership numbers are very encouraging for properties like the NBA, badminton, and MotoGP. On digital, consumers can follow niche sports. It's our belief that monetisation will also catch up because people want to pay for eyeballs,"" he noted.

Zee-Sony merger: IDBI Bank files appeal against NCLT order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-sony-merger-idbi-bank-files-appeal-against-nclt-order/articleshow/103404867.cms,06-09-2023,"MUMBAI:
IDBI Bank
has moved the appellate tribunal to challenge the National Company Law Tribunal’s approval for Sony-Zee merger, a move that could delay the big-ticket deal that has been approved by stock exchanges and the Competition Commission of India.
In a disclosure to the stock exchanges,
Zee Entertainment Enterprise
Ltd (ZEEL) said the company has been served with an appeal on behalf of IDBI Bank before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
The lender has challenged
NCLT order
on August 10 granting approval to the composite scheme between ZEEL,
Culver Max Entertainment
(Sony), and Bangla Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony, which would create a $10-billion media giant.
Last month, NCLAT had admitted IDBI Bank’s petition to initiate insolvency proceedings against ZEEL over unpaid dues of Rs 150 crore. The appellate tribunal has listed that matter for hearing on October 11.
“In the objection to a scheme, the objectors as well as the tribunal have a limited role and scope,” said Ashish Pyasi, associate partner at law firm Dhir & Dhir Associates, pointing out that
NCLT
had rejected IDBI Bank’s objection as it found that “the debt is disputed”.

Cuss-words usage on OTT goes down. Do producers intend to attract a wider audience?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/cuss-words-on-ott-platforms-are-falling-are-scriptwriters-and-series-makers-exercising-restraint-to-attract-a-wider-audience/articleshow/103313912.cms,03-09-2023,"Most people tend to avoid swearing in public. Bharat Misra refrains from using
expletives
in private— when he is writing a
web series
. “I don’t remember a situation where I was not asked to reduce the number of cuss words in a script,” says the co-writer of family drama Ghar Waapsi, which released on Disney+ Hotstar last year.
When streaming players came to India in 2016, writers liberally used nudity and profanity in storytelling because there was no regulatory body to stop them. “But now there’s real concern over how content with cuss words will be received by people,” says Misra. In March, the Delhi High Court rebuked content company TVF for the “use of vulgar language” in its teen drama College Romance after someone filed a police complaint against the use of obscene language in Episode 5 of the show’s first season.
Around the same time, makers of
Rana Naidu
reportedly removed the dubbed Telugu version of the Hindi series from
Netflix
because of an unprecedented backlash over cuss words. Instances like these “have led most screenwriters to self-censor dialogue”, says Misra. The desire for a bigger audience and the fear of regulation have come to dictate just how and how often screenwriters use expletives in their scripts for web shows. Cuss words on over-the-top platforms (
OTT
) are falling, and are likely to fall further in the shows that are set to release next year, as per industry stakeholders.
Over the last four months, this reporter sampled 160 hours of content across eight popular web series and found that six of them had anywhere between 8% and 68% drop in the use of swear words in their latest seasons.
Live Events
For instance, the second season of Asur, a psychological thriller which released on JioCinema in June this year, had 62% fewer expletives than the first season that premiered on Voot (now merged with JioCinema) in March 2020. The third season of City of Dreams and Criminal Justice, both Disney+ Hotstar shows produced by Applause Entertainment, had 40-50% fewer swear words per episode compared with their previous two seasons.
Sacred Games (Netflix) and Mirzapur (
Amazon Prime Video
) are known to be the frontrunners of expletive-laden storytelling on web, but the second season of both the shows saw an 8-18% drop in average cuss words per episode.
In 2019, the pilot episode of Manoj Bajpayee-starrer The Family Man kickstarted with swear words—about 10 were uttered in the first nine minutes. However, the second season of this Amazon Prime Video show, aired in 2021, has 33% fewer cuss words per episode. Further, the recurring characters are seen using expletives in Marathi in addition to Hindi, perhaps to add an authentic flavour to swearing as well as dilute the crassness associated with most Hindi cuss words.
Ishita Moitra is surprised by these numbers. “Given that new seasons come after a gap, it’s hard to keep track, but I can say that we haven’t made a collective decision as screenwriters to use fewer cuss words,” says Moitra, screenwriter of films like Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, and web shows like Four More Shots Please!
The decline in coarse language in the recent seasonsof CriminalJustice and Cityof Dreams is “unintentional”, says Sameer Nair, CEO of Applause Entertainment. “With City of Dreams, it could be because the protagonist’s brother, a major foul-mouthed character, dies at the end of Season 1, and Eijaz Khan’s swearing cop turns into a politician in the new season,” he adds. “A shift towards a woman-focused story in a largely upper-middle class setup could be the reason for fewer swear words in the second season of Criminal Justice,” says Nair.
His observation sheds light on a “widely accepted cliche” that tough people from slightly rustic backgrounds are more likely to swear than upper middle class folks. Interestingly, Made in Heaven, a show about Delhi’s poshest crowd, has roughly 18-19 swear words per episode in both seasons, a tad more than Mirzapur Season 2. While the former is largely laced with the English F-word, the latter has most of its characters hurling Hindi slurs.
Puneet Krishna, creator of Mirzapur, says he was not asked to cut any swear words from the script of either seasons. “I think it’s because I put a lot of thought in placing the expletives in a way that they don’t feel jarring,” says the screenwriter. “Sometimes, placing the B-word (a Hindi profanity) in the middle of a sentence can mean nothing, but placing it at the end can turn a harmless sentence into an abusive one,” he adds.
In some parts of the series, Krishna used expletives to show the layers in a character. “In the last episode of Season 1, Divyenndu’s Munna bhaiya throws in a B-word to refer to a supporting character disparagingly.
In the next season, Munna shoots him dead when this character uses the same slur to insult his paternal and maternal families, highlighting that the man shouldn’t have insulted his mother’s side. It’s his way of telling the audience he only dislikes his father.”
As for fewer expletives in the second season, Krishna says it generally had a sense of gloominess to it and was, therefore, less verbose. For instance, “Ali Fazal’s Guddu cusses a lot in the first season, but only once in the second. Meanwhile, Shweta Tripathi’s Golu starts cussing in the second season as circumstances change her personality.”
However, there have been attempts at self-censoring as well. Nair says Applause recently asked one of its new writers’ team to pipe down the abusive tone of a popular character for the upcoming season of one of its shows that first aired in 2020.
A former Netflix executive, who doesn’t wish to be named, says they once asked a screenwriter to remove a lone swear word from a script to keep a PG-13 (Parental Guidance under 13) rating, instead of getting an R-rating (Restricted for children under 17 because of violence, offensive language, or sexual activity).
Two people associated with Delhi Crime told ET anonymously that the makers of the Emmy-winning show were asked to remove a few lines from its second season because of excessive use of foul language.
At 13-odd swear words per episode, the second season of this Netflix series had 70% more cuss words than the first. “But this can be attributed to a change in the writers and the director for the second season, as well as the fact that this season was far more conversational and dived into the lives of Delhi cops,” says one of the people quoted above.
Netflix India, Jio Cinema and Amazon Prime Video did not respond to ET’s emailed queries till the time of going to press. Disney+ Hotstar declined to comment.
TV VS OTT
When streaming started, it was deemed to be different from TV. “TV was always seen as an invited guest into your living room, who is supposed to conduct itself in a civilised manner,” says Nair, who had spent close to two decades in the TV business earlier. “When Bigg Boss came on TV, people were scandalised, even though cuss words were beeped out,” he recalls. With streaming, creators felt they were finally free to show skin and use abrasive language, but a lot of it was just “unnecessary”, notes Nair. “People were abusing at the drop of a hat.”
Over time, most players seem to have realised that coarse language puts more people off than it enthrals. Platforms vying for a larger market share aim to woo the “family audience” now. The buzz is that OTT wants to become “TV++”, which will require the players to shift gears from offering edgy content to a more wholesome variety. “An expanding audience puts pressure on the creators to be more courteous,” says Nair. That pressure is probably why Rana Naidu’s Telugu dubbed version had to be taken off air.
Says BVS Ravi, a screenwriter in the Telugu film industry: “You normally have a small pocket of viewers watching regional content on OTT, but Venkatesh and Rana Daggubati are such superstars here that the regular audience was keen to watch the show as well.” Ravi wrote the screenplay of Rana Naidu as well as its Telugu translation for dubbing. “I think people weren’t able to accept their superstars, especially a veteran actor like Venkatesh, using cuss words,” he adds. “It’s like Shah Rukh Khan uttering swear words in a movie. Can you imagine how the fans will react?”
WHY ON EARTH?
There’s scientific literature that talks about the benefits of swearing for stress relief as well as its adverse effects on one’s mental health. In streaming, though, cuss words largely help writers express the peak of a character’s emotions.
Roughly 44% of coarse language sampled across these shows was a form of self-expression, used to show anger, frustration, shock, or excitement. It was not meant to abuse someone.
In the new cartel comedy on Netflix India, Guns & Gulaabs, Dulquer Salmaan’s Arjun Varma, who plays a cop, utters a Hindi cuss word while talking to Satish Kaushik’s foulmouthed gangster Ganchi. “Instead of directly abusing Ganchi, he says that he uses the B-word to tell his friends off,” says Sumit Aroraa, one of the writers of the Netflix show. “In doing that, he maintains the decorum of his office, by not swearing back at Ganchi, while simultaneously showing him that he is an equal rival and not some newbie cop he can overpower.”
To that extent, cuss words also help in establishing a power dynamic between two people. Which is why content where women swear doesn’t go down well with a lot of folks, “because it shows women in a position of power that a lot of people find hard to digest,” says Moitra of the Rocky Aur Rani fame. In her scripts, she uses them sparingly “because most cuss words denigrate women”. At the same time, she also hopes there won’t be any unnecessary policing of language. “You have to use them if the milieu of the show demands it. If I’m watching Mirzapur, I am expecting bad words, not poetry!”

Bankruptcy court grants RP's request for immunity due to 'unintentional delay' in ND's Art World resolution process,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/bankruptcy-court-grants-rps-request-for-immunity-due-to-unintentional-delay-in-nds-art-world-resolution-process/articleshow/103294469.cms,02-09-2023,"MUMBAI: The bankruptcy court allows ND’s Art World’s resolution professional’s (RP) application to grant him immunity from any potential action for ‘unintentional delay’ in being able to take necessary steps as required to be performed under the Code (
IBC
) during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) of the company.
Mumbai-based ND’s Art World was promoted by celebrated art director
Nitin Desai
, who allegedly committed suicide after the company was admitted under the CIRP by the National Company Law Tribunal.
Thereafter, an FIR was filed against the senior officials of
Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company
Ltd and Edelweiss Group along with the company’s interim resolution professional.
Subsequently, the company’s IRP
Jitender Kothari
, through his lawyer Nausher Kohli approached the tribunal to seek immunity against any action by the lenders or the disciplinary committee of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) for any ‘unintentional delay’ in the matter.
The tribunal, in its order of August 28 observed that a police case for abetment of suicide under IPC came to be registered in this matter consequent upon suicide by one of the suspended directors of the corporate debtor on the ground that the initiation of CIRP proceedings caused him to commit suicide.

“Due to this, there seems to be an atmosphere of outrage in the area nearby the offices of the corporate debtor and the same are also under the control of Police Authorities for investigation purposes,” observed the division bench of Justice Virendra Singh Bisht and a technical member Prabhat Kumar. “We consider that the facts brought to our notice can be taken on record to safeguard the office of the resolution professional, and in particular, the likelihood of any proceeding against him for negligence in the discharge of his duties under the Code in relation to CIRP process.”
On July 25, the NCLT’s Mumbai bench appointed Kothari as the IRP after ordering the initiation of CIRP against ND’s Art World over its Rs 252 crore debt following two loans totalling Rs 181 crore.

Section 10A mandates no application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) can be filed against any debtor by any financial and operational creditor for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020, for a period of one year.
This was a special provision inserted by the government in IBC to help the companies after the economic activities had resumed post-lockdown in phases.
The NCLT said Section 10A bars absolutely and forever, the filing of any application under Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Code, for defaults committed on or after March 25, 2020, up to March 25, 2021.
Siti Networks has taken a loan of Rs 150 crore for a working capital facility and as per the agreement, it has to maintain a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).
On March 5, 2021, IDBI Bank invoked the guarantee provided by ZEEL and called to pay Rs 61.97 crore with further interest from February 18, 2021. It claimed an amount of Rs 149.60 crore in default.
This was contested by ZEEL contending that its guarantee provides for a limited and restricted liability on the guarantor and cannot be held liable for the entire debt in case of default by the borrower at
Siti Bank

The relaunch is set to provide a boost for Singapore-based Sea, which is trying to reverse slowing sales growth amid intensifying competition. New Delhi in February 2022 banned Free Fire, at the time Sea’s most popular mobile gaming title in the country, citing security concerns because of its Chinese links. Weeks later, Sea said it would shut its main e-commerce operation in India, blaming “market uncertainties” for scuppering one of its more promising overseas endeavors.
India has banned hundreds of Chinese apps in recent years, but the expansion of that policy to Sea last year took management and investors by surprise. Sea was founded by Forrest Li, who was born in China but is now a Singaporean citizen. China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. is a shareholder in Sea.

""We are on the lookout for the right partners and if they add some value, then we're very open to considering it. For example, if they can help us get locations in five cities, then it's a no-brainer,"" he added.
In fact, the company was very close to setting up its third KidZania centre in Bengaluru prior to Covid-19. However, the landlord's decision to change in plan post-Covid meant that the company had to look for an alternative location to set up an indoor theme park. Once the company finalises a location, it takes 18 to 24 months to fit out a kid's area.
""We're in touch with many of the premier landlords and mall owners. We're looking for locations right now in Bengaluru. After Bengaluru, our plan is to look at Ahmedabad, Pune, Hyderabad, and Chennai,"" Chandaria added.
KidZania, which has three revenue streams: ticketing, brand partnerships, and F&B, had an annual revenue of $10 million pre-Covid. However, the pandemic had taken a toll on the company's revenue as footfalls saw a sharp reduction and many of the brand partners backed out.
Sanjeev Kumar
, KidZania India's chairman of the Advisory Board, said that the company will hit $10 million in revenue over FY24 and FY25 as footfalls grow and the company inks partnerships with new brands.
""We expect footfalls to come back to pre-Covid numbers. Our increase in brand partnerships will take us approximately two years to really come back to those numbers,"" he added.
KidZania president and CEO Xavier Lopez Ancona said the Indian market is extremely important for the company due to its huge population.
KidZania
, which has 29 centres globally, gets almost 7.5% of its global footfalls from India. ""We're going to hit 100 million visitors in September, and of that, 7.3 million will come from KidZania in India,"" Ancona added.
Imagination Edutainment has a multi-year franchisee partnership with KidZania.

indoor theme park
KidZania has set sights on further expansion in the country by adding 7-8 new centres during the next decade, a top company official said on Wednesday. Some of these centres might be smaller,
KidZania
India Founder and Promoter Paras Chandaria said, adding that if smaller formats become successful, these can be replicated in Tier-II cities going forward.
""We see huge opportunities in
India
and expect to open 7-8 theme parks in the next 8-10 years,"" Chandaria told PTI.
""Now, we are looking at five cities -- Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad -- for the next phase of expansion with a capex of USD 50 million (about Rs 400 crore),"" Chandaria said.
""In the next 8-10 years, India will become the largest market for KidZania in the world, surpassing Mexico which has four centres. Similarly, we will also explore Tier-II markets with high children population for further expansion,"" Chandaria added.
KidZania is headquartered in Cuajimalpa city of Mexico.

Currently, there are two KidZania centres in India -- one in Mumbai and another in
New Delhi
-- and the total footfall has crossed 7 million in the last 10 years.
About footfalls in India as compared to pre-Covid levels, Chandaria said the momentum is back and he hopes that the 2019 levels would be reached by the next calendar year.
KidZania President and CEO
Xavier Lopez Ancona
, who is in India to celebrate 10 years of the brand's presence here, said the country has great potential for growth and throughout its journey has maintained strong brand partnerships that have contributed to collaborative success.
Kidzania has a strong pipeline globally and is opening a centre in Hanoi this year and will open one each in Hong Kong and Johannesburg next year, he added.

Pocket FM to double down on investment,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pocket-fm-to-double-down-on-investment/articleshow/103092987.cms,27-08-2023,"Audio entertainment
platform
Pocket FM
is looking to double its investments to ₹328 crore in creating original audio entertainment content, with one of its shows Insta Millionaire earning over ₹82 crore in revenue and 10 other shows earning more than ₹8 crore, a top company executive said.
""We aim to double down on our content investments to ₹328 crore. Our target is to expand our content library by 5X in the next 12 months,"" Pocket FM CEO and co-founder
Rohan Nayak
told ET.
He also said that the company plans to spend 20% of its
annual recurring revenue
(ARR) on content creation. Pocket FM is looking to achieve ₹820 crore in ARR by the end of 2023.
""The only reason we would want to raise funding is to spend on content,"" Nayak said, adding that the company is always in conversations with investors to raise funds.
To date, Pocket FM has raised $109.5 million from marquee investors like
Silicon Valley Bank
, Lightspeed India Partners and
Tencent
, among others. Pocket FM has upped the pace of content creation by 50% in the last six months. ""For us, content investment is not cash burn but capex. You are trading an asset that will give you returns over the next five years,"" explained Nayak.
Live Events
He claimed that the platform's revenue will triple in the next 12 months. ""We are expected to surpass $300 million in ARR by 2024,"" Nayak said.
While audio platforms are known for music streaming and podcasts, Pocket FM sees a massive opportunity in creating audio entertainment shows akin to their video streaming counterparts.
Unlike
video content
, audio content doesn't require huge investments, irrespective of the genre of the show, noted Nayak. It has built a library of 1,000 audio entertainment series, both exclusive and co-owned.
Pocket FM derives a majority of its revenue from micro-transactions, with just 8% of the revenue coming from advertisements. The average time spent on the platform is 110 minutes per user.

"ZEEL's Punit Goenka moves SAT, seeks a stay on SEBI's confirmatory order",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zeels-punit-goenka-moves-sat-seeks-a-stay-on-sebis-confirmatory-order/articleshow/103062279.cms,25-08-2023,"Zee
Entertainment Enterprises Limited (
ZEEL
) MD and CEO
Punit Goenka
has moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal (
SAT
) against the Securities Exchange Board of India's (
SEBI
) confirmatory order barring him and his father
Subhash Chandra Goenka
, the entertainment company's Chairman Emeritus, from holding any directorship or managerial position in any listed company or their subsidiaries.
The ZEEL chief has prayed that the capital market regulator’s order be set aside. The hearing in the matter is likely to take place on August 30. Earlier, the
Goenkas
had challenged SEBI's interim order dated June 12 before SAT, which refused to grant any immediate relief to the duo.
Incidentally, only Punit has moved the SAT against the confirmatory order, according to multiple sources involved in the matter. He has approached the appellate tribunal through the law firm Economic Laws Practice (ELP).
SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch's August 14 order prevents Goenka from becoming the MD and CEO of the Sony-Zee combined entity until the regulator concludes its investigation in the alleged fund diversion case against them.
In an earlier interim order dated June 12, the SEBI issued a similar order against the father and son following allegations of fund diversion from ZEEL to other Essel Group companies without seeking board approval.
Live Events
The regulator had also said that it would complete the probe against ZEEL promoters within eight months from the date of issuance of the order. Punit was to serve as the MD and CEO of the combined firm for five years.
The merger deal between ZEEL and Culver Max Entertainment (Sony) has received all the requisite approvals, including those from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the Competition Commission of India (CCI), the Bombay Stock Exchange, and the National Stock Exchange.
“I note that a detailed investigation in the matter is in progress, which may bring out additional acts of omission or commission of the entities, if any, in detail, depending on the material and after considering the facts and veracity of their submissions,” Buch had said in her 91-page order. ""The findings in the extant order are prima facie findings in a matter under investigation.""
On July 27, SAT modified its earlier order dated July 10 and directed SEBI to appoint another Whole-Time Member (WTM) to consider the objections of Goenkas and pass further orders in the case.
The SAT had ordered SEBI that if no WTM is available, then it may appoint any authorised officer higher in grade, rank, or position than the WTM to decide the matter against the Goenkas.
The appellate tribunal had passed the order following an application by SEBI on July 24 requesting the appellate tribunal to modify its July 10 order and allow the market watchdog to appoint Ananth Narayan G or any authorised officer to consider the objections of the Goenkas and pass further orders.
In its order, the SAT also noted that the person who is appointed as WTM will have to fix a date for a hearing within a week from the date of filing of the reply by the Goenkas and pass appropriate orders within two weeks after giving them an opportunity to put forth their arguments.

is one of the most recognizable names in the music business for his singular work as an executive and entrepreneur. He's managed many of your favorite artists, propelling the likes of
Justin Bieber
to stratospheric fame, and earned the ire of

On Friday, rumors circulated online that Justin Bieber was leaving Braun, his longtime manager - and the man credited with discovering him. In the days that followed, speculation grew, and media outlets began reporting that some of Braun's other hype-profile clients like
Ariana Grande
, and
Demi Lovato
were also parting ways with him - all of which has yet to be confirmed.
Braun hasn't issued a public statement, but did tweet in jest, writing ""Breaking news... I'm no longer managing myself.""

As the story continues to unfold, here's everything we know - and everything we don't - about what's going with Scooter Braun and his powerful client roster.
Who has Scooter Braun managed? Without confirmation from artists, their teams, or Braun himself, changes to Braun's roster are conjectural. AP reached out to every artist listed as being managed under Braun's company, SB Projects, on their official website and only heard back from a select few.

A person familiar with SB Projects' business dealings, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told the AP the artists on the company's roster have day-to-day managers who are not Braun, and he consults with them. The person noted that no single person would be able to manage his roster of some of the biggest names in music on their own.
The site mentions his company's ""past and present work"" and includes artists Braun no longer works with, including Hilary Duff and
J Balvin
.
Representatives for Carly Rae Jepsen, BabyJake, and Asher Roth confirmed to AP that those artists no longer work with Braun and haven't for quite some time.
A person close to Idina Menzel told AP the singer is no longer managed by Braun but was not authorized to speak publicly.
A representative for pop star Ava Max confirmed that she is still represented by Braun.
OK, but why is Scooter Braun a big deal? In the early 2000s, Braun dropped out of Emory College to throw parties for elite musicians traveling to Atlanta: Ludacris, Eminem, even Britney Spears. Jermaine Dupri recruited him to become So So Def's executive director of marketing. Later, in 2007, Braun started his own talent management company, SB Projects, where in 2008, he'd discover Justin Bieber on YouTube, growing the teen heartthrob's profile by utilizing social media.
SB Projects encompasses a few ventures: Management, which included clients like Bieber, Ariana Grande, J Balvin, and for a short-stint, Kanye West; Sheba Publishing, a joint venture with Universal Music Group Publishing; and Schoolboy Records, a record label first put on the map by Braun's client Asher Roth and his 2009 hit ""I Love College.""
Braun operated his assorted companies under one entity called Ithaca Holdings.
In the midst of his incredible success, in 2019, Braun bought Big Machine Records, the label that originally signed Taylor Swift and released her first six records. Its CEO Scott Borchetta stayed in place. With the purchase, Braun purchased ownership to Swift's master recordings, which he sold to an investment fund the following year. As a result, Swift announced that she would re-record her albums to own her new masters in a project called ""Taylor's Version.""
In April 2021, Braun sold Ithaca Holdings to HYBE - the publicly traded company formerly known as Big Hit Entertainment, best known for creating the K-pop group BTS - in a $1.05 billion deal. According to the corporate filling, Braun would receive about 462,380 shares of the company (totaling $86.2 million) while his star clients Grande and Bieber would each receive 53,557 shares, or almost $11.0 million apiece.
In January 2023, he became the sole CEO of HYBE America, having previously shared the title after the merger with Big Hit's Lenzo Yoon.
Back up - what is Braun doing with HYBE? When Braun's Ithaca Holdings merged with the globally minded HYBE in April 2021, it became one of the largest music companies in the world. Just a few months later, in July, Bang Si-hyuk, the CEO of Bit Hit Entertainment/HYBE stepped down, Park Ji-won took over, and Lenzo Yoon and Scooter Braun were named co-CEOs of HYBE America. In January, Braun became the sole CEO - which means he's busy.
There has been speculation that if Braun's artists are leaving SB Projects management, it is because Braun is slowly placing his focus on HYBE America instead of acting as an artist manager. But so far, there's been no confirmation that's what's happening.
What does a music manager do? The role of a music manager is an elusive one, based largely on the kind of relationship between the businessperson and the musician. The best music managers - and we're excluding business and tour managers here, whose specialties are in the title - are fiercely organized, dedicated to the success of their artist. They possess a deep understanding of the industry and the artist's place within it.
They work to ensure their artist's projects run smoothly, connecting teams to reach a particular goal. Think of them as the behind-the-scenes engine responsible for allowing the artist to succeed. Often, they invest in and help develop an artist, and tackle anything from creative production to day-to-day operations.

Gadar 2 and OMG 2 debuted in theaters on August 11, while Jailer was released on August 10.
The film industry had last week reported record-breaking gross box office receipts of ₹390 crore and attendance of 21 million from August 11 to 13.
According to the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) and Producer's Guild of India (PGI), the box office collection was the highest ever in the Indian film industry's history, while the combined audience admissions were the highest in the last 10 years.
""While this kind of weekend with a gross box office of ₹390 crore and 21 million footfalls is rare, I believe that if done smartly, there is a potential to have at least 5-6 such weekends like Diwali, Eid, Independence Day, Republic Day, Christmas, and New Year where we have the potential to generate ₹400 crore in gross box office revenue,"" said Zee Studios CEO Shariq Patel.
Gadar 2, which was made at an estimated budget of ₹80-90 crore, has proven to be a significant cash cow for Zee Studios since it has complete IP ownership. ""The box office stimulus will help the industry plough money back into the business,"" Patel said.
MAI president Kamal Gianchandani said the total footfalls would have easily crossed 35 million for the industry. ""We were always sure that once the regular flow of Hindi movies began and the stories were interesting, viewers would return. To keep the momentum going, we need more of these movies.""
Taran Adarsh, a trade specialist in the Bollywood industry, said that the momentum from last week has been maintained this week. ""All three films, Gadar 2, Jailer, and OMG 2, are creating new milestones at the box office. It augurs well for the film industry because the pre-pandemic days are back. The overall euphoria that was missing from the industry is back. It's a great time for the industry.
He also observed that all three films, besides being great entertainers, have seasoned movie stars who are defying age. ""None of these three films have new-generation stars, and all three - Rajinikanth, Sunny Deol, and Akshay Kumar-have brought in huge numbers at the box office. Never underestimate the stardom of these superstars,"" Adarsh said.
Shibasish Sarkar, who is the president of the Producers Guild of India, said the film industry is on a turnaround path as millions of audiences across metros, Tier 1, Tier 2, and small towns have flocked to the cinemas to watch films.
""However, one word of caution is that an industry cannot sustain itself with a few blockbuster films doing bumper business in a year. It's 52 weeks of programming and sustenance. So, we need to see and wait for audiences to come back to theatres for even medium and small-budget films, which used to happen pre-Covid. I am reasonably confident that we will see such acceptances very soon,"" he noted.

Rajinikanth's Jailer notches up two more box office records as it crosses Rs 500 crore mark,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/rajinikanths-jailer-notches-up-two-more-box-office-records-as-it-crosses-rs-500-crore-mark/articleshow/102876597.cms,20-08-2023,"Rajinikanth
's 'Jailer' has notched up two records on its way to grossing Rs 500 crore at the box office. Trade analyst Manobala Vijayabalan in a post on social media platform X said 'Jailer' has grossed Rs 500 crore on the 10th day of the release, making it third film from Kollywood to enter this club after
2.0
and
Ponniyin Selvan.
'Jailer' is the second fastest film of Kollywood to enter this club after
2.0.
In another post on X, Manobala Vijayabalan said that 'Jailer' has created new record by becoming the third film from Kollywood to cross $20 million at the overseas box office, after
2.0
and
Ponniyin Selvan.
2.0 -
in just 10 days, the analyst wrote.
Commenting on the magic of 'Jailer' at the box office, another trade expert Ramesh Bala said: ""Rajinikanth is a Superstar. The 'Superstar' tag alone is enough to garner it all the attention it needs. And then, he also benefits from worldwide recognition.""
Rajinikanth's persona in the movie is that of an old jailer hunting down a notorious gang lord and mercilessly eliminating his gang members.
Rajinikanth today offered prayers to Lord Hanuman at Ayodhya. The actor's visit comes at a time when his film 'Jailer' is performing well at the box office. Earlier, Rajinikanth met Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister
Yogi
Adityanath at his residence in Lucknow.

box office collection
between August 11 and 13, marking the busiest single weekend for the industry post the re-opening of cinemas after the pandemic. The Multiplex Association of India (MAI) and Producers Guild of India (PGI) noted that the ₹390-crore gross box office collection is possibly the biggest ever for a weekend in the industry's history.
The two industry bodies also revealed that the weekend drew over 21 million to theatres across the country, which is the highest combined admissions record in the last 10 years.
The box office collections were driven largely by films like

According to Sacnilk, Jailer has raked in over ₹150 crore in net box office collection till Sunday while Gadar 2’s three-day net domestic box office collec tions were over ₹134 crore. OMG 2 and Bhola Shankar’s net collections stood at over ₹43 crore and ₹26 crore, respectively. Jailer released on August 10 while Gadar 2, OMG 2 and Bhola Shankar released on August 11.

Live Events
“Audiences are responding in numbers we have not seen for a very long time; even the early morning shows are getting sold out.
This weekend has been a wonderful experience for people who love mainstream Indian films,” he added.
MAI president Kamal Gianchandani said the footfalls and gross box office collections have set new records in the film industry. “This whole debate that audience behaviour has changed and the audiences have been weaned away from cinemas to streaming platforms has clearly proven to be incorrect,” Gianchandani said.
He said that the long weekend, coupled with the aggressive push by the studios in marketing the films, has played a key role in increasing footfalls. “The cinema exhibition industry has benefited greatly in the last three days. Multiplexes and single screens have operated at 70% occupancy in the last few days, irrespective of which part of the country they are situated in,” Gianchandani said.
He is also confident that the after-effects of the pandemic are over and admissions will grow further as filmmakers have lined up an aggressive content slate for the second half of the year.
During the company's Q1 earnings call,
PVR Inox
MD Ajay Bijli said the multiplex chain has been seeing a consistent month-on-month increase in collections.
""Volatility in Hindi film performance has reduced, and we have seen a QoQ improvement in average collection of Hindi films as well,” he said.

“It is essential that we elevate the standards of creating and consuming Indian content. Our country is home to numerous languages, each possessing its own unique power and potential that remains largely untapped,” said Akshay Bardapurkar, Founder and CEO of Planet Marathi Group.

With the launch of Planet Bharat, we strive to create a unified one stop destination, where audiences across the globe can enjoy and embrace the diverse cultural heritage that India has to offer, he added.
Planet Marathi already owns a

multiplexes
and cinema halls witnessed a record number of admissions driven by movies such as 'Gadar 2', 'Jailer', 'OMG 2' and 'Bhola Shankar', boosting their combined gross
box office collection
to over Rs 390 crore. This weekend set a ""new all-time theatrical gross box office record"" in its 100 years of history, said a joint statement from the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) and Producers Guild of India (PGI).
""The weekend drew over 2.10 crore moviegoers to theatres across the county, which is the highest combined admissions record in the last 10 years of history,"" it said.
The weekend of August 11 to 13 was the busiest single weekend post re-opening of the cinema industry after the Covid pandemic.
""The turnout at theatres has infused a new energy in our industry, audiences are responding in numbers. We have not seen for a very long time, even the early morning shows are getting sold out,"" said PGI President Shibasish Sarkar.
He further said: ""This weekend has been a wonderful experience for people who love the mainstream cinemas.""
Live Events
MAI President Kamal Gianchandani said this was a ""historic weekend"" for the cinema exhibition industry and it proves once again that India loves to go to movie halls to watch good movies.
""This weekend is also an undeniable demonstration of cinemas being the ultimate place to be part of shared experience,"" he said.
Gianchandani further added he expects this momentum to continue for the rest of 2023.
MAI represents more than 11 cinema chains, operating over 500 multiplexes and 2,500 screens in India, which is around 75 per cent of the multiplex industry of India.
PGI is a
premier
association of film, television and digital content producers in India.
The cinema exhibition industry underwent financial distress during Covid. The operation was suspended for over a year during the pandemic due to safety precautions. It was severely hit by the restrictions.
Later in early 2021, it was allowed to run at half capacity only with several riders, which financially impacted the industry further.
The industry had to face those restrictions after the successive waves of the pandemic in some regions also.
Moreover, in the absence of theatrical premiers, several producers had also started to move towards OTT platforms.
However, the industry fought back with a good content pipeline.

OTT content in line with IT Rules: Lobby groups tell MIB,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ott-content-in-line-with-it-rules-lobby-groups-tell-mib/articleshow/102669623.cms,12-08-2023,"Two of India’s leading over-the-top (OTT) industry
lobby groups
have told the government that their
OTT
platforms are ensuring compliance with
IT Rules
even before the content is published.
The
Indian Digital Media Industry Foundation
(
IDMIF
) and the
Internet and Mobile Association of India
(IAMAI) have, in separate but identical letters, to the ministry of information and broadcasting (
MIB
) said that OTT platforms have agreed to go through a thorough process to ensure that the content they produce is in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the IT Rules 2021. The rules describe OTT platforms as online curated content platforms (OCCPs).
The lobby groups also said that the OCCPs are taking precautions to make sure that none of the content they create has an adverse effect on India's sovereignty, integrity or security, is harmful to India's good ties with other nations, incites violence or interferes with the maintenance of public order.
The two organisations have said that, given the diversity of India, every OCCP is exercising due caution and discretion when highlighting the actions, convictions, customs, or opinions of any racial or religious group.
""We would like to reiterate that the OCCPs are committed to producing world-class content in India and promoting India as a global content hub as envisioned by both the prime minister of India and the information and broadcasting minister, while also accounting for the sensitivities and cultural nuances of the country,"" said the letters.

""In addition, we would like to restate the fact that OCCPs are fully committed to complying with the Code of Ethics laid down in the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021,"" the letters added.
According to IDMIF and IAMAI, each OCCP will take the responsibility to sensitise the creators and producers about the Code of Ethics in order to ensure that creators and producers are cognisant of various nuances while creating a film, series or documentary.
The OCCPs, based on their assessment, will consult experts on delicate subjects related to the portrayal of social issues, minority communities and religious groups. The experts may include academics, lawyers, judges, campaigners and business executives in related fields.
The letter follows meetings that the MIB held with OCCPs on July 18 and June 20 regarding concerns about the presence of vulgarity, abusive language and violence in
OTT content
.
During the meeting with OTT platforms on July 18, I&B minister Anurag Thakur expressed concerns about vulgarity and obscenity in OTT content.
Incidentally, the MIB had not invited IDMIF and IAMAI representatives to the meeting with the minister. However, the OCCPs have decided to respond to the MIB through their respective industry bodies and not individually.
IDMIF and IAMAI have chosen a common policy to allay the worries of MIB with regard to OTT content, despite being two independent SRBs under the IT Rules.
MIB secretary Apurva Chandra, while referring to the meeting held with the OTT platforms and their SRBs on June 20, felt there is a need to strengthen internal regulatory mechanisms and due diligence in respect of the suitability of the content showcased by OTT platforms.
The SRBs formed by IDMIF and IAMAI have 42 OTT platforms as members. IAMAI has 32 members, including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hungama and ShemarooMe, while IDMIF has 10 members, namely JioCinema, SonyLIV, Disney+ Hotstar and ZEE5, among others.
Additionally, IDMIF and IAMAI have pledged to strengthen the self-regulatory mechanisms by educating members about their roles and responsibilities as OCCPs, advising platforms on age ratings, providing age rating advisories, raising awareness of access controls, conducting awareness campaigns and overseeing review procedures.
IDMIF, which has been formed by Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF), also has a self-regulatory body (SRB) under the IT Rules, called Digital Media Content Regulatory Council (DMCRC). IAMAI's SRB is called Digital Publisher Content Grievances Council (DPCGC).
The IT Rules have mandated a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism for OTT content. The OTT platform examines the complaint against a content property in the preliminary stage. An industry organisation is responsible for investigating it at the second level. The third stage is where MIB receives the complaint.

NCLAT dismisses appeal to investigate PVR-INOX merger,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/nclat-dismisses-appeal-to-investigate-pvr-inox-merger/articleshow/102598788.cms,10-08-2023,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Thursday dismissed the appeal filed by Consumer Unity and Trust Society, a think tank, asking the
Competition
Commission of India to investigate the
PVR-INOX merger
.
The senior counsel for CUTS had argued that given the merged entity controls over half of the screens in the country, the merger could have an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC), which could be detrimental to consumers.
On the other hand, the senior counsel representing the merged entity, also made a party to the case, had contended that the mere existence of a dominant position could not be the basis of alleging abuse of the dominant position.
CUTS had pointed out that the Competition Commission, in an earlier case, had not allowed
PVR
to acquire DT Cinemas in specific locations earlier, as it would have led to a monopoly in those regions. It had demanded a similar relief, contending that the PVR-INOX merger hampers competition in 46 markets nationwide.
The counsel for CUTS relied on European jurisprudence to argue that investigation could take place in matters of dominant positions regardless of threshold. The counsel cited examples from France and Belgium.

The PVR-INOX merger was under the threshold limit of CCI to probe such transactions owing to depressed revenue from Covid.
In September 2022, CCI passed orders rejecting the CUTS application, stating that apprehension of the likelihood of anti-competitive practices by an entity cannot be the subject of a probe.
PVR and
INOX
Leisure announced their merger on March 27, 2022. The combined entity controls over 1,600 of the 3,200 screens across the country.

Ormax to now test documentaries through its streaming testing tool,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ormax-to-now-test-documentaries-through-its-streaming-testing-tool/articleshow/102567765.cms,09-08-2023,"Media insights company
Ormax Media
has upgraded Ormax Stream Track, their
streaming
content testing tool, to test
documentaries
as well. The tool has been used to test 214 web series, direct-to-OTT films, and OTT reality shows since 2016.
The company stated that 14
Indian documentaries
have been released on major streaming platforms in
India
since the start of 2022. Additionally, several international documentaries are beginning to find traction in India, suggesting that the documentary genre is gaining more interest in the Indian market.
The upgrade identifies nine key drivers of content engagement for documentaries among Indian audiences: knowledge, credibility, authenticity, theme relevance, Theme uniqueness, suspenseful narrative, surprise and amazement, emotional heft, and Inspiration.
Like all content testing done by Ormax Media in streaming, theatrical, and television domains, the company reports the Ormax Power Rating (OPR), a number on the 0-100 scale that is a strong predictor of the likely audience engagement when the property being tested is eventually released.
Ormax Media’s testing tools,
Ormax Stream Test
,
Ormax Moviescope
, Ormax First Draft, and Ormax True Value, use an analytics tool that assigns weightages to different drivers and fuses primary research data collected from the audience with these weightages to calculate the OPR.

TRAI seeks views on regulating DD Free Dish,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/trai-seeks-views-on-regulating-dd-free-dish/articleshow/102547579.cms,09-08-2023,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
TRAI
) has kicked off a consultation exercise on issues related to the
TV broadcasting
sector, in which it has also asked the stakeholders if
DD Free Dish
, the free
direct-to-home
(DTH) platform owned by
Prasar Bharati
, needs to be brought under the regulatory framework.
The regulator has asked the TV broadcast industry to give their views on upgrading DD Free Dish to an addressable platform. The TRAI has also requested input from stakeholders about the migration process for DD Free Dish to become an addressable platform as well as the timeline for implementing the proposed migration plan.
Currently, DD Free Dish is a non-addressable platform as the majority of the set-top boxes (STBs) through which its service is accessed are unencrypted. The TRAI's tariff and regulations don't apply to DD Free Dish since it is a free platform.
The distribution platform operators (DPOs) have been lobbying for years with the government to regulate DD Free Dish, which has become a distribution giant and is estimated to reach over 40 million TV homes.
During the recent auction, Prasar Bharati earned over Rs 1000 crore in annual carriage fees from the sale of 65 slots of DD Free Dish to the broadcasters.

DD Free Dish, along with over-the-top (OTT) platforms, has been eating into the subscriber base of pay-TV service providers like Tata Play,
Dish TV
,
Airtel
Digital TV,
Hathway
Digital, DEN, and NXT Digital. These service providers are collectively referred to as DPOs by the TRAI.
According to the FICCI-EY report, TV subscription revenue declined for the third year in a row in 2022 as the pay-TV universe saw a decline of five million homes and consumer-end ARPUs (average revenue per user) remained stagnant.
The regulator has also sought views on whether pay channels available on DD Free Dish channels should be made available as FTA channels across all platforms. Currently, certain channels that are listed as pay channels on private distribution platforms are also available as FTA channels on DD Free Dish.
ET reported in March that the regulator would come out with a consultation paper that would discuss issues like a ceiling on network capacity fees, multi-TV connection tariffs, carriage fees, and a level playing field with regard to the pricing of TV channels.

Last year, the regulator amended the new tariff order (NTO) by reinstating the old price cap of Rs 19 per channel and doing away with the ‘twin conditions’ in its amended tariff order. The decision was taken to placate the broadcasters, who were unhappy with the frequent changes being made to the NTO regulations.
The consultation paper titled Regulatory Framework for Broadcasting and Cable Services delves into issues related to tariffs, interconnection regulation, and quality of service (QoS).
The issues in the consultation paper have been framed based on the inputs received from industry bodies like the Indian Broadcasting & Digital Foundation (IBDF), the All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF), and the DTH Association.
Among the other issues put up for consultation, the TRAI has asked stakeholders to provide comments with justification if the present ceiling of Rs 130 per month on the network capacity fee (NCF) is reviewed and revised.

The TRAI has also asked whether DPOs should be allowed to have variable NCF for different channel packages in different geographical areas. NCF is charged by the DPOs to consumers every month.
It has also asked the stakeholders to provide comments if there is a need to review the discount cap on the sum of the MRP of a-la-carte channels in a bouquet. The regulator has also asked if the revenue share between a multi-system operator (MSO) and a local cable operator (LCO) needs to be relooked at.
The authority also sought to determine if there is a need to remove the cap on carriage fees that are charged by DPOs to broadcasters. The TRAI has also asked if a financial disincentive should be levied in case a service provider is found in violation of the TRAI's norms for the broadcasting sector.

is mulling increasing the incentives offered to international production houses for
filming
in the country and also grant one-off perks for big-ticket films.
Last year, the government unveiled an incentive scheme for audio-visual co-production where the Indian co-producer can claim a cash reimbursement of up to 30 per cent on qualifying expenditure in India, subject to a maximum of Rs 2 crore.
Information and Broadcasting
Secretary
Apurva Chandra
on Tuesday said the government is considering increasing the quantum of incentives as it realised that other countries are offering more attractive perks for filming.
""We will reveal the quantum of increase shortly, the proposal is under consultation within the government,""
Chandra
said at the CII Summit FX–4th Global

Chandra said the government was also considering hosting a separate international animation film festival soon.
To encourage the animation sector, the government, as an initial effort, will have a segment dedicated to the fast-emerging sector at the International Film Festival of India in Goa, he said.
Chandra said animation, visual effects, gaming and comics (AVGC) formed 20 per cent of the media and entertainment sector in the country and was growing fast.
Film production markets such as the US, Canada and the UK offer programmes at the national level as well as state and provincial levels.
Emerging markets such as Middle East and Africa -- the UAE, Jordan, Morocco and South Africa -- have started deploying production incentives to jump-start local content development, given markets there are still nascent.
Chandra said the National Centre of Excellence for AVGC will be set up with larger participation from the private sector.
""The National Centre for Excellence will have CII-FICCI as stakeholders with 52 per cent stake and 48 per cent government stake,"" he said, adding that the centre will be developed on the lines of Invest India and was expected to operated as a catalyst to develop the sector and attract investments.
Atul
Kumar Tiwari, Secretary, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, said the government has made great inroads in creating skilled talent in the AVGC sector with around 55 universities in India now offering courses in animation and 38 in VFX.
Tiwari said India was focusing on developing future skills, and AVGC as an integral part of this strategy.
Also, as part of the National Education Policy-2020, the government is making efforts to integrate AVGC into school curriculum in order to identify and train talent from an early stage.
Asking the industry to create globally local content, Tiwari said that India has so much to offer to the world through its stories and we are moving in the right direction.
Biren Ghose, Chairman, CII National AVGC Committee, said that the sector has the potential to grow three times its current size in the next five years.
Ghose said that the AVGC sector was experiencing a number of trends including emergence of Generative AI, and was coming out of its dependence on TV commercials.

What type of brands or companies usually get involved here?
Vijay Subramaniam:
Today, there is a creator out there for any genre or sector that exists and we have a wide range of brands and companies from various industries which include fashion and beauty brands, technology companies, consumer goods manufacturers, food and beverage companies, travel and hospitality businesses, and many more. The versatility and reach of creator driven content make it appealing to a diverse array of businesses aiming to engage their target audiences in an authentic and relatable manner.
What is the creator economy size in India at the moment and how do you that growing?
Vijay Subramaniam:
At the moment, the creator economy in India is experiencing rapid growth and has already become a significant player in the country's digital landscape. Globally, there are over 200 million creators and India is set to have the largest base of social media
content creators
with the figure crossing 100 million this year, according to a report by influencer marketing firm Zefmo and it continues to expand due to several factors including the increasing number of content creators, rising social media penetration, a surge in digital content consumption, and the willingness of brands to allocate more of their marketing budgets to influencer-driven campaigns.
How sustainable will the creator economy be, if AI begins to do the job that influencers are doing?
Vijay Subramaniam:
It’s still early days for AI and I feel confident that the sustainability of the creator economy will endure, despite the potential influence of AI in content creation. While AI can certainly automate certain aspects of content generation, human creators bring unique perspectives, creativity, and relatability that AI cannot replicate fully. Creators establish authentic connections with their audiences, fostering trust and loyalty, which is challenging for AI to achieve. Additionally, the landscape constantly evolves, and creators adapt by exploring new content formats and platforms, ensuring their relevance and value to brands and followers.
How will you monetise from
Big Bang app
?
Vijay Subramaniam:
It’s a straight-forward platform fee on all transaction done via the app.

MCA examines SEBI's allegations against Zee Ent: Report,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/mca-examines-sebis-allegations-against-zee-ent-report/articleshow/102418355.cms,04-08-2023,"The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) is examining irregularities in
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
as alleged by the market regulator SEBI, ET Now reported on Friday. However, the company is not aware of any
MCA
probe and has not received any such notification from the ministry, news agency Reuters said citing a source.
The MCA has taken cognizance of the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) interim order which alleged bogus book entries and siphoning of funds, and is probing lapses in corporate governance issues, the report added, citing sources. However, the MCA has not issued an inspection order, the report added.
In the interim order on June 12, Sebi barred Subhas Chandra and ZEEL MD Punit Goenka from holding the position of a director or key managerial personnel in any listed company for siphoning off funds of the media firm. Both Chandra and Goenka moved SAT seeking a stay on the Sebi order, citing injustice.
In a letter to employees, Goenka reportedly said that the merger of
ZEE Entertainment
and Sony has reached an advanced stage of completion, and the issues faced by promoters with Sebi should not become a problem for the company.
With the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) restricting him from holding a directorial or key managerial position in a listed company, Goenka told the employees that the ZEEL board has constituted an interim committee of senior executives to ensure smooth operations and day-to-day functioning.

"Amazon, Google wooed by India for $750 million cricket rights",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/amazon-google-wooed-by-india-for-750-million-cricket-rights/articleshow/102344958.cms,02-08-2023,"India’s cricket governing body is trying to lure global giants
Amazon
.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. to bid in a media rights auction of its team’s games amid waning interest from firms who had recently competed fiercely for the wildly successful Indian
Premier
League.
The proposed starting date of the auction process for the media rights of the so-called bilateral series, played by the Indian team against other countries, for the next five years is postponed by at least two weeks as the
Board of Control for Cricket in India
reaches out to more firms to drum up interest in the property, according to people familiar with the matter.
The lukewarm response by media firms ahead of the auction highlights the struggle to make money amid weak advertising revenues, with the shorter-format
IPL
being the top cricket property garnering higher viewership over the years. The sale process is running two weeks behind a timeline suggested by its adviser, Ernst & Young, under which auctions would have been completed by August end, they said.
EY expects the sale of rights to 102 matches to raise at least $750 million, almost the same price for what it was sold five years back, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. In contrast, the rights to IPL, which was auctioned last year, had surged almost threefold from the previous offering.
The IPL remains one of the world’s most popular sporting contests and is still garnering the most eyeballs among cricket events. Last year,
BCCI
raised record amounts of money by selling media rights for the IPL through an auction as Viacom
18 Media
Ltd., controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and Walt
Disney
Co. outbid rivals, including Sony Group Corp.

Robert Oppenheimer's legacy as an American hero was fully restored last December, when the
US government
overturned its 1954 decision stripping him of his security clearance.
Lewis Strauss, the man behind Oppenheimer's fall, remains covered in disgrace. In fact, 'Oppenheimer', the film, may have sealed his fate as a villain for history.
Strauss (played by
Robert Downey
in 'Oppenheimer') passed away in 1974, and Oppenheimer (played by
Cillian Murphy
) passed away in 1987.
The two men had disagreed on hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer lobbied against it arguing atomic bombs are enough. Strauss argued for the thermonuclear bomb as a deterrent against the Soviet Union.
Strauss, as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, the top nuclear agency at the time, was opposing the decisive break during a congressional hearing on the export of isotopes.

Oppenheimer did not only support it, but appeared to have mocked Strauss in his testimony as chairman of AEC's General Advisory Committee. He had said: ""No one can force me to say that you cannot use these isotopes for atomic energy. You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do. You can use a bottle of beer for atomic energy, in fact you do. But to get some perspective, the fact is that during the war and after the war, these materials played no significant part, and in my knowledge, no part at all ... My own rating of the importance of isotopes in this broad sense is that they are far less important than electronic devices but far more important than, let us say, vitamins, somewhere in between.""
Strauss was enraged, enough to begin plotting to take down Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer's troubles, however, went back further. To the 1930s, in fact, when he flirted with left-wing causes while heading up a department on quantum mechanics the University of California, Berkeley, where he was before heading up the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in New Mexico.
He attended meetings of the Communist Party USA, whose members included his wife Katherine Oppenheimer Vissering (played by Emily Blunt in the Oppenheimer film), brother Frank Oppenheimer and his wife Jacquenette Yvonne Quann. FBI opened a file on him after he came on their radar as they were surveilling known members of the communist party.
One of these contacts -- not his family -- pitched Oppenheimer an offer to pass over information to the Soviet Union when he was heading the Manhattan Project. He declined the offer.
But a British scientist who had access to the Los Alamos project was actually spying for the Soviet Union and may have passed on critical information.
The Soviet Union tested an atom bomb in 1949, four years after Oppenheimer-led Manhattan Projects first test of an atom bomb in July 1945. A few months later two of these bombs -- named Little Boy and Fat Man -- were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And he ended the second world war,
At the peak of the a phase in US politic called the ""second red scare"", Oppenheimer was told by Strauss, who was now the chairman of the AEC, in late 1953 he had been stripped off his security clearance.
Oppenheimer appealed, triggering a highly partisan hearing in which his lawyers were denied information available to the other side on grounds of their lack of clearance. At the end, Oppenheimer was held patriotic but untrustworthy.
Strauss had had his victory.
But a few years later, that sham hearing caught up with him and at the worst time in his career, when he was up for confirmation as President Dwight Eisenhower's nominee for secretary of commerce.
He was rejected, primarily on the testimony of a scientist (played by Rami Malek) about Strauss' role in bringing down Oppenheimer.

"Disney Star seeks premium rates from advertisers for ICC CWC, Asia Cup",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/disney-star-seeks-premium-rates-from-advertisers-for-icc-cwc-asia-cup/articleshow/102116668.cms,26-07-2023,"MUMBAI: Disney Star-owned sports broadcaster
Star Sports
and streaming platform Disney+ Hotstar have released rate cards for advertisers for the upcoming
Asia Cup
and
ICC Cricket World Cup
.
Star Sports is asking for Rs 120 crore for co-presenting sponsorship and Rs 90 crore for associate sponsorship opportunities for the World Cup. The broadcaster is asking spot buyers to pay a premium rate of Rs 31 lakh per 10-seconds for India and knockout matches.
The sports broadcaster aims to secure Rs 26 crore for co-presenting sponsorship and Rs 20 crore for associate sponsorship for the Asia Cup while seeking spot buy rates of Rs 25 lakh per 10 seconds for India vs. Pakistan as well as the final match.
""
Disney Star
will make every effort to capitalise on both events. It is counting on a variety of factors, including the festive season, India vs. Pakistan matches, and the ICC World Cup taking place in India after 12 years, to work in its favour,"" said a top ad sales executive.
Industry watchers said that a lack of ad spending by startups coupled with the levy of 28% GST on gaming companies might upset the media company's ad revenue targets. Gaming has become one of the key advertising categories with annual ad spends by gaming companies estimated at $1 billion.

Anurag Thakur expressed his displeasure over the CBFC's failure to safeguard the interests of the public, emphasizing that such negligence cannot be overlooked. He asserted that the board members would be held responsible for their actions, signalling a clear message of accountability.
This major development comes as the government takes measures to uphold public sentiments and ensure responsible content in the Indian film industry. The demand for accountability from the CBFC reflects the government's commitment to maintaining a robust and responsible film certification process.
Earlier, the Information Commissioner of the Union government, Uday Mahurkar, also voiced his misgivings over the scene and hit out at the filmmaker.
Speaking to ANI on Sunday, Mahurkar said, ""It's (the scene) an insult to Bhagavad Gita, which is our holy book. It sends out powerful and meaningful messages to the entire world. How could someone demean it this way? The scene is an assault on our values and civilisation. It's an assault on the Hindu community.""
Further, calling on Nolan to delete the offensive scene from the film, he added, ""Nolan should remove this scene from the film. It reeks of religious hatred. If he doesn't take out the scene, we will act,"" he added.
On Saturday, Mahurkar, also the founder of Save Culture, Save India, took to Twitter to say the scene is a scathing attack on Hinduism.
“It has come to our notice that the movie 'Oppenheimer' contains a scene which makes a scathing attack on Hinduism. As per social media reports, a scene in the movie shows a woman making a man read Bhagwad Geeta aloud while indulging in sexual intercourse. She is seen holding a copy of the Bhagwad Geeta in one hand,"" he wrote.
He added, “We do not know the motivation and logic behind this unnecessary scene in (a film based on the) life of a scientist. But this is a direct assault on (the) religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus.”
“We urge, on behalf of billion Hindus and the timeless tradition of lives being transformed by revered Geeta, (the makers) to do all that is needed to uphold the dignity of our revered book and remove this scene from the film across the world. Should you choose to ignore this appeal, it would be deemed as a deliberate assault on Indian civilisation. Eagerly await needful action,"" he said.
He added that he wants the matter investigated by top officials and ministers, including Union Information and Broadcast Minister Anurag Thakur.
Mahurkar said,""This should be investigated by the I&B Ministry on an urgent basis and those involved should be severely punished. As observed by Union I&B Minister Anurag Thakur-ji recently and even by our courts in the last couple of years, what we get in the name of entertainment is often insensitive to our culture and the sentiments of our people.""
The biopic, set during World War II, follows Robert J Oppenheimer, known as the 'Father of the Atomic Bomb'.
The film has a topline cast comprising Cillian Murphy in the title role, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, and Jack Quaid.
The movie was released in theatres on July 21.

’s film about J. Robert
Oppenheimer
, the man known as 'the father of the atomic bomb,' has angered many Indian movie-goers due to the reference of
Bhagavad Gita
during an intimate scene. Many have taken to Twitter , wondering how the censor board cleared the scene.
""One is perplexed as to how the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) could approve the movie with this scene. A divine gift to human civilisation by Bhagwan Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Geeta, is one of the most revered scriptures of Hinduism. Geeta has been the inspiration for countless sanyasis, brahmcharis and legends who live a life of self-control and perform selfless noble deeds,"" Government of India's Information Commissioner Uday Mahurkar tweeted, sharing a statement from Save Culture Save India Foundation.
""We do not know the motivation and logic behind this unnecessary scene on life of a scientist,"" the statement read. ""A scene in the movie shows a woman makes a man read Bhagwad Geeta aloud while getting over him and doing sexual intercourse.""
The scene in question is where the main character Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) quotes a line from the Bhagavad Gita while making love to Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh).
Save Culture Save India Foundation in the release further said: ""We believe that if you (Christopher Nolan) remove this scene and do the needful to win hearts of Hindus, it will go a long way to establish your credentials as a sensitized human being and gift you friendship of billions of nice people.""
Live Events
""We urge, on behalf of billion Hindus and timeless tradition of lives being transformed by revered Geeta, to do all that is needed to uphold dignity of their revered book and remove this scene from your film across world,"" the statement said.
Some Twitter users have called for a boycott of the movie. ""I’m calling for a boycott of the movie Oppenheimer. I just learned there is a highly offensive scene involving the Bhagavad Gita in it. I will not repeat it here, but it involves something explicit,"" said an user.
— UdayMahurkar (@UdayMahurkar)
Though Christopher Nolan focuses on focuses on the Manhattan Project during World War II which led to the bomb, and America's subsequent interest in nuclear program policy in the years post the war, 'Oppenheimer' also dives into the physicist's personal life.
According to reports, 'Oppenheimer' is director Christopher Nolan's first R-rated movie in 20 years. But in India, the censor board gave the film a U/A rating, after the studio cut some scenes to reduce its length, news reports said.
India's censor board had also recently come under focus after some users pointed to controversial dialogues in the movie 'Adipurush' . The producers of 'Adipurush' later made some changes to the dialogues amid criticism for disrespect towards the Hindu epic Ramayana.

Oppenheimer
and Greta Gerwig's fantasy comedy film
Barbie
grossed over Rs 22 crore in domestic box office collections on their opening days of release in India.
Oppenheimer, which cost $100 million to make, outperformed Barbie, which cost $150 million, in domestic collections on the first day. Oppenheimer's opening day take is Rs 17.5 crore, while Barbie's collection is Rs 5.3 crore, according to figures given by
Warner
Bros. Discovery, the distributor of both films in India.
Both films were released on July 21 (Friday) amid high expectations from the film fraternity that they would attract audiences back to theaters. The gross domestic box office collection for the first half of 2023 dropped 15% YoY to Rs 4,868 crore, as per Ormax Media.
Globally, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal's Universal Pictures is the distributor for Oppenheimer, while Warner Bros. is the distributor for Barbie. In India, Warner Bros. is distributing both films since Universal Pictures shut its India operations in 2020.
""We have had a stupendous response to the first weekend bookings of both Oppenheimer and Barbie, both of which have their own unique set of audiences,"" said Gautam Dutta, Co-CEO,
PVR Inox
.
Live Events
He also stated that all IMAX shows for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer on the PVR Inox circuit are sold out. ""We have scheduled shows as early as 3.45 am to accommodate as many shows on IMAX so that Nolan fans do not miss out on the action for the movie shot on IMAX format,"" Dutta said.
The PVR Inox Co-CEO went on to say that the multiplex chain's premium screen formats like P[XL] and BIGPIX had above-average occupancies of more than 55%. ""Considering Oppenheimer is also dubbed in Hindi, we are seeing a wider viewership of the movie beyond the metros.""
He also stated that Barbie, which falls in a different genre, has drawn family audiences cut across generations with average occupancies beyond 45%. He added that the movie has been well received in the ICE Immersive format, which features LED panels on each side of the auditorium.
Both movies are generating huge word-of-mouth customer reviews, and what is extremely encouraging is that they are not choosing to watch either of the two movies but preferring to watch both, which is translating to occupancies beyond 60%,"" he added.
Producer and film business analyst Girish Johar said both films are expected to exit the opening weekend with combined collections of close to Rs 70 crore. He estimated that Oppenheimer's opening weekend collection may be Rs 50 crore, while Barbie's would be Rs 17 crore.
Elara Capital SVP Karan Taurani, Oppenheimer, and Barbie's lifetime domestic box office collections are anticipated to reach Rs 70–80 crore and Rs 40–50 crore, respectively.
Even though Oppenheimer has eclipsed Barbie in India, the scenario is the opposite globally. Barbie earned $41.4 million in 51 regions worldwide, while Oppenheimer earned $15.7 million in 57 markets, according to Deadline.

""Having high-budget shows has never been our strategy, and that is not necessarily what younger audiences are looking for. Short-form and snackable content is our focus area,"" Marvis said.
The company recorded revenues of over Rs 140 crore from the Indian market for the year ended December 2022, with a large chunk of its revenue coming from TV broadcasting.

""TV is still dominating our revenue in India because
costs per thousand
(CPMs) on television remain much higher than digital. At some point in time, digital revenue and digital distribution, inclusive of CTV, will become the dominant part of our business, but that is going to take time,"" he stated.
In India, Qyou Media owns and operates a Hindi entertainment channel called The Q, as well as multiple digital content destinations across multiple genres. Recently, it launched a spiritual channel with Sadhguru on CTV. It also owns a direct-to-consumer platform, Q Play.
Apart from TV and digital media, Marvis is also bullish about the influencer marketing and gaming categories. It had acquired a 97% stake in influencer marketing agency Chtrbox for Rs 38 crore and a 51% stake in mobile gaming company Maxamtech Digital Ventures for Rs 2.9 crore, with the option to acquire the remaining 49% in tranches by 2026. It has since increased its stake in Chtrbox to 98%.
""We have put all the pieces together to build a growing media company with a focus on younger audiences,"" Marvis stated. ""If you are building a media brand, then you need to be reaching users in all the different places that they appear.""
Qyou Media's programming library in India comprises over 1300 shows. In 2022, it produced over 1300 hours of programming, compared to 400 hours in the prior year.
Bennett Coleman and Company Limited's strategic investment arm,
Brand Capital
, had invested in Qyou Media. BCCL also publishes The Economic Times.
Marvis said Qyou will continue to pursue an ad-driven business model in India. ""If you want to create value in India, you need to be mass, and to be mass, the product should be free,"" he stated.

Sony-owned Crunchyroll plans to grow its investments in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/sony-owned-crunchyroll-plans-to-grow-its-investments-in-india/articleshow/102033749.cms,22-07-2023,"Sony

Crunchyroll, which is the world's largest anime content platform, is looking to make significant investments in India as part of its global expansion plans, a top company executive said.
Crunchyroll President
Rahul Purini
said the company will invest in content, localisation, platform, and hiring talent. ""We will build offices in the country as we continue to invest here. We are considering multiple locations,"" he said.
Crunchyroll operates as an independent organisation globally, even though it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation. In India, Sony Corporation also owns and operates the media network,
Sony Pictures Networks India
(SPNI).
Sony acquired Crunchyroll in 2021 and later merged it with its streaming service Funimation to build a united platform. The platform has 150 million users globally and 11 million paying subscribers.
""India is the second-largest anime market in the world after China, and it is growing very fast,"" Purini said. ""In the regions where we are present, India would be the largest market in terms of potential audience. We expect 60% of the global anime growth to come from India.""

He also stated that India has 180 million anime fans, with 53 million watching anime content from official sources. The audience for anime content is typically in the 13–24 age group, with 60% of the audience being male and females comprising the rest.
An average anime viewer spends 60 minutes watching anime content. Some of the popular sub-genres within the anime genre include action-adventure, romance, comedy, and slice-of-life shows.
Desi Flavour
While Crunchyroll earlier dubbed content in English, the platform has now started dubbing content in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu.
""We have over 35 Hindi dubs on the platform and have also started releasing Tamil and Telugu dubs. Going forward, we will dub content in multiple languages,"" Purini said.
In India, Crunchyroll has a dual revenue model that combines advertising and subscriptions.
It has three subscription plans priced at Rs 79 per month, Rs 99 per month, and Rs 999 per year.
""India is a value-conscious market, which is why we have both SVOD and AVOD options. However, SVOD has a lot of potential in India from a business point of view as well as offering a unique fan experience,"" he stated.
The platform recently appointed Tiger Shroff and Rashmika Mandanna as brand ambassadors.
Currently, Crunchyroll India has 500 series, comprising 1700 episodes and 3800 hours of content. The platform's global library comprises 46,000 episodes or 24,000 hours of content.
""In India, we are adding 20 to 30 shows every quarter. These are brand-new shows made in Japan. Globally, we are acquiring 40 to 60 shows a quarter, or about 160 to 200 shows a year,"" he added.

Netflix's password sharing curbs could lift its subscriber base in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/netflixs-password-sharing-curbs-could-lift-its-subscriber-base-in-india/articleshow/101994259.cms,21-07-2023,"Netflix's decision to clamp down on
password sharing
in India might help the streaming giant boost its subscriber base in the country, even though there is a high possibility that the platform could see a drop in shared access viewers in the short term, say media analysts.
According to industry estimates, Netflix's paid base in India hovers between 8 million and 10 million.
In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it will start to address account sharing between households in almost all the remaining countries, including India.
The platform will not be offering an extra member option in India since it cut pricing in the country in December 2021.
Netflix declared that it added almost 6 million paid net additions for the three months that ended June after the platform clamped down on password sharing beginning May in over 100 countries, which represented more than 80% of its
revenue
base.
Live Events
""This is a good move to shore up subscriptions in India. Netflix will surely gain subscriptions even though they might lose some shared access viewers in the short run,"" said Uday Sodhi, senior partner, Kurate Digital Consulting, a digital transformation and strategy consulting firm.
A senior media analyst said on condition of anonymity that password sharing and
piracy
are rampant in the Indian market. The analyst expects Netflix to gain incremental subscribers due to restrictions on password sharing.
""There is a gap between their active user base and their actual paid base, which means that there is a lot of password sharing and piracy. It's early days to make a prediction, but the clampdown on password sharing will help them get incremental subscribers in India,"" he added.
Elara Capital SVP Karan Taurani said the crackdown will have a positive impact on Netflix's subscriber base, but the quantum of the positive impact may not be as high as in mature markets globally since India is a price-sensitive market.
""If you have two or three families that are sharing a password, you will see instances where some customers might go for fresh subscription, but because the market is price sensitive, you might also see instances where the customer unsubscribes from the platform and eventually resorts to watching content on pirated platforms,"" he added.
NV Capital managing partner Nitin Menon said Netflix faces the twin challenges of password sharing and piracy since its subscription plans are very expensive for an average Indian consumer. He feels that the platform needs to revisit its pricing strategy in India.
""Netflix needs to be more flexible with its pricing strategy since India is a price-sensitive market. Their subscription plans have always been priced at a premium compared to other OTT platforms,"" he added.
Starting July 20, the streaming platform said that a Netflix account can only be used by one household, and everyone living in that household can consume content wherever they are. It stated that family members can also take advantage of new features like Transfer Profile and Manage Access and Devices.
Netflix's paid member base in India increased in 2022 as the price of its monthly plans was reduced. The platform decreased the cost of its mobile plan from Rs 199 to Rs 149.
Netflix's basic plan was decreased from Rs 499 to Rs 199, while the standard plan was reduced from Rs 649 to Rs 499. The premium plan's price has been reduced from Rs 799 to Rs 649.
In an earlier interaction with ET,
Netflix India
VP for content Monika Shergill said that the platform has seen a 30% growth in content consumption, while its revenue grew 25% year over year.
According to Netflix Entertainment Services India’s financial data, sourced by
Tofler
, the company ended FY21 with gross revenues of Rs 1,529.36 crore.

Flash movie as NFTs sparks excitement and skepticism,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/flash-movie-as-nfts-sparks-excitement-and-skepticism/articleshow/101966023.cms,19-07-2023,"Warner

NFT
(Non-Fungible Token). With immersive web3 experiences,
the Flash
NFTs will offer fans the opportunity to watch the movie in 4k Ultra HD and access exclusive content, artwork, and augmented reality experiences.
The NFTs come in two versions, the ""mystery"" edition priced at $35 with 10,000 copies, and the ""premium"" edition priced at $100 with only 2,000 copies available, Warner Brothers said in a statement.
The Flash collectible release is the third in the Warner Bros Movieverse. Fans will be able to resell their NFTs from 1 August 2023.
""What we’re seeing happen is a perfect example of NFTs being novel asset classes. Also not for the first time, recognised brands and names are used to unlock a range of new market opportunities, whilst giving its fans the opportunity to engage deeply with what they love, and benefit from it at the same time” says Andras Kristoff, CEO and Co-Founder of Singapore-based Galaxis, the platform behind many celebrity NFTs.
“When we engage with big brand celebrities; the goal isn’t to create a collection that’ll just be bought and traded for profit. It's to allow fans to develop deeper connections, own a membership card, utility card, NFT, whatever you want to call it, and unlock money-can’t-buy experiences with it. This is precisely what companies, brands, influencers and celebrities are trying to achieve with the technology,” Andras said.

Star India
, has gotten interim relief from the
Madras High Court
following their plea against the
Google
Play Store's new billing system. Novi Digital owns and operates India's leading streaming app Disney+ Hotstar.
In an interim order on Tuesday, the Madras High Court restrained Google from delisting the Disney+ Hotstar streaming app from its official app store. It has also asked Novi Digital to pay a 4% commission to Google on the downloads through the Play Store.
Novi Digital, which is the fifteenth company to challenge the Google Play Store's new billing system, moved the HC yesterday. The matter, however, came up for a hearing today. The company refused to comment on the Madras HC verdict.
Earlier, Matrimony.com, People Interactive,

, Catchup Technologies,

Novi Digital was represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Satish Parasaran, who argued for a similar interim arrangement between Disney+ Hotstar and Google Play Store as the other petitioners in the case.

The Madras High Court had passed an interim injunction directing Google not to delist apps owned by the petitioners from the Play Store while asking them to pay a 4% commission to the tech giant for the app downloads.
Novi Digital argued that the new billing policy does not give app developers enough options because they must offer Google Pay as a payment option even if they use a third-party payment gateway.
""Under the new billing system, the app developers have to pay an 11% fee to Google Pay even if they opt for a third-party payment system. Prior to the CCI order, Google Pay was the only default payment option for app developers and they had to pay a 15% fee,"" said a lawyer connected with the matter.
ET had earlier reported that Google had issued a notice to Novi Digital for using a non-Google Play billing system and had threatened to remove the streaming app from the Play Store.

Ormax
Media's The
India Box Office Report
, the cumulative India
box office
collection for the first half of the calendar year is Rs 4,868 crore (gross), which is 15% lower than the same period in 2022.
At this rate, the report stated that 2023 is predicted to end with a box office of Rs 9,736 crore, which is 8% less than the annual box office of Rs 10,637 crore in 2022. Ormax Media uses Gross Box Office as the unified measure for this report.
However, it added that the second half of 2023 features a good lineup of films that are predicted to perform well, particularly Jawan, Salaar, and Tiger 3. This puts the year on track to surpass, or at least come close to, the 2022 gross box office.
Pathaan
is the top film in the first half of 2023, accounting for more than 13% of the year's total collections.
The Hindi language now accounts for 37% of the total, up from 33% in 2022, while Kannada has dropped from 8% to 2%. The share of
South Indian
films has dropped from 50% to 44%, largely because of a steep drop in Kannada's share.
Live Events
Adipurush
, despite multiple controversies and poor audience likability, takes the second spot on the strength of its huge opening in the Telugu and Hindi markets. Fast X is the only Hollywood film to feature in the top 10 films list at the end of June 2023.
According to the report, the box office crossed the Rs 1,000 crore mark in June 2023, thanks to the robust opening of multilingual Adipurush and the creditable box office performances of Zara Hatke Zara Bachke (Hindi), Carry On Jatta 3 (Punjabi), Baipan Bhaari Deva (Marathi), and Maamannan (Tamil).
This makes June 2023 the second-best box office month of the year, after January, which was fuelled by Pathaan's phenomenal box office performance.
The Indian film industry's box office collections reached an all-time high in 2019, totaling Rs 10,948 crore, followed by 2022, the only other year in which the Rs 10,000 crore mark was exceeded.

"Yudiz to soon launch IPO; eyes gaming studio to power up revenue levels, Chairman says",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/yudiz-to-soon-launch-ipo-eyes-gaming-studio-to-power-up-revenue-levels-chairman-says/articleshow/101852118.cms,18-07-2023,"Blockchain, AI and gaming focussed enterprise solutions technology player
Yudiz
is aiming to go public in coming weeks and plans to ramp up offerings with the proceedings. The company is planning to spend Rs 12.31 crore to boost core offerings by looking at acquisitions across India, USA, Canada and Europe. In an exclusive interaction with ET Online’s Gourab Das,
Bharat Patel, Chairman and Director at Yudiz,
sheds light on India ambitions,
gaming studio
, acquisition plans and more. Edited excerpt:
What is the status of your IPO and isn’t now the right moment to launch the initial share sale given that the markets are red hot?
Bharat Patel:
We are looking at the IPO to come up during this month end or the first week of next month. That is the tentative time we have chosen, but there is no exact fixed date yet.
Your IPO proceeds will go for acquisitions and to build gaming studios, according to the DRHP. But can you please elaborate what these gaming studios are going to be about and what acquisition strategy do you have?
Bharat Patel:
One portion from IPO proceeds will be on development of the gaming studio and the other one will be for the gaming platform, these are the two areas which we will primarily look into. The IPO proceeds are not the only source that we are aiming to use, because we have already started work and have already spent money. The proceeds will augment that further. The gaming platforms will not only have our own games but even games which have been developed by others will be available.
Live Events
As for acquisitions, it will be more to do with upgrading or complimenting our skill sets, which are not there existing with us. So, we may not outsource a type of work in future and rather acquire companies. That is the kind of acquisition that we are looking into.
Will the IPO proceeds be enough for your plans?
Bharat Patel:
We are a self-funded company. We are debt free at the moment. We have not taken any money from any other place, nothing from the bankers or any of that sort. It has been self-funded so far and we are looking at the proceeds to augment our existing plans.
Given that many smaller gaming companies are feared to find it tough to survive with 28% GST, will you be looking at some of them for acquisitions?
Bharat Patel:
We are open to it. That is where the opportunity is going to be for us, that is going to be a good opportunity for us.
You have plans for a gaming studio and aim to produce over 40 games in a year. Will all of them focus on mobile platforms?
Bharat Patel:
Yes, primarily mobile platforms. The internet bandwidth is improving and in the coming days it is going to be even better. The cost of internet is also becoming pretty low. So, I think mobile devices are going to become the key area where most of the games are going to be. However, we are not restricting ourselves. Even web based ones are also going to be there because the code is in our hand and we are going to replicate it accordingly.
Also, this is our internal target that we have set across. The games will be more in the casual, hyper-casual or mid-core genre. 40 games is a bare minimum that we are going to have per year.
Can we say that you are moving towards being a B2C player?
Bharat Patel:
Yes, certainly.
What is your current turnover and how much will the gaming studio contribute to your top line?
Bharat Patel:
Last year our turnover was about Rs 27.8 crores. When I talk about the gaming studio, as far as Yudiz is concerned, that would almost constitute 50% of our revenues. These games would not necessarily be our own games. They will be games which are developed for others. But moving forward, we are creating this white label and we will be creating our own products. So, the studio and the platform will take over this entire turnover, which will go to much higher levels in the coming years.
What is the gaming behaviour you are noticing these days?
Bharat Patel:
With the internet coming so cheap, the spending of time on a mobile has drastically increased. From around 2.5 hours per week it will go almost to seven hours in the next couple of years and this will be focused largely towards the gaming arena. Gaming is becoming an item which will be consumed by every client. IPL reportedly may earn the stakeholders almost Rs 2,200 crore. On other hand the fantasy gaming cos’ collection in this IPL season was Rs 2,800 crore.
What is the average paying threshold of an online gamer?
Bharat Patel:
Frankly speaking, I have no clue on what is the average amount that people would be spending. However, majority in India are still the non-payers. They would play the free games. Still, around 2.1 million gamers are active, who are spending money.
I also believe there will be a shift to paid gaming and that has already started in a very big way.
Is there a shelf life for games?
Bharat Patel:
Normally what happens is a game does not have a shelf life of its own, but it is a trend, and the trend would keep changing. There are some games which are very simple, but they are long lasting.
Approximately by when will you launch the games?
Bharat Patel:
I believe that this should not be taking up more than 18 to 20 months timeframe because we have already started the works. A lot of games have already started and some more will be up by this March. But the platform will take a little longer because it needs a lot of testing. So that will take time, but of course less than two years for sure.

PVR reduces prices on food & beverage after tweet of exorbitant popcorn bill goes viral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pvr-reduces-snacks-prices-after-tweet-of-exorbitant-popcorn-bill-goes-viral-offers-bottomless-popcorn/articleshow/101715975.cms,13-07-2023,"Responding to widespread criticism regarding the exorbitant prices of snacks at its multiplexes, cinema chain
PVR Inox
has announced the introduction of two offers on snacks and drinks, claiming it is an ""unbeatable price"". The announcement comes after a journalist highlighted the bill of an average-sized popcorn and Pepsi at a PVR cinema hall. In an attempt to address the issue, PVR said it has introduced two offers.
""PVR has introduced two food combos starting from Rs 99 from Monday to Thursday between 9 am and 6 pm, while on weekends it has offered ""bottomless popcorn"" with ""unlimited refills"" and ""bottomless Pepsi"", the company said.
According to offer details available for its 'Bestseller @ 99', the offer is not applicable for group bookings or special shows, and could be purchased offline only. The combo will also not be available in any of its luxury cinema formats like LUXE/Gold and TLC cinemas as Director's Cut.
The controversy began earlier this month, when a journalist shared a photo of his bill from
PVR Noida
, showcasing the exorbitant prices he paid for a regular-sized tub of cheese popcorn and a same-sized Pepsi. In his social media post, he highlighted how the cost of these snacks was nearly equivalent to an annual subscription of Amazon Prime, expressing concern over the affordability of movie outings with family.
“Rs 460 for 55 gm of cheese popcorn, Rs 360 for 600 ml of Pepsi. Total Rs 820 at @_PVRCinemas Noida. That’s almost equal to annual subscription of @PrimeVideoIN. No wonder people don’t go to cinemas anymore. Movie watching with family has just become unaffordable,” Tridip K Mandal said on Twitter and Instagram.

Kevin Vaz
has formally joined Viacom18 as the CEO of its TV business, sources privy to the development have said. He was previously the head of the entertainment business at Disney Star. His last day at the company was June 13.
Kevin's mandate will be to drive the company's overall TV business, which comprises almost 38 channels across multiple genres including general entertainment, movies, regional, and kids. In addition to this, he will also spearhead the regional content and marketing for the digital business.
Two people familiar with the matter said that the announcement about Vaz's appointment was made at a town hall meeting on Monday.
The town hall happened in the presence of
Reliance Jio
chairman Akash Ambani, who joined through video conference, and Uday Shankar, who is now on the board of Viacom18 following Bodhi Tree Systems' stake acquisition in the company.
Viacom18 didn't offer any comments until the time of filing this report.

Sources further state that
Jyoti
Deshpande, who is the CEO of Viacom18, will transition out of this role to focus exclusively on Jio Studios as its head. Deshpande is also the President of
Reliance Industries

Currently, Anil Jayaraj is the CEO of the sports business, while Gourav Rakshit is the COO of the digital business.
One of the sources tracking the developments said that the company intends to rope in a separate CEO for the digital business comprising
JioCinema
. Viacom18 is merging its streaming platform Voot with JioCinema.
""Viacom18 will eventually have separate CEOs for TV and digital businesses,"" the source said on condition of anonymity.
Vaz has worked with Disney Star (earlier
Star India
) for more than 20 years and has held a number of important roles, including CEO of the regional entertainment business and head of ad sales.
In April, Viacom18 got a cash infusion of Rs 15,145 crore following the completion of the strategic transaction involving
Reliance
Industries, Bodhi Tree Systems, and Paramount Global after the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the merger scheme.

Game over: Indian gaming companies fear thousands of job cuts after GST increase,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/indian-gaming-industry-will-be-killed-gaming-companies-after-gst-rise/articleshow/101675948.cms,12-07-2023,"The recent decision by the
GST council
to increase indirect taxes on
online gaming
today will ‘kill
India
’s online gaming industry and will render thousands unemployed,’ said the companies.
“Imposing GST on CEA will render the legitimate online gaming industry unviable, effectively driving consumers towards offshore and illegal platforms that pay no taxes, resulting in loss of taxes and outflow of foreign exchange. Further, this will also lead to loss of employment for thousands working in this sector,” said Bhavin Pandya, Co-founder, Co-CEO, Games24x7, one of the country's top fantasy sports platforms.
The GST Council, headed by
Union Finance
Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman
, gave a nod to levy 28 per cent GST on online gaming, horse racing and casinos at full value at the 50th meeting of the apex body on indirect taxes.
Group of Ministers (GoM) in their previous meeting broadly agreed on the proposed taxes on the said activities, however, there was no consensus on online gaming as Goa proposed to impose only 18 per cent tax on platform fees.
Indian gaming industry raised $ 2.8 billion from domestic and global investors combined in the last 5 years said Invest India.

28% GST on online gaming 'unconstitutional, irrational, egregious', says industry
""This development indicates an increase from 1.8 rupees per 100 rupees spent on a game to 28 rupees on per 100. This will not only discourage players from playing, the professionals for whom its a livelihood will be burdened by taxation. It may also force them to play on offshore platforms, and the whole vision of creating a digital progressing gaming ecosystem seems blurry at this point,"" said Ms. Shivani Jha, Tech Policy Lawyer and Director, EPWA (E-Gamers and Players Welfare Association).
Another player in this market said that the decision is a ‘self-goal’ of the council to kill the industry.
“GST on GGV is a self-goal that will kill India's Skilled Online Games industry. Today's decision at the GST Council is not in national interest as it will destroy a significant portion of the successful companies in India's Start-up Ecosystem,” said Amrit Kiran Singh, Chief Strategy Advisor to the Founders,
Gameskraft
.
Singh added that the decision will support foreign companies which at the same time will lead to the death of the domestic gaming market.

“USA and China are the market leaders with 23 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. This is a borderless industry and over-taxation in India will only support the cause of the overseas gaming companies and encourage Indian industry to migrate overseas,” said Singh.
Meanwhile, listed player
Nazara Technologies
said in an exchange filing that the tax, once implemented, will apply only to the skill-based real money gaming segment of their business, whose contribution to the company's overall consolidated revenues for the financial year FY23 was 5.2%.
""To the extent required, the Company will proactively take steps to mitigate any potential impact to this segment of our business, and we anticipate minimal impact to our overall revenues,"" it said.
The council has argued that there should be no distinction between 'game of skill and game of chance.’

Life is a reel: How a tech ecosystem is equipping people with tools to turn mundane moments into filmi short videos,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/life-is-a-reel-how-a-tech-ecosystem-is-equipping-people-with-tools-to-turn-mundane-moments-into-filmi-short-videos/articleshow/101601674.cms,08-07-2023,"Janhavi Jain admittedly “sucks at making reels”. Yet, three out of 10 posts on her
Instagram
account happen to be in that video format. “Instagram makes them for me,” says the 24-year-old
marketing
professional from Delhi. “Every time I’m putting up a story or multiple pictures, the app prompts me to turn them into a reel. It even throws in suggestions of trending audio tracks to go along with the video, tempting me to give it a try.”
Jain enjoys the process. “Now I find myself shooting random moments when I’m doing the most regular things like typing on the laptop,” she says. “I save/bookmark audios on the app to use later when I have a fitting moment to go with it,” she adds. When turned into a reel with a song in the background, even an ordinary day in her life seems rather extraordinary, she says. “I feel like the main character of my movie.”
This is the magic of the digital La La Land. Every
social media
platform is luring its users into becoming a “content creator” so that people spend more time on the app. In an attention-deficit world of endless scrolling, this has led to the rise of a tech and app ecosystem that makes editing and uploading
short videos
seem like child’s play. This incentivises amateurs or “non-creators” to post content in a way that makes them feel like a movie star, even if nobody shows up to watch the movie. Jain, for instance, does not post “vlog-style reels” with the intention of becoming a content creator with millions of followers. She does it because “it enhances the sensory experience of my memories and that feels great”. Divija Bhasin, a counselling psychologist from Delhi, says we tend to remember memories with a bias in our minds. “Things that are mundane can be seen as beautiful or sad depending on our current situation.” On reels, however, “the bias comes from the text, the effects and the music,” she says. Bhasin, 26, too, posts content on mental health on her Instagram account @awkwardgoat3 for close to 190,000 followers. She has also noticed a sudden proliferation of vlog-style
reels
on her timeline. Some feature people leaning on a car window as it rains, paired with a sad song to go. Then there are others where someone is turning around while walking, and a slowmotion effect to the pirouette along with a happy melody completes the package.
VIDEO GAMES
Every
TikTok
alternative — from Instagram Reels to YouTube Shorts — now equips its user base with tools and templates, features and filters, that uncomplicate the process of making and sharing short videos. YouTube has a
Remix
tool for users to clip and edit a 5-second-to-1-minute-long audio/visual content from an existing video to create their own Shorts, provided the original creator lets you sample their video.

In early 2022, Instagram launched Supersync, a feature that automatically syncs clips and pictures to the beat of a song for Reels. Shortly after, Garima Bhaskar, a photographer and content creator from Noida, published a tutorial blog on how to use the feature. It gained so much traction that it shows up among the top three results when you look up ‘Supersync + Instagram’ on Google. “Majority of the DMs I get on Instagram are from people asking me how to easily edit a video to the beats of music,” says Bhaskar, who has over 114,000 followers on the app. The feature doesn’t always detect the right beats “but is a good option for newbies”. “All these are attempts to reduce the anxiety around video-editing for regular folk, and make the creation process faster,” says Sanket Shah, CEO of InVideo, a homegrown videoediting app. Roughly 75% of InVideo’s users are “amateurs”, says Shah. “70% of the content uploaded to edit is in a video format and close to 85% of users edit the content down to 1-minute videos,” he adds. The app is active in multiple markets, including the US, UK, Canada and Australia.
International video-editing apps like InShot and VN (VlogNow) have gained prominence in India. VlogNow, with over 100 million installs, counts
India
among its top three markets, as per Sensor Tower. In June, the site Inshot.com got its highest traffic of 18% from India, as per analytics company Similarweb. InShot, the app, has over 500 million downloads on Android and about 18 million user reviews on Google Play Store. For perspective, Twitter, with over a billion Android installs, has about 21 million user reviews. These numbers indicate people are lapping up all the tech support they can get.
Last year, some of the top-trending, usergenerated augmented reality (AR) filters on Instagram in India — like ‘Enhance’ and ‘All Soften’ — were used in over 150 million reels, as per the data Instagram shared with ET. India is Instagram’s largest market by audience size with a userbase of 229 million, says a Statista report from January. Approximately 65% of Gen Z used a filter or a feature, or an effect, on a video app over the past 12 months, according to a Google/Ipsos Global YouTube Trends Survey from May.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
Vlogging is not a new content format but it seems to have caught the interest of more amateur creators in a post-pandemic world, says Gauri Bansal, a product manager at a consumer tech company. “In the early days of the pandemic, some took to glorifying mundane activities through their content as an escape from the reality of those times. Soon, everyone jumped on this trend to feel a sense of belonging,” she recalls. Multiple social media trends — like captioning videos with ‘POV’ (point of view) and stitching pictures to depict ‘Life as a Wes Anderson film’ — further encourage people to spin movie-like reels from ordinary moments of life.
This is the peak reels era when “people are making vlogs of ordinary moments even if they have a private account,” says Sheetal Nimbalkar, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai. It appeals to our innate desire to be socially rewarded even if it is within our small circle of people, she adds. “Otherwise, there’s little else in an ordinary person’s life, other than their birthday or wedding, that can evoke a similar reaction socially.”
Some believe there is no “access discrimination” on these platforms, unlike in the real world, says Nimbalkar. “In some sessions, clients have told me how happy they felt using the same filter as their favourite celebrity.” It has enabled a few to celebrate themselves. “I think I watch my own (vlog-style) reels more than anyone else’s content,” says Rayyan M (@rayyanmonkey on Instagram), a 32-year-old writer and diversity and inclusion specialist. “In these reels, I look beautiful and feel seen and appreciated, which doesn’t happen in my everyday life. As a trans person, I find this immensely powerful as it allows me to curate a narrative of my own in a cis-gendered, heteronormative, ableist and casteist world.”
Not everyone finds the process democratic or liberating. In Sahil Valmiki’s experience, most lifestyle vlogging trends tend to isolate people from marginalised communities. Take the ‘Can we skip to the good part’ trend where people stacked up clicks and clips of them living it up to an uplifting soundtrack of The Good Part by American indie pop band AJR. “People from marginalised communities barely had anything to contribute to this trend,” says Valmiki, editor of the online publication Dalit Desk.
“People from so-called upper castes use songs with words like ‘Banjara’ in their travel reels, romanticising the nomadic lifestyle, while lifestyle posts from the actual Banjara community (part of Denotified Tribes) on the app barely get any traction,” he adds, “even as their news-related reels often go viral”.
This exposes something primal in our behaviour as social media users, says Bansal: “We are subconsciously propagating that even the ‘mundane’ lifestyle has to have a certain type of aesthetic for it to be worthy of being celebrated.” Bansal also doesn’t like how this phenomenon is making her and many around her “collect information in the hope of creating a vibrant memory of a past moment in the future”. “We have lists carrying songs that can go well with a certain mood to be used for potential reels and stories. We post an old picture with a pre-selected song or caption when we are bored sitting at home. People are using AI to generate captions and reel ideas.”
This templatised depiction of daily life is making people less imaginative while giving them the illusion of being creative, says Anurag Minus Verma, a multimedia artist and podcast host. Not only does it omit the discomfort that goes into doing mundane tasks, but the act of utilising the mundane for content is also chipping away at “our ability to feel the boredom of mundanity”.
It’s as if “we are living in the moment ‘only’ to extract a potential snippet for a reel later,” says Niharika Gotety, 26, a program manager at a content-tech startup. She was in the ICU recently due to a health ailment and she caught herself thinking of a theme for a video she can make on her hospital experience.
On the one hand, Gotety feels it is healthier to romanticise mundane things like brushing your teeth or making your bed, as opposed to the previous social media era where only some people got to flaunt their exciting lives. On the other, she wonders if sometimes she intentionally “creates” some moments only to be able to make a video out of them later.
Given the scale at which people are recording themselves going about their lives, there may soon be many like Gotety who may find it increasingly hard to tell which part of life is real, and which part is (for) reel.

"Priyanka Chopra's Rs 2,000 crore 'Citadel' comes under scrutiny of Amazon CEO: Report",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/priyanka-chopras-rs-2000-crore-citadel-comes-under-scrutiny-of-amazon-ceo-report/articleshow/101569839.cms,07-07-2023,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is taking a hard look at some of its biggest TV shows amid company-wide cost-cutting drive, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Among the shows under scrutiny is
Priyanka Chopra
Jonas-Richard Madden starrer ""
Citadel
"", one of the most expensive series in TV history. Ever since ""
Citadel
"" debuted, it has failed to make into 10 most-watched streaming programs in the US in any week, the report said, citing Nielsen.
Amazon had launched its Hollywood studios division in 2010 and later added to the film and TV programming push by acquiring
MGM Studios
for $8.45 billion last year.
Recently, Amazon CEO asked executives for detailed budget analyses of some of their biggest shows to scrutinize the studio’s ballooning costs and mixed track record with audiences, Bloomberg reported. Last year, according to the report, Amazon spent $7 billion on original shows, licensed programs and sports, up from $5 billion the year before.
Many tech companies, including Amazon, have eliminated thousands of jobs this year. Amazon in March had announced plans to 9,000 more jobs, adding to the 18,000 employees the tech giant said it would lay off in January. Like other tech companies, including Facebook parent
Meta
and Google parent Alphabet, Amazon ramped up hiring during the pandemic to meet the demand from homebound Americans that were increasingly buying stuff online to keep themselves safe from the virus.
Apart from ""Citadel"", the other shows that are under scrutiny include Daisy Jones & the Six, The Power, Dead Ringers and The Peripheral, all of which cost more than $100 million each to produce but failed to crack Nielsen’s list of the 10 most-watched streaming programs in the US. Even The Rings of Power, which reportedly cost over $400 million plus, is part of that list.

Global spy thriller Citadel, starring Priyanka Chopra, reportedly cost more than $250 million or Rs 2,000 crore for one season.
In this thriller two top Citadel agents, Nadia Sinh (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) and Mason Kane (Richard Madden) are on a mission to save the world. But first, they must regain their memories—which were wiped clean—and find answers from their pasts that could obliterate the villains.
“The ambition of the show, which has never been attempted on film or television, was very exciting. I’m an actor who worked in Indian movies and then started working in American movies,” Priyanka Chopra Jonas said at a screening event for Citadel. “As someone who always wanted to see the globalization of international cinema, this is a joy. To see filmmakers from Italy, India, and America sit together, where entertainment doesn’t belong to a country anymore, where streaming is taking this to 290 territories, that’s like insane.”
For now, Amazon is keeping faith in ""Citadel"". Recently,
Prime Video
greenlit Season 2 of the spy thriller featuring Priyanka Chopra and Richard Madden in the lead roles. Joe Russo is set to direct every episode and executive producer David Weil will return as a showrunner.

OTT has gone on to become the most streamed entertainment property in India with over 400 Million (40 crore) Video Views on
JioCinema
, Viacom18 said in a statement.

Trai to start consultation on OTT communication apps' regulation,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/trai-to-start-consultation-on-ott-regulation/articleshow/101553037.cms,07-07-2023,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (
Trai
) will shortly start a much-anticipated consultation process on the question of regulating
over-the-top
(
OTT
) communications players, or apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, officials aware of the development said.
Among the questions that Trai plans to ask is, in case it is felt that some regulation is required, then which class of apps needs to be brought under the regulatory ambit, they said.
The consultation paper will also look into the definition of OTT, class of OTTs, demands of a level-playing field with telcos, and existing international practices, among others, they said.
“We will look at all the aspects,” one of the officials aware of the details told ET. “Not all OTT apps need regulation. Through the consultation process, we will seek comments from all stakeholders and also see what the international practices in this regard are.”
The telecom regulator had earlier recommended that OTT players shouldn’t be regulated. But it is revisiting the matter after the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) again asked it to propose a regulatory mechanism for apps.

ET had earlier reported that Trai was exploring different sets of regulatory mechanisms for communication apps and broadcasting apps.
DoT, on its part, wants to regulate only communication apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram – as proposed in the draft telecom bill - and not content or broadcasting ones such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.
Telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has made it clear that the basic purpose of regulating communication OTTs was to guard consumers against fraud, and not generate revenue.
Keeping this premise in mind, DoT has proposed the need for a mandatory know-your-customer (KYC) mechanism for all such apps in the draft telecom bill.
Through the upcoming consultation paper, Trai would try to address any ambiguity around different sets of OTT apps.
The draft telecom bill has not defined communication apps, but Trai wants to address the issue and clearly define/classify the OTTs and the set of apps that could be regulated by DoT.
The government believes that DoT should be the nodal ministry for communication apps, while the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) should continue to look after content, including apps such as Disney Hotstar and Sony Liv.
In its reference to Trai seeking to bring OTTs under regulation, DoT had said a mechanism should be evolved wherein it has powers to ban or curtail spread of misinformation.
“The need to regulate OTTs is urgent so as to ensure data security and protection of consumer privacy,” a DoT official had told ET.
DoT feels that there should be a mechanism through which it should be able to control and analyse OTT platforms real time, so that the spread of misinformation on such apps can be stopped.
The regulator will also deliberate on the demand of telecom operators regarding same-service-same-rules. The telecom operators have long been demanding that communication apps should be regulated as they offer the same set of services as the telcos. But while telcos are subjected to various licensing and regulatory provisions, including security requirements, apps don’t have any such obligations.
Internet activists and associations representing app providers such as IAMAI, Nasscom, and US-India Business Council have been opposing any kind of regulatory framework for OTT apps. The technology industry has continuously highlighted that the apps are already regulated by the IT Act and any further regulation will stifle innovation.

Media players continue to bet big on India cricketing rights,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media-players-continue-to-bet-big-on-india-cricketing-rights/articleshow/101512787.cms,05-07-2023,"Media companies continue to invest big on
cricketing rights
in
India
even as increasing live-streaming viewership and splitting of TV and digital rights between different entities make monetisation of cricket events a challenge.
Disney Star
, Sony-Zee,
Viacom
18, and smaller media players are expected to invest more than $11 billion on marquee cricket properties during the 2023–2027 cycle, officials and analysts said.
“Cricket continues to attract huge investments since it guarantees eyeballs,” said Rajesh Kaul, head of sports business at
Sony
Pictures Networks India (SPNI). “It also holds strategic value for rights holders since it drives the growth of both OTT and TV businesses,” he said.
The Indian
Premier
League (IPL) and the International Cricket Council (ICC) have recently sold five-year and four-year media rights for the Indian market at $6.2 billion and $3 billion, respectively.
Industry experts are optimistic that the media rights of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (
BCCI
), which are soon to be put up for bidding, could generate more than Rs 10,000 crore, or $1.2 billion at the current exchange rate.

The media rights of Asian Cricket Council (
ACC
), which conducts Asia Cup and some other tournaments for Asian teams, are also up for renewal this year.
Furthermore, prominent cricket rights outside of India, such as those for Cricket Australia, Cricket South Africa, and the England Cricket Board, have been acquired by Disney Star, Viacom 18 and Sony for about $500–600 million.
Bhairav Shanth, cofounder of leading sports, entrainment and media consulting firm ITW Consulting, said live sports will continue to see big investments in sponsorship as well as media rights. “Globally, sports assets are only growing in value, and not just for a direct return on investment reasons,” he said.
High upfront investments in sports are likely to pay off in the long run, Shanth said. “The reason we are seeing much higher values for cricket rights is due to the growth in popularity of the sport, rise in digital consumption, and competitive intensity,” he added.
Three major players – Disney Star, Sony and Viacom 18 – are actively vying for key sports properties in India.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd
(ZEEL), which is currently in the process of merging with Sony, has also re-entered the sports business by securing the rights for ICC TV and Indian T20 League media.
People aware of the development said BCCI is considering a four-year cycle for media rights to bilateral matches involving the Indian cricket team to be played in India. It is also contemplating splitting the TV and digital rights to maximise the value of the property, they said.
“The valuation of BCCI media rights will depend on multiple factors, including the format of the matches (tests, ODIs, and T20s), the demand and supply situation, and the outcome of the Zee-Sony merger,” said a media analyst who requested anonymity.
The analyst said the combined value of media rights for the IPL, ICC, BCCI, and ACC could reach about $11 billion.
The person, though, anticipates a cautious approach when it comes to the bidding for BCCI media rights, considering that the companies have already committed $9 billion towards IPL and ICC rights.
Disney Star, having committed $6 billion for IPL TV and ICC media rights, has sub-licenced the ICC TV rights to ZEEL for an estimated $1.5 billion. Viacom 18 has obtained the IPL digital rights for $3 billion.
In April 2018, Disney Star had acquired BCCI media rights for five years for Rs 6,138 crore, which amounted to about $944 million at the then exchange rate of Rs 65 to the dollar.
Monetisation becoming tougher
The value of cricket rights continues to soar in India in spite of monetisation challenges amid macroeconomic and regulatory changes.
Overall ad spending on the recently concluded IPL had dropped by almost 20% to Rs 4,000 crore. Disney Star, the broadcast rights holder, saw a significant drop in its ad earnings while digital rights holder Viacom18 fell short of its lofty targets.
“It will be very difficult for media companies to recover their investments in cricket rights,” media veteran Kunal Dasgupta said. “There could be a price correction once these properties come up for renewal.”
According to him, financial commitments made by media companies for cricket rights over the next four years are estimated to range between $10 billion and $12 billion.
Dasgupta said Viacom 18 is investing heavily in sports since it wants to build JioCinema. Disney wants to remain in cricket to protect its revenues. Sony, he said, is focused on profitability and will stay away from loss-making properties.
Unbundling IPL's TV and digital rights, meanwhile, paid rich dividends for the Indian cricket board last year. In rupee terms, the value of IPL media rights has trebled from Rs 16,000 crore in the 2018–22 cycle to Rs 48,000 crore in the current cycle.
ICC, too, had sold the global media rights to Disney for $2 billion for 2015–23. For the upcoming cycle, it has sold the media rights for just the Indian territory for $3 billion.
“The value of the cricket rights is on the rise due to an increase in the number of matches and the entry of a new player like Viacom 18,” a high-ranking media executive said on condition of anonymity. “Compared to TV, the value of digital rights will continue to grow.”
The executive believes inflation in cricket rights fees would take a toll on the value of non-cricket sports.

We've become language agnostic: PVR's Sanjeev Bijli on growing market of non-English films in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/weve-become-language-agnostic-pvrs-sanjeev-bijli-on-growing-market-of-non-english-films-in-india/articleshow/101416394.cms,01-07-2023,"Language is no longer a barrier when it comes to good content, says
Sanjeev Kumar Bijli
, Executive Director,
PVR INOX Ltd
, who has acquired Sundance Film Festival breakout ""Past Lives"" for
India
release. ""Past Lives"", by first time director Celine Song, is an English-Korean relationship drama that has earned rave reviews with critics hailing it as one of best movies of the year. It has already been released in the US and hits Indian theatres on July 7.
Bijli said the commercial success of Japanese anime film ""Suzume"" inspired them to look beyond English titles and experiment with the kind of movies they want to distribute in India through
PVR INOX Pictures
, the motion picture arm of
PVR INOX Limited
.
""In the last few years, we have become very language agnostic. We now watch Tamil films in Tamil with subtitles, Malayalam films in Malayalam, which is why Hindi remakes don't do so well. We just need good content now and that made us realise that we need to go beyond only English movies and Japanese anime which gave us the confidence to look at other languages,"" Bijli told PTI in an interview.
""It's hard to ignore a good film when you have seen it... We saw ""Past Lives"" at the Berlin Film Festival in February and fell in love with the film. It comes from a studio called A24 who we bought and distributed films for in the past as well,"" he said.
Movies are a risky
business
, but Bijli is happy that ""Past Lives"" has garnered so much love, attention and positive reviews, since they acquired it for Indian markets.
Live Events
""We have been buying and distributing 30-35 films a year. We have been in the business for 20 years. Most of them have been in the English language but we have been very keen to introduce foreign language films because we think there is a market for it,"" he added.
According to him, ""Suzume"" by Japanese director Makoto Shinkai made about Rs 10 crore, which was previously rare for an anime movie in India.
""In the past, we have experimented with French films. We did 'Notre-Dame on Fire ' last year. One of them that became a significant
revenue
segment for us was Japanese Anime. We experimented... The whole DNA of the company is that we must experiment because Indian audiences have become mature now. They now have access to all kind of content on OTT platforms,"" Bijli said.
""Past Lives"" takes viewers on a journey of time and fate through two young souls in South Korea, who, torn apart by destiny, reunite decades later in New York. The movie features Greta Lee as Nora, South Korean star Teo Yoo as
Nora
's childhood sweetheart Hae-Sung and American actor John Magaro as her husband Arthur.
Bijli said they are planning to release the film in about 75 to 100 cinemas in metro cities, a release strategy that worked well for ""Suzume"" where they started small but increased the screen numbers as the demand grew.
""Normally, we buy films in different stages but this time around, we could see the finished product and it just resonated with all of us. It will resonate across cultures. It is half Korean, half English but so well made. We are very happy to bring the film to India on July 7.""
PVR
also distributed 2020 Oscar-winner ""Parasite"" in India and the film made over Rs five crore at the box office, he said.
The popularity of Korean content has continued to grow ever since with viewers in India also embracing K-dramas and K-pop in a big way in recent years and Bijli said the company is ""keen to get more and more Korean films"" for distribution.
Next on the slate for
PVR INOX
Pictures is another anime film called ""First Slam Dunk"", horror movie ""Talk to Me"" and ""White Bird"", starring Helen Mirren.

"ZEE-Sony merger will go through, whether I'm CEO or not, says Punit Goenka",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-sony-merger-will-go-through-whether-im-ceo-or-not-says-punit-goenka/articleshow/101175030.cms,22-06-2023,"What is your strategy to grow market shares in the TV, digital, film, and music businesses?
In the last few quarters, we have gained share across markets South India and Punjab ahead of our competition. The only places where we still need to do a lot more work are the Hindi and Marathi markets. We are working very aggressively on those markets and I am pretty confident that those will also start to bounce back. Linear television will remain a key focus and a cash cow for the
business
. I expect the growth to come from the
advertising
and subscription markets. ZEE5 is going to be a critical investment phase for the company. These two (TV and digital) are the key pillars under which we are working. We also have music and movie businesses which are more like feeder businesses and strategic alliances businesses which feed into the linear and digital businesses.
Will ZEEL continue to keep its Hindi entertainment channel off DD Free Dish despite losing ad
revenue
?
As one of the proponents of getting off DD Free Dish and I was one of the advocates for that. The erosion in subscription revenue that I was seeing would have hurt the business in the medium to long term. The most stable revenue stream in our business is subscription revenue. Advertising will always be volatile based on viewership and macroeconomic situation. To safeguard that stable revenue stream of the company, it was very very critical that we execute the DD Free Dish part. There is a short-term loss of hundreds of crores for the industry, but the longer-term loss on the subscription revenue would have been far greater. If you look at the subscription revenue for the industry, it would be in the ballpark of Rs 12,000 crore. The total advertising revenue coming through free days for the industry was Rs 1800 crore. So it's a question of Rs 12,000 crore versus Rs 1800 crore. So it looks like a very short-term loss that we are incurring, but to protect the long-term revenue stream of the subscription side.
The government is planning to open up the C-band spectrum to the telecom sector. Will this move hurt the TV broadcasters?
I think the cost of the upgrades of the cable networks is minuscule. It's less than Rs 50,000 per headend. So I don't see that being a very big issue from that perspective. And we are all geared to make sure that there is no disruption caused by the C-band spectrum. I don't expect any disruption.
Is it true that big advertisers are doing short-term deals with broadcasters?
No, it's not correct at all. All our FMCG customers are still doing annual deals and the campaign clients always come on the campaign so that's a different matter. But the FMCG and auto clients are all doing annual deals with us. There's no disruption. We are the number two network in this country and it's difficult for advertisers to just ignore us. There may be some short-term hiccups that one faces with a few advertisers as the negotiations are really tough. At the end of the day, we are also in this business for the long term.

Taking Sebi order in ZEE case seriously: Sony,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/taking-sebi-order-in-zee-case-seriously-sony/articleshow/101172163.cms,22-06-2023,"Sony Pictures Entertainment
(SPE) has said that it takes the Securities and Exchange Board of India''s (Sebi) interim order against
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEE) promoters very seriously and will continue to monitor developments that may affect the deal.
""There have been several erroneous press reports recently speculating about the future of ZEE's planned merger with
Sony Pictures Networks
India following Sebi's interim order against Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka. We take very seriously the SEBI interim order and will continue to monitor developments that may affect the deal,"" SPE said in a statement.
On June 12, Sebi passed an interim order against
ZEE
promoters following an investigation that found the two had reportedly abused their board positions in ZEE by ""siphoning off funds for their own benefit,"" the regulator said. The regulator has directed ZEE to place the order before its board within seven days.
The Goenkas were given 21 days to respond to the regulator's order. Meanwhile, the Goenkas moved the securities appellate tribunal against the Sebi order on June 13.
SAT
admitted Chandra and Goenka's appeal on June 15 and gave Sebi 48 hours to file its reply.

In its reply to SAT, Sebi reiterated that the Goenkas had diverted public funds to private entities. It added that the two are involved in a myriad of different schemes and transactions through which vast amounts of public money belonging to listed companies were diverted to private entities owned and controlled by these individuals. ZEE had also written a letter to Sebi stating that ""continuous and repetitive"" inquiries into the same cause of action damage the company and shareholders. It had also stated that the transaction flagged by Sebi pertains to 2019, and that a detailed explanation has already been provided to stock exchanges and Sebi.
It added that the inquiries might also have an effect on the company's merger process with Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI).
The two companies had decided to merge operations in December 2021, with Sony owning 50.86% of the combined company and ZEE shareholders, including the promoters, holding the remaining 49.14%. ZEE's founder would own a 3.99% stake in the merged entity.

gaming companies
that are still in the process of building IP and technology can be a call of doom for these companies, said
Saumya Singh Rathore, a co-founder of gaming platform
WinZO Games
. In an exclusive interview with
ET Online’s Gourab Das
, Rathore said the possibility of imposing higher taxes poses challenges, not only impacting the runway of early-stage innovation-driven startups but also potentially shrinking access to FDIs and capital for even larger, more mature companies.
What is your take on the proposed 28% tax on online games?
Saumya Singh Rathore:
Gaming is a fast-evolving sector with a very diverse composition. There are 15-20-year-old large companies in Fantasy and Rummy, while at the same time, the sector also has more than 900 startups that are less than 5 years old and are focusing on newer models and creating products that currently address the needs of Indian consumers exclusively. Companies that have achieved stability might be able to handle any additional tax burden, as they have a stable revenue model at scale and matured margins. However, newer ventures would need to direct the resources available to them towards the creation of intellectual property (IP) and technology, especially given that the capital pool has dried up due to macro conditions.
Proposing a 28% tax for gaming companies that are still focusing on building IP and technology would kill the companies in the sector that are building for tomorrow. It will lead to the demise of many smaller players and deter any new entrants with alternatives to foreign products and technology. The burden of higher taxes will stifle innovation and prevent companies from scaling up, ultimately harming the larger technology industry as a whole.
Given the increasing industry size of online games, will this tax be detrimental to the country’s business scenario?

Saumya Singh Rathore:
Entrepreneurs who are currently in the ecosystem are the ones building a potential sector that can create the world's gaming epicenter out of India, employing millions in technology and product creation. The sector has the potential to create at least 5 decacorns and 10 unicorns in the near term, contributing meaningfully to the country's GDP and becoming the next line of export. The gaming industry exemplifies the importance of attracting top talent to the sector. China witnessed a surge in talent from various fields, including technology, business, and fine arts, moving into the gaming sector. Gaming even surpassed banking in terms of prestige, leading to the rise of companies such as Tencent and Garena.
Such success stories necessitate the development of an entire ecosystem, including supportive policies and favorable taxation. The industry has seen significant investment from both domestic and international investors. However, the possibility of imposing higher taxes poses challenges, not only impacting the runway of early-stage innovation-driven startups but also potentially shrinking access to FDIs and capital for even larger, more mature companies. India has the opportunity to become a leader in the global gaming industry, but even discussions of imposing a 28% tax send a negative message to global investors, who may perceive it as a lack of government encouragement for the sector.
The 28% GST is typically imposed on either luxury or the so-called sin items. Will that tag also hurt?
Saumya Singh Rathore:
Taxation plays a significant role in shaping investment decisions as it is a direct reflection of policymakers' sentiments on the sector. Over the past 18 months, the gaming sector, despite being the fastest-growing sector, has experienced a complete halt to funds flowing into it. Even discussions of categorizing gaming as a sin tax create uncertainty and discourage both foreign and domestic investments. Any perceived lack of encouragement from policymakers further amplifies the perception of risk, causing potential investors to withdraw and impeding the flow of foreign direct investments (FDIs).
Categorising gaming as a sin tax not only impacts the industry economically but also culturally. It may deter some of the best talent from engaging in the sector to build technology and IP for export from the country, thus obstructing the growth and potential success of the industry.
It is also pertinent to note that a higher tax bracket of sin tax is consciously made applicable to products that are considered ""avoidable"" (such as cigarettes, liquor, gambling, etc.) or services that are considered luxury (luxury hotels, luxury cars, expensive movie tickets, etc.). However, services that are commonplace and used regularly by a large proportion of the populace, even lower than 18% GST rates. It will be hurtful when online gaming for the masses is taxed at par with high-end luxury goods and services. As a platform, we have observed that 90% of our consumers are from the middle and lower-income segments and reside in non-urban India (Bharat). For example,
WinZO
is the cheapest alternative for our audience, who on average spend Rs. 200- Rs. 300 as an alternative to monthly subscriptions of platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.
Are there risks to the industry with the government's categorization of games and determining what is permissible or non-permissible?
Saumya Singh Rathore:
The categorisation allows the government to differentiate between legitimate players and illegal entities, treating them differently and avoiding knee-jerk reactions from the states. It allows the government to protect Indian consumers from illegal products.
The central government's inclusion of online gaming in IT rules is a net positive. It further legitimises the category and resolves conflicts between companies and states regarding game classification. The certification process through the SRO is a critical process. If not well implemented, it may hinder fair market access for otherwise legitimate businesses.
Over the past 18-24 months, India has witnessed an influx of offshore betting and gambling companies, putting vulnerable mobile-first users at risk. The illegal offshore betting and gambling category in India is estimated to be much larger than the legalized gaming category, exposing consumers and their money to significant risk. The Central Government’s involvement was much needed and came at just the right time to take holistic steps to protect consumers. The past 18 months have also seen aggressive and progressive initiatives by Consumer Affairs and Information and Broadcasting to restrict access of illegal businesses, imposing clearer guidelines for businesses reaching consumers through mass-media or the internet.
However, isn’t there a fine line between
fantasy sports
being a game of skill or chance?
Saumya Singh Rathore:
Fantasy has been declared a game of skill by the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court's verdict provides clarity, reducing the grey area after much examination of the model. At WinZO, we create games that prioritize the preponderance of skill to provide an engaging experience for users.

Anurag Thakur
said
OTT
, which emerged as one of the biggest mediums during the
COVID-19
time, has bridged the geographical barriers. He said with the vanishing of boundary in OTT, the possibility of content from across the world being accepted by the pan-world audience has increased and cited the example of Korean content.
""Soft power doesn't have any boundary. The
Covid-triggered lockdown
had spurted the emergence of the OTT platform in a big way,"" he said at an awards programme here on Saturday night.
He said Bengal, the land of a visionary and poet like Rabindranath Tagore, a film icon like
Satyajit Ray
, a new direction giver filmmaker like
Ritwik Ghatak
, a new age singing sensation like Arijit Singh can win the hearts of OTT audiences in the world with new content in near future.
Thakur in this context harped on the issue of the need for any regulation on OTT content or not by the stakeholders.
""The content will be seen by family. On the issue of regulation I am keeping the query before you,"" he said.

""While the Telugu version is naturally leading the charts on the platform in terms of ticket sales, Hindi is a close second. The 3D format is the most preferred format of watching the film on the big screen with over 72% of movie-goers opting for the immersive movie-watching experience,"" he stated.

SVP Karan Taurani said Adipurush will come as a respite for cinema exhibitors who have been facing dwindling occupancy levels, which are still below pre-pandemic levels. He noted that The
Kerala Story
has been the only silver lining for the industry.
""We expect a strong opening day in South India, as net box office opening there could be in the range of Rs 50–60 crore for dubbed languages, whereas Hindi too would be healthy at Rs 20 crore. In terms of lifetime domestic box office, we expect a net box office collection of Rs 350 crore to Rs 400 crore,"" he added.

CEO Amrita Pandey said June has always been a phenomenal release period over the years for youth and family movies. ""We are now looking forward to the June and July theatrical releases performing well at the box office. The theatrical admissions for Zara Hatke and Zara Bachke have been extremely encouraging for the industry.""
Film business expert Girish Johar expects Adipurush to generate high footfalls across languages since this is the first major tentpole film that will be released after Pathaan.
""Another factor going in the film's favour is the fact that this is the holiday season for school kids. The story is deeply rooted in Indian culture, so it will attract family audiences,"" he said.
Johar also stated that the audience's preference for watching the kind of movies in theatres has totally changed. ""Audiences are willing to watch content-driven films in theatres."" They are not bothered about the genre or the cast of the film.""
Dutta said that the recent trend of multilingual content being popular among pan-India audiences is holding true. ""We would continue to see more of such movies doing well on the national scene,"" he noted.
According to a GroupM-Ormax Media report, the gross box-office collection stood at Rs 10,637 crore in 2022.

Ultra Media & Entertainment to invest Rs 250 crore in next five years in its Marathi OTT platform ‘Ultra Jhakaas’,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ultra-media-entertainment-to-invest-rs-250-crore-in-next-five-years-in-its-marathi-ott-platform-ultra-jhakaas/articleshow/101011107.cms,15-06-2023,"Ultra Media and Entertainment Group
plans to invest Rs 250 crore in the next five years in its recently launched Over The Top (OTT) platform Ultra Jhakaas.
Ultra Jhakaas
is focused chiefly on content made in the Marathi language. At present, the platform offers more than 2000 hours of content covering over 1000 titles in its library.
‘We plan to expand the content catalogue of our new OTT platform, Ultra Jhakaas. We will invest Rs250 crore in the next five years in the platform,"" said
Sushilkumar Agrawal
, CEO of Ultra Media and Entertainment
.
The company plans to exclusively release Marathi films on its platform at regular intervals. Agrawal, CEO of Ultra Media and Entertainment said, “To reach out to a wider audience, the platform is also exclusively streaming
Hollywood
and South-Indian films across all languages dubbed in Marathi. Ultra will also be producing and streaming original content such as web series and films made by prominent directors on the platform.” The company is in discussion with production houses for co-production of fresh content. In the near future, the platform will also stream live events across various genres. These include Marathi theatre plays both in the live and recorded formats.
At present, there are seventeen OTT platforms which provide content in regional languages. Some of the prominent ones are
Hoichoi
(Bengali), Aha (Telugu), Sun NXT (Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam,
Kannada
, Bengali), Koode (Malayalam), Regal Talkies (Tamil) and Ultra Jhakaas (Marathi). According to a recent industry report by media and entertainment research firm Ormax, close to 30% of
India
has access to OTT platforms. The subscribers’ base of India’s OTT industry is pegged at 42.38 crore.
It must be noted that only 10% of the total audience of OTT is in the top six metros. This shows the potential for OTT platforms to capture regional language audiences beyond metros. Even OTT platforms are increasing their content in regional languages. According to the
FICCI-EY
report of 2022, the share of regional languages in overall OTT Video Content in India will grow by two times to 54% in 2024 from 27% in 2020.

ZEE-Sony deal: I-T dept plans to challenge ITAT ruling,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-sony-deal-i-t-dept-plans-to-challenge-itat-ruling/articleshow/100974446.cms,13-06-2023,"The income tax (I-T) department will likely move the
Bombay High Court
against a tribunal order disallowing capital gains tax in India on the sale of Ten Sports to
SonyPictures Network
India by a Mauritius-based entity linked to
Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEE), sources aware of the move told ET.
The capital gains, on the sale dating back seven years, amount to about Rs 1,800 crore.
In March, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), while allowing a plea filed by ZEE’s step-down subsidiary, observed it has no permanent establishment, thus entitling it to avail the treaty benefit applicable under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). It further said that gains arising on alienation of property would be chargeable to tax only in the state of residence of the alienator - in this case in Mauritius.
Gains of about Rs 1,790 crore “on the sale of the sports broadcasting undertaking by the assessee is not chargeable to tax in India,” the ITAT had held.
A permanent establishment under I-T parlance means having a presence in the form of a fixed place or service based outside the company's state of residence.

Section 260 A of the income tax act allows the department to file an appeal before a high court within whose territorial jurisdiction the assessing officer is located.
In October 2016, the deputy commissioner of income tax, international tax circle, Mumbai had issued a certificate authorising the step-down subsidiary, Taj TV to pay Rs 2,267 crores to
Aqua Holding
Investment, a Mauritius company linked to Sony. This was after the company disclosed that during FY17, it had disposed of its global sports broadcasting business to Aqua Holding by way of a slump sale.
On August 31, 2016, an agreement was entered into by ZEE as the seller and Sony Pictures Network India as the purchaser.
The IT department has argued that ZEE is not a service provider to Taj TV as the play-out agreement of 2017 is entered more than eight months after the acquisition of the sports broadcasting business by Sony.

Taj TV had contended that it had only received certain services from Taj TV India in respect of advertisement and distribution and from ZEE for play-out services. All these entities are mere service providers and paid according to the contracts.
The ITAT had held that the IT’s addition toward play-out facilities was an afterthought. “It is to be noted that ZEE is carrying out play-out facilities …for many other broadcasters. It is not for this year but for the past several years, ZEE is providing the service of play-out stations,” the tribunal bench had ruled.
The tribunal also held the tax department failed to prove the twin test of determining a permanent establishment, as it couldn’t provide evidence that the Indian entity had habitually exercised the authority to conclude contracts.

"Ad spends on IPL have fallen by over a fifth, says Viacom18 Sports' CEO",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ad-spends-on-ipl-have-fallen-by-over-a-fifth-says-viacom18-sports-ceo/articleshow/100749659.cms,05-06-2023,"Advertising
spending on the Indian Premier League (
IPL
) across TV and
digital
has dropped by a fifth from last year, Viacom18 Sports' chief executive
Anil Jayaraj
told ET.
""Overall, the
IPL ad spends
have dropped 20% over last year because some of the categories, like betting, cryptocurrency, edtech, etc., were completely missing, and the IPL TV viewership had fallen quite dramatically last year,""
Jayaraj
said, adding that the viewership drop has a lag effect on advertisement
revenue
. He said the absence of new-age advertisers has hurt linear TV a lot more than digital. ""Digital revenues are not dependent on certain categories as ticket sizes are affordable and people can choose the audiences that they want to target,"" Jayaraj said.
According to industry estimates, IPL's ad revenue this year has dropped to ₹4,000 crore from between ₹4,000 crore and ₹5,000 crore in 2022.
Disney Star
held both the TV and digital
rights
last year. Without getting into the specifics, Jayaraj said Viacom18 has met its revenue and viewership targets. The company has paid ₹23,758 crore to acquire the IPL digital rights for five years till 2027.
""We had set targets on revenue and viewership. On both, it certainly looks like we should have done that (achieve our targets),"" he said. Viacom18 had set a target of attracting ₹3,700 crore in ad revenue and reaching 550 million viewers. ""We are still collating the viewership numbers,"" he said.
According to Jayaraj, the overall revenue mix for the Indian Premier League has changed this year. Till last year, TV used to account for the lion's share.
Live Events
""Our viewership was dramatically high on digital this year, purely because we were accessible to all consumers,"" he said. ""Connected TV's growth was phenomenal. Because of that, digital had a manifold jump over last year's revenue. We have managed to deliver good revenue, and therefore, the ratio of TV to digital has changed.""
Jayaraj believes that the IPL will come out very strong due to viewership growth this year. He expects missing advertising categories like new-age companies to come back strongly next year.
The Viacom18 Sports CEO said IPL will continue to remain free because of the success the company has achieved this year. ""We have had huge success this year, so there is no real reason for us to change our strategy,"" he said.
According to Jayaraj, the ad-led model is the best monetisation route in the country due to the growth seen in the digital viewer base.

"Buoyed by record viewership in IPL, Disney Star eyes another leap during upcoming sporting events",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/buoyed-by-record-viewership-in-ipl-disney-star-eyes-another-leap-during-upcoming-sporting-events/articleshow/100742583.cms,04-06-2023,"With
Tata IPL 2023
surpassing expectations in terms of viewership and fan engagements, broadcaster
Disney Star
is now gearing up for another leap in the coming sporting events, including
ICC
tournaments and
pro-Kabaddi league
, the company's head for sports Sanjog Gupta said.
During the latest
IPL
season concluded last week, Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) data suggested play-offs delivered a 44 per cent higher rating than last year and surpassed the previous peak recorded during 2020.
The surge in viewership extended to the Hindi-speaking markets, where Disney Star grabbed the highest viewership ever with 32.9 crore.
""It has surpassed our expectations,"" Gupta told PTI, adding, ""most of the records have been broken"" this season in terms of viewership.
Now Disney Star would focus on the coming ICC events such as Asia Cup and India's tour to South Africa besides pro-kabaddi league, in which it has invested substantially.
Live Events
""We are currently very much focused on the pro-kabaddi league... We have managed to build a foundation for pro-kabaddi, which it can leap from. The second leap of kabaddi is due. It is going to be the 10th season of kabaddi, which is coming up. It's time to take the next leap in its journey,"" he said.
When asked about Disney Star's expansion by adding new tournaments/ league titles beyond cricket, Gupta said the group is always interested to experiment in other sports as well.
""We are always open to the idea of experimenting with a new sport and will continue to position ourselves and build a portfolio which is genuinely multi-sport than a single sports portfolio,"" Gupta said.
He further added: ""We have been partners with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports over the last five years for 'Khelo India' initiatives. The whole purpose of being involved in the multi-sport like that we use to be able to showcase all sports which are popular and have a high degree of participation in India on Star Sports and Disney Hotstar.""
Now Disney Star is gearing up for the WTC (World Test Championship) Final tournament, which is going to be a big cricketing event for the fans.
""Obviously India has not won any ICC event since 2013. So the stakes are high for this one to actually win an ICC event after 10 years. We are obviously building this as the ultimate test for the Indian team,"" he said, adding, ""After this, we have Asia Cup which is likely to happen later this year and then the big one, the World Cup, which is coming back to India after 12 years, in October, November.""
This will be followed up by an India tour of South Africa.
""In terms of what's next, I think there is a lot that is lined up on Star Sports over the next six months itself,"" Gupta added.
Terming this IPL season overall as ""fantastic"", Gupta said Disney Star said the viewing figures which have emerged have broken most of the previous records.
""We have also seen 46 matches crossed the peak concurrency of three crore viewers per match which has been phenomenal,"" he said.
The overall consumption which is in terms of minutes watched is also the second highest after Covid, which shows the ""intensity and frequency"" of consumption of overall engagement.
""Across all metrics, it is an unprecedented IPL in terms of the response that we have got from fans and the viewing figures on the Disney Star suggest that it is obviously the biggest IPL ever,"" he said.
This time IPL has delivered on multiple strategic priorities that the organisation had. Compared to last season, there is a growth in the premium demographic, which is the higher socioeconomic classes, and growth among the youngest demographic of viewers which is kids below the age of 14.
The 2023 season of IPL viewership had a competition between TV and digital. Disney Star had television rights, while Reliance-backed Viacom18 had digital rights had done live streaming with its OTT platform JioCinema.
JioCinema has also created several records in terms of 12 crore unique viewers and 3.2 crore of peak concurrency in Tata IPL 2023.
Over this, Gupta said: ""We do not see it as a competition. The two platforms are different. Our focus is on serving fans. We believe that we are putting out an ideal viewing experience for the fan who wants to watch IPL and have an experience which is synonymous with Star Sports and with the big screen.""
The same fan may choose to follow the IPL on handheld devices when he or she doesn't have access to the big screen or TV.
""That is addictive. If that helps develop or grow the engagement of the fan with IPL and deepen the affinity for IPL then it is only adding to the overall price,"" he said.
He further added Disney Star was ""agnostic of screens"" as it had live coverage of the IPL matches available on TV and other associated content available on its digital platforms.
Besides, Disney Star is also looking to add more languages for commentary for the next season of IPL. It started the journey of localising cricket and customising cricket for specific regions in 2012 in regional languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Marathi.
""We are constantly looking for new spaces or the new regions we have the potential for growth that we can go into by adding not just a language but also a localised way of covering or a localised take on the cricket coverage,"" said Gupta,
Disney Star will continue to experiment and look at newer opportunities for growth not just on the language vector, but also on other vectors such as programming etc.
Besides, in this season of IPL, several new heroes have emerged such as Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh and Ruturaj Gaikwad, and they have become household names now.
""It is a great sign that on one side new heroes are coming and becoming popular and on the other side viewers below the age of 14 are watching in larger numbers than ever before on TV,"" Gupta added.

Netflix shareholders reject pay packages for top executives,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/netflix-shareholders-reject-pay-packages-for-top-executives/articleshow/100713033.cms,03-06-2023,"Netflix Inc. shareholders voted to reject pay packages for the company's leadership, including Co-Chief Executive Officers
Ted Sarandos
and
Greg Peters
, a non-binding protest against lavish pay for top media executives.
Sarandos is supposed to make as much as $40 million between his salary, bonus and stock options while
Peters
, who was named co-CEO in Janauary, is supposed to make $34.6 million. Reed Hastings, the company's co-founder and executive chairman, will earn $3 million.
The shareholders voted against the proposed compensation during an annual meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter. Netflix's board can disregard the results, as they have in the past, though the vote is significant given the current strife between major Hollywood studios and screenwriters.
Striking Hollywood writers have lambasted media companies for paying their executives too much money, pointing to the salaries of Walt Disney Co. chief Bob Iger and
Warner
Bros. Discovery Inc. boss David Zaslav, among others. The writers say they are asking for an increase in salary that is less than a handful of moguls make per year. The
Guild
began a strike in early May with its members demanding higher pay amid rapid changes in the way people watch their programs and films.
Most of the votes were in before the
Writers Guild of America
, which represents more than 11,500 screenwriters, recommended the shareholders to vote against the packages in a public letter last week, said the person, who declined to be identified.

And Bodhi Tree Systems – the jostling had begun even before the first match was bowled in the tournament.

Disney claims highest-rated playoffs match ever with over 6 crore, while

Listen Morning Brief Podcast
In a wide ranging and candid exclusive interview with
Sanjog Gupta
, Head of Sports Disney STAR Network we discuss viewership growth to revenue targets and life beyond T20 and if sports on linear TV is still going strong, how long will it remain an outlier? Edited excerpts:

'Nearly 500 million TV viewers tuned in to watch IPL till play-off stage'
ARIJIT: So straight off, This season of IPL was a first on many counts. It was probably the first time in a long time the TV and digital rights were split. It was also the first time that the split was happening at a time when, thanks to cheap data, we had seen exponential growth of the digital universe in India. So how was it like to compete?
SANJOG: Would it be anti-climactic if I said we didn't want to compete? Look, in the truest sense, our purpose with IPL 2023, much like our purpose with any property on star sports, is to grow it for fans. And the way that we broke it down was. In three parts, we said we have to drive the consideration for IPL at scales never seen before. We have to drive the consideration for IPL on TV at scales never seen before. And we have to drive consideration for IPL on tv on Star Sports at scales never seen before. True. So it was in three layers that we were really challenging ourselves to better what we have delivered over the last five years.
ARIJIT: I said the word compete because there was a personal angle to it. There were a lot of your ex-colleagues now on the other side, some might even go to the extent to say you were up against your own mentor Uday Shankar?
SANJOG: That's a really interesting question as with cricket, there’s an emotional side to the game, and there is the process slash business side to the game. We had to make sure that we stay focused on what we are looking to deliver. So yes, there are personal angles and there are relationships and relationships which continue to remain strong. The very purpose, mission, and drive around IPL came from an internal challenge that the team posed to itself, that we have built IPL to be the biggest property and have grown it over the last five years and is there scope for us to take it to the next level? Correct. And that is genuinely the only sense of competition that every member of the team had, and which is something I feel deeply overwhelmed by.

ARIJIT: Correct. But the journey began, if I may say, with on a very aggressive pitch, the Jio Cinema or Reliance’s positioning from the first week itself was very clear -- Linear TV is dead, and they were really aggressive about it. Were you initially taken back? And would you say, looking back, you were defensive in the beginning first?
SANJOG: Were we taken aback? Perhaps not so much taken aback, but yes, it played a certain role in actually driving us to commit to that belief. We had from the start a lot more because we had chosen to play the game a certain way and, and to use a cricket analogy, you play to your strengths and we believed the brand of Star Sports, the availability and accessibility of TV around the country and the width of the Star network gave us a foundation which we believed could help us deliver an IPL at a scale never seen before.
ARIJIT: But let me ask you the nub of the issue Is linear TV dead when it comes to live sports in India?
SANJOG: If there was a myth that linear TV was even dying, when it comes to live sport, then that myth has been busted wide open. I will cite a few numbers at last count. The ratings of the finals still to come. we are now at 49.6 core, or 496 million viewers of the live broadcast of IPL. We have crossed 400 billion minutes of consumption which is 40,000 core minutes of consumption. The first number that that I mentioned is the highest viewership that IPL has ever had, which shows the scale of reach for IPL, just in terms of the sheer number of viewers who have logged in.

Jio Cinema's penetration jumped 4X on the back of free IPL streaming
The second number that I just cited shows the extent of engagement. It is the second highest with the highest being the Covid year when everyone was home and IPL was the only game in town and thus was deeply engaging. So both in terms of reach and access, in terms of how many viewers actually logged into watch and in terms of the depth of their engagement.
We have broken records and set new benchmarks that can't be on a platform that is dying. If anything, we have grown significantly on the back of IPL. Another number, which will surprise many : the growth in viewership for kids below the age of 14 has been 63% compared to last season, which goes to show that not only is I
PL on TV growing and breaking records, but its future is also secure to a large extent.
ARIJIT: You know what intrigues me globally Disney is going underweight on TV and bulking up digital. The Indian strategy therefore looks like an outlier, but for how long can India remain
SANJOG: I think the question around Disney's strategy globally is best answered in the context of different regions that Disney operates in. There are regions where Disney continues to have significant investments in television including the US where ESPN is the leader in sport and happens to be a significant linear platform and in South America and in other parts of the world.
So I think the great thing with Disney globally is that there is no broad brush approach to how they want to do business. It is uniquely catering to the regions and the realities of the region in terms of the media and entertainment ecosystem, as well as where we believe opportunities for growth are and going after those opportunities for growth with a fiscal discipline that ensures the viability of that business case over a period of time.
ARIJIT: You touched upon a very important point, the viability. Now, if TV is. What you're betting on and you want to go strong, double down. The obvious question is why then did Disney or Star sub licence the ICC rights to Zee? That defies logic.
SANJOG: So let me answer this in two parts. One part is, as you said, where we believe growth lies. And the other part is what is the scale of investment to make that growth happen? Combine the two and you get financial viability over a period of time. The strategy with respect to IPL has to do with the nature of the property. When it comes to ICC it comes down to the scale of investment that needed to be made and how pivotal was that property for our TV portfolio compared to how critical was that property for our digital portfolio and what is the right price for that property on that platform. It's not a broad brush approach to both platforms and all properties. A bilateral series may be more valuable for TV than it is for digital. Multilateral property may be more valuable for digital than it is for tv because the two platforms are very different. We are not trying to build a strategy which looks to grow two very different platforms with very different consumer behaviors in the same way, the approach on TV and digital is actually unique based on the property its role in the portfolio. How over indexed or overweight we are on investments in that portfolio on a singular property. And finally, where we believe the genuine growth of that property lies, and on which platform. And all those reasons, our strategy for IPL looks very different from I C C and which may continue to look very different in the future.
ARIJIT: When we talk of growth, has the metro growth plateaued for TV? And as a consequence, are you losing premium consumers, high ARPU consumers to smart devices and digital?
SANJOG: The short answer to that is data suggests we are not. Our reach on HD is at its highest for any IPL till date. We have added more than 11 million subscribers to Star Sports during the course of IPL, and these are paying subscribers. These are not viewers who have been added by virtue of the property being available as wide as possible. We have busted the myth that premium viewers are no longer attracted to TV.
ARIJIT: Let me get to the elephant in [00:20:00] the room. There have been claims that digital revenues for the first time is higher than tv. Straight question, straight answer, yes
SANJOG: or no. I don't know what the revenues are for the digital platform. Okay. So it's hard for me to say if the digital revenues are higher or not. Okay. This is one of those, uh, metrics that's not comparable because frankly speaking, one, both quantities don't disclose, uh, exactly.
ARIJIT: What's the, what's the feedback that you get from the trade?
SANJOG: The feedback from, from the trade has largely been positive. I, I think if you look at how the tournament has gone on, we've seen a significant scale up in the sell through rates for IPL.
ARIJIT: But startups who are big spenders pulled out largely. Lot of belt tightening all across advertisers and advertising spends. Let me ask this directly.. Have you reached your revenue target on year one?
SANJOG: I will answer that in two parts. One, do we believe we have maximized the revenue potential of IPL in a single edition? There is immense head room for growth which means that the viewership, which we have delivered this year, and the records that have been made, give us the ideal launchpad for monetization to grow at a much faster clip than we had initially projected on the back of it.
ARIJIT: Is this a cryptic way of saying could have been better?
SANJOG: It can always be better. Right. Um, do, did we have a hundred percent sell through across the board for all the inventory that was available on IPL? No. But did we have enough sponsors growing, sell through rates and a large number of advertisers, almost a hundred at last count: Yes. We always see potential for growth and thus are seeing this as an opportunity to grow revenues at a faster clip.
ARIJIT: Because some are speculating there's been a 30% revenue shortfall. Your rivals it's actually 50% shortfall.
SANJOG: I think the shortfall with respect to what our targets are is not really one in the domain of the larger ecosystem. And two, it’s a, it's a metric or it's an observation, which to my mind is really not relevant, and I'll tell you why.
One, just in terms of the business viability, because fundamentally the question is, does the business of IPL work for the linear platform. Does it make money for the linear platform, Firstly, it's a five year investment. Which means that the recovery of investment needs to happen over five years.
ARIJIT: But there's a $3 billion meter (Disney -Star bid) that is already running?
SANJOG: Of course the clock is ticking and the first year really sets you up for, for those five years. I think we have set ourselves up really well for those five years by delivering record breaking viewership on one side and reaching a threshold of monetization, which gives us the confidence that once the externalities change, we will be on a really good pathway towards delivering to the business objectives. The second part of this is also, don't forget we have significant affiliate revenue which also accrues to the business and to
IPL. Because subscribers are paying for Star Sports. So ad revenues are only one stream of revenue for us. It is significant, but it is not the only stream of revenue. Typically, ad revenues to affiliate revenues for sports range from anything between 50 to 70% on the ad side. and 30 to 50% on the affiliate side, depending on the property itself. So it is a significant share of the revenue.
ARIJIT: We've spoken a lot about IPL. Now what next? Where does STAR Sports go from here? There is a 50 over ICC World Cup coming up and it's on Star. How are you padding up for that?
SANJOG: I know you are a test match fan, so there's a big test match coming up first. Yes. I don't know why you are choosing to ignore that and go straight to the World Cup. It's an ICC trophy that India can lift after a decade. So I agree. The WTC final is on from the seventh.
We are focused on that now. Yeah. It happens to be on Star Sports and on Disney Plus HotStar. So it's also Cricket coming back to HotStar. After which there is an Asia Cup, which really is the precursor to the World Cup. The event coincides with the festive season. It's also the return of the World Cup to India after 12 years for the ODI. And so while we were executing on our plans for IPL 2023, we were already looking ahead to how we make the Asia Cup and the World Cup, the biggest additions in 2023 of those events, and also how we will deliver to the WTC final.
ARIJIT: How much of revenue dependencies would you link the next two or three mega events that are coming up?
SANJOG: I think it's not fair for me to comment on, uh, revenue dependencies. There is significant revenue riding on the World Cup. Because of the event being at home, during du Diwali, which is the peak, spending period for advertisers. And obviously a favorite for fans. So on all counts that event has significant revenue expectations built in and significant viewership expectations built in as well.
ARIJIT: We have seen an explosion of short videos, attention spans are going down. Does it have a bearing on the way we watch longer version of the match?
SANJOG: If the figures are to be believed, then it has definite bearing on the viewership. Viewing patterns, as you said, are changing and changing dramatically. Having said that, the nature of these two events that you just referred to, one, the World Test Championship final and the other, the ODI World Cup is such that it aggregates viewers at scale.
And it drives a significant increase in the number of sessions that a viewer engages with a game for. So if you were to ask me a general, Broad brush trend around viewing patterns, then yes, longer formats will continue to face a challenge with viewer retention and engagement, but marque events will continue to enjoy the benefit of unmissability and a heightened sense of FOMO attached with those events.

, the streaming service backed by Asia’s richest man
Mukesh Ambani
, netted a record number of viewers for the Indian
Premier
League final — the wildly popular short-format cricket tournament whose digital rights were secured by the billionaire last year.
About 32 million concurrent viewers tuned into the free-to-watch airing of the rain-delayed, then shortened, match, said a spokesperson for Viacom18, the joint venture between Ambani and Paramount Global that owns JioCinema. The close clash, held in the 130,000-person capacity Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, saw popular veteran Mahendra Singh Dhoni lead the Chennai Super Kings to a fifth league title.
Viewership was likely boosted by speculation the final would be 41-year-old Dhoni’s last professional appearance, though the former Indian captain signaled he’s likely to return to next year’s tournament.
Focus now turns to whether JioCinema can turn the success of free-to-watch
IPL
into paid subscriptions. Ambani’s conglomerate
Reliance Industries Ltd
. has aspirations to become a global media behemoth and JioCinema has already started charging for content after acquiring rights to HBO and
Warner
Bros Discovery Inc. shows as it takes on giants like Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc. in the massive Indian market.
Ambani’s media venture outbid companies including Disney to clinch the digital rights to IPL, though Disney — which is facing an exodus of paid subscribers — bagged the television broadcast rights. With a year until the next IPL season kicks off, it’s unclear whether JioCinema can maintain its growth and scale, Mihir Shah, the India vice president at consultancy Media Partners Asia, said in a report this month.

Cricket Revolution
The IPL has revolutionized cricket since its inception in 2008, bringing Bollywood glamor and American sporting glitz to the stereotypically genteel sport.
While the shift away from tradition has put off some fans, others have been enticed by the shorter and brasher format that typically sees a match only last around four hours. Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai is one of them, tweeting his congratulations and commiserations.

GT vs MI match sets new world record with 2.57 crore concurrent viewers,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jiocinema-gujarat-titans-vs-mumbai-indians-ipl-match-sets-new-world-record-with-2-57-crore-concurrent-viewers/articleshow/100545729.cms,27-05-2023,"Mumbai:
JioCinema
, the official digital streaming partner of the IPL, has set a new world record of 2.57 crore concurrent viewers who witnessed the sensational century by
Shubhman Gill
in the first innings of Qualifier 2 of the
IPL
2023 between
Gujarat Titans
and Mumbai Indians.
The previous record was held by Disney+ Hotstar, which had 2.53 crore concurrent viewers during the India vs. New Zealand semi-final in the ICC 2019 World Cup.
JioCinema said its IPL 2023 presentation has continuously set new benchmarks and shattered records almost every week through the season, evidence of cricket fans’ preference.
On April 17, 2.4 crore viewers came together to watch MS Dhoni’s CSK defend against a high-octane run chase from Royal Challengers Bangalore with bated breath at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. This record was set after bettering the one set on April 12th, when peak concurrency touched 2.2 crore, and again when Dhoni almost pulled off another heist against the Rajasthan Royals.
“We are thrilled to announce that JioCinema has set a ground-breaking milestone by breaking the world record of concurrent viewers on digital,” said Viacom18 Sports CEO Anil Jayaraj. “It is a testament to our constant endeavour to offer an unparalleled experience of the IPL to fans and viewers across every corner of the country. The achievement reinforces our commitment to deliver world-class sports action, no matter the scale, and motivates us to constantly push the boundaries of live sports streaming.”

In the case of cinemas, they are getting only a minimum guarantee since revenue is not breaching that threshold.
""Currently, we are in the advanced stage of fitting out about 175 screens, which we plan to open this year. We have a very robust pipeline of a similar number of screens, which are coming up for handover this year. But in view of the huge amount of volatility at the box office that we have seen, we want that to stabilise before we take the next leg of screens for handover and start fitting them out,"" said PVR Inox. ""And keeping that in mind, we delayed all new handovers that are coming up.""
PVR Inox
recorded a decline in footfall to 140 million in 2022-23 from 168 million in 2019-20. Malls expect that the movie line-up from July onwards will revive the industry, said industry executives.
""Cinemas reported 27% occupancy in the last three months but in May the occupancy increased to 40%. At 40%, we hit the revenue share and though the last three months have been tough, we hope cinemas to bounce back,"" said Harsh V Bansal, co-founder of the Unity group, which operates about half-dozen malls in Delhi and Punjab.
Rajendra Kalkar, president-west at
Phoenix Mills
, which operates more than half-dozen malls in Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, and in some tier-2 cities, also said that revenue from cinemas had dipped but May has seen some improvement.
""There is a clear trend of occupancy of cinemas going down and PVR also announced shutting of about 50 screens. Future malls may plan to reconsider the size and number of screens and add more alternate entertainment options on higher floors,"" said Shriram PM Monga, co-founder of retail consultancy firm SRED.
PVR Inox said that May is looking better than what it had anticipated.
""April, of course, has been slow, but then July picks up again with a lot of big movies coming. We are expecting much better content, starting May-June onwards. Q2 and Q3 are looking quite good on paper based on the content flow we have,"" the company said.
Operating costs for theatres also increased in 2022-23 as most of the rebates offered during the Covid-19 pandemic ended.
""Cinema as a category will continue to give an advantage to malls as Indians like going out for movies. There will be phases when movies won't do good, impacting the revenue, and that is likely to be covered by releases that will be blockbusters,"" said Muhammad Ali, CEO of Forum Malls of Prestige group.
PVR-Inox added 79 screens in the fourth quarter of 2022-23, taking the additions during the financial year to 168 screens. In the current fiscal, the company intends to open another 150-175 screens.
Of these, nine screens have opened till date, 15 are awaiting licence for commercial openings and 152 screens are currently under various stages of fit-out. The company has also decided to shut down about 50 screens over the next six months across the country.

After the preview, I asked the director, “How did you even shoot so many tough sequences? (includes a lot of flooding and water) He replied “3.5 years of hard work!” What’s commendable is they achieved a lot of it via practical effects.

According to officials, the use of tobacco products and smoking are shown extensively in web series and movies streamed on OTT platforms and without any disclaimers in clear violation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003.
""The OTT platforms, because of their huge popularity, play a crucial role in promoting tobacco use among children and youth in our country,"" an official said.
Ranjit Singh, an advocate in the
Supreme Court
said amendment to the rules will truly make
India
a world champion in regulating tobacco promotion through entertainment medium.
""The morbidity and mortality due to tobacco use are well established. The government enacted COTPA to discourage tobacco use by eliminating all direct and indirect advertisements of tobacco.
""The tobacco industry aims to get the youngsters hooked to tobacco... The ban on tobacco advertisements under COTPA led to a spurt of incidents of promotion of tobacco through entertainment medium,"" Singh said.
Binoy Mathew
, programme manager at the
Voluntary Health Association of India
, said that streaming services have gained immense popularity, especially during the Covid pandemic and among teens.
""Teens in school uniform smoking tobacco were being shown quite frequently. There were also scenes where tobacco control laws and their intent were ridiculed. The draft notification, once issued, will end brazen tobacco promotion on OTT platforms,"" Mathew said.
India will become a global leader in tobacco regulation by implementing the regulation on OTT. India can set an example to the world, he said.
According to the proposed amendments to the Rules, the display of tobacco products or their use in online curated content will not be extended to the display of
brands
of cigarettes or other tobacco products.
If the publishers fail to comply with the provisions an inter-ministerial committee consisting of representatives from the ministries of health, information and broadcasting and electronics and information technology shall issue notice giving reasonable opportunity to them giving reasonable opportunity to explain such failure and make appropriate modifications in the content, another source said.
""According to the daft notification, ""online curated content"" means any curated catalogue of audio-visual content, other than news and current affairs, which is owned by, licensed to or contracted to be transmitted by a publisher of online curated content and made available on demand over the internet or computer networks.
""It includes films, audio-visual programmes, documentaries, television programmes, serials, series, podcasts and other such content,"" the source added.

""It's been more than a week now and we have not yet received any response from the Dish TV management. We have informed the MCA to ensure that Dish TV's current management takes the necessary steps to comply with the requisition notice that we have sent,"" Vis Legis Law Practice founder and partner Rahul Hingmire, who is also the spokesperson for Dish TV minority shareholders, told ET.
Live Events
In a statement, Dish TV said it will be taking the required steps as per the provisions of law. The company also termed the association's letter to the MCA “premature”.
""As already intimated, the company shall take all such steps as are required in terms of the provisions of the Companies Act and Sebi’s LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) in respect of the requisition. As regards your statement that a letter has been sent by the minority shareholder association to MCA, the company is neither aware of nor in possession of such a letter. If at all any such letter has been written, it is premature,"" the company said.
The association wants to hold an EGM to appoint K Badri Narayanan, Satish Kumar Yanmandra and Jeet Sen Gupta as non-executive independent directors and remove Shankar Aggarwal and Rashmi Aggarwal from the board.
While accusing the board of working at the behest of certain minority shareholders, the association had also highlighted the poor financial performance of the company in the last couple of years.
On receiving the May 15 letter, Dish TV had said it was examining the communication and that it would take necessary steps as per applicable laws and procedures.
On Tuesday, Dish TV announced that its CEO Anil Dua would be leaving the company after a six-year stint. Manoj Dobhal, who is currently serving as the COO, has been named CEO-designate to replace Dua.
To ensure a smooth transition, Dua would be at the helm of Dish TV for three more months. Dobhal would be the CEO-designate until the requisite regulatory approval from the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) is received, the company had said.

ZEE Entertainment to move appellate body against NCLT order,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/zee-entertainment-to-move-appellate-body-against-nclt-order/articleshow/100456492.cms,24-05-2023,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises
(ZEEL) is set to move the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (
NCLAT
) against the National Company Law Tribunal's (
NCLT
) May 11 order, a source close to the development told ET.
The source further stated that the NCLT order will be challenged on the grounds that ZEEL was not provided adequate opportunity to present its side of the argument, and the fact that the NCLT doesn't have jurisdiction over issues like non-compete fees.
“The NCLT order will be challenged before the NCLAT in a day or two,” the source said.
On May 11, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT directed the National Stock Exchange and the
BSE
to reconsider their respective initial approvals for the Zee-Sony union and issue updated no-objection certificates before the next hearing, posing fresh obstacles for the proposed merger of the media companies.
The division bench, headed by judicial member HV Subba Rao and technical member Madhu Sinha, will now hear the case on June 16.

The NCLT has instructed the exchanges to reassess and validate the non-compete clause of the merger, which had previously received approval from both the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The NCLT directive to the exchanges comes after an adverse interim ruling by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on a promoter entity of the Essel Group, which is the also promoter of ZEEL.
The stock exchanges have also been directed to review whether the payment method for the non-compete fee between two Mauritius entities complies with the relevant Sebi policies.
Under the terms of the proposed deal, Sony Pictures Entertainment will indirectly hold a majority of 50.86% in the combined company, while the founders of Zee will own 3.99%, and 45.15% will be with the other shareholders of Zee, including the public. Sony will also pay a non-compete fee of Rs 1,100 crore to the Essel Group promoters.

Average ticket prices have now crossed pre-Covid levels for most locations. The company closed FY23 with average ticket price of Rs 236 (for the merged entity) against Rs 204 (PVR standalone) in pre-Covid FY20.
Currently, the company is making plans to expand to a number of tier-2 and -3 cities, including locations such as Rourkela, Bhubaneswar, Dharwad, Cuddalore, Jodhpur, Hubli, and Ajmer.
PVR and Inox, two highly popular rival chains in India, merged last year take advantage of their synergies tackle lockdown-related challenges and the rising popularity of Netflix, Amazon, Disney Hotstar and other streaming companies.
PVR Inox announced cumulative numbers for the merged entity last week. It reported a net loss of Rs 334 crore and revenues of Rs 1,143 crore for January-March. The company said it would close down 50 loss-making screens that are now financially unviable or are at the end of lifecycle.
The company currently runs 1,689 screens across 361 cinemas.
Bijli expects the synergies to boost the operating profits of the merged entity in a big way. ""We are targeting to deliver Rs 225 crore of annual recurring ebitda synergies over 12-24 months. Currently more than 75% of our screens are in Metros and tier-1 cities. But we are entering new cities every year and will expand footprint in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, where multiplexes haven't been experienced till now,"" he told ToI.

Our goal is to establish ourselves as a leader in the industry and a go-to destination for high-quality content while maintaining our position as a leading player in the media and entertainment industry.
To what extent has the pandemic fast-tracked the digital transformation journeys of businesses such as yours?
As a media company, we have embraced the trend of digital transformation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, investing in innovative technologies and infrastructure, expanding our offerings, and producing original content.
The pandemic has increased demand for digital channels and streaming services, presenting an opportunity for growth and innovation in the media and entertainment industry.
In this hyper-competitive market, staying ahead of the curve requires investing in cutting-edge technology to meet the changing needs and demands of our audiences.
With competition in the OTT space intensifying, it is a battle not just for providing engaging content but also a seamless user experience. Your views?
In the OTT space, providing superior customer experience is essential, and we believe personalisation, responsive design, high-quality content, smooth playback, responsive customer support, and engagement are key components.
By integrating Metaverse, and NFT (non-fungible token) technology, we can offer our customers an immersive experience. Using data and analytics, we personalise content recommendations and user interface, and we have also incorporated voice search and control features.
Interactive features such as polls, quizzes, and games increase engagement, while we also prioritise smooth playback experience by improving playback speed and quality. Our efforts have led to increased customer satisfaction and retention, giving us a competitive edge in the market.
How are you using big data, analytics and machine learning to understand and cater to the needs of your customers better?
We recognise the importance of understanding and catering to the needs of our customers in the best way possible. To achieve this, we utilise big data, analytics, and machine learning techniques to gain insights into customer behaviour. By analysing customer data, such as viewing history and search queries, we can identify patterns and trends to personalise recommendations and offers that align with customer preferences.
This not only helps predict customer behaviour but also provides a seamless and frictionless customer experience. By leveraging these technologies, we can stay ahead of the curve and continue to meet and exceed our customers' expectations.
Can you elaborate on monetisation of OTT from the AVOD (Advertising based
Video on Demand
) standpoint? How are you leveraging technology for personalised targeting of ads and branded content?
We balance user experience and ad revenue generation in our AVOD monetisation strategy through advanced technologies like DMPs (data management platform), programmatic advertising, server-side ad insertion, and contextual advertising. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based content recommendation engines personalise customer experiences and drive revenue.
Personalised recommendations and offers are tailored to customer preferences based on analysis of viewing history and search queries, helping us predict customer behaviour and provide a seamless customer experience.
How can we expect technology to further enhance our OTT viewing experience?
We have exciting non-linear initiatives in place to enhance the OTT viewing experience for our customers.
Personalised content recommendations and the use of AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality) are just a few examples of the technologies we are exploring to improve customer engagement and retention. By analysing viewing history, preferences, and behaviour of our viewers, we can offer tailored content suggestions.
What did cloud technology allow you to do that you couldn't do before?
As we moved to cloud, we achieved cost optimisation, increased scalability, and flexibility of operations. AWS helped us achieve reliable and high-performing content delivery to a wider audience by leveraging its global infrastructure and CDN services. With the help of automated solutions and tools, AWS allowed us to better manage and monitor our resources and security.
In summary, cloud technology and AWS helped us achieve our goal of delivering high-quality content to our customers in a secure and scalable manner.
Can you elaborate on the technology pillars that support ZEE5 and how do you manage to cater to the massive subscriber growth ZEE5 has brought in?
Our platform relies on cloud-native technology and AWS services, such as Elemental Media Services, S3, CloudFront, and container orchestration, for on-demand scaling, content delivery, and security. By using microservices, containers, and distributed databases, we prioritise automation, continuous integration and delivery, and fault tolerance to enhance customer experience.
AWS facilitates our rapid growth by enabling infrastructure scaling and new feature deployment, and we strive to optimise costs and operational efficiency while providing seamless customer experiences.
To keep up with the pace of growth and change in the technology landscape, did you take any modernisation initiatives towards the ZEE5 platform since it was launched in 2018?
We continuously modernise our platform to keep pace with the evolving technology landscape and changing customer demands. Since the launch of ZEE5 in 2018, we have migrated to a microservices-based architecture, adopted container orchestration, and implemented deployment pipelines for faster feature delivery.
We use cloud-native technologies and services like AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and
SNS
(Amazon Simple Notification Service) for serverless computing and event-driven architectures.
In terms of business outcomes, what benefits have you experienced as a result of running on AWS?
Moving our operations to AWS has brought us significant benefits, including improved business process performance, faster time-to-market for new products and features, and better risk management.
With the pay-as-you-go pricing model and scalability offered by AWS, we have avoided large upfront investments in infrastructure, reduced costs, and effectively utilised our resources.
The agility and scalability of AWS have enabled us to quickly develop and deploy innovative solutions, reducing latency and enhancing availability to better serve our customers.

Totoki noted that Sony began its journey in India with electronics and later expanded into entertainment. ""Now, the proportion of entertainment is bigger than electronics in India. We feel that this is a compelling market,"" he said.
He also sounded bullish on India's future growth prospects. ""In Asia, India is showing the fastest growth rate,"" Totoki added.
Talking about the company's core philosophy of kando (which translates to the power of emotional connection), Yoshida said Sony has been spreading kando in India since the 1980s. ""Sony India, which leads the electronics business, has been providing products that create and deliver kando,"" he stated.
He added that the company's music label, Sony Music
Entertainment India
, holds more than 20% market share in India and is engaged in expanding the local music business through the creation of new labels and the acquisition of Bollywood music catalogues.
SPNI, he said, delivers Kando content through media networks and a direct-to-consumer (DTC) service, which it started operating in 2013.
He added that Crunchyroll, which is also available in India, has been streaming Hindi-dubbed content since last year. The Sony Corp.-owned streaming service is billed as the world's largest anime streaming service.
""Going forward, we would like to further expand creation rooted in local culture through our expected merger with ZEEL,"" he stated.
NP Singh, who has been with SPNI for over two decades in key executive roles, said in his presentation that the merger deal with ZEEL will help the company expand its Kando content creation capabilities.
""In 2021, we announced the signing of a deal to merge ZEEL into SPNI, which upon closing will enable us to expand our Kando content creation and strengthen our connection with diverse communities within India. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals,"" he said.
Singh said India’s M&E industry is expected to reach a market size of over $60 billion with a CAGR of 10% by 2030.
He stated that the SPNI has 26 channels reaching 700 million viewers in 167 countries. He also highlighted that SonyLIV has 40,000+ hours of content in eight languages and 33.3 million subscribers, including partner platforms.
""SPNI has made significant investments in sports, including key cricket properties, UEFA tournaments, World Wrestling Entertainment, and Grand Slam tennis, to name a few,"" he said.
Sony also said that SPNI's Hindi GEC, Sony Entertainment Television India's YouTube channel, is the third-most subscribed channel in the world with 156 million global subscribers.
He also revealed that SPNI and Sony Research India have collaborated to develop AI models such as video analytics, recommendation engines, and speech recognition. Singh also noted that SPNI has teamed with Sony Music and Sony Interactive Entertainment to support local Indian artists and game development talent.

The combined
Zee-Sony group
had a 13% premium VOD category share in aggregate with their respective platforms, which are expected to operate separately for another year, benefiting from strong engagement across content. Jio Cinema's share of the premium VOD category was 2%, as the measurement period in this report ended in Q1 2023, before the launch of the Indian
Premier
League (IPL) on Jio Cinema. Jio Cinema's consumption surged more than 20 times in April 2023 due to the IPL.
Prime, Netflix
Prime Video and Netflix had an aggregate 10% share of premium VOD category minutes.
It added Prime Video continues to benefit from a good mix of content across genres and languages, with crime, thrillers, and action and adventure leading the way. Prime Video gets over 60% of its viewership from local content. In contrast, it said a quarter of Netflix India's viewership comes from local content since the platform's Indian originals have been unable to sustain buzz for long periods of time.
Netflix's major US titles have achieved sustained viewership.
The report highlighted that Indian content dominates premium VOD viewership outside of sports. Content viewership on paid tiers was led by international content, which contributed 51% of total paid tier premium VOD consumption over 2022-23, it added.

Higher F&B revenue of little help to multiplexes if movies fail to impress,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/higher-fb-revenue-of-little-help-to-multiplexes-if-movies-fail-to-impress/articleshow/100312816.cms,18-05-2023,"The share of food and beverages (F&B) revenue in the total revenue generated by key multiplexes has been increasing amid falling footfalls and rising prices of such items. However, they may not be able to raise prices further if the footfalls fail to show an uptick.
According to the data shared by PVR, India's largest multiplex by screen count, the F&B share has increased to 30% in FY23 from 27% in FY20 including Inox's operations after the merger. During the period, the share of revenue from ticket sales in total income fell to 51.8% from nearly 53% even though
PVR
raised the average ticket price (ATP) by 16.2%.
The falling footfalls and lower advertising revenue have affected the operating profitability of multiplexes.
Karan Taurani
, senior vice president and research analyst at Elara Capital mentioned that the box office collections and revenue for key multiplexes were almost similar between FY20 and FY23 and still, the operating margin (Ebitda margin) fell. ""This is largely because of lower footfalls and advertising revenue,"" Taurani said.
Between FY20 and FY23, the number of admissions and advertising revenue in PVR fell by 16.6% and 31% respectively while the Ebitda margins of the combined operations of PVR and Inox fell to 11.5% from 17.9% in FY20.
Live Events
During the same period, these multiplex players were able to increase food and beverage costs by 29-30% since in recent years they changed their food menu by including high-end items.
In the coming quarters, analysts foresee little room for multiplexes to increase average ticket and F&B prices as they believe that the line-up of films is not strong enough to generate high footfalls. ""There is not much confidence in the trade circuits about the future line-up of films. Therefore, footfalls may not improve materially,"" an analyst, requesting anonymity said.

For the full 12 months,
Inox
and PVR recorded combined revenue of Rs 5,300 crore in FY23, while the combined
EBITDA
was Rs 610 crore, he stated.
It is pertinent to note that the
PVR-Inox merger
became effective on January 1, 2023. The two companies reported results separately for the first nine months of FY23.
He added that the operating margins may take some time to reach the pre-pandemic level. ""Our focus will be getting back to 18–20% margins very quickly,"" he noted.
In FY24, PVR Inox is looking to open 175 screens. The two companies had launched 168 screens in 30 cinemas in the previous fiscal year.
The company’s screen portfolio stands at 1,689 screens across 361 cinemas in 115 cities in India and Sri Lanka.
""We have 175 screens under fit-out this year that will open during the year in various parts of the country. The bulk of these screens will open in the next 6–9 months,"" he stated, adding that 40–45% of the screens will come up in the South.
The company’s capex will be Rs 700 crore in FY24, compared to the combined capex of Rs 750–800 crore last fiscal. ""Our overall capex, including what we are building as new screens and renovations/upgrades, will be Rs 700 crore in FY24,"" he noted.
Sood said PVR Inox is only focused on working with top-quality shopping mall developers. The company will add new screens in markets that are under-screened. ""South will continue to remain a
prime focus
area for us. Other than that, we will also focus on destination malls,"" he said.
On PVR Inox’s plan to shut down 50 screens in the next six months, Sood said that these screens have become obsolete as they were built in shopping centers 15 years ago.
""Those have got replaced with new flagship cinemas in better quality malls and shopping centers. They have come to the end of their lifecycle and hence the decision to shut them down,"" he added.

""I must confess that the film 'Section 84' IPC is taking a lot out of me as far as the nature of the film and role is, which is why when the day work is done it does not leave you even as you set off for home .. much of it remains in the head and body and as is often the matter with the profession, it remains a pleasant disturbance .."" Bachchan wrote.

""JioCinema has built a strong customer base on the back of IPL,"" said Kurate Digital Consulting senior partner Uday Sodhi. ""They will use this base to create a premium subscription business. An SVoD (subscription video on demand) business on the back of a strong AVoD (advertising video on demand) business is the right way to go in markets like India. Hotstar, SonyLIV and Zee5 have built successful subscription businesses after building a large AVoD user base.""
But Elara Capital senior vice president Karan Taurani believes that JioCinema will not get a large paid subscriber base from the Hollywood premium plan. ""The Indian audience is value-driven and may not pay this much (₹999/year) only for HBO and
Warner
Bros content,"" he said.
He, however, added that an ad-free subscription plan with HBO and Warner Bros content will help JioCinema target premium households. ""Jio Cinema may also bundle the HBO/Warner Bros content free for their premium Jio Fibre subs or postpaid mobile subs, which have a higher ARPU (average revenue per user),"" he said.
Viacom18 had last month inked a multi-year, multi-million dollar deal with Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) for acquiring the streaming and TV rights of HBO, Max Original and Warner Bros content in India. The company will be paying upwards of $20 million in annual licence fees to WBD.
Singapore-based research company Media Partners Asia had earlier said in a report that Viacom18's subscription service is expected to have content from Paramount+ besides WBD.
It also said Viacom18's streaming service Voot, which had 6 million subscribers at the end of 2022, is expected to get integrated with JioCinema in the second half of 2023.
As reported earlier, JioCinema will also be the default home for more than 100 movies and web shows that JioStudios will be rolling out over the next 18-24 months. The
Reliance
Industries-owned content studio has spent upwards of ₹2,000 crore on producing over 100 titles.

Music streaming has a $2 billion fraud problem that goes beyond AI,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/music-streaming-has-a-2-billion-fraud-problem-that-goes-beyond-ai/articleshow/100189992.cms,12-05-2023,"Staring at his computer screen, Kristoffer Rom couldn’t believe the numbers rolling in from
Spotify
.
A year and a half earlier, in 2018, his independent music label, Tambourhinoceros, had released a languid, synth-pop song, titled Hey Kids, by Molina, a Danish-Chilean singer. The initial reception was modest. But then, months later, it started taking off on TikTok and YouTube as creators embraced the song as a catchy, mood-setting score for all manner of emotive videos and animations.
From there, the momentum spread to Spotify, Apple Music and other
streaming
services. By March 2022, the song was generating more than 100,000 streams per day. “It was amazing to see all that traction,” Rom said.
But his team’s initial excitement was soon tempered by an unsettling realization. The growing popularity of Hey Kids had not only caught the attention of TikTok and YouTube performers but also another more pernicious, if less widely recognized, mainstay of the modern media ecosystem — streaming music scammers. Taking advantage of the loose restrictions in an age of automated music distribution, such scammers have learned how to rake in money from mainstream music platforms, either by circulating minimally altered, copycat versions of popular songs and collecting the resulting per-stream payouts or by getting listeners to inadvertently consume their own music or ads by mislabeling uploaded content.
Much to Rom’s growing dismay, ripped-off versions of Hey Kids — slightly modified but largely indistinguishable from the real thing — were suddenly proliferating across the streaming music landscape, siphoning listeners away from Molina and unfairly pocketing the resulting streaming royalties. Worse yet, nobody at the major services appeared to be doing anything effective to stop the spread of the knockoffs.

“You have the ecstatic joy of people doing creative, great things with the music you’ve put out, on the one hand,” Rom said. “And the total frustration and anger of witnessing people trying to exploit it.”
Currently, much of the music industry is preoccupied with the newest threat — or maybe opportunity — to emerge from Silicon Valley. With AI-generated songs of mysterious provenance already going viral on streaming platforms, industry executives, most notably Spotify Technology SA Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek, have been quick to promise heightened vigilance on behalf of labels, artists and copyright holders. But while the platforms are warily sizing up the shiny new disruptive force, labels and managers say that fraud of a more prosaic nature is already rampant.
Beatdapp, a company that works with services to detect and remove fraud, estimates that at least 10% of streaming activity is fraudulent. Applied across a vast scale of digital music, what can at first appear as small-time, garden-variety trickery adds up to sizable theft. Beatdapp said that the streaming subterfuge could amount to roughly $2 billion in misallocated revenue every year.
People in the music industry who spoke with Bloomberg say the majority of the problems they grapple with tend to surface on the biggest global streaming platforms, Spotify and Apple Music. By contrast, they say, Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube Music has been much cleaner. That’s in part because YouTube has for years maintained a powerful content ID system that often identifies infringing content and then allows rightsholders to either remove the fraudulent content entirely or monetize it themselves. (Unauthorized versions of Hey Kids on YouTube, for example, now divert any resulting ad revenue back to Molina’s team at Tambourhinoceros.)
A Spotify spokesperson said via email that “stream manipulation and content misrepresentation are industry-wide issues,” which it “takes seriously” and are “against our policies.”
“We have robust, active mitigation measures in place that identify bad actors, limit their impact and penalize them accordingly, including withholding royalties,” the spokesperson wrote. “We are continuously evolving our efforts to limit the impact of such individuals on our service.”
Apple Music didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Ben Gaffin, an artist manager and founder of Sound Advice, a music-services business that represents producers, artists and media companies, said he often encounters a particular type of streaming scam. Someone will make a track and distribute it across the streaming services while intentionally tagging it with the name of another, more successful artist. Afterward, thanks to the fallacious metadata, the platform’s algorithms will start automatically serving up the mislabeled track to the legions of fans of the real musician and incorporating it into popular playlists, generating a surge of unwarranted streams.
Sometimes, lesser-known artists will use this trick to try and draft attention from a popular act. Other times, the deceptively tagged track isn’t even a song but rather a speaker urging listeners to buy something on a particular website. Basically, a rogue ad.
During a recent interview with Bloomberg, Gaffin began hunting around for an example and quickly found one such track “featuring” his artist Clams Casino. By the time Gaffin happened upon it, the mis-tagged track had already tallied up over 55,000 plays on Spotify. Gaffin said he typically only finds out about counterfeits when he gets a notification from Spotify For Artists alerting him to new music being ready for release when, in fact, no new work is planned — or, when fans start posting angrily about a new track they dislike.
“It’s a vulnerability in the system that is being exploited,” Gaffin said.
Talya Elitzer, co-founder of the label Godmode Music, sees the same tactic targeting her artists a couple times a month. Often, she said, it takes streaming platforms up to a week to process her takedown requests.
“It seems like a fairly easy fix that every artist should have a code or security thing,” Elitzer said. “By the time you see it, it’s too late.”
Part of the challenge is that in the streaming age, more or less anyone can get tracks uploaded onto major streaming platforms with little scrutiny or oversight. There are many services, such as DistroKid, CD Baby, and TuneCore, that empower users to distribute their songs to the big platforms using do-it-yourself software. The process of distributing new music to retailers, which not long ago was a labor-intensive, hands-on process, has grown largely automated.
“Way, way, way back in the day, we had a team of people that listened to every CD that came in the door,” said Christine Barnum, the chief revenue officer at CD Baby. “Operating at this scale, that’s not feasible.""
As the amount of amateur content being uploaded to streaming services has exploded, businesses like Spotify that were originally set up as outlets for professional musicians have started to look more like user-generated content platforms. Spotify said over 100 million songs exist on its service, and as of February 2021, 60,000 tracks per day were being uploaded. Apple Music and Amazon Music also recently said they offer listeners a 100-million-song catalog.
Vickie Nauman, founder and CEO of CrossBorderWorks, a music and technology consultancy, said that the growing scale at which streaming services operate is making it much easier for dishonestly labeled tracks to slip through.
“Certainly in the world before we had 100,000 songs uploaded a day, it was easier to monitor,” she said.
For the most part, the task of swatting down scammers falls on rightsholders who must manually submit takedown requests for each problematic track they identify, a process that can be particularly burdensome for small, independent labels.
To this day, executives at Tambourhinoceros continue to find new uploads ripping off Hey Kids. On some, the fraudsters have changed the name of the song, luring in unsuspecting listeners with variations of hashtags used on TikTok. Others feature slightly sped-up or slowed-down versions, seemingly tweaked to avoid fraud detection software while still sounding almost identical to the original work.
The most popular bogus upload they uncovered had accumulated more than 700,000 plays, possibly accounting for over $2,000 in lost revenue.
“That’s a lot of money for anybody but especially us, an independent label from Denmark,” Rom said. “We really need to get the money from what we actually do.”

"Tariff hikes may push up cable, DTH companies subscription revenue",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/tariff-hikes-may-push-up-cable-dth-companies-subscription-revenue/articleshow/100168903.cms,11-05-2023,"The tariff hike by cable and
direct-to-home
(DTH) operators will help the companies amp up their subscription revenue following the lift in the pricing embargo by the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(Trai).
TV broadcasters have hiked the prices of their channels and bouquets following the notification of the New Tariff Order (NTO) 3.0 in November 2022.
Trai restored the MRP cap of '19 and removed the twin conditions, which were introduced to create a linkage between the price of individual channel prices and bouquets.
The recently released
FICCI-EY report
stated that TV subscription revenue declined for the third year in a row. It contracted 4% to '39,200 crore in 2022 due to a reduction of five million pay-TV homes and stagnant consumer-end ARPUs.
According to Crisil, the recent tariff hike by
DTH operators
will lead to 6-8% growth in their revenue to '19,500 crore in fiscal 2024, which is roughly 95% of the pre-pandemic revenue in fiscal 2020.

It added that the net subscriber addition in the DTH sector is expected to remain flat over the medium term due to subscriber migration to digital and DD Free Dish platforms, and stiff competition from
cable operators
.
Crisil Ratings Director Naveen Vaidyanathan said DTH's monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to grow 7-8% to '300-305 this fiscal.
""This would boost the sector's revenue, although it will still be 5% short of fiscal 2020 levels. Over the next few years, the sector should continue to grow moderately, driven by the expectation of further revisions in tariffs. That said, alternative platforms available to consumers for watching content may keep net subscriber additions flat.""
The CEO of a top cable TV company said that the subscription revenue of MSOs will increase by 4 to 6% following the tariff hike.

In its Q1 2023 results for the period ending December, Walt Disney reported that Disney+ Hotstar's paid subscriber base dropped by 3.8 million to 57.5 million from 61.3 million in the exit quarter of the fiscal year 2022. Walt Disney follows the October-September fiscal calendar.
In the first two quarters of fiscal 2023, Disney+ Hotstar's subscriber base saw a reduction of 8.4 million subscribers. Industry watchers say that the churn in the subscriber base can be attributed to the loss of Indian

The non-renewal of HBO is also expected to create a small dent in the platform's subscriber base, media analysts have said.
Disney+ Hotstar's average revenue per user (ARPU) decreased 20% to $0.59 from $0.74 in the prior quarter due to lower per-subscriber advertising revenue. The Star India-owned streaming service is available in India and certain other Southeast Asian countries.
Overall, Disney+'s paid subscriber base dropped by 2% to 157.8 million from 161.8 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a decline in Disney+ Hotstar's subscriber base and a marginal 1% dip in the home markets of the US and Canada.
Walt Disney's quarterly revenue from international channels decreased by 18% to $1.1 billion. The company's operating income decreased 65% to $85 million, primarily due to lower advertising revenue, which was partially offset by a decrease in programming costs.
The company said that the lower advertising revenue was due to decreases in impressions and rates and an unfavourable foreign exchange impact. Lower impressions were attributable to decreases in average viewership at the company's sports and non-sports channels.
It further added that the decrease in the viewership of sports channels was primarily due to the airing of fewer IPL matches in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter, as the 2023 IPL season started approximately one week later than the 2022 season.
The company noted that the decrease was partially offset by airing more
Board of Control for Cricket
in India matches in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter.

OTTs may not bankroll films with a poor box office show,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/otts-may-not-bankroll-films-with-a-poor-box-office-show/articleshow/100143181.cms,11-05-2023,"The share of
digital streaming platforms
in the total
revenue
generated by
films
is on the rise amid the expanding presence of such platforms. However, according to analysts, this trend may not continue in future as streaming platforms realign their budgets to improve the profitability of their operations.
The proportion of the revenue generated through the sale of digital rights in total revenue of films increased to around 21% in 2022 from nearly 10% in 2019. On the other hand, the share of revenue through the sale of television broadcast rights fell to 5.8% in 2022 from over 11% in 2019.
Due to the rising usage of over-the-top (OTT) platforms, production houses were able to compensate to a great extent for poor box-office revenue by increasing revenue from the sale of digital rights.
Karan Taurani, senior vice president at Elara Capital noted in a report that major studios and production houses which released films of big stars demanded high premiums on the sale of digital and OTT rights to streaming platforms. This premium increased the total revenue from films.
Live Events
However, in the coming months, analysts believe that the premium on the sale of digital and streaming rights may come down. According to Taurani, only quality films may get a premium on the sale of digital and OTT rights as streaming platforms plan to cut down costs by close to 30%. Such platforms are also asking producers to release films in cinemas first to gauge their commercial merit before allocating budgets.

Regional cinema goes mainstream as Bollywood lags,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/regional-cinema-goes-mainstream-as-bollywood-lags/articleshow/100057495.cms,07-05-2023,"Is
regional cinema
becoming the mainstream or a pan-India fare?
If one takes into account the latest statistics on box office collections, this seems to be an unambiguous trend. According to the latest FICCI-EY report, in the past three years, the box office collections (gross) of regional films have gone up to Rs 5,300 crore in 2022 from Rs 4,000 crore in 2019. In the same period, collections (gross) of
Hindi
films have fallen to Rs 3,500 crore in 2022 from Rs 5,200 crore in 2019.
Even as a percentage of the total box office collections (gross), regional films have trumped Hindi films. In the past three years, the share of regional films as a percentage of total box collections (gross) has gone up close to 42% in 2022 from about 30% in 2019. In the same period, the share of Hindi films as a percentage of total box collections (gross) has fallen close to 28% in 2022 from close to 39% in 2019.
Ameya Naik, founder-Fantasy Events, an event management company, said, ""Regional or especially
south Indian
films have excelled on two fronts. They tell universal stories which conform to the grammar of the Masala (medley of genres) genre with utmost conviction and commitment. Besides this, they have been able to create personal and culture-and-region-specific films with equal brilliance and charm.""
Live Events
He said, ""In the Hindi film industry, there are directors who specialise in genres. We don't have directors who can make a proper Masala film which would amalgamate genres such as drama, action, tragedy, music and scale and make entertaining pan-India films. I think director
Subhash Ghai
was the last of the lot. Even the so-called personal stories in Hindi films are not connecting with the pan-India audience. In essence, the Hindi film industry is making films based on dictates of producers rather than the singular vision of directors.""
This changed pattern in film viewing is more pronounced when one takes into account the contribution of Hindi dubbed collections to the total box office collection of south Indian films. For instance, 52% of the total collection of the
Kannada
film
KGF
: Chapter 2 came from the Hindi dubbed version of the film.
An analyst, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""It is estimated that 50% of viewers of regional films on streaming platforms are outside their home state. This shows the increasing acceptance of non-Hindi films. This is despite the fact that the number of Hindi films released in the past few years has increased dramatically."" He added, ""In the next three years, the consumption of regional content on television and streaming platforms is likely to increase to 61% and 50% from 54% and 30%, respectively, in 2020.""

The Zeenat Network: How the veteran actor is slaying Instagram game at 71,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/the-zeenat-network-how-the-veteran-actor-is-slaying-instagram-game-at-71/articleshow/100044042.cms,07-05-2023,"Every time
Zeenat Aman
posts something on
Instagram
, Usha Pisharody gets an alert on her phone. It’s a setting she has activated only for a handful of people, says the 60-year-old retired academician from Thrissur in Kerala. Pisharody remembers Aman, the 71-year-old Hindi film actress, as the “diva” she would go to watch in theatres back in the ’70s. “Zeenat [Aman] wasn’t just a glamorous celebrity for me, she seemed like a real person even back then,” she recalls.
Three months ago, Aman started her Instagram journey with a casual portrait picture and a single-line caption announcing her arrival on the platform. Every subsequent post from her has turned into a digital event that gets discussed across the internet. The veteran actor shares anecdotes from her career in cinema, gives a glimpse into her present life, talks about the people and issues that matter to her, sportingly shares memes featuring her and gives an insight into how and why she landed on the ’gram — courtesy of a little nudge and tech support from her sons.
In one of her posts, she even takes a friendly dig at most Instagram profiles, likening them to “advertising billboards”, all the while highlighting that she would like hers to retain the blogging essence and do very few, “clearly labelled” sponsored posts.
Aman has only a quarter of a million followers so far, but her Instagram account’s engagement rate is 16.61%, as per data gathered by Qoruz, a creator tech company.
Live Events
The figure is three-four times higher than what many popular celebrities on the platform command, including global pop culture icons like
Taylor Swift
and
Jennifer Aniston
, as well as popular Indian actors across age groups, like Alia Bhatt,
Ranveer Singh
,
Kareena Kapoor Khan
, Madhuri Dixit Nene and Jackie Shroff, to name a few. In absolute numbers, most of these celebrities’ content draws more eyeballs than Aman’s because of their significantly higher follower count at the moment.
For context, engagement rate measures what percentage of your audience engages with your content. To arrive at the percentage, you divide the total number of likes and comments on all posts by the total number of followers someone has, and then multiply the result by 100. Typically, analytics firms refine this formula for better results. Qoruz omits anomalies like unusually viral posts while calculating engagement rate to give a more accurate average figure.
“Zeenat Aman’s current engagement rate is phenomenal,” says Aditya Gurwara, cofounder of Qoruz. “Most big accounts (with a few million followers) tend to have 1-5% engagement rate,” he adds. “When her account reaches the million mark, if it is able to retain even half of this engagement rate, the absolute numbers will be impressive.”
Celebrity accounts can have an unusually high engagement rate at the beginning but it tends to normalise over time, notes Gurwara. “It happened in the case of both Jennifer Aniston and Kareena Kapoor Khan. Even their Instagram arrival was the talk of the town back then,” he adds. The surprisingly high engagement rate of Aman’s account is noteworthy as it does not follow any of the norms that supposedly get the platform’s algorithm to push content to more people’s feeds.
For instance, most Instagrammers, or IGers, post static images in a reel format for better traction and add a song in the background at minimum volume to ride the trending audio wave. Aman’s feed, however, has a grand total of two reels among 31 posts and they don’t align with an audio, meme-centric, or dancing trend.
One is the footage of an interview, during the shoot of the popular track “Laila O Laila” from Qurbani (1980), in which Aman talks about gender inequality in terms of opportunity and pay in the film industry at that time. The other reel features an image of her in her son’s music studio while the audio showcases her recital of a Derek Walcott poem titled “Love After Love”.
Aman’s post about there not being too many “silver-haired” women in the public eye resonated with Pisharody. On a platform where people admittedly show only the shiny parts of their life, Aman comes with no masks, says Pisharody. “You could say she had faded from public memory over time, but now her voice is helping many in our age group find theirs,” she adds.
ET reached out to Aman via her instagram account, requesting an interview for this story, but the message didn't elicit a response till press time.
While a few influencer marketing professionals believe the majority of Aman’s fan-following could belong to an older demographic, which can limit her reach on a platform dominated by the Gen Z cohort, the comments underneath her posts, some of them paragraph-long, indicate that she has a growing following of 20-somethings who make it a point to mention their age while leaving a comment.
Anushree Joshi is one such follower. “I haven’t grown up with Zeenat Aman or haven’t seen her captivate the audience in real time,” says the 22-year-old researcher and writer. Yet, when she sees her posts on people’s Instagram Stories, she finds herself visiting Aman’s page to read the caption, something she admittedly would not do for 95% of the Stories that appear on her feed.
“I suspect the reason I am drawn to her posts,” says Joshi, “is because of how authentic they seem, unfazed by popularity trends. She is not actively trying to be against the trends even, but gives me a sort of sweet nostalgia for what Instagram used to be at one point,” she adds. Aman has brought long captions back in vogue on Insta.
Her post honouring actor Parveen Babi on her birth anniversary spoke to Joshi about how the male gaze likes to limit women’s abilities and their relationships with each other. Aman didn’t cover the post in hashtags of “female friendships” or “girlbossing”, notes Joshi. Instead, “she shared a slice of her life and experience in a way you would hear an actual person talk to you if you were just sipping tea with them. It’s not dialogic for popularity’s sake, just thoughtful in the way a lifetime often ends up being when revisited quietly.”
Aman’s Instagram account has also shed a spotlight on 27-year-old Tanya Agarwal, who is credited as the photographer of many of the posts featuring the veteran actor. “There are definitely more eyes on my work now but, more than anything, I feel more in tune and confident in my ability as an artist,” says the Mumbai-based photographer, who was initially nervous about photographing “a legend”, a first for her. Agarwal, who is a friend of Aman’s son, is not surprised by the actor’s popularity on the platform. “Her way of expressing her thoughts is powerful enough to tame any algorithmic force,” she says.
Perhaps that explains why Aman’s only paid partnership on the platform so far, with jewellery brand Misho Designs, fetched twice as many likes (close to 109,000) as her regular posts. Branded posts are historically known to get lesser engagement. “The reason it did so well is that the audience that is otherwise bombarded with branded content on Instagram appreciated the authentic tone in which she spoke about choosing the brand and collaborating with it,” says Pankhuri Harikrishnan, founder of Fetch India, an influencer marketing agency based in Delhi.
In her recounting of stories from the ’70s showbiz era, Aman is reclaiming her narrative, which wasn’t a luxury that celebrities, especially women, had back then, notes Harikrishnan. “To that extent, she is unknowingly riding Instagram’s POV trend, by telling stories from her point of view.”

Phones must not disable FM radio by default: Government,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/phones-must-not-disable-fm-radio-by-default-government/articleshow/99996493.cms,05-05-2023,"The central government has issued an advisory saying that phones which are equipped with
frequency modulation
(FM) receivers and tuners should not disable the feature by default.
In phones where this feature is not included by default, efforts should be made to provide the service, according to the advisory issued by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (
MeitY
). ET has seen a copy of the advisory.
The disabling of the feature also impacted the central government's ability to disseminate real-time information, the ministry said in its advisory to mobile phone manufacturing companies' associations, the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association as well as the Manufacturers' Association for Information Technology.
It has asked the
ICEA
and
MAIT
to circulate this advisory among its members.
The advisory was issued after the IT ministry observed that there was a ""drastic fall"" with the FM tuners feature, which impacted the ability of the poor to get free FM radio services.
Live Events
""The FM broadcast is a robust and reliable communication system. FM stations serve as important communication links between the local authorities and people in times of natural disasters,"" the IT ministry advisory read.
FM technology is used to transmit superior-quality soundwaves over long distances.
FM Radios
usually operate in the 87.5 MHz to 108.5 MHz band. Since FM Radios operate in bands which have high bandwidth and low frequency, they are able to reach areas where even mobile connectivity is difficult.

Jury finds Ed Sheeran didn't copy Marvin Gaye classic,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/jury-finds-ed-sheeran-didnt-copy-marvin-gaye-classic/articleshow/99995550.cms,04-05-2023,"A jury concluded Thursday that British singer
Ed Sheeran
didn't steal key components of
Marvin Gaye
's classic 1970s tune ""Let's Get It On"" when he created his hit song ""Thinking Out Loud.""
As the New York jury answered the single question of whether
Sheeran
proved he didn't infringe upon the copyright in the affirmative, the crooner briefly put his hands over his face in relief before standing and hugging his lawyer.
The verdict came after a two-week trial that featured a courtroom performance by Sheeran as the singer insisted, sometimes angrily, that the trial was a threat to all musicians who create their own music.
Sheeran sat with his legal team throughout the trial, defending himself against the lawsuit by the heirs of
songwriter Ed Townsend
, who created the 1973 soul classic with Gaye. They said ""Thinking Out Loud"" had so many similarities to ""Let's Get It On"" that it violated the song's copyright protection.
At the trial's start, attorney
Ben Crump
told jurors on behalf of the Townsend heirs that Sheeran himself sometimes performed the two songs together. The jury saw video of a concert in Switzerland in which Sheeran can be heard segueing on stage between ""Let's Get It On"" and ""Thinking Out Loud.""
Crump
said that was ""smoking gun"" proof he stole from the famous tune.

When Sheeran testified, he repeatedly picked up a guitar resting behind him on the witness stand to demonstrate how he seamlessly creates ""mashups"" of songs during concerts to ""spice it up a bit"" for his sizeable crowds.
The English pop star's cheerful attitude on display under questioning from his attorney,
Ilene Farkas
, all but vanished under cross examination.
""When you write songs, somebody comes after you,"" Sheeran said during his testimony as he explained that the case was being closely watched by others in the industry.
He insisted that he stole nothing from ""Let's Get it On"" when he wrote his tune.
Townsend's heirs said in their lawsuit that ""Thinking Out Loud"" had ""striking similarities"" and ""overt common elements"" that made it obvious that it had copied ""Let's Get It On,"" a song that has been featured in numerous films and commercials and scored hundreds of millions of streams spins and radio plays in the past half century.
Sheeran's song, which came out in 2014, was a hit, winning a Grammy for song of the year. His lawyers argued that the songs shared versions of a similar and unprotectable chord progression freely available to all songwriters.
Gaye was killed in 1984 at age 44, shot by his father as he tried to intervene in a fight between his parents. He had been a
Motown
superstar since the 1960s, although his songs released in the 1970s made him a generational musical giant.
Townsend, who also wrote the 1958 R&B doo-wop hit ""For Your Love,"" was a singer, songwriter and lawyer who died in 2003.
Kathryn Townsend Griffin
, his daughter, testified during the trial that she thought Sheeran was ""a great artist with a great future.""
She said she had hoped the lawsuit would not result in a trial, ""but I have to protect my father's legacy.""

"Star Sports is now present in 9 out of 10 pay TV homes driven by the IPL fever, says Distribution Head Gurjeev Singh Kapoor",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/disney-star-is-now-present-in-9-out-of-10-pay-tv-homes-driven-by-the-ipl-fever-says-distribution-head-gurjeev-singh-kapoor/articleshow/99968502.cms,04-05-2023,"IPL
viewership has set new records this year and encashing on it,
Disney Star
, the official broadcaster, has added 11 million more paid subscribers in the first month of IPL and
Star Sports
has now increased reach to nine out of 10 Indian pay TV homes. In an interview with ET Online’s Gourab Das,
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor, Head - Distribution and International at Disney Star,
said they had a three-pronged approach ranging from working with affiliates to penetrate deeper into the markets to offering commentary in many regional languages.
How did your distribution numbers change in recent months, particularly with the ongoing
Indian Premier League
?
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor:
Before IPL started, Star Sports reached 8 out of 10 pay TV households and we went on a mission to take it further deep and we are happy to quote that after the first 20-25 days of IPL, we are present in 9 out of 10 pay TV homes. We have added 11 million homes by doing upselling and cross-selling through our partnership programs which we have run with our affiliates.
What has been the driving force behind this and what were your strategies?
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor:
IPL is a marquee property for subscriber growth. We collaborated deeply with our partners with the mission to take Star Sports to every household in the country. We worked out on a three-pronged strategy where we collaborated with our affiliate partners. This was not just transactional, but a complete collaborative work where we went with a joint vision in the market, with the aim of getting more subscribers and to delight & engage with them. We have worked with our partners to create joint marketing plans, not just with the MSOs and DTH partners, but also with their LCOs and DTH retailers, to attract new subscribers.

Just 29 matches in, DisneyStar breaks viewership record set in entire IPL 2022
Secondly, we focused on offering Star Sports as a part of our value packs which provides wholesome entertainment for families across genres. The third is our regionalisation strategy. By providing dedicated sports channels in multiple languages, we have given viewers the choice to enjoy their favourite sport in the language they are most comfortable in. This has been a game-changer in the industry.
The BARC results are out, and for the first 29 matches we had 409 million viewers, which is 37 million higher than the previous IPL edition. And the viewership saw a 24% increase in the first 29 matches.
We also came out with our interactive offerings for our customers and tied up with the likes of
Airtel
and Tata Play. Interactive features like instant highlights, key moments, and the stats feed were really appreciated by the subscribers.
Some IPL matches were broadcast for free on Star Utsav Movies. What was the strategy behind that for the free to air matches?

IPL viewership spike may draw in more advertisers, say experts
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor:
There is an audience on Free Dish who did not get to view IPL in the past and this strategy was to give an opportunity for the viewers on Free Dish to sample IPL. BARC estimates the Free Dish viewers to be about 42 million. We built a narrative and a campaign where we encouraged people to move from Free to Pay TV by just paying Rs 19 for Star Sports 1; and this really worked for us.
Do you have any data to see how many of these were transferred into the pay TV channels?
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor:
It is difficult to pinpoint on whether the new connections are coming from Free Dish or are they from reactivations or if they are new to the TV category as this information is not separately tracked. But if you look at the total number that I have mentioned before, I think the numbers speak for themselves. We have good subscriber growth coming in from the HSM market and this is a testament to the fact that our strategy has worked well for us.
Do you think the pricing of channels is fair at the moment?
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor:
After a period of four years, the regulator has allowed us to take an increase. In the past four years, we did not even get an inflationary increase. And even so, what we have done is for a channel like Star Sports, where the cost of rights have increased many folds, we have not even increased the price of Star Sports 1 HD or SD channels. So, the a-la-carte price of the channel remains at Rs 19.
We have not burdened any of our subscribers who are taking Star Sports on an a-la-carte basis. Even for our packages, we have been very mindful. We are aware that essentials are becoming expensive for the consumers at large and in this kind of a scenario, we need to be careful with our pricing strategy. Just to quote you an example, in the HSM market, we have taken price increases on packages not more than 10% and that 10% is after a period of four years. This strategy was to make sure that our viewers can continue watching their favourite content at affordable rates.
How has the adoption rate looked like for a-la-carte and packages?
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor:
While I can’t comment on the adoption rate, what I can tell you is that we are extremely thrilled with the response we have received for both our packages as well as a-la-carte offerings. Given the affordability element, it has been accepted very well. As mentioned, the sports channels are still available at Rs 19, and we have not burdened our subscribers with the increased cost of sporting rights which has gone up many folds.
What is the share of HD channels and the SD channels in viewership in India?
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor:
Let’s take a step back, I would like to talk about our channel mix as a network. We have 77 channels and out of these 40% are HD. In India, there is a good adoption of HD channels. According to BARC, today we have 75 million HD homes and our focus is to grow the HD market. People prefer watching Sports in HD as it provides a far superior viewing experience with features like a wider picture, five times sharper picture, and 5.1 Dolby surround sound making it a stadium like experience at home. Our Sports portfolio has 17 channels out of which seven are HD. In addition to Hindi and English HD channels, this year we launched two more HD sports channels, which are Star Sports 1 Tamil HD and Star Sports 1 Telugu HD.
As per BARC Data, for the first 29 matches of IPL, we have 66 million reach on HD, which is three times the reach from the previous IPL.
How much has the regional language commentary helped to lift viewership?
Gurjeev Singh Kapoor:
We have been pioneers in regionalisation of sports in the country. It has always been core to our strategy. This has been a big game changer since fans love watching sports in the language they understand and relate to. This year our IPL offering is in nine languages - English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bangla, Kannada, Marathi, Malayalam and Gujarati. This has been a big growth vector for us and we have seen good consumer traction in markets like West Bengal, AP/ Telangana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

National Film Development Corporation
(
NFDC
) has been ""left behind"" in the last few years, but it will restart backing projects and have its own OTT service, a senior government official said on Wednesday. The corporation, which has backed films like '
Gandhi
' and '
Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron
', will also have an over the top (OTT) service like Netflix where one can watch its films, Information and Broadcasting Secretary Apurva Chandra said.
""NFDC, we feel, has been left behind now for the past 8-10 years. We need to come back again, we need to give support to young filmmakers, who don't get access otherwise in the market, and also come up with an OTT of NFDC,"" Chandra said, speaking at the annual Ficci Frames event here.
The OTT will help those living in areas not having the choice of watching a movie in a theatre to enjoy the content, Chandra said.
He said the government, which has undertaken a Rs 500-crore project to preserve the country's film heritage, will also soon launch a scheme under which film aficionados can
fund
to restore a film of their choice.
The senior official from the ministry said work on the heritage project is already underway in Pune, but the government is constrained by resources to preserve the films and short films.

The government is likely to table an amendment to the Cinematograph Act in the monsoon session, which will authorise it to act against platforms distributing pirated content, Chandra said.
Given the high potential of the animation and gaming sector, the government is also looking at ways to start importing skills on this front from the school years itself so that the right talent can be honed, he said.
The official also said that a national centre of excellence coming up on a 20-acre plot in Mumbai's film city will be inaugurated next year.
The Maharashtra cadre officer, however, said that he is ""disappointed"" with the condition of the film city and rued that nothing has changed in the campus over the last 35 years from an infrastructure perspective.
The ministry is all for ""a soft touch approach"" on the critical issue of regulating content, and would want the OTT industry to adopt self-regulation, Chandra said, adding that there are ""murmurs"" of foul language being used.
Meanwhile, consultancy firm EY said the media and entertainment sector is over Rs 3 lakh crore right now, if one were to include the estimated Rs 90,000 crore that users pay to avail data services utilised for streaming.
The Rs 2.10 lakh-crore media and entertainment sector (excluding the data costs) is set to grow at over 10 per cent annually to reach Rs 2.83 lakh crore by 2025.
The sector has already surpassed the pre-Covid levels and is 10 per cent higher than the levels seen before the pandemic, EY said.

MIB asks state chief secretaries to impose ban on outdoor media online betting ads,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/mib-asks-state-chief-secretaries-to-impose-ban-on-outdoor-media-online-betting-ads/articleshow/99943672.cms,03-05-2023,"Mumbai:
The ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) has written a letter to the chief secretaries of all states and union territories asking them to curb advertisements by
online betting
and gambling platforms on outdoor media.
The letter follows similar advisories issued by the MIB against advertisements run by online betting and gambling platforms on TV, print, and digital media, including social media intermediaries like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
In his letter to the chief secretaries dated May 2, MIB secretary Apurva Chandra noted that online betting and gambling ads have been curbed in mainstream print, electronics, and digital media.
""While such advertisements have been largely curbed in mainstream print, electronic, and digital media, it has now come to the notice that some betting and gambling platforms have started using outdoor media such as hoardings, posters, banners, auto rickshaw branding, etc. to promote their websites/apps in India,"" Chandra said.
He also requested the chief secretaries to ensure that appropriate action is taken to curb outdoor advertisements for betting and gambling platforms.
Live Events
Offshore online betting platforms Fairplay, PariMatch, Betway, Wolf 777 and 1xBet have been advertising across TV, print, digital, and outdoor platforms through surrogate news websites. Many of them are also sponsoring on-ground properties to bypass the ad ban.
In 2020, the ad watchdog Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) issued guidelines for
online gaming
for real money winnings. The guidelines, which direct online
gaming
platforms to carry disclaimers about the risks associated with real-money
games
, came into effect on December 15.
Subsequently, TV broadcasters were asked to comply with the ASCI guidelines. In 2022, the MIB issued an advisory asking TV, print, and digital media platforms to refrain from airing or publishing
online betting ads
.
In December last year, the ministry also directed Google to stop displaying betting ads. The tech giant Google had issued a statement claiming it does not allow any online gambling ads in accordance with local Indian laws.
The MIB noted betting and gambling are illegal in most parts of the country as they pose financial, and socio-economic risks for consumers. The ministry issued multiple advisories last year asking the media to refrain from publishing such advertisements. These advisories, the MIB said, have been reiterated on April 6.

Satyajit Ray's 'Pather Panchali' and the song of the infrastructure,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/satyajit-rays-pather-panchali-and-the-song-of-infrastructure/articleshow/99928351.cms,02-05-2023,"Satyajit Ray
's 'Pather Panchali', the film that broke away from the cinema of the day, began with a bureaucratic sleight of hand. Struggling to fund the film, Ray had approached the West Bengal government which agreed to fund it. The story goes that the film was allocated money from the Public Works Department (PWD) since it was supposed to be about roads.
That was true of the title 'Pather Panchali' which meant 'the song of the road', but the film was certainly not about roads the way PWD would think about them. It was a clever bureaucratic workaround that categorised a masterly work of art as merely a film promoting roads, but it also foreshadowed the other misreadings to come.
The movie that defied categories
The movie Ray curated from a novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay with sculpted close-ups and painterly mise-en-scene had nothing of what went as filmmaking in India of those times. It was not the formulaic song-and-dance melodrama, the reigning style made popular by the Raj Kapoor-Nargis movies. Nor was it a movie with a megaphone, a sarkari movie that would preach the pieties of then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's gigantic nation-building project. Nor was it a Marxist morality play that must blame the rich for the state of the poor, if not also exact revenge for it.
Dileep Kumar's 'Naya Daur' was a heady cocktail of this genre mixed with a brash distillation of Gandhian idealism. The man-versus-machine movie showed a bus as a capitalist contraption that must be defeated by a horse cart. For decades to come, the horse cart kept winning the race against the bus in the minds of people as well as policymakers as socialist regimes curbed private enterprise and capital in innovative ways.

The poverty and the richness of imagination
'Pather Panchali' was the story of a penurious priest and scholar, who travels for months beating the dusty roads to find work and money; his wife, who is pounded by poverty and struggles to run the house; his unwanted elder sister, bent and shrivelled with age; and two curious kids who explore the bucolic world of their village. Harihar keeps hoping to make money from his literary writings. He needs to get the broken roof repaired and pay off debt. They often have little to eat. Amid all this misery, the kids, Apu and Durga, live in their own world of discovery and delight. Unrelenting hardship, deaths and ruin drive Harihar out of his ancestral village and put him on a long road to Kashi. Roads and journeys symbolise Harihar's search for a better life.
With 'Pather Panchali', Ray set the cat among the pigeons of Indian cinema, a rather infelicitous way of putting it but that's how it was. The clipped neorealism of the film that eschewed the usual sermons or solutions baffled many who could draw only one conclusion: the movie was poverty for poverty's sake, showing the bad side of India to westerns who wanted to see just that. Ray was accused of what later came to be known as orientalism, portraying oriental people in art and scholarship as poor, lazy, immoral and superstitious who attract western attention for being exotic. The bureaucracy was reluctant to send it as India's entry to the Cannes Film Festival until Nehru intervened and the film went on to win a special award at the Cannes. Nargis later accused Ray of peddling India's poverty to the West to win awards.
Dams, electricity, trains and roads
When Nargis, who had become an MP, was asked in an interview how else Ray should show India in his films, she said he should show dams in his films. Nehru had called dams, along with steel plants he built, the temples of modern India. Ray, though a friend of Nehru, had refused to bow at these temples which had caught public imagination when 'Pather Panchali' was released in 1955. India was embarking on its second Five-Year Plan that promised rapid industrialisation. It was a big step forward for India's economy after decades of economic distress. However, the gigantism of the Nehruvian economics could do little to help India's poor for whom food and clothes were the immediate concerns.
Nehru's industrial vision made a brief shimmer in 'Pather Panchali', which turned out to be its most memorable scene. The kids stumble across a pylon in a field they have strayed into and look at it in amazement. Just then they hear the whistle of the train and rush through a surreal landscape of tall grass with white flowers and watch the train roll by in wonder.
Nehru's miracles of electricity and trains were distant wonders for villagers, unable to touch their lives in any substantial way. When mainstream films were singing about these monuments of independent India's economy, 'Pather Panchali' depicted them as an ethereal vision of some alien beasts and not hugely transformative apparatus as they later proved to be.
As with all intricate pieces of art, 'Pather Panchali' told many stories and continues to speak to us even seven decades later. If the film was an allegory of India trying to find its destiny — in travels of Harihar and wanderings of Apu and Durga as well as Nehru's economics — today’s numerous highways and trains tell of an India rushing ahead to embrace that destiny, the aim to become an advanced economy. The song of the road did not die down; it became the song of the infrastructure, a full-throated celebration of roads and trains.
Gati
Shakti, the national master plan for multi-modal connectivity, might sound like the title of a Ray film while also reminding many of Nehru's own mega plans to fast-track India. In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pitch for a self-reliant India echoes a similar Nehruvian dream.
Collapsing houses, scarce food and torn clothes of 'Pather Panchali' no longer define much of India's poor. The infrastructure push that links cities, small towns and villages is likely to moderate the long journeys of the migrants as it helps spread development across the country. Skilling India's large number of youths and providing them jobs remain big challenges. Is India going to hit a happy ending that 'Pather Panchali' avoided? Like Ray's film that shunned easy judgments and a neat plot, the India story too is no song-and-dance melodrama; it is steeped in its own gritty neorealism.

PVR Inox chief calls upon studios to ramp up production for theatrical releases,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/pvr-inox-chief-calls-upon-studios-to-ramp-up-production-for-theatrical-releases/articleshow/99904739.cms,01-05-2023,"Filmmakers need to make more films for the big screen and produce films that are larger than life or mid-size to encourage audiences to keep coming back to the theatres,
PVR
Inox MD
Ajay Bijli
said during his keynote address at CinemaCon 2023 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
""We need studios to ramp up production to keep audiences coming back for more,"" he said, addressing the audiences at the global theatre industry trade show, which was held from April 24-27 this year.
Alluding to the trend of releasing films directly on over-the-top (
OTT
) platforms during the pandemic, Bijli urged the stakeholders to ensure that theatres remain the first window of film monetization. He also stated that increasing the theatrical window of a film is an idea whose time has come. In its earlier corporate presentation,
PVR
Inox stated that the theatrical window had been extended to eight weeks in India.
""With all the experimentation behind us, a theatrical window must stay. Windows have existed for decades, studios have created events around IP and made it more valuable. We need to maintain the monetization journey that's always been there for content. Increasing the window further is not a thought that we should shy away from,"" Bijli noted.
Weighing in on the theatre vs. streaming debate, Bijli said that the two platforms are here to coexist.
Live Events
""Consumers should be given a choice, but in such a manner that the overall pie of the film industry increases and everybody benefits and can co-exist. These are two completely different concepts for watching movies. It's utilitarian vs. experiential,"" he explained.
Pointing to the recent news that Apple and Amazon will invest more in content for theatres, Bijli hoped that other streamers would also follow suit.
Speaking about the PVR-Inox merger, Bijli said that the joint entity is now the fifth-largest listed multiplex chain globally.
PVR Inox, he added, attracts around 180 million annual admissions with revenues of $700 million annually. ""We currently operate approximately 1700 screens in 115 cities in India and Sri Lanka, and we're also very proud to have the highest admissions per screen per year of about 1,26,000 customers.""
Bijli also stated that cinema chains are India's top out-of-home entertainment destination. He said India has the highest number of admissions globally.
Furthermore, over 1800 films are produced in the country annually in over 20 languages. The Indian box office collection surpassed $1.3 billion in 2022.
""Consumers are looking for an out-of-home entertainment experience, and there is no compromise that we have made in delivering the wow factor right from the entry to the exit,"" Bijli said.
